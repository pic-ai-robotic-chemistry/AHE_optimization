CANADIAN JOURNAL OF ZOOLOGY				92	7			591	601		10.1139/cjz-2013-0183				JUL 2014	2014	Changes in environmental temperature can pose considerable challenges to animals and shifts in thermal habitat have been shown to be a major force driving species' adaptation. These adaptations have been the focus of major research efforts to determine the physiological or metabolic constraints related to temperature and to reveal the phenotypic characters that can or should adjust. Considering the current consensus on climate change, the focus of research will likely shift to questioning whether ectothermic organisms will be able to survive future modifications of their thermal niches. Organisms can adjust to temperature changes through physiological plasticity (e. g., acclimation), genetic adaptation, or via dispersal to more suitable thermal habitats. Thus, it is important to understand what genetic and phenotypic attributes-at the individual, population, and species levels-could improve survival success. These issues are particularly important for ectotherms, which are in thermal equilibrium with the surrounding environment. To start addressing these queries, we should consider what physiological or metabolic functions are responsible for the impact of temperature on organisms. Some recent developments indicate that mitochondria are key metabolic structures determining the thermal range that an organism can tolerate. The catalytic capacity of mitochondria is highly sensitive to thermal variation and therefore should partly dictate the temperature dependence of biological functions. Mitochondria contain a complex network of different enzymatic reaction pathways that interact synergistically. The precise regulation of both adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production depends on the integration of different enzymes and pathways. Here, we examine the temperature dependence of different parts of mitochondrial pathways and evaluate the evolutionary challenges that need to be overcome to ensure mitochondrial adaptations to new thermal environments.									52	1	0	0	51	0	52			0008-4301	1480-3283		WOS:000344954300004

By applying a conductive binder of sulfonated poly(thiophene-3-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]-2,5-diyl) (s-PT), the BN/s-PT composite film was successfully wrapped around each carbon fiber (CF) in the flexible carbon cloth (CC) substrate via a low-cost drop-coating method. Each CF in the CC provided a one-dimensional electron transfer core, and the wrapped BN/s-PT composite film functioned as the mesoporous electro-catalytic shell. Compared to pristine BN and pristine s-PT electrodes, the electrochemical and impedance performances of the BN/s-PT composite film were incredibly enhanced because of the synergetic effect of the BN nanoparticle and the s-PT binder; the former offered a large active surface area and a high intrinsic heterogeneous rate constant, and the latter formed fast electron transfer matrices. With a proper BN weight percentage among BN/s-PT solutions, the best DSSC coupling with a BN/s-PT composite counter electrode exhibited a good cell efficiency (eta) of 9.21% at 1 sun, showing a great potential to substitute the expensive platinum (8.11%). At the dim light environment (i.e., T5 fluorescent illumination), the DSSC reached attractive of 21.02% (6000 lux), 19.52% (3000 lux), and 17.48% (1000 lux).									15	1	0	0	1	0	15			2168-0485			WOS:000526363600029		
J	Xia, Zhonghong; Guo, Shaojun								Strain engineering of metal-based nanomaterials for energy electrocatalysis								CHEMICAL SOCIETY REVIEWS				48	12			3265	3278		10.1039/c8cs00846a				JUN 21 2019	2019	The strain effect, along with the ligand effect and synergistic effect, contributes primarily to the optimization of electrocatalytic activity and stability. The strain effect leads to a shift in the d-band center and alters binding energies toward adsorbates. Under electrocatalytic circumstances, the strain effect and ligand effect by and large function in combination; however, the decay and vanishing of the ligand effect precede the strain effect as the thickness of the shell in the core/shell structure or metallic overlayers on substrates increases. The strain effect on electrocatalytic activity can be well engineered by tuning the thickness of shells or atomic composition. Microstrain, or localized lattice strain, is another type of strain associated with structural defects such as grain boundaries and multi-twinning. In this review, we discuss the origin of the strain effect and how it affects electrocatalytic activity based on the d-band model. We present the structural characterization and quantitative determination of strain. Metal-based nanocrystals are basically grouped into two types of structures to which the strain engineering applies, i.e. lattice strain-associated structures (which include the general core/shell structure and solid solution alloy) and multiple defects-induced structures. Then analysis is performed on the correlation of strain and ligand effects and on the tuning strategies of the strain effect for electrocatalysis. After that, we use representative examples to demonstrate how strain engineering assists in typical electrocatalytic reactions on anodes and cathodes. Finally, we summarize and propose potential research areas in terms of enhancing electrocatalytic activities by strain engineering in the future.									220	12	0	0	14	0	223			0306-0012	1460-4744		WOS:000471797700009	31089609

Cyclic voltammograms obtained at 5 mV s(-1) showed a diffusion-limited current for H2O2 reduction, and the reduction current was proportional to H2O2 concentration. The current/concentration ratio increased with decreasing thermal decomposition temperature, indicating the sensitivity to H2O2 reduction is enhanced. Cyclic voltammetry also revealed that H2O2 reduction on IrO2-Ta2O5 catalysts was independent of a presence of azide ions as an anti-oxidant.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			1344-3542			WOS:000272748600003

The morphological changes due to this phase transformation might expose the underlying Si surfaces in alkaline solutions and result in critical stability issues. Here, we report that the incorporation of sulfur (S) into NiO films can not only accelerate the initial charge transfer characteristics but also alleviate the film strain by its rapid dissolution during the phase transformation, indicative of the prolonged photoelectrochemical (PEC) operation. Atomic layer deposition (ALD) chemistry using bis(dimethylamino-2-methyl-2-butoxy)nickel and hydrogen peroxide was introduced to grow thin NiO films and was applied to PEC water splitting for the first time. The growth rates, structures, surface roughness, work functions, and optical properties were fully studied by X-ray reflectivity, X-ray diffraction, atomic force microscopy, and ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy. The PEC properties of n-Si/NiO were investigated with different thicknesses of ALD-NiO and by incorporation with elemental S. We found that introducing S results in a rapid, yet uniform, conversion of cubic NiO to layered Ni(OH)(2)/NiOOH structures, avoiding cracks and delamination during electrochemical conditioning processes. Our Ni(OH)(2)/NiOOH on Si photoelectrodes from S-NiO showed stable and optimal performance under strong alkaline conditions (pH 13) for approximately 120 h at photocurrents of approximately 20 mA.cm(-2).									7	0	0	0	0	0	7			2574-0962			WOS:000537656400025

Understanding the growth mechanism of six-fold symmetrical materials is of fundamental interest and significance. Herein, we report the formation process of beta-Co(OH)(2)/Co(OH)F hierarchical hexagrams with a six-fold symmetrical arrangement. Our results demonstrate that hexagonal beta-Co(OH)(2) plates are first formed under the reaction condition. These hexagonal plates then act as templates for the growth of Co(OH)F nanorods. The intermediate material is therefore composed of plate-like beta-Co(OH)(2) hexagonal cores appended with six rod-like Co(OH)F branches, giving the beta-Co(OH)(2)/Co(OH)F hybrid. After prolonged reaction, the beta-Co(OH)(2) hexagons can be completely converted, leading to authentic six-branched Co(OH)F nanorods as the final product. Consequently, for both intermediate and final materials, the Co(OH)F nanorods are arranged with a six-fold symmetry. Importantly, these Co(OH)F nanorods grow along beta-Co(OH)(2) hexagon edges as lateral branches instead of perpendicular to hexagons. This uncommon epitaxial growth mechanism is considered to be a result of the matching between the b-axis of Co(OH)F crystals and the a-axis of beta-Co(OH)(2) crystals, which is beneficial for the electrocatalysis. The beta-Co(OH)(2)/Co(OH)F hierarchical hexagrams show enhanced water oxidation activity compared to the pure beta-Co(OH)(2) and Co(OH)F. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

The as-obtained Pd-Co3O4/C consists of amorphous Co3O4 and Pd. Amorphous Co3O4 nanoparticle acts as the "catalytic promoter" and ultra-low Pd is the active component. Compared to Pd/C, as-prepared Pd-Co3O4/C catalyst offers high mass activity and stability. This high catalytic performance arises from good synergetic effects between Pd and amorphous Co3O4, which makes the Pd-Co3O4/C promising for direct methanol fuel cells.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			1793-2920	1793-7094		WOS:000404858000013

The results clearly showed that the oxidation reactions of phenol followed first-order kinetics at all of three kinds of electrodes under experimental conditions and the electrode materials produced remarkable effects on apparent reaction rate and instantaneous current efficiency （ICE） of electrocatalytic oxidation of phenol. The apparent rate constants for Ti/SnO_2 ＋ Sb_2 O_3, Ti/SnO_2＋Sb_2O_3/PbO_2 and Ti/SnO_2 ＋Sb_2O_3/RuO_2 q-PbO_2 electrodes were 6.66 X 10 2 min~(-1), 2.49 *10~(-2) min~(-1) and 9.76* 10~(-3) min~(-1) at 25℃;, respectively, and the initial ICEs were 78.7%, 38.9% and 13.2% respectively. When Ti/SnO_2 ＋ Sb_2O_3 electrode was used as anode and the phenol solution was electrolyzed for 60 min, the concentration of phenol decreased from 2. 13* 10~(-3) mol· L~(-1) to 3.27* 10~(-3)mol· L~(-1) and the conversion of phenol reached 98.5%, but the conversion was only 82.7% and 29.8% for Ti/SnO_2 ＋Sb_2 O_3/PbO_2 and Ti/SnO_2＋ Sb_2 O_3/RuO_2＋PbO_2 electrodes, respectively. The voltammograms of the anodes in the phenol solution revealed that there was a higher oxygen evolution potential for Ti/SnO_2 ＋Sb_20_3 electrode, which was beneficial to the oxidation of organic compounds.			分别以自制的金属氧化物膜电极Ti／SnO_2＋Sb_2O_3、Ti／SnO_2＋Sb_2O_3／PbO_2和Ti／SnO_2＋Sb_2O_3／RuO_2＋PbO_2为阳极，恒电流电解低浓度苯酚溶液，研究了不同金属氧化物阳极对苯酚电催化氧化过程的影响。实验结果表明：在实验条件下，苯酚溶液在3种金属氧化物膜电极上的电催化氧化过程的宏观动力学符合一级反应动力学规律，但不同金属氧化物阳极上苯酚电催化氧化过程的表观反应速率及电流效率有明显的差异。25℃下苯酚在Ti／SnO_2＋Sb_2O_3、Ti／SnO_2＋Sb_2O_3／PbO_2和Ti／SnO_2＋Sb_2O_3／RuO_2＋PbO_2电极上电催化氧化的表观反应速率常数k分别为6．66*10~(-2)min~(-1)、2．49*10~(-2)min~(-1)和9．76*10~(-3)min~(-1)；瞬时电流效率随电解时间的增长而下降，初始电流效率分别为78．7％、38．9％、13．2％。以Ti／SnOz＋Sb_2O_3电极为阳极电解60min后，苯酚浓度从初始浓度2．13*10~(-3)mol·L~(-1)降至3．27*10^-4mol·L~(-1)，苯酚的转化率达98．5%；而在相同的反应条件下，以Ti／SnO_2＋Sb_2O_3／PbO_2和Ti／SnO_2＋Sb_2O_3／RuO_2＋PbO_2为阳极时，苯酚的转化率只有82．7％和29．8％。对3种电极在苯酚溶液中的伏安特性的研究表明，Ti／SnO_2＋Sb_2O_3电极具有比Ti／SnO_2＋Sb_2O_3／PbO_2和Ti／SnO_2＋Sb_2O_3／RuO_2＋PbO_2高的析氧电位，因此有利于有机物的氧化和过程电流效率的提高。						0	4	0	0	0	0	4			0438-1157			CSCD:2915785

Herein, we fabricated p-n homojunctions on the alpha-Fe2O3 by introducing both intrinsic (oxygen vacancies, Vo) and extrinsic (Cu2}) dopants into the hematite lattice through a two-step hydrothermal process followed by an annealing treatment. Such alpha-Fe2O3 composite film photoanodes were characterized by surface analysis and photoelectrochemical test, and exhibited great PEC photolytic water properties. The Ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) absorption results showed that the light absorption of the alpha-Fe2O3 with p-n homojunctions was greatly enhanced in the visible region. The introduction of intrinsic (Vo) and extrinsic (Cu2+) dopants into the alpha-Fe2O3 lattice enhanced the concentration of carriers by nearly two orders of magnitude, and the formation of the p-n homojunctions also effectively improved the separation efficiency of electron-hole pairs. The water oxidation photocurrent density of the alpha-Fe2O3 with the p-n homojunctions was measured to be 2.49 mA cm-2 at 1.23 V (vs. RHE), nearly two orders of magnitude higher than that of the pristine alpha-Fe2O3, and the reaction onset potential negatively shifted by more than 700 mV. Amazingly, the high potential photocurrent density at 1.6 V (vs. RHE) reached 4.79 mA cm(-2), which is a high value very competitive among all the reported hematite photoanodes under the same conditions. Moreover, the high photocurrent density could retain 87% even after 3 h, indicating that the alpha-Fe2O3 p-n homojunction photoanode has also stable photo-electrochemical performance.									3	0	0	0	2	0	3			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000774906600001

In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, there exist five peroxiredoxins, among which Tsa2p shares striking homology with the well described Tsa1p but has not been extensively studied. Here we report on the functional characterization of yeast tsa2Delta mutants and the comparison of TSA1 with TSA2. The tsa2Delta and tsa1 Delta tsa2Delta cells grew normally under aerobic conditions. However, the tsa1Delta tsa2Delta mutant yeast was more susceptible to oxidants than either tsa1Delta or tsa2Delta cells. Notably, the tsa1 Delta tsa2Delta yeast was also hypersensitive to peroxynitrite and sodium nitroprusside. This phenotype was rescued by the expression of either the TSA1 or TSA2 gene. The demonstration of a peroxynitrite reductase activity of Tsa2p in vitro points to a pivotal role for peroxiredoxins in the protection against nitrosative stress. In yeast cells, Tsa1p and Tsa2p exhibited comparable antioxidant activity. While the basal expression level of TSA1 was significantly higher than that of TSA2, the transcription of TSA2 was stimulated more potently by various oxidants. In addition, TSA2 was activated in tsa1Delta cells in a Yap1p-dependent manner. Taken together, our findings implicate the cooperation of Tsa1p and Tsa2p in the cellular defense against reactive oxygen and nitrogen species.									131	1	1	0	124	0	135			0021-9258	1083-351X		WOS:000173962900107	11741925

Much of the available data was acquired on large grains, which may not be fully rep-resentative of the presolar grain population present in meteorites. We present here new O isotopic data for 74 small presolar oxide grains (~& nbsp;200 nm in diameter on average) from Orgueil and Al-Mg isotopic systematics for 25 of the grains. Based on data-model comparisons, we show that (i) Group 1 and Group 2 grains more likely originated in low-mass first-ascent (red giant branch; RGB) and/or second-ascent (asymptotic giant branch; AGB) red giant stars and (ii) Group 1 grains with (Al-26/Al-27)(0) ' 5 x 10(-3 )and Group 2 grains with (Al-26/Al-27)(0) / 1 x 10-2 all likely experienced extra circulation processes in their parent low-mass stars but under different conditions, resulting in proton-capture reactions occurring at enhanced tem-peratures. We do not find any large( 25)Mg excess in Group 1 oxide grains with large( 17)O enrichments, which provides evidence that Mg-25 is not abundantly produced in low-mass stars. We also find that our samples contain a larger proportion of Group 4 grains than so far suggested in the literature for larger presolar oxide grains (> 400 nm). We discuss this observation in the light of stellar dust production mechanisms. (c) 2021 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			0016-7037	1872-9533		WOS:000783212700002

The performance of a photoelectrochemical device is determined in large part by the heterogeneous interface between the photoanode and the electrolyte, which we here characterize directly under operating conditions using interface-specific probes. Utilizing X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy as a noncontact probe of local electrical potentials, we demonstrate direct measurements of the band alignment at the semiconductor/electrolyte interface of an operating hematite/KOH photoelectrochemical cell as a function of solar illumination, applied potential, and doping. We provide evidence for the absence of in-gap states in this system, which is contrary to previous measurements using indirect methods, and give a comprehensive description of shifts in the band positions and limiting processes during the photoelectrochemical reaction.									36	1	0	0	1	0	36			1948-7185			WOS:000416291600019	29083905

We report that the complex [Co-4(H2O)(2)(PW9O34)(2)](10-), comprising a Co4O4 core stabilized by oxidatively resistant polytungstate ligands, is a hydrolytically and oxidatively stable homogeneous water oxidation catalyst that self-assembles in water from salts of earth-abundant elements (Co, W, and P). With [Ru(bpy)(3)](3+) (bpy is 2,2'-bipyridine) as the oxidant, we observe catalytic turnover frequencies for O-2 production >= 5 s(-1) at pH = 8. The rate's pH sensitivity reflects the pH dependence of the four-electron O-2-H2O couple. Extensive spectroscopic, electrochemical, and inhibition studies firmly indicate that [Co-4(H2O)(2)(PW9O34)(2)](10-) is stable under catalytic turnover conditions: Neither hydrated cobalt ions nor cobalt hydroxide/oxide particles form in situ.									1181	36	1	0	123	0	1200			0036-8075	1095-9203		WOS:000276685000033	20223949	
J	Sundstrom, H.; Gottschalk, C.								The evolution of ozone subsystems								Semiconductor International				29	10			58	65						Sept. 2006	2006	Ozone is a versatile oxidizer used in semiconductor applications, exhibiting many advantages for advanced manufacturing processes. Today, ozone continues to find additional industrial uses and is replacing traditional, more toxic chemicals as a highly effective, safer and more environmentally friendly alternative to more corrosive oxidants. The general characteristics of ozone, as well as its high redox potential, make it particularly suitable for semiconductor processing applications. There are two types of ozone delivery systems commonly used in semiconductor manufacturing: ozone gas delivery systems and DIO3 (ozone dissolved in deionized water) delivery systems.

However, the influence of the oxidation state with the different spins of Fe ion in FeN4C on the electrochemical mechanisms of conversion of CO2 to CO/ HCOOH remains unclear. Herein, we got insight into the influence on the CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) catalyzed by single-Fe coordinated by four pyridinic N ligands (Fe-II/(N4C)-N-III) using density functional theory calculations. Our calculations revealed that the two-electron CO2RR takes place via two sequential proton-coupled electron-transfer reactions with proton transfer from a N or C site on the FeN4C surface to CO2 and at the same time electron transfer from FeN4C to CO2. The potential energy analyses uncovered that the energy barrier (0.72/0.52 eV) of the rate-limiting step for the CO/HCOOH formation catalyzed by the middle spin (FeN4CM)-N-II is lowest among the two oxidation states with the different spins. In addition, the overpotential (-0.03/0.29 V) of the *CO/*HCOOH formation catalyzed by (FeN4CM)-N-II is also significantly lower than these of the other cases. Both confirm that the Fe2+ ion with the middle spin in FeN4C is most favorable for the conversion of CO2 to CO/HCOOH. These findings thus provide valuable information to develop new strategies for designing more efficient Fe single-atom catalysts.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			1932-7447	1932-7455		WOS:000707043000015

Four different AOX isoforms were identified in the chickpea genome: CaAOX1 and CaAOX2A, B and D. CaAOX2A was the most highly expressed form and was strongly expressed in photosynthetic tissues, whereas CaAOX2D was found in all organs examined. These results are very similar to those of previous studies with soybean and siratro. Searches of available databases showed that this pattern of AOX genes and their expression was common to at least 16 different legume species. The evolution of the legume AOX gene family is discussed, as is the in vivo impact of an inherently high AOX capacity in legumes on growth and responses to environmental stresses.									11	2	0	0	8	0	13			0140-7791	1365-3040		WOS:000454110900006	29424926

This phenomenon has been hypothetically explained by preferential attachment principle that the new-recruited metabolites attach preferentially to those that are already well connected. However, since metabolites are usually small molecules and metabolic processes are basically chemical reactions, we speculate that the metabolic network organization may have a chemical basis. In this paper, chemoinformatic analyses on metabolic networks of Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG), Escherichia coli and Saccharomyces cerevisiae were performed. It was found that there exist qualitative and quantitative correlations between network topology and chemical properties of metabolites. The metabolites with larger degrees of connectivity (hubs) are of relatively stronger polarity. This suggests that metabolic networks are chemically organized to a certain extent, which was further elucidated in terms of high concentrations required by metabolic hubs to drive a variety of reactions. This finding not only provides a chemical explanation to the preferential attachment principle for metabolic network expansion, but also has important implications for metabolic network design and metabolite concentration prediction.									10	0	0	0	5	0	10				1553-7358		WOS:000297262700037	22022254

In both reactors, TCE had a toxic effect on two uncultured bacterial populations whereas oxygen favoured the growth of aerobic species belonging to Rhizobiaceae and Dechloromonas. No methanotrophic bacteria were detected when targeting 16S rRNA gene with universal primers. Alternatively, pmo gene encoding the particulate methane monooxygenase of Methylomonas sp. LW21 could be detected in the coupled reactor when H2O2 was supplied at 0.7 g O-2 l(g)(-1) day(-1).Conclusions: Methylomonas sp. LW21 that could be responsible for the aerobic degradation of the TCE by-products is not among the predominant bacterial populations in the coupled reactor. It seems to have been outcompeted by heterotrophic bacteria (Rhizobiaceae and Dechloromonas sp.) for oxygen.Significance and Impact of the Study: The results obtained show the limitations of the coupled reactor examined in this study. Further investigations should focus on the operating conditions of this reactor in order to favour the growth of the methanotrophs.									18	0	0	0	17	0	18			1364-5072	1365-2672		WOS:000226398500020	15659198

However, the Z-scheme heterojunctions based on metal-organic frameworks were rarely reported. Herein, a novel oxygen-defective ZnO (O-ZnO)/reduced graphene oxide (rGO)/UiO-66-NH2 Z-scheme heterojunction has been prepared by a facile solvothermal route. The morphologies, structures, and photoelectric characteristics of the acquired materials were characterized in detail. The photocatalytic activity of the O-ZnO/rGO/UiO-66-NH2 heterostructure was assessed by photocatalytic CO2 reduction. The results indicated that the O-ZnO/rGO/UiO-66-NH2 heterostructure could efficiently reduce CO2 to CH3OH and HCOOH, and its activity was significantly superior to that of O-ZnO/UiO-66-NH2 and ZnO/rGO/UiO-66-NH2. Under illumination of visible light, the yield of CH3OH and HCOOH over the O-ZnO/rGO/UiO-66-NH2 heterostructure reached 34.83 and 6.41 mu mol g(-1) h(-1) respectively. The high photoactivity of the O-ZnO/rGO/UiO-66-NH2 heterostructure should be caused by the effective spatial separation of photogenerated electrons and holes via a Z-scheme charge transfer. This research may well present an insight into the design and fabrication of novel Z-scheme photocatalytic systems for environmental remediation and energy conversion.									125	6	0	0	16	0	125			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000455561200057	30537805

Upon substitution of one of the Fe atoms in the hematite surface, we observed a promoting effect of the substitution, upon which the overpotential required for the water-splitting reaction decreased in all substitution sites investigated. The cobalt site itself, however, does not exhibit the improved properties with respect to the undoped hematite. The promoting effect results purely from the altering of the properties of the nearest Fe atoms in the hematite surface. We conclude that the overpotential is reduced upon formation of the structure resembling the O-2 molecule strongly interacting with the surface between the Co and Fe sites, and this is consistent with the catalytic activity of the surface vacancies of the hematite.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			1948-7185			WOS:000538759600024	32352787

So far, such interactions have been rarely explored to enhance the selectivity in the electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR). Herein, Cu/CeO2-x, heterodimers (HDs) are synthesized and presented as one of the prime examples where such effects promote CO2RR, A colloidal seeded-growth synthesis is developed to connect the two highly mismatched domains (Cu and CeO2-x) through an interface. The Cu/CeO2-x HDs exhibit state-of-the-art selectivity toward CO2RR (up to similar to 80%) against the competitive hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and high faradaic efficiency for methane (up to similar to 54%) at -1.2 V-RHE, which is similar to 5 times higher than that obtained when the Cu and CeO2-x nanocrystals are physically mixed. Operando X-ray absorption spectroscopy along with other ex-situ spectroscopies evidences the partial reduction of Ce4+ to Ce3+ in the HDs during CO2RR A Density Functional Theory (DFT) study of the active site motif in reducing condition reveals synergistic effects in the electronic structure at the interface. The proposed lowest free energy pathway utilizes an O-vacancy site with intermediates binding to both Cu and Ce atoms, a configuration which allows one to break the CHO*/CO* scaling relation. The suppression of HER is attributed to the spontaneous formation of CO* at this interfacial motif and subsequent blockage of the Cu-sites.									75	10	0	0	5	0	76			2155-5435			WOS:000471212600031

Recently, nitrogen incorporation has proven to be able to fine-tune the electron densities of exposed active sites to create high-performance electrocatalysts. The preservation of a strong interface between the local atomic coordination of nitrogen atoms on bare carbon, single metal atoms, transition metal oxides, metal chalcogenides, and MXenes during synthesis plays an important role in producing an efficient electrocatalysts. In addition, the ability of nitrogen atoms to bind with carbon or metal atoms can be influenced by processing conditions. In this regard, this review is the first comprehensive overview of the range of synthetic strategies to form nitrogen incorporated catalysts and assess their chemical, structural, physical electronic property modification and their influence on electrocatalytic ORR, OER, and HER performance. This review will describe how specific strategies have been utilized to realise effective electrocatalytic systems, including the energy conversion of nitrogen incorporated catalysts, structural coordination, and material optimization. Finally, the main challenges to be considered in future investigations in order to initiate new research efforts in this promising research area are discussed.

While the purpose of ML methods is often to circumvent computationally expensive first-principles calculations, the fact that the inner workings of the models are not understood conceals chemical insight and knowledge regarding the underlying data and physical correlations within it. Knowing what a model is learning from the data and how outputs are formed is also useful in facilitating the justification and wider adoption of ML solutions. Here, we present an important contribution in this direction by exploring and explaining the hydrogen adsorption properties of defective nitrogen-doped carbon nanotubes (NCNTs) through density functional theory simulations and machine learning-based data analysis. As the main highlight, we demonstrate the application of a recent game-theoretic approach to deconvolute and interrogate the trained ML models, revealing how various structural, chemical, and electronic features contribute toward the hydrogen affinities of roughly 6500 different NCNT adsorption sites. The employed method of Shapley additive explanations (SNAP) attributes locally accurate importances to the investigated features, unraveling high spin polarization, narrow highest occupied molecular orbital-lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (HOMO-LUMO) gap, small dopant-adsorption site separation, and diverse angle and coordination effects as particularly impactful for increasing hydrogen adsorption strengths. The SNAP method is shown capable of promoting a deep understanding of complex feature-activity relationships, facilitating research efforts such as rational catalyst design for energy conversion applications.									7	0	0	0	0	0	6			1932-7447	1932-7455		WOS:000680445800016

However, MnO2 usage has been limited to its low reaction reversibility and poor conversion kinetics. Besides, Li-ion hybrid supercapacitors (LiHSCs) are in urgent demand which offers higher power densities than LIBs without compromising energy density. Among different polymorphs of MnO2, lambda-MnO2, due to its 3D spinel structure, can be applied in many applications. Usually, lambda-MnO2 can be obtained by extracting lithium from LiMn2O4 using complex electrochemical or acid leaching methods. This study presents a modified Li2O2 assisted method to obtain cobalt-doped 3D architectures of lambda-MnO2 porous hollow nanostructures. The resultant MnxCo1-xOy hollow structures with 5 % cobalt addition are used as anode for LIBs exhibited excellent charge reversibility and cycle stability over thousands of reaction cycles. This result is known to be one of the finest among MnO2 anodes reported to date. Also, a LiHSC device is fabricated with MnxCo1-xOy hollow structures as anode and the device exhibits an excellent comprehensive electrochemical performance in terms of high operating voltage (4.2 V), with a specific cell capacity of 33 mAh g(-1) at a high current density of 5 A g(-1) and achieved the maximum power density of 12261 W kg(-1) (with energy density at 81.7 Wh kg(-1)) with long cycle life.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			2365-6549			WOS:000680028800004

As one of the essential components of energy storage and conversion devices, electrode materials play a crucial role in overall device performances. Conventional material preparation methods, including hydrothermal, chemical vapor deposition, high temperature solid phase methods, etc., are often subject to harsh preparation conditions. Therefore, much simpler and more efficient preparation methods are still sought after by the research community. In recent years, ion exchange (IE) technology, as a novel method for syntheses of nanomaterials, has attracted a great deal of research attention for its great capability in precise structural design and simultaneous regulation of component compositions. Nevertheless, the links among reaction mechanisms, resulting products, and product application performances, have not been fully elaborated. Herein, this review systematically summarizes historical developments of the IE technology for preparation of nanomaterials and relevant reaction mechanisms from both kinetic and thermodynamic perspectives. A detailed summary of recent applications of the IE technology for preparation of a wide variety of nanomaterials and their applications in electrochemical energy storage and conversion devices, including supercapacitors, lithium/sodium-ion batteries, electrolytic water splitting, and hydrogen fuel cells, is presented. In-depth understanding of the IE technology provides better technical approaches for fabrication of high-performance electrode materials. In the final section, an outlook on the IE technology is offered.									8	0	0	0	0	0	8			2405-8297			WOS:000684961700004

New insights into electronic as well as chemical processes that drive water decomposition were obtained by varying the position of the NPs on top and at different depths inside the semiconductor film. This work highlights the synergetic effect of UV and visible light on the photocatalytic activity of all the Au-containing structures: hydrogen produced under UV + Vis light shows 100% enhancement compared to the net production obtained under either UV or visible light alone. The systems where Au NPs are embedded in TiO2 outperform the one where NPs are positioned on the surface, indicating that the water-splitting reaction occurs primarily on the TiO2 surface rather than on the metal. Photocurrent and photocatalytic activity measurements under UV (353-403 nm), visible (400-1100 nm), and UV + Vis (300-1100 nm) light revealed the synergetic contribution of UV and Vis light. Indeed, the plasmonic Au NPs create an intense oscillating electric field at the Au NPs/semiconductor interface (visible light contribution); this mechanism coupled with the Schottky barrier formation generates hot electrons resulting in a better photoexcited charge separation. In addition, contrary to what is generally assumed, charge injection by the plasmon from the metal into the semiconductor plays a marginal role in the hydrogen evolution reaction. Furthermore, this paper highlights the positive impact of the semiconductor crystallinity surrounding the metal particles to avoid the charge carrier recombination and the importance of a surface free of oxygen vacancies, whose presence can inhibit the water decomposition.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			1932-7447	1932-7455		WOS:000592958800028

As several Co- containing compounds have proved to be good catalysts for water oxidation, the activities of the two new compounds were compared with the previously found oxohalide Co5Se4O12Cl2 in reference to CoO and CoCl2. The one electron oxidant Ru(bpy)(3)(3+) was used as oxidizing species in a phosphate buffer and it was found that the activities of the oxohalide species were in between CoO and CoCl2.

A molecular mechanics force field was developed and employed to model both the originally proposed bis-manganese complex 1 and the revised structure 7. Related manganese complexes were also modelled with reasonable accuracy compared to their X-ray crystal structures.

The ever-growing research on this fascinating material is due to its unique visible light absorption, surface, electrocatalytic, and other physicochemical properties that can be useful to different energy conversion and storage applications. Photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting reaction is one of the promising applications of g-C3N4, wherein it acts as a durable catalyst support material. Very recently, the construction of g-C3N4-based binary and ternary heterostructures exhibited superior PEC water splitting performance owing to its reduced reunion of e-/h+ pairs and the fast transfer of charge carriers at the heterostructure interface. This review compiles the recent advances and challenges on g-C3N4-based heterostructured photocatalysts for the PEC water splitting reaction. After an overview of the available literature, we presume that g-C3N4-based photocatalysts showed enhanced PEC water splitting performance. Therefore, it is believed that these materials have tremendous opportunities to act as durable catalyst support for energy-related applications. However, researchers also considered several limitations and challenges for using C3N4 as an efficient catalyst support material that must be addressed. This review article provides an overview of the fundamental principles of PEC water splitting, the current PEC water splitting research trends on g-C3N4-based binary and ternary heterostructured electrodes with respect to different electrolytes, and the other key factors influencing their photoelectrochemical performance. Finally, the future research direction with several recommendations to improve the photocatalytic efficiency of these materials is also provided at the end.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2				2227-9717		WOS:000724795600001

Cyclic alkanes constitute a large fraction of aliphatic hydrocarbon emissions originating from incomplete combustion of diesel fuel and motor oil. In the present study, cholestane (C27H48) is used as a model system to examine the OH-initiated heterogeneous oxidation pathways of cyclic alkanes in a photochemical flow tube reactor. Oxidation products are collected on filters and analyzed by a novel soft ionization two-dimensional gas chromatography/mass spectrometry technique. The analysis reveals that the first-generation functionalization products (cholestanones, cholestanals, and cholestanols) are the dominant reaction products that account for up to 70% by mass of the total speciated compounds. The ratio of first-generation carbonyls to alcohols is near unity at every oxidation level. Among the cholestanones/cholestanals, 55% are found to have the carbonyl group on the rings of the androstane skeleton, while 74% of cholestanols have the hydroxyl group on the rings. Particle-phase oxidation products with carbon numbers less than 27 (i.e., "fragmentation products") and higher-generation functionalization products are much less abundant. Carbon bond cleavage was found to occur only on the side chain. Tertiary-carbon alkoxy radicals are suggested to play an important role in governing both the distribution of functionalization products (via alkoxy radical isomerization and reaction with oxygen) and the fragmentation products (via alkoxy radical decomposition). These results provide new insights into the oxidation mechanism of cyclic alkanes.									19	1	0	0	1	0	19			1089-5639	1520-5215		WOS:000327812800025	24152093

Recently, multiple isoforms and homologs for OEC proteins have been identified in the chloroplast thylakoid lumen, indicating that functional diversification has occurred in the OEC family. Gene expression profiles suggest that the Arabidopsis OEC proteins are roughly categorized into three groups: the authentic OEC group, the stress-responsive group, and the group including proteins related to the chloroplast NAD(P)H dehydrogenase (NDH) complex involved in cyclic electron transport around PSI. Based on the above gene expression profiles, molecular functions of the OEC family proteins are discussed together with our current knowledge about their functions.									54	4	0	0	52	0	59			1672-9072	1744-7909		WOS:000280356900005	20666928	
J	Vargas, Walter A.; Weyman, Philip D.; Tong, Yingkai; Smith, Hamilton O.; Xu, Qing								[NiFe] Hydrogenase from Alteromonas macleodii with Unusual Stability in the Presence of Oxygen and High Temperature								APPLIED AND ENVIRONMENTAL MICROBIOLOGY				77	6			1990	1998		10.1128/AEM.01559-10				MAR 2011	2011	Hydrogenases are enzymes involved in the bioproduction of hydrogen, a clean alternative energy source whose combustion generates water as the only end product. In this article we identified and characterized a [NiFe] hydrogenase from the marine bacterium Alteromonas macleodii "deep ecotype" with unusual stability toward oxygen and high temperature. The A. macleodii hydrogenase (HynSL) can catalyze both H-2 evolution and H-2 uptake reactions. HynSL was expressed in A. macleodii under aerobic conditions and reached the maximum activity when the cells entered the late exponential phase. The higher level of hydrogenase activity was accompanied by a greater abundance of the HynSL protein in the late-log or stationary phase. The addition of nickel to the growth medium significantly enhanced the hydrogenase activity. Ni treatment affected the level of the protein, but not the mRNA, indicating that the effect of Ni was exerted at the posttranscriptional level. Hydrogenase activity was distributed similar to 30% in the membrane fraction and similar to 70% in the cytoplasmic fraction. Thus, HynSL appears to be loosely membrane-bound. Partially purified A. macleodii hydrogenase demonstrated extraordinary stability. It retained 84% of its activity after exposure to 80 degrees C for 2 h. After exposure to air for 45 days at 4 degrees C, it retained nearly 100% of its activity when assayed under anaerobic conditions. Its catalytic activity in the presence of O-2 was evaluated by the hydrogen-deuterium (H-D) exchange assay. In 1% O-2, 20.4% of its H-D exchange activity was retained. The great stability of HynSL makes it a potential candidate for biotechnological applications.									27	0	0	0	19	0	28			0099-2240	1098-5336		WOS:000288203500008	21257809

In this paper, a novel, high-efficiency electrocatalyst composed of silver-platinum hollow nanodendrites based on N doping graphene quantum dots (N-GQDs/AgPt HNDs), which were synthesized via an easy wet chemical method, for the methanol oxidation reaction (MOR) is demonstrated. The pho-tomediated Ag/N-GQDs nanoparticles (Ag/N-GQDs NPs) were firstly prepared under the condition of visible light illumination (the central wavelength is 589 nm), and then galvanic replacement reaction occurred between PtCl(6)(2-)and Ag nanoparticles to obtain the final product. The morphology of the catalyst exhibits a uniform hollow structure by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and energy-dispersive X-ray spec-troscope (EDX). The effects of the different mole ratio of Ag/Pt on the catalytic activity have been studied by cyclic voltammetry (CV) and chronoamperometry (CA). Under the optimal conditions, N-GQDs/AgPt HNDs show the excellent electrocatalytic activity of 2207.6 mA mg(Pt)(-1) towards MOR, which is about 21-fold higher than that of the commercial Pt/C. Interestingly, the photomediated Ag/N-GQDs NPs also caused the N-GQDs/AgPt HNDs catalysts to display a 1.7-fold enhancement in catalytic activity compared to that of the untreated Ag/N-GQDs NPs. Moreover, the CO tolerance and stability of the catalysts for MOR are also greatly improved. The present approach would provide an environment-friendly and valuable way to prepare multi-component catalysts with hollow nanostructures. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V.

Particularly, novel layered compounds have tremendous influence in various research fields. Advanced fundamental studies covering various aspects, including reactants and synthetic methods, are required to obtain novel layered materials with unique physical and chemical properties. Among the promising synthetic techniques, topochemical approaches have afforded the platform for widening the extent of novel 2D materials. Notably, the synthesis of binary layered materials is considered as a major scientific breakthrough after the synthesis of graphene as they exhibit a wide spectrum of material properties with varied potential applicability. In this review, a comprehensive overview of the progress in the development of metastable layered compounds is presented. The various metastable layered compounds synthesized from layered ternary bulk materials through topochemical approaches are listed, followed by the descriptions of their mechanisms, structural analyses, characterizations, and potential applications.

The results show that the calcination temperature has significant influence on the surface microstructure including the crystallinity and the preferred orientation of IrO2 crystallite of the formed IrO2-Ta2O5 binary oxide. The IrO2 phase is partially amorphous at low calcination temperature in the present study. The (101) IrO2 planes dominates at low or moderate calcination temperatures, whereas the (110) IrO2 orientation was preferred at the highest calcination temperature. Surface morphology of the anodes was revealed as mud-cracks surrounded by a flat area with plenty of scattered nano-IrO2 crystallites. The size of the nano-IrO2 crystallites is calcination temperature dependent, which in turn determines the electrochemical active surface area (ECSA). In this IrO2-Ta2O5 binary oxides coating, (101) IrO2 was found to have higher catalytic activity than (110) IrO2 with respect to the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The moderate temperature is suggested as the best calcination temperature for this certain anode regarding the ECSA, electrocatalytic activity for OER and stability potential.

Compared with Ti/Ti4O7 anode, Ti/TiO2-NTA/ Ti4O7 anode exhibited higher oxygen evolution potential (2.40 V), larger active specific surface areas (1.81 m(2) g(-1)), stronger radical generation capacity (64.42 mu M), longer accelerated service life (56.0 h), and superior favipiravir removal ratio. The flow-through electrochemical reaction system was constructed by using the porous Ti/TiO2-NTA/Ti4O7 anode. The removal ratio, TOC removal ratio and mineralization current efficiency of favipiravir in the flow-by electrochemical system were significantly improved and the energy consumption was reduced compared with the conventional flow-by electrochemical system, verifying the superiority of the porous flow-through Ti/TiO2-NTA/Ti4O7 anode. The effects of operating parameters on the removal of favipiravir in the flow-through electrochemical reaction system were investigated. The degradation mechanisms of favipiravir are the synergetic effects of the free radical (.OH and SO4 center dot-) and the direct electron transfer. Ti/TiO2-NTA/Ti4O7 anode displayed excellent stability in five consecutive cycles, exhibited significant removal ratio (87.7%) of favipiravir from actual wastewater, and remained efficient and versatile for a wide range of typical PPCPs pollutants. Therefore, Ti/TiO2-NTA/Ti4O7 is a promising porous anode material in the engineering application.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0013-4686	1873-3859		WOS:000863290900003

However, they often suffer from high cost, low selectivity, poor durability, and susceptibility to gas poisoning with adverse environmental issues. As a low-cost alternative, the first carbon-based metal-free catalyst (C-MFC based on N-doped carbon nanotubes) was discovered in 2009. Since then, various C-MFCs have been demonstrated to show similar or even better catalytic performance than their metal-based counterparts, attractive energy conversion and storage (e.g., fuel cells, metal-air batteries, water splitting), environmental remediation, and chemical production. Enormous progress has been achieved while the number of publications still rapidly increases every year. Herein, a critical overview of the very recent advances in this rapidly developing field during the last couple of years is presented.									47	5	0	0	0	0	48			0935-9648	1521-4095		WOS:000484129400003	30785214

The experiments were performed using a symmetrical plane-to-plane of electrodes configuration in order to improve the treatment homogeneity and also to compare the treatment efficiency when the aPS is on the cathode or on the anode. During these experiments, the pressure and the electrical conditions were maintained unchanged. The experimental results were compared for the two positions of samples, when the gap length and the afterglow duration time were varied. It appears that the treatment depends on the sample position and an interpretation is proposed. The physical conditions and the reaction processes in the plasma bulk and on the aPS surface were analysed in order to understand their influence on the surface treatment. The importance of metastables is pointed out and it is deduced that these long-life excited states are firstly produced near the anode and fill the gap following the evolution and distribution of the electron current density.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			1286-0042	1286-0050		WOS:000227184800008

The introduced PSS reduces the threading dislocation (TD) density and defects of the GaN epilayer, resulting in the improved crystalline quality, which suppresses recombination of electron-hole pairs. A single-step top-down etching approach is developed to fabricate the nanoporous GaN using an anodic aluminum oxide (AAO) mask conveniently and economically. The highly ordered nanoporous morphologies of AAO membrane are well transferred into the GaN surface grown on PSS via inductively coupled plasma (ICP) dry etching. Surface nanostructuring significantly increases surface-volume ratio of GaN, more incident light is trapped and absorbed by nanoporous structure, and the unabsorbed light scattered by PSS upwards is re-absorbed in nanoporous GaN. The ultraviolet light absorptance and reflectance of nanoporous GaN grown on PSS were improved significantly, close to 89% and 9% respectively. The resulting improved absorption in the nanoporous GaN further enhances the generation of photocarriers. The increasing surface-volume ratio also contributes to increasing of photoelectrochemical (PEC) reaction area and photocarrier separation efficiency, decrease of photocarrier migration distance towards the GaN-electrolyte interface, more holes participate in the PEC reaction, leading to an improved PEC efficiency and photocurrent density by 470% times with respect to planar counterpart. This work will pave the way towards low-cost and mass production of nanoporous GaN photoelectrode for efficient solar water splitting. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Hydrazine and its derivatives have been experimentally demonstrated to be effective in the reduction of Np-VI to Np-V. In this work, hydrazine was used as a representative reductant and the reduction mechanisms of Np-VI induced by hydrazine were investigated using density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Three reaction pathways were taken into account and characterized by gradually transferring a hydrogen atom from N2H4 to the "yl"-oxygen of [(NpO2)-O-VI(H2O)(5)](2+) followed by the valence state adjustment from Np-VI to Np-V. The calculated results of the potential energy profiles (PEPs) revealed that Pathway I should be the most likely to occur as the process of forming (N2H3)-N-center dot is considered to be the rate-determining step with the highest energy barrier of 32.02 kcal mol(-1), which is in favor of the experimental results. Pathway II hardly occurs and Pathway III probably occurs. The bonding evolution, along with the reaction pathways, was explored through natural bond orbitals (NBOs), quantum theory of atoms-in-molecules (QTAIM) and electron localization function (ELF) analyses. This work can shed light on the understanding of redox mechanisms of Np-VI with N2H4 and its derivatives and help further attempts to design more efficient reductants for the separation of U/Np and Np/Pu in spent nuclear fuel reprocessing in the near future.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6				2046-2069		WOS:000389342800101		
J	Horvat-Radosevic, V; Kvastek, K; Vukovic, M; Cukman, D								Electrochemical properties of ruthenised electrodes in the oxide layer region								JOURNAL OF ELECTROANALYTICAL CHEMISTRY				482	2			188	201		10.1016/S0022-0728(00)00048-6				MAR 20 2000	2000	The impact of increasing the amount of electrodeposited ruthenium and of potential/time treatment of ruthenium substrates on the electrochemical properties of anodically formed ruthenium oxide films, are investigated by use of cyclic voltammetry, electrochemical quartz crystal microbalance, anodic and cathodic current transients, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. In addition to the specific interpretation of results obtained by each of the techniques used, general discussion in terms of the essential charge storage characteristics of ruthenium oxide films is presented. It is shown that an increase in the ruthenium loading acts beneficially on the stability of oxide films over a range of potentials, but detrimentally on the kinetics of the overall charging/discharging reaction, which becomes proton mass transfer limited. On the other hand, potential/time treatment of ruthenium substrates acts detrimentally on the stability of related oxide films, but makes the kinetics of the oxide film charging/discharging reaction more reversible. Total capacitance values of oxide films presented per gram of electrodeposited ruthenium are found to be almost independent of ruthenium loading, and slightly increased by the potential/time treatment performed. This all points to the fact that an increase in the ruthenium loading and potential/time treatment of ruthenium substrates results primarily in beneficial changes in the morphology of related oxide films. The magnitudes of the total capacitances per gram of electroplated ruthenium, however, remain strongly determined by the method of preparation of ruthenium substrates, and cannot be significantly changed by either an increase in the ruthenium loading or by the potential/time treatment of the ruthenium substrates.

The functional molecules are often indispensable in the morphology-control synthesis through preferential adsorption on specific crystal facets, or controlling certain crystal growth directions. In this review, the recent progress in morphology-control synthesis of noble-metal nanocrystals assisted by amino-based functional molecules for electrocatalytic applications are focused on. Although a mass of noble-metal nanocrystals with different morphologies have been reported, few review studies have been published related to amino-based molecules assisted control strategy. A full understanding for the key roles of amino-based molecules in the morphology-control synthesis is still necessary. As a result, the explicit roles and mechanisms of various types of amino-based molecules, including amino-based small molecules and amino-based polymers, in morphology-control of noble-metal nanocrystals are summarized and discussed in detail. Also presented in this progress are unique electrocatalytic properties of various shaped noble-metal nanocrystals. Particularly, the optimization of electrocatalytic selectivity induced by specific amino-based functional molecules (e.g., polyallylamine and polyethyleneimine) is highlighted. At the end, some critical prospects, and challenges in terms of amino-based molecules-controlled synthesis and electrocatalytic applications are proposed.									19	0	0	0	2	0	19			1613-6810	1613-6829		WOS:000627639500001	33709573

Profited from the biomimetic inorganic structure, MoS2 has been proven to be a promising catalyst for electrocatalytic nitrogen reduction reaction (ENRR). However, it suffers from deficient active sites and sluggish kinetics. Herein, a novel ENRR electrocatalyst was synthesized via an interfacial engineering strategy, in which the single-layered 1 T-MoS2 with high density of active sites (S vacancies) is uniformly grown on the supporting MoO3 matrix (denoted as SV-1 T-MoS2@MoO3). Benefiting from the functional S vacancies, well-designed structure and the comparative advantages of metallic 1 T-MoS2 phase, the as-synthesized SV-1 T-MoS2@MoO3 exhibits outstanding electrocatalytic performance with highest NH3 yield rate (116.1 mu g h(-1) mg(-1) ea p and optimized Faradaic efficiency (18.9 %), compared to other previously reported MoS2 -based counterparts in acid electrolyte. Density functional theory calculations revealed that the S vacancies can regulate the electronic structure of SV-1 T-MoS2@MoO3 and lead to the antibonding 2 pi* orbital of N-2 molecule moving close to the Fermi level, which greatly promoted the catalytic process towards a more favorable direction for ENRR. The design of SV-1 T-MoS2@MoO3 with hybrid structure in this work provides a reference and enlightenment for better envisagement of efficient nitrogen fixing catalysts.									19	2	0	0	0	0	20			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000621626700004

Single metal atom catalysts not only increase the number of active sites due to the maximum atom-utilization efficiency, but also enhance the intrinsic activity of each active site because of their unique geometric and electronic features. Furthermore, single metal atom catalysts provide a platform for photocatalysis research on the atomic level. This review discusses the unique characteristics, including geometric and electronic properties, of single metal atom catalysts, summarizes their synthesis strategies, and reviews their most recent development in photocatalysis. Finally, the challenges of single metal catalysts for both fundamental research and practical application are highlighted.									101	11	0	0	5	0	103			2366-9608			WOS:000485927700020

Several anodic and corresponding cathodic voltammetric peaks are observed during electrode treatment. The most negative anodic peaks are assigned to Fe(0)-> Fe(II) and Fe(II)-> Fe(III) reactions and subsequent layer reconstruction and/or transformation. Immediately after passivity region the transpassive iron dissolution, including ferrate(VI) formation together with an oxygen evolution occurs and the current peaks are visible for all electrodes used. This peak is the best developed for Fe electrode. In the case of the FeC electrode, only current shoulder is visible. With increasing temperature the visibility of this peak is getting better for all three electrodes. For all systems linear dependences of the current density on square root of the polarization rate at low polarization rates were found indicating that the electrode reaction kinetic is controlled by the mass transport under the semi-infinitive linear diffusion conditions. At higher scan rates current densities decrease indicating that a chemical step becomes rate determining at high polarization rates. Impedance data confirm the physical model of the polarized surface based on the concept of two, inner and outer surface sublayers. For all three electrodes resistances of inner and outer layers decrease with increasing applied potential. With increasing temperature the resistance of inner and outer layer decreases. The capacities of both layers increase with increasing potential, i.e. layers are getting thinner and/or more disintegrated.									10	0	0	0	1	0	10			1452-3981			WOS:000323546100024

The Magneli phase TinO2n-1 (4 <= n <= 10) has attracted much attention as a promising carbon-free support for electrocatalysts due to its high electrical conductivity and favorable electrochemical stability. Herein, we report the synthesis of a specific crystal-plane coupling heterostructure between Au(111) nanoparticles (NPs) and Ti6O11 by photoreduction. Benefitting from the modification of the electronic structure and synergistic effects of the heterostructure, the electron density around Au atoms is enhanced, and the Gibbs free energy of hydrogen absorption (Delta G(H*)) was dramatically optimized to facilitate the HER process. The best electrocatalyst Au(111)@Ti6O11-50 exhibits a lower overpotential of 49 mV at a current density of -10 mA cm(-2) and a Tafel slope of 39 mV dec(-1) in 0.5 M H2SO4, and shows long-term electrochemical stability over 30 h. Au(111)@Ti6O11-50 shows a mass activity of 9.25 A mg(Au)(-1), which is about 18 times higher than that of commercial Pt/C (0.51 A mg(Pt)(-1)). Meanwhile, the density functional theory (DFT) calculations suggest that the Delta G(H*) of Au(111)@Ti6O11 is -0.098 eV, which is comparable to that of Pt (-0.09 eV). This work would be a powerful guide for the realization of efficient utilization of noble metals in catalysis.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000760408200001	35201244

Experiments were carried out with tip-substrate voltammetry where the faradaic current flowing to the tip is recorded while cycling the potential of the substrate, and with tip-substrate chronoamperometry where the faradaic tip current is recorded against time following the application of a potential step to the substrate. The tip current was made pH sensitive by holding the tip potential in a region where a pH dependent reaction occurs. Hydrogen evolution was used to probe pH decreases, oxygen evolution was used for the detection of pH increases and Pt oxide formation was used to detect both pH increases and decreases. The results showed that oxide formation occurs in two stages, each involving the transfer of electrons and the release of protons into the solution. During the first stage the release of H+ precedes the transfer of electrons, while in the second stage H+ release and electron transfer proceed simultaneously. Results are analysed in terms of the formation of PtOH during stage 1 and PtO during stage 2. However stage 2 behaves differently under slow potential changes and the release of protons lags behind the transfer of electrons. This is interpreted as the result of a place-exchange mechanism from PtOH to HOPt prior to stage 2, followed by the oxidation of HOPt to OPt during stage 2. Similarly, oxide reduction was found to occur in two stages, each involving the transfer of electrons and the consumption of protons. During the first stage, the consumption of H+ precedes the transfer of electrons. The results suggest that during the transfer of electrons, protons diffuse from the outer layer of the oxide (OPt) into the inner layer to form HOPt. For the second stage results are analysed in terms of a place exchange mechanism from HOPt to PtOH running in parallel with the consumption of H+, followed by a surface reduction from PtOH2+ to Pt metal.

Thermogravimetric-Fourier transform infrared (TG-FTIR) was used to study the overall evolution behaviors of volatile from cotton pyrolysis as a reference to simulation results. In non-isothermal simulations, volatile was remained inside the simulation unit during the entire process, while in isothermal simulations a portion of volatile was removed from the simulation unit before starting next simulation at a higher temperature. Results showed that although the non-isothermal simulation method can predict a TG curve similar to the one obtained from the experiment and can reveal the initial evolution behaviors of the volatile, but the atomic contents of chars were unpractical. In isothermal simulations, 100, 80, 60 and 30 % volatile removal ratios (VRR) were employed to resemble the different extent of secondary reactions that volatiles undergo in practical pyrolysis. It was found that contents of aldehydes and C-H were mostly influenced by VRR; and simulations with higher VRR produced chars with lower O and H contents, being close to the practical chars. Simulations with 80, 100 % of VRR had a higher probability to match the reality.									12	1	0	0	0	0	13			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000623319400001

Giardia, a microaerophilic protozoan parasite has to build up mechanisms to protect themselves against oxidative stress within the human gut (oxygen concentration 60 mu M) to establish its pathogenesis. G. lamblia is devoid of the conventional mechanisms of the oxidative stress management system, including superoxide dismutase, catalase, peroxidase, and glutathione cycling, which are present in most eukaryotes. NADH oxidase is a major component of the electron transport chain of G. lamblia, which in concurrence with disulfide reductase, protects oxygen-labile proteins such as pyruvate: ferredoxin oxidoreductase against oxidative stress by sustaining a reduced intracellular environment It also contains the arginine dihydrolase pathway, which occurs in a number of anaerobic prokaryotes, includes substrate level phosphorylation and adequately active to make a major contribution to ATP production.To study differential gene expression under three types of oxidative stress, a Giardia genomic DNA array was constructed and hybridized with labeled cDNA of cells with or without stress. The transcriptomic data has been analyzed and further validated using real time PCR. We identified that out of 9216 genes represented on the array, more than 200 genes encoded proteins with functions in metabolism, oxidative stress management, signaling, reproduction and cell division, programmed cell death and cytoskeleton. We recognized genes modulated by at least >= 2 fold at a significant time point in response to oxidative stress.The study has highlighted the genes that are differentially expressed during the three experimental conditions which regulate the stress management pathway differently to achieve redox homeostasis. Identification of some unique genes in oxidative stress regulation may help in new drug designing for this common enteric parasite prone to drug resistance. Additionally, these data suggest the major role of this early divergent ancient eukaryote in anaerobic to aerobic organism evolution. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

J	Chang, Zhong-Jie; Chen, Ying; Du, Qi-Yan								[Cloning of hemoglobin alpha-chain cDNA sequences from five fishes in cypriniformes].								Yi chuan xue bao = Acta genetica Sinica				30	6			528	32						2003-Jun	2003	Oxygen content in water is one of the limit factors to the fish growing. The tolerance of fish to low oxygen content depends on the affinity of hemoglobin to oxygen. The tempt of transgenic fish study is to transfer hemoglobin gene from the fish that tolerates to low oxygen content in water to the fish sensitive to low oxygen condition. Therefore, using hemoglobin gene to breed new varieties may become a main trend in the near future. To explore the underline mechanisms for the variation of hemoglobin property, we have cloned hemoglobin-alpha-chain from five species of Cypriniformes fishes. A pair of consensus degenerate primes were designed basing on N-terminal and C-terminal conservative amino acid of alpha-chain. Using RT-PCR method, alpha-globin gene was amplified and cloned from total RNA which was extracted from blood of five fishes which are widely distribution in China (Cyprinus carpio, Ctenopharyngodon idellus, Carassius auratus, Misgurnus anguillicaudatus, Paramisgurnus dabryanus). Sequence comparison with the existing hemoglobin alpha-chain confirmed that these cDNA fragments were alpha-globin gene of five fishes. The accession numbers in GenBank are AF528156, AF528157, AF528197, AF528198, AF528199 respectively. The cDNA which coding amino acid are all 429 bp. Compared with the amino acid sequences of five fishes, it can be concluded that in five fishes the highest similarity of two fishes which are Paramisgurnus dabryanus and Misgurnus anguillicaudatus is 99.41%, whereas the lowest similarity of two fishes which are Ctenopharyngodon idellus and Paramisgurnus dabryanus is 83.92%. In addition, the sequence similarity and phylogenetic relationship were compared with Within-group method. The result shows that there is much consistent between similarity and phylogenetic relationships from morphological of those near relation species and much connection between similarity and environment of those distant relation species.									0	1	0	0	0	0	1			0379-4172			MEDLINE:12939797	12939797

Here, we report the discovery of a 16-kDa thioredoxin-related protein designated Cr-TRP16, from a "living fossil," the horseshoe crab (Carcinoscorpius rotundicauda). Cr-TRP16 contains an atypical WCPPC catalytic motif and possesses the classical thiodisulfide reductase activity, as indicated by the insulin reduction assay. Furthermore, Cr-TRP16 can function as an antioxidant and protect against DNA nicking by reactive oxygen species. Overexpression of Cr-TRP16 regulated the transcription of NF-kappa B-dependent genes probably by enhancing NF-kappa B DNA-binding activity, suggesting possible roles for Cr-TRP16 in modulating the NF-kappa B signaling pathway. In vivo, the antioxidant pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate suppressed the expression of NF-kappa B-regulated genes such as I kappa B and inducible nitric oxide synthase. This further supports the notion that oxidative stress is also a regulatory factor of the NF-kappa B signaling pathway, a phenomenon which has been entrenched for several hundred million years. Furthermore, we demonstrated that the 16-kDa thioredoxins are evolutionarily conserved from Caenorhabditis elegans to human. Interestingly, thioredoxin-like 6, a human homologue of Cr-TRP16, could also enhance NF-kappa B DNA-binding activity, suggesting that the regulatory role of the 16-kDa thioredoxins on NF-kappa B is well conserved through evolution.

Presence of D-glucose was important for the stabilization of the evolved copper octahedra and also for facilitating the reduction of the Cu(II) ions. The existence of glucose moieties on the surface as capping agent was confirmed by the FT-IR spectra while there was presence of excess oxygen atoms on the surface leading to the formation of a thin CuO layer at the octahedra surface, as confirmed by the XPS study, probably promoted by the capping glucose. Effect of NaOH concentration on the reaction and the formation of octahedra was also studied. The formation mechanism of obtained Cu2O octahedra has been discussed. These octahedra were then studied for their photocatalytic properties in degradation of organic dyes, rhodamine B and methyl orange. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

Rietveld refinements showed that the lattice parameters increased with the increase in Nb5+ content. SEM and TEM images of the product showed that the elements Nb, Mn and O were evenly distributed in the samples, which further confirmed the cubic rock-salt structure of the product. Electrochemical tests of the samples showed that the sample with x = 0.4 exhibited the best electrochemical performance (232 mAh/g in the first cycle and more than 175 mAh/g in 50 cycles, as well as relatively high discharge capacity at high discharge current density). The redox mechanism analysis of the experimental results indicated that there were two stages in charge process: one was the Mn3+/4+ oxidation reaction below 4.3 V, and the other was related to the oxidation of O2- to O- or the release of O-2, which improved the reversible capacity of the material. The structural evolution analysis of the samples showed that a spinel phase structure was present during the cycling process and the shift in the XRD peaks indicated that the sample with x = 0.4 exhibited the best structural stability. The electrochemical impedance spectroscopy analysis showed that the sample with x = 0.4 had the smallest R-ct. The results for the kinetics of lithium ion diffusion indicated that the sample with x = 0.4 had largest D-Li(+), which was consistent with the best electrochemical performance for this material, especially the rate capability.

Herein, we utilize the well-defined ab initio computations to build up the strong coupling systems between single atoms and transition metal borides (MBene) as the superior electrocatalysts for eNRR. This work addresses a series of transition metal atoms ranging from IVB to VIII subgroups in Mo vacancies of the MBene nanosheet (Mo2B2O2) and carries out a systematic screening of activities and selectivity on the eNRR process. The computational results indicate that Re and Os supported on the defective Mo2B2O2 layer possess a remarkable catalytic activity with relatively low barrier of the potential-determining step (PDS) of 0.29 and 0.32 eV, which are lower than that of the single Ru atom decorated on Mo2CO2 (0.46 eV). The implanted Re and Os atoms selectively promote the eNRR process and suppress the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) process in the presence of oxygen vacancies. Moreover, the number of d electrons and the horizontal periods in periodic table of the elements of single atoms are proved to be related to the first protonation step of eNRR and the crucial adsorbed species *NNH. Accordingly, the binary descriptor with respect to the number of d electrons and the period is proposed to establish the relationship between the intrinsic atomic properties and catalytic capacity. This work paves the way to the electrocatalytic atomic-level mechanism of novel MBene for the reduction of N-2 to NH3 at ambient conditions.									26	3	0	0	0	0	26			2574-0970			WOS:000583331600093

The absolute reaction rate constants for (OH)-O-center dot with three antiviral drugs were first reported through pulsed radiolysis experiments. Results found that (OH)-O-center dot reacted quickly with these substrates, with bimolecular reaction rate constants of 6.31 x 10(9), 5.13 x 10(9), and 7.05 x 10(9) M-1 s(-1) for 1-amantadine, 2-amantadine, and rimantadine, respectively. The photocatalytic deg-radation kinetics of substrates were followed pseudo-first-order kinetics according to Langmuir-Hinshelwood model in TiO2 suspensions, and the apparent rate constants were obtained as 0.076, 0.084, and 0.102 min(-1) for three antiviral drugs, respectively. Scavenger experiments revealed that (OH)-O-center dot was the major reactive species involved in antiviral drugs degradation. To probe the photocatalytic degradation mechanism, the fate of nitrogen elements and the change of total organic carbon were also examined, and the data showed that all three drugs could be completely mineralized into CO2, H2O, and inorganic ions (NO3- and NH4+) without generating any detectable products with enough degradation time. To further insight into the potential adverse effect of three antiviral drugs and their degradation products, the acute aquatic toxicity of degradation solutions were evaluated at three different trophic levels, and the toxicities first increased slightly and then decreased rapidly as the total organic carbon decreased.

J	Markl, G								Mullite-corundum-spinel-cordierite-plagioclase xenoliths in the Skaergaard Marginal Border Group: multi-stage interaction between metasediments and basaltic magma								CONTRIBUTIONS TO MINERALOGY AND PETROLOGY				149	2			196	215		10.1007/s00410-004-0644-5				APR 2005	2005	Metapelitic country rocks were contact- and pyro-metamorphosed by the Tertiary Skaergaard Intrusion, East Greenland. In an initial stage of heating, while they were probably still in place within the host rock contact aureole, they overstepped a range of equilibrium and disequilibrium melting reactions and produced both a granitic melt and very refractory spinel + cordierite + plagioclase +/- corundum residuals. Parts of these refractory rocks were then subjected to another melting event after being entrained as xenoliths into the Skaergaard Marginal Border Group, where they experienced a temperature of about 1,000 degrees C at a pressure of about 650 bars and at an oxygen fugacity about 0.2 - 0.5 log units below the FMQ buffer. Here, they underwent bulk melting, but did not mix with the Skaergaard magma, presumably because of the high viscosity contrast. The Al-rich melts crystallized to an assemblage of corundum + mullite + sillimanite + plagioclase + spinel + rutile +/- tridymite +/- cordierite and they reacted with the surrounding basalt producing a strongly cryptically zoned rim of plagioclase (An(55) close to the basalt to An(90) close to the Al-rich melt). The assemblage in the inner parts of the xenoliths provides textural evidence for disequilibrium growth due to slow diffusivities in the highly viscous, probably water-free Al-rich melt. Later interaction of lower temperature ferrobasaltic to granophyric melts with the xenoliths along their margins and along cracks led to consumption of corundum and mullite and to the stable assemblage of spinel + cordierite + plagioclase + quartz + K-feldspar + magnetite + ilmenite at about 800 degrees C.									18	1	1	0	0	0	19			0010-7999	1432-0967		WOS:000228206100005

By combining a global minimum structure search and first-principles calculations, a hitherto unknown 2D MoCN monolayer was found, which can be considered as a structure in which Mo atoms interact with the stable CN units through triple bonds. The resultant MoCN monolayer possesses superior thermodynamic, dynamic, thermal, and mechanical stabilities, as well as inherent metallicity. In particular, it can exhibit outstanding HER catalytic activity due to the presence of many active sites with near-zero Delta G(H*) values, whose density totals 1.80 x 10(15) sites per cm(2), even more than Pt. In addition, we also propose a series of other 2D monolayers containing stable CN units (i.e., MoC2N, MoCN2 and MoC2N2), all of which can uniformly show high stability and good HER catalytic activity. Applying strain can further effectively improve the activities of C-rich (MoC2N) and N-rich (MoCN2) monolayers, inducing considerably high HER catalytic performance. For the MoCN, MoC2N and MoCN2 monolayers, the most active sites are located at the Mo-C-N chain involved. All these fascinating findings can not only provide new excellent candidates but also new insights into the design of highly efficient and nonprecious HER electrocatalysts as an alternative to Pt in the near future.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000753056300001	35137760

Herein, we develop a novel ZnS/CdS/ZnO ternary heterostructure by the in-situ sulfuration of CdS/ZnO, which includes four contact interfaces: CdS-ZnS interface, ZnS-ZnO interface, CdS-ZnO interface and ZnS-CdS-ZnO ternary interface, forming three charge carrier-transfer modes (type-I, type-II and direct Z scheme) through five carrier-transfer pathways. As a result, the separation and transfer of photoexcited electron hole pairs are promoted significantly, resulting in a high hydrogen evolution rate of 44.70 mmol h(-1) g(-1), which is 2, 3.7 and 8 times higher than those of binary heterostructures, CdS/ZnO, CdS/ZnS and ZnS/ZnO, respectively, and 26.5, 280 and 298 times higher than those of single CdS, ZnO and ZnS, respectively. As a counterpart ternary heterostructure, CdS/ZnS/ZnO contains only two interfaces: CdS-ZnS interface and ZnS-ZnO interface, which form two charge carrier-transfer modes (type-I and type-II) through two carrier-transfer pathways, leading to its much lower hydrogen evolution rate (27.25 mmol h(-1) g(-1)) than ZnS/CdS/ZnO ternary heterostructure. This work is relevant for understanding the charge-transfer pathways between multi-interfaces in multicomponent heterojunctions.									31	3	0	0	5	0	32			0378-7753	1873-2755		WOS:000427217200031		
J	Roetzler, Jochen; Hagen, Bettina; Hoernes, Stephan								Geothermometry of the ultrahigh-temperature Saxon granulites revisited. Part I: New evidence from key mineral assemblages and reaction textures								EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF MINERALOGY				20	6			1097	1115		10.1127/0935-1221/2008/0020-1857				NOV-DEC 2008	2008	The high-pressure (HP) granulite metamorphism in Variscan central Europe has recently been questioned to be ultrahigh temperature (UHT) because ternary feldspars from granulites in the Moldanubian region resembling those considered elsewhere as metamorphic minerals were re-interpreted as relic protolith minerals. Fe-Mg exchange reactions, although indicating similar temperatures as the ternary feldspars, have been discarded as unreliable for determining UHT conditions. Pseudosection modelling of the re-interpreted mineral assemblages has suggested metamorphism at temperatures clearly below those derived in earlier work. To re-examine the meta morphism of the Saxon granulites, we have studied key mineral assemblages and reaction textures, some of which have not yet been introduced into the present debate. The investigated felsic granulites display a close textural association of ternary feldspar with garnet and kyanite, including mutual inclusion relationships, suggesting that these minerals have equilibrated at the rnetamorphic peak. The UHT-HP conditions of this assemblage are close to P-T data calculated from the plagioclase-bearing inclusion assemblage in garnet and the peak assemblage of a garnet-clinopyroxene granulite. Reaction textures in a feldspathic prismatine granulite showing a transition from garnet-kyanite-corundum to garnet-corundum-sapphirine-sillimanite as well as subsequent overprinting during prismatine-forming H2O-deficient albite melting are evidence for continuous UHT conditions during decompression. These assemblages require temperatures above the Mg-staurolite stability, the invariant point [Crd] in the silica-undersaturated FMAS system, and the dravite stability, respectively. Continuous UHT conditions after a strong decrease in pressure emerge equally from multi-equilibrium calculations for a garnet-two-pyroxene granulite, where garnet has re-equilibrated with a two-pyroxene-plagioclase-quartz assemblage in the matrix and the corona assemblage orthopyroxene-plagioclase-quartz. Our findings confirm the earlier proposed UHT-HP decompression path for the Saxon granulites and underpin the metamorphic origin of ternary feldspar. Oxygen-isotope thermometry data for the same mineral assemblages presented in a companion paper agree with the results of chemical equilibrium thermometry and provide an independent confirmation for the UHT metamorphism.

It catalyzes the formation of the superoxide anion (O-2(center dot-)), a type of ROS. In recent years, various studies had shown that members of the plant rboh gene family were involved in plant growth and developmental processes as well as in biotic and abiotic stress responses, but little is known about its functional role in upland cotton. Results In the present study, 26 putative Ghrboh genes were identified and characterized. They were phylogenetically classified into six subfamilies and distributed at different densities across 18 of the 26 chromosomes or scaffolds. Their exon-intron structures, conserved domains, synteny and collinearity, gene family evolution, regulation mediated by cis-acting elements and microRNAs (miRNAs) were predicted and analyzed. Additionally, expression profiles of Ghrboh gene family were analyzed in different tissues/organs and at different developmental stages and under different abiotic stresses, using RNA-Seq data and real-time PCR. These profiling studies indicated that the Ghrboh genes exhibited temporal and spatial specificity with respect to expression, and might play important roles in cotton development and in stress tolerance through modulating NOX-dependent ROS induction and other signaling pathways. Conclusions This comprehensive analysis of the characteristics of the Ghrboh gene family determined features such as sequence, synteny and collinearity, phylogenetic and evolutionary relationship, expression patterns, and cis-element- and miRNA-mediated regulation of gene expression. Our results will provide valuable information to help with further gene cloning, evolutionary analysis, and biological function analysis of cotton rbohs.									9	1	0	0	7	0	11			1471-2164			WOS:000513951200003	31996127

The thermoluminescence bands arising from the S(2)Q(B)(-) (B band) and S(2)Q(A)(-) (Q band) charge recombination disappeared with increasing UV-B irradiation time. In contrast, the C band at 50 degrees C, arising from the recombination of Q(A)(-) with an accessory donor of Photosystem II, was transiently enhanced by the UV-B irradiation. The efficiency of DCMU to block Q(A) to Q(B) electron transfer decreased after irradiation as detected by the incomplete suppression of the B band by DCMU. The flash-induced oscillatory pattern of the B band was modified in the UV-B irradiated samples, indicating a decrease in the number of centers with reduced Q(B). Based on the results of this study, W-B irradiation is suggested to damage both the donor and acceptor sides of Photosystem II, The damage of the water-oxidizing complex does not affect a specific S-state transition. Instead, charge stabilization is enhanced on an accessory donor. The acceptor-side modifications decrease the affinity of DCMU binding. This effect is assumed to reflect a structural change in the Q(B)/DCMU binding site. The preferential loss of dark stable Q(B)(-) may be related to the same structural change or could be caused by the specific destruction of reduced quinones by the W-B light.									46	0	0	0	42	0	46			0166-8595	1573-5079		WOS:A1993MX41700029	24318003

The synthesis methods, surface characterizations, theoretical research methods, and hardware over the last decade generated opportunities for progress in the surface science of this photocatalyst. Very recently, attention was paid to the design of photocatalysts at the nanoscale level by adjusting the types of exposed surfaces and their ratio, the composition and the surface structure of nanoparticles, and that of individual surfaces. The current theoretical methods provide highly detailed designs that can be embodied experimentally. The present review article describes the progress in the surface science of TiO2 and TiO2-based photocatalysts obtained over the last three years. Such aspects including the properties of macro- and nano-scale surfaces, noble-metal-loaded surfaces, doping with Mg and S, intrinsic defects (oxygen vacancies), adsorption, and photoreactions are considered.

They exhibit inferior HER activity in alkaline media, however, owing to the sluggish water dissociation kinetics. Herein, in-plane MoS2/Co9S8 heterostructures are in situ grown on three-dimensional carbon network substrates with interconnected hierarchical pores by one-step pyrolysis to enhance the alkaline HER activity. The experiment results reveal that the HER kinetics of MoS2 is accelerated after the construction of heterostructures. The synthesized MoS2/Co9S8 heterostructures anchored on a three-dimensional interconnected hierarchical pore carbon network exhibit a lower overpotential of 177 mV than MoS2 (252 mV) at 10 mA cm(-2) for the HER in 1 M KOH. The enhanced catalytic performance is mainly attributed to the accelerated water dissociation kinetics on the interface of MoS2 and Co9S8. In combination with DFT calculations, it is revealed that assembling the interface construction synergistically favors the chemisorption of protons and the cleavage of the O-H bonds of the H2O molecule, thus accelerating the kinetics of the HER. Moreover, the three-dimensional interconnected hierarchical pore carbon (3DC) network structure is beneficial for the circulation of the electrolyte and H-2 spillover. This study demonstrates the present strategy as a facile route for fabricating efficient HER catalysts.									27	1	0	0	0	0	27			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000503282100039	31686061

Herein, a binder-free NiCoP-carbon nanocomposite (denoted as NiCoP-C(TPA)) film with a unique nanostructure was fabricated on nickel foam (NF) for the first time by the deposition of a terephthalic acid induced NiCo bimetallic compound precursor film on NF via hydrothermal synthesis, followed by calcination in Ar atmosphere and phosphorization treatment with NaH2PO2. In the obtained NiCoP-C(TPA) electrocatalyst, the bimetallic phosphide nanoparticles were well combined with the graphitic carbon. It was found that the bimetallic NiCo alloy was formed in the carbonization process, which affected the performance of the final catalyst. As a result, the NiCoP-C(TPA) electrocatalyst had a much higher activity than the monometallic phosphides of NiP-C(TPA)/NF and CoP-C(TPA)/NF, and the NiCoP-C(TPA)/NF electrode exhibited an overpotential as low as 78 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) with a small Tafel slope of 73.4 mV dec(-1), a faradaic efficiency of similar to 94%, and long-term stability at high current densities in an alkaline electrolyte. Meanwhile, the NiCoP-C(TPA)/NF electrode also exhibited superior HER performance in an acidic electrolyte with an overpotential of 94 mV@10 mA cm(-2), a Tafel slope of 81.1 mV dec(-1), and long-term stability, although in a neutral electrolyte, a relatively high overpotential of 248 mV@10 mA cm(-2) with a high Tafel slope of 112.5 mV dec(-1) was obtained. It is expected to provide a novel synthetic method by using an organic solid acid to obtain high-performance bimetallic phosphide based electrocatalysts with special nanostructure for HER in the water splitting process.									13	0	0	0	0	0	13			2044-4753	2044-4761		WOS:000483698400015

Herein, a general strategy is introduced to fabricate a new type of electrocatalysts based on bimetallic core@shell structure formed on nitrogen-doped nanoporous carbon for electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Accordingly, a nickel metal organic framework, Ni-MOF, synthesized by using benzene-1,3,5-tricarboxylic acid (H3BTC) as the carbon source and 2-methyl-imidazole as the carbon and nitrogen source, is employed, and the nickel/nitrogen-doped nanoporous carbon composite, Ni/NNPC system, is synthesized by the direct carbonization of Ni-MOF system, i.e. annealing the system in argon atmosphere without using any carbon precursor additive. Then, the outer layers of nickel in Ni/NNPC system are replaced by Pt via galvanic reaction to synthesize the nanostructured system, Ni metal core@Pt thin layer shell, Ni@Pt/NNPC. The step-by-step synthesis of the system and formation of core@shell was supported by several surface analysis techniques. The fabricated materials were transferred onto a glassy carbon (GC) electrode and studied for the HER. The electrochemical results revealed a large electrocatalytic activity for the GCE/Ni@Pt/NNPC system toward the HER in both alkaline and acidic media, compared with GCE, GCE/Ni-MOF and GCE/Ni/NNPC. Tafel slopes of 43.78 and 46.73 mV dec(-1), and overpotentials of -33.80 and -76.32 mV (vs RHE) at 20 mA cm(-2) (eta(20)) were observed on GCE/Ni@Pt/NNPC electrode in the alkaline and acidic media, under the same conditions, respectively. The observed activity is attributed to (i) the increased electrochemically active surface area, (ii) the cooperative action or synergistic effect between the Pt thin layer shell and the Ni metal core as well as between the Ni@Pt nanoparticles and the NNPC platform, and (iii) effective pore structures of the Ni@Pt/NNPC system.

Building step-scheme (S-scheme) heterojunction by coupling with other semiconductors especially those own oxygen vacancies (OVs) can further upgrade the photocatalytic performance of C3N5-based photocatalysts. Herein, a novel S-scheme heterojunction of OVs mediated Bi2MoO6/C(3)N(5 )was fabricated by in-situ growing Bi2MoO6 nanoparticles with OVs on C3N5 nanosheets. Benefiting from the efficient separation and transfer of high energetic charge carriers by S-scheme charge migration, enriched structural defects, as well as the close contact by the in-situ growth, the heterojunction exhibited superior visible-light photocatalytic performance toward the removal of tetracycline (TC) and Cr(VI) than C3N5, Bi2MoO6, and their mechanical mixture under visible light. The TC degradation routes and the bio-toxicity evolution of TC were explored. Moreover, the photocatalytic mechanism for TC decomposition and Cr(VI) reduction over Bi2MoO6/C3N5 with OVs were elucidated. This work presents a newfangled vision for designing promising C3N5-based S-scheme heterojunction photocatalysts for pollution control. (C) 2022 Elsevier Inc.

J	Ghimpu, Mihaela								COVID-19 Infection - the Possibility to Involve Oxygen as Immunogen in the ARDS Determinism (Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome).								Maedica				16	3			507	515		10.26574/maedica.2020.16.3.507				2021-Sep	2021	Since its onset, the new coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 has manifested multiple paradoxes related to both complications of the infection and treatment resistance. The experiences in therapy started from the use of neutralizing monoclonal antibodies and anti-cytokine therapy (anti IL-6, anti-TNF-alpha and CCR5) up to experiments of immunomodulation with glucocorticoids and proposal of very powerful immunomodulatory drugs like cyclophosphamide in optimized diagrams in order to induce the depression of the immune hyperergic reaction with the maintenance of TH and TC lymphocyte resistance to keep the anti-viral activity in the absence of an etiological treatment. In this context, also the second major immunologic mechanism could function: the molecular mimicry - cross-reactivity between viral epitopes and various antigenic determinants from the body, other than the tissue structures of the respiratory system. In a similar manner, in the past, genital staphylococcal infections among women wearing tampons, sometimes generated a toxic-septic shock with an unexpected evolution to death. It is also about an atypical cytokine storm, generated by the staphylococcal toxins (super-antigenic) but probably, the aggressiveness was also generated by the cross reactivity with chemical antigens from the cotton fibers, because this disorder generally appeared among women in the menstrual period, sometimes the local genital infection being minor. Moreover, with the lapse of time, the reaction of shock no longer appeared, probable through the increase of immunologic tolerance to cotton fibers. In a similar manner, in COVID-19 a reaction of hyper-sensitivity to a gaseous antigen could overlap, considering the decrease of tolerance at the invasive administration of oxygen (the contact with BALT - the lymphatic system associated to the bronchia, where the resident macrophage is the siderophage) and partial maintenance at the non-invasive administration through mask or extracorporeal, which induces the first contact with the lymphatic elements associated to the oropharyngeal cavity or blood, where the siderophage can no longer be observed. In this context, some adult patients with COVID-19 could manifest an immunologic genetic defect of TS at BALT level, as women with staphylococcal toxic-septic shock had a local defect at the VALT level (lymphatic tissue associated with the genital tract). In children, the syndrome is rare and more multisystem, which rather suggests the breaking of central tolerance through the lack of intra-thymus or intra-medullary deletion of the auto-reactive clones of (Th TC), while among adults the defect seems to be more peripheral, local, with the involvement of TS and resident macrophages (siderophages). This could explain not only the higher level of severity in elder patients and those with cardiac disorders but also the rarity of the pathology in patients aged under nine years.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1841-9038			MEDLINE:34925610	34925610

Pedraza, Fernando/0000-0002-9388-0822			Novel concept of functional oxide coatings providing enhanced oxidation resistance to Ni-based superalloys								MATERIALS RESEARCH BULLETIN				49				384	387		10.1016/j.materresbull.2013.09.017				JAN 2014	2014	Aluminide-coated Ni-based superalloys are prone to microstructural instabilities during long-term exposure at high temperature with the growth of a secondary reaction zone (SRZ) detrimental from a mechanical viewpoint. This has been since overcome by the use of thermodynamically stable coatings (gamma-Ni/gamma'-Ni3Al). However, additions of Pt and Hf are required to provide the formation of an exclusive alpha-Al2O3 scale and improved oxidation resistance in cyclic and isothermal regimes. The present work proposes a new coating system that relies on the use of a superficial nanostructured functional oxide providing the establishment of a stable alumina while avoiding SRZ formation. Tailored oxygen-defective and multi-cracked coatings were designed for 2nd generation Ni-based superalloys and generated by electrosynthesis using a water-based solution. Cyclic oxidation tests were carried out at 1100 degrees C in air and the oxidation properties and the microstructural stability of the coating system were demonstrated. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Zhao, Yiying; Deng, Ning; Fan, Zhiheng; Hu, Zhong-Ting; Fan, Lili; Zhou, Jizhi; Huang, Xin								On-site H2O2 electro-generation process combined with ultraviolet: A promising approach for odorous compounds purification in drinking water system								CHEMICAL ENGINEERING JOURNAL				430						132829	10.1016/j.cej.2021.132829		OCT 2021		FEB 15 2022	2022	The on-site generation of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) attracts much attention for advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) in water treatment. In this work, we reported a novel on-site H2O2 generation reactor combined with ultraviolet (UV) for taste and odor (T&O) compounds removal in drinking water purification systems. The reactor is equipped with a gas diffusion electrode (GDE) accompanied by a proton-conducting solid electrolyte. In this reactor, GDE is used to improve the oxygen transfer efficiency. The porous solid electrolyte is selected for the proton and electron conduction instead of an electrolyte solution, which is crucial for producing pure H2O2 solution. The production rate and concentration of H2O2 can be controlled through adjusting the applied current efficiency and the flow rate of deionized water in a solid chamber. Meanwhile, this system exhibits long-term stability during a continuous operation for 96 h. For the application of the system, the single-cell was assembled into cell stacks, which improved the H2O2 concentration from 780.9 to 2301.3 mg.L-1, along with the energy consumption reduced from 23.81 to 6.67 kWh.kg(-1) under the applied current density of 30 mA.cm(-2). To evaluate the water purification performance of this system, the oxidation degradation of 2,4,6-trichlomanisoles (TCA) was conducted using the on-site H2O2 generation process under both static and dynamic flow conditions combined with UV light. The degradation rate of TCA was >95% with its initial concentration of 1 mu g.L-1 under the hydraulic retention time from 10 to 40 min(-1) and H2O2 dosage from 10 to 100 mg.L-1. Meanwhile, almost no residual H2O2 was detected after the degradation process. This study proposed a promising device for drinking water purification.									7	0	0	0	0	0	7			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000724574400004

To minimize this dependency, Ir-oxides with enhanced mass-specific surface areas and OER-activities are progressively being developed, but often suffer from a poorly understood deactivation under operating conditions. To understand this activity loss, in this study we used a modified Adams' fusion method to produce an Ir-oxide with a surface area of approximate to 350 m(2) g(-1) that consists of nano-disks with their surface partially covered by a layer of Ir(OOH). In order to investigate the effect of this surface oxidation state on the catalyst's reactivity and stability, a fraction of this as-synthetized sample was submitted to a second heat-treatment in air to further oxidize its surface (i.e., yielding IrO2 with approximate to 250 m(2) g(-1)). While electrochemical characterization through rotating disk electrode voltammetry unveiled that the as-synthesized catalyst features a approximate to 2-fold larger surface-specific OER-activity than its heat-treated derivative, it also undergoes a greater loss of such activity in the course of an accelerated stress test (AST) that mimics electrolyzer startup/shutdown (approximate to 45 vs. approximate to 30% OER-current decrease for the as-synthetized sample vs. its heat-treated derivative, respectively). Since ex situ analyses (e.g., through X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy) were not sufficient to explain this difference in stability, the operando changes in the samples' morphology and chemical composition were assessed using a recently developed apparatus that combines small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) and X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS). While the XAS measurements demonstrated the compositional stability of both catalysts (i.e., oxidation state and local geometric structure), SAXS showed that the as-synthetized catalyst is made of two-dimensionally agglomerated disks that become thinner and wider in the course of the AST, whereas the heat-treated sample is composed of morphologically stable, sintered particles in the form of rough and porous agglomerates. Considering the complementary information provided by these operando and ex situ techniques, it was then possible to quantify the contributions of Ir-dissolution, surface area loss and changes in the surface oxidation state to the destabilization of both catalysts.									58	0	0	0	2	0	57			1754-5692	1754-5706		WOS:000489897600006

However, the reported catalytic activity of Ni3S2 is still relatively low. N-doped graphene coated N-doped Ni3S2 nanocubes (N-Ni3S2 @NG) structure was proposed, which is an effective way to improve the catalytic activity of Ni3S2 . Thanks to the unique structural design and functional integration, the OER and HER in alkaline medium provide 238 mV and 100 mV over potential respectively at 10 mA cm(-2), and 1.53 V ultra-low operating voltage for overall water splitting. In addition, its super stable catalytic activity is also impressive, and the performance loss is negligible after 70 h durability test. These experimental data and analysis show that, the outstanding catalytic activity of N-Ni3S2 @NG is due to its abundant active centers and good electron transport properties. More broadly, this combination of bifunctional concept and nanoscale stereoscopic design is unique and advantageous, especially suitable for the development of highly active and durable electrocatalysts for energy conversion reactions.

A triple-layered PPy@NiCo LDH/FeCo2O4 hybrid with a tri-metal hybrid nanowire and conductive PPy coating layer is fabricated via a one-step hydrothermal reaction and in situ polymerization. NiCo LDH/FeCo2O4 nanowire arrays with a layered crystalline structure are synthesized via an in situ dissolution-growth method, where the partially etched nickel foam substrate subsequently acts as the Ni source. The NiCo LDH/FeCo2O4 nanowire arrays together with the ultrathin PPy coating layer can form bi-continuous conductive networks, numerous crystalline edges and structural interfaces to increase the electron transfer rate and the active/adsorption sites, which can further promote the energy storage and electrocatalytic activity. The bi-functional PPy@NiFeCo/NF-4 electrode exhibits a high areal capacitance (9.24 F cm(-2) at 5 mA cm(-2)) and excellent rate capability (90.5% retention from 5 to 30 mA cm(-2)) as a supercapacitor and achieves a small overpotential (244 mV at 50 mA cm(-2)) and Tafel slope (64.39 mV dec(-1)) as an electrocatalytic OER electrode.									6	0	0	0	1	0	6				1466-8033		WOS:000631238900008

Composition,structure and age of identified minerals in the magmatic-hydrothermal system were used to discuss the controlling factors of Fe enrichment in ore-forming process,and establish the metallogenetic model of such iron deposits. Results showed that there are two types of magma evolution processes in this area,forming two individual metallogenic systems. In the hornblende diorite-diorite metallogenic system,high-Mg diorite and Fe-rich ore-forming fluid were formed by fractional crystallization of magnesium-rich amphibole at high oxygen fugacity condition. But in diorite-monzonite metallogenic system,2.5 Ga iron-rich metamorphic basement was assimilated into the magma,and provided countable mineralization material. Reaction between oxidized hydrothermal fluids and Ca-rich carbonate would form Fe-rich skarn, such as andradite,consuming large amounts of Fe so that the fulids would be Fe poor and be unfavorable in Fe mineralization. When ore-forming fluids reacted with Mg-rich carbonate,Fe-poor skarn,such as diopside,would not significant lower Fe in fluids. Such fluids would remain Fe-rich and form iron deposits.			为了探讨邯邢地区夕卡岩型铁矿的成因,本次研究运用成因矿物学方法,通过对岩浆-热液成矿系统中标识性矿物的成分、结构、年龄等特征的系统解析,研究了成矿过程中Fe质富集的规律及其影响因素,建立了邯邢式铁矿的成矿过程模型。结果显示,本区的岩浆存在两种演化方式,形成两个相对独立的成矿系统。在角闪闪长岩-闪长岩成矿系统中,基性岩浆主要通过高氧逸度条件下富镁角闪石的结晶分异作用形成高镁闪长岩和富铁的成矿流体;在闪长岩-二长岩成矿系统中,2.5Ga的富铁变质基底被同化进入岩浆系统,提供了重要的成矿物质。在高氧逸度的成矿流体交代富Ca的碳酸盐围岩形成以钙铁榴石为代表的夕卡岩,消耗了大量的Fe质,不利于成矿;交代富Mg的碳酸盐围岩形成以透辉石为代表的夕卡岩,消耗Fe质较少,有利于成矿。						0	5	0	0	0	0	5			1007-2802			CSCD:6227319

The electrode was characterized by SEM, XRD, XPS, and electrochemical characterizations including linear-sweep voltammetry (LSV), cyclic voltammetry (CV) and chronopotentiometry (CP) techniques. It was found that Pd doping could effectively change the surface morphology and lattice parameters of the metal oxide electrode. Pd can facilitate the entry of more Sb into SnO2 crystals and promote the reduction of Sb from the +5 to the +3 state. The interaction of these metals raised the oxygen evolution potential (OEP) and electrochemical surface area of the electrode, in addition to reducing the degradation potential and increasing the degradation current of NiEDTA. When the molar ratio of Pd: Sn was 2.5%, the electrode could simultaneously degrade 87.5% of NiEDTA and recycle 17.9% of elemental Ni on the cathode within 120 min. At the same time, with Pd doping, the lifetime of the electrode was increased more than 40 times, demonstrating good potential for application in industry. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

In general, hypoxia can induce apoptosis. In order to shed lights into the molecular mechanism of the plateau zokor adaptation to the hypoxic environment, the sequences of Pidd, Fas, Bax, Puma, Apaf-1, Scotin, Perp, Igfbp3 and Bcl-2 were analyzed by MEGA 7.0, PAML4.8 program and Ancestor program. In addition, the expression levels of these genes were determined with real-time PCR in the lung tissues of zokors inhabiting at different altitudes (3 300 m and 2 260 m) and compared with the SD rats in this study. The sequences of the apoptotic target genes in plateau zokors were highly homologous those of Nannospalax galili (Table 2 and Table 3). PIDD (Fig. 2), PUMA (Fig. 3), Apaf-1 (Fig. 4), IGFBP3 (Fig. 5) and BCL-2 (Fig. 6) in plateau zokor and Nannospalax galili showed convergent sites in their functional domains. The SIFT test showed that, compared to other species, 78, 853, 157, 320 and 285 variation sites of plateau zokor and Nannospalax galili had effects on the function of p53, PIDD, PUMA, Apaf-1 and IGFBP3, respectively (Table 5). At the high altitude (3 300 m), the expression levels of proapoptotic genes Pidd, Bax and Puma were significantly decreased, while the expression level of antiapoptotic gene Bcl-2 was significantly increased; instead, the expression levels of proapoptotic and antiapoptotic genes showed no significant difference in SD rats. The expression levels of apoptotic genes in plateau zokor were higher than in the SD rats (Fig. 7, 8). At the high altitude (3 300 m), the ratio of Bcl-2/Bax expression was significantly increased in plateau zokor, whereas that of the SD rat was not (Fig. 9). The results above suggested that site variation of p53 in plateau zokor resulted in different expression patterns of p53 targeted apoptotic genes from those in SD rat: the expression levels of proapoptotic genes Pidd, Bax, Puma and Apaf-1 were decreased, while the expression level of antiapoptotic gene Bcl-2 was increased, so as to inhibit apoptosis under hypoxic environment. Under the long-term hypoxia conditions, the p53 targeted proteins PIDD, PUMA, Apaf-1 and IGFBP3 had significant variation sites, which might alter their ability to combine with their functional complexes and inhibit apoptosis. Therefore, over the long-term hypoxia adaptation, the apoptotic genes of plateau zokor underwent structural variation, leading to change in the expression levels of these genes, and thereby inhibited apoptosis, which is one of the molecular mechanisms of plateau zokor adaption to the hypoxic burrowing environment.			高原鼢鼠(Myospalax baileyi)是青藏高原特有的地下鼠,其地下洞道严重缺氧。一般来说,低氧会促进细胞凋亡。为了探讨高原鼢鼠适应低氧环境的分子机制,本文应用生物信息学方法对p53下游凋亡促进基因Pidd、Fas、Bax、Puma、Apaf-1、Scotin、Perp、Igfbp3和凋亡抑制基因Bcl-2的序列和编码的氨基酸序列进行了进化分析,并以SD大鼠(Rattus norvegicus)为对照,研究了这些基因在不同海拔环境条件下(3 300 m和2 260 m)的表达模式。结果表明:(1)高原鼢鼠细胞凋亡基因的序列与以色列鼹鼠(Nannospalax galili)同源性最高;预测的PIDD、PUMA、Apaf-1、IGFBP3和BCL-2编码蛋白结构域与以色列鼹鼠的存在明显的趋同进化位点;SIFT评估发现,高原鼢鼠和以色列鼹鼠与其他物种相比,p53、PIDD、PUMA、Apaf-1和IGFBP3氨基酸序列分别在78、853、157、320和285号位点的变异对其功能有显著影响;(2)在高海拔条件下(3 300 m),高原鼢鼠肺组织中凋亡促进基因Pidd、Bax、Puma和Apaf-1表达水平显著下降,凋亡抑制基因Bcl-2表达水平显著升高,而在SD大鼠中凋亡促进基因和凋亡抑制基因的表达水平均没有变化;高原鼢鼠中Bcl-2/Bax比值随海拔的升高显著上升,而在SD大鼠中没有变化。以上结果提示,高原鼢鼠p53结构变异可能导致其下游基因表达模式与SD大鼠不同,其中凋亡促进基因Pidd、Bax、Puma和Apaf-1表达水平下降,凋亡抑制基因Bcl-2表达水平上升,从而抑制了细胞在低氧条件下的凋亡;在长期低氧的作用下,高原鼢鼠p53下游基因产物PIDD、PUMA、Apaf-1和IGFBP3产生了影响其功能的变异位点,这可能改变了它们与发挥功能的复合物的结合力,从而抑制了细胞凋亡。因此,通过长期的低氧适应,高原鼢鼠肺组织中与细胞凋亡相关的基因产物结构发生变异,导致其基因表达水平发生变化,从而抑制细胞凋亡,这是高原鼢鼠适应地下低氧洞道生境的分子机制之一。						0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0250-3263			CSCD:6596565

In this work, NixCo1-xO@C/CdS hybrid is successfully fabricated through an electrostatic interaction of oppositely charged nanoparticles on their surfaces. The resulting NixCo1-xO@C nanoboxes cocatalysts which were derived from NiCo-LDH@ZIF-67 with NieCo layered double hydroxides (LDH) decorated with ZIF-67 precursor exhibited improved hydrogen production rate compared with bare CdS semiconductor from 0.7 mmol g(-1) h(-1) to 56 mmol g(-1) h(-1). It is demonstrated that the electrostatic interaction between the two surface charged nanoparticles of NixCo1-xO@C and CdS play an important role in migrating and separating of photogenerated charge carriers. The synthesized NixCo1-xO@C as excellent candidates for cost-effective cocatalysts is aimed to substitute for noble metals in photocatalytic H-2 evolution. (C) 2020 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC.

Co3O4-MNR exhibits highly effective photothermocatalytic activity and excellent durability for the gas-phase oxidation of benzene (a recalcitrant poisonous air pollutant) under UV-visible-infrared illumination from a Xe lamp. It is discovered for the first time that the presence of Co2+ vacancies in Co3O4-MNR massively enhances the photothermocatalytic activity of Co3O4. Compared to a commercial Co3O4 sample (Aladdin) with a smaller number of Co2+ vacancies and TiO2 (P25), the CO2 production rate of Co3O4-MNR is massively increased by 165 and 309 times, respectively. Co3O4-MNR exhibits efficient photothermocatalytic activity for benzene oxidation even under the visible-infrared illumination of lambda > 690 nm. The catalytic oxidation of benzene on Co3O4-MNR under the illumination of the Xe lamp follows a mechanism of solar-light-driven thermocatalysis. The experimental evidence of CO-TPR as well as theoretical evidence of density functional theory (DFT) calculations demonstrate that the presence of Co2+ vacancies in Co3O4-MNR significantly increases the activity of the lattice oxygen in Co3O4, thus massively promoting the thermocatalytic activity of Co3O4. Interestingly, a novel photoactivation on Co3O4, quite different from the conventional photocatalysis of semiconductor photocatalysts such as TiO2, is discovered to considerably increase the solar-light-driven thermocatalytic activity of Co3O4-MNR. By combining the experimental evidence of isotope labeling, CO-TPR, and FTIR with the DFT calculations, we obtain a deep insight into the novel photoactivation: the illumination from the Xe lamp enhances the activity of the lattice oxygen in Co3O4-MNR, thus considerably promoting the solar-light-driven thermocatalytic activity of Co3O4-MNR.									57	3	0	0	9	0	57			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000431003600054

Here, we study the thermal evolution of structural defects in wurtzite ZnO samples implanted at room temperature with a wide range of ion species (from B-11 to Bi-209) to ion doses up to 2 x 10(16) cm(-2). The structural disorder was characterized by a combination of Rutherford backscattering spectrometry, nuclear reaction analysis, and transmission electron microscopy, while secondary ion mass spectrometry was used to monitor the behavior of both the implanted elements and residual impurities, such as Li. The results show that the damage formation and its thermal evolution strongly depend on the ion species. In particular, for F implanted samples, a strong out-diffusion of the implanted ions results in an efficient crystal recovery already at 600 degrees C, while co-implantation with B (via BF2) ions suppresses both the F out-diffusion and the lattice recovery at such low temperatures. The damage produced by heavy ions (such as Cd, Au, and Bi) exhibits a two-stage annealing behavior where efficient removal of point defects and small defect clusters occurs at temperatures similar to 500 degrees C, while the second stage is characterized by a gradual and partial annealing of extended defects. These defects can persist even after treatment at 900 degrees C. In contrast, the defects produced by light and medium mass ions (O, B, and Zn) exhibit a more gradual annealing with increasing temperature without distinct stages. In addition, effects of the implanted species may lead to a nontrivial defect evolution during the annealing, with N, Ag, and Er as prime examples. In general, the obtained results are interpreted in terms of formation of different dopant-defect complexes and their thermal stability.

A specific capacity value as high as 113.8 mA h g(-1) after 1000 cycles is attained. In order to not only clarify the mechanism for the improvement by the RuO2 particles deposited, but also to elucidate which chemical properties of surface-modifying materials play a critical role in the evolution of the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) layer with cycling, the electrochemical impedance spectra and X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS) of a bare LNMO electrode, discrete RuO2 particle modified-LNMO electrode and discrete Al2O3 particle modified-LNMO electrode were compared. The XPS spectra of the SEI layers of these electrodes cycled between 4.5 and 5.2 V indicate that a stable SEI layer on the RuO2-modified LNMO electrode has the characteristics of higher content of LiF and longer poly-ethylenecarbonate chains with extremely low content of -CF2O-groups. The crucial point for the formation of the stable SEI layer is the sustainable consumption of the F radicals generated by the electrochemical decomposition of LiPF6 at high potentials. We conclude that the hydrolysable property of ruthenium fluorides, intermediate products obtained during the formation of the SEI layer on the RuO2-modified LNMO electrode, and the high catalytic activity of RuO2 itself for electrochemical oxygen evolution guarantee the sustainable consumption of the F radicals. Al2O3 lacks these special chemical properties to attain the sustainable consumption, thus leading to no improvement by the modification with discrete Al2O3 particles.									28	2	0	0	0	0	31			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000358211700013

Removal of boron from hydraulic fracturing wastewater can promote the recycling of water resources. Electrocoagulation is an environmentally friendly method for boron removal, which has attracted wide attention in recent years. In this work, electrochemical and chemical methods were used to analyze the difference of the performance of iron anodes in boron removal, and the role of anode polarization in the process of boron removal was discussed. The results show that for Q235 CS, the boron removal efficiency increases from 7% to 16% as the potential moves from R-1 (-0.5 to (-0.2) V) to R-3 (0.5-0.8 V). Similarly, for 304 SS, maximum boron removal efficiency can be achieved at R3. Strong anodic polarization not only allows direct dissolution of Fe3+ ions, but also promotes the formation of oxides. Both processes are beneficial to the formation of iron products and have good coagulability. This work provides a new perspective for the research of electrocoagulation technology and is beneficial to the improvement of existing technology.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2213-2929	2213-3437		WOS:000788095100004

In this study, using a combination of ab initio steered molecular dynamics, enhanced sampling, and ab initio thermodynamics, we investigate the surface stability and dissolution of three prominent electro(photo)catalysts for water splitting: RuO2, IrO2, and TiO2 in the rutile phase. We provide an atomistic understanding of the dissolution process and establish possible dissolution paths for different oxides using the (110) surface as a prototype. Interestingly, we identify a distinct surface site specificity in the dissolution of the RuO2(110) surface, with the coordinately undersaturated sites more prone to dissolution, whereas no such surface site specificity exists for the IrO2(110) surface. In addition, our investigation of more complex dissolution mechanisms involving codissolution of the different surface sites on the RuO2(110) surface reveals a hitherto unseen suppression of the dissolution of Ru from the bridge sites caused by the codissolving coordinately undersaturated sites. These findings provide routes to improving the stability and a path toward understanding the activity-stability conundrum in electrocatalytic water splitting.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			1932-7447	1932-7455		WOS:000742120100001

The synergistic effect between Mn and Co ions provides mixed valence states and adjusts the bandgap for accelerating the high redox reaction kinetics and improving the electron mobility and electrical conductivity. Meanwhile, the nanosheet structure provides rich electroactive sites and excellent structural stability for facilitating the electron transfer and resisting structural damage. As expected, the obtained Mn-CoP/NF electrode acquired a superior specific capacity (456 C g(-1) at 0.5 A g(-1)), an excellent rate performance (77.4% capacity retention at 10 A g(-1)), and an excellent cyclability (89.0% capacity retention after 20,000 cycles). The Mn-CoP/NF//AC asymmetric supercapacitor (ASC) delivers a high energy density (14.82 W h kg(-1) at 312 W kg(-1)) and long-term durability (87.7% capacity retention after 20,000 cycles). Moreover, two ASC devices can be used to light an LED for 6 min, demonstrating ASC's promising practical applications.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			2574-0962			WOS:000735958100001

Transition metal chalcogenides are potential catalysts for processes resulting in energy generation and storage. In order to optimize their catalytic performance, high phase purity and precise control over shape and size are indispensable. Metal-organic precursors with pre-formed bonds between the metal and the chalcogenide atoms are advantageous in synthesizing phase pure transition metal chalcogenides with controlled shape and sizes. This can be achieved by the decomposition of metal-organic precursors in the presence of suitable surfactants/capping agents. However, the recent studies on electrocatalysis at the nanoscale level reveal that the capping agents attached to their surface have a detrimental effect on their efficiency. The removal of surfactants from active sites to obtain bare surface nanoparticles is necessary to enhance catalytic activity. Herein, we have discussed the properties of different metal-organic precursors and the role of surfactants in the colloidal synthesis of metal chalcogenide nanomaterials. Moreover, the effect of surfactants on their electrocatalytic performance, the commonly used strategies for removing surfactants from the surface of nanomaterials and the future perspectives are reviewed.									10	0	0	0	1	0	10			1477-9226	1477-9234		WOS:000683058400001	34369529

Herein, a flexible electrode composed of Co-Ni-P ternary catalysts and carbon fiber paper substrate (Co-Ni-P/CFP) was successfully fabricated and applied in water electrolysis. The Co-Ni-P coatings were deposited on CFP by a one-step cyclic voltammetric electrodeposition method and the surface of the composite material exhibits nano-reticular structure. The formation mechanism was also discussed according to the results of material characterization. Notably, the Co-Ni-P/CFP flexible electrode exhibited superior catalytic performance for both hydrogen and oxygen evolution reactions in alkaline media, which could achieve 10 mA/cm(2) current density with overpotential of 89 mV for HER and 320 mV for OER. Moreover, the Co-Ni-P/CFP electrode could also be used as both anode and cathode electrode to drive overall water splitting and required only 1.64 V to achieve a current density of 10 mA/cm(2), which was very close to that of the commercial combination of Pt/C and IrO2. This affordable and easily obtained electrode offers a new avenue to develop earth-abundant resource catalysts for water electrolysis system.									6	1	0	0	0	0	7			1432-8488	1433-0768		WOS:000626795900002

For sufficiently small tube diameter, the detonation decays to a deflagration and the shock decays to negligible strengths. This is known as the critical tube diameter problem. In the present study, we provide a closed form model to predict the detonation quenching for 2D channels. Whitham's geometric shock dynamics, coupled with a shock evolution law based on shocks sustained by a constant source obtained by the shock change equations of Radulescu, is shown to capture the lateral shock dynamics response to the failure wave originating at the expansion corner. A criterion for successful detonation transmission to open space is that the lateral strain rate provided by the failure wave does not exceed the critical strain rate of steady curved detonations. Using the critical lateral strain rate obtained by He and Clavin, a closed form solution is obtained for the critical channel opening permitting detonation transmission. The predicted critical channel width is found in very good agreement with our recent experiments and simulations of diffracting H-2/O-2/Ar detonations.									7	0	0	0	0	0	7			1070-6631	1089-7666		WOS:000677519200006

In this work, we present first-principles calculations on the engineering of the electronic structure of BaTiO3 by creating defects and introducing dopants for its application in photocatalytic water-splitting. We show that native vacancies may change its conducting character, but is difficult to reduce its band gap. The reduction of band gap can be achieved by hydrogenation at high density and N substitution of oxygen, resulting in enhanced sun-light absorption. We further show that intermediate bands are created by substituting Ba with NH-pair and inserting interstitial N. These intermediate bands play an important role in the visible-light absorption. We expect that BaTiO3 with band structure modified by hydrogenation, N-doping, and NH-codoping can be applicable in solar-energy harvesting with improved efficiency.

Herein, the core-shell hy-brids composed of Co(PO3)2 nanorod core and NiFe alloy shell in situ grown on nickel foam (NiFe/Co(PO3)2@NF) are synthesized. Owing to the hierarchical palm-leaf-like structures and strong adhesion between NiFe alloys, Co(PO3)2 and substrates, the catalyst provides a large surface area and rapid charge transfer, which facilitates active sites exposure and conductivity enhancement. The interfacial effect in the NiFe/Co(PO3)2 core-shell structure modulates the electronic structure of the active sites around the boundary, thereby boosting the intrinsic activity. Benefiting from the stable structure, the durability of the catalyst is not impaired by the inevitable surface reconfiguration. The NiFe/Co(PO3)2@NF electrode presents a low cell voltage of 1.63 V to achieve 10 mA cm-2 and manifests durability for up to 36 h at different current densities.(c) 2022 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC.

Nickel catalyst migration in an anion exchange membrane fuel cell								ELECTROCHIMICA ACTA				364						137091	10.1016/j.electacta.2020.137091				DEC 20 2020	2020	Nickel materials have been widely studied as non-platinum group metal (non-PGM) cathode catalysts for anion exchange membrane fuel cells (AEMFC). Although the stability of Ni based catalysts has been tested by accelerated potential cycling, this analysis does not fully simulate the operating AEMFC conditions. For back-up power systems, the standby AEMFCs need to be held at a high steady state cell potential. For cathode catalysts, this may be more challenging than cycled potentials. As Ni dissolution has been reported from Ni and Ni alloyed catalysts under cycled cathode potentials, its stability under steady state potentials should be questioned. In this study, a Ni on Vulcan (R) XC72 carbon (Ni/C) was tested at the cathode of a simulated AEMFC, under a 0.9 V steady state cell potential for 1500 h. After operation, in addition to Ni oxidation at the cathode, Ni dissolution and migration was found resulting in cathode catalyst morphology changes and Ni(OH)(2) deposits on the anode. These results were supported by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), scanning transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS) analyses. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

Herein, a surface-modified g-C3N4 was synthesized by the co-condensation of urea + thiourea and 2-methyl imidazole. Physicochemical characterizations reveal that O and C are co-doped, as evident by the XPS and solid-state NMR spectroscopy. The light absorption edge is red shifted, lifetimes of the charge carriers, and electron injection efficiencies are ameliorated appropriately. Photocatalysts are employed in the CO2 reduction (from TEOA dissolved water + CO2 gas mixture) and H2O2 production (from pure H2O and O-2 in absence of any organic electron/proton donor) without involving any cocatalyst. CO2-adsorption/TPD measurements support the higher CO2 uptake and lower adsorption energy after the surface modification as confirmed from DFT calculation. Mott-Schottky and VBXPS confirm that C, O co-doping bring required thermodynamic potential that facilitates the CO2/CH3OH and O-2/H2O2 reactions.									93	8	0	0	8	0	94			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000488308800053

In comparison to classical Cu(OH)(2), 1 exhibits improved thermal stability of up to ca. 350 degrees C. Chronoamperometry studies indicate that catalyst 1 reaches an anodic current density of 0.1 mA cm(-2) at eta = 576 mV; a TOF of 2x10(-3) s(-1) at 418 mV overpotential value. The catalyst 1 shows Faradaic efficiency of 95%. Long-term catalytic studies for 10 h at a constant potential of 1.2 V indicate that compound 1 is robust and retains its chemical composition. Infrared spectroscopy, powder X-ray diffraction analysis, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and cyclic voltammetry studies of the pristine and post-catalytic compound 1-coated FTO electrodes further confirm that 1 retains its structural integrity throughout the catalytic cycle. Our results represent a proof-of-concept for designing next-generation robust and improved OER electrocatalysts based on earth-abundant metals.									6	0	0	0	1	0	6			0020-1693	1873-3255		WOS:000487820000011

However, the operating temperature in SOFC will rise up to 800-1000. due to redox reaction among hydrogen and oxygen ions. This provides a suitable environment for ions transporting through ceramic materials. Under such operation temperatures, degradation may occur in the electrodes and electrolyte. As a result, unstable voltage, low capacity and cell failure may eventually occur. This study presents thermomechanical analysis of a porous SOFC cell plate which contains electrodes, electrolytes and pores. A microscale specimen in the shape of a plate is considered in order to maintain uniform temperature loading and increase the accuracy of estimation. A new computational technique, peridynamics, is utilized to calculate the deformations and stresses of the cell plate. Moreover, the crack formation and propagation are also obtained by using peridynamics. According to the numerical results, damage evolution depends on the electrolyte/electrode interface strength during the charging process. For weak interface strength case, damage emerges at the electrode/electrolyte interface. On the other hand, for stronger interface cases, damage emerges on pore boundaries especially with sharp corner.									7	0	0	0	0	0	7			2333-8326	2333-8334		WOS:000413018700001

In contrast with bare Pt nanoparticles (deposited at a glassy carbon substrate), application of the hybrid system produces sizeable CO2-reduction currents in comparison to those originating from hydrogen evolution. The result is consistent with an enhancement in the reduction of carbon dioxide. However, the biofilm-based matrix tends to inhibit the catalytic properties of platinum towards proton discharge (competitive reaction) or even oxygen reduction. The hydrated structure permits easy unimpeded flow of aqueous electrolyte at the electrocatalytic interface. Although application of the polyaniline underlayer can be interpreted in terms of stabilization and improvement of the biofilm adherence, the use of carbon nanotubes facilitates electron transfer to Pt catalytic sites. It is apparent from the voltammetric stripping-type analytical experiments that, although formation of some methanol and methanoic acid cannot be excluded, carbon monoxide seems to be the main CO2-reduction product.					5th Molecular Materials Meeting (M3) at Singapore5th Molecular Materials Meeting (M3) at Singapore	AUG 03-05, 2015AUG 03-05, 2015		Singapore, SINGAPORESingapore, SINGAPORE	4	0	0	0	0	0	4			0004-9425	1445-0038		WOS:000374182400008

Furthermore, it has been still necessary to combine the active material with a supporting matrix in an optimized structure for stability and surface accessibility. Herein, we report a predictive fabrication method for the system where NiP2 nanoparticles has beenevenly embedded in carbon nanofibers (CNFs), which is expected to be superior by theoretical calculation but not successfully made so far. Through thermodynamic considerations on the inter-component reactions against processing variables, such as temperature, partial pressure of oxygen and phosphorus (pO(2), pP(4)), a suitable two-step synthesis route consisting of successive pO(2)-controlled carbonization and pP(4)-controlled phosphidation was deduced. The obtained NiP2/CNFs had the desired electrocatalytic properties as well as physical features, including maximized surface area and well-combined structure. Consequently, the catalysts had overpotentials of only 71 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) and long-term stability of over 100 hours with less than 10% degradation under the operating conditions.									17	0	0	0	2	0	17			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000463819400014

In this paper, the feasibility of using basic oxygen furnace (BOF) steel slag aggregate in metakaolin-based geopolymer was systematically evaluated. Tests results showed the use of steel slag aggregate (SSA) as full replacement of natural limestone aggregate could yield higher volume stability, improved compressive strength, smaller drying shrinkage and enhanced anti-freeze property of geopolymer concrete. Moreover, the activator of water glass was demonstrated to be superior to NaOH because free oxides in steel slag could be consumed in water glass solution. Discussion on the mechanism behind the superiority of BOF SSA in conjunction with alkalis was elaborated from the perspective of chemical reaction. The geopolymer matrix and interfacial transition zone (ITZ) were enhanced due to the diffusion of Ca ions to form the gel and densify the microstructure. Techniques of XRD, TGA, SEM/EDX were utilized for the analysis of the improved geopolymer matrix and strengthened ITZ. This research could facilitate the recycling and upgrading of steel slag for construction.									18	0	0	0	2	0	18			0950-0618	1879-0526		WOS:000687383000005

A higher content of sp(3) carbon on the surface favors the generation of hydroxyl radicals over the oxygen evolution reaction, which generates different degradation byproducts. In this work, we studied the degradation of aniline by anodic oxidation using five BDD electrodes with different sp(3)/sp(2) ratios in sulfate and chloride media. Aniline was degraded using the five BDD electrodes in both electrolytes, and clear differences were observed in the intermediates produced during the electrolysis. BDD electrodes with higher sp(3) proportions allowed for greater degradation and mineralization of aniline with lower molecular weight and the production of fewer toxic organic byproducts. Degradation pathways for aniline in sulfate and chloride media are proposed, evidencing the differences in the oxidation mechanisms for aniline and its byproducts due to the varying sp(3)/sp(2) ratio in the BDD electrodes.									10	0	0	0	1	0	10			2196-0216			WOS:000487858400010

Tissue-specific variation in redox signaling and cellular responses to oxidative stress may be associated with vulnerability especially to age-related and chronic diseases. In order to provide a basis for tissue-specific difference, we examined the tissue-specific transcriptional features of 101 oxidative stress-associated genes in 10 different tissues and organs of healthy mice under physiological conditions. Microarray analysis results, which were consistent with quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) results, showed that catalase, Gpx3, and Gpx4 were most highly regulated in the liver, kidney, and testes. We also found the tissue-specific gene expression of SOD1 (liver and kidney), SOD2 (heart and muscle), and SOD3 (lung and kidney). The current results will serve as a reference for animal models and help advance our understanding of tissue-specific variability in oxidative stress-associated pathogenesis.									21	0	1	0	17	0	22				1422-0067		WOS:000448951000329	30326626

Scaling relations between the adsorption energies of reaction intermediates greatly facilitate the computational design of catalysts. However, this methodology does not currently incorporate structure sensitivity and hence cannot describe adequately the overall activity of realistic catalyst particles and extended surfaces with several facets, edges and apices. Here, we generalize scaling relations by examining twelve different low-index, stepped and kinked surfaces of nine transition metals. This allows us to quantify the effect of the adsorption-site geometry on these relations, ensures a full prediction of their parameters, and helps in identifying intrinsic thermodynamic restrictions to the performance of catalysts. The resulting fully predictable, structure-sensitive scaling relations are a step towards the long-sought rational design of multifaceted catalytic particles. Such a design can now target not only the chemical nature of active materials but also the actual geometry of their active sites.									439	6	0	0	29	0	440			1755-4330	1755-4349		WOS:000353347900013	25901818

Photoelectrocatalytic properties of the powder catalysts were characterized using photocurrent spectroscopy at different wavelengths demonstrating on the one hand the stability of the films and on the other hand the electrical connection with the electrode surface. The morphology and thickness of the deposited powder catalyst films on TCO were characterized using scanning electron microscopy. Aiming at photocatalytic water splitting, semiconductor powders like gallium oxide (Ga2O3) and zinc oxide (ZnO) were used as test samples to optimize the deposition technique resulting in thin homogeneous layers and good adhesion on the conductive substrate. The proposed airbrush deposition technique of powder catalysts allows closing an experimental gap between microheterogeneous systems and modified electrodes for finding suitable materials for photoelectrochemical water splitting.									8	0	0	0	0	0	8			1040-0397	1521-4109		WOS:000349558900004

Except for Co-Cr-B, all the Co-M-B catalysts showed better hydrogen evolution rate than Co-B, with the lowest overpotential of 95 mV and 67 mV (at 10 mA/cm(2)) recorded for optimized Co-Mo-B catalyst, in pH 7 and pH 14, respectively. The reasons for enhancement in electrocatalytic rate, with inclusion of a second metal in CoB, were investigated by considering several material related factors, such as, physical and electrochemical surface area, turn-over frequency, surface elemental states & composition and charge-transfer resistance. These experimental results were complemented with computational investigations to identify the most suitable sites for hydrogen adsorption and determine their H-adsorption energies. In the end, industrial feasibility of the developed Co-M-B catalysts was illustrated by performing stability and recycling tests. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

However, the limited natural abundance of deuterium and the complexity of established technologies, such as quantum sieving (QS) for deuterium production under extreme conditions, pose challenges. The new method has the potential for robust and sustainable deuterium evolution, enabling deuterium production at a high rate of 9.745 mmol g(-1) h(-1). The activity, thermodynamic, and kinetic characteristics are also investigated and compared between photocatalytic heavy water (D2O) splitting and water (H2O) splitting.

However, access to 2D anatase TiO2 is limited by the non-layered nature of the bulk crystal, which does not allow use of top-down chemical exfoliation. Large efforts have been dedicated to the growth of 2D anatase TiO2 with high reactive facets by bottom-up approaches, which relies on the use of harmful chemical reagents. Here, we demonstrate a novel fluorine-free strategy based on topochemical conversion of 2D 1T-TiS2 for the production of single crystalline 2D anatase TiO2, exposing the {001} facet on the top and bottom and {100} at the sides of the nanosheet. The exposure of these faces, with no additional defects or doping, gives rise to a significant activity enhancement in the hydrogen evolution reaction, as compared to commercially available Degussa P25 TiO2 nanoparticles. Because of the strong potential of TiO2 in many energy-based applications, our topochemical approach offers a low cost, green and mass scalable route for production of highly crystalline anatase TiO2 with well controlled and highly reactive exposed facets.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000813442300001	35872702

Since energy density has a quadratic dependence on voltage, broadening the operating voltage window of the supercapacitors (SCs) could be an effective strategy to boost the energy density over improving the electrode's capacitance if one can avoid excessive leakage current density. On extending the voltage window of the SC beyond the water electrolysis potentials in an aqueous medium, the combined effect of the choice of the electrode material and pH of the electrolyte plays an important role. In the present work, activated carbon (ACTS-800) derived from Tamarind seeds, a widely available cheap bio-mass, pyrolyzed at 800 degrees C, is explored as a potential electrode material for fabricating a high voltage SC in aqueous 1 M Na2SO4. Interestingly, the beneficial interaction between the surface functional groups and electrolyte resulted in the high overpotentials for both hydrogen and oxygen evolution reactions in the neutral medium. ACTS-800 exhibited superior performance in terms of energy density (28 Wh kg(-1)), and leakage current density (0.33 mA cm(-2)) to many reported carbon materials derived from various bio-sources.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			0013-4651	1945-7111		WOS:000675675500001

Hydrogen production through PEC provides a green and sustainable source of energy and addresses the solar intermittency problem. While considerable efforts have been made over the past several decades but till date, there is no solar water splitting materials that simultaneously fulfills the high efficiency, long-term stability and low cost. In PEC, the semiconductor materials must exhibit sufficient voltage on irradiation to split water, long-term stability against corrosion in the aqueous electrolyte and the band edge potentials at the surfaces. The charge transfer from surface of the semiconductor to the electrolyte must be facile to minimize energy loss due to kinetic overpotential and selective for the oxygen and hydrogen evolution reaction. The photocatalysts such as TiO2, WO3, CuGaSe2, InGaN, Fe2O3, Cu2O etc. are the most promising semiconductor material due to its suitable band gap and valance band structure. But, the major concern in PEC water splitting is charge separation and transportation. Various strategies such as controlling the morphology, introducing defects, constructing a heterojunction and loading a co-catalyst are used raise the efficiency of PEC process.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0019-4522			WOS:000654267600025

In addition, the intrinsic mechanism of the current density influence is explored based on the Li2CO3 morphology evolution. Superoxide anion radical species (O-2(.-) ) were identified to be rapidly consumed by CO2, which dramatically enhances the stability of Li-O-2 batteries. The results indicate that the NiCo2O4 nanocatalyst can efficiently inhibit Li2CO3 aggregation and realize the maximum utilization of active sites. The results confirm that the 3D dandelion-like NiCo2O4 catalyst can be a potential cathode for Li-CO2/O-2 batteries.									12	1	0	0	0	0	13			1867-3880	1867-3899		WOS:000477937300020

SEM and XRD experiments revealed that the adulteration of Yb can decrease the crystal grain size and make the electrodes more compact. Electrochemical measurements, accelerated service lifetime and bulk electrolysis experiments proved that Yb-doped PbO2 electrodes had higher oxygen evolution overpotential, stability and acetamiprid removal ratio than pure PbO2 electrodes. The effect of operating parameters, such as current density, initial acetamiprid concentration, and pH value, on the electrocatalytic degradation of acetamiprid were systematically studied. The electrocatalytic oxidation reaction of acetamiprid on Yb-doped PbO2 electrodes was highly effective, which obeyed the pseudo-first-order kinetics model. Intermediates analysis and electrocatalytic degradation mechanism of acetamiprid by Yb-doped PbO2 electrodes were implemented, and the degradation pathways were divided into three different sub-routes due to three function groups on acetamiprid initially attacked by hydroxyl radicals. Finally, all the byproducts were decontaminated into CO2 and H2O. These results proved that Yb-doped PbO2 electrodes have more promising application potential for the electrocatalytic degradation of refractory organic pollutants.									64	7	0	0	17	0	68			1383-5866	1873-3794		WOS:000456226300051

Herein, we report an effective approach to synthesize three dimensional (3D) mixed-metal organic framework-coated ZnO nanowires array (ZnNi MOF@ZnO) for the effective PEC performance. The ZnO nanowires act as photon absorber as well as rapid charge transporter; whilst the ZnNi MOF provides the active sites for PEC process by lowering the energy barrier of water oxidation and suppressing electron-hole recombination. The 3D nanostructure of ZnNi MOF@ZnO nanowires array provides intimate interfacial contact through covalent interactions between the ZnNi MOF and ZnO nanowires which facilitates the rapid charge transfer during photocatalytic oxygen evolution reactions. As a result, the ZnNi MOF@ZnO nanowires array exhibited excellent photoelectrochemical water oxidation with very low onset potential (0.31 V vs. RHE) and high photocurrent density (1.40 mA/cm(2)) as compared to the Zn MOF@ZnO and ZnO nanowires array. This facile strategy provides a promising direction towards high performance photoanode design for adequate solar energy conversion. (C) 2018 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC.

This surface plasmon resonance (SPR) of metal nanoparticles (NPs) can augment photosynthetic chemical energy production in an artificial photosynthetic model system. In this paper, the effect of three water-dispersible gold NPs (GNPs) of nearly similar size but with different surface moieties (aspartate, bovine serum albumin, and citrate capping) is experimentally shown on the photosynthetic efficiency of isolated chloroplasts of Vigna radiata. It was found that GNPs can augment photon absorption in the light-harvesting molecular complexes (LHMCs) and can cause increased distinctive optical and electronic properties. Photosynthetic light reactions like electron transport rate, photophosphorylation, and oxygen evolution rate were increased in the presence of GNPs, indicating higher photosynthetic activity. The rate of increase was dependent on the surface capping of GNPs, and it was maximum in case of citrate-capped GNP. Moreover, it was also found that these GNP-induced enhancements had positive correlation with the primary growth parameters of V. radiata.									15	0	1	0	13	0	15			2364-821X	2190-7579		WOS:000411125800004

In this study, non-precious metal ORR electrocatalysts derived by the encapsulation of Co nanoparticles in N-doped graphene nanoshells were synthesized by a typical one-step pyrolysis process. Compared with commercial Pt/C catalysts, the prepared Co-30@N-G hybrid electrocatalyst showed a high ORR activity at the same level in an alkaline medium. Subsequently, the Co-30@N-G hybrid electrocatalyst has been used as a cathode of Zn-air batteries, which displays equivalent performance to the systems derived using a commercial Pt/C catalyst. The Co-30@N-G derived mechanical rechargeable Zn-air battery showed a persistent flat discharge curve with minimum voltage loss at a high discharge rate of 40 mA cm(-2). The robustness of the Co-30@N-G ORR catalyst can allow the batteries to work constantly by periodically replacing the Zn anode and electrolyte, presenting an efficient and economical cathode for Zn-air flow batteries or Zn-air fuel cells.									19	1	0	0	1	0	19			2046-2069			WOS:000385451800012

They present higher chemical selectivity than conventional amperometric microdisks, and may be the only effective option to visualize the dissolution of metals with negative redox potentials in aqueous environments when the use of Pt microelectrodes is limited by the onset of oxygen reduction and hydrogen evolution reactions. A robust micro-sized ion selective electrode has been developed which allows the spatial distribution of Zn2+ during galvanic corrosion of a model Fe/Zn couple to be investigated using SECM. Owing to the low internal contact potential achieved with the novel design, the resistance of the micropipette electrodes is only fractions of the resistance of conventional micropipette electrodes of the same size. As a result, no special shielding of the microelectrodes is required and higher scanning rate can be used for scanning in the potentiometric modes using these micropipette tips. Concentration profiles over corroding surfaces measured with this technique will be presented. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.									29	1	0	0	1	0	29			0013-4686			WOS:000299911500057

In this study, using nickel-cobalt layered double hydroxide (NiCo-LDH) as precursor, a simple two-step method was used to prepare three-dimensional (3D) Setaria viridis-like NiCoSe2 nanoneedles arrays on nickel foam (NiCoSe2 NNA/NF). Benefiting from the abundant catalytic active sites provided by the 3D nanoneedles array structure, the covalent reciprocity between Ni, Co and Se can effectively facilitate the free movement of ions and electrons on the electrode surface. As a hydrazine sensor, the electrochemical performance of the NiCoSe2 NNA/NF was studied by cyclic voltammetry (CV) and other electrochemical techniques, which exhibits outstanding electrocatalytic performance. When the signal-to-noise ratio is 3 (S/N = 3), the sensitivity is 16170 mu A mM-1 cm-2, the lower detection limit is 0.5 mu M. It also shows well anti-interference and long-term stability. In addition, the successful applications in water environments samples also demonstrated the feasibility of the sensor. This method provides a new idea for the development of selenide-based electrochemical sensors.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0927-7757	1873-4359		WOS:000870806800005

However, the catalytic mechanism has been debated for decades owing to the existence of various oxidation states of Cu and their dynamical evolution during the reaction process. Herein, based on first-principles theoretical calculations, a highly active [Cu4O] moiety was identified on the partially reduced Cu2O(111) surface. In contrast to a previous mechanism in which Cu-0, Cu+, or their combination was proposed, Cu atoms in the [Cu4O] moiety are in a fractional oxidation state (+0.5) and have bonding characteristics analogous to both metallic Cu and Cu2O. The [Cu4O] moiety has both electronic and geometric advantages in surface catalysis, showing high activity in methanol dehydrogenation. Experimental work further provided evidence for the existence of such mixed-valence Cu species and confirmed its high activity in methanol dehydrogenation. This work unravels the active sites in the partially reduced Cu species and provides insights into the rational design of more active Cu-based catalysts.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2155-5435			WOS:000813332600001

Rechargeable flexible metal-air batteries (MABs) are expected to be one of the most ideal ESCDs due to their high theoretical energy density, cost advantage, and strong deformation adaptability. With the improvement of the device design, material assemblies, and manufacturing technology, the research on the electrochemical performance of flexible MABs has made significant progress. However, achieving the high mechanical flexibility, high safety, and wearable comfortability required by FEDs while maintaining the high performance of flexible MABs are still a daunting challenge. In this review, flexible Zn-air and Li-air batteries are mainly exemplified to describe the most recent progress and challenges of flexible MABs. We start with an overview of the structure and configuration of the flexible MABs and discuss their impact on battery performance and function. Then it focuses on the research progress of flexible metal anodes, gel polymer electrolytes, and air cathodes. Finally, the main challenges and future research perspectives involving flexible MABs for FEDs are proposed.									11	0	0	0	1	0	11			2766-8525	2688-819X		WOS:000854102300006

We have investigated the electrocatalytic properties of Au/Ag core-shell nanorods (Au/Ag NRs) where Ag shell was thinned by aging in the presence of cetyltrimethylammonium bromide. We observed excellent electrocatalysis toward hydrogen peroxide electroreduction upon decreasing the Ag shell thickness, which would, at first, appear to imply a strong synergistic effect of the Au core with the Ag shell for electrocatalysis. We show, however, that this electrocatalysis is not caused by particular Au/Ag core/shell structures but rather by the presence of residual silver impurities in the form of Ag nanoparticles (Ag NPs) formed during the preparation of the thin-layer silver shell/gold core nanorods.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			1040-0397	1521-4109		WOS:000491476600005

We present new machine learning models that can predict the energy of the oxidative addition process between a transition metal complex and a substrate for C-C cross-coupling reactions. In turn, this quantity can be used as a descriptor to estimate the activity of homogeneous catalysts using molecular volcano plots. The versatility of this approach is illustrated for vast libraries of organometallic catalysts based on Pt, Pd, Ni, Cu, Ag, and Au combined with 91 ligands. Out-of-sample machine learning predictions were made on a total of 18062 compounds leading to 557 catalyst candidates falling into the ideal thermodynamic window. This number was further refined by searching for candidates with an estimated price lower than 10 US$ per mmol. The 37 catalyst finalists are dominated by palladium phosphine ligand combinations but also include the earth abundant transition metal (Cu) with less common ligands. Our results indicate that modern statistical learning techniques can be applied to the computational discovery of readily available and promising catalyst candidates.									115	1	0	0	5	0	115			2041-6520	2041-6539		WOS:000445777400005	30310627

In this work, we designed and synthesized a diphenoxy-based salen-type Schiff base ligand (L) in order to overcome the problems that so far have prevented the use of chromium complexes as water oxidation catalysts (WOCs). Cyclic voltammetry measurements performed in the alkaline solution of [Cr(L-2H) Cl] (1) displayed a large irreversible oxidation waves, corresponding to the catalytic water oxidation. The main species in the catalytically active solutions is found to be [Cr(L-2H) ClOH](-). The proposed catalytic system generates a current density (J) of 1.0 mA cm(-2) at the relatively low overpotential (eta) of 0.426 V with a high turnover frequency (TOF) of 49.7 s(-1). A comprehensive mechanistic study was carried out based on the results of experiments, calculations and according to previous works. The computational calculations supported the importance of the uncoordinated eOH groups present in the ligand moiety of the complex for the oxidation of Cr3+ to Cr4+. (c) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

A MnNi2O4 nanoparticle material is also synthesized via the sol-gel method to explore the effect of surface area, pore diameter and pore volume on catalytic activity. The crystal phase and morphology of the samples are confirmed by X-ray diffractometry and transmission electron microscopy. Linear sweep voltammetry analysis shows that the MnNi2O4 nanorods electrode exhibits better activities in oxygen reduction and evolution reactions than the prepared MnNi2O4 nanoparticles or Ketjenblack electrodes. The sequenced activities of these three materials are further supported by a reduction in both the discharge and recharge overpotentials during battery tests. Furthermore, batteries with the MnNi2O4 nanorods present improved rate capability and cyclability compared with the MnNi2O4 nanoparticles and Ketjenblack. This enhanced performance is explained by the large surface area, mean pore diameter, and pore volume of the MnNi2O4 nanorods. These results highlight the importance of porous MnNi2O4 nanorods as a prospective bifunctional catalyst and a potential method of electrospinning to scale up the preparation of catalysts for rechargeable Li-O-2 batteries.									8	1	0	0	0	0	9			1452-3981			WOS:000375393900057

The chars were chosen to be representative of each of the different stages of the degradation and carbonization process of the specific polyvinyl halide and/or the group as a whole. Reactions leading to the formation of surface oxidic species were followed with infrared photothermal beam deflection spectroscopy and the results discussed in relation to the nature of the individual char and its extent of carbonization. Some band assignments to specific surface species were made, and the evolution of these bands was followed and discussed in the context of the surface properties of the char precursor. Low temperature chars (< 500-degrees-C), formed before the onset of extensive polyaromatization, appeared to be more reactive to oxidation than chars obtained at 500-600-degrees-C; oxidic species observed during the oxidation of 300-500-degrees-C chars include mainly carboxylic acid, cyclic anhydride-like species, and lactones. Oxidation at temperatures > 450-degrees-C resulted in the burn-off of the chars and the accompanying loss of acidic carbonylic species.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0254-0584			WOS:A1991FT69400002

Of particular interest are various Cu-comprising nanocrystals, not only because they usually show better catalytic properties than bulk materials, but also because their well-defined structures and highly tunable compositions facilitate in-depth mechanistic studies. This review aims to summarize the latest developments of electrocatalysts for ECR, with a focus on systems using Cu-comprising nanocrystals. We first give a general introduction to the field of ECR, covering the significance of this process, reaction mechanisms, catalyst evaluation criteria, and electrolytic cell configurations. Next, we discuss Cu-comprising nanocrystals developed for ECR by categorizing them into four groups: monometallic copper, copper containing bimetals/multimetals, copper compounds, and copper-metal oxide hybrids; among these groups, we choose representative examples for detailed discussion on the synthetic methods, structural and compositional reaction sensitivities, and catalyst evolution during ECR. In the last section, we outline the challenges in this field from the fundamental and applicative aspects, and give perspectives on the expansion of catalyst varieties, the identification and preservation of active sites, and the exploration of industrially relevant operations for these nanocrystals. We hope the insights provided in this review will inspire the design and development of next-generation catalysts for ECR.

Owing to their high specific energy density and volumetric energy density, metal-air batteries especially high-safety zinc-air batteries (ZABs), have attracted widespread attention. However, limited by the reduced ionic conductivity of electrolyte and the sluggish kinetics of oxygen reduction/evolution reactions at the air cathode during discharge/charge processes below 0 degrees C, the performances of ZABs severely deteriorate. Rationally designed gel polymer electrolytes (GPEs) not only offer superior mechanical performance but also provide ZABs with accelerated ion transport to boost electrochemical performance at low temperatures. Herein, the types of GPEs towards electrochemical energy systems are first summarized. And then, the research toolbox for GPEs and assembled ZABs is put forward. Next, the design strategies for low-temperature tolerant GPEs in ZABs are highlighted, such as introduction of organic solvents, alkalization of hydrogel electrolytes, construction of double-network electrolytes, etc. Finally, current challenges and perspectives are proposed. This review provides up-to-date insights on the rational design of GPEs for ZABs, which can be expanded to other metal-air batteries, metal-sulfur batteries, metal-ion batteries and so on.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000818023000001

The determination of the minimum distance between linear anode and pipe, and the effective parameters to reach the protection potential, can be studied at two different levels. First, the use of a primary current distribution analysis allows finding the proper distance based on the geometry, physical environmental parameters, and maximum allowable potential difference of two sides of the pipe. The second level is to consider the polarizability of the cathode, then to apply the so-called secondary current distribution analysis. The primary current distribution shows that the linear anode-to-pipe distance is mainly affected by soil resistivity and pipe diameter. Secondary current distribution analysis emphasizes that the proper minimum distance is influenced by the polarization of the cathode, i.e., the overvoltages of the two cathodic reactions of oxygen reduction and hydrogen evolution. In both approaches, soil resistivity has a predominant effect on potential distribution on the pipe surface.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			0010-9312	1938-159X		WOS:000486550200014

However, the ligands or coordinations of metal ions strongly influence their catalytic activities, making it complicated for selecting better catalysts. To rationally design the MOF catalysts, we have calculated the catalytic activities of zeolitic imidazolate frameworks (ZIFs), a subset of the MOF hybrids, with the density-functional theory (DFT) methods and identified an intrinsic descriptor that governs the catalytic activities of the ZIFs. Our DFT calculations show that the unsaturated metal sites exhibit higher catalytic activities than those of the best noble metal electrocatalysts. The efficiency and selectivity of the ZIF catalysts could be improved by controlling the number of ligands/coordinations and type of metal ions. The best catalysts are identified for fuel cells, water splitting, and direct prodiction of hydrogen peroxide. The theoretical predictions are supported by experimental data. This work provides a theoretical base and guiding principles for rational design of high-performance MOF-based electrocatalysts for clean energy conversion and storage.									8	0	0	0	1	0	8			1932-7447	1932-7455		WOS:000455561100022		
J	Liang, Hongyu; Zou, He; Hu, Shaozheng				Zou, He/GXH-0280-2022				Preparation of the W18O49/g-C3N4 heterojunction catalyst with full-spectrum-driven photocatalytic N-2 photofixation ability from the UV to near infrared region								NEW JOURNAL OF CHEMISTRY				41	17			8920	8926		10.1039/c7nj01848g				SEP 7 2017	2017	As we all know, more than half of the solar spectrum is near infrared (NIR) light. However, NIR light is seldom utilized in photocatalytic reactions. In this work, the W18O49/g-C3N4 heterojunction catalyst is prepared and used for full-spectrum-driven N-2 photofixation from the UV to the NIR region for the first time. X-ray diffraction, N-2 adsorption, UV-Vis-NIR spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, photoluminescence, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and electrochemical impedance spectra were used to characterize the prepared catalysts. The result indicates that the as-prepared W18O49/g-C3N4 heterojunction catalysts display much higher N-2 photofixation performance than individual W18O49 or g-C3N4, which should be due to the improved separation rate of electron-hole pairs. g-C3N4 is the active component in the catalyst for N-2 photofixation. W18O49 plays the role of a light absorber in the full-spectrum to form more photogenerated electrons for recombining the holes in g-C3N4 through the "Z-scheme'' mechanism. A possible electron transfer route is proposed.									63	4	0	0	3	0	65			1144-0546	1369-9261		WOS:000411762600028

The interaction between MBT and copper, the corrosion inhibition effect of film formed by MBT on copper surface together with its dynamic evolution in 3.5 wt% sodium chloride solution were investigated by Auger electron spectrum (AES), ex-situ Raman spectrum, open circuit potential, potentiodynamic polarization, cyclic voltammograms, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy tests, and scanning electron microscope (SEM). The results of AES and Raman spectrum show that MBT is prone to interact with copper surface to form a complex film consisting of [Cu(I) MBT](n) (having probably polymeric nature) in isopropanol which would oxidize to degrade to form Cu(II) species and (MBT)(2) with immersion time extending in the presence of oxygen. The electrochemical tests and SEM indicate the complex film improves corrosion resistance of copper to the media containing chloride by inhibiting both anodic and cathodic reactions with interfering the transport of Cucl(2)(-) and O-2, and the inhibition effect of [Cu(I) MBT](n) complex film weakens due to its oxidative degradation with immersion time increasing.									15	0	0	0	0	0	15			1452-3981			WOS:000391039000072

However, photocatalytic water splitting without sacrificial agents is difficult due to the poor bulk charge separation and retarded surface reaction kinetics. Herein, we first combined the p-type Co3O4 cocatalysts with n-type ZnO@ZnS core-shell heterojunction to create a Co3O4-decorated ZnO@ZnS p-n junction by using bimetallic ZnCo-MOFs as template. In this hybrid, both the heterojunction and p-n junction can accelerate the bulk charge separation, while the highly dispersed Co3O4 cocatalysts can enhance the surface reaction kinetics. As a result, the outstanding H-2 and O-2 production rates of 3853 and 1927 mu mol g(-1) h(-1) were obtained for the optimal sample, approximately 1750, 550 and 110 times higher than those of ZnO, ZnO@ZnS and ZnO/Co3O4. Such synergistic enhancement can be evidenced by charge separation efficiency calculation. XAFS, XPS and DFT calculation indicated that the electrons and holes can be effectively assembled on ZnO and Co3O4, respectively. This work provides a new strategy for combining the advantages of cocatalyst and p-n junction as well as the core-shell heterojunction to enhance the photocatalytic water splitting without sacrificial agent.									39	2	0	0	2	0	40			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000543713600024

However, the effect of thiol additives on the air electrode has not yet been studied. The effect of solvated thiols on the surface positive electrode reaction is of prime importance if these are to be used in an iron-air battery. This work shows that the air-electrode catalyst is poisoned by the presence of octanethiol, with the oxygen reduction overpotential at the air electrode increasing with time of exposure to the solution and increased 1-octanethiol concentration in the range 0-0.1 mol dm(-3).Post-mortemXPS analyses were performed over the used air electrodes suggesting the adsorption of sulphur species over the catalyst surface, reducing its performance. Therefore, although sulphur-based additives may be suitable for nickel-iron batteries, they are not recommended for iron-air batteries except in concentrations well below 10 x 10(-3) mol dm(-3).									2	0	0	0	1	0	2			1432-8488	1433-0768		WOS:000544141300001

By monitoring the time evolution of the photoinduced excited state which is associated with the photocatalyzed dissociation of ethanol on Ti-5c sites of TiO2(110), the fractal-like kinetics of this surface photocatalytic reaction has been obtained. The measured photocatalytic dissociation rate on reduced TiO2(110) is faster than that on the oxidized surface. This is attributed to the larger defect density on the reduced surface which lowers the reaction barrier of the photocatalytic reaction at least methodologically. Possible reasons associated with the defect electrons for the acceleration have been discussed. By performing the interferometric two-pulse correlation on ethanol/TiO2(110) interface, the ultrafast electron dynamics of the excited state has been measured. The analyzed lifetime (24 fs) of the excited state is similar to that on methanol/TiO2(110). The appearance of the excited state provides a channel to mediate the electron transfer between the TiO2 substrate and its environment. Therefore studying its ultrafast electron dynamics may lead to the understanding of the microscopic mechanism of photocatalysis and photoelectrochemical energy conversion on TiO2.									9	4	0	0	2	0	9			1674-0068	1003-7713		WOS:000316093500001

Herein, we report the construction of F-doped Fe-N-C SSCs and the electron-withdrawing character of fluorine could stabilize Fe3+ sites, which promotes the FECO from the volcano-like highest value (88.2%@-0.40 V) to the high plateau (> 88.5%@-0.40--0.60 V), with a much-increased J(CO) (from 3.24 to 11.23 mA.cm(-2)). The enhancement is ascribed to the thermodynamically facilitated CO2RR and suppressed competing hydrogen evolution reaction, as well as the kinetically increased electroactive surface area and improved charge transfer, due to the stabilized Fe3+ sites and enriched defects by fluorine doping. This finding provides an efficient strategy to enhance the CO2RR performance of Fe-N-C SSCs by stabilizing Fe3+.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1998-0124	1998-0000		WOS:000805903200002

Here, we report the use of an epoxy-ended hyperbranched polymer (EHP) as a reactive template in an in situ preparation of porous NiCo2O4 on a pristine CNT film. The resultant porous NiCo2O4 has a core-shell nanostructure and possesses higher surface area and electrochemical performance in comparison to NiCo2O4 prepared without CNT film. As an electrode material, the CNT (2) NiCo2O4 film showed a high specific volume capacitance of 281.7 F cm(-3). The flexible symmetric supercapacitor assembled from the CNT(g) NiCo2O4 film displayed high volume capacitance (23.3 F cm(-3)), 95.6% retention in capacitance after 5000 charging-discharging cycles and bending performance, and high energy density (3.2 mWh cm(-3)). The CNT film served as a flexible current collector, and porous NiCo2O4 supplied high electrochemical performance. The reaction mechanism using the epoxy-ended hyperbranched polymer as a reactive template in the preparation of porous NiCo2O4 has been investigated using FT-IR, XRD, and TG.									9	0	0	0	0	0	9			2574-0962			WOS:000529190300102

To reuse brine, diaphragm type chlor-alkali experiments were carried out to make alkaline solution and gases. For this purpose, a rectangular acrylic reactor, 66.5 g/L of sodium chloride solution, a PTFE hydrophilic filter as asbestos free diaphragm, and IrO2 coated titanium net or plate electrode were used. The experimental results show that sodium hydroxide concentration and chloride removal increased with higher current density, and had inverse linear correlations to the increasing flow rate. The theoretical maximum sodium hydroxide concentration in effluent was estimated as 4.06%. Chloride removal and electric conductivity have a linear correlation with the sodium hydroxide concentration in effluent. Hydroxyl ion production was affected by the surface area of electrode per unit volume and by diaphragm pore size. Back-migration of hydroxyl ions from the cathode to anode is the major reason for side-reactions that cause low faradaic efficiency, including oxygen production in the anode compartment. Over 99% pure hydrogen was produced in the cathode compartment, and the current efficiency of hydrogen production was calculated as 92 - 99%.									7	0	0	0	2	0	7			1452-3981			WOS:000359200400024

EOP was realized when the Si/TiOx/Pt substrate was completely covered with the TiO2 film and a current efficiency of 7% was achieved at a low current density of 26.7 mA cm(-2) in 0.01 M HClO4 at 15 degrees C. The TiO2 film was found to be of an anatase-type TiO2 and that to comprise aperture structures from the X-ray diffraction (XRD) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) observations. Moreover. the fabricated TiO2 film was found to be an n-type semiconductor by photoelectrochemical measurements. The high efficiency at a low current density of EOP on the TiO2 n-type semiconductor was explained to result from the electron transfer through the TiO2/HClO4 interface as tunneling current. When the tunneling current passes through a depletion layer of TiO2, the electrode potential is necessarily high enough to facilitate EOP. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Here, we propose a new two-dimensional (2D) van der Waals type-II heterostructure based on C6N6/C2N composites as an efficient photocatalyst. The structural, electronic and optical properties of the free-standing monolayer as well as their heterostructure have been investigated by first principles based density functional theory (DFT). The band edge positions of C6N6/C2N heterostructures satisfy the photocatalytic water splitting requirements. The potential drop at the interface of the heterostructure induces a large built-in electric field directed from the C6N6 layer to the C2N layer, thereby facilitating the charge transfer from C2N to C6N6 layer. The higher hole mobility as compared to that of electrons aids in separation of charge carriers and thus prohibiting the recombination of the photogenerated charge carriers by separating them in different layers. This is also reflected in the planar averaged charge density difference and partial charge density calculation. The wide band gap semiconductor (C6N6) in combination with a moderate band gap semiconductor (C2N) allows one to harness solar energy efficiently in the visible region for water splitting as also confirmed in the optical absorption spectra. The favorable band edge position with respect to the water redox potential makes it an ideal substrate for the visible light induced oxygen evolution reaction and the hydrogen evolution reaction.									12	0	0	0	0	0	12			1463-9076	1463-9084		WOS:000620261000021	33543193

These microcapsules were obtained by the rapid hydrolysis of microdroplets of a solution of a mixture of NiSO4 and FeSO4 salts at the surface of an alkali solution. A hypothetical model of successive chemical processes occurring at the interface during synthesis is presented. The features of the "rim" formation around each microcapsule hole from the wall material with a peculiar nozzle-like shape are noted. These microcapsules can be transferred to the surface of a nickel foil using the Langmuir-Schaefer (LS) method. During the transfer process, they are fixed to the surface in an oriented position with a "rim" that contacts the nickel surface. It was established that electrodes made of such a foil with a layer of microcapsules exhibit active electrocatalytic properties in the oxygen evolution reaction during the electrolysis of water in an alkaline medium.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0				2504-5377		WOS:000817503300001

In this study, gaseous products generated from the pyrolysis of two low-rank coals were analyzed by an online home-built infrared detection system. The effect of heating rate and temperature on compositional distribution was considered and evaluated. Fourier transform infrared (FTIR), gas chromatograph/mass spectrometry (GC/MS), and Orbitrap-MS were employed to analyze other pyrolysis products such as raw coals, chars, and tars. In the pyrolysis process, oxygen-containing compounds in coal were the first species to participate in pyrolysis reactions. With the enhancement of temperature, the content of aromatic hydrocarbons showed an increasing trend, and the contents of aliphatic hydrocarbons and oxygenates decreased. In the four major pyrolysis gases, the yield of H-2 was the highest and the lowest for CO2. In addition, dynamic curves of the main pyrolysis gas were obtained, and the activation energies of pyrolysis gases were calculated by Ozawa-FlynnWall's (OFW) method. The possible generation pathways of gaseous products were proposed.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			0165-2370	1873-250X		WOS:000722026900001

Remelting these historical glasses in air at 1200 degrees C, the estimated temperature of medieval furnaces, revealed that these four glasses are more reduced before remelting. This favors Mn as weakly absorbing Mn2+, Fe as Fe2+ and Cu as colorless Cu+. Therefore Fe2+ is the second blue chromophore and copper was not intentionally used by glassmakers to obtain a blue color. A colorimetric analysis indicates that these specific melting conditions have a limited effect on the blue color of these glasses. Based on the spectroscopic determination of the redox state of Fe, Mn, and Cu, we estimate the oxygen partial pressure in medieval furnaces to be 10(-7)-10(-9) and 10(-5)bar for the potash- and soda-lime samples, respectively. The comparison with previous results enables to prove the evolution of furnace technology over centuries.									20	1	0	0	3	0	20			0002-7820	1551-2916		WOS:000368076800015

Herein, porous CuO micro-polyhedra assembled from numerous nanoparticles are synthesized simply by employing a Cu-based MOF as a precursor via a one-step calcination process under an air atmosphere. Benefitting from their high porosity and large specific surface area, porous CuO materials exhibit excellent electrocatalytic performances toward water oxidation in pH 9.2 KBi solution. A low catalytic onset potential at 1.05 V vs. NHE (NHE = normal hydrogen electrode) is obtained based on electrochemical measurements. A faradaic efficiency of nearly 98% and a stable catalytic current density of 2.2 mA cm(-2) are achieved under an applied potential of 1.30 V vs. NHE over an electrolysis period of 10 h. In addition, based on the Tafel plot, the required overpotentials are only similar to 410 mV and similar to 510 mV for achieving the catalytic current densities of 0.1 mA cm(-2) and 1.0 mA cm(-2), respectively. The excellent performances make it an appealing candidate as a potential catalyst for green energy applications.									40	2	0	0	2	0	40			2046-2069			WOS:000382482200028

The Gibbs free energy change of several key anodic reactions including electro-stripping of metals, electro-formation of metallic oxides, electro-dissolution of metallic oxides as well as oxygen and chlorine evolution was calculated and documented, for the first time, as a reference to develop metallic inert anode in chloride based melts. The anodic behaviors of typical metals (Ni, Fe, Co, Mo, Cu, Ag, and Pt) in the melt were investigated. The results confirmed the thermodynamic stability order of metals in the melts and revealed that surface oxide formation can increase the stability of the electrodes in CaO containing melt. Furthermore, solubility of several oxides (NiO, Fe2O3, Cr2O3, Co3O4, NiFe2O4) in pure CaCl2 or CaCl2-CaO melts was measured to evaluate the stability of oxide coating or a cermet inert anode in the melt. It was found that the solubility of NiO decreased with increasing CaO concentration, while that of Fe2O3 increased. Ni coated with NiO film had much higher stability during anodic polarization.

Porous covalent triazine frameworks (CTFs) have attracted considerable attention in gas adsorption and heterogeneous catalysis owing to their abundant nitrogen sites and very high thermal, chemical, and mechanical stability. In this work, a pyridine-based CTF (CTF-py, py = pyridine) derived from 2,6-dicyanopyridine is employed as a porous platform to anchor the Re carbonyl complex Re(CO)(3)Cl (Re-CTF-py), which exhibits high efficiency in the photocatalytic CO2 reduction to CO with a turnover number (TON) of 4.8; the CO evolution rate for Re-CTF-py reached 353.05 mu mol g(-1) h(-1) within 10 hours under full light irradiation in a solid-gas system. Moreover, in the solid-gas system, the single-site Re-CTF-py catalyst could prevent Re active species dimerization and leaching that lead to deactivation. This work highlights the great potential of using stable CTFs as porous platforms to anchor single active sites for heterogeneous catalysis.									76	5	0	0	6	0	77			2044-4753	2044-4761		WOS:000433517700023

The formed two-dimensional heterostructure could enhance the interfacial contact area between BCN and porous g-C3N4 as well as shorten the photogenerated charge carriers transfer time and distance. The two-dimensional g-C3N4/BCN heterojunction photoanode shows enhanced photoelectrochemical (PEC) performance for water splitting under visible-light irradiation, which primarily originates from the improved charge transfer and separation, and prolonged lifetime of electrons. Under the visible light irradiation, the g-C3N4/BCN heterojunction sample yields a photocurrent density of similar to 0.62 mA cm(-2) at 1.23 V vs. RHE, which is about eight times as many as that of CN (0.08 mA cm(-2)) electrode at the same conditions. In addition, the possible electron transfer model and mechanism of PEC water splitting for H-2 evolution have been discussed. (C) 2019 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) have been used to characterize the as-synthesized silver products. The results show that a variety of silver nanostructures, such as silver dendrites, the triangular, hexagonal, disk nanoplates and spherical nanoparticles, can be yielded in large scale by facilely tuning the silver nitrate concentrations, temperature and concentration of PVP in aqueous solutions. The as-synthesized silver dendrites were deposited in ethanol without any field (UV or visible light irradiation) or thermally induced activation, a significantly spontaneous evolution in morphology occurred from the fractal structure to silver nanoparticles at room temperature. Moreover, the mechanisms of the architectural reconstruction of silver nanostructures in ethanol at room temperature by self-assemble were discussed. The proposed dissolution recrystallization process induced by ethanol may be responsible for the morphological reconstructure of the as-synthesized Ag dendrites. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

In this work, ultrafine cobalt oxide (CoOx) co-catalysts with specific Co valence states have been successfully synthesized, which are anchored on a tantalum oxynitride (TaON) host photocatalyst via a photochemical metal-organic deposition method. Photoelectrochemical and photoluminescence analyses prove that the Co2+ dominant CoOx co-catalyst is favorable for charge separation and transportation because of its excellent hole-capturing properties, consequently enhancing the photocatalytic water oxidation performance. The resultant TaON with the Co2+ dominant CoOx co-catalyst exhibits an outstanding O-2 production rate up to 6.10 +/- 0.17 mmol h(-1) g(-1) and possesses an excellent apparent quantum efficiency of 21.2% at 420 nm, which are among the best values of water-oxidation photocatalysts.									6	1	0	0	1	0	6			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000664226100001

Nanotechnology											10.1088/1361-6528/ac9c0a				2022-Oct-20	2022	Exploration of high-performance photoanodes is considered as an essential challenge in photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting due to the complex four-electron reaction in water oxidation. Herein, the nano-structured WO3-Se heterojunction decorated by organic Nafion layer is designed. The optimized WO3-Se200-0.05Nafion photoanode shows a remarkable photocurrent of 1.40 mA cm-2 at 1.23 V vs. Reversible Hydrogen Electrode (RHE), which is 2.5-fold higher than that of pure WO3 nanosheets (WO3 NS) photoelectrode. Remarkably, the photocurrent increments of WO3-Se200-0.05Nafion is larger than the increment sum of WO3-Se200 and WO3-0.05Nafion, which affirming the synergistic effect of Se nanospheres and Nafion layer. The improved PEC performances are attributed to the quick charge separation and transfer, the increased electric conductivity, and the excellent kinetics of oxygen evolution, which is derived from the strong interaction among WO3, Se and Nafion. Meanwhile, the better visible-light harvesting from Se nanospheres as photosensitizer and the induction of transparent Nafion as a passivation layer can explain this synergy. It hopes this heterostructure design with organic Nafion decoration can inspire to exploit outstanding performance photoanodes for PEC water splitting.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0				1361-6528		MEDLINE:36265458	36265458

However, bulk TMNs usually suffer from limited numbers of active sites and sluggish ionic kinetics, and eventually ordinary electrochemical performance. Designing nanostructured TMNs with tailored morphology and good dispersity has proved an effective strategy to address these issues, which provides a larger specific surface area, more abundant active sites, and shorter ion and mass transport distances over the bulk counterparts. Herein, the most up-to-date progress on TMN-based nanomaterials is comprehensively reviewed, focusing on geometric-structure design, electronic-structure engineering, and applications in electrochemical energy conversion and storage, including electrocatalysis, supercapacitors, and rechargeable batteries.

Therefore, an accurate location of single atoms is essential for understanding the reaction mechanism and design of SACs anchored at 2D layered materials. However, the preparation of SACs with a precise location remains a great challenge. This review highlights recent advances in the preparation, characterization, and catalytic performance of SACs, focusing on single atoms anchored at 2D layered materials beyond graphene. These 2D materials include transitional metal dichalcogenides, layered double hydroxides, and MXenes. Importantly, the topic of impurities is discussed because these can be present at an even higher percentage than the single atoms at 2D layered materials. A variety of electrochemical energy applications are discussed in which SACs have a crucial role, including water splitting and carbon dioxide reduction. Finally, this review provides the latest applications and developments perspective of single metal atoms on 2D surfaces, which offers a unique opportunity to tune active sites and optimize the activity, selectivity, and stability of electrocatalysts.									53	3	0	0	2	0	53			2155-5435			WOS:000563749900056

In this work, an Ag-g-C3N4/W18O49 heterojunction catalyst is prepared and used for full-spectrum-driven N-2 photofixation from the UV to the NIR region for the first time. X-ray diffraction, N-2 adsorption, UV-Vis-NIR spectroscopy, thermogravimetric analysis, photoluminescence, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and electrochemical impedance spectra were used to characterize the prepared catalysts. The result indicates that the as- prepared Ag-g-C3N4/W18O49 heterojunction catalysts display much higher N-2 photofixation performance than that of individual W18O49 or Ag-g-C3N4, which should be due to the better separation rate of electron- hole pairs and more efficient light utilization. g-C3N4 is the active component in the catalyst for N-2 photofixation. Ag loading promotes the separation rate of electron-hole pairs. W18O49 plays a role as light absorber in the full-spectrum to form more photogenerated electrons for recombining the holes in the g-C3N4 through "Z-scheme" mechanism. A possible electrons transfer route is proposed.									10	1	0	0	2	0	11			2046-2069			WOS:000409548200040

A boron-doped diamond electrode was modified with nickel nanoparticles by electrodeposition. Various electrodeposition charges were used to deposit nanoparticles of different sizes onto the electrode. Afterward, the nickel nanoparticle modified boron-doped diamond electrodes were initially oxidized in NaOH solution to form beta-Ni(OH)(2) on the surface. Further oxidation forms the Ni(2+/3+) redox couple, beta-Ni(OH)(2)/beta-NiOOH, which catalyzes lactic acid oxidation. Studies in the absence and in the presence of lactic acid were performed and compared to the behavior of the Ni(2+/3+) redox couple on a bulk nickel electrode. The anodic peak was greater than the cathodic peak current in both situations and attributed to the catalytic effect of NiOOH on the oxidation of lactic acid. The ratio between the anodic and cathodic peaks was normalized to the amount of the Ni((2+/3+)) couple on the electrode, and it was found that for suitably small nickel nanoparticles (diameter = 31.8 +/- 7.0 nm) authentic catalytic behavior was seen when compared to a bulk nickel electrode.									13	0	0	0	2	0	13			1932-7447	1932-7455		WOS:000351970800047

The catalytic activities in the diesel soot oxidation were tested by using temperature-programmed oxidation(TPO) reaction apparatus. The results show that all of the Zr4+ incorporated into the CeO2 lattice to form a solid solution. On the other hand, Fe3+ is extremely difficult to dissolve into the CeO2 lattice, and some Fe2O3 disperses on the surface of solid solution. The partial substitution of Ce4+ with Zr4+ and/or Fe3+ strongly improves the aging resistance of the catalysts. The strong synergetic effect between free Fe2O3 and surface oxygen vacancies wearies believed to have a pronounced positive effect on catalyst activity towards soot oxidation.

Herein, a facile electrodeposition strategy followed by wet-chemistry treatment is reported for the fabrication of the ultralow amount loading of ruthenium (Ru) on CoMo alloy supported on carbon fiber paper (CFP) substrate (RuCoMo/CFP). Benefiting from the unique nano-architectures and synergetic effect of loading Ru material and CoMo alloy, the optimized Ru-CoMo/CFP exhibits excellent electrocatalytic activity and favourable stability toward electrochemical water splitting. The as-prepared Ru-CoMo/CFP composite exhibits a current density of 10 mA.cm(-2) at overpotentials of 44 and 237 mV for catalyzing hydrogen and oxygen evolution reaction (HER/ OER) in alkaline medium, respectively. The as-synthetized Ru-CoMo/CFP electrode is also demonstrated to function as anode and cathode, simultaneously, only needs a cell voltage of 1.54 V to yield 10 mA.cm(-2), outperforming the state-of-the-art RuO2 parallel to Pt/C couple (1.56 V). This work demonstrates substantial improvement in the design of high-efficiency electrodes for water electrolysis.									9	0	0	0	0	0	9			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000628759000001

The most effective model systems for RNA copying have to date required a high concentration of Mg2+. Recently, Fe2+, which was abundant on the prebiotic anoxic Earth, was shown to promote the folding of RNA in a manner similar to the case of Mg2+, as a result of the two cations having similar interactions with phosphate groups. These observations raise the question of whether Fe2+ could have promoted RNA copying on the prebiotic Earth. Here, we demonstrate that Fe2+ is a better catalyst and promotes faster nonenzymatic RNA primer extension and ligation than Mg2+ when using 2-methylimidazole activated nucleotides in slightly acidic to neutral pH solutions. Thus, it appears likely that Fe2+ could have facilitated RNA replication and evolution in concert with other metal cations on the prebiotic Earth.									11	0	0	0	9	0	11			0002-7863			WOS:000449887800062	30335371

Molecular- level interactions between ionic solutes and solvent molecules - commonly referred to as solvation phenomena - give rise to many functional properties of electrolytes such as ionic conductivity, viscosity, and stability. It is critical to understand the evolution of solvation phenomena as a function of competing counterions and solvent mixtures to predict and design the optimal electrolyte for a target application. Probing oxygen environments is of great interest as oxygens are located at strategic molecular sites in battery solvents and are directly involved in inter- and intramolecular solvation interactions. NMR signals from O-17 nuclei in battery electrolytes offer nondestructive bulk measurements of isotropic shielding, electric field gradient tensors, and transverse and longitudinal relaxation rates, which are excellent means for probing structure, bonding, and dynamics of both solute and solvent molecules. This article describes the use of O-17 NMR spectroscopy in probing the solvation structures of various electrolyte systems ranging from transition metal ions in aqueous solution to lithium cations in organic solvent mixtures.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			2055-6101			WOS:000396611600005

Engineering an efficient, low-cost photocatalyst is necessary to achieve this technological goal. A photocatalyst combines a photosensitiser and an electrocatalyst to capture light and accelerate the chemical reactions in the same device. In this perspective paper, we first describe the recent developments of some families of semiconductors that are attractive candidates for engineering photocatalysts. We then discuss the use of semiconductors as light harvesting agents, combined with a bio-catalyst, synthetic bio-mimetic molecular catalyst or synthetic all-inorganic catalyst, in photocatalytic hybrid systems for water splitting and CO2 reduction. To highlight the advantages of semiconductors for engineering efficient and robust photocatalysts, we compare these systems to examples of homogeneous photocatalytic systems constructed from molecular photosensitisers (dyes). We conclude that all-inorganic catalysts coupled to appropriate semiconductors look more promising for the construction of robust photocatalytic hybrid systems for producing solar fuels.									482	19	1	0	51	0	490			1754-5692	1754-5706		WOS:000300710600003

Photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting is a promising means of obtaining renewable hydrogen directly from water utilizing sunlight. Recent reports have demonstrated that a PEC cell with a tandem configuration (tandem cell) has the potential to realize a high solar-to-hydrogen (STH) energy conversion efficiency by solar water splitting. However, there are still many obstacles to the development of practical and cost-effective tandem cells. In particular, development of efficient photoanodes for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is a prerequisite for improving the STH efficiency. Herein, recent progress in developing (semi)transparent photoanodes for the OER, such as Fe2O3, BiVO4, and Ta3N5, is described based on the topics of preparation methods, semiconductor properties, and PEC performance. In addition, the strategies for enhancing the STH efficiency of tandem cells consisting of (semi)transparent photoanodes conjugated with photovoltaic (PV)-based cathodes are summarized. This Review is expected to provide guidelines for the future development of tandem cells capable of highly efficient and stable water splitting.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			2699-9412			WOS:000783860200006

Herein, novel fiber-in-tube hierarchical nanofibers composed of defect-rich NiCo2O4-delta@C bubbles (DBHF) are constructed as the HZB cathode. The nanoscale bimetal oxide bubbles with a defective structure are surrounded by a porous carbon network, which connect with each other and assemble a fiber-in-tube hierarchical configuration. The DBHF nanofiber not only provides a highly porous and conductive skeleton for fast electron/ion transport, but also possesses rich active sites to accelerate oxygen reduction/evolution reactions (ORR/OER). Benefitting from both electrochemical and electrocatalytic properties, the fabricated HZB with the DBHF cathode exhibits a high operating voltage, fast kinetics and high energy density. In addition, the two-set charge/discharge curves during long-term cycles further demonstrate its good stability and high efficiency. More impressively, the wide environmental adaptation and excellent "air-charging" capability make the prepared flexible hybrid Zn battery an uninterrupted power source for flexible electronics under different working conditions. Therefore, this work provides a novel high-performance cathode for HZBs and propels the development of flexible batteries towards multiple applications.									9	0	0	0	2	0	9			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000551538000010

A new category of catalysts with the integration of both aspects has been rapidly developed in recent years, and significant advantages were established to make it an independent research field. In this Review, we will focus on the concept of two-dimensional materials confining single atoms for catalysis. The new electronic states via the integration lead to their mutual benefits in activity, that is, two-dimensional materials with unique geometric and electronic structures can modulate the catalytic performance of the confined single atoms, and in other cases the confined single atoms can in turn affect the intrinsic activity of two-dimensional materials. Three typical two-dimensional materials are mainly involved here, i.e., graphene, g-C3N4, and MoS2, and the confined single atoms include both metal and nonmetal atoms. First, we systematically introduce and discuss the classic synthesis methods, advanced characterization techniques, and various catalytic applications toward two-dimensional materials confining single-atom catalysts. Finally, the opportunities and challenges in this emerging field are featured on the basis of its current development.									483	32	0	0	29	0	484			0009-2665	1520-6890		WOS:000459223100005	30575386

Although photocatalytic N-2 fixation with water under ambient conditions is ideal, all previously reported catalysts show low efficiency. Here, we report that a metal-free organic semiconductor could provide a new basis for photocatalytic N-2 fixation. We show that phosphorus-doped carbon nitride containing surface nitrogen vacancies (PCN-V), prepared by simple thermal condensation of the precursors under H-2, produces NH3 from N-2 with water under visible light irradiation. The doped P atoms promote water oxidation by the photoformed valence-band holes, and the N vacancies promote N-2 reduction by the conduction-band electrons. These phenomena facilitate efficient N-2 fixation with a solar-to-chemical conversion (SCC) efficiency of 0.1%, which is comparable to the average solar-to-biomass conversion efficiency of natural photosynthesis by typical plants. Thus, this metal-free catalyst shows considerable potential as a new method of artificial photosynthesis.									67	1	0	0	2	0	67			2574-0962			WOS:000458706400075

The influence of current density and mean linear flow velocity on the As removal efficiency was analyzed. Groundwater was collected from deep well (320 m deep) located in Guanajuato, Mexico (arsenic 50 mu g L-1, carbonates 40 mg L-1, hardness 80 mg L-1, pH 7.5 and conductivity 150 mu S cm(-1)). Prior to EC experiments arsenite contained in groundwater was oxidized to arsenate by addition of 1 mg L-1 hypochlorite typically used for disinfection. Arsenate removal by EC might involve adsorption on aluminum hydroxides generated in the process. Arsenate depletion from 50 to 3.9 mu g L-1 was obtained at current density and mean linear flow velocity of 6 mA cm(-2) and 1.8 cm s(-1), respectively, with energy consumption of 3.9 kWh m(-3). The convenience of using the FM01-LC cell as a test reactor, which avoids oxygen evolution reaction during the aluminum electrodissolution, is also discussed.									20	0	0	0	5	0	20			1452-3981			WOS:000345261800066

Single-atom catalysts (SACs) and dual-metal-sites catalysts (DMSCs) with high activity and selectivity are superior electrocatalysts for the CO2RR as they have higher active site utilization and lower cost than traditional noble metals. Herein, we explore a rational and creative density-functional-theory-based, machine-learning-accelerated (DFT-ML) method to investigate the CO2RR catalytic activity of hundreds of transition metal phthalocyanine (Pc) DMSCs. The gradient boosting regression (GBR) algorithm is verified to be the most desirable ML model and is used to construct catalytic activity prediction, with a root-mean-square error of only 0.08 eV. The results of ML prediction demonstrate Ag-MoPc as a promising CO2RR electrocatalyst with the limiting potential of only -0.33 V. The DFT-ML hybrid scheme accelerates the efficiency 6.87 times, while the prediction error is only 0.02 V, and it sheds light on the path to accelerate the rational design of efficient catalysts for energy conversion and conservation.									23	0	0	0	1	0	22			1948-7185			WOS:000672734200013	34170687

In this work, freestanding nitrogen/sulfur co-doped porous carbon (NSPC) membranes were fabricated facilely by carbonizing the electrostatically cross-linked complexes, composed of hydrophobic poly(ionic liquid) (PIL) and alginic acid (AA). The newly-fabricated NSPC membranes can be used directly as the electrodes for the electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and supercapacitors in the absence of any binding agents/additives. Outstandingly, NSPC-9 presented a specific capacitance (C-s) as high as 969 F g(-1) at the current density of 0.1 A g(-1). Additionally, NSPC-9 also delivered excellent HER electrocatalytic performance. In particular, a current density of 10 mA cm(-1) could be achieved at a low overpotential of 146 mV, and a small Tafel slope of 64 mV dec(-1) could be presented. Benefiting from their large surface area, moderate N/S dopants and good electron/electrolyte transport ability, as well as low cost and convenient synthesis procedure, NSPCs are promising electrode materials and have great potential applications in electrocatalysis and supercapacitors.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			1144-0546	1369-9261		WOS:000653661000001

However, the characteristics of radical for judging its ability to oxidize are still poorly understood. The electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy has emerged as a powerful approach in studying the behavior of radicals. So the EPR spectra of coal low-temperature oxidation were investigated by in-situ EPR spectroscopy. Analysis of the initial temperature of CO evolution and its increment and crossing-point temperatures (CPTs) of coal reveal that the oxidizability of low-rank coal is more prominent than others. The EPR linear profile of low-rank coal has a well temperature dependence and a large g factor, an indicator of oxidizability. However, it is not consistent with the increasing trend of the absolute content of radical concentration. This study provides a novel approach to quantify the oxidizability of coal using the relative growth rate R of radials, and the results are consistent with the coal spontaneous combustion tendency. The main objective of the current study is to obtain a comprehensive understanding of low-temperature oxidation of coal with different ranks.									13	0	0	0	0	0	13			0016-2361	1873-7153		WOS:000634758500003

The characterization of the material was carried out by SEM and XRD techniques, and the performance of the TinO_(2n-1) electrode was investigated using an electrochemical test method. Moreover, an organic pollutant treatment experiment was designed to investigate the electrocatalytic oxidation performance of the electrode. Results showed that the homemade porous TinO_(2n-1) electrode possessed the main phase of Ti407. The as - prepared TinO_(2n-1) porous electrode and the graphite electrode were tested by electrochemical methods.

However, little success has been achieved to optimize this process, restricted by the poor understanding. Herein, taking photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting over a titanium dioxide (TiO2) nanorod-array electrode as a model system, experiments were performed to study single oxygen bubble dynamics by combining electrochemical measurement and high-speed microscopic imaging. The experimental results indicate that the departure of bubble from photo-electrode is retarded by light irradiation, but the traditional bubble departure criterions fail to predict the bubble departure diameters especially in high light intensity. Additional analysis reveals that the light irradiation causes the Marangoni force acting on the evolving bubble, because it induces temperature rise and generates dissolved gas. A modified force balance model for bubble departure from photoelectrode was developed by adding Marangoni force. This modified model that takes account of the light-induced temperature rise and the dissolved gas, agrees well with the experimental data and can be extended to other photo(electro) catalytic reactions.

The morphologies and properties of the 3D Co-P nanosphere arrays can be controlled by the electrolyte concentration. At the middle concentration, Co-P nanospheres have a more homogeneous size and array distribution and a rough surface, implying a larger surface area and an increased number of active sites for water splitting. The electrochemical measurements confirm the best electrocatalytic performances of Co-P/FTO at the middle concentration. They show excellent activity, with an overpotential of 125 mV for HER, 420 mV for OER and Tafel slopes of 54 mV dec(-1) and 83 mV dec(-1), respectively. The fabricated bifunctional systems of Co-P/Co-P can efficiently catalyse HER and OER at the same time, solving the incompatible problem of different media between HER and OER. Therefore, controlling the synthesis of 3D Co-P/FTO nanosphere arrays through electrodeposition can provide a facile way for the bifunctional electrocatalysis of both HER and OER.									43	2	0	0	2	0	43			2046-2069			WOS:000378563200032

Cubic, orthorhombic, and hexagonal structures of NiSe2, CoSe2, and CoNiSe2 were confirmed by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and also by other characterization studies. Perfect nanospheres, combination of distorted nanospheres and tiny nanoparticles, and sharp-edge nanostructures of NiSe2, CoSe2, and CoNiSe2 were explored by surface morphological images. Higher OER activity of the binary CoNiSe2 electrode was achieved as 188 mA/g current density with a comparatively low overpotential of 234 mV along with higher conductivity and low charge transfer resistance when compared to its unary NiSe2 and CoSe2 electrodes. A low Tafel slope value of 82 mV/dec was also achieved for the same binary CoNiSe2 electrode in a half-cell configuration. The overall 100% retention achieved for all of the fabricated electrodes in a stability test of OER activity suggested that the excellent optimum condition was obtained during the synthesis. This could definitely be a revelation in the synthesis of novel binary combinations of affordable metal selenides for clean energy production.									10	0	0	0	0	0	10			2470-1343			WOS:000543740600052	32596607

Due to their limited availability and high cost, recent research has focused on the development of earth abundant, low cost, eco-friendly and non-precious catalysts. Towards this goal, this work aims to the study the effect of Ni doping in Mn3O4 for OER in alkaline medium. Mn3O4 and Ni doped Mn3O4 were synthesized through a simple CTAB assisted co-precipitation reaction followed by calcination. The physical and chemical properties associated with the catalytic activity of the samples were investigated. The results suggest that an optimum of 10 wt% Ni doped Mn3O4 exhibits better catalytic activity compared to pure Mn3O4.

The laboratory prototype, consisting of ten independent porous graphite slices each of 5 mm thickness, can be adapted by external electrical connection to allow both traditional and sectioned operations to be run in a single device. The experimental study in this work focuses on use of the multisectioned arrangement to improve current-distribution uniformity in the porous-electrode reactor. A model electrosynthesis system, consisting of oxidation of sodium gluconate to D-arabinose in competition with the parallel reaction of oxygen evolution, has been chosen for investigation. Measurements in the sectioned electrode show that the performance, expressed in terms of current efficiency for gluconate oxidation, increases Significantly with an increase in the number of sections. A comparison of predicted theoretical performance with experimental measurements on the ten-section prototype has been used to extrapolate the performance of the sectioned electrode to configurations with larger numbers of sections. Extrapolation indicates that optimal performance in the 5 cm electrode can be achieved with fewer than 100 sections, a design that is feasible to construct with modem microfabrication technology.

Alkaline water electrolysis is a wellestablished technology with relatively low costs which does not require scarce noble metal catalysts, but it suffers from low current densities. Increasing the operating temperature can allow this limitation to be overcome. This article summarizes both long-standing and recent developments in alkaline water electrolysis at increased temperature and sheds light on the challenges and unique opportunities of this approach. It is found that electrochemical improvements induced by higher temperature enable competitive current densities and offer unique possibilities for thermal management. The selection and development of stable materials, catalysts, and diaphragms is challenging, but some have proven long-term stability up to at least 150 degrees C and promising candidates are available at up to 200 degrees C. Further research will allow the present challenges to be overcome by understanding and improving the basic processes and components for alkaline electrolysis at increased temperature and capitalizing on its unique advantages.									4	0	0	0	1	0	4			0013-4651	1945-7111		WOS:000717274400001

However, because the Zeeman energy is several orders of magnitude weaker, magnetic field seems unable to alter the band structure and has a negligible effect on semiconductor photocatalytic performance, which makes this task a great challenge. On the other hand, the spin-related behavior usually plays an important role in determining catalytic performance. For example, in some molecular catalysis, such as photosystem II, ferromagnetic alignment of the active material results in spin-oriented electrons, which are selected and accumulated at the interface, leading to great promotion of the oxygen evolution reaction activity. Here, we propose a magnetoresistance-related strategy to boost the carrier transfer efficiency and apply it in alpha-Fe2O3/reduced graphene oxide hybrid nanostructures (alpha-Fe2O3/rGO) to improve the photocatalytic performance under magnetic field. We show that both the degradation rate constant and photocurrent density of alpha-Fe2O3/rGO can be dramatically enhanced with the application of magnetic field, indicating the promotion of the photocatalytic performance.									126	1	0	0	17	0	126			1936-0851	1936-086X		WOS:000431088200031	29611413

Slag-steel reaction will lead to a large change of steel compositions and slag properties when molten steel is refined by the traditional high SiO2 slags, and also affect the cleanness of liquid steel. According to the analysis on the characteristics of refining process and continuous casting, new refining slag and tundish covering powder were developed for the high Al steel, and the cleanness was improved with the [Si] and [Al] contents being controlled accurately. The mold powder with high basicity and vitrification was also developed to guarantee the slag stability after absorbing alumina inclusions. Stable continuous casting can be carried out by using slag washing, controlling the inclusion morphology, and using seal ring and argon blowing in continuous casting process. The practical operation shows that when the [Si], [Al] and [S] contents are 0.25%-0.40%, 0.80%-1.00%, and below 0.004%, respectively, more than 6 heats of 38CrMoAl can be continuously casted with the total oxygen and nitrogen contents lower than 15 ppm and 50 ppm respectively.					5th International Symposium on High-Temperature Metallurgical Processing held during 143rd TMS Annual Meeting and Exhibition5th International Symposium on High-Temperature Metallurgical Processing held during 143rd TMS Annual Meeting and Exhibition	FEB 16-20, 2014FEB 16-20, 2014	Minerals Metals & Mat SocMinerals Metals & Mat Soc	San Diego, CASan Diego, CA	0	0	0	0	0	0	0					978-1-118-88799-8; 978-1-118-88811-7	WOS:000356714000025

Along with ZnFe2O4 for visible light absorption, we designed a novel heterojunction photoelectrode using upconversion nanoparticles (UCNPs) with near-infrared (NIR) light absorption to improve solar absorption efficiency. We fabricated a UCNP-decorated ZnFe2O4/TiO2 photocatalyst (UCNPs-ZFO/TiO2) by sequentially drop-casting ZFO nanoparticles and UCNPs onto TiO2 nanopillars grown on a transparent fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) substrate. The UCNP-ZFO/TiO2 exhibited a significantly higher photocurrent density of 0.795 mA cm(-2) compared to that of the pristine TiO2 (0.260 mA cm(-2)). The applied bias photon-to-current efficiency of UCNP-ZFO/TiO2 was 4.1 times higher than that of TiO2, and its photoanode had the lowest charge transfer resistance and highest charge density among the prepared photoelectrodes. This implies that the combination of UCNPs and ZFO on the TiO2 photoanode can be an effective strategy to significantly improve photoelectrochemical performance owing to the synergetic utilization of NIR light by UCNPs and that of visible light by the ZFO nanoparticles.									5	0	0	0	1	0	5			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000779681800002

Herein, BiOBr atomic-layered quantum dots (QDs) with abundant edge coordinatively unsaturated sites (CUS) was fabricated to tackle the aforementioned problems. The resulting BiOBr have a thickness equivalent to a single unit cell and have only 3-5 nm in width, which is the smallest value of all reported BiOBr materials. Our pioneering study discloses that the valence band minimum (VBM) and conduction band maximum (CBM) of atomic-layered BiOBr QDs are spatially separated. Therefore, on irradiation, holes are directly generated on the basal surfaces and electrons on the edge sites, leading to ultrafast charge separation. The edges expose a huge number of adsorption sites for oxygen molecules. As a results, the electrons on the edge sites are able to directly reduce the absorbed O-2 molecules to exhibit strengthened photocatalytic .O2- production. We also firstly demonstrate that BiOBr atomic-layered QDs are an excellent candidate for anticancer applications, which is attributed to enhanced .O2- production activity. This study provides an in-depth understanding on the design of advanced photocatalysts via edge unsaturated coordinated sites engineering on the atomic scale.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000801821000001

This research found that the challenge could be overcome using S inherently existing in the raw material for production of C2H4 and conventionally considered as a catalyst poison. Specifically, the sulfur-containing Cu2O catalysts are superior to the sulfur-free Cu2O catalysts in two dimensions, one is the improvement of C2H4 formation activity and selectivity; the other is to reduce green oil precursor formation. The microscopic mechanism of S lies in blocking larger active region required for C2H2 polymerization and C2H4 hydrogenation to ethane; whereas without affecting smaller active region needed for C2H2 hydrogenation to C2H4.

However, not-yet-available long-term stability of photoelectrodes inhibits their practical application. Introducing structure tunable, highly active and easily prepared molecular catalysts is an efficient approach to improve their stability and has recently attracted great attention. Nonetheless, the long-term stability is still challenged due to regeneration of molecular catalyst during stability test. Herein, tannic acid coordinated with Ni and Fe ions (TANF) molecular catalyst is immobilized on BiVO4 photoanode for oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Taking advantage of the regeneration of molecular catalyst, effects of buffer species on activity, stability and regeneration of TANF/BiVO4 photoanodes are investigated. In an optimal borate electrolyte, the TANF/BiVO4 photoanode shows nearly no-decay after operating at harsh conditions (at 1.2 V-RHE with continuous light illumination) for 62 h. The long-term stability profits from the regenerated catalyst, which is composed of a carbon conductive network with metal oxides/hydroxides as OER-active sites. This excellent stability of the integrated photoanode surpasses most of existing OEC/BiVO4 photoanodes, and the stabilized catalyst is comparable with the state-of-the-art FeOOH/NiOOH dual-cocatalyst and ferrihydrite catalyst.									16	0	0	0	0	0	16			2211-2855	2211-3282		WOS:000521052900036

The transition from tetragonal phase to pseudo cubic phase at 0.02 <= x <= 0.04 was observed in Raman spectra and X-ray diffraction patterns. As the BSN contents increased, the grain size increased. With adding Bi(Sr2/3Nb1/3)O-3, the thermal stability of permittivity and dielectric loss of ceramics got a good optimization. Especially, 0.9BT-0.1BSN ceramics have small Delta epsilon/epsilon(25 degrees C) values (<= +/- 15%) in a wide temperature range of -75 degrees C to 153 degrees C, high relative permittivity (-1505 to 1700) and low dielectric loss (tan delta <= 0.02) from - 88 degrees C to 200 degrees C, showing that BT-BSN ceramics are suitable for using in MLCCs of X8R. Impedance spectroscopy was analyzed the conduction and relaxation processes. The results showed that the relaxation and the conduction process in the high temperature region are thermally activated, and the oxygen vacancies are charge carriers.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			0921-5107	1873-4944		WOS:000457507500017

Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared spectra (FT-IR), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and X-ray energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) indicate the successful intercalation of vanadate and molybdate anions. According to the results obtained from TEM and XRD, LDHs have a size in the nanometer scale with a plate-like morphology and high crystalline quality. Moreover, the LDHs were used as an efficient electrocatalyst material for water oxidation in alkali solution. In electrochemical water splitting, Zn-Fe-VO4 shows a superior OER performance compared to the bare glassy carbon electrode. Zn-Fe-VO4-LDH exhibits good OER activity, which is expressed as a low onset overpotential, small Tafel slope, and large exchange current density. At the overpotential of 0.46 (V vs. SCE), the current density of the Zn-Fe-VO4-LDH nanosheets is about 188.43 mA cm(-2), which is much higher than that of the Zn-Fe-MoO4-LDH and Zn-Fe-NO3-LDH nanoparticles.									47	4	0	0	6	0	48			1144-0546	1369-9261		WOS:000424970300064

The complexity of this research field is limited ultimately by the lack of a facile and practicable strategy to synthesize well-defined ultrathin amorphous nanomaterials. Here, for the first time, we report the random attachment of Co-3(PO4)(2) amorphous nanoplate building blocks into ultrathin nanosheets with dimensions on the micrometer scale. We found the structure of obtained Co-3(PO4)(2) amorphous nanosheet can be converted into nanowire by a split process. On the basis of our observations, an assemble-split mechanism for synthesizing ultrathin amorphous nanostructure is proposed. Furthermore, our strategy is general and can be used to prepare other metal phosphate amorphous ultrathin nanostructures. As a demonstration, the synthesized Co-3(PO4)(2) ultrathin nanowire has been proven to show extraordinary performance as an electrode material for a pseudocapacitor with the specific capacitance of up to 1174 F g(-1), which is much higher than that of crystalline cobalt phosphate and even comparable to that of cobaltous hydroxide nanomaterials.									61	3	0	0	1	0	62			0897-4756	1520-5002		WOS:000371852000016

The eddy flow characteristics and mass transfer mechanism in the reactor are analyzed by numerical simulation and experiment. The results show that the evolution law of Taylor vortex in a stirred tank reactor with a rotating Reynolds number is similar to that in a conventional Taylor reactor. The Taylor vortex generated in the stirred tank reactor creates a partial plug flow region in the original complete mixing flow pattern, which reduces back mixing, the plug flow area expands with the increase of rotating Reynolds number. Under the condition of a critical rotating Reynolds number (Re-cr), the gas phase homogeneity of the reactor is increased by 28% and the dissolved oxygen rate is increased by about 5 times, which effectively improves the flow condition in the reactor and strengthens the mass transfer efficiency between the gas and liquid. The research results provide a theoretical basis for breaking through the limitation of small reaction space of conventional Taylor flow reactor and expanding production scale. The refit of kettle reactor is universal and easy to operate.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0				1996-1073		WOS:000775456800001

Here, to take full advantage of the strong metal-support interaction (SMSI), Pd nanoparticles (NPs, similar to 4.1 nm) were in situ reduced onto the TiO2 surface of a TiO2-C heterostructure by photo-generated electrons under light irradiation. By means of experimental characterization studies, electron transfer from the support (TiO2-C heterostructure) to Pd NPs results in an electron-rich Pd surface and a downshift in the d-band structure. A photochemical strategy strengthens the SMSI effect and hence improves the catalytic activity and durability of the Pd catalyst. Compared with commercial Pd/C (Com. Pd/C, 10.0 wt%) and Pd/TiO2 (22.0 wt%) catalysts, as-prepared Pd/TiO2-C (7.2 wt%) shows excellent ORR activity with MA up to 0.16 A mg(Pd)(-1) at 0.9 V. The results demonstrate that for metal oxide supports with photocatalytic activity, the photochemical route is conducive to the formation of the SMSI effect between the metal and support, thus improving the activity and durability of the metal catalyst.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			1144-0546	1369-9261		WOS:000698169400001

Due to maximum atom utilization efficiency and tunable electronic structures, SACs exhibit highly distinctive catalytic performance from bulk counterparts. SACs with high metal loading will facilitate practical applications. To that end, this Review focuses on recent strategies to maximize metal loading. An appropriate substrate, mainly heteroatom-doped carbon materials, is the key to avoiding aggregation or sintering during synthetic procedures. The coordination site construction and spatial confinement strategies are adopted to prepare SACs with high metal loading. Advanced characterization techniques with atomic resolution are indispensable for identification of the exact structure of SACs. This is true, especially for the applications and challenges in developing in situ/operando characterization techniques at the atomic level, which are discussed in this Review. Moreover, it is fundamentally necessary to investigate the active center structure, which facilitates any design of efficient SACs that can maximize single-atom catalytic activity. Furthermore, this Review highlights challenges and prospects for development of SACs.									14	2	0	0	1	0	14			1867-3880	1867-3899		WOS:000589576500001

An emerging family of two-dimensional transition-metal carbides, nitrides and carbonitrides, also known as MXenes, have attracted increasing attention and in depth investigation. Benefitting from their unique intrinsic properties, MXenes have attracted significant attention and they have been considered as promising candidate materials for the development of environmentally friendly energy resources. A large number of studies show that MXenes have great potential in energy conversion and storage fields. Despite of their exceptional properties, MXenes also have some inherent characteristics, such as low capacities and unstable retention performances, which severely hinder their prospect applications in energy conversion and storage fields. In this Minireview, the latest progress on MXenes and their hybrid composites with small molecules, polymers, carbon or metal ions, and their applications in energy conversion and storage fields is highlighted, including their use in different types of batteries, supercapacitors, hydrogen/oxygen evolution reactions, electromagnetic interference absorption/shielding and solar steam generation.

Anodic graphite oxidation is commonly used with dilute mineral acid or aqueous salt electrolytes. In this system, the electrolyte acid concentration appears to be a critical parameter. However, the effect of the acid concentration, particularly at low concentrations, is still not fully understood. To address this issue, we used a packed bed electrochemical reactor to synthesize seven different electrochemical graphite oxide (EGO) products in 2???16 M sulfuric acid. Detailed XRD, XPS, Raman, conductivity and optical microscopy analysis of the products was carried out. We found dilute acid (<10 M) graphite oxides were less crystalline and less oxidized than those produced in stronger acids. The oxygen evolution reaction at the graphite surface appears to affect the structural changes, oxidation mechanism, and electrochemical corrosion of the anode. EGO conductivity is also strongly affected by the electrolyte???s acidity. We show that well oxidized, yet reasonably conductive, single layer graphene oxide can be produced from 7.1 M acid. These results broaden our understanding of graphite electrochemistry and will serve to inform future electrochemical graphene synthesis efforts.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			2096-6482	2589-9651		WOS:000856028800001

Here we present the results of electron irradiation on a 2: 1 mixture of carbon dioxide (CO2) and ethylene (C2H4). Our studies suggest that suprathermal oxygen atoms can add to the carbon-carbon pi bond of an ethylene molecule to form initially an oxirene diradical (addition to one carbon atom) and the cyclic ethylene oxide molecule (addition to two carbon atoms) at 10 K. The oxirene diradical can undergo a [1, 2]-H shift to the acetaldehyde molecule. Both the ethylene oxide and the acetaldehyde isomers can be stabilized in the surrounding ice matrix. To a minor amount, suprathermal oxygen atoms can insert into a carbon-hydrogen bond of the ethylene molecule, forming vinyl alcohol. Once these isomers have been synthesized inside the ice layers of the coated grains in cold molecular clouds, the newly formed molecules can sublime as the cloud reaches the hot molecular core stage. These laboratory investigations help to explain astronomical observations by Nummelin et al. and Ikeda et al. toward massive star-forming regions and hot cores, where observed fractional abundances of these isomers are higher than can be accounted for by gas-phase reactions alone. Similar synthetic routes could help explain the formation of acetaldehyde and ethylene oxide in comet C/1995 O1 (Hale-Bopp) and also suggest a presence of both isomers in Titan's atmosphere.									68	0	0	0	1	0	68			0004-637X	1538-4357		WOS:000233347800060

The two-dimensional Euler equations were used as the governing equations in combination with a detailed hydrogen-oxygen reaction model. Three different groups of mixtures, which represent various degrees of chemical reactivity, were investigated. The results show that, when the mixtures generally have a high degree of chemical reactivity, detonation initiation can eventually be realized successfully byMachreflection as well as the deflagration-to-detonation transition mechanism, independent of the spatial distribution of the mixtures in the channel. A recurring four-stage sequence of detonation initiation, detonation attenuation, initiation failure, and detonation reinitiation can be identified. When the mixtures generally have an intermediate degree of chemical reactivity, detonation combustion can be fully realized in the channel, where different overdrive degrees are found in the upper and lower halves. After the shutdown of the hot jet, the overdriven detonation attenuates gradually, and eventually a slightly overdriven detonation and a slightly underdriven detonation are generated, which can be regarded as a new stable state of propagation. However, whether a detonation can be initiated successfully is determined by the spatial mixture distribution. In mixtures with low degree of chemical reactivity, detonation initiation can generally not be realized. In this case, successful detonation initiation should be realizable by using of a stronger hot jet.									13	0	0	0	0	0	13			0001-1452	1533-385X		WOS:000381293200020

They are prepared by either one-pot syntheses, wherein different metals are mixed with suitable ligands and linkers, or by adopting post-synthetic modifications by soaking a monometallic MOF in a concentrated solution of a different (but compatible) metal ion. These bimetallic MOFs exhibit synergistic effects and enhanced properties compared to their monometallic counterparts, such as improved adsorption selectivity, selective catalysis and structural stability. Certainly, there are still many open challenges, given that bimetallic MOFs suffer from the typical drawbacks of MOFs, including high moisture sensitivity, easy oxidation due to their varying oxidation states, and possible metal leaching in liquids. In the present perspective, progress in the research on the synthesis and properties of bimetallic MOFs has been reviewed systematically, describing the synthetic strategies adopted to prepare targeted bimetallic MOFs and their applications in gas adsorption, catalysis, energy storage and conversion, and luminescence sensing. Additionally, the challenges facing the synthesis of stable and robust bimetallic MOFs have been discussed with a final outlook on their further development prospects.									6	0	0	0	1	0	6			1144-0546	1369-9261		WOS:000823799200001

We fabricated a NiMoN nanosheet hybrid catalyst through a reduction reaction of NiMoO4 nanosphere and urea under high-temperature annealing. The effects of annealing temperature on the surface chemical compositions of the catalyst were investigated, and it was found that the relative contents of various N-type species, Ni and Mo changed with the temperature. The relative contents of metal-N, metallic Ni, Mo3+ and Mo(4+)cations were increasing with the temperature increment, and significantly improved the activity of electrocatalytic water splitting. To drive a current density of 10 mA cm(-2), the bimetallic NiMoN requires an overpotential of 202 mV and 191 mV for the OER and HER, respectively. The two-electrode system using the NiMoN needs a very low cell potential of 1.58 V to reach a current density of 10 mA cm(-2). The catalyst also shows high durability in the case of 40 hours, while the overpotential is only slightly attenuated.

Thermal Stability and Spectroscopic Assessment of Bronsted Sites in Solid Acid-Layered Niobates								JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY C				123	40			24426	24435		10.1021/acs.jpcc.9b07087				OCT 10 2019	2019	Solid acid-based photocatalysts have been widely pursued to apply in different chemical conversions, as in Fischer-Tropsch synthesis and in the oxidation of alcohols and hydrocarbons. In the present work, layered niobates of composition HxM4-xNb6O17 (M = K, Rb, Cs) and HNb3O8 were synthesized by the sol gel method followed by proton exchange reaction. Local structure modifications due to proton incorporation were evaluated by X-ray powder diffraction and Raman spectroscopy. The Raman spectra point to a decrease in the symmetry of NbO6 groups with vibrational frequencies assigned to variations of Nb-O bond order. Thermally stable acid sites may reach an optimum temperature of 250 degrees C as dehydroxilation begins until total deprotonation at 570 degrees C. Impedance spectroscopy was performed to study the chemical properties of NbO-H bonds by evaluating the proton mobility under dry air and water vapor-saturated atmospheres. The impedance data show that hydrated protons are primarily bonded to the terminal oxygen of NbO6 octahedra as the electrons of hydronium H3O+ ions remain localized. The results suggest that layered HxK4-xNb6O17 hexaniobate merits further investigation as inexpensive and strong solid acid host for the photochemical conversion of gaseous reactants into renewable products at intermediate temperatures.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			1932-7447	1932-7455		WOS:000490353900010

We found that the potential shock process is inapplicable in a high-conductivity aqueous electrolyte, e.g. a MnO2 precursor solution (herein, 0.006 M KMnO4: 852-933 mu S/m). To avoid exceeding the output compliance of the current source, the potential shock voltage was optimized in ethylene glycol for the application of water oxidation. We found an optimal potential shock voltage of 140 V, which led to the doping of 0.7 at. % MnO2 into the high-aspect-ratio nanotubular TiO2 within 10 s. The TiO2 nanotubes doped with MnO2 were successfully employed as electrodes for the non-noble catalysis of water oxidation. Although the doping concentration of Mn was found to be linearly proportional to the applied potential shock voltages, potential shocks greater than 140 V significantly increased the thickness of the barrier oxide layer, which increased the overpotential in the water oxidation process.

Iron(III) oxide (alpha-Fe2O3) is a widely studied catalyst commonly used for solar water splitting. Recently, the water splitting efficiency with alpha-Fe2O3 was enhanced by deposition of an alpha-Al2O3 overlayer. In order to understand the origin of this improvement, we perform first-principles calculations with density functional theory + U on the alpha-Fe2O3(0001) surface with an alpha-Al2O3 surface overlayer. We find catalysis is unfavorable directly over alpha-Al2O3 and rather takes place over a-Fe203 exposed areas. In agreement with experiment, we find that alpha-Al2O3 coverage decreases the overpotential required for water oxidation on alpha-Fe2O3. We explain this improvement through the decrease in the work function of alpha-Fe2O3 upon aAl(2)O(3) coverage that aids in extracting electrons during the water oxidation reaction. We suggest that selecting an overlayer with a smaller work function than that of the catalyst as a strategy for future development of better catalysts.									44	1	0	0	0	0	45			2155-5435			WOS:000366153300023

Moreover, doping with different heteroatoms has increased the ability of the polymer-derived ceramics to produce tunable nanostructures with a controlled pore size and distributions. A preceramic precursor containing P has been prepared from a commercial polysiloxane polymer and a phosphate alkoxide. It has been subjected to thermal treatments in N-2, NH3, and Cl-2 atmospheres in different order sequences to create differentiated microstructures either in the ceramic matrix and the carbon phase. The structural, textural, and spectroscopic characterization revealed that the P atoms play a key role in the evolution of the microstructure during the thermal treatments. If the chlorination is carried out before the treatment in NH3, a silicophosphate matrix is formed and prevents from nitrogen incorporation into the free carbon phase. On contrary, if the NH3 treatment is carried out before the chlorination, the carbon phase is predominantly modified by the incorporation of P atoms within the free carbon network.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1546-542X	1744-7402		WOS:000860305900001

Potentiodynamic polarization measurements showed an active-to-passive transition followed by transpassivity. Unlike aqueous alkaline solutions, surface films created in active, far passive, and transpassive regions are few microns thick. Grazingincidence x-ray diffraction (GI-XRD), Raman, and x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements revealed that a thick and defective layer of NiO forms during polarization in the active region. Polarization into the passive regime reduces the thickness and number of defects of NiO and promotes passivity. With the formation of +3 valent nickel at far passive region, a thick, flaky adlayer of potassium-intercalated gamma-NiOOH is produced. At high transpassive potentials, the flake-like morphology deteriorated with the high rate of oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The micrometer thick electroactive anodic surface films formed during active, far passive, and transpassive region became a few micrometers thick because of the high dissolution rate of Ni and the high viscosity of the sub-molten KOH.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2468-0230			WOS:000807755400005

However, its excessively releasing into water and soil could bring about a serious threat to the environment and ecology due to the potential eutrophication. Considering the potential hydrogen content in urea, urea-rich wastewater is also regarded as a strategic energy storage resource. Among all technologies, the electrochemical treatment of urea wastewater behaves superior advantages both on environment protection and energy recovery, causing tremendous attention in recent years. Herein, this review summarized electrochemical methods for urea conversions for pollutant control and energy harvesting. As the kernel role in the electrochemical systems, the latest development of advanced electrodes is presented with the basic design principles described. The relationships between the electrocatalysts and their urea oxidation performance have been discussed thoroughly. Additionally, recent advances about novel applications for energy production and resource recovery are also displayed. Finally, the prospects and challenges are still to be addressed, orienting a clear direction for the electrochemical hydrogen harvesting from urea-containing wastewater in the future.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			1022-5528	1572-9028		WOS:000654123700001

However, the chemical and structural state of Cu catalyst surfaces during the CO2RR remains a matter of debate. Here, we show the structural evolution of the near-surface region of polycrystalline Cu electrodes under in situ conditions through a combination of grazing incidence X-ray absorption spectroscopy (GIXAS) and X-ray diffraction (GIXRD). The in situ GIXAS reveals that the surface oxide layer is fully reduced to metallic Cu before the onset potential for CO2RR, and the catalyst maintains the metallic state across the potentials relevant to the CO2RR. We also find a preferential surface reconstruction of the polycrystalline Cu surface toward (100) facets in the presence of CO2. Quantitative analysis of the reconstruction profiles reveals that the degree of reconstruction increases with increasingly negative applied potentials, and it persists when the applied potential returns to more positive values. These findings show that the surface of Cu electrocatalysts is dynamic during the CO2RR, and emphasize the importance of in situ characterization to understand the surface structure and its role in electrocatalysis.									68	1	0	0	2	0	68			0002-7863	1520-5126		WOS:000612557200005	33382947

Refractory inclusions were likely transported by turbulent diffusion and possible early disk expansion, and required low turbulence for their subsequent preservation in the disk, possibly in a dead zone. Chondrules were produced locally but did not necessarily accrete shortly after formation. Water may have been enhanced in the inner disk because of inward drift of solids from further out, but likely not by more than a factor of a few. Incomplete condensation in chondrites may be due to slow reaction kinetics during temperature decrease. While carbonaceous chondrite compositions might be reproduced in a "two-component" picture (Anders, 1964), such components would not correspond to simple petrographic constituents, although part of the refractory element fractionations in chondrites may be due to the inward drift of refractory inclusions. Overall, considerations of chondrite component transport alone favor an earlier formation for carbonaceous chondrites relative to their non-carbonaceous counterparts, but independent objections have yet to be resolved.

Using non-noble metals in the catalyst layer will reduce the capital costs associated with water electrolysis systems. The objectives of this study were to develop an effective membrane electrode assembly (MEA) for AEM electrolysis and to determine the effects of various operating parameters on AEM electrolysis. Here, the MEA consisted of the commercially available A-201 AEM and non-noble transition metal oxides as catalysts. The best electrolysis performance recorded was 500 mA cm-2 for 1.95 Vat 60 degrees C with 1% K2CO3 electrolyte. For the purpose of comparison, we also considered commercially available AEMs for AEM electrolysis: Fumapem FAA-3 and Fumapem FAA-3-PP-75. The performances achieved with these AEMs were comparable with the performance recorded for the conventional AEM A-201. Overall, our results indicated that AEM electrolysis clearly manifests the feasibility of commercial viability. (C) 2017 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Here, FeOOH QDs and CQDs was interspersed on g-C3N4 ultrathin nanosheet to promote H2O2 generation and in-situ decomposition. FeOOH QDs/CQDs/g-C3N4 composite (FCCN) exhibited excellent photoactivity for degrading oxytetracycline (OTC) under visible light illumination. The accelerated photoactivity is ascribed to the following merits: 1) the exciton dissociation interface and carrier transfer channel are fabricated to facilitate photoexcited electron transfer; 2) the photoexcited electron can be rapidly utilized by molecular oxygen to generate H2O2, resulting in facilitated molecular oxygen activation; 3) Fe3+ in FeOOH QDs is reduced to Fe2+ by photoexcited electron, and then reacts with generated H2O2 to produce center dot OH, thereby promoting photodegradation efficiency. The H2O2 generation yield of FCCN-2 composite was 224.24 mu mol h(-1) g(-1), which was higher than that of pure g-C3N4. 3,3',5,5'-tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) oxidation and center dot O-2(-) quantitative determination displayed outstanding molecular oxygen activation capacity of hybrid composite. Moreover, 0D/2D heterojunction photocatalyst displayed weakened charge carrier recombination efficiency (0.0015 s-1) and expedited surface carrier transfer efficiency (41.01%) compared to gC(3)N(4) and CQDs/g-C3N4 photocatalyst. Finally, the photodegradation mechanism were rationally evaluated based on the experiment results.									84	2	0	0	30	0	83			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000551969200136

Environmental research								114673	114673		10.1016/j.envres.2022.114673				2022-Nov-01	2022	The purpose of this research is to study the pulse electrochemical oxidation of paracetamol (PCT) using a novel PbO2 anode based on pulse electrodeposition strategy (PbO2-PE). The pulse electrodeposition strategy used to prepare a PbO2 anode resulted in rougher surface, higher directional specificity of beta(101) and more redox couples of Pb4+/Pb2+. Additionally, the oxygen evolution potential (OEP) and charge transfer resistance were also improved. When compared to direct current electrochemical oxidation process, pulse electrolysis in had a slightly higher PCT removal efficiency and active species (·OH and active chlorine) production, while 72.04% of energy consumption was saved. The effects of operating parameters on PCT degradation efficiency and specific energy consumption were studied. The findings suggested that the pulse electrochemical oxidation of PCT followed a pseudo-first-order kinetic model, with PCT removal reaching 98.63% after 60 min of electrolysis under optimal conditions. Possible mechanisms describing reaction pathways for PCT were also proposed. Finally, combinating with the economic feasibility and safety evaluation, we could conclude that pulse electrolysis with a PbO2-PE electrode was a promising option for improving the practicability of electrochemical treatment for refractory organic wastewater.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0				1096-0953		MEDLINE:36332673	36332673

Herein, we report a highly efficient electrocatalyst of P-Ni0.75Fe0.25Se2 prepared on nickel foam for overall water splitting. The optimal P-Ni0.75Fe0.25Se2 electrode exhibits an extremely low overpotential of 156 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) and 226 mV at 300 mA cm(-2) for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and the highly efficient activity remains stable for up to 1000 h at 300 mA cm(-2). More importantly, the water-alkali electrolyzer of P-Ni0.75Fe0.25Se2 parallel to MoNi4/MoO2 requires only 1.45 V and 1.82 V to reach current densities of 10 and 300 mA cm(-2), respectively, outperforming that of RuO2 parallel to MoNi4/MoO2. Systematically theoretical and experimental results reveal that P doping can independently modulate the electronic structure of Fe without affecting Ni, optimize the adsorption strength of OER intermediates at active sites and consequently facilitate the OER kinetics.									23	0	0	0	2	0	23			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000703581800001

Within this material family, perovskite oxynitrides incorporate earth-abundant nitrogen with differing size, electro-negativity, and charge into oxide, enabling a unique approach to tuning metal -anion covalency and energy of metal cation electronic states, thereby achieving functionality that may be inaccessible from their perovskite oxide counterparts, which have been widely studied as electrocatalysts. However, it is very challenging to directly obtain such materials due to the poor thermal stability of late transition metals coordinated with N and/or at high valence states. Herein, we introduce an effective strategy to prepare a perovskite oxynitride with a small fraction of sites substituted with Ir and adopt it as the first electrocatalyst in this material family, thereby enabling high activity and efficient utilization of precious metal content. From a series of characterization techniques, including X-ray absorption spectroscopy, atomic resolution electron microscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and X-ray diffraction, we prove the successful incorporation of Ir into a strontium tungsten oxynitride perovskite structure and discover the formation of a unique Ir-N/O coordination structure. Benefitting from this, the material exhibits a high activity toward the hydrogen evolution reaction, which exhibits an ultralow overpotential of only 8 mV to reach 10 mA/cm2geo in 0.5 M H2SO4 and 4.5-fold enhanced mass activity compared to commercial Pt/C. This work opens a new avenue for oxynitride material synthesis as well as pursuit of a new class of high-performance electrocatalysts.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0002-7863	1520-5126		WOS:000834099400001	35878066

The topology of this oxocentered Bi-O structural unit is two-dimensional and obviously related to the [O2Bi2](2+) layer typical for the Aurivillius type compounds. The formula of the oxocentered block is ([O8B8][O2Bi])(7+) with the first part in square brackets designating the moiety formed by the OBi4 tetrahedra, whereas the second part shows 3-coordinated 0 atoms and the Bi atoms not participating in the OBi4 tetrahedra. The interlayer in between the oxocentered 2D blocks is occupied by the phosphate groups and halogen atoms which are organized in alternating stripes. In the case of studied bismuth oxyphosphate halides as well as in other previously reported compounds, 'additional' oxygen atoms can be considered as segregation centers for Bi3+ cations. This viewpoint may appear to be useful for design of new schemes and synthetic routes to the bismuth oxysalt compounds with different structural architectures and possible useful applications. The comparison with the similar stairs-like layers in bismuth oxysalt structures is also given. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

Due to its low cost and abundant resources, non-precious metal catalysts have achieved rapid development and are widely used in the electrolysis of water. Among these catalysts, WS2 is known as a potential candidate for water decomposition catalysts because of its unique physical and chemical properties and crystal structure. Therefore, we summarize the application of WS2 in the field of electrolysis water splitting. First, the crystal structure, the principle of HER/OER, and the performance evaluation parameters are introduced. Then it focuses on the preparation and structure control of WS2, the method, and the mechanism of performance optimization. Finally, the research on theoretical calculations of WS2 and a discussion about the opportunities and challenges of WS2 as electrocatalyst in the future are summarized. To improve the readability of this review, a concise overview at the end of each section gives some of the characteristics and trends of the studies in the corresponding part.									23	1	0	0	1	0	23			1867-3880	1867-3899		WOS:000533435500001

In particular, exploration of nanoarchitectonics in two-dimensions (2D) has made great progress these days. Basically, 2D nanomaterials are a center of interest owing to the large surface areas suitable for a variety of surface active applications. The increasing demands for alternative energy generation have significantly promoted the rational design and fabrication of a variety of 2D nanomaterials since the discovery of graphene. In 2D nanomaterials, the charge carriers are confined along the thickness while being allowed to move along the plane. Owing to the large planar area, 2D nanomaterials are highly sensitive to external stimuli, a characteristic suitable for a variety of surface active applications including electrochemistry. Because of the unique structures and multifunctionalities, 2D nanomaterials have stimulated great interest in the field of energy conversion and storage. This review highlights recent progress in the synthesis of a variety of 2D nanomaterials and their applications in energy conversion and storage. Finally, opportunities and some critical challenges in these fields are addressed.									331	5	0	0	17	1	332			0009-2673	1348-0634		WOS:000399842800001

Here, we report observations on samples from the organic-rich Mississippian Barnett shale gas system (Fort Worth Basin, Texas, USA) at varying stages of thermal maturation. A multiscale characterization was achieved using a combination of compositional organic geochemistry and spectromicroscopy techniques, including synchrotron-based scanning transmission X-ray microscopy (STXM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). We document the chemical evolution of the macromolecular structure of Barnett Shale kerogen with increasing maturity, from an immature kerogen containing a significant aliphatic component and an important concentration of oxygen and sulfur-containing functional groups to an overmature kerogen dominated by poorly condensed aromatic structures. In addition to the presence of bitumen in samples of oil window maturity, very likely genetically derived from thermally degraded kerogen, the formation of nanoporous pyrobitumen has been inferred for samples of gas window maturity, likely resulting from the formation of gaseous hydrocarbons by secondary cracking of bitumen compounds.

The catalytic activity of NC-SACs originates from the coordinating structure between single metal site (M) and the doped nitrogen (N) in carbon matrix by forming M-N-x-C structure (1 <= x <= 4). The M-N-4-C structure is widely considered to be the most stable and effective catalytic site. However, there is no in-depth research for the "x" modulation in Pt-N-x-C structure and the corresponding catalytic properties. Herein, atomically dispersed Pt on N-doped carbon (Pt-NC) with Pt-N-x-C structure (1 <= x <= 4), as a research model, is fabricated by a ZIF-8 template and applied to catalytic oxygen reduction. Different carbonization temperatures are used to control N loss, and then modulate the N coordination of Pt-N-x-C structure. The Pt-NC has the predictable low half-wave potential (E-1/2) of 0.72 V vs RHE compared to the Pt/C 20% of 0.81V due to low Pt content. Remarkably, the Pt-NC shows a high onset potential (1.10 V vs RHE, determined for j = -0.1 mA cm(2)) and a high current density of 5.2 mA cm(-2), more positive and higher than that of Pt/C 20% (0.96 V) and 4.9 mA cm(-2) , respectively. As the structural characterization and DFT simulation confirmed, the reducing Pt-N coordination number induces low valence of Pt atoms and low free energy of oxygen reduction, which is responsible for the improved catalytic activity. Furthermore, the Pt-NC shows high mass activity (172 times higher than that of Pt/C 20%), better stability and methanol crossover resistance.

However, the activity of catalysts is restricted by scaling relation that low activation energy of N-2 is in conjunction with the over-strong affinity of intermediates, which blocks adsorption sites of catalyst and hinders NH3 production. Single atom alloy (SAA) is an efficient approach to circumvent this relation. In the present work, we offer a feasible strategy of preparing M1Ru (M = Fe, Co, Ni) SAA. Our studies show that Co1Ru SAA has the highest NH3 synthesis rate and the largest TOFRu value among M1Ru SAA. Compared with CoRu nanoparticle alloy (NPA), Co1Ru SAA has stronger electronic interaction between Co and Ru, which induces lower work function and up-shift d band center toward Fermi level for Co1Ru SAA, thus promoting N-2 activation. Meanwhile, the unique SAA structure could effectively tune N-2 activation pathway. Those findings make a contribution to the development of advanced catalysts for efficient NH3 synthesis at mild conditions. (C) 2021 Elsevier Inc.

Special focus has been placed on the spatial development of the flame and the temporal evolution of representative ignition spots that characterize the range of ignition behaviors observed in the case. Results show that the ignition process of the flame consists of four consecutive phases. Ignition occurs initially with relatively lean mixtures, and compared to the corresponding homogeneous stagnant adiabatic combustion, the loss of radical species associated with flow transportation causes a delay in ignition. The initial ignition spots formed during the autoignition phase provide sufficient conditions for the stabilization of the flame, including the provision of a variety of key radicals. Results also show that the flow convection accompanying the hot coflow dominated the slow flame propagation, and the turbulent mixing is of great importance for rapid flame propagation. These findings will broaden our knowledge of MILD combustion and provide useful insights into advanced ignition control.									3	1	0	0	0	0	4			0567-7718	1614-3116		WOS:000684481700001

While this complex decomposes rapidly to a less-active species under electrocatalytic conditions, detailed electro-chemical studies support the agency of an initial molecular catalyst. Cyclic voltammetry measurements confirm that the imidazolyl donors result in a more electron-rich Co center when compared with previous pyridine-based systems. The primary changes in electrocatalytic behavior of the present case are enhanced activity at lower pH and a marked dependence of catalytic activity on pH.									19	1	0	0	1	0	19			0020-1669	1520-510X		WOS:000456633400048	30589548

HARRIS, PT B		Advances in Quantum Chemistry		72				177	199		10.1016/bs.aiq.2015.05.005				2016	2016	State-of-the-art density functional theory calculations have been performed for ConPdn (n=1-10) clusters using the linear combination of Gaussian-type orbitals density functional theory (LCGTO-DFT) approach. Structures and energetic properties were calculated for these clusters. For each cluster size, several hundred isomers were studied to determine the lowest energy structures. Initial structures for the geometry optimization were taken along Born-Oppenheimer molecular dynamics (BOMD) trajectories recorded at different temperatures and considering several spin multiplicities. All structures were fully optimized without any symmetry restriction. The optimized structures were characterized by vibrational analysis. This represents the first systematic study on these bimetallic clusters based on non-symmetry adapted first-principle calculations. Ground state structures, relative stability energy, harmonic frequencies, binding energies, ionization potentials, electron affinities and spin density plots are reported. The analysis of the ground state structure evolution with increasing the cluster size indicates that peculiar structure motives characterize these systems at specific sizes. This work shows that the spin multiplicity of the ground state structure increases with cluster size and that the Pd atoms concentrate on the surface of the core formed by the cobalt atoms.

The evolution of surface and cross-sectional microstructure has been examined through back-scattered electron detector (BSE). Energy-dispersive x-ray spectroscopy (EDX) and x-ray diffractometer analysis (XRD) were also carried out to check the overall composition of the different samples. An oxidation model for Sn-9Zn-3Bi-xCr solders was proposed. The poor oxidation resistance of the solders is attributed to the oxidation of Zn-rich phase and other Zn atoms which diffused to the beta-Sn matrix grain boundaries, forming ZnO. Two kinds of Sn-Zn-Cr phases, along the grain boundaries of beta-Sn matrix and across the Zn-rich phase, were detected in Cr-bearing solder alloys, which kept the oxygen from diffusing into the bulk of the solder. Adding a small amount of Cr can improve the oxidation resistance of the solders, and the Sn-9Zn-3Bi-0.3Cr alloy had the best oxidation resistance. After 25h of aging under 250 degrees C, the both the two kinds of Sn-Zn-Cr phases re-crystallize.					12th International Conference on Electronic Packaging Technology and High Density Packaging (ICEPT-HDP)12th International Conference on Electronic Packaging Technology and High Density Packaging (ICEPT-HDP)	AUG 08-11, 2011AUG 08-11, 2011	IEEE; Chinese Inst Elect; IEEE Component Packaging & Mfg Technol Soc (IEEE-CPMT); Chinese Inst Elect, Elect Mfg & Packaging Technol Soc (EMPT); Shanghai Univ; ASTRI; Tsinghua Univ; Fudan Univ; Huazhong Univ Sci & Technol; Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ; Xidian UnivIEEE; Chinese Inst Elect; IEEE Component Packaging & Mfg Technol Soc (IEEE-CPMT); Chinese Inst Elect, Elect Mfg & Packaging Technol Soc (EMPT); Shanghai Univ; ASTRI; Tsinghua Univ; Fudan Univ; Huazhong Univ Sci & Technol; Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ; Xidian Univ	Shanghai, PEOPLES R CHINAShanghai, PEOPLES R CHINA	0	0	0	0	0	0	0					978-1-4577-1768-0	WOS:000309781000185		
J	Du, Xiaoqiang; Su, Hui; Zhang, Xiaoshuang								Cr doped-Co9S8 nanoarrays as high-efficiency electrocatalysts for water splitting								JOURNAL OF ALLOYS AND COMPOUNDS				824						153965	10.1016/j.jallcom.2020.153965				MAY 25 2020	2020	Doping transition metal ions into Co9S8 has received extensive attention as an electrocatalyst for water splitting. In this paper, Density functional theory (DFT) calculation is supposed to assess the water adsorption energy of M (M = 1-Cr, 3-Cr and 6-Cr) doped Co(x)S(8 )to better predict the water oxidation activity of all the synthetic materials and synergistic reaction mechanism between the content of doped Cr ion and cobalt ion. A series of Cr-Co(x)S(8)materials are firstly prepared by simple hydrothermal and sulfuration process. It is worth noting that only 1.45 V cell voltage is required to generate 10 mA cm(-2) current density during the whole water splitting, which is one of the smallest cell voltages reported. The experimental results are highly consistent with theoretical predictions. The excellent electrochemical activity of Cr-3-Co6S8/NF is mainly ascribed to the following factors: firstly, the presence of Cr3+ enhances the chemisorption free energy of water and the metallic nature of the material. Secondly, the rough surface around the honeycomb nanoarrays further improves the reaction surface area and promotes mass transfer rate. The work offers a new insight for developing an environmentally friendly and robust electrocatalyst for large-scale water splitting applications. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

Herein, we consider the use of SECCM operated in a controlled-current (galvanostatic or chronopotentiometric) mode, to synchronously obtain spatially resolved electrode potential (i.e., electrochemical activity) and topographical "maps". This technique is first applied, as proof of concept, to study the electrochemically reversible [Ru-(NH3)(6)](3+/2+)electron transfer process at a glassy carbon electrode surface, where the experimental data are in good agreement with well-established chronopotentiometric theory under quasi-radial diffusion conditions. The [Ru(NH3)(6)](3+/2+) process has also been imaged at "aged" highly ordered pyrolytic graphite (HOPG), where apparently enhanced electrochemical activity is measured at the edge plane relative to the basal plane surface, consistent with potentiostatic measurements. Finally, chronopotentiometric SECCM has been employed to benchmark a promising electrocatalytic system, the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) at molybdenum disulfide (MoS2), where higher electrocatalytic activity (i.e., lower overpotential at a current density of 2 mA cm(-2)) is observed at the edge plane compared to the basal plane surface. These results are in excellent agreement with previous controlled-potential SECCM studies, confirming the viability of the technique and thereby opening up new possibilities for the use of chronopotentiometric methods for quantitative electroanalysis at the nanoscale, with promising applications in energy storage (battery) studies, electrocatalyst benchmarking, and corrosion research.									25	1	0	0	0	0	26			0003-2700	1520-6882		WOS:000476567700067	31251561

The optical properties of LPP due to water emission were also evaluated. The correlation between the optical properties of plasma and the formation of active species in water was investigated with the photocatalytic activity of hydrogen production. TiO2 was also doped with Ag to evaluate the effect of enhancing photocatalytic activity. The photocatalytic activity was evaluated by the rate of hydrogen production, and the effect of hydrogen formation was also investigated by injecting methanol as an additive. As a result of examining the luminescence properties of LPP, it showed high luminescence in the 309 nm UV region and the 656 nm visible region. The hydrogen doping rate was increased in the Ag-doped TiO2 photocatalyst. Ag-doped TiO2 has wider light absorption into the visible region and narrower band gap. Due to these properties, the rate of hydrogen generation is superior to TiO2 photocatalysts. The photochemical reaction with LPP and photocatalyst in aqueous solution with CH3OH showed a significant increase in hydrogen production rate. The increase in hydrogen production by injection of additives is because the optical properties of generating OH radicals are improved and CH3OH is decomposed to act as an electron donor to improve hydrogen production.									24	1	0	0	6	0	24			0013-9351	1096-0953		WOS:000564656800006	32521308

In this work, N-doped CoP2 is successfully synthesized for efficient HER in an alkaline electrolyte, which needs an overpotential of only 64 mV to drive a current density of 10 mA cm(-2), with a small Tafel slope of 47.4 mV dec(-1) and excellent stability for 15 h without any performance loss in 1 M KOH. This represents one of the best HER catalysts in the alkaline electrolyte so far. The successful doping of N into CoP2 is confirmed using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, X-ray absorption near-edge structure, and scanning transmission electron microscopy characterizations. It is revealed by first-principle calculations that the partial replacement of P with N not only facilitates electron transfer but also optimizes the Gibbs free energies of H*, H2O, and OH* adsorption on the P active sites, thus facilitating the HER process. This work highlights that anion modification of transition metal phosphides would be an effective and feasible method to enhance their HER activities and provide new insights for the design of novel HER electrocatalysts.									27	1	0	0	1	0	27			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000468364500025	31020826

Herein, magnetic metal-encapsulated carbon nanotubes (CNTs) grown on carbon fibers are fabricated via a modified chemical vapor deposition procedure, whose electrical conductivity and electromagnetic shielding abilities can be effectively regulated by control of the metal ion constituent. The magnetic metal-encapsulated CNT bunches are densely grown on the surface of carbon fibers. In comparison with pristine carbon fibers possessing reflection-dominant shielding mechanism, the decoration of magnetic metal-encapsulated CNTs can effectively regulate reflection/absorption mechanism and is beneficial for the improvement of absorption. Off-axis electron holograms were applied to investigate electromagnetic absorption mechanism consisting of magnetic resonance (magnetic coupling interaction) and conductive loss (charge density distribution). CNTs grown on carbon fibers exhibit enhanced electromagnetic interference (EMI) shielding abilities with total shielding effectiveness values of more than 40 dB (blocking 99.99% EM waves). Furthermore, it also shows boosted oxygen evolution reaction performance with an overpotential of 344 mV and desirable stability, which was attributed to the improved conductivity and effective composite structure design.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			2522-0128	2522-0136		WOS:000773806000001

The WO3-NaTaO3 heterojunction was constituted and could be regulated by the adjustment of the W:Ta ratio, as confirmed by multiple characterizations. Due to the favorable CO anti-poisoning characteristics ascribed to the sufficient surface -OHad provided by both WO3 and NaTaO3, excellent stability of the WO3-NaTaO3 composite in acidic and alkaline environments, and charge transfer from metal oxide to Pt, the as-obtained Pt/WO3-NaTaO3 composite catalyst could exhibit desirably high electrocatalytic performances. As a result, the as-prepared Pt/WO3-NaTaO3 (W:Ta = 3:1) and Pt/WO3-NaTaO3 (W:Ta = 0.2:1) products exhibited optimal performances in the methanol oxidation reaction (MOR) process in acids and alkalis, respectively, as compared to those of commercial Pt/C, Pt/NaTaO3, and Pt/WO3 catalysts. In particular, in acidic and alkaline environments, the highest electrocatalytic activity of Pt/WO3-NaTaO3 catalyst could reach three times that of commercial Pt/C and its stability could reach more than five times that of commercial Pt/C. Density functional theory calculations further proved the enhancement of WO3 with regard to methanol electrooxidation.									8	0	0	0	0	0	8			1477-9226	1477-9234		WOS:000460780300027	30758360

The degradation process of the reactants was studied to remove dimethyl phthalate by using Zn-NiO (x) catalysts to generate powerful radicals from peroxomonosulfate. The results showed that the best experimental conditions were that Zn-NiO (x) concentration, the ratio between peroxomonosulfate ion and dimethyl phthalate and initial pH was 100 mg/L, 30:1 and 4.4 +/- 0.1, with 79.16% dimethyl phthalate degraded. The X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern of the catalysts showed Ni2O3, NiO, ZnO and Zn phases. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) showed that relative ratio of Zn, Ni2+ and surface hydroxyl groups (-OH) decreased by 2.7, 9.0 and 10.4% after the reaction, indicating that the electron transfer between multivalence as well as the existence of -OH might enhance the degradation process during the advanced oxidation system. Besides, the average grain size was in the 25-45 nm range as determined by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), which was nearly the same as that calculated using the Scherrer formula through XRD.									5	0	0	0	2	0	5			1878-5190	1878-5204		WOS:000413845800034

The factors affecting the deposition process, such as the potentials applied to the ITO substrate and the concentration of the precursors and citrate, were systematically investigated. We found that the potentials applied both for nucleus generation and for nucleus growth play important roles in tuning the morphology of the Ag NPs. It was also found that the concentration ratio of capping agent to precursor (R) is a critical factor; only when R is relatively low (R < 1.0) could the well-aligned Ag NPs be formed. However, a high R value will lead to the isotropic growth of the Ag crystal. A concentration-gradient-induced growth mechanism of vertically aligned Ag NPs is proposed on the basis of experimental results obtained. A Ag NPs/Ag3PO4 composite electrode was fabricated by a electrodeposition method. The photoelectrochemical oxygen evolution reaction activity of the Ag NPs/Ag3PO4 electrode is about 15.6 times higher than that of a control electrode, which was fabricated on the basis of a Ag electrode whose morphology was irregular polyhedrons.									27	1	0	0	5	0	27			1932-7447			WOS:000360947800054

Ag atoms significantly segregate onto the surface and preferentially occupy the low-coordinated sites, which significantly reduces the surface and strain energies of the nanoalloys. The segregation isotherms reveal that surface Ag composition is enhanced with increasing particle size or Ag concentration to circumvent the finite matter effects. Chemical ordering favored by attractive heterobonds can coexist and compete with surface segregation. Accordingly, small and Pd-rich nanoalloys display a continuous transition from Pd-core/mixing-shell to mixing-core/Ag-shell, where an ordered core is absent as a result of surface segregation and limited Ag supply. By contrast, large nanoalloys with equimolar or Ag-rich concentration exhibit the strong core ordering characteristics of bulk alloys. Particularly, surface patterns with partially alloyed facets and Ag-blocked vertices and edges are formed. This study also discussed the effects of isolating and blocking surface Pd active sites by Ag on the hydrogen evolution reaction and selective hydrogenation of acetylene.									29	1	0	0	1	0	29			1932-7447			WOS:000345891900029

Doping of sulfur atoms to be substituted for lattice oxygen atoms of titanium dioxide was carried out to extend the light absorption by atmosphere-controlled pulsed laser deposition, which allows direct preparation of impurity-included thin film such as sulfur-doped titanium dioxide. On the other hand, to enhance the surface catalytic reaction, nickel nanoparticles were deposited at the thin film substrate by chemical vapor reductive deposition method, which is a novel preparation technique of metallic nanoparticles on the substrate surface. Obtained sulfur-doped titanium dioxide was found to possess sensitivity to visible light with the wavelength up to 550 nm, indicating the photocatalytic activity in visible region. Sulfur doping induced the dye degradation activity under visible light irradiation. When nickel nanoparticles were deposited, a remarkable enhancement of the hydrogen evolution activity through ethanol decomposition of more than 20 times as much as unmodified titanium dioxide thin film was accomplished. In addition, the stability of sulfur atom doped into titanium dioxide structure was investigated. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Freshly prepared RuO2-Ta2O5 thin films containing between 30 and 80 at.% Ru were prepared by two different methods: the modified Pechini-Adams method (DPP) and standard thermal decomposition (STD). Electrochemical investigation of the electrode containing RuO2-Ta2O5 thin films was conducted as a function of electrode composition in a 0.5-mol dm(-3) H2SO4 solution, in the presence and absence of ethanol and its derivants (acetaldehyde and acetic acid). At a low ethanol concentration (5 mmol dm(-3)), ethanol oxidation leads to high yields of acetic acid and CO2. On the other hand, an increase in ethanol concentration (15-1000 mmol dm(-3)) favors acetaldehyde formation, so acetic acid and CO2 production is hindered, in this case. Electrodes prepared by DPP provide higher current efficiency than STD electrodes for all the investigated ethanol concentrations. This may be explained by the increase in electrode area obtained with the DPP preparation method compared with STD. (c) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

In this context, a remaining challenge in the systematical syntheses of hierarchically porous MOFs composites is existing to alter supermolecular structure, chemical composition, and versatile functionality. It is generally accepted that the regulation of MOF preparation is of great significance, which is related to the solubility of those starting inorganic components. We learn that there are several possible drawbacks induced by conventional soluble metal precursors in homogeneous reaction conditions, so the increasing research interest in the facile synthesis of MOFs and their derivatives from insoluble metal templates and/or precursors has been ignited in the past decade. In this review, we aim to provide an overview of the facile preparation and usage of MOF materials by using the unconventional inorganic precursors in heterogeneous synthetic conditions, including template types, preparation methods, extension strategies, advantages, limitations and related applications.

Using a bipolar membrane, comprised of both a cation and anion exchange membrane, operation across a pH gradient may be achieved, with the hydrogen and oxygen evolution reactions occurring in acidic and basic media, respectively. In this work, we focus on the characterization of hydrocarbon bipolar membranes for electrolytic water splitting based on two emerging classes of hydrocarbon ion-conducting polymers. The influence of the cation and anion exchange membrane interface on the efficiency of water dissociation is explored using two types of 3D, dual-fiber electrospun junctions. The results support the view that both high interfacial surface area and inclusion of Al(OH)(3) enhance water dissociation under high current densities and affect the rate of ion leakage under open circuit potential. While dual-fiber electrospun interfacial layers were found to provide high junction surface areas, poor adhesion of some hydrocarbon-based polymers is observed due to their relatively high glass transition temperature. This restricts the formation of a strong interfacial layer, as the different polymers are unable to properly entangle while in the glass phase.									13	0	0	0	0	0	13			2574-0962			WOS:000487770000078		
J	Lee, GR; Crayston, JA								Studies on the electrochemical deposition of niobium oxide								JOURNAL OF MATERIALS CHEMISTRY				6	2			187	192		10.1039/jm9960600187				FEB 1996	1996	Various strategies for the electrodeposition of niobium oxide from both non-aqueous and aqueous solution are explored. The methods used were based on the electrochemical manipulation of the pH which leads to hydrolysis of soluble, well defined niobium precursors, leading to oxide deposition at the electrode. The reactions which proceed are believed to be closely related to those involved in conventional sol-gel processing. In non-aqueous systems containing niobium alkoxides, hydroxide ions are generated by the two-electron reduction of tertiary alcohols (at < -2.5 V) and react with the niobium precursor to give a film of niobium oxide on the dropping mercury electrode. Hydroxide generation via the reduction of oxygen to superoxide in O-2-saturated, non-aqueous solvents containing NbOCl3 did not, however, lead to niobium oxide films. In acidic aqueous systems containing [NbOCl5](2-) species, raising the local pH around the electrode by hydrogen evolution does give rise to niobium oxide deposition, but not at the electrode; In aqueous alkaline solutions of the niobates K7H [Nb6O19] or (TMA)(6)[Nb10O28] (TMA = tetramethylammonium), protons generated by the electrochemical oxidation of water at > + 1.5 V cause the formation of mixed niobate and niobium oxide films on the electrode after > 30 min.									26	1	0	0	1	0	26			0959-9428			WOS:A1996UA49400011		
J	FALLA, NAR								LINOLEIC BASED COATINGS - A STUDY OF THE DRY FILM STRUCTURE								JOURNAL OF COATINGS TECHNOLOGY				64	815			55	60						DEC 1992	1992	Soya alkyds and other linoleic based coating resins are widely used by the U.K. paint industry in the manufacture of solventborne decorative coatings.It is well known that the autooxidation of drying oils like soya is accompanied by the uptake of significant quantities of oxygen and the evolution of similar amounts of volatile degradation products. However, rather less is known about the structure of the dry film that remains to form the protective coating.In this study, infrared spectroscopy, gel permeation chromatography, and liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry have been used to study the structure of dry films formed from both soya oil and methyl linoleate.The studies show the films to be polymers based on C10H18O3 repeat units with carboxylic acid, aldehyde, or hydroxyl end groups. These results indicate that the polymerization of a long oil alkyd coating is accompanied by scission of the fatty acid chains to leave C-9 residues attached to the polymer backbone in place of the C18 moieties. Such reactions can be expected to occur both during the initial drying and subsequent aging of the coating, and the loss of these C-9 plasticizing components must have a significant effect on the physical properties of the alkyd film.									31	0	0	0	1	0	32			0361-8773			WOS:A1992KC85900004

While humans have only a single functional aldehyde oxidase (AOX1) gene, rodents are endowed with four AOXs; AOX1 and three aldehyde oxidase homologs (AOH1, AOH2 and AOH3). In continuation of our previous study conducted to identify genes differentially expressed during myogenesis using a microarray approach, we investigated AOX1 with respect to its role in myogenesis to conceptualize how it is regulated in C2C12 cells. The results obtained were validated by silencing of the AOX1 gene. Analysis of their fusion index revealed that formation of myotubes showed a marked reduction of up to 40% in AOX1(kd) cells. Expression of myogenin (MYOG), one of the marker genes used to study myogenesis, was also found to be reduced in AOX1(kd) cells. AOX1 is an enzyme of pharmacological and toxicological importance that metabolizes numerous xenobiotics to their respective carboxylic acids. Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) produced as a by-product in this reaction is considered to be involved as a part of the signaling mechanism during differentiation. An observed reduction in the level of H2O2 among AOX1(kd) cells confirmed production of H2O2 in the reaction catalyzed by AOX1. Taken together, these findings suggest that AOX1 acts as a contributor to the process of myogenesis by influencing the level of H2O2. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

J	Bouchard, M; Jolicoeur, S								Chemical weathering studies in relation to geomorphological research in southeastern Canada								GEOMORPHOLOGY				32	3-4			213	238		10.1016/S0169-555X(99)00098-7				MAR 2000	2000	Although chemical weathering provides fundamental information relevant to geomorphology, the subject has been overlooked during the 20th century in Canada. This paper provides an overview of the current state of Canadian research on chemical weathering in southeastern Canada and takes into account three spatial and temporal contexts: (1) the formation of bedrock morphology by chemical weathering, (2) occurrences, characteristics and age of saprolites and (3) contemporary chemical denudation rates. Long-term geomorphological evolution of southeastern Canadian landscapes shows that chemical weathering has played an important role, An example is taken from the Laurentide region of the Canadian Shield north of Montreal (Quebec). The present topography resulted from the stripping of the former weathering mantle and from the probable subsequent modification of the weathering front, first by the action of hillslope processes and rivers and then by glaciers, before and during Plio-Pleistocene times. The present landscape reflects the timing of the formation of erosion surfaces, and of the stripping of the Paleozoic cover rocks and exposure of the Shield. Since the late seventies, several isolated occurrences of saprolite-soil profiles have been discovered in eastern Canada and prompted a renewal of the study of these materials about the Cenozoic evolution of these regions, One of the problems in this field of research is the dating of saprolites and their inclusion in a chronostratigraphic framework, along with the other Cenozoic surficial deposits and landforms, Because of the multiple factors involved in the development of secondary minerals in saprolites during the course of weathering, it is preferable to distinguish the dating of saprolites from the study of their mineralogical and geochemical evolution. Fortunately, several new techniques are becoming available for the absolute dating of surficial deposits and saprolites, including the use of cosmogenic radionuclides. Saprolites provide a strong potential field of research for our understanding of the geological evolution of eastern Canada during the Cenozoic. Contemporary weathering and erosion rates are fields of research that have gained increasing interest recently, since modeling landscape geochemical response can be applied to various environmental stress situations, such as acidification by rain and forest harvesting. Rock-type may be the main factor explaining the large differences between watersheds. In fact, variability of cation removal in the temperate zone is probably most closely related to flow-paths of water. Investigations, at different scales, from entire watersheds to slopes to individual pedons, highlight the problem. In the Catamaran Brook watershed (New Brunswick), water chemistry is explained by a mix of groundwater and soil solution from the horizons at the base of the floodplain soils. Geochemical mass-balances based on net outputs give little information on the weathering reactions of primary minerals, the weathering products or on the nature of the weathering processes that provide the dissolved load of streams. Mineralogic and petrographic analysis of selected soil pedons are necessary to determine weathering reactions and their role as sources or sinks for bases, silica. aluminum and iron in the various compartments through which water percolates before it reaches the stream.

Compared with pristine TiO2 nanorod arrays (0.55 mA/cm2 at 1.23 V vs. RHE), the TiO2/ Tan-Fe exhibits the enhanced photocurrent density (0.98 mA/cm2 at 1.23 V vs. RHE). The enhancement of photoelectrochemical (PEC) performance is mainly attributed to tannic acid-Fe as a light absorber with a wide absorbance region and increasing charge separation and transport in the composite photoanode, which is testified via ultraviolet-visible absorption, enhanced charge separation efficiency and Motty-Schottky curves, and so on. Importantly, the modification of tannic acid-Fe as a cocatalyst facilitates the water oxidation dynamic, which is confirmed by charge injection efficiency and oxygen evolution reaction (OER). These results indicate that the rationally designed and assembled photoanode has the potential to improve PEC performance and fabricate solar cell for efficient photoelectric conversion.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1293-2558	1873-3085		WOS:000869796900003

However, a high concentration of defects and an amorphous surface promote the recombination of photogenerated holes and electrons in this material, thus reducing its performance. In this work, annealing in an Ar flow is used to activate the BaTaO2N surface and thus improve its water oxidation activity. The results show that annealing at 1073 K both crystallizes the amorphous BaTaO2N surface and increases the bulk crystallinity. Following surface modification to enhance charge separation during the photoreaction, a photoanode made of the annealed BaTaO2N generates an unprecedented photocurrent of 6.5 mA cm(-2) at 1.23 V-RHE during sunlight-driven water oxidation and retains 79% of the initial photocurrent over 24 h. The half-cell solar-to-hydrogen energy conversion efficiency reaches 1.4% at 0.88 V-RHE, representing the highest value yet reported for any perovskite-type oxynitride with intense visible light absorption. This remarkable improvement demonstrates that a surface treatment based on annealing in Ar effectively enhances the photoreaction over oxynitrides that otherwise tend to have amorphous surfaces.									22	1	0	0	1	0	21			2574-0962			WOS:000483434700051

MXenes, a new intriguing family of 2D transition metal carbides, nitrides, and carbonitrides, have recently received considerable attention due to their unique combination of properties such as high electrical conductivity, hydrophilic nature, excellent thermal stability, large interlayer spacing, easily tunable structure, and high surface area. In this review, we discuss how 2D MXenes have emerged as efficient and economical nanomaterials for future energy applications. We highlight the promising potential of these materials in energy conversion and storage applications, such as water electrolyzers, lithium ion batteries, and supercapacitors. Finally, we present an outlook of the future development of MXenes for sustainable energy technologies.									300	21	0	0	17	0	304			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000417063200002		
J	Duan, Tigang; Chen, Ye; Wen, Qing; Duan, Ying								Different mechanisms and electrocatalytic activities of Ce ion or CeO2 modified Ti/Sb-SnO2 electrodes fabricated by one-step pulse electro-codeposition								RSC ADVANCES				5	25			19601	19612		10.1039/c5ra01876e				2015	2015	Sb-doped SnO2 electrode was fabricated by the one-step pulse electro-codeposition method, and was modified through either cerium dioxide nanoparticle (nano-CeO2) or cerium ion doping. The results showed that the effects of nano-CeO2 doping and cerium ion doping are quite different. Nano-CeO2 doping shrinks the unit cell volume, improves the degree of crystallinity and refines crystalline grains, while cerium ion doping expands the volume and deteriorates the crystallinity. Nano-CeO2 doping mitigates the surface antimony enrichment and promotes the complete oxidation of antimony so that the majority of antimony oxidation states exist as the Sb5+ state, but cerium ion doping aggravates the enrichment and increases the Sb3+ content. Electrochemical phenol degradation showed that the Ti/Sb-SnO2-CeO2 electrode has a higher degradation efficiency and its kinetic rate constant is 1.46 times as much as that of Ti/Ce-Sb-SnO2. Besides, due to the compact active layer of Ti/Sb-SnO2-CeO2 protecting the titanium substrate from passivation, the accelerated service lifetime of Ti/Sb-SnO2-CeO2 is prolonged, which is 1.28 times as long as that of Ti/Ce-Sb-SnO2.									49	2	0	0	7	0	51				2046-2069		WOS:000350043600080

Fabrication and characterisation of a mixed oxide-covered mesh electrode composed of NiCo2O4 and its capability of generating hydroxyl radicals during the oxygen evolution reaction in electrolyte-free water								JOURNAL OF SOLID STATE ELECTROCHEMISTRY				22	5	SI		1289	1302		10.1007/s10008-017-3815-9				MAY 2018	2018	A mixed oxide-covered mesh electrode composed of NiCo2O4 (MOME-NiCo2O4) was prepared on a stainless-steel substrate using thermal decomposition (slow-cooling rate method). Surface, bulk and electrochemical properties of MOME were studied using different techniques, namely scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), cyclic voltammetry (CV) with determination of the electrochemical porosity (phi) and morphology factor (phi) parameters, quasi-stationary polarisation curves (PC) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). SEM images revealed a good coverage of the metallic wires by a compact oxide layer (absence of cracks). XRD analysis confirmed the formation of the spinel NiCo2O4 with the presence of NiO. The 'in situ' surface parameters denoted as phi and phi exhibited values of 0.39 and 0.33, respectively, revealing that the electrochemically active surface area is mainly confined to the 'outer/external' surface regions of the oxide layer. The PC was characterised by two Tafel slopes distributed in the low (b(1) = 46 mV dec(-1)) and high (b(2) = 59 mV dec(-1)) overpotential domains. The corresponding apparent exchange current densities were j(0(1)) = (3.43 +/- 0.11) x 10(-6) A cm(-2) and j(0(2)) = (6.70 +/- 0.08) x 10(-6) A cm(-2), respectively. The EIS study accomplished in the low-overpotential domain revealed a Tafel slope (b(1)) of 51 mV dec(-1). According to the spin-trapping reaction using N,N-dimethyl-p-nitrosoaniline (RNO), the MOME-NiCo2O4 electrode exhibited good performance for the generation of weakly adsorbed hydroxyl radicals (HO center dot) during the OER in electrolyte-free water.					21st Brazilian Symposium of Electrochemistry and Electroanalysis (SIBEE)21st Brazilian Symposium of Electrochemistry and Electroanalysis (SIBEE)	APR, 2017APR, 2017	Int Soc Electrochemistry; Electrochem Soc; Metrohm Impalla; PWM BrasilInt Soc Electrochemistry; Electrochem Soc; Metrohm Impalla; PWM Brasil	Natal, BRAZILNatal, BRAZIL	4	1	0	0	0	0	5			1432-8488	1433-0768		WOS:000430301800003

The concurrence of acute coronary syndrome with hypersensitivity and anaphylactic or anaphylactoid reactions constitutes the Kounis syndrome. We report a case of a coronary stent thrombosis with a fatal outcome complicating an anaphylactic shock induced by amoxicillin-clavulanic acid association. A 58-year-old woman with a history of triple coronary stenting was treated by amoxicillin/clavulanic acid association for pharyngitis. One hour after the first drug intake, she developed an anaphylactic shock with acute constricting chest pain. She received intravenous hydrocortisone and was transferred to emergency department. The patient received epinephrine intravenously with fluid perfusion and oxygen. Electrocardiogram showed Pardee waves in the anterior precordial leads. Cardiac enzyme levels (troponin I) were disturbed. The patient was transferred to the coronary care unit with a diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction. The coronary angiography revealed anterior interventricular stent thrombosis. The patient experienced a cardiogenic shock with an important hemodynamic repercussion, and she died few hours later despite emergency care. The responsibility of amoxicillin clavulanic acid association was retained in the genesis of this anaphylactic shock in front of a suggestive delay, a compatible evolution and a high semiotic score. Amoxicillin/clavulanic acid use may cause Kounis syndrome. The use of epinephrine is a challenging decision. We suggest that Kounis syndrome should be considered in the differential diagnosis of acute coronary syndrome. (C) 2016 Societe francaise de pharmacologie et de therapeutique.

However, the sensing properties of layered cobaltites with metallic conductivity have not been investigated to date. In this work, we developed a convenient preparation method of NaxCoO2 nanoflakes via aqueous ultrasonic exfoliation of NaxCoO2 single crystals. The sensor based on NaxCoO2 nanoflakes was fabricated, whose resistance is obviously smaller than that of the typical metal oxide based sensors. It shows less response to n-hexane, toluene, xylene, ammonia, methanol, ethanol and acetone. However, it exhibits excellent sensing performance to n-butanol and good moisture-resistance, and the sensitivity to 50 ppm n-butanol is up to 4.48 with the response time of 95 s and the recovery time of 154 s at the optimum working temperature of 200 degrees C. Owning to the high electric conductivity of NaxCoO2 layers, the sensor presents a very low noise and a high signal-to-noise ratio value with the detection limit at ppb level. The layered cobaltites exhibit the rich phase diagram and the nanoflakes are versatile surface functionalization. This work provides insight for layered cobaltites to be employed as highly sensitive sensors.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000848138200001

Here, we synthesized a novel hydrophilic spherical 1T-MoS2 through hexadecyl trimethyl ammonium bromide (CTAB) template-assisted hydrothermal reaction as cathode materials for ARZIBs and systematically study its mechanism of electrochemical enhancement. The results suggest that stable spherical MoS2 was prepared by in-situ reduction of molybdate ion under the electrostatic absorption of CTAB template and O element introduced by ethylene glycol (oil-phase solvent) not only increases the hydrophilicity of the material and facilitates the intercalation of ammonium ions and water molecules, but also promotes the formation of the 1 T phase by changing the electronic structure. Consequently, this modified electrode exhibits a reversible capacity of 110 mAh g(-1) at the current density of 1.0 A g(-1), and the capacity retention rate is up to 90% after 500 cycles, showing excellent cycling stability and rate performance.

With the infiltration of alloys at 1750 degrees C into a composite preform containing carbon and carbide powders for 15 min, a high-entropy matrix was successfully formed in situ. Arc jet tests were conducted in the temperature range of 1800-1900 degrees C. Results showed the formation of an oxidized region composed of complex oxides, such as (Zr, Hf)O-2, (Nb, Ta)(2)(Zr, Hf)(6)O-17, (Zr, Hf) TiO4, and Ti(Nb, Ta)(2)O-7, with an average thickness of similar to 600 mu m, under which an unoxidized region remained. The porous oxidized region resulted from the evolution of CO(g) during oxidation, while a dense oxide region formed as the outermost region. This indicates that the dense oxide region acted as a barrier to oxygen diffusion for the unoxidized region during oxidation.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			0272-8842	1873-3956		WOS:000702782100004

Here, the focus is on NA materials for chemical catalysis (except photocatalysis or electrocatalysis). In terms of composition, NA systems are divided into three groups, noble metal, base metal, and noble/base metal mixed NAs. Their design and fabrication for the optimization of catalytic performance are systematically summarized. Additionally, the correlations between the composition/structure and catalytic properties are also mentioned.

In particular, cyanocobalamin (Vitamin B12) is the most effective for improving watersplitting activity, and the formation rate of H-2 and O-2 are achieved values of 1912 and 979 mu mol g(cat)(-1)h(-1), respectively, under the light irradiation from Xe lamp (300W). Mechanism of photocatalytic H2O splitting into H-2 and O-2 on PtOx/KTa(Zr)O-3 modified with various dyes were investigated. Photoluminescence (PL) spectra of KTaO 3catalysts suggested that the excitation energy transfers from KTaO 3 to Cr-Tetraphenylporphyrin (Cr-TPP) and PtOx co-catalyst. Transient response of photovoltaic potential revealed that the excitation state of KTaO 3 was enlarged over 500 mu s by dye-modification. Photo-excited electron in KTaO 3 transfers to dye, and a long charge separation state was achieved. Thus, it was suggested that the photocatalytic activity was much improved by increasing lifetime of photo-excited charges which can reach to the reaction site effectively.

Nevertheless, such a passivated state can be lost by the occurence of a corrosion process. In the potential region 0.9 to 1.3 V/SCE close to the thermodynamic potential for chloride oxidation, SnO2 spray-deposited thin film electrodes present a loss of mass, determined in situ by quartz crystal microbalance experiments. This phenomenon is characterized by a peak-shaped corrosion rate, the amplitude of which depends on the pH, the chloride concentration, the presence of metallic traces, the type of the dopant. From data obtained at pH 8, it is shown that the corrosion rate is (i) amplified by the presence of metallic traces, (ii) is strongly dependent on the Cl- content, becoming almost negligible for Cl- > 0.3M. These results are tentatively explained by considering the electrochemical production of OHO and Cl degrees radicals, able to break Sn-O surface bonds by electron capture (chemical steps), in competition with chlorine and oxygen evolution. The corrosion process is also responsible for a positive shift of band edges due to charged corrosion intermediates. This shift allows the SnO2 electrode to become active with respect to anodic charge transfer reactions.

The ligand used was 3,3'-17-crown-6-SAL-3-CH3-OPHEN (1). Dimer 3 reacted with KPF6 and Ba(SO3CF3)(2) in DMF forming 3 2KPF(6) and 3 2Ba(SO3CF3)(2) and these were isolated and characterized by spectroscopic and electrochemical means. All of the dimers participated in a reversible two-electron transfer process that produced the corresponding Mn-II,Mn-II (mu-oxo) dimer. Inclusion of cations into the crown ether portions of the dimer caused that formal reduction potential of 3 to shift to more positive values: E degrees (3) = - 120 mV, CH2Cl2; E degrees (3 2KPF(6)) = 0 mV, CH3CN; E degrees (3 2Ba(SO3CF3)(2)) = 180 mV, CH3CN all versus SSCE. Results of UV-Vis experiments suggested that the shift in formal reduction potential was caused primarily by an electrostatic effect and not a perturbation of the d orbitals on the Mn(III) centers.									27	0	0	0	4	0	27			0020-1693	1873-3255		WOS:A1994PN81200025

In this study, we use a combination of whole rock geochemistry, LA-ICPMS trace element analysis of sedimentary pyrite and pyrrhotite and SHRIMP-SI sulfur isotope analyses to elucidate the chemical changes in these sedimentary rocks. These proxies are used to examine chemical conditions of the ocean during the late Archean. Two to three periods of oxygen enrichment prior to the deposition of banded iron formations (BIF) can be identified. One minor stage of general increase in whole rock enrichment factors and trace element content of pyrite is observed up stratigraphy in the Jeerinah Formation, Fortescue Basin and a more substantial stage is present in the Paraburdoo and Bee Gorge Members of the Wittenoom Formation, Hamersley Basin. Some of the trace element enrichments indicate organic matter burial flux (Ni, Cr, Zn, Co and Cu) which suggests an increase in biological productivity. If the increased biological activity reflects an increase in cyanobacteria activity then an associated increase in oxygen is likely to have occurred during the deposition of the Bee Gorge Member. An increase in atmospheric oxygen would result in continental weathering of sulfide and other minerals, increasing the trace element content of the water column via erosion and avoiding excessive depletion of trace elements due to drawdown in seawater. Since some of these trace elements may also be limiting nutrients (such as Mo and Se) for the cyanobacteria, the degree of biological productivity may have further increased due to the increasing amount of trace elements introduced by oxygenation in a positive feedback loop. These periods of increased productivity and oxygen rise stopped prior to the onset of BIF deposition in the Hamersley Basin. This may be due to the ocean reaching an oxidation threshold, enabling the precipitation of hematite and magnetite BIF. The BIF deposition caused depletion of ocean nutrients such as phosphate, severely limiting the growth of cyanobacteria, and thus limiting further oxygen production. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

In the present study, we design a novel ORR electrocatalyst of iron-cobalt (FeCo) alloy nanoparticles embedded on N-doped porous carbon nanofibers (FeCo@PCNF-T) by electrospinning of [Polyacrylonitrile (PAN)/Prussian blue analogues/CaCO3] and post-calcination treatment. The obtained catalysts with bimetallic active sites show unique three-dimensional (3D) hierarchical meso/macropores structures. FeCo alloy nanoparticles are encapsulated into graphitic carbon that can increase stability and provide additional catalytic active sites. Under the optimized condition, FeCo@PCNF-800 displays excellent ORR electrocatalytic activity in alkaline solutions, with a more positive half-wave potential (E-1/2 of 0.854 V vs RHE) and larger limited-diffusion current density (j of 6.012 mA cm(-2)) than those of 20 wt% Pt/C (E-1/2 of 0.849 V and j of 5.710 mA cm(-2)). In addition, FeCo@PCNF-800 also exhibits comparable ORR electrocatalytic activity in acidic solutions to those of 20 wt% Pt/C with onset potential and half-wave potential as more positive as 0.843 V vs RHE and 0.739 V vs RHE, respectively. Moreover, FeCo@PCNF-800 exhibits excellent tolerance towards methanol, stability and a four-electron pathway in both basic and acidic solutions. The excellent ORR electrocatalytic activity performance of FeCo@PCNF-800 is attributed to the synergistic effect of the FeCo alloy nanoparticles and N-doped porous carbon nanofibers. The synergistic effect can improve the mass and charge transport capability and increase active sites of FeCo-N-C. Furthermore, this work offers a new insight for the reasonable design and development of efficient non-noble metal electrocatalysts for challenging electrochemical energy related technologies.

Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) were used to analyze the morphologies of preoxidized fibers. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and thermal gravimetry (TG) were used to characterize the chemical structure, crystal structure and thermal properties, respectively. The chemical structure and morphology of the same region of the fiber were obtained together by nano infrared spectroscopy atomic force microscope (NanoIR2-FS), which was convenient to study the relationship between them. The results showed that the difference of chemical structure between the skin and core region increased in the early stages of preoxidation and decreased in the late stages of preoxidation. The change of morphology was consistent with the chemical structure. Microfibrils along the fiber axis and lamella structures perpendicular to the fiber axis were observed, and the morphology became denser due to the transformation of chemical structure. In addition, the cross-sectional fracture morphologies of the preoxidized fibers changed and the crystallization degree of the preoxidized fibers decreased.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0014-3057	1873-1945		WOS:000713238600002

Altering the Electrocatalytic Activity of Plasmonic Cu/Cu2O Nanocomposites towards Water Splitting through Surface Functionalization with Various Amino Acids								CHEMISTRYSELECT				5	23			7049	7055		10.1002/slct.202001062				JUN 23 2020	2020	Present study explores stabilization of copper/cuprous oxide nanomaterials using amino acids as capping agents. The one-pot and time efficient synthesis method have been employed to synthesize amino acids functionalized copper nanomaterials. The nanomaterials are composed of both copper (0) and copper (I) species and are stable towards environmental oxidation under ambient conditions. Eight different amino acids were used for surface functionalization of the Cu/Cu2O nanocomposites where the type of amino acids are found to play an important role in manipulating the morphology, crystalline nature and the optical properties of the synthesized nanocomposites. Moreover, these materials are tested for electrochemical water splitting process and are found superior to traditional Cu-based electro-catalysts reported in literature. The capping with amino acids lead to modification in the electro-chemical parameters such as charge carrier density, flat band potential, electrochemical surface area, etc. activity dependent on amino acid used. Among these amino acids, Alanine capped nanocomposites gave highest current density of 125 +/- 5 mA cm(-2)at an over potential of -0.4 V vs. RHE.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			2365-6549			WOS:000542282800026

SEM and EDS reveal that the existence of the G/A composite prevents the electrode from pulverizing and oxidizing. The oxygen content in the surface of the electrode is reduced from 21.26% to 9.83% after 50 cycles for a Mg-Ni-La electrode with 0.2 mass fraction of G/A. HRTEM shows that the amorphous electrodes with no G/A coating are almost all crystallized, and that the stable Mg2NiH4, alpha-Mg, MgH2 and LaH2 phases are present with grain sizes as large as 100-120 nm after 50 cycles of charging/discharging. The G/A coating reduces the corrosion and oxidation of the electrode alloy and provides both a pathway for hydrogen diffusion and active sites for the redox reaction of hydrogen. All these factors generate a significant enhancement of the discharge capacity by about 250 mAhg(-1) in each cycle (after activation) for Mg-Ni-La electrodes with 0.2 G/A nanocomposites.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1452-3981			WOS:000391039000049

The results show that only CO2 or H2O chemisorption occurred in the non-isothermal experiments, not gasification; however, the intrinsic reaction rate (IRR) of coal char conversion at the same O-2 concentration still increases in an orderly manner under O-2/CO2, O-2/N-2 and O-2/H2O atmospheres. This result is due to the different chemisorption mechanisms of CO2 and H2O, namely, the production of C(CO), C(OH) and C(H) from CO2 and H2O chemisorption. At the same O-2 concentration, the trends and magnitudes of variable activation energies for coal char combustion under O-2/CO2 and O-2/N-2 atmospheres are similar, while they are very different from those under O-2/H2O conditions. Therefore, CO 2 has little influence on the reactivity, while H2O changes the reactivity. In addition, according to the developed reaction mechanism, it is concluded that the SVAE method contributes to the characteristic intrinsic reactivity of coal char conversion under different atmospheres.

J	Gao, Yanyan; Chen, Jie; Qian, Hui; Wang, Haike; Ren, Wenhao; Qu, Wengang								Hydrogeochemical characteristics and processes of groundwater in an over 2260 year irrigation district: A comparison between irrigated and nonirrigated areas								JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY				606						127437	10.1016/j.jhydrol.2022.127437				MAR 2022	2022	A comprehensive understanding of groundwater chemistry and its evolution in irrigation districts is essential for irrigation management. In this study, with emphasis on a comparison between irrigated and nonirrigated areas, the groundwater chemistry and hydrogeochemical processes of a typical irrigation district with an irrigation history of over 2260 years were studied to clarify the effects of long-term irrigation on groundwater quality. Based on 107 water samples collected from across the study area, a comprehensive analysis was conducted using multivariate statistics, stable isotope analysis, and hydrogeochemical modeling. The results showed that the variation range and average concentrations of almost all the ions in the irrigation district are much greater than those in the nonirrigated areas. The groundwater in the nonirrigated areas could be characterized by low TDS and HCO3 or HCO3 center dot SO4 types, whereas the groundwater in the irrigation district could be characterized by complex water types and high TDS. Stable isotopes of hydrogen and oxygen indicated that the groundwater in the irrigation district experienced strong evaporation. The calculated groundwater residence time showed that it takes approximately 2180 years for the groundwater to flow through the irrigation district. Some old irrigation water was present, and it influenced the current groundwater chemistry in the study area. The processes forming the current groundwater chemistry in the irrigation district can be formulated as: mixing -> evaporation -> water-rock interaction. For mixing, the proportions of rainfall, irrigation water from the Jing River, and lateral recharge from the nonirrigated areas were found to be approximately 30%, 49%, and 21%, respectively. For evaporation, the ratio based on the TDS was 3.83 when comparing the groundwater in the irrigation district with the mixed water after evaporation. Hydrogeochemical modeling showed that the irrigation area is a potential carbon source. The dissolution of halite and gypsum, the precipitation of calcite and dolomite, CO2 degassing and Na-Ca exchange are the main chemical reactions in the geochemical evolution of groundwater. The lesson learned from this irrigation district is that long-term irrigation will lead to salinization and complexity of the groundwater. Hence, in the water resource management of irrigation districts, attention should not only be paid to the balance of water quantity, but also to the balance of salts and the hydrochemical evolution of groundwater.									4	0	0	0	2	0	4			0022-1694	1879-2707		WOS:000752577400004

Herein, we directly constructed a 3D nanoarchitectured turbostratic delta-MnOx on carbon nanotube-modified nickel foam (MnOx/CNT/NF) by electrodeposition and a subsequent annealing process. The MnOx/CNT/NF electrode gives a benchmark catalytic current density (10 mA cm(-2)) at an overpotential (h) of 270 mV under alkaline conditions. A steady current density of 19 mAcm(-2) is obtained during electrolysis at 1.53 V for 1.0 h. To the best of our knowledge, this work represents the most efficient manganese-oxide-based water oxidation electrode and demonstrates that manganese oxides, as a structural and functional model of oxygen-evolving complex (OEC) in Photosystem II, can also become comparable to those of most Niand Co-based catalysts.									12	1	0	0	0	0	12			1864-5631	1864-564X		WOS:000416158500023	28675680

Here, we report 2D GaN/SiC-based multilayer van der Waals heterostructures for hydrogen evolution and visible-light water splitting by using state-of-the-art hybrid density functional theory. We uncover that Bi-GaN/Bi-SiC owns two advantageous features for water decomposition: a type-II heterojunction and suitable band gap (2.05 eV). We demonstrate that the layer number plays a crucial role in the GaN/SiC-based composites. The type-II heterojunction is attributed to weak interlayer hybridization caused by multilayer SiC. Reduction of the band gap is attributed to lattice constant variation and interlayer interaction caused by the multilayer structure. Moreover, Bi-GaN/Bi-SiC shows the highest visible-light absorption coefficient on the whole, and exhibits an appropriate band gap that straddles the redox potential of water splitting at pH = 7. This work suggests that the band structure can be regulated by adjusting the number of GaN and SiC monolayers, providing theoretical guidance for experimental synthesis of GaN/SiC heterojunctions for hydrogen production.									7	1	0	0	0	0	8			2044-4753	2044-4761		WOS:000649070900004

Aluminum anodizing experiments were performed to demonstrate the effectiveness of phase-shifting curvature interferometry as a new technique for high-resolution in situ stress measurement. This method uses interferometry to monitor surface curvature changes, from which stress evolution is inferred. Phase-shifting of the reflected beams enhanced measurement sensitivity, and the separation of the optical path from the electrochemical cell in the present system provided increased stability. Curvature changes as small as 10(-3) km(-1) were detected, at least comparable to the resolution of state-of-the-art multiple beam deflectometry. It was demonstrated that small curvature change rates of 10(-3) km(-1) s(-1) could be reliably measured, indicating that the technique can be applied to bulk samples. The dependence of the stress change during anodizing on current density (tensile at low current density, but increasingly compressive at higher current densities) was quantitatively consistent with earlier multiple-beam deflectometry measurements. The close similarity between the results of these different high-resolution measurements helps to resolve conflicting reports of anodizing-induced stress changes found in the literature.

They are not limited by the Carnot efficiency granting theoretical efficiency of up to 100% as per Gibbs free energy and enthalpy of formation ratio. Direct carbon fuel cells (DCFCs) electrochemically convert the chemical energy of solid carbon-rich fuels directly into electricity with efficiencies approaching 90%. Once coupled with a high-grade solid carbon-producing solar methane cracking reactor, DCFCs would essentially produce a pure CO2 flue stream that is nearly capture-ready. Unlike most fuel cell types that employ gaseous fuels, DCFCs can utilize high-grade carbon derived from solar methane cracking reactors, allowing for nearly complete fuel utilization with the entropy change. Thus the reversible heat of the cell reaction is practically zero eliminating the need for cooling and heating in steady-state operation. Therefore, they have the potential to leapfrog the technical evolution process towards achieving clean power generation with dramatically higher efficiencies and lower emissions by producing a nearly pure CO2 flue stream that is practically capture-ready. However, despite their advantages, DCFCs experience a complication with respect to solid carbon fuel impurities and ash content of the feedstock. This paper provides a concise overview of recent advances in DCFC technology and elaborates on the potential of high-grade carbon produced from solar methane cracking for use as a fuel in DCFCs. The paper demonstrates a promising system coupling DCFCs with solar methane cracking reactors and lays out the challenges of the proposed system, including carbon agglomeration, deposition, and solar reactor clogging problems.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			1364-0321	1879-0690		WOS:000798424200003

Herein, a facile migration-prevention strategy is developed involving the incorporation of polyaniline (PANI) into the pores of iron porphyrinic-based MOF PCN-224(Fe) and followed by pyrolysis to obtain the single-atom Fe implanted N-doped porous carbons material PANI@PCN-224(Fe)-900. The introduced PANI inside the pores of PCN-224(Fe) not only served as protective fences to prevent the aggregation of the iron species during thermal annealing, but also acted as nitrogen sources to increase the nitrogen content and form Fe-N-x-C active sites. Compared with the pristine PCN-224(Fe) derived carbonization sample containing Fe-based particles, the carbonaceous material PANI@PCN-224(Fe)-900 without inactive Fe-based particles exhibited superb ORR electrocatalytic activity with a more positive half-wave potential, significantly improved stability in both alkaline media, and more challenging acidic condition. The migration-prevention strategy provides a new way to fabricate atomically dispersed metal active sites via pyrolysis approach for promoting catalysis.									29	4	0	0	0	0	29				2639-5274		WOS:000524980100015	31549046

Electrocatalytic two-electron water oxidation reaction (2e-WOR) with renewable energy inputs is an attractive route to produce H2O2, which avoids the energy-intensive anthraquinone process in industry. However, leveraging these advances requires the development of efficient and selective electrocatalysts to accelerate the sluggish kinetics. In particular, nanostructured engineering of nonprecious metal oxides offers a promising route for 2e-WOR. In this review, the recent progress on nanostructure engineering of various nonprecious metal oxides electrocatalysts for 2e-WOR is reviewed, along with remarks on the challenges and perspectives. The fundamental understanding of 2e-WOR by density functional theory calculations and operando characterizations is first given, followed by a discussion of diverse H2O2 quantification methods including ultraviolet-visible spectrophotometry, titration, and colorimetric strips, with special emphasis on their accuracy, detection limit and stability. Afterward, various strategies toward high-performance nonprecious metal oxides electrocatalysts including doping, defect, facet, and interface engineering are overviewed. Future challenges and opportunities for 2e-WOR to H2O2 are proposed finally.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			1614-6832	1614-6840		WOS:000825875800001

Herein, three-dimensional (3D) porous flower-like NiCo-LDH/Ti3C2Tx is facilely fabricated via the electrostatic self-assembly of metal-organic frameworks and Ti3C2Tx followed by the ion-exchange reaction. The as-prepared NiCoLDH/Ti3C2Tx-5 delivers a high specific capacity of 635.7 degrees C g(-1) at 1 A g(-1), and still remains 382.3 degrees C g(-1) at 20 A g(-1). Furthermore, the corresponding asymmetric supercapacitor coupled with activated carbons achieves high energy density of 44.6 W h kg(-1) under the power density of 852.5 W kg(-1), and indicates remarkable cycling performance (85.71% of capacitance retention after 10,0 0 0 cycles). The outstanding electrochemical performance is assigned to 3D porous structure and high electrical conductivity, which not only increases the contract area between electrodes and electrolyte, but also enhances the ion diffusion and charge transfer kinetics.

Here we report a new deep nitrogen-doped complex perovskite metal oxide Ba(Mg1/3Ta2/3)O3-xNy (denoted as BMTON) that shows a wide visible light response with an absorption edge of ca. 560 nm rather than a shoulder absorption. Various characterizations indicate that the greatly extended light absorption is mainly ascribed to the efficient nitrogen doping into the oxide precursor Ba(Mg1/3Ta2/3)O-3 (denoted as BMTO) that can be simply understood as lattice Mg partly substituted BaTaOx. Meanwhile, theoretical results demonstrate that the weakened Ta-O bonds of the oxide precursor by the substitution of Mg atoms with lower electronegativity than Ta atoms are responsible for the enhanced nitrogen permeation. After loading of cocatalysts Pt or CoOx, BMTON is active for H-2 and O-2 evolution under visible light irradiation in the presence of CH3OH and AgNO3, respectively. This work may open a new avenue to prepare nitrogendoped metal oxides with wide visible light utilization for potential solar energy conversion by choosing suitable precursor oxides for nitridation.									17	3	0	0	2	0	17			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000410597200063

The results showed that the organic functional groups in the kerogen pyrolysis mainly within the range of 350-520℃,and at this stage the Huadian kerogen of mass loss was the largest. The biggest mass fraction of mass loss accounted for 86% of the total mass loss rate,which had the best genetic potential. In the process of the thermal decomposition,the first decomposition was oxygen containing functional group and aliphatic structure, followed by the aromatic hydrocarbon structure,and the one with the lowest activation energy separated out first.

However, the fast electron-hole recombination and sluggish surface reaction retard it from getting satisfied performance. Herein, hematite nanorod arrays doped with titanium (Ti-Fe2O3) on the surface were prepared by a solution-based process. Because of one-dimension anisotropy and improved charge transfer property, the photocurrent density is doubled compared to pure Fe2O3 at 1.50 V vs RHE under simulated sunlight (AM 1.5 G) irradiation. Loading conjugated Ni(OH)(2)/IrO, cocatalyst further leads to about 200 mV negative shift of the onset potential and dramatic increase of the applied bias photon-to-current efficiency (ABPE). We find that Ni(OH)(2) can efficiently capture the photogenerated holes from hematite as a hole-storage layer (HSL) to improve the charge transfer process across the interface of hematite and IrO2 electrocatalyst. Furthermore, the stored photogenerated holes in Ni(OH)(2) can be utilized by IrO2 for water oxidation more facilely. This synergetic effect along with the efficient surface doping are proposed to be responsible for the enhanced performance.									136	7	0	0	9	0	138			1932-7447			WOS:000360415700005

The meaning and significance of Arrhenius log j vs. 1/T plots when beta = beta(H), beta = beta(H) + beta(s)T and beta = beta(s)T are analyzed. When the enthalpy DELTAH(not-equal) and entropy, DELTAS(not-equal) of activation are formally independent of temperature and beta = beta(H) or beta = beta(H) + beta(s)T, these plots are linear and yield DELTAH(not-equal) at a given electrode potential. When beta = beta(s)T, DELTAS(not-equal) is the principal factor controlling the reaction rate. Normally, DELTAS(not-equal) varies with temperature and no linear log j vs. 1/ T plots are possible. In this case log j vs. T, and not Arrhenius plots, are meaningful and should be used. The general case is considered when both DELTAH(not-equal) and DELTAS(not-equal) are functions of T. By separating temperature-dependent and temperature-independent terms in DELTAH(not-equal) and DELTAS(not-equal), the effective temperature-independent enthalpy and the effective temperature-dependent entropy of activation are defined. With such separation all three cases of beta can be accounted for.									29	0	0	0	0	0	29			0022-0728			WOS:A1993LV15300004

An extra conductive black, ECB, was the most active of the carbon blacks tested and had the highest BET surface area (1000 m2 g-1). The results of a detailed kinetic study of the above reaction, mediated by ECB, are rationalised in terms of an electrochemical model in which the Nernstian reduction of Ce(IV) ions is coupled to the irreversible (electrochemical) oxidation of chloride to chlorine, via the micro-electrode particles of the carbon black, with at least a monolayer covering of Ce(III) sulphate. In support of this model, the activation energy for the oxidation of brine on the surface of ECB, derived from kinetic data using the model, was found to be 30 kJ mol-1, which compares favourably to that observed by others for the oxidation of brine on macro-electrodes of graphite.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			0008-6223			WOS:A1993LK63900003

The changes in the water chemistry during the transfer from the river to the aquifer have important implications for the quality of the produced water. In this paper, we first describe certain features of the evolution of the water chemistry during bank-filtration in the case of an experimental site, part of a large well field (Seine river, France). Here, bank-filtration leads to highly reducing conditions in the aquifer. A conceptual and numerical macroscopic model of this evolution, focusing on nitrogen compounds, is then presented. The model is designed to simulate organic matter mineralization and redox reactions catalyzed by bacteria in the river bed sediments where water infiltrates. Growth and decay of bacteria are explicitly accounted for and a numerical solution is found with an operator splitting technique. The model is able to reproduce column experiments by von Gunten and Zobrist (1993) designed to simulate infiltration of organically polluted river water into an aquifer. A model application to the characteristics of the experimental site is also presented. Results of a sensitivity analysis highlight the importance of: (1) the flow rate of water infiltrating river bed sediments; and (2) the organic carbon content of these sediments, for the evolution of the water quality during transfer from the river to the aquifer.

Considering that hydrothermal pre-treatment accompanied with pyrolysis was a promising rote for sludge resourceful utilization, the dually catalytic effects of different iron conditioners on organics conversion in both phases were investigated in this study. The results showed that iron conditioners reduced hydrothermal temperature and time to prepare high quality hydrochar. Specifically, FeCl3 accelerated the aliphatics conversion into aromatics and FeSO4 tended to fix partial carbon in solid product. After hydrothermal carbonization, 50% ~86% Fe2O3 remained in hydrochar and then promoted organics thermal decomposition by catalytic oxygen-olysis. Although 62???91% iron from FeCl3 and FeSO4 dissolved in hydrothermal liquid, the catalytic action on hydrochar pyrolysis was more obvious, leading to lower reaction order and activation energy. Besides, the re-sidual iron in hydrochar from FeCl3 reduced with hydrothermal temperature and time, while iron distribution kept stable for FeSO4. In comparison, FeSO4 conditioner was more suitable for sludge thermal disposal. The hydrochar with high carbon content and reactivity could be received in the economical way.<comment>Superscript/Subscript Available</comment									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0960-1481	1879-0682		WOS:000859536200001

However, the dehydrochlorination kinetic of adsorbed TeCA on GO-based materials' surface is still unclear. Thus, in this study the dehydrochlorination kinetics of adsorbed TeCA on GO based-materials' surface was compared to the kinetics of dissolved TeCA in aqueous solution. The results showed that the dehydrochlorination kinetic constants of adsorbed TeCA on GO-based materials' surface (k(s-F)) were much greater than those of dissolved TeCA in aqueous solution (k(a)) due to the deprotonated surface oxygen-containing functional groups (e.g. -COO-, and -O-.) served as conjugated bases to catalyze the reaction. In particular, at pH 8.0 and 9.0, the kss values for GO (20 mg/L) were approximately 3 orders magnitude greater than k(a) values. Furthermore, the k(s-F) values of adsorbed TeCA for the low concentration of GO (20 mg/L) were always greater than that for the high concentration of GO (100 mg/L). The primary mechanism was that GO was apt to aggregate at high concentration, which enhanced the steric hindrance between.O-containing functional groups and TeCA molecular. Consequently, the interfacial effects of GO-based materials at their low concentration could strongly enhance the transformation of adsorbed TeCA in aqueous environment. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Liebl.). There were marked differences between seedlings and trees. In seedlings, CO2 concentration during growth did not modify the light response of photosynthesis or PS II activity. There was a single linear relationship between PHI(O2) and DELTAF/F(m)' in seedling leaves that was independent of the CO2 concentration imposed during growth. In contrast, this relationship was curvilinear in sunlit leaves of adult trees. In seedling leaves, the decrease in q(p) (i.e., the proportion of open PS II reaction centers) largely accounted for the decrease in DELTAF/F(m)', whereas the decrease in DELTAF/F(m)' in sunlit leaves of mature oak trees was dependent on both q(p) and F(v)'/F(m)'.

We report herein an efficient strategy to modulate the active site and adsorption behaviors of PdNi alloy nanoparticles (NPs) anchored on oxygen/nitrogen-doped porous carbon nanosheets (PdNi/NPCNs) through nanopore trapping. The competitive adsorption of PdCl42- and Ni2+ ions and subsequent reduction belowrmodynamic reduction temperature ensure the formation of highly dispersed subsize PdNi alloy NPs on the surface of NPCNs. More significantly, alloying of Pd with Ni not only provides abundant surface-active sites but also adjusts the adsorption behaviors of intermediates over PdNi/NPCNs because of the strong electronic interaction between the two metals, thereby considerably boosting the ECH performance for 4-chlorophenol (4-CP) removal. The complete removal of 4-CP (100 mg L-1) is achieved at 7.5 mA within 180 min, superior to that of monometallic Pd/ NPCNs and many previous electrodes reported thus far. The catalyst also exhibits boosted stability toward the ECH of 4-CP with five successive recycling runs. This study provides an effective strategy to fabricate highperformance electrocatalysts for ECH reaction, which shows great promise in potential applications.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000861361300002

Here, flocculent VS nanoparticle aggregate-modified NiCo2S4 nanograss arrays grown on a nickel foam (denoted as VS/NiCo2S4/NF) were fabricated via a hydrothermal method, and were applied as electrodes for overall water splitting. Clearly, the introduction of VS nanoparticle aggregates could modify the electronic structure and offer rich active sites. Moreover, strong electronic interactions between the interfaces of the flocculent VS nanoparticle aggregates and NiCo2S4 nanograss arrays could improve the conductivity and charge transfer capability. Thus, the as-prepared VS/NiCo2S4/NF exhibits outstanding electrocatalytic activity with overpotentials of 332 mV for OER at the current density of 50 mA cm(-2) and 187 mV for HER at the current density of 10 mA cm(-2) in a 1 M KOH electrolyte, being superior to most of the previously reported Ni/Co-based sulfide electrocatalysts. Besides, the two-electrode system consists of VS/NiCo2S4/NF for overall water splitting under alkaline conditions, and it requires 1.87 V to attain 50 mA cm(-2), and maintains this activity for at least 24 h. Our findings could provide an opportunity for the rational design of highly efficient bifunctional composite electrocatalysts towards water splitting.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			2398-4902			WOS:000669580900001

This reactivity can be slowed if the enzyme is reconstituted with Ca2+. For TMPD, data from EPR and X-ray absorption spectroscopy indicate that Ca2+ reconstitution restricts initial Mn reduction to a site which contains a Mn4+ atom. Dimethylhydroxylamine (DMHA), a much smaller Mn reductant, is unable to reduce the cluster under these same conditions, even though DMHA and TMPD can generate Mn2+ from the Mn cluster in the absence of Ca2+. These reductants differ in redox potential by about 300 mV, and it is likely that the higher potential reductant, DMHA (+550 mV), is restricted to initially reacting with a Mn3+ species that is screened by the Ca2+ atom and is incapable, in the presence of Ca2+ of reducing lower potential atoms of the cluster that do react with TMPD. Reduction of the reactive Mn3+ species by DMHA in the absence of Ca2+, however, subsequently allows reduction of the remaining 3 Mn. Such an arrangement of metals and potentials in the cluster is in accord with models for the site of water oxidation and for the structure of the Ca-Mn-4 cluster.									17	0	1	0	14	0	20			1463-9076	1463-9084		WOS:000224755500024

To determine binary transition metals that are highly active, Greely et al. conducted a simulation of 256 different binary transition metals. They demonstrated that BiPt, PtRu, AsPt, SbPt, BiRh, RhRe, PtRe, AsRu, IrRu, RhRu, IrRe, and PtRh could be used as efficient electrocatalysts for HER. However, only few of them are synthesized and used as electrocatalysts. In this work, we report the synthesis of the raspberry-like antimony-platinum (SbPt) nanoparticles (NPs) via a colloidal nanocrystal synthesis. These NPs exhibited efficient activity with a low overpotential of 27 mV to reach 10 mA cm(-2) in acidic media. We conducted long-term durability test for 90,000 s under an applied voltage of 0.5 V (vs. RHE) and cycling tests of over 10,000 cycles under an applied voltage of 0.1 to -0.5 V (vs. RHE). The high activity exhibited by the raspberry-like SbPt NPs may be due to the following reasons: (1) the raspberry-like SbPt NPs exhibited versatile active exposed (110), (100), (101), and (012) facets as efficient HER catalysts, and (2) as confirmed by both the density functional theory (DFT) simulation and experimental results, the presence of Sb 3d subsurface broadened the Pt surface d-band, which caused synergistic effects on water splitting. In summary, synthesis of the new colloidal raspberry-like SbPt NPs is essential to elucidate the fundamental properties of the nanomaterial and nanostructure design. This study could facilitate the development of Pt-group materials that can be used as HER catalysts.

Here a new in situ vapor-phase (ISVP) growth method is developed to construct the cocatalyst of 2D PtS nanorectangles (a length of similar to 7 nm, a width of similar to 5 nm) on the surface of g-C3N4 nanosheets. The 2D PtS nanorectangles/g-C3N4 nanosheets (PtS/CN) show an unusual metal sulfide-support interaction (MSSI), which is evidenced by atomic resolution HAADF-STEM, synchrotron-based GIXRD, XPS and DFT calculations. The effect of MSSI contributes to the optimization of geometrical structure and energy-band structure, acceleration of charge transfer, and reduction of hydrogen adsorption free energy of PtS/CN, thus yielding excellent stability and an ultrahigh photocatalytic H-2 evolution rate of 1072.6 mu mol h(-1) (an apparent quantum efficiency of 45.7% at 420 nm), up to 13.3 and 1532.3 times by contrast with that of Pt nanoparticles/g-C3N4 nanosheets and g-C3N4 nanosheets, respectively.

In the as-prepared CFO/CZS photocatalysts, the CoFe2O4 (CFO) nanoparticles were decorated on the surface of Cd0.9Zn0.1S (CZS) nanorods. The ferromagnetic property of the as-prepared CFO/CZS photocatalysts ensures their convenient recycling by an external magnetic field. CFO/CZS photocatalysts with the mass ratio of CFO to CZS of 7% showed the highest photocatalytic H-2 evolution activity, the rate of 350.2 mu mol/h, which is around 10 times higher than that of pure CZS with an apparent quantum efficiency of 27% at 420 nm. This remarkable enhancement of photocatalytic activity could be attributed to the highly efficient separation of photogenerated charge after the formation of p-n junctions. Moreover, as-synthesized CFO/CZS p-n junction photocatalysts showed strong magnetic recyclability and excellent photostability.									138	5	0	0	15	0	138			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000454137400048

The PCR cloning strategy allows for the efficient production of libraries of 100 000 clones by a modification of a megaprimer-based whole-plasmid synthesis reaction. The high-throughput screen includes colony lift onto a nylon membrane and subsequent lysis of NiR-expressing colonies in the presence of Cu2+ ions for copper incorporation into intracellularly expressed NiR. Addition of a chromogenic substrate, 3, 3'-diaminobenzidine (DAB), results in deposition of red, insoluble color at the site of oxidation by functional NiR. Twenty-thousand random variants of NiR were screened for improved function with DAB as a reductant, and five variants were identified. These variants were shuffled and screened, yielding two double variants. An analog of the DAB substrate, o-dianisidine, which is oxidized to a water-soluble product was used for functional characterization. The double variant M150L/F312C was most proficient at o-dianisidine oxidation with dioxygen as the electron acceptor (5.5X wt), and the M150L single variant was most proficient at o-dianisidine oxidation with nitrite as the electron acceptor (8.5X wt). The library generation and screening method can be employed for evolving new reductase functions in NiR and for screening of efficient folding of engineered NiRs.									19	0	0	0	17	0	19			1741-0126	1741-0134		WOS:000274343000003	20083495

This involves the conversion of ketones into esters or cyclic ketones into lactones by introducing an oxygen atom adjacent to the carbonyl group. The BVMOs offer exquisite regio- and enantiospecificity while acting on a wide range of substrates. They use only NADPH and oxygen as cosubstrates, and produce only NADP(+) and water as byproducts, making them environmentally attractive for industrial purposes. Here, we report the first crystal structure of a BVMO, cyclohexanone monooxygenase (CHMO) from Rhodococcus sp. HI-31 in complex with its substrate, cyclohexanone, as well as NADP(+) and FAD, to 2.4 angstrom resolution. This structure shows a drastic rotation of the NADP(+) cofactor in comparison to previously reported NADP(+)-bound structures, as the nicotinamide moiety is no longer positioned above the Flavin ring. Instead, the substrate, cyclohexanone, is found at this location, in an appropriate position for the formation of the Criegee intermediate. The rotation of NADP(+) permits the substrate to gain access to the reactive flavin peroxyanion intermediate while preventing it from diffusing out of the active site. The structure thus reveals the conformation of the enzyme during the key catalytic step. CHMO is proposed to undergo a series of conformational changes to gradually move the substrate from the solvent, via binding in a solvent excluded pocket that dictates the enzyme's chemospecificity, to a location above the flavin peroxide adduct where catalysis occurs.									66	4	0	0	42	0	69			0002-7863			WOS:000303696200039	22506764

Thus, carbonates are an essential archive of environmental and topographic histories of continental terranes. However, carbonate minerals are highly susceptible to post-depositional alteration of primary isotopic values via fluid-mediated and solid-state reactions. We propose a hierarchical suite of techniques to comprehensively assess alteration in carbonates, from essential and readily accessible tools to novel, high-resolution techniques. This framework provides a means of identifying preserved textures in differentially altered samples that contain high-value environmental information. To illustrate this progressive approach, we present a case study of Tethyan nearshore carbonates from the Paleocene Tso Jianding Group (Tibet). We demonstrate the utility of each technique in identifying chemical and crystallographic indicators of post-depositional alteration at progressively finer spatial scales. For example, secondary ionization mass spectrometry (SIMS) oxygen isotope maps of micrite and bioclasts reveal significant isotopic heterogeneity due to grain-scale water-rock exchange in textures that were labeled "primary" by optical inspection at coarser spatial resolution. Optical and cathodoluminescence microscopy should be the minimum required assessment of carbonate samples used in stable isotope analyses, but supplemented when necessary by SIMS, PIC mapping, and other yet untapped technologies that may allow distinction of primary and altered fabrics at finer spatial resolutions.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1				2296-6463		WOS:000627340100001

We report here an Fe-doped nickel telluride-nickel phosphide composite (Fe-NiTe-Ni12P5) in situ grown on a nickel foam (NF) substrate. Using a partial phosphating treatment of an Fe-doped NiTe nanosheet array precursor, the as-prepared Fe-NiTe-Ni12P5 composite demonstrates superior OER electrocatalytic performance with a lower overpotential, smaller Tafel slope, and satisfactory long-term stability in comparison to the benchmark RuO2 and recently reported transition-metal-based catalysts. The physical characterization studies suggest that a dense gamma-NiOOH nanosheet layer is formed on the surface of Fe-NiTe-Ni12P5 after the OER. Due to the synergistic effects among Fe-doping, NiTe, Ni12P5, and the newly formed gamma-NiOOH species, a high proportion of the accessible active sites are exposed, and the electronic structure of the catalyst is well modulated to optimize the binding strengths of OER intermediates, while the mass/charge transfer can also be promoted, thereby contributing to enhanced OER results. This work provides a simple and effective strategy for the design of highly active and stable OER electrocatalysts with multi-components by partial phosphating.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000802601400001

Therefore, the development of the tracheal system and its subsequent modification to support the function of firefly light organs are key to understanding this process. We employ micro-CT scanning, 3D rendering, and confocal microscopy to assess the abdominal tracheal system in Photinus pyralis from the external spiracles to the light organ's internal tracheal brush, a feature named here for the first time. The abdominal spiracles in firefly larvae and pupae are of the biforous type, with a filter apparatus and appear to have an occlusor muscle to restrict airflow. The first abdominal spiracle in the adult firefly is enlarged and bears an occlusor muscle, and abdominal spiracles two through eight are small, with a small atrium and bilobed closing apparatus. Internal tracheal system features, including various branches, trunks, and viscerals, were homologized across life stages. In adults, the sexually dimorphic elaboration and increase in volume associated with tracheal features of luminous segments emphasizes the importance of gas exchange during the bioluminescent process.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1932-6203			WOS:000843619700115	35648743

A systematic study on this topic can not only provide guidance for rigorous practices on electrochemical measurements, but also in-depth fundamental understanding on the mechanisms of the electrochemical reactions. Herein, nine types of metallic ions including Cu2+, Ni2+, Fe3+, Fe2+, Co2+, Mn2+, Zn2+, Ce3+ and Al3+ are intentionally introduced into the electrolytes with a controlled manner and their effects on electro-oxidation of water, 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) and glycerol are investigated in details. Among these metal ions, Co2+ has the most pronounced effects on H2O electro-oxidation while Cu2+ species displays superior activity toward HMF and glycerol electro-oxidation, but negligible effects on H2O electro-oxidation. Such a unique feature of Cu2+ can also be noted from electro-oxidation of other small molecules, such as ethylene glycol, ethanol and furfural. More importantly, the effects of metallic impurities are independent of the composition of the electrodes, only rely on the pH of the electrolytes. In-situ electrochemical Raman spectroscopy, control electrochemical experiments and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analyses reveal that the origin of impurity effects is attributed to the formation of hydroxides during the electrochemical measurements.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0013-4651	1945-7111		WOS:000736307100001

ML is an effective tool in automating the generation, processing, and interpretation of large catalyst datasets with superior properties than the conventional statistical approaches. Also, ML have enabled the identification of accurate data-driven models that have been used to establish key relationships between the features of materials and targeted catalytic performance, such as activity, selectivity, and stability. These advances have resulted in the development of efficient design or screening guidelines for solid-state catalysts with targeted properties. However, extending the existing ML approaches to obtain accurate predictions of catalyst performance or design strategies for high -performance catalysts still poses several challenges. In this review, we discuss the recent milestones on the application of ML for solid heterogeneous catalysis and present the limitations and challenges of ML in this field. We also discuss potential future directions for the effective use of ML in solid hetero-geneous catalyst design. (c) 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

Inspired by the porphyrin molecular photocatalyst, single-atom sites (FeN4) as triplet sensitizing sites were fabricated in g-C3N4 for the preparation of Fe-g-C3N4, which processes a long-lived triplet emissive state (tau(PH) = 4.93 mu s). But under realistic condition for the large-scale production of catalyst, single atoms are inevitable to sinter, resulting in the formation of other metal species. Therefore, the photooxidation of 1,5-dihydroxynaphthalene (1,5-DHN) and the photocatalytic E-Z Isomerization of stilbene were selected as the model reactions to evaluate the influence of various Fe species on the triplet energy transfer. It was found that Fe-N-4 sites promote the triplet energy transfer process, while Fe nanoclusters (Fe-0) promote the electron transfer and inhibit triplet energy transfer. This finding provides guidance for the rational design of photocatalysts to efficiently improve triplet energy transfer process and its application. (C) 2021 Elsevier Inc.

Developing acidic electrocatalysis system is of great significance for the separation of FDCA and improves the efficiency of the whole electrolyzer, which is limited by the availability of effective catalysts. Here, we report a TiOx@MnOx electrocatalyst, which can obtain FDCA precipitation in one-step in acidic media. The TiOx@MnOx catalyst with the active MnOx species confined in the acid-resistant TiOx nanowires, and obtained a consistent yield of FDCA precipitation in the continuous conversion of 100 mM HMF (similar to 24 % under the stoichiometric charge). Electrochemical impedance analyses and electrolysis experiments revealed that the catalytic performance of TiOx@MnOx is related to the concentration of HMF. Further research found that the electrolyzer, electrolysis potential, reaction temperature, and HMF concentration affect the yield and FE of FDCA. This work demonstrates TiOx@MnOx is a practical and inexpensive catalyst for the sustainable synthesis of FDCA in an acidic electrocatalysis system.									7	0	0	0	0	0	7			2196-0216			WOS:000582951400013

Due to its cost and scarcity, however, the sparing use of it has become the top priority in this field. In this contribution, we demonstrate the immense potential of coaxial arc plasma deposition (APD) as catalyst coating technology for water oxidation. Taking advantage of controllable pulsed plasma generation with high kinetic energy, APD enables the rigid coating of uniform and ultrathin Ir films on the substrate surface. The strong anchoring propensity of the films is observed, and thereby, unless the Ir loading is too little to overcome the catalyst loss and dissolution caused during repetitive electrochemical redox cycling for full electrocatalyst activation, the electrocatalytic performance of the films remains unaffected even after thousands of cyclic water oxidation testing. In this regard, we scrutinize the threshold Ir loading required to elude the entire loss of catalyst and report the threshold value as a result of an analytic investigation into the correlation between the number of APD shots and the resulting mass of the iridium loading.									13	1	0	0	0	0	13			1932-7447			WOS:000469292700044

J	Sharpe, GJ								The effect of curvature on detonation waves in type Ia supernovae								MONTHLY NOTICES OF THE ROYAL ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY				322	3			614	624		10.1046/j.1365-8711.2001.04119.x				APR 11 2001	2001	The effect of curvature on detonation speed and structure for detonation waves in C-O is investigated. Weakly curved detonation fronts have a sonic point inside the reaction zone. In such waves the detonation speed depends on the detailed internal structure and not on simple jump conditions. Hence, in order to obtain the correct propagation speed and products of burning, the reaction length-scales must be resolved in any numerical simulation involving curved detonations in C-O. For each value of the initial density there is a corresponding extinction curvature above which quasi-steady detonations cannot propagate. For densities less than 2 x 10(7) g cm(-3), where the self-sustaining planar waves are Chapman-Jouguet, and for realistic values of the curvature. the sonic paint moves from the end of silicon burning to the end of oxygen burning. Hence the effective detonation length, i.e, the length-scale of the burning between the shock and the sonic point which can affect the front, is several orders of magnitudes less than the planar waves predict. However, silicon burning, which occurs downstream of the sonic point, is increased in length by a few orders of magnitude owing to lower detonation speeds and temperatures. Therefore more intermediate-mass elements will be produced by incomplete burning if curvature is taken into account, Recent advances in detonation theory and modelling are also discussed in the context of Type Ia supernovae.									16	0	0	0	0	0	16			0035-8711			WOS:000168126300015

The existence of PMo12, at the molecular scale in the polymer network allows the formation of pomegranate-like Mo2C@C nanospheres with a porous. carbon shell as peel and Mo2C nanocrystals well dispersed in the N-doped carbon Matrix as seeds. This nanostructure provides several favorable features for hydrogen evolution application: (1) the conductive carbon shell and matrix effectively prevent the aggregation of Mo2C nanocrystals and facilitate electron transportation; (2) the uniform N,P-doping in the carbon shell/matrix and plenty of Mo2C nanocrystals provide abundant catalytically highly active sites; and (3) nanoporous structure allows the effective exposure of active sites and mass-transfer. Moreover, the uniform distribution of P and Mo from the single source of Mo2C and N from PPy in the polymeric PPy-PMo12 precursor guarantees the uniform N- and P-co-doping in both the graphitic carbon matrix and Mo2C nanocrystals, which contributes to the enhancement of electrocatalytic performance. As a result, the pomegranate-like Mo2C@C nanospheres exhibit extraordinary electrocatalytic activity for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in terms of an extremely low overpotential of 47 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) in 1 M KOH, which is one of the best Mo-based HER catalysts. The strategy for preparing such nanostructures may open up opportunities for exploring low-cost high-performance electrocatalysts for various applications.									461	26	0	0	23	0	467			1936-0851	1936-086X		WOS:000384399300082	27617483	
J	Popelkova, H; Im, MM; Yocum, CF								Binding of manganese stabilizing protein to photosystem II: Identification of essential N-terminal threonine residues and domains that prevent nonspecific binding								BIOCHEMISTRY				42	20			6193	6200		10.1021/bi0207115				MAY 27 2003	2003	The N-terminus of spinach photosystem II manganese stabilizing protein (MSP) contains two amino acid sequences, (KRLTYDE)-K-4-E-10 and (TYLE)-T-15-E-18, that are necessary for binding of two copies of this subunit to the enzyme [Popelkova et al. (2002) Biochemistry 41, 10038-10045]. To better understand the basis of MSP-photosystem II interactions, the role of threonine residues in the highly conserved motifs T(Y/F)DE and TY has been characterized. Deletion mutants lacking the first 5, 6, 7, and 15 amino acid residues at the N-tenninus of the protein were examined for their ability to reconstitute activity in MSP-depleted photosystem II. The results reported here show that truncations of five and six amino acid residues (mutants DeltaR5M and DeltaL6M mutants) have no negative effect on recovery of oxygen evolution activity or on binding of MSP to photosystem II. Deletion of seven residues (mutant DeltaT7M) decreases reconstitution activity to 40% of the control value and reduces functional binding of the mutant protein to photosystem II from two to one copy. Deletion of 15 amino acid residues (mutant DeltaT15M) severely impairs functional binding of MSP, and lowers O-2 evolution activity to less than 20% of the control. AT7M is the only mutant that exhibited neither nonspecific binding to photosystem II nor changes in tertiary structure. These, and previous results, show that the highly conserved Thr7 and Thr15 residues of MSP are required for functional binding of two copies of the eukaryotic protein to photosystem II. Although the N-terminal domains, (1)EGGKR(6)L, (8)YDEIQS(14)K, and (YLE)-Y-16-E-18 of spinach MSP are unnecessary for specific, functional binding interactions, these sequences are necessary to prevent nonspecific binding of the protein to photosystem II.									31	0	1	0	30	0	32			0006-2960			WOS:000183024200025	12755622

The key point in fabricating this catalyst is using HNO3-treated melamine, other than pristine melamine, as carbon and nitrogen pools to realize the complete nitridation of MoO3 to Mo2N nanoparticles of 4 nm size and at the same time to generate a nitrogen-doped carbon matrix to support these nanoparticles by thermolysis under an Ar atmosphere. The as-prepared Mo2N@NC exhibits excellent HER activity in 1 M KOH with a pretty low overpotential of 85 mV to achieve a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) and a small Tafel slope of 54 mV dec(-1), which is among the best for Mo-based compounds and better than those of most non-noble metal electrocatalysts to date in alkaline media. It is also much better than those of the incomplete nitride compounds (MoO2/Mo2N@NC) and the mixture of nitrides and carbides (Mo2N/Mo2C@NC) fabricated under similar conditions, from aspects of overpotential, Tafel slope, exchange current density, conductivity, active surface area and turnover frequencies. Therefore, Mo2N represents a new kind of very active HER catalyst in alkaline electrolyte. Also, this work provides an effective method to fabricate metal nitrides/carbon composites for other applications.									78	9	0	0	1	0	80			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000412800300046		
J	Cheng, Yu; Guo, Haoran; Li, Xinpan; Wu, Xiao; Xu, Xiaohui; Zheng, Lirong; Song, Rui								Rational design of ultrahigh loading metal single-atoms (Co, Ni, Mo) anchored on in-situ pre-crosslinked guar gum derived N-doped carbon aerogel for efficient overall water splitting								CHEMICAL ENGINEERING JOURNAL				410						128359	10.1016/j.cej.2020.128359		JAN 2021		APR 15 2021	2021	Rationally designing single-atom catalysts (SACs) is a potential strategy to reach efficient energy conversion as they combine the merits of both maximizing atomic utilization and minimizing the cost of the heterogeneous catalysts. However, when increasing the loading capacity of single-atoms, how to effectively prevent the aggregation of metal single atoms to achieve higher atom utilization efficiency is an urgent issue. Herein, we develop an in-situ pre-crosslinking method to prepare a series of metal single-atoms anchored on nitrogen-doped carbon aerogel (M-SA@NCA, M = Co, Ni, Mo) as high-efficiency bifunctional catalysts for hydrogen/oxygen evolution reactions (HER/OER). Thanks to the intrinsic chemical crosslinking ability between the metal ions and the substrate functional groups, these metal single-atoms can be effectively and stably anchored in the three-dimensional network as crosslinked point of the substrate, thus endowing M-SA@NCA with ultrahigh single-atom loading (Co, similar to 27.30 wt%; Ni, similar to 18.35 wt%; Mo, similar to 18.16 wt%), and therefore display more active sites, and excellent stability (up to 100 h for water-splitting in 1.0 M KOH). Furthermore, the systematic X-ray absorption fine structure (XAFS), in-situ attenuated total internal reflection (in-situ ATR spectra) and density functional theory (DFT) calculation are used to acquire deep insight on the bonding modes between metal single-atoms and substrates, and the influence of different configuration on the catalytic performance. The combined results reveal that Co atoms facilitate the formation of pyrr-N, and the optimal configuration is CoN4 in HER process with smallest onset potential of 12.5 mV, closing to the Pt/C (20 wt%); while the best OER catalyst is Ni-SA@NCA with NiC2N2-o-5 moieties, outperforming the benchmarked IrO2. This work provides a solution for investigating the interaction between single-atom-substrate configuration and catalytic performance, and represents a critical step towards the rational design and synthesis of SACs with extremely high single-atom loading, maximum atomic utilization efficiency and thus superior catalytic activity.									20	0	0	0	2	0	20			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000623398200001

Graphitic carbon nitride (GCN) shows fascinating potential in conversion of inert chemical bonds into high-value-added products. However, the low NH3 conversion efficiency in GCN leads to unsatisfied practical application. Herein, a defect-dopant strategy through introduction of nitrogen defects and boron (B) heteroatoms is proposed to boost NH3 production. The optimal catalyst shows enhanced photocatalytic activity with NH3 conversion rate of 435.28 mu mol g(-1) h(-1) under visible light illumination. The boosting NH3 production is owing to the synergistic effect of nitrogen defect and B dopant. The nitrogen defect is favorable for promoting the optical harvesting ability, charge carrier separation efficiency as well as N-2 adsorption ability. B dopant not only enhances N-2 adsorption and activation ability, but also maintains the high reduction ability of BNUCNx. Density functional theory (DFT) calculation shows that high adsorption energy for N-2 and longer N-N bond length of N-2 are simultaneously obtained in BNUCNx, contributing to NH3 production. Furthermore, the high molecular oxygen activation ability in BNUCNx shows great potential for environmental remediation. This work provides a pioneering perspective for enhancing photocatalytic N2RR through defect-dopant strategy.									43	1	0	0	10	0	43			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000551969200154

Resultant CNMCN was analyzedvianumerous techniques such as TEM, BET, XRD, FTIR, XPS, PL and DRS. The results revealed that the introduced mesoporous structure, cyano-group and N vacancy, could increase surface area, improve the separation of photoinduced charge and heighten light response capacity. These positive factors promoted CNMCN exhibiting better photocatalytic ability for splitting water, its H(2)evolution rate was around 14.7-fold more than that of bulk g-C3N4, and excellent continuous service capacity was also showed. Moreover, CNMCN had better performance than mesoporous g-C3N4, cyano-group modified g-C(3)N(4)and N vacancy modified g-C3N4. Apparently, this present study provides a new thought for preparing mesoporous structure N defect-modified g-C3N4, which might be applied in clean energy production and environmental restoration.									31	0	0	0	4	0	31			2398-4902			WOS:000573449300023		
J	Wang, Mengjie; Li, Jianhua; Shi, Huanhuan; Miao, Dong; Yang, Yun; Qian, Li; Gao, Shixiang				Wang, xiaoxiao/GQQ-2846-2022				Photolysis of atorvastatin in aquatic environment: Influencing factors, products, and pathways								CHEMOSPHERE				212				467	475		10.1016/j.chemosphere.2018.08.086				DEC 2018	2018	Atorvastatin (ATV), a second generation cholesterol-lowering drug, is detected frequently in natural water because of its extensive use and incomplete removal from wastewater. In this study, the photochemical behavior of ATV under simulated solar irradiation was systematically investigated in order to assess the potential of photolysis as its transformation pathway in aquatic environment. The quantum yield of ATV direct photolysis was determined to be 0.0041. Among various water components investigated, including pH, Suwannee River Fulvic Acid (SRFA), Fe3+, HCO3-, SO42- and NO3-, the major factors contributing to the indirect photolysis of ATV were SRFA and NO3-, and the co-existence of SRFA and NO3- showed no interaction in synthetic water containing the above water components. The results were further verified in natural water samples. Singlet oxygen (O-1(2)) played dominant role in the indirect photolysis of ATV, and the contributions of O-1(2) and center dot OH to the photolysis of ATV in the solution with optimum combination of water components were calculated to be 67.14% and 0.66%, respectively. Nine phototransformation intermediates were identified by liquid chromatography - time-of-flight - mass spectrometry (LC-TOF-MS), and the degradation pathways were speculated as hydroxyl addition, pyrrole-ring open and debenzamide reactions. In addition, the evolution of products in the degradation process showed that the ring-opened product P416 and hydroxylation product P575 still remained at a certain level after two days of photodegradation, which may accumulate and cause additional ecological risks. This study provides significant information for understanding the risk and fate of ATV in aquatic environment. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

It is quite common to see reports on the synthesis and design of several self-assembled nanomaterials for the application in the catalysis of various chemical, photochemical, and electrochemical reactions and processes. Nevertheless, a combined overview on the synthetic strategies for self-assembled nanomaterials has not been reported in any form in literature. Owing to the current interest shown and the future significance on the self-assembled nanomaterials, it is highly essential to have such an elaborated review on the progress and perspectives of synthesis of self-assembled nanomaterials and their subsequent application to catalysis of various chemical, photochemical, and electrochemical reactions and processes. In this review, we have highlighted various synthetic methodologies used so far for fabricating the self-assembled nanomaterials that includes LangmuireBlodgett method, layer-by-layer assembly, amphiphilic (artificial and bio) self-assembly, and template-free approach. Nanomaterials derived from the above mentioned methods in various catalysis reactions are also highlighted in detail with an emphasis on confronts and prospects in the field of materials self-assembling and its concomitant application to catalysis.

Air is often found in these plasmas and it can be either introduced deliberately as a precursor or entrapped in systems that operate in open atmosphere. In either case, the presence of small traces of air can cause a profound change on the composition of the plasma and consequently its application efficacy. In this paper, a global model for He + Air CAPs is developed, in which 59 species and 866 volume reactions are incorporated, and a new boundary condition is used for the mass transport at the interface between the plasma and its surrounding air gas. The densities of reactive species and the power dissipation characteristics are obtained as a function of air concentrations spanning from 100 to 10 000 ppm. As the air concentration increases, the dominant cation changes from O-2(+) to NO+ and then to NO2+, the dominant anion changes from O-2(-) to NO2- and then to NO3-, the dominant ground state ROS changes from O to O-3, and the dominant ground state reactive nitrogen species changes from NO to HNO2. O-2 (a) is the most abundant metastable species and its density is orders of magnitude larger than other metastable species for all air concentrations considered in the study. Ion Joule heating is found important due to the electronegative nature of the plasma, which leads to the fast decrease of electron density when the air concentration is larger than 1000 ppm. The generation and loss pathways of important biologically relevant reactive species such as O, O-2(-), O-3, OH, H2O2, NO, HNO2, HNO3 are discussed and differences with the pathways observed in He + O-2 , He + H2O, Ar + Air and pure air plasmas are highlighted. Based on the simulation results, a simplified chemistry set with 47 species and 109 volume reactions is proposed. This simplified model greatly reduces the computational load while maintaining the accuracy of the simulation results within a factor of 2. The simplified chemistry model is computationally much less intensive, facilitating its integration into multidimensional fluid models for the study of the spatio-temporal evolution of He + Air CAPs.									21	0	0	0	0	0	21			0963-0252	1361-6595		WOS:000460826700005

Given the absence of information on hemoglobin (Hb) function in hydrothermal-vent vertebrates, and the complex molecular and functional adaptations observed in hydrothermal-vent invertebrates, we investigated the oxygenation reactions of Hbs from the vent-endemic zoarcid Thermarces cerberus and the deep-sea anguillid Symenchelis parasitica from adjacent habitats.Electrophoretically cathodic and anodic isoHbs from S. parasitica exhibit radical differences in O-2 affinity and pH and organic phosphate (ATP) sensitivities, reflecting a division of labor as in other 'class II' fish that express both Hb types. Remarkably, the cathodic Hb (I) lacks chloride sensitivity, and the anodic Hb (II) shows anticooperativity near half-saturation at low temperature. T. cerberus isoHbs exhibit similar affinities and pH sensitivities ('class I' pattern) but much higher O-2 affinities than those observed in Hbs of the temperate, shallow-water zoarcid Zoarces viviparus, which, unless compensated, reveals markedly higher blood O-2 affinities in the former species. The temperature sensitivity Of O-2 binding to T. cerberus Hbs and the anodic S. parasitica Hb, which have normal Bohr effects, is decreased by endothermic proton dissociation, which reduces the effects of ambient temperature variations on O-2 affinity. In the cathodic S. parasitica Hb, similar reduction appears to be associated with endothermic conformational changes that accompany the oxygenation reaction.									14	0	0	0	9	0	14			0022-0949			WOS:000185040600027	12819275

PCC 6803. Polymerase chain reaction and sequencing analysis showed that the mutants had completely segregated. Deletion of the PsbX protein does not seem to influence growth rate, electron transport or water oxidation ability. Whereas a high light induction of the psbX mRNA could be observed in wild type, deletion of the gene did not lead to high light sensibility. Light saturation measurements and 77K fluorescence measurements indicated a minor disconnection of the antenna in the deletion mutant. Furthermore, fluorescence induction measurements as well as immuno-staining of the D1 protein showed that the amount of Photosystem II complexes in the mutants was reduced by 30%. Therefore, PsbX does not seem to be necessary for the Photosystem II electron transport, but directly or indirectly involved in the regulation of the amount of functionally active Photosystem II centres in Synechocystis sp.

Thus, revealing the specific carbon chemical structures causing the corrosion is of great significance to come up with ideas of avoiding the corrosion reactions and eventually to achieve high energy density by expanding the working voltage. In this work, a variety of carbon materials are analyzed with many characterization techniques such as X-ray diffraction, Raman spectroscopy, N-2 adsorption, magnetic susceptibility measurement, and temperature programmed desorption up to 1800 degrees C, to find out the origin of corrosion reactions in an organic electrolyte. While carbon crystallinity and porosity are not directly related to the positive-electrode corrosion, a good correlation is found between the corrosion charge and the number of carbon edge sites terminated by H and oxygen-functional groups which are decomposed and release CO. It is thus concluded that the H-terminated edge sites, phenol, ether and carbonyl groups are electroactive sites for the carbon materials used in the positive electrode of supercapacitors.									33	1	0	0	2	0	32			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000463819400017

The BiVO4 powder prepared by the photoassisted sol-gel method (called P-sample) exhibited 1.3-3 times higher activity in oxygen photoevolution reaction than that prepared by the conventional nonphotoassisted sol-gel method (called N-sample), indicating that the photoassisted sol-gel method is effective for improving the photocatalytic activity of BiVO4. X-ray diffraction patterns and UV-visible absorption spectra were the same between the P- and N-samples, whereas SEM inspection showed that the P-sample was composed of well-separated small-size particles, compared with the N-sample. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy inspection also exhibited that the P-sample had a thin surface layer containing Bi5+ and OH-. It is discussed that the high activity of the P-sample is attributed either to the small size of BiVO4 particles or a certain catalytic action of the surface layer containing Bi5+ and OH-.

Tungsten oxide (WO3-x) is a type of transition metal oxide that has rich substoichiometric compositions and possesses oxygen defects. These oxygen defects determine the photon-electron interactions in the WO3-x structures. Therein, WO3-x quantum dots (QDs) exhibit fast carrier-transport for photon-electron interactions due to their strong quantum-size effects. Here, we report the use of non-stoichiometric WO3-x QDs, as a model material, in combination with silver nanowires (Ag NWs) to study photon-electron interactions on the nanoscale. We demonstrate that the incident photon-to-electron conversion efficiency can be increased by 8.5% and that the dye photodegradation performance was improved by 40% in a WO2.72 QD@Ag NW (WO2.72 QDs supported on AgNWs) composite compared to those of individual WO2.72 QDs under simulated AM 1.5G light. Furthermore, the WO3-x QD@Ag NW composite exhibits both photocatalytic activity and surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) features, and the WO3-x QDs can be switched between a photocatalytic state and a SERS state by changing the stoichiometric ratio. The synergistic effects are ascribed to the plasmonic state of WO2.72 QDs upon light irradiation. This work provides new insight into the design of highly efficient transition metal oxide/plasmonic metal nanocomposites for photoelectric devices.									37	2	0	0	7	0	39			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000465361800042	30860537

In this study, UV at wavelength of 365 nm was investigated to degrade contaminants of emerging concern (CECs) in the presence of NO2- at environmentally relevant concentrations (0.1-5.0 mg L-1).

Contributions of UV365 photolysis, RNS, and HO center dot to CEC degradation in UV365/NO2- system were calculated, and RNS were found to be the predominant species that are responsible for CEC degradation. The second major contributor is HO center dot for the degradation of selected CECs except for the case of sulfadiazine. Impacts of water matrix components (including dissolved oxygen, solution pH, and natural organic matter) on CEC degradation in UV365/NO2- system were evaluated. Furthermore, evolution profiles of CECs and NOy. in UV365/NO2- system were tracked when actual water samples were used as background, and a simultaneous removal of CECs and NO2-. was observed. Transformation products of bisphenol A and carbamazepine were proposed according to the results of HPLC/MS and quantum chemistry calculations. Nitration induced by RNS and hydroxylation induced by HO center dot are main reactions occurred during CEC degradation in UV365/NO2-. system. Overall, UV365 is a potential technology to remove CECs and NO2- in aquatic environment when residual NO2- is present. Our present study also provides possibility for the application of sunlight to remediate water co-polluted by CECs and NOV. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

Li3Mg2NbO6 was used as a Li2TiO3 compensator to improve temperature stability. Scanning electron microscope observations and X-ray diffraction analyses were used to investigate the microstructures and crystalline structures of the ceramics, respectively. We demonstrated a correlation between macroscopic "dark hole" phenomena and the microwave dielectric properties (MDPs) of LT-LMN ceramics by analysing the valence states of Ti ions and the content of oxygen vacancies using X-ray photoelectron spectra. We continuously added Li3Mg2NbO6 to pure Li2TiO3 to form MDCs, and found that at x = 0.04, (1 - x)Li2TiO3-xLi(3)Mg(2)NbO(6) ceramics achieved a near-zero resonance-frequency temperature coefficient (tau(f)). 0.96Li(2)TiO(3)-xLi(3)Mg(2)NbO(6) ceramics sintered at 1250 degrees C had excellent MDP values: appropriate permittivity (epsilon(r)) = 19.12, high quality factors (Q x f) = 70814 GHz (at 6.105 GHz), and tau(f) = 2.6 ppm/degrees C. This indicates that LT-LMN ceramics are promising materials for high-selectivity microwave ceramic dielectric substrates.									16	1	0	0	0	0	16			0272-8842	1873-3956		WOS:000519661800164

The effects of DO concentration on pentachlorophenol (PCP) reduction and its microbial community were investigated in a coupled anaerobic and aerobic reactor. Both the diversity and the dynamicity of the Eubacteria and Archaea community, which were responsible for PCP degradation, were evaluated by means of amplification by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and separation using the denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) technique. The results demonstrated a major shift in the Eubacteria and Archaea community as the mixed aerobic and anaerobic seeding sludge (1:1 by volume) developed into coupled granules and finally acclimated with PCP throughout the experiment period within 60 days. The numbers of the Eubacteria population decreased from 20, 16 to 11; Shannon diversity index decreased from 2.75, 2.53 to 2.10. In contrast, the number of the Archaea population increased from 12, 14 to 18; and Shannon diversity index increased from 1.87, 1.88 to 2.43. Phylogenetic analysis based on 16SrDNA genes showed the dominance Sphingomonas, Desulfobulbus, Proteobacteria, Actinobacterium, Methanogenic and some uncultured bacteria in the PCP-degrading coupled granules. Microorganism community construction of coupled granules was also deduced.									15	2	0	0	10	0	17			0273-1223	1996-9732		WOS:000264598100017	19273898

The anodic Cu2O and CuO nanowires or nanoneedles are attractive photo- and electrocatalysts since they show wide array of desired electronic and morphological features, such as highly-developed surface area. In CO2 electrochemical reduction reaction (CO2RR) copper and copper-based nanostructures indicate unique adsorption properties to crucial reaction intermediates. Furthermore, anodized copper-based materials enable formation of C2+ hydrocarbons and alcohols with enhanced selectivity. Moreover, anodic copper oxides provide outstanding turnover frequencies in electrochemical methanol oxidation at lowered overpotentials. Therefore, they can be considered as precious metals electrodes substituents in direct methanol fuel cells. Additionally, due to the presence of Cu(III)/Cu(II) redox couple, these materials find application as electrodes for non-enzymatic glucose sensors. In photoelectrochemistry, Cu2O-CuO heterostructures of anodic copper oxides with highly-developed surface area are attractive for water splitting. All the above-mentioned aspects of anodic copper oxides derived catalysts with state-of-the-art background have been reviewed within this paper.									14	0	0	0	0	0	14				2073-4344		WOS:000593031300001

Since the conductivity of catalysts is usually unsatisfactory, conductive carbon materials are needed in electrodes to provide the electron pathway. However, the effects of conductive carbon materials on the cycling stability of RZABs are usually overlooked. Herein, this topic is comprehensively investigated combing the electrochemical testes, in-situ oxygen monitor during charging, and characterization of the electrodes and electrolytes. Three kinds of electrodes made of bi-functional catalysts without additional carbon (N/A) and with Vulcan carbon (VC) and carbon nanotubes (CNT) are taken as examples. The results show that the CNT-based electrode releases the most oxygen under the same charging current density, which is 1.43 times that of the VC-based electrode and exhibits high stability in terms of voltage profile, structure morphology, and surface state. In addition, carbon corrosion is a serious issue for RZABs, which not only decreases the oxygen releasing efficiency but also contaminates the electrolyte. This work demonstrates the significant roles of conductive carbon materials in cycling stability and indicates that the in-situ gas analysis is essential to more rigorously evaluate the charging performance of RZABs.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			0363-907X	1099-114X		WOS:000743326200001		
J	KHMARA, LA								PROBLEMS OF MODELING WATER BIOPHOTOLYSIS IN MOLECULAR PHOTOCATALYTIC SYSTEMS								BIOFIZIKA				35	6			940	951						NOV-DEC 1990	1990	Modern situation is discussed in the field of creation of molecular photocatalytic systems for transformation and storage of the sun energy modelling photosynthetic dissociation of water. The structure of molecular-organized systems on the basis of sensitized phospholipid vesicules with membrane-isolated catalysts of water oxidation and reduction was considered. The main attention is payed to the stage of water oxidation up to molecular oxygen, i. e. to the modelling of the Photosystem II. In this context development of the studies was considered beginning from modelling of water oxidation according to multielectron photosynthetic mechanisms in homogenous acid and alkaline media, as well as the works on producing molecular-organized systems of water photooxidation using monoelectron catalysts. Possibilities are discussed for creating molecular photocatalytic systems uniting the reactions of water oxidation and reduction, as well as the factors limiting closure of the redox cycle of the systems in the spectrum visible region. The structure of the catalytic complex of water oxidation in native photosynthetic membranes is considered. The main attention is focused on manganese-protein interactions in the water photosynthetic oxidation system, and manganese bonds with individual proteins of the oxygen liberation complex. Modern concepts concerning the structure of oxygen liberation are presented, as well as those related to the structure of the metal nucleus of natural catalysts of water dissociation. The most promising trends of investigations are determined on the basis of literature data.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0006-3029			WOS:A1990EP84900010

Even though much progress in the electrochemical cells has been made, the mainstream device architecture is limited to batch-type configuration which leads to increased volume and extra need of products separation. Thus, it is still desirable to develop an electrochemical cell with a monolithic device architecture. Herein, we report a monolithic electrochemical cell (MEC) consisting of Pt nanoparticles (NPs) and FeNi3/Fe3O4 hybrid NPs anchored to laser induced graphene (LIG) electrodes directly patterned on both sides of polyimide film. When serving as an individual electrode, Pt/LIG and FeNi3/Fe3O4/LIG exhibit overpotentials of 90 mV and 253 mV at 10 mA/cm(2) for HER and OER, respectively. When they are assembled as a MEC for EWS, it displays a voltage of 1.58 V at 10 mA/cm(2). This novel device architecture omits the need of multiple assembling steps for manufacturing the full cells. In addition, the rapid and continuous laser synthesis strategy is quite simple, economic, and easily scaled up, which offers numbers of advantages over traditional batch-to-batch methods and thus offering a universal route to fabricating MECs via in-situ synthesis of various electrocatalysts embedded in LIG electrodes for other electrochemical reactions.									12	2	0	0	0	0	13			0378-7753	1873-2755		WOS:000445317900006

This work proposes a novel and facile method for the controllable synthesis of thin-layered Co3O4 catalysts with graphene as a conductive matrix to further enhance the overall N2 fixation performance. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and synchrotron radiation X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) demonstrate that the sandwiched Co3O4???x/GO catalysts enable exposure of more coordination unsaturated active sites, resulting in numerous oxygen vacancies. With a higher conductivity and distorted crystalline structure, excellent electrochemical NRR activity is realized with a NH3 production rate of 5.19 mmol g???1 h???1 and a Faradaic efficiency of 10.68% at ???0.4 V vs reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE). The density functional theory (DFT) calculation demonstrates that introducing oxygen vacancies in thin-layered cobalt oxides could result in an increased density of states (DOS) near the Fermi level, which would accelerate the NRR rate-determining step. Charge transfer could be accelerated through a weak Co 3d???N 2p ?? hybrid bond with a lower energy level. No obvious performance decay could be found after six cycles. Furthermore, the sandwiched Co3O4???x/GO catalyst exhibits a low overpotential of 280 mV@10 mA cm???2 and an outstanding durability for the anode OER, even better than those of the benchmark RuO2. Such an inexpensive sandwiched transition metal oxide catalyst shows great potential in the field of overall N2 fixation.<comment>Superscript/Subscript Available</comment									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000859410700001	36109842

The microstructure of the as-fabricated samples was investigated using X-ray diffraction technique, secondary electron microscopy and electron backscatter diffraction and the mechanical properties evaluated through micro-hardness and wear resistance measurements together with nano-indentation. It was found that during HIPing the additive particles TiB2 have transformed into TiB needles which tend to decorate at prior particle boundaries of the consolidated powder particles to form a network structure. Under the same HIPing condition, the needles became increasingly coarser and agglomerated with increased addition of TiB2. The micro-hardness of the synthesized materials increased with increased volume fraction of TiB. Nano-indentation measurement demonstrates that the TiB network structure shows much higher nanohardness than the surrounding matrix regions. The friction coefficient of the synthesized composites decreased continuously with increased volume fraction of TiB, indicating improved wear resistance. High resolution transmission electron microscopy analysis on wear debris revealed the formation of a series of oxides suggesting that chemical reaction between alloy elements and oxygen in air may have happened. It is thus believed that the wearing of the current samples is a result of both friction and chemical reaction. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

A plethora of photocatalysts have been investigated to obtain hydrogen and oxygen from water and solar light in the last decades. However, the photonto-hydrogen molecule conversion is still far from allowing real implementation of solar fuels. Here we show that 111 facet-oriented gold nanoplatelets on multilayer graphene films deposited on quartz is a highly active photocatalyst for simulated sunlight overall water splitting into hydrogen and oxygen in the absence of sacrificial electron donors, achieving hydrogen production rate of 1.2 mol(H2) per g(composite) per h. This photocatalytic activity arises from the gold preferential orientation and the strong gold-graphene interaction occurring in the composite system.									100	4	0	0	6	0	100			2041-1723			WOS:000377385600001	27264495

In this regard we have synthesized and modified Zr-based MOF i.e. UiO-66, UiO-66-NH2 and Au/UiO-66-NH2 by hydrothermal method and tested its efficiency towards H-2 evolution. The synthesized photocatalyst were well characterized by XRD, FTIR, UV-Vis and Electrochemical analysis to determine their structural and electro chemical properties. The analysis result confirms the successful synthesis of these photocatalyst and reveals the enhanced photo catalytic efficiency of Au/UiO-66-NH2. The rate of H-2 evolution was observed in the order Au/UiO-66-NH2 > UiO-66-NH2 > UiO-66. This can be attributed to the strong LSPR effect of noble metal Au and the enhanced visible light absorption capacity of linker due to the presence of - NH2 group. The Au nanoparticles acts as an electron collector from the conduction band of photo excited UiO-66-NH2 and hence inhibits the first recombination of electron-hole pairs. The photogenerated electrons accumulated on Au surface readily facilitate H-2 production by reduction of H2O molecule. The maximum H-2 evolution observed for Au/UiO-66-NH2 was 387 mu mol/h. The observed photocatalytic performance of H-2 evolution will provide an advantageous blue print for the fabrication of noble metals on MOF surface towards the future photocatalytic applications.

The vast majority of such systems, e. g. electrophoretic separations (capillary electrophoresis) or electroosmotic pumps (EOPs), employ electrolysis of the solvent in these reactions. In many cases, the electrolytic products, such as H+ and OH- in the case of water, can negatively influence the chemical or biological species being transported or separated, and gaseous products such as O-2 and H-2 can break the electrochemical circuit in microfluidic devices. This article presents an EOP that employs the oxidation/reduction of the conjugated polymer poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene), rather than electrolysis of a solvent, to drive flow in a capillary. Devices made with poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) electrodes are compared with devices made with Pt electrodes in terms of flow and local pH change at the electrodes. Furthermore, we demonstrate that flow is driven for applied potentials under 2 V, and the electrodes are stable for potentials of at least 100 V. Electrochemically active electrodes like those presented here minimize the disadvantage of integrated EOP in, e. g. lab-on-a-chip applications, and may open new possibilities, especially for battery-powered disposable point-of-care devices.									42	0	0	0	14	0	47			0173-0835	1522-2683		WOS:000288602000019	21425174

J	VOSS, C; KRUSE, N								FIELD-ION MICROSCOPY DURING AN OSCILLATING SURFACE-REACTION - NO/H-2 ON PT								APPLIED SURFACE SCIENCE				87-8	1-4			127	133		10.1016/0169-4332(94)00482-X				MAR 1995	1995	The reduction of nitric oxide with hydrogen on Pt field emitter tips was studied by means of field ion microscopy (FIM) in the temperature range of 440 to 530 K and at total pressures in the range of 10(-3) to 10(-2) Pa. Kinetic instabilities associated with the surface reaction could be observed in vivo by applying low viewing fields (usually below 9 V/nm). One type of experiment, performed at 444 K, was characterised by the appearance of striae and superimposed bright spots either stationary or moving with variable size. Mass spectrometric evidence was obtained according to which the dynamic changes in the local image brightness were due to variations in the NO ionisation rate brought about by the occurrence of water formation from adsorbed hydrogen and oxygen. A field corrosion process was suggested to be responsible for the occurrence of the striae. In another type of experiment, performed at 525 K, regular self-sustained oscillations with respective variations in the local brightness of the images were detected. The change to high image brightness was found to occur in an explosive manner (millisecond time scale) on planes formerly identified to be of {012} symmetry. After ignition, the spatio-temporal pattern evolution was seen to involve areas of the [100] zone until finally the central (001) pole was comprised. The catalytic cycle was found to stop after 0.1-0.2 seconds and to return in periods of some ten seconds with the identical pattern sequence. The oscillation mechanism is not yet known but likely involves a reaction-diffusion step, i.e. surface diffusion of reactants (NO or H-2) into regions of enhanced water formation. In addition, a field-assisted morphological change of the emitter tip was found to take place in the initial stages of the experiment. The resulting morphology was pyramidal and this shape must be considered a prerequisite for the occurrence of regular oscillations.					41st International Field Emission Symposium (IFES 94)41st International Field Emission Symposium (IFES 94)	JUL 11-15, 1994JUL 11-15, 1994		ROUEN, FRANCEROUEN, FRANCE	25	0	0	0	1	0	25			0169-4332			WOS:A1995QN33600021

This glycine residue occurs at the N-terminus of the ct-helix in the beta alpha beta fold that characterizes the dinucleotide-binding domain, in close proximity to the pyrophosphate bridge of the bound coenzyme. Introducing an alanine residue (G176A), the minimum possible change, at this position virtually inactivated the enzyme, as did the introduction of valine, leucine, isoleucine, glutamic acid, histidine, or arginine residues. Only the replacement by serine-a natural substitute for this glycine residue in some forms of mercuric reductase, a related flavoprotein disulfide oxidoreductase-produced a mutant enzyme (G176S) that retained significant catalytic activity. It is conceivable that this is due to a favorable hydrogen bond being formed between the serine hydroxyl and a pyrophosphate oxygen atom. In most of the mutant enzymes, the K-m for NADPH was substantially greater than that found for wild-type glutathione reductase, as expected, but this was accompanied by an unexpected decrease in the K-m for GSSG. The latter can be explained by the observation that the reduction of the enzyme by NADPH, the first half-reaction of the ping-pong mechanism, had become a rate-limiting step of the overall reaction catalyzed, albeit poorly, by the mutant enzymes. The marked preference for a glycine residue at the N-terminus of the alpha-helix in the beta alpha beta fold revealed by these experiments is in keeping with the view that the lack of a side chain at this position facilitates an electrostatic interaction between the dipole positive charge of the helix and the negative charge of the pyrophosphate bridge of the bound coenzyme. There was no evidence of a significant conformational change in any of the mutant proteins. Replacement of this glycine residue by alanine should act, therefore, as a safe diagnostic test for the involvement of a putative fingerprint motif in the binding of a dinucleotide by an unknown protein.									42	0	0	0	36	0	42			0006-2960			WOS:A1994NM26900008	8180198

The oxygen release behaviour of the t' and t" phases was very complicated. The single kappa phases, (Ce(1-x)ZrxO2) with the composition, x=0.5 and 0.6, which were obtained by oxidizing the resulting pyrochlore as a precursor in 0, gas at 873 K, enhibited a sharp oxygen release at the lowest temperature; the composition range of kappa phase may be x=0.45 similar to 0.65.

The results provide the oxygen and carbon monoxide profiles along the reactor axis. These data are then used in a numerical model, developed to determine the kinetic parameters of devolatilisation and oxidation of the pulverized biomasses. In order to simulate the gas phase reactions, the model also takes as input the composition of the volatiles of the tested fuels measured during pyrolysis experiments at 800 degrees C in the drop tube furnace. The model adopts different scenarios of particle volume evolution and different drag coefficient models in order to test their influence on the derived kinetic parameters. One of the volume evolution scenarios is a specific sub-model obtained by optical diagnostics of the combustion of the three biomasses in a previous study. Four other volume sub-models found in literature are also tested. For each of these scenarios, the model estimates close activation energy for devolatilization with a maximum variation of 2 kJ.mol(-1) from one scenario to another, while the activation energy of char oxidation is more influenced, varying by 14 kJ.mol(-1) with different scenarios. The five scenarios show similar gas concentrations and burnout versus the distance travelled by the particle. Nevertheless, this gives rise to a noticeable difference in the particle temperature along the furnace axis (+/- 100 degrees C at some positions), in addition to different particle velocity and residence time (similar to +/- 10%). The influence of the drag force is also studied using enhanced non-spherical model versus a spherical model. The non-spherical model leads to 10 to 14 kJ.mol(-1) higher devolatilisation activation energies and 10 to 19 kJ.mol(-1) higher char oxidation activation energies than the spherical model, along with a better prediction of the CO levels.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0016-2361	1873-7153		WOS:000640515600051

However, the conventional enclosed hollow nanostructures suffer from their large mass transfer resistance and incompletely exposed internal space. Herein, we develop a facile metal-organic framework (MOF) in-situ self-sacrificial template strategy for fabricating Co/CoO heterojunction stitched in mulberry-like hollow N-doped carbon (Co/CoO@HNC) towards oxygen electrocatalysis. The shell of Co/CoO@HNC is composed of N-doped carbon nanosphere subunits with abundantly dispersive Co/CoO heterojunction and open mass transfer channel. Benefiting from the abundant mass transfer channel of the mulberry-like hollow architecture and unique electronic properties by Co/CoO heterojunction and N-doping, as-fabricated Co/CoO@HNC affords more exposed internal space and accessible active site, thus facilitating the catalyst enhanced bifunctional oxygen electrocatalytic activity with a potential discrepancy (Delta E) of 0.83 V, far excelling the noble-metal-based Pt/C (0.99 V) and RuO2 (1.05 V). The Co/CoO@HNC based zinc-air battery (ZAB) renders a higher energy density of 920.5 Wh kg(Zn)(-1) and superior discharge/charge stability (over 250 h) than those of commercial Pt/C+RuO2 hybrid based ZAB (856.2 Wh kg(Zn)(-1), less than 100 h). The present work may offer a new way for engineering hollow materials for various energy-related applications.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000817892400004

In due of growing interest for hydrogen production by use of electrochemical technology. the extensively research of new cheaper electrode material currently are lead. At present production of industrial porous metal electrodes is mainly based on fabrication nickel HSE (high) surface area) electrodes by sintering, of nickel powder in oxygen less atmosphere or etching of Rancy alloy to Ni-Rancy electrodes.We proposed to use cheaper porous iron electrodes produced from iron powder instead of the expansive nickel ones. An inexpensive method of production is based on Successive oxidation and reduction of the iron powder bed.This work deals with kinetics of oxidation at 400 and 600 degrees C of iron powder bed in air and water vapor. Thermal effect during oxidation process was determined by DTA/TG analysis. Reduction process of porous oxidized precursor in hydrogen at 600 degrees C was also Studied.The surface morphology of the porous oxidized precursor as well as the received porous metallic iron Structure were examined by SEM. The chemical composition was determined by SEM/EDX and XRD analysis.The optimal condition (i.e. time, temperature) for fabrication process of iron porous electrode with highest Specific surface area and open porosity was appointed.The electrochemical properties of porous iron electrodes (obtained in different conditions of oxidation process) were examined by potentiodynamic measurement. The current-potential dependence was obtained in 1M KOH at 70 degrees C vs. Hg-HgO reference electrode i.e. in conditions corresponding with industrial process of hydrogen production. Hydrogen evolution reaction on iron in conditions mentioned above is considering with the Volmer-Heyrovsky-Ttfel kinetic mechanisms. For porous electrode and hulk sample iron and nickel electrodes the E-100 potential corresponding for evolution of hydrogen with current density 1000 A/m(2) was determined. E-100 potential is assuming 12 values from -1.24 to -1.32 V (depends of sample history) for porous iron electrodes. This potential for bulk iron electrode (-2.96V) and nickel (-1.50V) is significantly higher.									10	0	0	0	0	0	10			1733-3490	2300-1909		WOS:000260481200022

J	Dai, Anna; Huang, Zhenxiong; Tian, Li; Zhang, Ziying; Guan, Xiangjiu; Guo, Liejin								Phenyl-incorporated carbon nitride photocatalyst with extended visible-light-absorption for enhanced hydrogen production from water splitting								JOURNAL OF COLLOID AND INTERFACE SCIENCE				622				494	502		10.1016/j.jcis.2022.04.159				SEP 15 2022	2022	Developing and employing photocatalysts with extended visible-light-absorption has emerged as a fundamental issue for the enhanced capability of photocatalytic H-2 evolution from water splitting. Herein, a wide-spectrum light-responsive phenyl-grafted carbon nitride photocatalyst was synthesized. It was found that benzonquanmine-derived g-C3N4 (BCN) exhibits significantly extended light absorption (similar to 670 nm) compared with conventional melamine-derived g-C3N4 (MCN). Correspondingly, the photocatalytic H2-evolution rate of BCN (2846 lmol h(-1) g(-1)) is five times as that of MCN under visible-light irradiation. Particularly, an impressive H-2-evolution rate of 58 lmol h(-1) g(-1) could be achieved on BCN even under light irradiation beyond 620 nm. The outstanding photocatalytic H-2-evolution performance could be not only attributed to the enriched photons generated from the enhanced solar energy harvesting, but also to the distinctly inhibited rapid recombination of photogenerated electron-hole pairs resulting from the incorporation of phenyl groups. This work furnishes a new train of thought for the designing of carbon-nitride-based photocatalysts with enhanced capability of visible-light-utilization. (C) 2022 Elsevier Inc.

Only 4% of the world's water is fresh water, as most water sources have different degrees of salinity. As a result, billions of people face water scarcity, which isa global challenge. Desalination technologies that separate fresh water from solvated salt ions in saline water are attracting major attention. However, conventional desalination processes including thermally and pressure driven processes are highly energy intensive. To address this issue we demonstrate that the atmospheric-pressure plasma (APP) treatment of saline water can be a new potential alternative low-energy and green desalination route. Valuable salts are recovered by direct salt crystal precipitation within a short plasma processing time. During desalination and salt precipitation, plasma activated desalinated water (PADW) is generated and can be used for clean energy processes such as water electrolysis and sustainable agriculture by enhanced plant seed germination. In addition, functional nanomaterials can be extracted from the precipitated salt. The PADW exhibited a low salinity of 5.6 mS/cm with a low pH value of 2.1. The unique intrinsic PADW chemistries enabled electrochemical water splitting for both the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) at a Pt electrode and the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) at a RuO2 electrode. Moreover, the feasibility of using PADW in sustainable agriculture was demonstrated by enhancing mungbean seed germination using tap water mixed with PADW. At optimum mix concentration, both seed germination rates and germination percentages increased. Finally, we demonstrated the feasibility of synthesizing high-value 2D nanomaterials exemplified by Mg(OH)(2) nanosheets via a single step thermal pro cess using the salt precipitated from the seawater by the plasma process.

The processes governing its formation have been well studied, but the controls on the position of dolomitization fronts in ancient natural settings, particularly in a fault-controlled hydrothermal system (HTD), have received remarkably little attention. Hence, the origin and evolution of HTD dolomitization fronts in the stratigraphic record remain enigmatic. Here, a new set of mineralogical and geochemical data collected from different transects in a partially dolomitized Cambrian carbonate platform in western Canada are presented to address this issue. Systematic patterns of sudden decrease in the magnesium content (mol% MgCO3) and increase in porosity were observed towards the margin of the body. Furthermore, fluid temperatures are cooler and delta O-18(water) values are less positive at the dolomitization front than within the core of the body. These changes coincide with a change from poorly ordered, planar-e dolomite with multiple crystal zonations at the margin, to an unzoned, well-ordered, interlocking mosaic of planar-s to nonplanar dolomite in the core of the body.These phenomena are hypothesized to reflect dynamic, self-limiting processes in the formation and evolution of HTD dolomitization fronts through (i) plummet of dolomitization potential at the head of dolomitizing fluids due to progressive consumption of magnesium and fluid cooling; and (ii) retreat of dolomitization fronts towards the fluid source during subsequent recrystallization of the dolomite body, inboard of the termination, once overdolomitization took place. This new insight illustrates how dolomitization fronts can record the oldest phase of dolomitization, instead of the youngest as is often assumed. Formation of porosity is interpreted to occur as the result of acidification-induced grain leaching during the development of dolomitization fronts. This mechanism, coupled with retrogradation of dolomitization fronts, may help to explain the apparent enhancement of porosity in proximity to dolomitization fronts. (C) 2020 The Authors.

Identification, expression, and taxonomic distribution of alternative oxidases in non-angiosperm plants								GENE				526	2			275	286		10.1016/j.gene.2013.04.072				SEP 10 2013	2013	Alternative oxidase (AOX) is a terminal ubiquinol oxidase present in the respiratory chain of all angiosperms investigated to date, but AOX distribution in other members of the Viridiplantae is less clear. We assessed the taxonomic distribution of AOX using bioinformatics. Multiple sequence alignments compared AOX proteins and examined amino acid residues involved in AOX catalytic function and post-translational regulation. Novel AOX sequences were found in both Chlorophytes and Streptophytes and we conclude that AOX is widespread in the Viridiplantae. AOX multigene families are common in non-angiosperm plants and the appearance of AOX1 and AOX2 subtypes pre-dates the divergence of the Coniferophyta and Magnoliophyta. Residues involved in AOX catalytic function are highly conserved between Chlorophytes and Streptophytes, while AOX post-translational regulation likely differs in these two lineages. We demonstrate experimentally that an AOX gene is present in the moss Physcomitrella patens and that the gene is transcribed. Our findings suggest that AOX will likely exert an influence on plant respiration and carbon metabolism in non-angiosperms such as green algae, bryophytes, liverworts, lycopods, ferns, gnetophytes, and gymnosperms and that further research in these systems is required.

The metallic nature of MoO2 is confirmed by valance X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy spectrum and theoretical calculations. However, MoO2 itself shows only moderate activity due to the serious charge recombination, a general disadvantage of metallic photocatalysts. The findings suggest that its effective charge diffusion length L-p is smaller than 1.0 nm while the separation efficiency (sep) is less than 10%. Therefore, only the periphery of the metallic MoO2 can effectively contribute to photocatalysis. This limitation is overcome by integrating MoO2 in a hydrothermal carbonation carbon (HTCC) matrix (mainly contains semiconductive polyfuran). This simple chemical modification brings two advantages: (i) an internal electric field is formed at the interface between MoO2 and HTCC due to their appropriate band alignment; (ii) the nanostructured MoO2 and the HTCC matrix are intertwined with each other intimately. Their small size and large contact area promote charge transfer, especially under the internal electric field. Therefore, the separation rate of photoexcited charge carrier in MoO2 is greatly enhanced. The activity increases by 2.4, 16.8, and 4.0 times in photocatalytic oxygen evolution, dyes degradation, and photoelectrochemicl cell, respectively. The new approach is helpful for further development of metallic photocatalysts.									112	3	0	0	20	0	111			1616-301X	1616-3028		WOS:000379905800002

However, the high overpotentials required for charging Li-O-2 batteries lower their energy efficiency and degrade the electrolytes and carbon electrodes. This problem is one of the main obstacles in developing practical Li-O-2 batteries. To solve this problem, it is important to facilitate the oxidation of Li2O2 upon charging by using effective electrocatalysis. Using solid catalysts is not too effective for oxidizing the electronically isolating Li-peroxide layers. In turn, for soluble catalysts, red-ox mediators (RMs) are homogeneously dissolved in the electrolyte solutions and can effectively oxidize all of the Li2O2 precipitated during discharge. RMs can decompose solid Li2O2 species no matter their size, morphology, or thickness and thus dramatically increase energy efficiency. However, some negative side effects, such as the shuttle reactions of RMs and deterioration of the Li-metal occur. Therefore, it is necessary to study the activity and stability of RMs in Li-O-2 batteries in detail. Herein, recent studies related to redox mediators are reviewed and the mechanisms of redox reactions are illustrated. The development opportunities of RMs for this important battery technology are discussed and future directions are suggested.									212	17	0	0	5	0	213			0935-9648	1521-4095		WOS:000419033700019	29178214

Here, we demonstrate a scalable, one-pot synthetic approach to grow organic polymer films on the surface of the conventional copper plate under mild conditions. Molecular precursors, containing electron-rich thiophene and electron-deficient triazine-rings, were combined into a donor-acceptor pi-conjugated polymer with a broad visible light adsorption range due to a narrow bandgap of 1.42 eV. The strong charge push-pull effect enabled the fabricated donor-acceptor material to have a marked activity as an electrode in a photoelectrochemical cell, reaching anodic photocurrent density of 6.8 mu A cm(-2) (at 0.6 V vs. Ag/AgCl, pH 7). This value is 3 times higher than that of the model donor-donor thiophene-only-based polymer and twice as high as that of the analogue synthesized in bulk using the heterogenous CuCl catalyst. In addition, the fabricated photoanode showed a 2-fold increase in the photoelectrocatalytic oxygen evolution from water upon simulated sunlight irradiation with the photocurrent density up to 4.8 mA cm(-2) (at 1.0 V vs. Ag/AgCl, pH 14). The proposed engineering strategy opens new pathways toward the fabrication of efficient organic "green" materials for photoelectrocatalytic solar energy conversion.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000632069500051

These electrodes were subjected to an accelerated aging test, consisting of a succession of cycles of hydrogen discharge (HER) and open-circuit (OCP) conditions. In addition to monitoring the cathodic overpotential value during the aging test, visual inspection and mass loss measurements were performed on the electrodes at the end of the test to assess their stability. In the case of Ti:Ru:Fe (2:1:1), a large increase of the cathodic overpotential value is observed after 20 cycles. Adding O to the formulation causes a remarkable improvement of the long-term stability of the electrodes. As little as [O] = 10 at.% in nanocrystalline Ti:Ru:Fe:O (2:1:1:w) materials is sufficient for the electrode to show absolutely no sign of degradation after 50 cycles of HER/OCP, the longest accelerated test conducted. Adding more O to the formulation of the material does not lead to further stability improvement. A better stability under the conditions of the accelerated aging test can also be observed for nanocrystalline Ti:Ru:Fe (2 - y:1 + y/2:1 + y/2) materials with y > 0. In that case however, the level of improvement is dependent on the value of y. The best results are obtained for y = 0.75. A hypothesis is proposed to explain the improved stability obtained by lowering the Ti content and/or by adding O. The similarity and difference between both ways of improving the stability of the nanocrystalline Ti:Ru:Fe materials are also discussed.									8	0	0	0	0	0	9			0021-891X			WOS:000086962200012

Cyclic voltammetry allowed control over the surface coverage of monodisperse Pt nanoparticles in a simple fashion, as evidenced by the voltammetric response and atomic force microscopy of the resulting electrode surface. The Pt nanoparticle arrays formed in this way were electrocatalytically active towards proton reduction-hydrogen evolution. The methodology described thus opens up a new approach for the deposition of metal nanoparticles with controlled surface density for the investigation of electrocatalytic processes.

This is the highest value yet reported for dispersion of single metal atoms on graphene. Atomically dispersed CuN(4)moieties were confirmed by high-angle annular dark field-scanning transmission electron microscopy and X-ray absorption fine structure spectroscopy. The prepared Cu-SA/NGO shows remarkable activity and stability in the degradation of various organic contaminants at neutral pH. This excellent performance is mainly ascribed to the large number of active sites obtained from high single-atom-Cu loading. Density functional theory calculations confirmed that CuN(4)moieties serve as the active sites, with low energy barriers for hydroxyl radical ((OH)-O-center dot) generation. These supported single-atom catalysts (SACs) catalyze the heterogeneous Fenton reactionviaproton-mediated H2O2-homolytic pathway. This work offers a new method for fabricating various SACs with high loading levels for catalytic oxidation reactions.									50	2	0	0	6	0	51			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000548452100024

Chronoamperometric curves for PbO2 deposition reveals that the addition of nano-diamond particles could promote the growth of beta-PbO2 crystallites. This can be ascribed to the enhancement in the electrochemical generation of (OH)-O-center dot in the presence of nano-diamond. Additionally, the presence of nano-diamond could effectively improve the electromigration of Pb2+ toward the anode surface by the formation of negatively charged [Pb2+-nano-diamond] complex. The optimum doping concentration of nano-diamond for beta-PbO2 preparation was 1.5 g/L. As compared with blank beta-PbO2 electrode, Ti/SnO2-Sb/PbO2-1.5ND electrode has smaller grain size, more compact film and higher ratio of Oad/(O-ad+O-L). The electrochemical active area for Ti/SnO2-Sb/PbO2-1.5ND electrode was increased to 4.55 cm(2), while it was only 2.73 cm(2) for beta-PbO2 electrode. Notably, the oxygen evolution overpotential of Ti/SnO2-Sb/PbO2-1.5ND electrode was approximately 2.1 V/SCE, which was higher than blank beta-PbO2 electrode (1.81 V/SCE). The almost complete removal of methylene blue could be attained within 60 min at a current density of 30 mA cm(-2). Generally, the Ti/SnO2-Sb/PbO2-1.5ND shows promise as an efficient and low-cost electrode for electrochemical treatment of industrial wastewater.

Applying different electron accepters, taking electrons either directly from photosystem II (PS II) or photosystem I (PS I), the site of inhibition was localized within PS IT. Measurements of fluorescence induction kinetics and thermoluminescence suggest that the binding of NPPB to the Q(B) binding site of PS II is similar to the herbicide DCMU (3-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-1,1-dimethylurea). The effects of different arylaminobenzoate derivatives and other Cl- channel inhibitors on photosynthetic electron transport were investigated. The structure-activity relationship of the inhibitory effect on PS TI shows interesting parallels to the one observed for the arylaminobenzoate block of mammalian Cl- channels. A molecular modeling approach was used to fit NPPB into the Q(B) binding site and to identify possible molecular interactions between NPPB and the amino acid residues of the binding site in PS II. Taken together, these data give a detailed molecular picture of the mechanism of NPPB binding.									8	0	0	0	7	0	8			0006-2960			WOS:000167640200005	11258946

However, their practical application remains a major bottleneck due to the drawback of poor stability. Therefore, we design a simple and viable strategy for preparing a series of TiO2 @ATO@MOx (TAM, M = Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, and Zn) electrodes. The oxygen evolution potential, electrode stability, and electrochemical activity toward methylene blue (MB) were studied and compared. When evaluated as electrode material toward methylene blue (MB) oxidation, TiO2 @ATO@NiO (TANi) exerts an excellent degradation efficiency and service lifetime; these are the highest values among these TAM electrodes. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurements demonstrated that NiO can effectively enhance roughness factor and voltammetric charge, indicating a large electrochemically active surface area and abundant electroactive sites. The addition of NiO effectively lowers the charge transfer resistance and enhances the electrode stability. Moreover, theoretical calculations based on the first-principle density functional theory (DFT) indicate that the conductive property of TAM is manipulated by MOx adding and thus an excellent electrochemical activity is achieved. Based on the experimental data and computational simulations, our work brings new important insights that will contribute to the development of high-performance and stable ATO-based electrode materials.

However, their function and mechanisms of action remain unclear. Here we show that PRELI, a mammalian LEA-containing homolog of yeast Ups1p, can associate with dynamin-like GTPase Optic Atrophy-1 (OPA1) and contribute to the maintenance of mitochondrial morphology. Accordingly, PRELI can uphold mitochondrial membrane potential (Delta Psi(m)) and enhance respiratory chain (RC) function, shown by its capacity to induce complex-I/NADH dehydrogenase and ATP synthase expression, increase oxygen consumption and reduce reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. PRELI can also inhibit cell death induced by STS, TNF-alpha or UV irradiation. Moreover, in vitro and in vivo dominant-negative overexpression of mutant PRELI/LEA(-) (lacking the LEA motif) and transient in vitro PRELI-specific knockdown can render lymphocytes vulnerable to apoptosis, cause mouse embryo lethality and revert the resistance of lymphoma cells to induced death. Collectively, these data support the long-presumed notion of LEA protein-dependent mechanisms of cytoprotection and suggest that PRELI interacts with OPA1 to maintain mitochondria structures intact, sustain balanced ion(-)/proton(+) gradients, promote oxidative phosphorylation reactions, regulate pro-and antiapoptotic protein traffic and enable cell responses to induced death. These findings may help to understand how bioenergetics is mechanistically connected with cell survival cues.

We found that photoexcited chlorophylls, pheophytins and porphyrins are capable of reversible and irreversible oxido-reduction. The mechanism of the photosensitized electron transfer from donor to acceptor molecule is based on the reversible photochemical oxido-reduction of the pigment-sensitizer. This property of the excited pigments is realized in the reaction centres of photosynthetic cells when photooxidation of bacteriochlorophyll(s) or chlorophyll of Photosystem II is coupled to pheophytin reduction leading to the final charge separation.The studies of the state and function of pigments in the course of chlorophyll biosynthesis in cellular and non-cellular systems revealed different monomeric and aggregated forms of pigments and the phenomenon of self-assembly of various forms of chlorophylls, bacteriochlorophylls and protochlorophylls. The discovery of protochlorophyll photoreduction in non-cellular system allowed the study of the molecular mechanisms of this reaction.In order to construct models of photosynthetic charge separation, we used inorganic photocatalysts-semiconductors, mainly titanium dioxide, and pigments incorporated into detergent micelles or lipid vesicles. To prevent back reactions we used heterogeneous systems where primary unstable products were spatially separated; coupling of solubilized chlorophylls or semiconductor particles with bacterial hydrogenase led to molecular hydrogen photoproduction. Light excitation of some coenzymes, mainly NADH and NADPH, was considered from the point of view of early events of chemical evolution.Now we are interested in the creation of photobiochemical systems using principles of photosynthesis for the conversion and storage of solar energy.									8	0	1	0	6	0	9			0166-8595			WOS:A1992JV09700001	24408662	
J	Buchmann, Kurt					Buchmann, Kurt/0000-0002-2747-237X			Evolution of innate immunity: clues from invertebrates via fish to mammals								FRONTIERS IN IMMUNOLOGY				5						459	10.3389/fimmu.2014.00459				SEP 23 2014	2014	Host responses against invading pathogens are basic physiological reactions of all living organisms. Since the appearance of the first eukaryotic cells, a series of defense mechanisms have evolved in order to secure cellular integrity, homeostasis, and survival of the host. Invertebrates, ranging from protozoans to metazoans, possess cellular receptors, which bind to foreign elements and differentiate self from non-self. This ability is in multicellular animals associated with presence of phagocytes, bearing different names (amebocytes, hemocytes, coelomocytes) in various groups including animal sponges, worms, cnidarians, mollusks, crustaceans, chelicerates, insects, and echinoderms (sea stars and urchins). Basically, these cells have a macrophage-like appearance and function and the repair and/or fight functions associated with these cells are prominent even at the earliest evolutionary stage. The cells possess pathogen recognition receptors recognizing pathogen-associated molecular patterns, which are well-conserved molecular structures expressed by various pathogens (virus, bacteria, fungi, protozoans, helminths). Scavenger receptors, Toll-like receptors, and Nod-like receptors (NLRs) are prominent representatives within this group of host receptors. Following receptor ligand binding, signal transduction initiates a complex cascade of cellular reactions, which lead to production of one or more of a wide array of effector molecules. Cytokines take part in this orchestration of responses even in lower invertebrates, which eventually may result in elimination or inactivation of the intruder. Important innate effector molecules are oxygen and nitrogen species, antimicrobial peptides, lectins, fibrinogen-related peptides, leucine rich repeats (LRRs), pentraxins, and complement-related proteins. Echinoderms represent the most developed invertebrates and the bridge leading to the primitive chordates, cephalochordates, and urochordates, in which many autologous genes and functions from their ancestors can be found. They exhibit numerous variants of innate recognition and effector molecules, which allow fast and innate responses toward diverse pathogens despite lack of adaptive responses. The primitive vertebrates (agnathans also termed jawless fish) were the first to supplement innate responses with adaptive elements. Thus hagfish and lampreys use LRRs as variable lymphocyte receptors, whereas higher vertebrates [cartilaginous and bony fishes (jawed fish), amphibians, reptiles, birds, and mammals] developed the major histocompatibility complex,T-cell receptors, and B-cell receptors (immunoglobulins) as additional adaptive weaponry to assist innate responses. Extensive cytokine networks are recognized in fish, but related signal molecules can be traced among invertebrates. The high specificity, antibody maturation, immunological memory, and secondary responses of adaptive immunity were so successful that it allowed higher vertebrates to reduce the number of variants of the innate molecules originating from both invertebrates and lower vertebrates. Nonetheless, vertebrates combine the two arms in an intricate inter-dependent network. Organisms at all developmental stages have, in order to survive, applied available genes and functions of which some may have been lost or may have changed function through evolution.The molecular mechanisms involved in evolution of immune molecules, might apart from simple base substitutions be as diverse as gene duplication, deletions, alternative splicing, gene recombination, domain shuffling, retrotransposition, and gene conversion. Further, variable regulation of gene expression may have played a role.									298	5	2	0	243	1	307			1664-3224			WOS:000354449700001	25295041

In this study, we investigate the high-temperature properties of chemical vapor deposition grown molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) in different atmospheres through the ex situ and in situ morphological and spectroscopical characterizations. When the MoS2 is exposed to Ar, dry O-2, and wet O-2 at the temperature of 500, 350, and 300 ?, the etching process starts at the edge and inner regions simultaneously, and the etched trenches are opposite to the outline of the MoS2 triangular shape. We observe a clear redshift of MoS2 in the Raman peak position and the photoluminescence peak position by in situ spectroscopical characterizations as the temperature increases. Moreover, a strong photoluminescence enhancement of 24-fold of MoS2 is observed when exposing to O-2 at 300 ?. This should be due to the chemical and physical adsorbed oxygen on the MoS2 surface. Moreover, we find that physical adsorption can be eliminated after vacuum annealing. This study provides a real-time strategy to study the morphology and property evolution of 2D materials at high temperature in different atmospheres. These results will contribute to the applications in future electronic and optoelectronic functional devices of 2D materials.

J	Yang, Jing; Jiang, Shun-Feng; Hu, Wei-Fei; Jiang, Hong								Highly efficient electrochemical dechlorination of florfenicol by an ultrathin molybdenum disulfide cathode								CHEMICAL ENGINEERING JOURNAL				427						131600	10.1016/j.cej.2021.131600				JAN 1 2022	2022	The efficient elimination of biotoxicity of halogenated antibiotics by electrochemical dehalogenation pretreatment is required by a subsequent biochemical treatment process. Molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) has been applied as an efficient catalyst for the hydrogen evolution and water splitting, without any investigation in electrochemical dehalogenation, particularly under complex environmental conditions. In this study, ultrathin MoS2 nanosheets are fabricated via a simple one-step hydrothermal process, and proved as a promising catalyst for enhancing electrochemical dehalogenation of halogenated antibiotics of a chlorinated antibiotic florfenicol (FLO) under relevant environmental conditions. Results showed that the reaction rate constant of the ultrathin MoS2 electrode (0.0135 min 1) was 4.1- and 28- fold higher than those of commercial MoS2 and bare carbon paper, respectively, and the biotoxicity of treated effluent could almost be neglected. Free radical scavenging experiments and electrochemical performance test suggested that the dechlorination of FLO on ultrathin MoS2 electrode was synergistically accomplished via the direct electron transfer and indirect reduction of active H*. Environmental conditions, namely, dissolved oxygen and humic acid had only a slight effect on the dechlorination efficiency. Electrochemical dechlorination of FLO was a gradual dechlorination process and FLO-2Cl (representing the removal of two chlorine atoms from FLO) was the final main product. Besides, the ultrathin MoS2 electrode retained a good stability and the energy consumption of the ultrathin MoS2 cathode at 1.2 V was 0.02643 kWh g(-1), more than those of commercial MoS2 cathode and bare carbon paper. This study develops a new application of noble-metal-free electrode material for electrochemical dechlorination in wastewater.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000769391400003

Variation in Phi(r) within the C-3 species was small with a mean value of 7.96+/-0.12 mol photon mol(-1) O-2, whereas the mean value for the C-4 species was 12.27+/-1.53 mol photon mol(-1) O-2, with the lowest value, 9.24+/-0.13 mol photon mol(-1) O-2, for the PEP-carboxykinase C-4 species Spartina townsendii. The C-3-C-4 intermediate species Panicum milioides had a value of 9.05+/-0.29 mol photon mol(-1) O-2, approximately 1 mol photon mol(-1) O-2 greater than the C-3 species. The possibility that this extra cost is due to PEP-carboxylase-dependent recycling of CO2 is discussed. No correlation was found between Phi(r) and chlorophyll content or leaf absorptance. Based on white (Phi(w)) and red light measurements of the photon requirement, values in red light were approximately 20% higher than white-light estimates. These results are discussed with reference to accepted mechanisms of energy transduction in thylakoid membranes (Z-scheme), expected inefficiencies and losses during light-harvesting and electron transport reactions, and the influence of respiratory processes.									8	1	0	0	7	0	9			0140-7791			WOS:A1994MU25300003

Haemoglobin of this species was fractionated into 4 components (2 minor and 2 major ones) by the disk-electrophoresis in polyacrylamid gel. The major fractions were eluted and their respiration parameters were investigated. One of them showed high affinity for O2 (P50 5.81 +/- 0.74 mm Hg at pH 8.3) and heightened sensibility to pH (Bohr effect amounted to -0.81 +/- 0.09 at pH of 8.3 --> 7.5) simultaneously. Moreover, an acidosis incubation medium (pH 8.3 --> 7.5) decreased its O2 saturation by 12.8 +/- 1.4% (Root effect). The level of this fraction increased by 41.8% (p < 0.001) under the experimental hypoxia conditions (seawater O2 concentration range was 1.7-1.8 mg 1(-1); exposition--10 days). It affected blood respiration parameters and reflected the process of adaptation of this species to oxygen deficiency. The nucleotidtriphosphate level in red blood cells did not change. Swelling of circulated erythrocytes was observed simultaneously.									5	0	3	0	8	0	10						MEDLINE:19621744	19621744

Herein, systematic first-principles computations demonstrate that the synergy of anion-oxygen and cation-manganese vacancies (V-O and V-Mn) in manganese dioxide (MnO2) nanosheets results in abnormal local lattice distortion and electronic modulation. Such alterations enrich the accessible active centers, increase conductivity, enhance the water dissociation step, and favor intermediate adsorption-desorption, consequently promoting HER and OER kinetics. As proof of concept, robust electrocatalysts, MnO2 ultrathin nanosheets doped with dual vacancies (DV-MnO2) are obtained via a maturely chemical strategy. Detailed characterizations confirm the cation vacancies-V-Mn contribute to enhanced conductivity and anion vacancies-V-O enrich the active centers with optimized local electronic configurations, consistent with the simulative predictions. As expected, DV-MnO2 exhibits exceptional bifunctionality with the strong assistance of synergetic dual vacancies which act as abundant "hot spots" for active multiple intermediates. Leading to a lower cell voltage (1.55 V) in alkali electrolyte is required to reach 10 mA cm(-2) for the overall water splitting system. These atomic-level insights on synergetic DV can favor the development of activating strategy from inert electrocatalysts.									20	0	0	0	6	0	20			1616-301X	1616-3028		WOS:000628741400001

The one-humped camel (Camelus dromedarius) is adapted to live in the widely varying arid climate and in many intrinsic and extrinsic ROS producing agents. Studying the MnSOD in C. dromedarius could help understand the impact of exposure to such factors on the health status of camel. The coding sequence of MnSOD of C. dromedarius (cSOD2) was amplified by reverse transcription PCR from the liver. The cDNA sequencing revealed an open reading frame of 666 nucleotides encoding a protein of 222 amino acids which is comparable to the SOD2 genes from many eukaryotic organisms. The calculated molecular weight and isoelectric point of cSOD2 were 24.6 kDa and 8.15, respectively. The amino acid sequence analysis revealed the presence of the mitochondria targeting sequence at the N-terminus, the conservation of the characteristic MnSOD motif signature and the four manganese binding sites in cSOD2. The alignment and phylogenetic analysis of the cSOD2 with sequences from 18 organisms indicated that cSOD2 groups with mammals which took late evolutionary line different from SOD2 from birds, amphibians, fish and invertebrates.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0030-9923			WOS:000363003500014

The virus was detected by RTPCR directly from nasopharyngeal swabs and/or from supernatants after cell culture. Children infected with hMPV were mostly younger than one year of age (67%), all presenting with fever and cough. The main cause for hospitalization was the need for oxygen therapy (73%). Four hMPV positive children had an identifiable co-morbid condition but had a similar clinical evolution when compared to previously healthy infants. Chest radiography showed an increase in interstitial infiltrates with focal consolidation in 6 children. Obstructive bronchial syndrome and bronchiolitis, with or without pneumonia, were the most frequent diagnosis associated with hMPV positivity. A rapid and sensitive diagnostic method is required to improve diagnosis and treatment of these patients.									4	0	0	0	1	6	9			0716-1018	0717-6341		WOS:000254121200003	17369966

Herein, we show that a simple in situ electrochemical tuning method can be used to turn Co(OH)(x)(CO3)(0.5(2-x)) crystals into interconnected ultrafine nanoparticles with enriched grain boundaries. The grain boundaries offer numerous unparalleled active sites for highly efficient electro-oxidation of hydrazine. The electrochemically-tuned Co(OH)(x)(CO3)(0.5(2-x)) shows an onset potential (-1.12 V vs. Ag/AgCl) 180 mV smaller than that of the pristine Co(OH)(x)(CO3)(0.5(2-x)), and delivers a high current density of 62.4 mA cm(-2) at -0.90 V vs. Ag/AgCl, which is 27 times higher than that of the pristine Co(OH)(x)(CO3)(0.5(2-x)). This work produces the most active non-metallic catalyst for hydrazine oxidation with catalytic activity comparable to the state-of-the-art catalysts. Moreover, our electrochemical tuning method is applicable to other materials (e.g. Co3O4, Co(OH)(2) and Ni(OH)(2)).									5	0	0	0	0	0	5				2052-1537		WOS:000424050300021

Here, we report the use of a network of CdSe branched colloidal nanocrystals, made of a CdSe core and eight CdSe pods (so-called octapods), able to host on their pods Pt particles, which catalyze water splitting reactions. Thanks to the octapod shape, the resulting Pt-hosting network is mechanically trapped onto carbon nanotube buckypaper, providing mechanically flexible and binder-free electrodes. We found that such a hierarchical configuration maximizes the mass activity and the utilization efficiency of Pt for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). At a potential of -0.15 V versus the reversible hydrogen electrode, the Pt/octapod network-based electrodes display a Pt mass activity for the HER of similar to 166 and similar to 42 A mg(-1) in acidic and alkaline media, respectively. These values correspond to turnover frequencies of similar to 168 and similar to 42 s(-1), respectively, which are in that order 14 and 21 times higher compared to those of commercially available Pt/C benchmarks. The strong chemical and mechanical interactions between Pt and the octapod surface, along with pod-aided adhesion of the Pt/octapod network to the buckypaper, result in a long-term durability (>20 h) of the HER activity in both media. These results experimentally prove that the exploitation of our network of branched nanocrystals hosting Pt particles can circumvent the durability issues of the catalysts while adopting either ultralow Pt loadings or benchmarking carbon-supported Pt nanocrystals. Our work opens up prospects for using porous networks made with branched nanocrystals as catalysts with an ultralow amount of noble metals and controlled catalytic properties.									19	0	0	0	1	0	19			0897-4756	1520-5002		WOS:000526391300022		
J	LAVERGNE, J; LECI, E								PROPERTIES OF INACTIVE PHOTOSYSTEM-II CENTERS								PHOTOSYNTHESIS RESEARCH				35	3			323	343		10.1007/BF00016563				MAR 1993	1993	A fraction (usually in the range of 10-25%) of PS II centers is unable to transfer electrons from the primary quinone acceptor Q(A) to the secondary acceptor Q(B). These centers are inactive with respect to O2 evolution since their reopening after photochemical charge separation to the S2OA- state involves predominantly a back reaction to S1QA in the few seconds time range (slower phases are also occurring). Several properties of these centers are analyzed by fluorescence and absorption change experiments. The initial rise phase F(o)-F(pl) of fluorescence induction under weak illumination reflects both the closure of inactive centers and the modulation of the fluorescence yield by the S-states of the oxygen-evolving system: We estimate typical relative amplitudes of these contributions as, respectively, 65 and 35% of the F(o)-F(pl) amplitude. The half-rise time of this phase is significantly shorter than for the fluorescence induction in the presence of DCMU (in which all centers are involved). This finding is shown to be consistent with inactive centers sharing the same light-harvesting antenna as normal centers, a view which is also supported by comparing the dependence of the fluorescence yield on the amount of closed active or inactive centers estimated through absorption changes. It is argued that the exponential kinetics of the F(o)-F(pl) phase does not indicate absence of excitation energy transfer between the antennas of inactive and active centers. We show that the acceptor dichlorobenzoquinone does not restore electron transfer in inactive centers, in disagreement with previous suggestions. We confirm, however, the enhancement of steady-state electron flow caused by this quinone and suggest that it acts by relieving a blocking step involved in the reoxidation of a fraction of the plastoquinone pool. Part of the discrepancies between the present results and those from previous literature may arise from the confusion of inactive centers characterized on a single turnover basis and PS II centers that become blocked under steady-state conditions because of deficient reoxidation of their secondary acceptors.									122	0	0	0	117	0	123			0166-8595			WOS:A1993KR42800013	24318762

The 2DRR method can leverage electronic resonance enhancement to selectively probe chromophores embedded in complex environments (e.g., a cofactor in a protein). In addition, correlations between the two dimensions of the 2DRR spectrum reveal information that is not available in traditional Raman techniques. For example, distributions of reactant and product geometries can be correlated in systems that undergo chemical reactions on the femtosecond time scale. Structural heterogeneity in an ensemble may also be reflected in the 2D spectroscopic line shapes of both reactive and non-reactive systems. In this perspective article, these capabilities of 2DRR spectroscopy are discussed in the context of recent applications to the photodissociation reactions of triiodide and myoglobin. We also address key differences between the signal generation mechanisms for 2DRR and off-resonant 2D Raman spectroscopies. Most notably, it has been shown that these two techniques are subject to a tradeoff between sensitivity to anharmonicity and susceptibility to artifacts. Overall, recent experimental developments and applications of the 2DRR method suggest great potential for the future of the technique.

While PC ceramics have been extensively investigated as electrolytes for PC-SOECs/FCs, the development of corresponding singlephase electrode components has been hindered by difficulties in finding efficient mixed proton-electron conductors (MPECs), with also effective catalytic activity toward oxygen reduction and evolution reactions (ORR/OER). To address this challenge, we applied first-principles methods (PBE+U) to design new perovskite-oxide MPEC electrodes based on the known BaZrO3 PC ceramic. Our strategy has been to modify the parent material by substituting Zr with earth abundant transition metals, namely Mn and Fe. We found Zr : Mn and Zr : Fe ratios of 0.75 : 0.25 to be sufficient to obtain electronic structural features that can enable electric conductivity. We also investigated other relevant processes for MPEC-based electrodes: hydration, proton migration, and ORR/OER electrocatalysis. From calculations of key descriptors associated with these processes, we found that Zr substitution with Mn or Fe delivers in both cases promising PC-SOEC/FC electrodes. Moreover, our first-principles results highlight the specific qualities of Mn and Fe: the first provides better electronic features and electrocatalytic activities, whereas the latter allows for better hydration and proton migration. In perspective, our findings present clear indications for the experimental implementation and test of new low-cost materials for solid-oxide electrochemical cells.									32	1	0	0	0	0	32			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000403228200041

However, the state-of-the-art C-H/C-D exchange using noble metal catalysts or strong bases/acids suffers from poor functional group tolerances, poor selectivity and lack of scope for generating molecular complexity. Herein, we demonstrate the deuteration of halides using heavy water as the deuteration reagent and porous CdSe nanosheets as the catalyst. The deuteration mechanism involves the generation of highly active carbon and deuterium radicals via photoinduced electron transfer from CdSe to the substrates, followed by tandem radicals coupling process, which is mechanistically distinct from the traditional methods involving deuterium cations or anions. Our deuteration strategy shows better selectivity and functional group tolerances than current C-H/C-D exchange methods. Extending the synthetic scope, deuterated boronic acids, halides, alkynes, and aldehydes can be used as synthons in Suzuki coupling, Click reaction, C-H bond insertion reaction etc. for the synthesis of complex deuterated molecules.									96	10	0	0	23	0	96				2041-1723		WOS:000419446600008	29311606

To this end, methods and measurements, reproducibility in measurements, relationship between rates of dissolution of nitrogen and oxygen, etc. have been analysed and discussed. Embodying measured soluble and total (= soluble + insoluble) aluminium content of LCAK (low carbon aluminium killed) steel in a material balance frame work, a formalism has been developed to quantify metallurgical performance of steelmaking tundish systems. Two dimensionless tundish process performance parameters namely, generation index, G(I) and floatation index, F-I have been derived and represented as:G(I) = -Delta wt%Al-sol/(wt%Al-insol,Al-VD + [-Delta wt%Al-sol]FI = -Delta wt%Al-sol - Delta wt%Al-insol/(wt%Al-insol,Al-VD (+) [-Delta wt%Al-sol]in which, Delta represents composition differential between tundish exit and entry, respectively. To demonstrate the present work, operating data from six different domestic steels plants, including integrated and special steel mills, have been applied. It is shown, that while floatation of inclusions from tundishes is barely satisfactory, aluminium fading due to re-oxidation, and consequent generation of inclusions, are significant. In addition to such, on the basis of relevant theory and measurements, nitrogen and oxygen absorption from air during ladle to tundish transfer have been investigated at length and possible routes of dissolved aluminium re-oxidation in tundish have been examined further. It is shown that chemical reactions between slag and/or gunning material (viz., SiO2) and dissolved aluminium, rather than air ingression through shrouds, dominate [Al] re-oxidation in the tundish systems. The formalism developed in this study can also be conveniently extended to investigate equivalent phenomena in calcium treated LCAK steels, containing magnesium.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			0972-2815	0975-1645		WOS:000584969800001

PCC 6803								BIOCHEMISTRY				37	6			1523	1531		10.1021/bi9723818				FEB 10 1998	1998	Regions in the large lumenally exposed region (loop E) of CP47 affect properties of the water-splitting system in photosystem II (PS II). To investigate the role of these regions, we developed a method for functional complementation of obligate photoheterotrophic mutants carrying a deletion in one such region. Using an obligate photoheterotrophic mutant that carries a short deletion (Delta(D440-P447)) in loop E of CP47, completely degenerate sequences of eight codons in length were introduced at the site of the deletion. Transformants that were complemented to photoautotrophic growth were selected, and 20 such mutants were studied. Sequence analysis revealed that, as expected, in each of them CP47 had been restored to its wild-type length. However, none of the amino acid residues in the deleted region were found to be critical for function. A negatively chars ed residue at position 440 and a positively charged one at position 444 were favored but not required. Photoautotrophic growth of mutants obtained varied from almost normal to significantly impaired. The mutants contained 20-100% of the amount of PS II present in the wild type, with PS II amounts correlating with the initial rates of oxygen evolution. The mutants had a high rate of photoinactivation, and many mutants showed an up to 1000-fold increase in chloride requirement for photoautotrophic growth. These phenotypic effects were a direct consequence of the CP47 mutations and were not caused by altered binding of one of the extrinsic proteins. No particular amino acid residues in positions 440-447 of CP47 were found to be indispensable for photoautotrophic growth, and many amino acid combinations in this region support PS II function. However, the mutagenized region is shown to interact with the oxygen-evolving site of PS II and appears to have a direct role in chloride binding.									26	0	0	0	22	0	26			0006-2960			WOS:000072130500008	9484222

The synthesis of these composites were carried out by using a combination of coprecipitation and hydro thermal route while varying the molar ratio of Ce(NO3)(3)center dot 6H(2)O with respect to MgAl-LDH at constant pH of 10.5. The structural, optical and morphological correlations of these materials were successfully investigated by various physico-chemical techniques. The result signifies tuned-in band gap energy of composites within the range of MgAl-LDH to pure CeO2 i.e. from 3.2 eV to 2.80 eV. Moreover, the role of these composite in visible light induced H-2 energy production was well discussed. Among these composites, CeO2(5%)/MgAl-LDH showed a H-2 evolution rate of 990.0 mu mol 2 h(-1) under visible light irradiation and was enhanced by ca. 1.98 times than pure CeO2. The HRTEM image demonstrates the formation of hexagonal plates of MgAl-LDH uniformly distributed with the nanorods of CeO2. The existence of nanorods of CeO2 decreases the charge recombination rate and makes an easy transfer of effective surface charge to the surface of the MgAl-LDH, which facilitates the production of clean H-2. The significant quenching of PL peak and enhancement of photocurrent responses in photocurrent measurement of CeO2(x%)/MgAl-LDH composites reveals the better separation of electron and hole pairs. Furthermore, a detailed mechanism for the enhanced photocatalytic activity and the synergistic effect played by both MgAl-LDH and CeO2 were also discussed. (C) 2016 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC.

The electrochemical activities of the modified electrode were investigated and compared with those of Ce-PbO2, Nd-PbO2, and pure PbO2 electrodes. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) were used to characterize the surface morphology, crystal structure, and elemental states of the modified electrode. The Ce and Nd co-doped PbO2 electrode had smaller crystal particles, more compact structure, and higher activity of electrocatalysis compared with the single-doped and undoped PbO2 electrodes. Linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) were also utilized to study the electrochemical response of the modified electrodes. The results show that the prepared Ce-Nd-PbO2 electrode has the highest O-2 evolution potential (OEP) and lowest charge transfer resistance, suggesting that it has the lower energy consumption than the other three kinds of electrodes. Electrochemical oxidation methyl orange (MO) as a model dye wastewater was studied to evaluate the potential applications of this modified electrode in environmental science. It was found that the Ce-Nd-PbO2 electrode exhibited higher MO and chemical oxygen demand (COD) removal efficiency than single-doped and pure PbO2 electrodes.									6	0	0	0	1	0	6			1432-8488	1433-0768		WOS:000518510100006

Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) revealed a compact morphology for the as-deposited films and the formation of nanorodlike features on the surfaces after annealing at 600 degrees C. X-ray-photoelectron-spectroscopy analysis showed that the surface oxidation state is close to +III (as in Mn2O3) for the as-deposited films and increases slightly to a mixture of III and IV after annealing occurs in dry air at 400-600 degrees C. Glancing-incidence X-ray diffraction (GIXRD) suggested that the CaMnxOy films are amorphous even when heated to 600 degrees C. However, transmission electron microscopy (TEM) showed that there is actually a polycrystalline component of the film, which best matches Mn3O4 (hausmannite with the average Mn oxidation state of similar to+2.7) but may have a slightly expanded unit cell because of the incorporation of Ca. Electrochemical analyses revealed that the as-deposited CaMnxOy films were OER-inactive. In contrast, annealing at 400 or 600 degrees C resulted in an increase of similar to 15-fold in the current densities, which reached j congruent to 1.5 mA.cm(-2) at OER overpotentials of eta congruent to 550 mV in cyclic voltammetry (CV) sweeps. For the same eta, annealed CaMnxOy electrodes also showed good electrochemical stabilities during 2 h of electrolysis, as rather constant steady-state current densities of j congruent to 0.4-0.5 mA.cm(-2) were observed. The thicknesses and surface morphologies of the CaMnxOy films did not change during the electrochemical measurements, indicating that corrosion was negligible. In comparison with a previous study in which Ca-free thin layers of MnOx were evaluated, the results demonstrate that Ca2+ incorporation can enhance the OER activity of MnOx electrocatalysts prepared by sputter deposition. This work provides guidance for designing new electrodes for water oxidation on the basis of the abundant and nontoxic elements manganese and calcium.									17	1	0	0	0	0	17			0020-1669	1520-510X		WOS:000422810900031	29283573

The plasma created by surface flashover of the velvet cathode provides a zero work function emitter used to produce the space-charge-limited electron beam. In order to optimize the design of diodes and to better understand the plasma dynamics, we have developed a 0D Collisional-Radiative Model (CRM) which describes the time-dependent evolution of the density of the plasma species in three plasma compositions: 100% H, 95% H + 5% C, and 64% H + 31% O + 5% C. The non-equilibrium electron energy distribution functions (EEDFs) are pre-calculated for a large range of electron mean energies for each mixture. EEDFs and cross sections of electron impact processes are then used to tabulate the electron rate coefficients needed to simulate the time-dependent plasma species densities. The evolution of the electron mean energy is estimated through the electron beam current density itself inferred from particle-in-cell calculations experimentally validated. Visible emission spectroscopy measurements were performed in order to investigate the plasma composition, to measure the H-alpha/H-beta intensity ratio, and to estimate the electron density. It was shown that the electron density in our setup is between 10(14) and 10(16) cm(-3). Experimental results were compared to the 0D CRM. Results from the time-dependent CRM show that for the three studied plasma compositions, maximum electron densities range from 0.9 x 10(14) cm(-3) to 1.7 x 10(14) cm(-3) and that the electron energy averaged over the time interval of the electronic beam pulse is about 3.5 eV. An estimate of the electron energy inside the plasma during the relaxation provides values ranging from 0.10 eV to 0.12 eV based on comparison between the calculated and measured H-alpha/H-beta intensity ratio averaged over 5 mu s. Moreover, main reactions involved in the evolution of the electron density were pointed out. Published by AIP Publishing.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			1070-664X	1089-7674		WOS:000443730900105

To further understand the interaction mechanisms of gas-liquid phase gliding arc degradation process for the wastewater treatment, the characteristics of major reactive species (the OH and NO radicals) in a gas-liquid gliding arc at atmospheric pressure have been investigated by using optical emission spectroscopy. The chemical reactions that may lead to the generation of free radicals in the discharge were discussed. The influence of operating conditions (water feed rate, input voltage etc.) on the relative intensity of radical emission was studied. The results show that axial evolution of the relative emission intensity of both reactive species exhibit the similar tendency under the same operating conditions. In non-thermodynamic equilibrium region of the arc discharge, the intensities of both radicals increase with the input voltage. In addition, the intensity of OH radical increases with the water feed rate, while the opposition phenomena are observed for NO radical.									4	8	0	0	0	0	10			1000-0593			WOS:000258968500037	18975818

To produce H-2 with a high efficiency, the key issues that need to be solved are the relatively low photovoltage of the Si-based photoelectrode and the sluggish kinetics of the H-2 generation reaction occurring on the surface of Si. In this study, we designed and fabricated the Ptx(x=2,3)Si/PtSi/p-Si photocathode for high-efficiency H-2 generation via PEC. The theoretically lower PtSi/p-Si junction Schottky barrier height was elevated to a high value of 0.9 eV by dopant segregation, thereby obtaining a high photovoltage. Upon the electrochemical surface reconstruction of PtSi, a thin layer of Ptx(x=2,3)Si with a high catalytic activity is in situ formed on the photocathode which significantly enhances the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) kinetics. Accordingly, a favorable onset potential for HER of 0.54 V vs. RHE and a high saturated photocurrent density of 30 mA cm(-2) at 0 V vs. RHE are achieved from the Ptx(x=2,3)Si/PtSi/p-Si photocathode. The applied-bias photo-to-current efficiency (ABPE) of the Ptx(x=2,3)Si/PtSi/p-Si photocathode reaches a maximum at 5.8%, which is record-high for the Si-based single junction photocathodes without a buried p-n junction. Moreover, the Ptx(x=2,3)Si/PtSi/p-Si photocathode exhibits an excellent stability in the long-term PEC H-2 generation test. This work provides a new perception onto the design and construction of Si-based photocathodes with improved catalytic activity, as well as the possibility of efficient and stable PEC H-2 generation.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000753964900001

The results of photocatalytic hydrogen evolution and apparent quantum efficiency show that ZGP is a promising photocatalyst for hydrogen production both under visible and near-infrared light irradiation. In addition, it is also found that adding the common stabilizer H3PO2 and ultrasonic treatment can efficiently improve the photocatalytic activity and stability of ZGP.									6	1	0	0	0	0	6			2095-0462	2095-0470		WOS:000523152700001

Due to their unique physicochemical, optical and electrical properties, a wide variety of g-C3N4-based photocatalysts have been designed to drive various reduction and oxidation reactions under light irradiation with suitable wavelengths. In this review, we have systematically summarized the photocatalytic fundamentals of g-C3N4-based photocatalysts, including fundamental mechanism of heterogeneous photocatalysis, advantages, challenges and the design considerations of g-C3N4-based photocatalysts. The versatile properties of g-C3N4-based photocatalysts are highlighted, including their crystal structural, surface phisicochemical, stability, optical, adsorption, electrochemical, photoelectrochemical and electronic properties. Various design strategies are also thoroughly reviewed, including band-gap engineering, defect control, dimensionality tuning, pore texture tailoring, surface sensitization, heterojunction construction, co-catalyst and nanocarbon loading. Many important applications are also addressed, such as photocatalytic water splitting (H-2 evolution and overall water splitting), degradation of pollutants, carbon dioxide reduction, selective organic transformations and disinfection. Through reviewing the important state-of-the-art advances on this topic, it may provide new opportunities for designing and constructing highly effective g-C(3)N(4-)based photocatalysts for various applications in photocatalysis and other related fields, such as solar cell, photoelectrocatalysis, electrocatalysis, lithium battery, supercapacitor, fuel cell and separation and purification.

A partial 5' terminal sequence with 509 nucleotides complementary to cab (chlorophyll alb binding protein) genes reduced the amount of transcript to almost undectectable levels. We demonstrated for endogenous genes that a 5' terminal sequence with only 52 to 105 nucleotides complementary to the transit sequence of cab can be equally efficient in gene repression. Chlorophyll content and chlorophyll a-to-chlorophyll b ratios of thylakoid membranes isolated from transgenic plants were unchanged in comparison with the wild type. Photosynthetic oxygen evolution and in vivo-measured chlorophyll fluorescence of the transformants showed that LHCII accumulates to normal levels. The reduced level of cab mRNA did not correlate with the amount of LHCII in thylakoids. This indicates that transcriptional regulation is not the rate-limiting step in the biogenesis of the LHCII apoprotein. The antenna sire of photosystem II is therefore modulated by yet undiscovered posttranscriptional mechanisms.									60	0	0	0	57	0	62			1040-4651			WOS:A1995QJ99300003	7756826

Tin diselenide (SnSe2) is the one who also received substantial consideration in many fields due to low cost, earth-abundant and environment-friendly. However, the great challenge to make heterojunction with other semiconductor material to improve its efficiency for photocatalytic water splitting. For this purpose, we have prepared a 1D nanofiber of TiO2 by electrospinning and produced a needle-like structure on the fiber by following the alkali hydrothermal method. The chemical vapor deposition method (CVD) was adopted, first to load g-C3N4 QDs then nanoflakes of SnSe2 on the branched fiber of TiO2 and make a strong heterojunction. The composite interpreted excellent photocatalytic performance by producing hydrogen about 2375 mu mol. g(-1).h(-1) having a quantum efficiency of HER more than 16 % at 420 nm. The photoluminescence, time decay fluorescent spectra and photoelectrochemical results ratified that SnSe2 not only reduces the charge recombination by increasing the transfer of electron but also provides an active site for hydrogen production as a cocatalyst. This study presents an inexpensive and environmentally friendly cocatalyst for hydrogen production as a substitution of noble metals.									63	4	0	0	7	0	64			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000526110500052

Herein, we report a synthetic strategy to prepare freestanding hierarchically structured, nitrogen-doped nanoporous graphitic carbon membranes functionalized with Janus-type Co/CoP nano crystals (termed as HNDCM-Co/CoP), which were successfully applied as a highly efficient, binder-free electrode in the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Benefited from multiple structural merits, such as a high degree of graphitization, three-dimensionally interconnected micro/meso/macropores, uniform nitrogen doping, well-dispersed Co/CoP nanocrystals, as well as the confinement effect of the thin carbon layer on the nanocrystals, HNDCM-Co/CoP exhibited superior electrocatalytic activity and long-term operation stability for HER under both acidic and alkaline conditions. As a proof-of-concept of practical usage, a 5.6 cm x 4 cm x 60 FM macroscopic piece of HNDCM-Co/CoP was prepared in our laboratory. Driven by a solar cell, electroreduction of water in alkaline conditions (pH 14) was performed, and H-2 was produced at a rate of 16 mL/min, demonstrating its potential as real-life energy conversion systems.									160	10	0	0	6	0	163			1936-0851	1936-086X		WOS:000400233200098	28362485

For electrochemical characterization at lab-scale, a cell in the shape of T-connector ("T-cell") is usually used, offering connections to working, counter and reference electrode. To maintain comparability to this established system, an in operando X-shaped cell, i.e., a T-cell ("X-cell"), which varies only by an additional connector from the original setup, was designed. The new OEMS cell based on DEMS cell designs was linked to a modified GC-MS System and a potentiostat for in operando analysis of the evolving gases and the voltammetry experiments, respectively. This work comprises the evaluation of this new OEMS method in potentiostatic aging experiments of the conventional electrolyte 1M LiPF6 in EC:EMC (1:1, by wt) in LiNi1/3Co1/3Mn1/3O2 (NCM)/Li half cells as a function of the applied cut-off potential. Mainly CO2 release at onset potentials > 4.6 V vs. Li/Li+ could be identified. At a potential of > 5.4V vs. Li/Li+, the evolution of silicon tetrafluoride (SiF4) was observed mainly stemming from the HE induced degradation of the used glass fiber separator. Furthermore, triethyl phosphate (TEP) evolved from the LiPF6 decomposition at > 5.5 V vs. Li/Li+. Oxygen evolution either coming from the oxidative decomposition of the electrolyte or degradation of the NCM cathode material was not detected at even 5.5 V vs. Li/Li+ and at 20 degrees C.

However, the origin of this selectivity and the influence of catalyst precursors on it are not fully understood. We combine operando X-ray diffraction and operando Raman spectroscopy to monitor the structural and compositional evolution of three Cu precursors during the CO2RR. The results indicate that despite different kinetics, all three precursors are completely reduced to Cu(O) with similar grain sizes (similar to 11 nm), and that oxidized Cu species are not involved in the CO2RR. Furthermore, Cu(OH)(2)- and Cu-2(OH)(2)CO3-derived Cu exhibit considerable tensile strain (0.43%similar to 0.55%), whereas CuO-derived Cu does not. Theoretical calculations suggest that the tensile strain in Cu lattice is conducive to promoting CO2RR, which is consistent with experimental observations. The high CO2RR performance of some derived Cu catalysts is attributed to the combined effect of the small grain size and lattice strain, both originating from the in situ electroreduction of precursors. These findings establish correlations between Cu precursors, lattice strains, and catalytic behaviors, demonstrating the unique ability of operando characterization in studying electrochemical processes.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1				2041-1723		WOS:000842231900008	35982055

However, the catalytic properties of ruthenium dimers have not yet been explored for visible light-driven water oxidation. Herein, the photocatalytic performance of a dipyridyl propane-bridged ruthenium dimer 2 was investigated in comparison with its monomeric precursor, [Ru(bda)(pic)z] (1), in CH3CN/phosphate buffer mixed solvent in a three -component system including a photosensitizer and a sacrificial electron acceptor. Experimental results showed that the activity of each catalyst was strongly dependent on the content of CH3CN in the phosphate buffer, which not only affected the driving force for water oxidation, but also altered the kinetics of the reaction, probably through different mechanisms associated with the O-O bond formation. As a result, dimer 2 showed significantly higher activity than monomer 1 in the solvent containing a low content of CH3CN, and comparable activities were attained with a high content of CH3CN in the solvent. Under the optimal conditions, complex 2 achieved a turnover number of 638 for photocatalytic O-2 evolution. (C) 2018, Dalian Institute of Chemical Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences.

Electrochemical experiments are carried out in a three-electrode half-cell at room temperature. The first part of this paper focuses on the characterization of PEDOT and PEDOT-PSS as a diffusion layer material. PEDOT/C cyclic voltammograms are recorded in 1 M H2SO4 in the range between the hydrogen evolution and polymer over-oxidation potentials. The incorporation of the PSS counter-ion into the polymer matrix leads to higher impedance values compared to PEDOT without PSS. The second part deals with the study of PEDOT as a Pt catalyst support. It is found that the partial over-oxidation of PEDOT enhances the activity of Pt for methanol oxidation. This can be explained by a change in the morphology of PEDOT that probably improves methanol diffusion within the reaction layer. The degradation of the conducting polymer is confirmed by SEM, EDX, and FTIR measurements.					3rd Sino-German Workshop on Fuel Cells3rd Sino-German Workshop on Fuel Cells	MAY 02-04, 2005MAY 02-04, 2005	Inst Fuel Cell, Fuel Cell R&D Ctr; Shanghai JiaoTong UnivInst Fuel Cell, Fuel Cell R&D Ctr; Shanghai JiaoTong Univ	Shanghai, PEOPLES R CHINAShanghai, PEOPLES R CHINA	32	1	0	0	0	0	33			1615-6846			WOS:000243332900004		
J	Iwatsuki, T; Yoshida, H								Groundwater chemistry and fracture mineralogy in the basement granitic rock in the Tono uranium mine area, Gifu Prefecture, Japan - Groundwater composition, Eh evolution analysis by fracture filling minerals								GEOCHEMICAL JOURNAL				33	1			19	32		10.2343/geochemj.33.19				1999	1999	The mineralogy of fracture system and the chemistry of groundwater have been studied in deep boreholes drilled in granitic rock to understand the chemical evolution of groundwater and redox conditions within the deep underground which preserved the Tone uranium deposit. Geological studies revealed that fracture system within the granitic rock can be classified into intact zones, moderately fractured zones and intensely fractured zones, using the degree of fracturing. Fracture fillings within the fractured zones consist mainly of clay minerals such as montmorillonite. Hydrogen and oxygen isotopic data show that young, shallow groundwater has been traveled into a depth of at least approximately 186 m. The precipitation of iron hydroxide provides an evidence to support the idea that the oxidizing surface water has traveled down to a depth of approximately 130 m from the surface. Groundwater is rich in Na+, Ca2+ and HCO3- near the surface and rich in Na+ and HCO3- in depth. Mineral saturation indices suggest that the dissolution of plagioclase and calcite is more significant in the shallower part than in the deeper part of the groundwater system. Na+ concentration of the groundwaters increases with depth and Ca2+, Mg2+ concentrations decrease at a depth of 200 m and over. Below this depth, the increase in Na+ concentrations is nearly equivalent to the decrease in combined Ca2+ and Mg2+ concentrations, suggesting that a Na-(Ca2+, Mg2+) ion exchange reaction occurs between the montmorillonite and groundwater. The chemical evolution of groundwater in the granitic rock is controlled mainly by the dissolution of plagioclase and calcite, and by the ion exchange reaction between montmorillonite in the fractured zones and groundwater. In-situ Eh-value of groundwater in the fractured zones is approximately 0 mV at a depth of approximately 180 m. This value is on the boundary between the Fe(OH)(3), and Fe2+ stability field on the Eh-pH diagram for the Fe-S-H-O system. The redox conditions of deep groundwaters in the fracture system are probably controlled by Fe2+ and Fe3+ in the granitic rocks. On the other hand, the amount of pyrite in the granite is limited. Pyrite crystals that maintain their original form are observed in the intact zones, whereas the pyrite with dissolution texture is found in the fractured zones. This can be explained that the minerals in the fractured zones have reacted with oxidized groundwater over a long period of time. There is a possibility that the redox condition of groundwater is controlled by aqueous reduced sulfur species and pyrite, and that the Eh value of groundwaters may be around -300 mV.									60	2	0	0	21	0	61			0016-7002	1880-5973		WOS:000079253100003

Infaunal benthic organisms are associated with different redox fronts as micro-habitats and must be affected by such changes during natural hypoxia events. In order to document the geochemical evolution of the sediment during prolonged anoxia in the framework of an in situ experiment designed to mimic natural conditions, benthic chambers were deployed on the seafloor of the Northern Adriatic and sampled after 9, 30 and 315 days of incubation. Oxygen and sulfide were measured continuously in the early stages (9 days) of the experiment. High-resolution pore water profiles were sampled by DET probes and redox-sensitive species (S(VI), Mn(II) and Fe(II)) and alkalinity were measured.Starting oxygen saturation was about 80% within the chamber. After 7 days, anoxia was established in the bottom waters within the chambers. Mn(II) and Fe(II) started diffusing towards the anoxic water column until they reached the surficial sediment. Being reoxidized there, Mn and Fe re-precipitated, giving a rusty coloration to the seafloor. Infaunal species appeared at the sediment surface. After 20 days, all macro-organisms were dead. Decomposition of macroorganisms at the sediment-water interface generated S(-II) within the entire height of the chamber, leading to a downward flux of sulfides into the sediment, where they were quickly oxidized by metallic oxides or precipitated as FeS. S(-II) was below detection in the water column and pore waters at the end of the experiment. Our results suggest that S(II) enrichment in the water column of coastal systems, which are episodically anoxic, is strongly controlled by the biomass of benthic macrofauna and its decay during anoxia, whereas its residence time in the water column is controlled by iron availability (as solid oxides or as dissolved reduced cations) within the sediment, even without water circulation.									15	0	0	0	10	0	15			1726-4170	1726-4189		WOS:000335374200007

However, the high lithium salt concentration electrolytes of ALIBs result in their high cost and deteriorate kinetic performance. Therefore, it is challenging for ALIBs to explore aqueous electrolytes with appropriate concentration to balance the electrochemical window and kinetic performance as well as the cost. In contrast to maintaining high concentrations of aqueous electrolytes (>20 m), a small number of hydrophobic cations are introduced to a much lower electrolyte concentration (13.8 m), and it is found that, compared with WIS electrolytes, ALIBs with these concentration-lowered electrolytes possess a compatible stable electrochemical window (3.23 V) and achieve better kinetic performance. These findings originate from the added cations, which form an electric-field-reinforced hydrophobic cationic sieve (HCS) that blocks water away from the anode and suppresses the hydrogen evolution reaction. Meanwhile, the lower electrolyte concentration provides significant benefits to ALIBs, including lower cost, better rate capability (lower viscosity of 18 cP and higher ionic conductivity of 22 mS cm(-1) at 25 degrees C), and improved low-temperature performance (liquidus temperature of -10.18 degrees C).									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0935-9648	1521-4095		WOS:000867382800001	36121604

Tin diselenide (SnSe2) is the one who also received substantial consideration in many fields due to low cost, earth-abundant and environment-friendly. However, the great challenge to make heterojunction with other semiconductor material to improve its efficiency for photocatalytic water splitting. For this purpose, we have prepared a 1D nanofiber of TiO2 by electrospinning and produced a needle-like structure on the fiber by following the alkali hydrothermal method. The chemical vapor deposition method (CVD) was adopted to load nanoflakes of SnSe2 on the branched fiber of TiO2 and make a strong heterojunction. The composite interpreted excellent photocatalytic performance by producing hydrogen about 0.95 mmol g(-1) h(-1) in comparison with branched TiO2 (0.47 mmol g(-1) h(-1)) and conventional TiO2 fiber (0.35 mmol g(-1) h(-1)). The photoluminescence, time decay fluorescent spectra and photoelectrochemical results ratified that SnSe2 not only reduces the charge recombination by increasing the transfer of electron but also provides the active site for hydrogen production as a cocatalyst. This study presents an inexpensive and environmentally friendly photocatalyst for hydrogen production without the use of noble metals.									5	0	0	0	1	0	5			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000545298400010

Our modelling and computer simulation results show that, in the case of a brain tumour, oxygen distribution in the tumour volume may be sufficiently described by a time-independent steady-state equation without losing the characteristics of a time-dependent diffusion equation. This makes the solution of oxygen concentration in the tumour volume computationally more efficient, thus enabling simulation of tumour growth on a large scale. We solve this steady-state equation using a central difference method. We take into account the composition of cells and intercellular adhesion in addition to processes involved in cell cycleproliferation, quiescence, apoptosis, and necrosisin the tumour model. More importantly, we consider cell mutation that gives rise to different phenotypes and therefore a tumour with heterogeneous population of cells. A new phenotype is probabilistically chosen and has the ability to survive at lower levels of nutrient concentration and reproduce faster. We show that heterogeneity of cells that compose a tumour leads to its irregular growth and that avascular growth is not supported for tumours of diameter above 18mm. We compare results from our growth simulation with existing experimental data on Ehrlich ascites carcinoma and tumour spheroid cultures and show that our results are in good agreement with the experimental findings.

J	Meakin, Casey A.; Arnett, David								Turbulent convection in stellar interiors. I. Hydrodynamic simulation								ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL				667	1			448	475		10.1086/520318				SEP 20 2007	2007	We describe the results of 3D numerical simulations of oxygen shell burning and hydrogen core burning in a 23 M-circle dot stellar model. A detailed comparison is made to stellar mixing-length theory (MLT) for the shell-burning model. Simulations in 2D are significantly different from 3D, in terms of both flow morphology and velocity amplitude. Convective mixing regions are better predicted using a dynamic boundary condition based on the bulk Richardson number than by purely local, static criteria like Schwarzschild or Ledoux. MLT gives a good description of the velocity scale and temperature gradient for shell convection; however, there are other important effects that it does not capture, mostly related to the dynamical motion of the boundaries between convective and nonconvective regions. There is asymmetry between upflows and downflows, so the net kinetic energy flux is not zero. The motion of convective boundaries is a source of gravity waves; this is a necessary consequence of the deceleration of convective plumes. Convective "overshooting'' is best described as an elastic response by the convective boundary, rather than ballistic penetration of the stable layers by turbulent eddies. The convective boundaries are rife with internal and interfacial wave motions, and a variety of instabilities arise that induce mixing through a process best described as turbulent entrainment. We find that the rate at which material entrainment proceeds at the boundaries is consistent with analogous laboratory experiments and simulation and observation of terrestrial atmospheric mixing. In particular, the normalized entrainment rate E = u(E)/sigma H is well described by a power-law dependence on the bulk Richardson number Ri(B) Delta bL/sigma(2)(H) for the conditions studied, 20 less than or similar to Ri(B) less than or similar to 420. We find E = ARi(B)(-n), with best-fit values log A = 0.027 +/- 0: 38 and n = 1.05 +/- 0.21. We discuss the applicability of these results to stellar evolution calculations.									266	0	0	0	2	0	266			0004-637X	1538-4357		WOS:000249455900040

Here, a new strategy for the in situ growth of large numbers of 2D heterostructures on the centimeter-scale substrate is developed. In the method, large numbers of 2D MoS2, MoO2, or their heterostructures of MoO2/MoS2 are controllably grown in the same setup by simply tuning the gap distance between metal precursor and growth substrate, which changes the concentration of metal precursors feed. A lateral force microscope is used first to identify the locations of each material in the heterostructures, which have MoO2 on the top of MoS2. Noteworthy, the creation of a clean interface between atomic thin MoO2 (metallic) and MoS2 (semiconducting) results in a different electronic structure compared with pure MoO2 and MoS2. Theoretical calculations show that the charge redistribution at such an interface results in an improved HER performance on the MoO2/MoS2 heterostructures, showing an overpotential of 60 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) and a Tafel slope of 47 mV dec(-1). This work reports a new strategy for the in situ growth of heterostructures on large-scale substrates and provides platforms to exploit their applications.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1613-6810	1613-6829		WOS:000826044200001	35841344

The key obstacle in preparing SAs lies in the development of appropriate supports that can avoid aggregation or sintering during synthetic procedures. As such, achieving high loadings of isolated SAs is nontrivial and challenging. Conventional methods usually afford the formation of SAs with extremely low loadings (less than 1.5 wt%). In this work, a new in situ preparation strategy that enables the synthesis of isolated cobalt (Co) SAs with an exceptionally high metal loading, up to 5.9 wt%, is developed. The approach is based on a simple one-step pyrolysis of a nitrogen-enriched molecular carbon precursor (1,4,5,8,9,12-hexaazatriphenylene hexacarbonitrile) and CoCl2. Furthermore, due to the successful electron transfer from carbon nitride to the isolated Co SAs, we demonstrate a high-performance photocatalytic H-2 production using Co SAs as a co-catalyst, and the evolution rate is measured to be 1180 mu mol g(-1) h(-1). We anticipate that this new study will inspire the discovery of more isolated SACs with high metal loadings, evidently advancing the development of this emerging type of advanced catalysts.									34	5	0	0	2	0	34			2041-6520	2041-6539		WOS:000459929800035	30996973

The thermal springs, characterized by high total dissolved solids (TDS) contents and predominance of NaCl, ascend from aquifers at 3-4 km depth and discharge at a temperature of 65-70 degrees C. The barite-(pyrite) mineralization is found in upflow and discharge zones of the present-day thermal springs as well as at elevations up to 50 m above the current water table. Hence, this mineralization style constitutes a continuous record of the hydrothermal activity, linking the past evolution with the present state of this geothermal system. The sulphur isotope signatures of the mineralization indicate a continuous decrease of the delta S-34 of sulphate from +16.9 parts per thousand. in the oldest barite to +10.1 parts per thousand. in the present-day thermal water. The delta S-34 values of barite closely resemble various recently active thermal springs along the southern margin of the Rhenish Massif and contrast strongly with different regional ground and mineral waters. The mineralogical and isotopic signatures, combined with calculations based on uplift rates and the regional geological history, indicate a minimum activity of the thermal spring system at Wiesbaden of about 500 000 years. This timeframe is considerably larger than conservative models, which estimate the duration of thermal spring systems in continental intraplate settings to last for several 10 000 years. The calculated equilibrium sulphur isotope temperatures of coexisting barite and pyrite range between 65 and 80 degrees C, close to the discharge temperature of the springs, which would indicate apparent equilibrium precipitation. Kinetic modelling of the re-equilibration of the sulphate-sulphicle pair during water ascent shows that this process would require 220 Myr. Therefore, we conclude that pyrite is formed from precursor Fe monosulphide phases, which rapidly precipitate in the near-surface environment, preserving the isotope fractionation between dissolved sulphate and sulphide established in the deep aquifer. Equilibrium modelling of water-mineral reactions shows slight supersaturation of barite at the discharge temperature. Pyrite is already strongly supersaturated at the temperatures estimated for the aquifer (110 degrees C) and processes in the near-surface environment are most probably related to contact of the thermal water with atmospheric oxygen, resulting in formation of oxidized intermediate sulphur species and precipitation of Fe monosulphide phases, which subsequently recrystallize to pyrite.									15	0	0	0	2	0	16			1468-8115	1468-8123		WOS:000229095000004

Protection efficiencies of almost 98% and 91% were obtained with 50 mM Tyr and Gly, respectively. On the other hand, Ala and Val reached only about 75%. Corrosion rates determined by the Tafel extrapolation method were in good agreement with those obtained by EFM and an independent chemical (i.e.. non-electrochemical) method. The chemical method of confirmation of the corrosion rates involved determination of the dissolved Cu2+, using ICP-AES (inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometry) method of chemical analysis. Nyquist plots exhibited a high frequency depressed semicircle followed by a straight line portion (Warburg diffusion tail) in the low-frequency region. The impedance data were interpreted according to two suitable equivalent circuits. The kinetics of dissolved O-2 reduction and hydrogen evolution reactions on copper surface were also studied in O-2-saturated 0.50 M H2SO4 solutions using polarization measurements combined with the rotating disc electrode (RDE). The Koutecky-Levich plot indicated that the dissolved O-2 reduction at the copper electrode was an apparent 4-electron process. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

In the present paper, a one-step condensation method is described for connecting anthraquinone units via thioether bonds to generate a poly(anthraquinone sulfide) (PAQS) material as a promising lithium energy-storage system. Poly(anthraquinone sulfide)/carbon nanotube (PAQS/CNT) frameworks are then prepared via an in-situ chemical solution method. The good electrochemical performance of the PAQS/CNT composite with 2 wt % carbon nanotubes is then demonstrated, with a significantly higher discharge specific capacity (187.2 mA h g(-1)) than that of a pure PAQS electrode (101.0 mA h g(-1)). Moreover, the specific capacity remains at 168.4 mA h g(-1) after 200 cycles, with a retention rate of 90.0 %. It is confirmed that CNTs play a number of roles in the composite polymer material, such as stabilizing the material structure during battery charging and discharging, improving the electronic conductivity, and alleviating the dissolution of the components of the organic electrolyte.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			2196-0216			WOS:000664219100018

Over a couple of decades, there have been intensive efforts to develop efficient artificial photosynthetic devices. Conventional studies have focused on the design and preparation of such devices using inorganic materials. However, these inorganic materials have many inherent problems, resulting in a low efficiency of solar-to-chemical energy conversion devices. These include a low absorption coefficient, severe surface recombination of charge carriers, low electrical conductivity, and poor catalytic activity. In this regard, porous framework materials such as metal organic frameworks (MOFs) and covalent organic frameworks (COFs) can be considered promising materials for solar-to-chemical energy conversion. Their porous, layered, and ordered structure can impart the following characteristics: (i) high absorption coefficients, (ii) efficient charge separation, (iii) long charge carrier lifetime, and (iv) facile access to reactants. Furthermore, their physicochemical properties can be tailored by varying the linker's chain length, introducing additional functional groups, and employing different symmetry combinations even with similar building blocks. As a result, there have recently been intensive studies on the application of MOFs and COFs for solar-to-chemical energy conversion. In this paper, we review recent efforts on their various solar-to-chemical energy conversion applications. In particular, we have organized recent studies on the basis of their function and target reactions in chronological order to help readers readily understand the progress in MOFs and COFs and challenges to their application in artificial photosynthesis. Last, we suggest the future research direction of growing MOF- and COF-based thin films for more efficient utilization of them.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			2052-1553			WOS:000670025500001

Herein, carbonate boosted solar water splitting in nickel-based plasmonic hybrid nanostructures is disclosed for the first time via in-situ experiments and density-functional theory (DFT)-based calculations. Ni@NiO/NiCO3 core@shell (shell consisting of crystalline NiO and amorphous NiCO3) nanostructure with varying size and compositions are studied for hydrogen production. The visible light absorption at ~470 nm excludes the possibility of NiO as an active photocatalyst, emphasizing plasmon driven H2 evolution. Under white light irradiation, higher hydrogen yield of ~80 mumol/g/h for vacuum annealed sample over pristine (~50 mumol/g/h) complements the spectroscopic data and DFT results, uncovering amorphous NiCO3 as an active site for H2 absorption due to its unique electronic structure. This conclusion also supports the time-resolved photoluminescence results, indicating that the plasmonic electrons originating from Ni are transferred to NiCO3 via NiO. The H2 evolution rate can further be enhanced and tuned by the incorporation of NiO between Ni and NiCO3. All rights reserved Elsevier.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			1872-9118			INSPEC:21911545

It exhibits superior bifunctional catalytic activity towards the OER (eta = 292 mV@10 mA cm(-2)) and ORR (E-1/2 = 0.811 V), with a Delta E as low as 0.711 V in 0.1 M KOH electrolyte, outperforming most of the ones previously reported in the literature. Through physical structure characterization, electrochemical properties and DFT calculation studies, the unique heterostructure and oxygen vacancies/defects that synergistically promote the catalytic process and greatly improve the catalytic performance were verified. Impressively, the as-assembled rechargeable ZAB based on DBD-NiFe/NiSe2@NCNT as an electrocatalyst obtains a remarkable maximum power density of 131.61 mW cm(-2) and an exceptional stability for 1000 cycles at 10 mA cm(-2). Furthermore, the DBD-NiFe/NiSe2@NCNT-based flexible all-solid-state ZAB revealed excellent performance with robust flexibility. This work provides worthy insights into the search for high-efficiency and low-cost energy storage and conversion devices.									6	0	0	0	1	0	6			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000781092500001

The linear kinetics composed of two stages is observed for each case, suggesting a chemical reaction determining process, and the second stage behaves a slightly higher oxidation rate. In air, the oxidation behavior exhibits an inhomogeneous oxidation due to the presence of macro-particles and impurity phases in the coating, while a transition from inhomogeneous oxidation to homogeneous oxidation occurs in pure steam. Compared to that in air, the oxidation process in pure steam is accelerated, leading to higher mass gains. XRD and EDX analyses indicate that Al easily diffuses to the surface and thus forms alpha-Al2O3 layer under the two atmospheres, which result from the high Al activity within MAX phase. Additionally, the scaling mechanism of Ti2AlN coatings is discussed in terms of the microstructure evolution.									7	1	0	0	0	0	8			0272-8842	1873-3956		WOS:000463688500148

In this study, we demonstrate that a rapid thermal pretreatment in nitrogen can effectively mitigate the exothermic behavior of PAN fibers, such as decreasing the initial temperature, broadening the exothermal peak, and decreasing the nominal heat release during heating the fibers in air. The color of fibers has shown gradual changes from white to light yellow, yellow and brown during thermal pretreatment in nitrogen with the increase of pretreating temperature and time. The differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), Fourier Transform Infrared Spectrometer (FTIR), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and Thermogravimetric Analysis (TG) characterization have been applied to analyze the thermal properties, chemical and physical structural difference between PAN, and thermally pretreated PAN fibers. The thermal pretreatment of PAN fibers in nitrogen could induce cyclization, dehydrogenation, and cross-linking reactions, in which the cyclization play an important role on improving the cyclization index of stabilized PAN fibers. Meanwhile, the pretreatment can result in noticeable changes of the aggregation structure of PAN fibers, as indicated by the increase of crystallinity and crystalline size. These structural modifications can benefit the main cyclization reaction during stabilization and enhance the carbon yield in resultant carbon fibers. The rapid thermal pretreatment in nitrogen could increase efficiency of modification on PAN fibers, and that could save much time and energy. It is beneficial to manufacture low-cost carbon fibers and to spread the applications of carbon fibers.									15	0	0	0	1	0	15				2073-4360		WOS:000519848300063	31906379

In 0.1 M HCl, CeP-rGO achieves a large NH3 yield of 28.69 mu g h(-1) mg(cat.)(-1) and a high faradaic efficiency of 9.6% at -0.40 V, and it also shows high electrochemical and structural stability.

LPE typically requires surfactants for aqueous dispersions or organic solvents with high boiling point. However, they have major drawbacks such as toxicity, aggregation during solvent evaporation or the presence of residues. Here, dispersions of molybdenum disulfide in acetone are prepared and show much higher concentration and stability than predicted by Hansen parameter analysis. Aiming to understand these enhanced properties, the nanosheets were characterised using UV-visible spectroscopy, zeta potential measurements, atomic force microscopy, Raman spectroscopy, transmission electron microscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and scanning transmission microscopy combined with spatially-resolved electron energy loss spectroscopy. Also, the performance of the MoS2 nanosheets exfoliated in acetone was compared to that of those exfoliated in isopropanol as a catalyst for the hydrogen evolution reaction. The conclusion from the chemical characterisation was that MoS2 nanosheets exfoliated in acetone have an oxygen edge functionalisation, in the form of molybdenum oxides, changing its interaction with solvents and explaining the observed high-quality and stability of the resulting dispersion in a low boiling point solvent. Exfoliation in acetone could potentially be applied as a pretreatment to modify the solubility of MoS2 by edge functionalisation.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000484345500010	31393511

Herein, we report the development of directed highly ordered nitrogen-rich honeycomb-like mesoporous carbon nitride nanosheets by using a novel synthetic approach for this purpose. The unique formation route, surface structure and charge carrier dynamics of the two dimensional holey nanosheets are comprehensively monitored and confirmed by SAXS, HRTEM, AFM, BET, XPS and TRPL analyses. Non-stoichiometric high nitrogen content mesoporous nanosheets with the final stoichiometry of g-C(3)N(4.5)acquiring a high specific surface area (382 m(2)g(-1)), remarkable pore size (7.2 nm) and sheet thickness similar to 5-6 nm are realized in this first report. This elegant material possesses unique low band-gap energy (2.42 eV). Remarkably, the as-synthesized g-C(3)N(4.5)NSs exhibit a record high photocatalytic H(2)evolution rate of 8180 mu mol g(-1)h(-1)under the present light irradiation (420 <=lambda <= 510 nm) condition. The apparent quantum efficiency is found to be as high as 27.14% at 420 nm and retains its photocatalytic activity for longer consecutive catalytic cycles. Bigger pore size and pore volume, and thin walls leading to shortening of the path length of exciton pairs, efficient charge separation and the prolonged average life time of the charge carriers, and lone electron pairs associated with the excess nitrogen content are found to be the reasons behind the excellent visible light driven water splitting reaction.									13	2	0	0	0	0	13			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000546391600041

The POM scaffolds feature slight conformational differences that influence the chemical behavior of 3 and 4 as demonstrated by their reaction with H2O. In the case of 3, the hydrolysis reaction of the isopropoxide ligand is only little shifted toward the formation of a monomeric [PW9O34((BuSiO)-Bu-t)(3)Ti(OH)](3-) (5) species [log K = -1.96], whereas 4 reacted readily with (HO)-O-2 to form a mu-oxo bridged dimer {[SbW9O33((BuSiO)-Bu-t)(3)Ti](2)O}(6-) (6). The more confined was the coordination site, the more hydrophobic was the metal complex. By studying the reaction of 3 and 4 with hydrogen peroxide using NMR and Raman spectroscopies, we concluded that the reaction leads to the formation of a titanium-hydroperoxide Ti-(eta(1)-OOH) moiety, which is directly involved in the epoxidation of the allylic alcohol 3-methyl-2-buten-1-ol. The combined use of both spectroscopies also led to understanding that a shift of the acidbase equilibrium toward the formation of Ti(eta(2)-O-2) and H3O+ correlates with the partial hydrolysis of the phosphotungstate scaffold in 3. In that case, the release of protons also catalyzed the oxirane opening of the in situ formed epoxide, leading to an increased selectivity for 1,2,3-butane-triol. In the case of the more stable [SbW9O33(tBuSiO)(3)Ti((OPr)-Pr-i)](3-) (4), the evolution to Ti(eta(2)-O-2) peroxide was not detected by Raman spectroscopy, and we performed reaction progress kinetic analysis by NMR monitoring the 3-methyl-2-buten-1-ol epoxidation to assess the efficiency and integrity of 4 as precatalyst.									28	0	0	0	3	0	28			2155-5435			WOS:000426804100078

Herein, mesoporous cobalt phosphide nanotubes (CoP-NTs) with a three-dimensional network structure have been obtained through a facile and efficient electrospinning technique combined with thermal stabilization and phosphorization treatments. The thermal stabilization process has been demonstrated to play a key role in the morphological tailoring of Co3O4 nanotubes (Co3O4NTs). As a result, the CoP-NTs show one-dimensional hollow tubular architecture instead of forming a worm-like tubular CoP structure (W-CoP-NTs) or severely aggregated CoP powder (CoP-NPs) which originate from the Co3O4 nanotubes without thermal stabilization treatment and Co3O4 nanoparticles, respectively. Satisfyingly, under an optimized phosphorization degree, the CoP-NT electrode exhibits a low onset overpotential of 53 mV with a low Tafel slope of 50 mV dec(-1) during the HER process. Furthermore, the CoP-NT electrode is capable of driving a large cathodic current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at an overpotential of 152 mV, which is much lower than those of its contrast samples, i.e. CoP-NPs (211 mV) and W-CoP-NTs (230 mV). Therefore, this work provides a feasible and general strategy for constructing three-dimensionally organized mesoporous non-noble metal phosphide nanotubes as promising alternative high-performance electrocatalysts for the commercial platinum ones.									38	3	0	0	1	0	38			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000414349100025	29048090

Nano-sized Al oxides were precipitated within the a-Fe matrix through a reaction between Fe-Al and Fe2O3 powders. Two types of oxides, FeAl2O4 and gamma-Al2O3, were found to precipitate during sintering at 1000 degrees C and the subsequent annealing at 800 degrees C. The oxides showed sluggish coarsening at 800 degrees C, which then provided high resistance to coarsening for the alpha-Fe grains. Microstructure observation and Vickers hardness measurement indicated that the homogeneous dispersion of oxides was achieved through the present procedure without ball milling.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			0921-5093	1873-4936		WOS:000466249400008

Complex 1 shows a bi-capped POM with the two Mo centers from the [Mo8O26](4-) moiety coordinated by two HL1 ligands via two Mo-N bonds. Complex 2 consists of a mononuclear unsaturated coordinated Co(II) unit and a [(P2Mo5O23MoII)-O-VI(H2O)(2)](4-) moiety, in which [(P2Mo5O23MoII)-O-VI(H2O)(2)](4-) shows a chain-like structure constructed from edge-sharing or vertexsharing {MoO6} and {PO4} polyhedra. The two complexes are both soluble in neutral aqueous solution and they can electrocatalyze the H-2 evolution reaction (HER) from water with lowered overpotentials and enhanced currents, and complex 1 shows better electrocatalytic activity for the HER than complex 2. Complex 1 shows visible-light photochromism. In the presence of complex 1, the HER current is enhanced with visible-light irradiation in comparison with the current without light irradiation.									8	0	0	0	0	0	8			1477-9226	1477-9234		WOS:000344250800044	25300197

Previously, we characterized both oxygenated intermediates by UV-vis and Mossbauer spectroscopy, proposed structures from DFT and QM/MM computational studies, and elucidated chemical steps involved in dioxygen activation through the kinetic studies of T201(peroxo) formation. In this study, we investigate the kinetics of T201(peroxo) decay to explore the reaction mechanism of the oxygenated intermediates following O-2 activation. The decay rates of T201(peroxo) were monitored in the absence and presence of external (phenol) or internal (tryptophan residue in an I100W variant) substrates under pre-steady-state conditions. Three possible reaction models for the formation and decay of T201(peroxo) were evaluated, and the results demonstrate that this species is on the pathway of arene oxidation and appears to be in equilibrium with ToMOH(peroxo).									16	0	0	0	7	0	16			0006-2960			WOS:000291292100027	21595439

Carbonaceous supports such as high surface area carbon provide electronic contact throughout the catalyst layer, isolate PMG nanoparticles (NPs) to maintain high electrochemical surface area, and provide hydrophobic properties to avoid flooding of the catalyst layer by liquid water produced. Compared to high surface area carbon, PMG catalysts supported on 1D and 2D carbon materials such as graphene and carbon nanotubes show enhanced activity and durability due to the intrinsic effect of the underlying carbonaceous supports on the electronic states of PMG NPs. The modification of the electronic environment, in particular the d-band centers of PMG NPs, weakens the adsorption of AOR intermediates, facilitates breaking of the C-C bonds, and thus enhances the electrocatalytic activity of PMG catalysts. The doping of heteroatoms further facilitates the electrocatalytic activity for the AOR through the structural, bifunctional, and electronic effects, in addition to the enhanced dispersion of PMG NPs in the carbon support. The prospects for the development of effective PMG-based catalysts for high-performance alcohol-fuel-based PEMFCs is discussed.									29	5	0	0	1	0	31			1864-5631	1864-564X		WOS:000525241800001	32068972

To do so we used the established cryogelation technique, in which nanoparticle units were frozen in liquid nitrogen and the ice-template was subsequently sublimated by a freeze-drying process, resulting in a 3D self-standing monolith of nanoparticles. The sample was characterized with different techniques to understand the evolution of the microscopic structure before and after exposure to catalytic environments. In addition, the synthesized materials were tested in the CO oxidation and in the oxidative methanol coupling, in the attempt to compare the prepared materials against established nanoporous gold systems synthesized by a top-down approach. The asprepared gold sample was inactive in the CO oxidation and surprisingly, highly active in the oxidative methanol coupling. A set of analyses revealed the presence of sodium species on the catalyst surface, which correlated to the extremely high activity of the catalyst. When such traces were removed, the pure gold samples was found to be inactive also in the methanol coupling reaction. Finally, our results proved that pure porous gold systems were not able to catalyze the investigated oxidation reactions, but instead traces of alkali metal ions in these systems could enhance the catalytic activity.

Herein, six-element HEOs (CoNiZnFeMnLi)(3)O-4 and (CoNiZnCrMnLi)(3)O-4 with spinel structure are successfully prepared by conventional solid-phase method and present outstanding lithium storage performances due to the synergy effect of various electrochemically active elements and the entropy stabilization. By contrast, (CoNiZnFeMnLi)(3)O-4 delivers higher initial discharge specific capacity of 1104.3 mAh.g(-1), better cycle stability (84% capacity retention after 100 cycles at 100 mA.g(-1)) and rate performance (293 mAh.g(-1) at 2000 mA.g(-1)) in the half-cell. Moreover, the full-cell assembled with (CoNiZnFeMnLi)(3)O-4 and LiCoO2 provides a reversible specific capacity of 260.2 mAh.g(-1) after 100 cycles at 500 mA.g(-1). Ex situ X-ray diffraction reveals the electrochemical reaction mechanism of HEOs (CoNiZnFeMnLi)(3)O-4, and the amorphous phase and the large amount of oxygen vacancies were obtained after the initial discharge process, which are responsible for the excellent cycle and rate performance. This research puts forward fresh insights for the development of advanced energy storage materials for high-performance batteries.									9	1	0	0	0	0	9			1001-0521	1867-7185		WOS:000723598000001		
J	Hilken, G; Brockmann, C; Nevermann, L								Hemocytes of the centipede Scutigera coleoptrata (Chilopoda, Notostigmophora) with notes on their interactions with the tracheae								JOURNAL OF MORPHOLOGY				257	2			181	189		10.1002/jmor.10108				AUG 2003	2003	The hemocytes of Scutigera coleoptrata were investigated by light and electron microscopy. Four types of hemocytes were identified: prohemocytes, plasmatocytes, granulocytes, and spherulocytes. Only granulocytes could be distinguished from the three other types by May-Grunwald staining, as this is the only hemocyte type demonstrating an eosinophilic reaction. Shape and size give further indications for distinguishing the cell types. In addition, differentiation is possible on the basis of their ultrastructure. However, only a combination of all three methods (staining and light and electron microscopy) allows clear separation of the cell types. As transitional stages between the cell types occur in S. coleoptrata, it is likely that prohemocytes, plasmatocytes, and granulocytes are ontogenetic stages of a single cell lineage. Special cell components and their possible functions are described. Plasmatocytes exocytose tubular structures that probably play a role in coagulation processes. These tubular structures develop in the grana of plasmatocytes. Also, a special arrangement of microtubules and microfilaments was demonstrated. For the first time interactions between hemocytes and tracheae are documented within the Chilopoda. It is assumed that the hemocytes meet their oxygen requirements directly from the tracheae. Phylogenetic implications of the results are discussed.									7	0	0	0	8	0	8			0362-2525	1097-4687		WOS:000184080000005	12833379

By investigating and comparing the removal efficiencies and chemical oxygen demand (COD) during the degradation process, higher bath voltage and alkaline condition were considered as more suitable for the 2,4-DCP decomposition. Higher initial 2,4-DCP concentration was attributed to the increase in the utilisation of the energy input. The plasma characteristics during CMPE were studied by optical emission spectroscopy (OES). It was found that the 2,4-DCP directly participated in the plasma discharge process. Furthermore, by studying the evolution of intermediate products at different experimental parameters, it was found that the existence of Cl(-)played an important role in the opening of benzene ring, which activated the ortho-substitutions of hydroxyl, meanwhile accelerated the p-substitutions. The instantaneous high temperature and high pressure and the Cl(-)that were generated and driven by cathodic plasma made the decomposition of 2,4-DCP much quicker.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0959-3330	1479-487X		WOS:000555205400001	32674672

Non-equivalent facets of a catalyst are known to possess different charge distribution properties. Here, we report that hexagonal 6H-SiC, a metal-free, environmentally friendly, polar semiconductor, exhibits different charge distribution and photocatalytic properties on naturally occurring Si-{0001} and {10-10} facets. Very strong selectivity of metals in situ photodeposition occurs in these two facets, demonstrating that the photo-excited electrons are assembled only on polar Si-{0001} facets while the holes are assembled on non-polar {10-10} facets. Consequently, reduction reactions occur only on the Si-{0001} facets with noble metals, and meantime oxidation occurs only in {10-10} with metal oxide. We show that the activity of photocatalytic water splitting is significantly enhanced by this kind of selective depositions resulting from the charge spatial separation. The underlying mechanism is investigated in terms of experimental evidence and first principles calculations. Our results demonstrate that the utilization of facets with opposite catalytic characteristics could be a feasible means to enhance the photocatalytic performance in diverse semiconducting materials. This is, in particular, of interest for polar semiconductors, as their particles always naturally occur in both polar facets and non-polar ones without needing facet engineering.									14	0	0	0	1	0	14			1463-9076	1463-9084		WOS:000425107800019	29383351

Herein, uniform single-crystal Bi-.333(Bi6S9)Br nanorods were synthesized for the first time using a one-pot hydrothermal method. By prolonging the hydrothermal reaction time, the evolution process of Bi-.333(Bi6S9)Br from nanoparticles to short nanorods, and finally to long nanorods was observed. Bi-.333(Bi6S9)Br nanorods can effectively inhibit the recombination of photogenerated electron-hole pairs and effectively adsorb of Cr (VI) due to the presence of surface defects and unique structure, thereby promoting the photocatalytic activity. Bi-.333(Bi6S9)Br nanorods exhibited excellent photocatalytic performance as well as promising recyclability in rapidly reducing aqueous Cr (VI) to Cr (III) under visible light. The degradation rate of Cr (VI) reached 90.96% within 60 min, and the structure of Bi-.333(Bi6S9)Br did not change after six photocatalytic cycles. The photocatalytic reaction mechanism of nanorods was proposed based on the band structure of Bi-.333(Bi6S9)Br and electron spin resonance radical scavenging assay. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

However, this strategy has rarely been applied in Potassium Perchlorate (KClO4)-containing energetic materials, even though KClO4 is a much stronger oxidizer than most previously reported metal-oxide oxidizer. One of the main obstacles is the lack of simple and in situ ways to introduce KClO4 into the composite. In present work, micrometer KClO4/Zirconium (KClO4/Zr) composite particles were successfully prepared using a facile chemical solution-deposition method. The structure and particle morphologies of as-obtained KClO4/Zr composite were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and scanning electronic microscope (SEM)-EDS (Energy Dispersive Spectrometer). The evolutionary combustion behavior was evaluated using flame-based light-radiation spectra and successive photography technique. Results showed that the morphology, light-radiation properties and flame-evolution characteristics of KClO4/Zr composite varied with the content of KClO4 and the particle size of Zr. Compared with the mechanical mixture of KClO4/Zr, the KClO4/Zr composite showed much higher light-radiation intensity and longer light-emission duration time after reasonably controlling the preparation parameters. Flame photographs revealed that the enhanced light radiation of KClO4/Zr composite should be ascribed to higher use efficiency of oxygen in the oxidizer, which promoted both the solid-solid and solid-gas reaction pathways between KClO4 and Zr.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			1996-1944			WOS:000459719000003

The experimental approach allowed to study the precursor thermal behaviour upon heating, continuously monitoring the evolution of its structural features determined by NH4 ions and TMA calcination and dehydration processes. The activation of the precursor (H-omega sample) is fully reached at similar to 600 degrees C, when all the NH4 content has been released, dehydration mostly occurred and TMA degradation completed. From a structural point of view, Rietveld structural refinements highlighted relevant structural changes. In particular variations in intertetrahedral angles allowed to make hypothesis about the possible distribution of Bronsted acid sites on the framework oxygen atoms. The hypothesis was corroborated through the neutron Rietveld refinement of the deuterated and calcined omega (D-omega sample) that revealed the presence of two acid sites: D1 and D2 located on O5 and O2 framework oxygen atoms, respectively. Besides, neutron data confirmed the strong relation among framework and Br:misted acid sites geometry and short- and/or long-range interactions. In summary, non-conventional sources were successfully used to probe both activation and formation of acidic sites in omega precursor as well as determine the number and location of Bronsted sites in the deuterated omega.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1387-1811	1873-3093		WOS:000618750400003

X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) and X-ray photoelectron (XPS) spectroscopes confirm that the composition of the as-fabricated product. Field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), selected area electron diffraction (SA-ED), high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM) and N-2 adsorption-desorption isotherm reveal that the as-synthesized sample exhibits a microsized flower-like crystal with dense nanoleaves standing on their surfaces, polycrystalline, monoclinic phase structure and high BET surface area. On the basis of time-dependent experimental results, a possible mechanism for the formation of flowerlike structures is speculated. Their capability of catalytic degradation of formaldehyde solution with oxygen air bubbles were studied by using an acetylacetone calorimetric spectra, total organic carbon (TOC) method and turnover number (TON). In addition, the birnessite nanoflower is stable during the reaction and can be used repeatedly. (C) 2014 Elsevier Masson SAS.

Here, a novel Bi-based metal-organic framework (Bi-MBA, MBA=4-mercaptobenzoic acid) with excellent photocatalytic reduction activities is developed. The E-CB of Bi-MBA locates at -1.38 eV, which is able to efficiently reduce O-2, Cr-VI and CO2. Theoretical calculations reveal the significant contribution of organic ligand (MBA) to the conduction band. Our results provide an effective route to improve the photocatalytic reduction activities of Bi-based photocatalysts.									6	1	0	0	0	0	6			1864-5631	1864-564X		WOS:000596874700001	33300683

J	Fox, JL								Spectrum of hot O at the exobases of the terrestrial planets								JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-SPACE PHYSICS				102	A11			24005	24011		10.1029/97JA02089				NOV 1 1997	1997	The distribution of energetic O produced in dissociative recombination of O-2(+) at the exobases of the terrestrial planets is important in determining the structure of the outer hot O coronas and for the escape flux of O from Mars. Using recently measured values for the branching ratios of the energetically allowed channels in O-2(+) dissociative recombination, along with models of the vibrational distribution of O-2(+), we compute the velocity distribution of hot O atoms produced at the exobases of Mars, Venus, and Earth. We take into account the effects of the ion and electron temperatures, the rotational energy of the ions and the decrease of the dissociative recombination cross section with relative velocity of the ion and electron. We find that distinct peaks appear at the energies associated with the various channels in the Martian spectrum but that for Venus, the features are less distinct, and for Earth, the distribution appears as a single, but broad and asymmetrical peak. For Mars, we compute the fractions of atoms produced with speeds greater than the escape velocity for O-16, O-17, and O-17 of 0.68, 0.64, and 0.58, respectively. Thus there is a small isotope effect inherent in the dissociative recombination mechanism that has not been taken into account in models of Martian atmospheric evolution or in estimates of the total inventory of oxygen that is implied by the observed lack of enhancement of the heavier isotopes relative to the terrestrial values.									63	0	2	0	0	0	64						WOS:A1997YE92400001		
J	Wang, Hui; Du, Hongxia; Zeng, Shufang; Pan, Xiaoli; Cheng, Hao; Liu, Lei; Luo, Feng								Explore the difference between the single-chamber and dual-chamber microbial electrosynthesis for biogas production performance								BIOELECTROCHEMISTRY				138						107726	10.1016/j.bioelechem.2020.107726		JAN 2021		APR 2021	2021	Microbial electrosynthesis (MES) is an advanced technology for efficient treatment of organic wastewater and recovery of new energy, with the advantages and disadvantages of single-chamber and dual-chamber MES reactors being less understood. Therefore, we explored the effects of single-chamber and dual-chamber structures on the methane production performance and microbial community structure of MES. Results indicated that methane concentration and current density of single-chamber MES were higher than those of dual-chamber MES, and the system stability was better, while chemical oxygen demand (COD) removal rate and cumulative methane production were not significantly different. Analysis of microbial community structure showed the abundance of acidogens and H-2-producing bacteria was higher in single-chamber MES, while fermentation bacteria and methanogens was lower. The abundance of methanogens of dual-chamber MES (21.74-24.70%) was superior to the single-chamber MES (8.23-10.10%). Moreover, in dual-chamber MES, methane was produced primarily through aceto-clastic methanogenic pathway, while in single-chamber MES cathode, methane production was mainly by hydrogenotrophic methanogenic pathway. Information provided will be useful to select suitable reactors and optimize reaction design. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

Three compounds were designed and investigated. Good linear evolutions of the molecular weight (Mn) with the conversion were observed. A comparison was provided with a reference iridium (III) complex [Ir(ppy)3 where ppy stands for 2-phenylpyridine]. The on/off photopolymerization experiments highlight the presence of dormant species and a re-initiation on demand upon irradiation. This unique re-initiation property was used for the modification of surfaces (hydrophilic/hydrophobic properties) and surface patterning as well as the synthesis of a block co-polymer (PMMA-b-PBA). A comparative analysis of the behavior of these iron complexes in thermally and photochemically activated polymerization was provided. The chemical mechanisms were studied by steady state photolysis, laser flash photolysis, cyclic voltammetry, luminescence quenching, and electron spin resonance experiments. A catalytic cycle was proposed with two steps: (i) the oxidation of the FeC excited state by an alkyl halide and (ii) the reduction by the oxidized form (FeC degrees+) by an amine or the macroradicals leading to the regeneration of the catalyst.

To enhance the performance and durability of formic acid oxidation reaction in fuel-cell applications, we prepared a platinum-gold (PtAu) nanocatalyst with controlled morphology and composition. The catalyst is further treated by calcination under controlled temperature and atmosphere. The morphology of the bimetallic nanoparticles is determined by transmission electron microscopy. The nanoscale phase properties and surface composition are carried out by X-ray diffraction and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. Cyclic voltammetry measurements demonstrated that the catalytic activity is highly dependent on the nanoscale evolution of alloying and phase segregation. The mass activity of as-prepared Pt50Au50/C with 600 degrees C treatment temperature is about 11 times higher than that of commercial Pt/C. Stability tests showed no obvious loss of activity after 500 potential cycles. The high activity and stability are attributed to lattice contraction effect as a result of the high thermal treatment condition. Our findings demonstrate the importance of phase segregation at the nanoscale in harnessing the true electrocatalytic potential of bimetallic nanoparticles. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

However, fabrication of 2D heteromaterials with clean and seamless interfaces remains challenging. Here, a 2D tungsten carbide/tungsten trioxide (WC/WO3) heterogeneous hybrid in situ synthesized by a chemical engineering method has been reported. The hybrid comprises of layer-by-layer stacked WC and WO3 monolayers. The WC and specific interfacial interfaces between the WC and WO3 layers exhibit synergetic effects, promoting interfacial charge transfer and separation. Binderless WC performing platinum-like behavior works as a potential substitute for noble metals and accelerates multielectron oxygen reduction, consequently speeding up the photocatalytic decomposition of organic compounds over the WO3 catalyst. The specific interfacial interaction between WC and WO3 layers potentially improves interfacial charge transfer from conduction band of WO3 to WC. In the absence of noble metals, the WC/WO3 hybrid as a catalyst exhibits distinct decomposition of organic compounds with vis-NIR light ( = 400-800 nm). This finding provides a cost-effective approach to capture low-energy photons in environmental remediation applications.									63	6	0	0	5	0	63			1616-301X	1616-3028		WOS:000427110100005

TG-DSC-MS measurements were carried out under non-isothermal and isothermal conditions. The samples were heated up in series to 1573, 1673 and 1773 K. Four stages of the process were distinguished. In the first, endothermic stage, evolution of volatile products contained in raw samples took place. In the second, exothermic stage, oxidation of nc-Ti-Si-C-N/C contained in raw samples occured by the oxygen present in argon at a trace level. At the third stage pyrolysis of organic compounds, present in the samples, and carbonization of nc-Ti-Si-C-N/C, and in the fourth stage oxidation of purified composite by oxygen occurring in argon proceeded. Kinetic description of the process was presented at the example of series heated up to 1773 K. Coats-Redfern equation was applied. The kinetic models (forms of g(a) function) and Arrhenius parameters A and E were determined for the stages. An analysis of the process was performed using the obtained kinetic data.

As scaled-up anodes for practical use, metallic anodes are preferable. In this study, Fe, Ni, and Fe-Ni metals were electrochemically examined and the results indicate that Ni metal coated with NiO is a promising anode material. Ni metal is easily dissolved in LiCl in the form of Ni2+ ions over the potential range >2.3 V (vs Li+/Li). However, in LiCl-Li2O, after NiO was formed at the surface of Ni metal, the dissolution of Ni2+ ions was inhibited and O-2 evolution occurred over the potential range >2.6 V at a high current density. Oxygen gas was stably evolved during current-controlled electrolysis at currents up to 0.6 A (0.94 A cm(-2)) performed using a Ni rod anode of 3 mm diameter, which was heat-treated in air and covered with a MgO protective tube at around the interface between the melt and the cover gas. Moreover, it was demonstrated that about 100 g of UO2 was completely reduced to the metallic form in 8.7 h using a Ni plate anode.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0013-4651	1945-7111		WOS:000806521100001

The phase composition and anti-oxidation behavior of the coatings were investigated. The results show that the coating was composed of MoSi2, alpha-SiC and beta-SiC. By the variations of Gibbs free energy (calculated by HSC Chemistry 6.0 software), it could be suggested that the SiC coating formed at low temperatures by solution-reprecipitation mechanism and at high temperatures by gas-phase reactions and solution-reprecipitation mechanisms simultaneously. SiC nanoparticles could improve the oxidation resistance of SiC/MoSi2-SiC multiphase coating. Addition of SiC nanoparticles increases toughness of the coating and prevents spreading of the oxygen diffusion channels in the coating during the oxidation test. The mass loss and oxidation rate of the SiC nanoparticle toughened-SiC/MoSi2-SiC-coated sample after 10-h oxidation at 1773 K were only 1.76% and 0.32 x 10(-2) g/cm(3)/h, respectively.									23	1	0	0	0	0	24			1059-9495	1544-1024		WOS:000402734000043

Using multivariate analysis on major and minor ion compositions normalized by Cl- content, chemical constituents were combined into two principal components representing brine mixing and mineral precipitation. Comparing to multivariate analysis on the original data, this procedure reveals more geochemical information. It demonstrates that the brine groundwater of the region is primarily composed of highly evaporated seawater. The evaporation ratio is > 70%; a point at which calcite, dolomite and gypsum precipitate. Oxygen and hydrogen isotopic compositions confirm this inference; and further, geochemical modeling quantitatively determined the evaporation ratio to be about 85%. Natural boron contamination is a consequence of brine groundwater. Two evolutionary trends in the plotting of the Cl/B ratio versus Cl- can be identified: (1) Cl/B ratio decreases with boron being released from clay minerals when brine aquifers are flushed with freshwater; and (2) Cl/B ratio increases when seawater of a high Cl/B ratio infiltrates coastal aquifers.									16	0	0	0	8	0	16			0943-0105			WOS:000257224100010

The use of bio-enzymes, however, shadows some highlights of these methods due to their vulnerable activities against environments. Herein, we report a novel biosensor for the natural enzyme-free colorimetric detection of UA by using CoP nanosheet arrays grown on Ni foam (NF) as a monolithic peroxidase mimic. The integrated nanozyme can be put into and taken out from reaction systems conveniently with only tweezers, making it possible for on-demand analysis. As demonstrated, the obtained CoP/NF exhibits outstanding peroxidase-like activity to trigger the oxidation reaction of colorless 3,305,50-tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) to a blue product (TMBox) mediated by H2O2. It is found that the blue TMBox can be reduced to colorless TMB again by UA selectively, thus the presence of UA in solutions will suppress the color reaction of TMB. Based on this principle, an uricase-free biosensor is developed for the photometric determination of UA, providing a wide detection range of 1-200 mu M and a limit of detection down to 1.0 mu M. In addition, the fabricated biosensor can be applied for measuring UA in clinical samples with merits of simple operation and good reliability, exhibiting its great promise in clinical diagnosis.

In Paragonimus westermani, 2 cDNAs were found to encode Mbs. The first clone, Pwmyol, codes a total of 149 amino acids with a calculated mass of 16.6 kDa. The second, Pwmyo2, encodes a 146-amino acid protein with a calculated mass of 16.2 kDa. The predicted secondary structures showed the presence of 8 helices, which is the basic characteristic of Mbs. Sequence alignment revealed a high homology with the other trematode Mbs. The 2 clones contained the characteristic tyrosyl residues at helical positions 1310 and distal E7, which are substitutions that have been previously shown to contribute to the high oxygen affinity of Mbs. Polyclonal antibodies against the recombinant Mbs were raised with no cross-reactivity observed. Immunolocalization revealed the proteins to be distributed generally throughout the parenchymal tissues, but absent from the tegument and reproductive organs. The cell mass of the eggs of the worm stained positive to Pwmyo2 but not Pwmyol, suggesting the stage-specific expression of these Mbs.									6	0	0	0	5	0	6			0022-3395	1937-2345		WOS:000245221400015	17436948

TiO2 codoped with antimony and chromium evolved O-2 from an aqueous silver nitrate solution under visible light irradiation, while SrTiO3 codoped with antimony and chromium evolved H-2 from an aqueous methanol solution. The activity of TiO2 photocatalyst codoped with antimony and chromium was remarkably higher than that of TiO2 doped with only chromium. It was due to that the charge balance was kept by codoping of Sb5+ and Cr3+ ions, resulting in the suppression of formation of Cr6+ ions and oxygen defects in the lattice which should work as effectively nonradiative recombination centers between photogenerated electrons and holes.									733	69	0	0	47	1	773			1520-6106			WOS:000175601100018		
J	Schoenenberger, Johannes; Markl, Gregor								The magmatic and fluid evolution of the motzfeldt intrusion in South Greenland: Insights into the formation of agpaitic and miaskitic rocks								JOURNAL OF PETROLOGY				49	9			1549	1577		10.1093/petrology/egn037				SEP 2008	2008	The 1.275 Ga Motzfeldt intrusive complex in the Gardar failed-rift Province in South Greenland formed from six successively intruding melt batches (SM1-SM6) interpreted to be derived from a common magma source at depth. Five units (SM1-SM5) crystallized an alkaline to peralkaline, miaskitic mineral assemblage of amphibole, clinopyroxene, feldspar, nepheline, Fe-Ti oxides, zircon, apatite, fluorite and rarely olivine. The last magmatic batch (SM6) is characterized by an agpaitic mineral assemblage of aegirine, nepheline, alkali-feldspar, eudialyte and rare fluorite or sodalite. Coexisting mafic minerals constrain the crystallization conditions of the miaskitic rocks to about 850-600 degrees C, whereas solidus temperatures below 500 degrees C are indicated by coexisting alkali feldspars in the agpaitic rocks. Oxygen fugacities during the orthomagmatic stage are below the FMQ (fayalitemagnetite-quartz) buffer (Delta FMQ 05 to 20) whereas late hematite provides evidence of a higher relative oxygen fugacity during late-stage alteration. The Nd and oxygen isotope compositions of amphiboles and pyroxenes are homogeneous throughout the complex and suggest a common, mantle-derived magma source for all six units which is comparable with other Gardar intrusions. The hydrogen isotopic composition of amphiboles (delta D-99 to 132 parts per thousand) indicates low-temperature fluid-rock interaction with low fluid-rock ratios. Fluid inclusion studies indicate that H2O-NaCl fluids present during the magmatic stages in the miaskitic units had salinities of <10 wt % NaCl eq. Calcite crystals in fluid inclusions within these rocks suggest that CO2 or HCO3 was an important component of the original fluid phase. In contrast, the agpaitic unit is characterized by a CH4-H2O-NaCl fluid. The C-O-H isotope compositions of the fluid inclusions in all units are consistent with mixing between a small volume of magmatic fluid and a large volume of meteoric water. The chemical evolution of the Motzfeldt complex is a type example of the connection of the transition from miaskitic to agpaitic mineral assemblages with redox-dependent fluid-solid equilibria. The transition from a relatively oxidized to a relatively reduced fluid is correlated with a change from a more reduced, Fe2+-bearing miaskitic (taramite-arfvedsonite, zircon, SM1-SM5) to a more oxidized, Fe3+-bearing agpaitic assemblage (aegirine, eudialyte, SM6). We suggest that coupled fluid-solid redox equilibria involving Fe2+, Fe3+, CO2 and CH4 in this case were simply driven by temperature decrease and an overall increase in Na (+K) in the melt. This observation sheds light on the heavily debated miaskite-agpaite transition. The combined temperature and compositional effect stabilized Fe3+, CH4 and enhanced the solubility of Zr (possibly as Na-Zr-Si-O complexes) in the latest stage melt (SM6) resulting in the crystallization of an agpaitic mineral assemblage. In terms of redox conditions during crystallization, the Motzfeldt rocks represent an intermediate case in the Gardar Province between more oxidized, CO2-dominated intrusions such as the syenite-carbonatite complex of Gronnedal-Ika and CH4-dominated, more reduced complexes such as the peralkaline granitic Puklen and the agpaitic Ilimaussaq complex.									38	0	1	0	1	0	39			0022-3530	1460-2415		WOS:000259328100001

N-doped carbon materials offer a promising platform for the design and synthesis of electrocatalysts due to their high ORR activity, high surface area, and tunable porosity. In this study, materials in which MnO nanoparticles are entrapped in N-doped mesoporous carbon (MnO/NC) were developed as electrocatalysts for the ORR, and their performances were evaluated in zinc-air batteries. The obtained carbon materials had large surface area and high electrocatalytic activity toward the ORR. The carbon compounds were fabricated by using NaCl as template in a one-pot process, which significantly simplifies the procedure for preparing mesoporous carbon materials and in turn reduces the total cost. A primary zinc-air battery based on this material exhibits an open-circuit voltage of 1.49 V, which is higher than that of conventional zinc-air batteries with Pt/C (Pt/C cell) as ORR catalyst (1.41 V). The assembled zinc-air battery delivered a peak power density of 168 mW cm(-2) at a current density of about 200 mA cm(-2), which is higher than that of an equivalent Pt/C cell (151 mW cm(-2) at a current density of ca. 200 mA cm(-2)). The electrocatalytic data revealed that MnO/NC is a promising nonprecious-metal ORR catalyst for practical applications in metal-air batteries.									25	0	0	0	2	0	25			0947-6539	1521-3765		WOS:000459323700029	30548500

This technique endowed an excellent solar-driven water splitting activity for both the bare photoanode and that modified with tri-layers of non-precious water oxidation catalysts. The presence of EMI triflate in the precursor solution is essential for the mechanical stability of the film. Moreover, carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen of the EMI triflate were left over in the resulting film, and they did not affect its crystalline phase.									28	0	0	0	1	0	28			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000398889600005

One of the most promising applications of firefly luciferase is biosensors. In order to develop an apoptosis biosensor based on caspase 3/7, we have generated 3 forms of circularly permuted variants of Photinus pyralis firefly luciferase and a relatively good tolerance toward disruption of the polypeptide chain by introduction of new termini were found. Two forms of circular permuted luciferases showed significant activity enhancement in comparison with control after exposure to caspase 3. Moreover, the effect of circular permutation and also the length of inserted peptide (caspase 3/7 recognition sites) in structure of firefly luciferase were analyzed using circular dichroism and fluorescence spectroscopy.

Hydroxyl radicals mediated chlorine generation is the major pathway (indirect pathway) on the blue TNA which showed lower efficiency than direct pathway on dimensionally stable anodes. In this study, RuO2 coated blue TNA (blue TNA-RuO2) was fabricated, which exhibited a higher current efficiency (96%) than that of the blue TNA and RuO2. The excellent performance of the blue TNA-RuO2 is attributed to the simultaneous reaction of direct pathway on the RuO2 and indirect pathway on the blue NTA together.

However, the mechanism of this improvement has not been satisfactory described yet. The PEC water oxidation (oxygen evolution) at the interface of TiO2 photoanode and electrolyte solution is determined by the fraction of the photogenerated holes that reach the solution and it is defined as the hole transfer efficiency. The surface and bulk recombination processes in semiconductor photoanodes majorly influence the hole transfer efficiency. In this work, we study the hole transfer process involved in mixed-phase TiO2 nanotube arrays/solution junction using intensity-modulated photocurrent and photovoltage spectroscopy (IMPS and IMVS); then, we correlate the obtained hole transfer rate constants to (photo)electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (PEIS) measurements. The results suggest that the enhanced performance of the TiO2 mixed-phase is due to the improved hole transfer rate across the TiO2/liquid interface as well as to the decrease in the surface trap recombination of the holes.									31	0	0	0	4	0	31			2073-4344			WOS:000460702200098

At temperatures higher than 2 x 10(7) K, the CNO cycle dominates the energy production. In particular, its rate is determined by the slowest reaction: N-14(p,gamma)O-15. Direct measurement in a laboratory at the surface of the Earth is hampered by the background due to the cosmic rays. Here we report on an experiment performed with the LUNA ((L) under bar aboratory for (U) under bar nderground (N) under bar uclear (A) under bar strophysics) accelerator placed deep underground in the INFN Gran Sasso laboratory (Italy). Thanks to the cosmic ray suppression provided by the mountain shield, we could measure the N-14(p,gamma)O-15 cross section for the first time directly at energies corresponding to stellar temperatures and with unpreceedent accuracy. In particular we used a large solid angle BGO detector with a differentially pumped windowless gas target. The lowest measured energy is 70.1 keV. Our results have important consequences for the formation of carbon stars, for an independent lower limit on the age of the universe, and for solar neutrino flux.

As-deposited multilayers are amorphous structure. With the increase of temperature, Mo4O11 phase forms in the thin films without copper while MoO2 phase with the weak reduced molybdenum oxide appears in the copper-containing thin films. After annealing at the temperature higher than 450. C predominant MoO2 appears in the multilayered MoO3/Cu thin films. Meanwhile, CuO and Cu2O are also present in the thin films. The formation mechanism of reduced molybdenum suboxide can be explained by the oxygen-vacancy generation reaction or the reduction of MoO3 to MoO3-x via the inter-diffusion at the MoO3/Cu interfaces. The band gaps and conductivity activation energies of multilayered MoO3/Cu thin films decrease as the annealing temperature increases, in which the smallest band gap of similar to 2.05 eV and activation energy of similar to 0.02 eV for the MoO2 thin films are found. Our results open a new road to broaden the application of reduced molybdenum suboxides as a back contact material for CdTe solar cells.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			1369-8001	1873-4081		WOS:000600423400001

Although various methods have been developed to decorate cocatalysts on semiconductors, in situ depositing a transition metal oxide/oxyhydroxide catalyst in alkaline electrolyte remains a challenge. Herein, we present a facile in situ photo-assisted electrodeposition of ultrathin amorphous CoOxHy layer on hematite for efficient solar-driven water oxidation. Compared to Co(II) hydroxide, Co(III) hydroxide is much less soluble in alkaline electrolytes, thus being favorable for deposition above the anodic onset potential of Co(II)/(III). By using this metal valence dependent deposition-dissolution equilibrium, we prepared this highly efficient and adaptive CoOxHy layer on hematite for OER in 1.0 M NaOH containing 1.0 mu M Co(II). This method is promising for loading cocatalysts on semiconductors for solar-driven water splitting and is general for developing in situ (photo)electrochemical deposition of nanoscale catalysts.									16	3	0	0	1	0	16			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000510526000052

A total of 24 additional polyoxoanion and other precatalysts have also been surveyed for their DTBC dioxygenase activity. The four exemplary precatalyst complexes are the trivanadium(V)-containing, orange-red parent polyoxoanions (n-Bu4N)(7)[SiW9V3O40], I, and (n-Bu4N)(9)[P2W15V3O62].

P2W15V3O62], IV Careful, high (95 +/- 5%) mass balance studies are reported, studies rare in the dioxygenase literature, but studies made possible in the case of I-IV by their high activity and long lifetimes which yielded sizable amounts of isolable, and thus unequivocally characterizable, products (the characterization of products 2, 3, 4, and 6 includes single-crystal X-ray crystallography structures): 3,5-di-tert-butyl-1-oxacyclohepta-3,5-diene-2,7-dione (muconic acid anhydride), 2; 4,6-di-tert-butyl-2H-pyran-2-one, 3; a new, previously unidentified product (once misidentified in the literature), spiro[1,4-benzodioxin-2(3H), 2'-[2H]pyran]-3-one, 4',6,6',8-tetrakis(1,1-dimethylethyl), 4; 3,5-di-tert-butyl-5-(carboxymethyl)-2-furanone, 5; and the autoxidation product, 3,5-di-tert-butyl-1,2-benzoquinone, 6. Quantitative yields for each of the above products are also reported. Solvent effects on the dioxygenase reaction are evaluated by survey studies in 5 solvents; the highest yields are observed in non-coordinating solvents such as 1,2-dichloroethane. Oxygen uptake studies are reported; the results confirm the 1 O-2:1 DTBC stoichiometry which defines a catechol dioxygenase and address, for the first time, the details of how this similar to 1:1 stoichiometry actually arises from the Linear combination of the individual stoichiometries of the five, formally parallel, major reactions yielding the five major products. Initial kinetic studies are also reported; the O-2 uptake kinetics reveal a novel product and catalyst evolution mechanism consisting of an A --> B induction period, followed by an A + B --> 2 B autocatalytic step for complexes I and III, where A = O-2 and B is a product of the DTBC plus O-2 reaction Catalyst lifetime experiments with (n-Bu4N)(5)[(CH3CN)(x)Fe .

The long-term goal of such studies is the development of even longer-lived, more selective dioxygenase catalysts able to oxygenate the full range of interesting substrates of enzymic dioxygenases, as well as abiological substrates such as propene.									105	1	0	0	11	0	106			0002-7863			WOS:000083414400007

The self-condensation reaction of appropriate formyl or keto precursors with suitable polyamines can give rise to well-defined planar or tridimensional macrocyclic or macroacyclic Schiff bases, but different reaction pathways can also occur. Illustrative examples of [1 + 1], [2 + 2], [2 + 3] condensation products and of unexpected compounds are included.Moreover, the role of metal ions as templating agents and the capability of several Schiff base complexes to undergo transmetallation reactions are reported. Ring expansion and ring contraction processes of the macrocyclic cavity of Schiff bases occur and the experimental conditions for the obtainment or the stabilization of one isomer with respect to the others, in the presence or in the absence of suitable metal ions, are discussed.The preparation of functionalized ligands, containing pendant arms, capable of promoting dynamic complexation-decomplexation processes and their use in selective metal ion transportation and separation are also evaluated.The formation of polydentate, particularly macrocyclic, Schiff base complexes, followed by reductive demetallation with NaBH4 is also discussed especially for the obtention of more stable, flexible and versatile ligands useful in metal transfer studies.The synthetic strategies for the preparation of macrocyclic and/or macroacyclic mononuclear and polynuclear complexes from these Schiff bases are outlined. For mononuclear and dinuclear complexes only the most recent and significant examples are considered, while particular attention is devoted to the preparation of ligands capable of organizing more than two metal centres into a predetermined arrangement.Different synthetic strategies for the assembly of polynuclear molecular arrays are studied and the synthesis of trinuclear, tetranuclear, hexanuclear, dodecanuclear etc. complexes together with their properties (especially the structural and magnetic aspects) are discussed in detail. In particular the enlargement of the macrocyclic cavity, the introduction of suitable bridging groups or the use of ''spacers'' between dinuclear entities to obtain polynuclear complexes with predetermined properties are considered in detail.Finally some related systems, such as polyaza macrocycles, compartmental ligands etc., also capable of forming polynuclear systems, are briefly discussed.									472	9	1	0	14	3	475			0010-8545	1873-3840		WOS:A1995QL69800002

The size-selected clusters were deposited as positive ions on an amorphous carbon substrate at 5 eV. Silicon cluster sticking probabilities (determined from Rutherford backscattering measurements) were 95% +/- 5%. XPS spectra were recorded both before and after exposure to O2. The unoxidized clusters showed no significant (> 0.2 eV) core levels shifts relative to bulk silicon. Oxygen adsorption was monitored by following the evolution of the O1s and Si2p core levels. While the results are qualitatively similar to those obtained for bulk silicon surfaces, the O2 sticking coefficients are much smaller (approximately 0.001 compared to approximately 0.1). The O2 sticking coefficients are similar to those observed for the larger clusters in the ps phase, however, the spectacular variations in the reactivity of the smaller clusters in the gas phase are not reproduced. All the deposited clusters have similar O2 sticking coefficients. A number of observations suggest that there are substantial cluster-cluster interactions on the substrate (possibly leading to coalescence and sintering).									47	0	0	0	0	0	47			0021-9606			WOS:A1992KA70600046

It is important to study the organic composition and structural characteristics of coal for the high-value utilization of coal. In order to reveal the difference of the composition and macromolecule structure of low molecular compounds in different grade coals,this study takes long flame coal,1 /3 coking coal,coking coal,meager-lean coal,lean coal,and anthracite as the research objects. THF soxhlet extraction is used to test the coal with GC /MS and ~(13)C NMR. The differences of THF soluble organic compounds in coals with different metamorphism degrees were compared,and the mechanism of chemical composition and structural parameters in coal gasification were discussed,so as to provide a reference for the study of coal composition and structure. The results show that ① THF soluble low molecular compounds in all kinds of coal are mainly oxygen-containing heteroatom compounds,in which long-chain aliphatic hydrocarbons and oxygen-containing compounds containing carboxyl group are mainly in low and medium metamorphic bituminous coal,and cyclic hydrocarbons and oxygen-containing compounds containing aldehyde group are mainly in high metamorphic coal. The content of aromatic hydrocarbon is less than that of aliphatic compounds,and the types of soluble compounds increase first and then decrease with the degree of metamorphism. ② THF extraction has little effect on the carbon number of aromatic structure,which shows that the calculated aromatic carbon ratio(f_a ')after the dissolution of low molecular weight compounds has the same trend as that of raw coal,and decreases first and then increases with the increase of coal evolution degree. ③ The changes of composition and macromolecular structure of soluble low molecular weight compounds in bituminous coal and anthracite are staged. During the second jump of coalification(0.5%-1.3%,R_(o,max)),the low molecular weight carboxyl compounds gradually decrease and even disappear,while the structure of aromatic ring is changed from the benzene and naphthalene of 1-2 ring to the benzene,naphthalene and anthracene of 1-3 ring. In the third jump(R_(o,max) is about 2.0%),the aromatic condensation reaction intensifies,the basic aromatic structure unit increases,and the condensed ring of pyrene and other four ring structure appear. The strong pyrolysis makes the low molecular weight compounds separate from the coal,and the soluble components decrease significantly. It is considered that the variation of THF solvent extraction rate and composition of different grade coals is the result of the different content and type of soluble low molecular compounds generated in the process of coalification,the mode of occurrence,and the force between soluble low molecular compounds and solvent and macromolecular structure.			煤是由有机质和少量矿物质组成的混合岩,其中有机质组成和结构直接影响着煤的高效清洁利用,研究煤的有机组成和结构特征对煤炭高值化利用具有重要意义。为了揭示不同煤阶煤中低分子化合物组成和大分子结构的差异,以长焰煤、1 /3焦煤、焦煤、贫瘦煤、贫煤和无烟煤等不同变质程度煤为研究对象,采用四氢呋喃(THF)索氏萃取,借助于气相色谱-质谱(GC /MS)和核磁共振碳谱(~(13)C-NMR)等测试手段,比较了不同变质程度煤中THF可溶有机化合物的差异,探讨了煤化过程中化学组成和结构参数的变化机制,以期为煤组成和结构研究提供参考。结果表明: ①各类煤中的THF可溶低分子化合物均以含氧杂原子化合物为主,其中低、中变质的烟煤中以长链脂肪烃和含羧基的含氧化合物为主,高变质程度煤中以环烃和含醛基的含氧化合物为主。其次为脂肪类化合物,芳烃含量较少,且随着变质程度的加深,可溶组分的化合物类型呈先增多后减少的趋势。② THF萃取作用对芳香碳数影响较小,表现为低分子化合物溶出后计算得到的芳碳率(f_a ')与原煤变化趋势相同,均随着煤演化程度增大,表现出先减小后增大的变化趋势。③烟煤和无烟煤中可溶低分子化合物组成和大分子结构的变化呈现阶段性:煤化作用第2次跃变期间(0.5% ~ 1.3%,R_(o,max)),羧基类低分子化合物逐渐减少甚至消失,芳环结构由1 ~ 2环的苯、萘等结构转化为1~3环的苯、萘、蒽等结构,进入第3次跃变(R_(o,max)在2.0%左右)阶段,芳香缩合反应加剧,芳香基本结构单元增大,出现芘等4环结构的稠环,强烈的热裂解作用使得低分子化合物脱离煤体,可溶组分显著减少。研究认为,不同煤阶煤的THF溶剂萃取率及其组成的变化,是煤化作用过程中生成的可溶低分子化合物含量和种类、赋存方式,及可溶低分子化合物与溶剂、大分子结构间作用力大小的不同的结果。						0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0253-9993			CSCD:7153391

Indium of the ITO in both the ITO/polymer and polymer/ITO assemblies was found to diffuse towards the polymer at the interface. Oxygen migration was also observed at the ITO/polymer interfaces, The results obtained from in situ analysis by angle-resolved XPS of the interactions between thermally evaporated Mg and PPV and Mg and MEH-PPV indicated the formation of an interfacial layer in each case. The surface diffusion of adsorbed oxygen from the bulk of the conjugated polymer film played a dominant role in the interfacial reactions. The interfacial layer consisted of Mg oxides, Mg clusters, Mg metal and Mg-polymer complexes. Copyright (C) 2000 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.									15	0	0	0	0	0	15			0142-2421			WOS:000085491300001

Transport of ions in polymers involves various dynamical processes having different time scales. The time scale of ion dynamics depends on the number of monomer chains in the polymer, i.e., the molecular weight of the polymer. Polymers of high molecular weight contain regular arrangement of long chains of monomers which generally leads to high crystallinity. Copper, zinc and aluminum wires have been used for different reaction rates in the polymer-Ag salt solution. Anisotropy of the polymer-salt solution varies due to the change in the ion dynamics in high molecular weight polymer as compared to the low molecular weight polymer. Varying anisotropy leads to different aggregation patterns around the reactive metal wires. X-ray diffraction has been performed to determine the crystallinity while the voltage-time measurement has been done to validate the aggregation process. Effect of air exposure/oxidation on the growth patterns has also been considered as the adsorption of oxygen ions changes with the change in the crystallinity of the polymer.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3				2053-1591		WOS:000480300300007

To design efficient and affordable electrocatalysts for the hydrazine oxidation reaction (HzOR), one needs to control both the active site and the supporting scaffold. We now report a family of electrocatalysts for alkaline HzOR, consisting of atomically dispersed Fe-N-4 sites (as iron corroles of varying sizes) on hierarchically porous, electronically conductive carbon scaffolds that were prepared by self-templating from a novel barium-based precursor. The orthogonal design of active sites and flow-enhancing scaffolds allowed the rational optimization of their combination, to achieve excellent HzOR activity. These catalysts demonstrate the utility and versatility of metallocorroles for electrocatalysis in the nitrogen cycle, as well as the importance of pore tuning for optimization of the current density.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			2196-0216			WOS:000796239700001

In this work, coupling two coumarin molecules into a dimeric Keto-di-coumarin (K-2) molecule affords a long-lived triplet excited state (30.6 mu s), which was used as earth-abundant and heavy atom-free photosensitizers (PSs) for visible-light-driven hydrogen evolution. Its photocatalytic performance was dramatically improved to 61 times higher than that of Keto-mono-coumarin (K-1)-containing system. Both K-1 and K-2 show a strong visible light-absorbing ability with the molar extinction coefficient of 44000 M-1.cm(-1) at 470 nm and 71000 M-1.cm(-1) at 477 nm, respectively. Detail investigation of transient spectra confirmed that the much enhanced photocatalytic activity of K-2-containing system can be mainly ascribed to existence of long-lived triplet excited state of the dimer under visible light excitation, while K-1 just gave a short-lived singlet excited state (0.87 ns). Photocatalytic processes of K-2 were systematically investigated by transient absorption spectra and electrochemical methods, indicating that reductive quenching mechanism is the dominated process during the photocatalytic reactions. This work not only provide a low-cost and environment-friendly photocatalytic system with the earth-abundant pure organic PSs, but also open up an avenue to design heavy atom-free PSs with strong visible light harvesting ability and long-lived excited state for efficient hydrogen evolution.									7	0	0	0	0	0	7			0143-7208	1873-3743		WOS:000466823300009

The thermal gas phase decomposition of O3 at high temperatures (90-degrees-C, 110-degrees-C) produces isotopically heavy O2 with respect to precursor O3 with a non-mass-dependent fractionation pattern (delta-O-17 not-equal-to 0.5-delta-O-18). At 90-degrees-C, a noticeable component of heterogeneous decomposition is present, but is insignificant at 110-degrees-C. The product O2 from O3 photolysis by visible (532 nm) and UV light is depleted in the heavy isotopes, opposite from thermal decomposition. These well controlled experiments permit a quantitative kinetic analysis. A one-box, time-dependent model was used to simulate the evolution of the isotopic composition of the O2 and O3. The comparison of thermal and photolysis experiments indicates that the initial decomposition step is most likely responsible for the observed isotopic fractionations. Based upon detailed kinetic model calculations, the roles of isotope exchange reactions, initial O3 isotopic distribution, and various branching ratios of isotopic reactions involved in the isotopic fractionation have been examined. The possible importance of these conclusions for understanding stratospheric isotopically heavy O3, and possible implications for non-mass-dependent isotopic fractionations and chemical kinetic theory are discussed.									36	0	0	0	2	0	37			2169-897X			WOS:A1991FV27800010

Herein, a NiFe-based MOF supported on Ni foam was designed to obtain good OER and HER activities in alkaline media. Thanks to the 3-D hierarchical layer structure distributed on Ni foam, the high exposure of active sites, and the good conductance, as-obtained NiFe-MOF-5 presented advantages for its use in electrochemical catalysis. As a result, an overpotential of 168 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) for the OER was reached. Moreover, the catalyst only required a cell voltage of 1.57 V at 10 mA cm(-2) for overall water splitting, and it outperformed most previously reported non-precious-metal electrocatalysts in 1 M KOH.									20	0	0	0	0	0	20			2052-1553			WOS:000644496500001

The stripped protons contribute to a membrane electrochemical potential before combining with the stripped electrons to make chemical bonds and releasing O-2 for powering respiratory metabolisms. In this review, we provide an overview of the kinetics and thermodynamics of water oxidation that highlights the conserved performance of PSIIs across species. We discuss recent advances in our understanding of the site of water oxidation based upon the improved (1.9-angstrom resolution) atomic structure of the Mn4CaO5 water-oxidizing complex (WOC) within cyanobacterial PSII. We combine these insights with recent knowledge gained from studies of the biogenesis and assembly of the WOC (called photoassembly) to arrive at a proposed chemical mechanism for water oxidation.									255	2	0	0	147	0	258			0066-4154	1545-4509	978-0-8243-0882-7	WOS:000321698100021	23527694

Proper knowledge of transient and limiting pH values allows for a better understanding of the phenomena that take place during capacitor operation. It also enables the proper assignment of the reaction potentials responsible for water decomposition. It is shown that the pH inside the capacitor is strongly potential-dependent and different for individual electrodes; therefore, the values of the evolution potentials of hydrogen and oxygen cannot be precisely calculated based only on the initial pH of the electrolyte. The operando measurements indicate that the pH at the positive electrode reaches 4, while at the negative electrode, it is 8.5, which in theory could shift the theoretical operating voltage well beyond 1.23 V. On the other hand, high voltage cannot be easily maintained since the electrolyte of both electrode vicinities is subjected to mixing. Operando gas monitoring measurements show that the evolution of electrolysis byproducts occurs even below the theoretical decomposition voltage. These reactions are important in maintaining a voltage-advantaged pH difference within the cell. At the same time, the electrochemical quartz crystal microbalance (EQCM) measurements indicated that the ions governing the pH (OH-) that initially accumulated in the vicinity of the positive electrode enter the carbon porosity, losing their pH-governing abilities. pH fluctuations in the cell are important and play a vital role in the description of its performance during the cyclability at a given voltage. This is especially noticeable in cell floating at 1.3 V, where the pH difference between electrodes is the highest (6 units). The increase of the electrode separation distance acts similarly to the introduction of a semipermeable membrane toward the increase of the capacitor cycle life. During floating at 1.6 V, where the pH difference is not as high anymore (4 units), the influence of separation in terms of electrode stability, although present, is less notable.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000841231700001	35946232

The phase structure, dielectric, ferroelectric properties and complex impedance were investigated in detail. XRD and dielectric measurements determined that single orthorhombic phase displayed in (Ba0.85Ca0.15)(Zr0.1Ti0.9)O-3 at room temperature. With the introduction of Bi2O3/CuO, the phase structure exhibited the mixture of orthorhombic and tetragonal phases, and then turned to single tetragonal phase. In contrast to the sharp dielectric transition of (Ba0.85Ca0.15)(Zr0.1Ti0.9)O-3 ceramics, a broad dielectric peak coupled with a slight decrease in Curie temperature was observed in (Ba0.85Ca0.15-2x Bi-2x )(Zr0.1Ti0.9-x Cu (x) )O-3 ceramics with increasing x. The observed diffuse phase transition behavior was further confirmed by a couple of measurements with polarization loops and polarization current density curves. The structural and the composition fluctuations induced by ions doping should be responsible for the diffuse phase transition behavior. Furthermore, physical mechanisms of the conduction and relaxation processes were revealed by using impedance spectroscopy analyses. It was concluded that the conduction and relaxation processes were thermally activated, which was closely linked with the singly and doubly ionized oxygen vacancies.									10	0	0	0	0	0	10			0957-4522	1573-482X		WOS:000372166600012

Other typical PS II inhibitors, including DCMU, atrazine, ioxynil and dinoseb, showed no degradation activity. Occupation by another PS II inhibitor, DCMU, of the binding site of the secondary quinone acceptor, Q(B), prevented the D1 protein from PNO8-induced degradation. The degradation was inhibited at low temperature, but occurred even in the absence of oxygen. Moreover, an inhibitor of serine-type proteinase, PMSF, was effective in suppressing the D1 protein degradation. Photoinhibitory treatment of the membranes also induced a degradation product with an apparent molecular mass of 23 kDa that corresponds to the PNO8-induced 23 kDa fragment. The data were interpreted as indicating a selective and specific cleavage of the D1 protein triggered by binding of PNO8 to the Q(B) site, and the results were discussed in relation to the features of proteolytic degradation of the D1 protein in photoinhibition.									12	0	0	0	11	0	12			0005-2728	0006-3002		WOS:A1995RH03900005

This method is based on that of Burnap et al. [Burnap, R., Koike, H., Sotiropoulou, G., Sherman, L. A., & Inoue, Y. (1989) Photosynth. Res. 22, 123-130] but is modified so that the whole preparation, from cells to PS-II particles, is achieved in 10 h and involves only one purification step. The purified preparation exhibits a 5-6-fold increase of O2-evolution activity on a chlorophyll basis over the thylakoids. The ratio of PS-I to PS-II is about 0.14:1 in the preparation. The secondary quinone electron acceptor, Q(B), is present in this preparation as demonstrated by thermoluminescence studies. These PS-II particles are well-suited to spectroscopic studies as demonstrated by the range of EPR signals arising from components of PS-II that are easily detectable. Among the EPR signals presented are those from a formal S3-State, attributed to an oxidized amino acid interacting magnetically with the Mn complex in Ca2+-deficient PS-II particles, and from S2 Modified by the replacement of Ca2+ by Sr2+. Neither of these signals has been previously reported in cyanobacteria. Their detection under these conditions indicates a similar lesion caused by Ca2+ depletion in both plants and cyanobacteria. The protocol has also been applied to mutants which have site-specific changes in PS-II. Data are presented on mutants having changes on the electron donor (Y160F) and electron acceptor (G215W) side of the D2 polypeptide.									48	0	0	0	38	0	48			0006-2960			WOS:A1992HF26700030	1311205

However, few studies are available on the preparation of bimetallic nanoparticles supported on MoS2. Herein, a facile and efficient method to synthesize MoS2-PtAg nanohybrids by decorating ultrathin MoS2 nanosheets with octahedral Pt74Ag26 alloy nanoparticles has been reported. The as-prepared MoS2-Pt74Ag26 nanohybrids were investigated as novel peroxidase mimics to catalyze the oxidation of classical peroxidase substrate 3,3',5,5'-tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) in the presence of H2O2, producing a blue colored reaction and exhibiting typical Michaelis-Menten kinetics. MoS2-Pt74Ag26 has a higher affinity for H2O2 than horseradish peroxidase (HRP) and a higher v(max) value with TMB as the substrate than MoS2. The improved catalytic activity of hybrids for colorimetric reactions could be attributed to the synergistic effects of octahedral Pt74Ag26 nanoparticles and ultrathin MoS2 nanosheets as supports. Meanwhile, the generation of active oxygen species ((OH)-O-center dot) by H2O2 decomposition with MoS2-Pt74Ag26 was responsible for the oxidation of TMB. On the basis of these findings, a colorimetric method based on MoS2-Pt74Ag26 nanohybrids that is highly sensitive and selective was developed for glucose detection. Lower values of the limit of detection (LOD) were obtained, which is more sensitive than MoS2 nanosheets.									132	7	0	0	37	0	132			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000369908900060	26811962

However,it is greatly restrained the overall efficiency of hydrogen production by the high overpotential of oxygen evolution reaction(OER)and slow reaction kinetics in the traditional water electrolysis. In comparison with OER,urea oxidation reaction(UOR)is an easy process which not only consumes much less energy from hydrogen production,but also degrades urea-rich wastewater. Thus,it is an environmentally friendly technology for hydrogen production from urea electrolysis, which has attracted much attention in recent years. Significant efforts have been made to explore high-effective catalysts due to the UOR with complex process and slow 6e-transfer rate. To improve the UOR performance of Ni-based electrocatalysts,some researchers have devoted to increasing the active sites for electrocatalytic oxidation of urea by controlling the size and morphology of Ni-based catalysts. The surface electron structure can also be changed by incorporation of defect vacancy and unsaturated active site,which is beneficial for UOR. In addition,doping heteroatom is conducive to regulate the electron structure of the catalyst,which can not only change its electrical conductivity,but also induce the conversion of crystal phase or crystal face to improve the intrinsic activity of the catalyst. In recent years,some studies have been dedicated to developing composite catalysts with heterogeneous junction,forming synergistic effect of heterogeneous interface and active phase,which can change the adsorption/desorption of the reactants and promote the electron transfer and electrical conductivity,resulting in enhancing the electrocatalytic UOR performance of Ni-based catalysts. Herein,the design concept and research status of nickel-based UOR catalysts were summarized in recent years,especially in the mechanism of promoting UOR on the Ni-based catalysts through regulating morphology and microstructure,defect engineering,doping modification,and heterojunction. The influence on the electrochemical properties and reaction mechanism of UOR and the synthesis method and structure of Nibased catalysts were also reviewed. Furthermore,in view of the lack of understanding of the relationships of defect-structure-performance,the research direction of rational design of defective nickel-based catalysts was proposed to shed light on further development of urea electrolysis.			将可再生能源发电用于电解水制氢被认为是构筑"氢循环"、缓解能源危机和解决环境问题的理想技术路径之一,然而传统电解水阳极析氧反应(OER)过电位大、反应动力学迟缓,严重制约了电解水制氢的整体效率。而使用更易进行的阳极尿素氧化反应(UOR)取代OER,不仅可以显著降低制氢能耗,还能附带处理富含尿素的废水,在获取清洁氢能源的同时获得环保附加价值,是近年来受到高度关注的一种新型绿色制氢技术。但UOR步骤复杂,6e-转移过程缓慢,故需要高活性催化剂促进其反应速率。在电催化尿素氧化反应中,通过控制镍基催化剂的尺寸、形貌,使其暴露有利于催化尿素氧化分解的活性位点;引入缺陷空位和配位不饱和活性位可改变催化剂表面的电子构型,丰富催化活性位点;掺杂其他元素调控催化剂的电子结构,不仅能改变催化剂的导电性,提升其电子传导能力,还可以诱导晶相或晶面发生变化,提高催化剂的本征活性;构建具有异质结的复合催化剂,利用异质界面与活性相的协同作用,改变反应物的吸/脱附能力,促进其电子转移和传导,从而增强镍基催化剂催化UOR的性能。基于此,本文总结了近几年镍基UOR催化剂的设计理念和最新研究现状,重点阐述了构筑不同形貌尺寸、缺陷工程、掺杂改性、异质结活性界面的镍基催化剂促进UOR的作用机制,对镍基催化剂的合成方法和结构、电化学性能及反应机制进行了概括。此外,针对现有研究对缺陷-结构-性能关系认识的不足,提出了理性设计缺陷镍基催化剂的发展方向,为高效尿素氧化催化剂的开发提供参考。						0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1005-023X			CSCD:7217130

In the last decade, microwave methods have emerged in rapid and effective preparations of 2DMs for catalysis. Microwave heating offers several advantages namely direct, fast, selective heating and uniform reaction temperature compared to conventional heating methods, thus bringing about high-yield and high-purity products in minutes or even seconds. This review summarizes recent advances in microwave-assisted preparations of 2DMs-based catalysts and their state-of-the-art catalytic performances. Microwave heating mechanisms are briefly introduced mainly focusing on microwave-matter interactions, which can guide the choice of precursors, liquid media, substrates, auxiliaries and experiment parameters during microwave radiation. We especially provide a detailed insight into various microwave-assisted procedures, classified as exfoliation, synthesis, doping, modification and construction towards different 2DMs nanomaterials. We also discuss how microwave affects the synthetic composition and microstructure of 2DMs-based catalysts, thereby deeply influencing their optical and electronic properties and the catalytic performances. Finally, advantages, challenges and prospects of microwave-assisted approaches for 2DMs nanomaterials are summarized to inspire the effective and large-scale fabrication of novel 2DMs-based catalysts.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0957-4484	1361-6528		WOS:000807768900001	35508114

Here, the unsaturated Fe sites through the metal-organic framework (MOFs) structure promote the kinetics of water oxidation over TiO2 are successfully in situ decorated. This heterostructure further helps us to better understand the PEC behaviors of organic-inorganic hybrid systems. MIL-100(Fe), as the typical MOFs model, is facilely achieved by an FeOOH sacrificial template method, a strategy which could anchor the compact and ultrathin MIL-100(Fe) films on the surface of TiO2 to obtain abundant unsaturated Fe sites. The photocurrent density of MIL-100(Fe)/TiO2 reaches about 2.4 times at 1.23 V vs reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) compared with bare TiO2, and the incident photon to current conversion efficiency value increases up to 47% (at 390 nm). Furthermore, the photocurrent density of MIL-100(Fe)/TiO2 is maintained at 84% after 3 h, showing that the organic component of MIL-100(Fe) takes a nature of favorable stability. The configuration of MIL-100(Fe)/TiO2 will bring a new insight for learning the basic function of unsaturated metal sites in the PEC system.									19	0	0	0	3	0	19			2194-4288	2194-4296		WOS:000474642200017

In alkaline media, the as-obtained FeNi2Co2 LDH shows superior electrocatalytic activity toward water oxidation with an overpotential of 232 mV at 10 mA/cm(2) and a low Tafel slope of 48 mV/dec, comparable to most of the reported noble-metal free OER catalysts. The suitable electronic structures as well as reduced charge transfer resistance that promote the electrons transfer during the OER process are proposed to be the two critical factors that lower the overpotential of the catalytic reaction.

Single-atom site catalysts (SACs) with monometal-center as the quintessential ADMCs have been extensively studied in the catalysis-related fields. Beyond SACs, novel atomically dispersed metal catalysts (NADMCs) with flexible active sites featuring two or more catalytically centers including dual-atom and triple-atom catalysts have drawn ever-increasing attention recently. Owing to the presence of multiple neighboring active sites, NADMCs could exhibit much higher activity and selectivity compared with SACs, especially in those complicated reactions with multi-step intermediates. This review comprehensively outlines the recent exciting advances on the NADMCs with emphasis on the deeper understanding of the synergistic interactions among multiple metal atoms and underlying structure-performance relationships. It starts with the systematical introduction of principal synthetic approaches for NADMCs highlighting the key issues of each fabrication method including the atomically precise control in the design of metal nuclearity, and then the state-of-the-art characterizations for identifying and monitoring the atomic structure of NADMCs are explored. Thereafter, the recent development of NADMCs in energy-related applications is systematically discussed. Finally, we provide some new insights into the remaining challenges and opportunities for the development of NADMCs.									34	0	0	0	1	0	34			1998-0124	1998-0000		WOS:000805729000004

This study reports a novel one-pot method to fabricate AgPt nano-pompons (AgPt NPs) with the guidance of N-GQDs through AA reduce the precursor of Ag and Pt. Morphology characterization describes N-GQDs as morphology guiding and dispersing agents to regulate the dendrite formation of nano-pompons. Under the optimized conditions, the AgPt NPs (Ag1Pt2) display above 11 times improve-ment in electrocatalytic activity and higher stability for the MOR compared with Pt/C catalysts. Density function theory (DFT) studies prove that the introduction of Ag can greatly enhance the adsorption of CO on Pt and promote the transformation of CO to COOH. The facile synthetic method and excellent MOR performance endow AgPt NPs with great application prospect in DMFCs as an anode catalyst.(C) 2022 The Korean Society of Industrial and Engineering Chemistry.

In the past four decades, many inorganic semiconductor photocatalysts have been studied for this purpose. In recent years, conjugated polymers, in particular covalent carbon nitride frameworks, have rapidly emerged as a new family of photocatalysts. However, the use of conjugated photocatalysts in overall water splitting in the absence of sacrificial agents has been much less reported. Herein, we used surface kinetic control to photocatalyze overall water splitting by a covalent carbon nitride semiconductor with a crystalline poly(triazine imide) (PTI) frameworks. Our study demonstrates that the loading of a Pt co-catalyst on the PTI surface plays the key role in inducing overall water splitting. The co-deposition of a cobalt species can effectively increase the photocatalytic activity and adjust the ratio of H-2 and O-2 produced, as well as enhancing the stability of the photocatalyst. The optimal sample with the dual co-catalysts shows an apparent quantum yield of 2.1% for the overall water splitting reaction.									133	9	0	0	2	0	134			2041-6520	2041-6539		WOS:000406103100031	28970930

In order to endow nanotubes with multifunctionality, rationally designed and fabricated nanotube arrays with controllable structures are highly desired, but still remain a great challenge. Herein, we report a facile synthesis strategy for core-branched CoSe2/Ni0.85Se nanotube arrays directly on Ni foam by simply selenizing Co-precursor nanowires for hybrid supercapacitors. This structure design could not only ensure the intimate contact of self-branched heterostructures, but also offer sufficient active sites for electrochemical reactions. Further, we propose an electrochemical activation strategy to fully boost the electrochemical performance of CoSe2/Ni0.85Se nanotube arrays. After electrochemical activation, CoSe2/Ni0.85Se nanotube arrays have been changed into porous CoOOH/NiOOH, accounting for the remarkable performance. Contributed to by short ion diffusion paths, large electroactive sites and low contact resistance, the CoSe2/Ni0.85Se electrode after electrochemical activation shows remarkable performance for hybrid supercapacitors.									139	5	0	0	10	0	139			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000448412000044

In an analogous process to the naturally occurring enzymatic mechanism, synthesis of ammonia could be achieved in an electrochemical cell, in which electricity would be used to reduce atmospheric nitrogen and water into ammonia at ambient conditions. To date, such a process has not been realized due to slow kinetics and low faradaic efficiencies. Although progress has been made in this regard, at present there exists no device that can produce ammonia efficiently from air and water at room temperature and ambient pressure. In this work, a scheme is presented in which electronic structure calculations are used to screen for catalysts that are stable, active and selective towards N-2 electro-reduction to ammonia, while at the same time suppressing the competing H-2 evolution reaction. The scheme is applied to transition metal nitride catalysts. The most promising candidates are the (100) facets of the rocksalt structures of VN and ZrN, which show promise of producing ammonia in high yield at low onset potentials.									180	12	0	0	6	0	187			1463-9076	1463-9084		WOS:000349616400012	25446373

The inevitable defect sites in architectures greatly affect physicochemical properties of carbon nanomaterials, thus defect engineering has recently become a vital research orientation of carbon-based electrocatalysts. The intentionally introduced intrinsic carbon defect sites in the frameworks can directly serve as the potential active sites owing to the altered surface charge state, modulated adsorption free energy of key intermediates, as well as diminished bandgap. Furthermore, the synergistic sites between intrinsic defects and heteroatom dopants/captured atomic metal species can further optimize the electronic structure and adsorption/desorption behavior, making carbon-based catalysts comparable to commercial precious metal catalysts in electrocatalysis. With pressing research demands, the common configurations, construction strategies, structure-activity relationships, and characterization methods for intrinsic carbon defect-involved catalytic centers are systematically summarized. Such theoretical and experimental evidences of intrinsic defect-induced activity can reveal the active centers and relevant catalytic mechanism, thereby providing necessary guidance for the design and construction of highly efficient carbon-based electrocatalysts and promoting their commercial applications.									154	11	0	0	9	0	156			1616-301X	1616-3028		WOS:000523197200001

However, efficient capture of visible-near-infrared (NIR) photons, especially for those with wavelengths longer than 600 nm, is a demanding quest in photocatalysis owing to their relatively low energy. In recent years, benefiting from the advances in photoactive material design, photocatalytic reaction system optimization, and new emerging mechanisms for long-wavelength photon activation, increasing numbers of studies on the harnessing of visible-NIR light for solar-to-chemical energy conversion have been reported. Here, the aim is to comprehensively summarize the progress in this area. The main strategies of the long-wavelength visible-NIR photon capture and the explicitly engineered material systems, i.e., narrow optical gap, photosensitizers, upconversion, and photothermal materials, are elaborated. In addition, the advances in long-wavelength light-driven photo- and photothermal-catalytic environmental remediation and fuel production are discussed. It is anticipated that this review presents the forefront achievements in visible-NIR photon capture and at the same time promotes the development of novel visible-NIR photon harnessing catalysts toward efficient solar energy utilization.									209	11	0	0	25	0	209			0935-9648	1521-4095		WOS:000450371900011	30133029

The nature and overpotential of the anodic reaction determine the operation costs of an ICCP system so that proper anode selection is critically important for an ICCP system to function efficiently. Commercial anodes based on titanium substrates coated with iridium-tantalum oxide mixtures (IrO2-Ta2O5/Ti) are frequently used for this purpose due to low operating overpotentials. However, the gradual passivation of its surface limits its useful life and increases its operating costs, so it is necessary to seek competitive alternatives for its replacement. This study aimed to determine the feasibility of using carbon steel substrates coated with nickel/cobalt/boron (NiCoB/CS) as a viable low-cost alternative to replace IrO2-Ta2O5/Ti anodes in ICCP systems. Comparison between the electrochemical behavior and the corrosion resistance of both types of electrodes shows that the NiCoB/CS anode shows a good electrocatalytic activity and a higher corrosion resistance than IrO2-Ta2O5/Ti coated anodes, indicating that the NiCoB/CS anodes are promising low-cost candidates for ICCP systems.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3				2079-6412		WOS:000524211800004

The effect of amount of the exposed Pt (controlled either by metal loading or by the catalyst weight) on the catalytic performances for lean-burn deNO(x) reaction was taken firstly under investigation. An optimum peak NOx conversion of 56% was observed at 250 degrees C. Typically, the propylene conversion level was in the 85-100% range at peak NOx conversions. The catalytic data free of transport effects have been identified and then used to calculate kinetic parameters for NO and C3H6 conversions (turnover frequencies and activation energies). The average TOF values for NO and C3H6 conversions, determined in the 225-275 degrees C temperature domain, ranged between 0.04-0.27 and 0.05-0.50 s(-1), respectively. The average activation energies for NO and C3H6 conversions were 91 and 108 kJ mol(-1), respectively. The structure sensitivity of NO/O-2/C3H6 reaction as well as the morphological evolution of the well-structured platinum nanocrystals in reaction conditions have been clearly evidenced. The deNO(x) catalytic behavior was mainly related to the shape (facet effect) and to a lesser extent to the size (bulk effect) of the Pt nanoparticles. The N-2/N2O ratio was higher (approximate to 1: 1) for the catalyst statistically rich in Pt nanoparticles with low index facets, relatively free of defects, compared to the polycrystalline one (approximate to 1:2). High concentration of edges, corners, kinks, and surface defects of polycrystalline platinum particles was the main factor responsible for the overall catalytic activity for NOx conversion. Large (24 nm) as well as small (2.4 nm) polycrystalline Pt particles showed in great lines the same catalytic behavior for NO conversion. In light of experimental results, it is suggested that further improvement in the catalytic activity and selectivity for lean deNO(x) reaction (increase in the specific catalytic activity and N-2/N2O ratio) can be foreseen through an optimum morphological (size and facet) control of the supported Pt particles.

A non-linear change in structure, conductivity, magnetic properties and thermochemical stability of solid solutions was observed with the increase in the Ni/Fe content. A new phase (100 - x) LSM center dot xLNF with orthorhombic symmetry was found in the concentration range 35 <= x < 70 mol%, and exhibits the lowest value of the conductivity and the highest activation energy in the single-phase concentration range 43 <= x <= 53. This is, most probably, caused by a low concentration of Mn3+-O-Mn4+ units available for small polaron motion through the B sublattice. The compositions containing more than 50 mol% Ni in the B sublattice shows metallic-like conductivity behaviour. The temperature of the semiconducting metallic transition decreases with increase in the Ni concentration. All compositions had good thermochemical stability in air, in contrast to that under reducing conditions. The higher the Ni/Fe content in the sample, the faster the reduction of the solid solutions occurred in non-humidified Ar-H-2 (95 : 5) atmosphere. The overall oxygen stoichiometry of the solid solutions is discussed.									23	1	0	0	0	0	24			0959-9428	1364-5501		WOS:000260226900016

Combustion of Flat Shaped Char Particles With Oxygen								JOURNAL OF ENERGY RESOURCES TECHNOLOGY-TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASME				144	2					022302	10.1115/1.4050907				FEB 1 2022	2022	Thin flat-shaped carbon black particles of 1.5 mm thickness by 22.5 mm diameter were combusted in pure oxygen at atmospheric pressures and temperatures in the range of 500-650 degrees C. One-film kinetic-diffusion model was derived to characterize the kinetic and energy parameters for particles arranged in the form of a thin flat-shaped configuration. The kinetic and energy parameters, and operating regimes of thin flat-shaped char particles were characterized during the nonisothermal combustion process. The gasification regimes during preheating were also analyzed. Steady-state energy processes were considered to derive an energy conservation equation used for calculating the evolution of char surface temperatures as well as released peak energy rates and the specific energy, which are considered key engineering design parameters. The one-film kinetic-diffusion model showed that combustion of such particles was purely kinetic controlled under these conditions. The activation energy obtained varied between 50 and 74 kJ/mol using discrete time and linear fits to the Arrhenius equation. The total energies released per weight of char converted varied between 32.8 and 40.6 kJ/g. The highest peak energy rate released was 134 J/s when combusting char in O-2 at a reactor temperature of 504 degrees C.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0195-0738	1528-8994		WOS:000731151500015

X-ray diffraction patterns demonstrated that the position of (002) peaks shift to a slightly higher angle with increasing RTA temperature. The optical bandgap was detected to decrease from 3.36 eV for as-grown sample to 3.27 eV for 600 degrees C-annealed ZnO:Cu film. Moreover, the observed degradation of conductivity with the narrowing of the bandgap for the ZnO:Cu films was correlated to the change of hole-killer defects including oxygen vacancy (V-O) and zinc interstitial (Zn-i) under RTA treatment.

The evolution of aquifer systems in these sediments are closely related to the geological history of the area and the groundwater in the Tertiary aquifer system was evolved during various marine transgressions and regressions. Chemical processes such as leaching of salts, cation exchange and chemical reactions under strong reducing environment modified the hydrochemistry of these aquifers. The salinization and freshening processes in the tertiary aquifer system elucidated from hydrogeological, hydro-chemical and stable isotope (H-2 and O-18) studies are documented in this paper. The hydrochemical and isotope studies corroborate with the observations in the earlier study on the flow regime in the coastal aquifers under SIDA assisted coastal hydrology project (CGWB, 1992).									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0016-7622	0974-6889		WOS:000606434500009		
J	Li, Maoqi; Wu, Jian; Shen, Guoliang								Bifunctional PDDA-stabilized beta-Fe2O3 nanoclusters for improved photoelectrocatalytic and magnetic field enhanced photocatalytic applications								CATALYSIS SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY				12	8			2659	2669		10.1039/d2cy00099g		MAR 2022		APR 19 2022	2022	Photocatalytic water splitting for hydrogen production and water pollutant degradation is a frontier topic to solve energy and environmental problems. In particular, applying electric and magnetic fields on photocatalysts is the most promising solution to improve their catalytic activity. In this work, bifunctional catalyst PDDA-coated beta-Fe2O3 nanoclusters (beta-Fe2O3@PDDA) have been successfully synthesized by a simple one-pot method at 200 degrees C. beta-Fe2O3@PDDA exhibits excellent photoelectrocatalytic (PEC) activity for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) with an overpotential of 300 mV, Tafel slope of 45 mV dec(-1) and good catalytic stability. Moreover, beta-Fe2O3@PDDA exhibited a good magnetic field-enhanced photocatalytic (MF-PC) RhB degradation activity under artificial simulated sunlight; the photocatalytic efficiency can be improved by 44% under an external magnetic field than that without a magnetic field. The surface PDDA-coated beta-Fe2O3 can be stably dispersed in water for more than 10 days without agglomeration, which is of great significance for the MF-PC degradation of water pollutants in practical applications. The high catalytic activity for MF-PC is attributed to the magnetic field-suppressed electron-hole recombination and the spin-polarized properties of beta-Fe2O3 in photocatalysis. Our study provides a new strategy for the preparation of highly dispersed beta-Fe2O3 nanoclusters under mild conditions and the development of ultrastable organic/inorganic composite photocatalysts. This opens up a new avenue for developing electric and magnetic field-enhanced photocatalysts for use in clean energy and environmental control.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			2044-4753	2044-4761		WOS:000770088000001

The system Ti-Fe-Ru-O has been explored to some extent. Structural evolution on milling has been followed by x-ray diffraction. After milling, the powder is cold pressed in the form of a circular disc to be used as cathode for the electrochemical synthesis of sodium chlorate. The electrochemical properties (overpotential, chemical inertness and long term stability in the electrolyte) were investigated as a function of the alloy composition. We have measured, for some nanocrystalline alloys, an overpotential 300 mV lower than that of the steel cathodes (eta(250 mA/cm)2 approximate to 900-1000 mV). Steel is the commonly used cathode in this industry. Long term stability has been tested for over 1000 hours on nanocrystalline Ti32Fe20Ru16O32 without showing any visible degradation. This material is also chemically inert with respect to the decomposition of the hypochlorite.

Here, we show that some of the paradigms contradict each other, and that each has serious flaws (contradictions, problems) when they are compared to a variety of observations (geological, mineralogical, or geochemical data from natural samples; laboratory experimental data; results of theoretical studies). In contrast, all of these observations are better explained by the Dimroth-Ohmoto model for Earth's evolution, which postulates that a fully oxygenated atmosphere-ocean system developed by ca. 3.5 Ga.Examination of the available data from natural and experimental systems has also led us to suggest the following: (1) The geochemical cycles of O, Fe, and S (and other redox-sensitive elements) through the atmosphere-ocean-oceanic crust-mantle-continental crust have been basically the same as today since at least ca. 3.5 Ga. (2) The anaerobic and aerobic microbial biospheres, both in the oceans and on land, developed by ca. 3.5 Ga, playing an important role in the geochemical cycles of nutrients and other elements. (3) The geochemistry of sedimentary rocks (shales, carbonates, cherts) has been basically the same since ca. 3.5 Ga. (4) Fe-III oxides in BIFs were formed by reactions between locally discharged Fe2+-and silica-rich submarine hydrothermal fluids and O-2-rich deep seawater. (5) Magnetite in BIFs was formed during high-temperature diagenetic stages of BIFs through reactions between primary goethite or hematite and Fe2+-rich hydrothermal fluids. (6) BIFs were formed throughout geologic history. (7) Sulfidic oceans (i.e., the "Canfield ocean") did not exist during the Proterozoic Eon. However, regional sulfidic seas, like the Black Sea, have existed in globally oxygenated oceans throughout geologic history. (8) The primary carbonate in Archean oceans, as in younger oceans, was Fe-poor calcite.Furthermore, (9) the pre-1.8 Ga atmosphere was CO2 rich with the pCO(2) level greater than similar to 100 present atmospheric level (PAL). CO2 alone provided the greenhouse effect necessary to compensate for the young Sun's lower luminosity. (10) The Archean pH values were 4.0-4.5 for rainwater, between 4.5 and 6.0 for river water, and 7.0 +/- 0.5 for ocean water. The oceans were saturated with calcite but undersaturated with siderite. (11) The delta O-18 of Archean oceans was similar to 0%, as today. (12) Ferich carbonates (siderite, ankerite) have formed during the diagenesis of sediments throughout geologic history by reactions between the primary calcite and Fe2+-rich solutions, either hydrothermal solutions or those derived from biological or abiological dissolution of Fe-III-(hydr)oxides within the sediments.Other suggestions include: (13) The ranges of delta S-34 values of pyrite and sulfates in Archean sedimentary rocks are much larger than those quoted in the literature and comparable to those in Proterozoic sedimentary rocks. (14) Pyrites in organic C-rich black shales associated with BIFs were formed by a reaction between Fe2+-and SO(4)(2-)rich hydrothermal solutions and organic C-rich shales during early diagenetic stages of the host sediments. This reaction also created AIF-S in the pyrite and the residual SO42-. (15) The AIF-S signatures in Archean and younger rocks were not created by the ultraviolet photolysis of volcanic SO2 in a reducing atmosphere. AIF-S signatures are not evidence for a reducing atmosphere. (16) Contrary to a popular belief that AIF-S-forming events ceased at ca. 2.45 Ga, AIF-S was also formed at later geologic times. (17) The presence of AIF-S signatures in some pre-2.4 Ga rocks, but the lower abundance of AIF-S in post-2.4 Ga rocks, may reflect changes in the mantle-crust dynamics, including changes in the thickness and movements of oceanic lithosphere.

These anodizing processes, which aim at preparing the metal surface for adhesive bonding or painting, all lead to the formation of an aluminium oxide layer. A set of aluminium samples representing the various steps of the processes was analysed by XPS. After curve fitting of the aluminium peak (Al 2p) and oxygen peak (O 1s) recorded at high energy resolution, and correction of charging effects, residual energy shifts between the spectra can be observed. This could be attributed to differences in the Fermi energy values between the treated aluminium surfaces. A classification based on this parameter of the relative Lewis acid-base character of these treated surfaces is proposed, The evolution of this parameter after exposure of the treated samples to a moist environment was also studied.									30	2	0	0	0	0	32			0142-2421			WOS:A1995RN88000004

In this study, scanning electrochemical cell microscopy (SECCM) is applied in tandem with co-located electron backscattered diffraction (EBSD) to give a holistic view of the relationship between the surface structure and the electrochemical activity and corrosion susceptibility of polycrystalline Cu. An unusual aqueous nanodroplet/oil (dodecane)/metal three-phase configuration is employed, which opens up new prospects for fundamental studies of multiphase electrochemical systems, and mimics the environment of corrosion in certain industrial and automotive applications. In this configuration, the nanodroplet formed at the end of the SECCM probe (nanopipette) is surrounded by dodecane, which acts as a reservoir for oil-soluble species (e.g., O-2) and can give rise to enhanced flux(es) across the immiscible liquid-liquid interface, as shown by finite element method (FEM) simulations. This unique three-phase configuration is used to fingerprint nanoscale corrosion in a nanodroplet cell, and to analyse the interrelationship between the Cu oxidation, Cu2+ deposition and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) processes, together with nanoscale open circuit (corrosion) potential, in a grain-by-grain manner. Complex patterns of surface reactivity highlight the important role of grains of high-index orientation and microscopic surface defects (e.g., microscratches) in modulating the corrosion-properties of polycrystalline Cu. This work provides a roadmap for in-depth surface structure-function studies in (electro)materials science and highlights how small variations in surface structure (e.g., crystallographic orientation) can give rise to large differences in nanoscale reactivity.									12	0	0	0	0	0	11			2041-6520	2041-6539		WOS:000625958900035	34164075

Geochemical H-2 stems from serpentinization, a process in which rock-bound iron reduces water to H-2. Reactions involving H-2 and carbon dioxide (CO2) in hydrothermal systems generate abiotic methane and formate; these reactions resemble the core energy metabolism of methanogens and acetogens. These organisms are strict anaerobic autotrophs that inhabit hydrothermal vents and harness energy via H-2-dependent CO2 reduction. Serpentinization also generates native metals, which can reduce CO2 to formate and acetate in the laboratory. The enzymes that channel H-2, CO2, and dinitrogen (N-2) into methanogen and acetogen metabolism are the backbone of the most ancient metabolic pathways. Their active sites share carbon-metal bonds which, although rare in biology, are conserved relics of primordial biochemistry present at the origin of life.									11	0	0	0	10	0	11			0968-0004	1362-4326		WOS:000481589900008	31104860

In a series of experiments, we investigated the growth of Li2O2 upon discharge and the corresponding reduction and oxidation processes by varying the depth of discharge. The results indicate that insulating Li2O2 particles with a disc-like shape were formed during the initial discharge stage. Afterward, the nucleation and growth of Li2O2 resulted in the formation of conducting Li2O2 shells. When the discharge voltage dropped below 2.65 V, the Li2O2 discs evolved to toroid-shaped particles and defective superoxide-like phase presumably with high conductivity was formed on the rims of Li2O2 toroids. Both Li2O2 and the superoxide-like phase are unstable in ether-based electrolytes resulting in the degradation of the corresponding cells. Nevertheless, by controlling the growth of Li2O2, the chemical reactivity of the discharge product can be suppressed to improve the reversibility of Li-O-2 batteries.									114	2	0	0	8	0	114			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000340446300035	25006701

Myriad investigations have been performed to understand the morphological response to the involved gases. However, most prior work is limited to low pressures, which is far beyond realistic conditions. A dynamic morphological evolution of palladium-copper (PdCu) NC within a nano-reactor is reported, with atmospheric pressure hydrogen at the atomic scale. In situ transmission electron microscopy (TEM) videos reveal that spherical PdCu particles transform into truncated cubes at high hydrogen pressure. First principles calculations demonstrate that the surface energies decline with hydrogen pressure, with a new order of gamma(H-001) < gamma(H-110) < gamma(H-111) at 1 bar. A comprehensive Wulff construction based on the corrected surface energies is perfectly consistent with the experiments. The work provides a microscopic insight into NC behaviors at realistic gas pressure and is promising for the shaping of nanocatalysts by gas-assisted treatments.									56	10	0	0	2	0	59			1433-7851	1521-3773		WOS:000384713700052	27593991

UCs formed at random locations on the grown layer without any apparent relation with the substrate. Their nucleation might be due to contaminants and their development controlled by the growth conditions in the plasma. In contrast, dislocations formed from impurities segregated at the interface between the substrate and the CVD layer, were found to be the origin of the FHs and the PHs. A simple crystal model that involves micro-faceting or twinning at an intrinsic stacking fault originating from the dislocation core is proposed to explain the formation and the evolution of the growth defects.

To achieve high efficiency for practical implementation, it is imperative to understand the regulation for tuning the chemical activity and meanwhile suppressing photocarrier recombination in black phosphorus. Here for the first time, we exploit the typical point defects in phosphorene to activate its basal plane and optimally modulate the photocarrier dynamics for solar-driven nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR). Combining first-principles calculations and time-dependentab initiononadiabatic molecular dynamics simulations, we elucidate the exact influence of each type of defect on the reduction capability and lifetime of photogenerated carriers as well as the NRR activity and selectivity of phosphorene. These results provide essential knowledge for precise design of high-efficiency nonmetal photocatalysts for hydrogen fuel storage at the atomic level.									11	0	0	0	0	0	11			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000578872600029

Here, we report that carbon nanotubes (CNTs), doped with nitrogen to form resident electron-rich defects, can act as highly efficient and, more importantly, stable catalysts for the conversion of CO2 to CO. The unprecedented overpotential (-0.18 V) and selectivity (80%) observed on nitrogen-doped CNTs (NCNTs) are attributed to their unique features to facilitate the reaction, including (i) high electrical conductivity, (ii) preferable catalytic sites (pyridinic N defects), and (iii) low free energy for CO2 activation and high barrier for hydrogen evolution. Indeed, DFT calculations show a low free energy barrier for the potential-limiting step to form key intermediate COOH as well as strong binding energy of adsorbed CON and weak binding energy for the adsorbed CO. The highest selective site toward CO production is pyridinic N, and the NCNT-based electrodes exhibit no degradation over 10 h of continuous operation, suggesting the structural stability of the electrode.									446	27	1	0	26	0	455			1936-0851	1936-086X		WOS:000355383000072	25897553

During the antenatal period, the evaluation of fetal hemodynamic adaptation to hypoxemia and the assessment of its chronological evolution by Doppler technology are crucial. During the intrapartum period, the relative inaccessibility of the fetus and the complexity of the pathophysiology of fetal oxygenation make it difficult to obtain and interpret information on the fetal response to labor stress. Due to the limitations of cardiotocography, additional information is required for appropriate decision making during labor. Current evidence suggests that modern technology applied to fetal surveillance can provide useful additional information that can improve our capacity to interpret fetal reactions to labor events.

In this study, a simple dip-coating process was used to modify the surface of alpha-Fe2O3 nanorod arrays with cobalt oxide (CoOx) and carbon (C) for the improved PEC performance, with a photocurrent density at 1.6 V (vs. reversible hydrogen electrode, RHE) increased from 0.10 mA/cm(2) for the pristine alpha-Fe2O3 to 0.37 mA/cm2 for the CoOx/C modified alpha-Fe2O3 nanorods. As revealed by electrochemical analysis, thanks to the synergistic effect of CoOx and C, the PEC enhancement could be attributed to the enhanced charge transfer ability, decreased surface charge recombination, and accelerated water oxidation reaction kinetics. This study serves as a good example for improving PEC water splitting performance via a simple method.

This review covers the recent developments in catalysis, water splitting, fuel cells, batteries, supercapacitors, and hydrogen storage enabled by HEMs covering metallic, oxide, and non-oxide alloys. Here, first, the primary rules for the proper selection of the elements and the formation of a favorable single solid solution phase in HEMs are defined. Furthermore, recent developments in different fields of energy conversion and storage achieved by HEMs are discussed. Higher electrocatalytic and catalytic activities with longer cycling stability and durability compared to conventional noble metal-based catalysts are reported for high-entropy materials. In electrochemical energy storage systems, high-entropy oxides and alloys have shown superior performance as anode and cathode materials with long cycling stability and high capacity retention. Also, when used as metal hydrides for hydrogen storage, remarkably high hydrogen storage capacity and structural stability are observed for HEMs. In the end, future directions and new energy-related technologies that can be enabled by the application of HEMs are outlined.									78	5	0	0	1	0	80			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000609149500006

This synthetic approach constitutes a simple, one-step, versatile procedure to grow multifunctional mesoporous layers appealing for diverse applications that take advantage of materials with an ultra-high surface area-to-volume ratio. The films exhibit tuneable composition with relative Fe/Pt weight ratios, disregarding oxygen, varying from 4/96 to 52/48. All the mesoporous alloys show a soft magnetic behaviour with tuneable saturation magnetization and coercivity values (the latter ranging from ca. 5 Oe to 40 Oe). In addition, the Au/Fe-Pt deposits (even the ones with higher Fe content) exhibit good performance towards hydrogen evolution reaction in both alkaline and acidic media due to the inherent mesoporosity, with excellent stability after running 50 cycles. The interest of alloying Fe with Pt is thus two-fold: (i) to confer magnetic properties to the mesoporous alloys and (ii) to reduce the amount of the costly noble metal in the electrocatalyst in an environmentally sustainable manner.									16	0	0	0	0	0	16			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000416825000052	29134999

Here the authors report a water-promoted surface restructuring process to enhance the performance of Ba0.9Co0.7Fe0.2Nb0.1O3-delta air electrode.Reversible protonic ceramic electrochemical cells (R-PCECs) are ideally suited for efficient energy storage and conversion; however, one of the limiting factors to high performance is the poor stability and insufficient electrocatalytic activity for oxygen reduction and evolution of the air electrode exposed to the high concentration of steam. Here we report our findings in enhancing the electrochemical activity and durability of a perovskite-type air electrode, Ba0.9Co0.7Fe0.2Nb0.1O3-delta (BCFN), via a water-promoted surface restructuring process. Under properly-controlled operating conditions, the BCFN electrode is naturally restructured to an Nb-rich BCFN electrode covered with Nb-deficient BCFN nanoparticles. When used as the air electrode for a fuel-electrode-supported R-PCEC, good performances are demonstrated at 650 degrees C, achieving a peak power density of 1.70 W cm(-2) in the fuel cell mode and a current density of 2.8 A cm(-2) at 1.3 V in the electrolysis mode while maintaining reasonable Faradaic efficiencies and promising durability.									10	0	0	0	0	0	9				2041-1723		WOS:000785774400009	35459865

Significant improvement on both CO2 reduction and water splitting was attained compared with those for non-supported Ga2O3 and La2O3. The improvement is attributed to the transformation of the La2O3 surface to NaLa(CO3)(2) during the photocatalytic reduction tests in aqueous solution of NaHCO3. NaLa(CO3)(2) was preferentially formed on the surface of La2O3 without changing Ga2O3 resulting in the structure of Ga2O3 supported by NaLa(CO3)(2). Once NaLa(CO3)(2) fully covered the surface of La2O3, the high catalytic activity was kept long.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1348-0391			WOS:000522787800001

Here we elucidate the effects of subducted components on magma sources along different sections of the Aeolian Arc by evaluating systematics of elements depleted in the upper mantle but enriched in the subducting slab, focusing on a new set of B, Be, As, and Li measurements. Based on our new results, we suggest that both hydrous fluids and silicate melts were involved in element transport from the subducting slab to the mantle wedge. Hydrous fluids strongly influence the chemical composition of lavas in the central arc (Salina) while a melt component from subducted sediments probably plays a key role in metasomatic reactions in the mantle wedge below the peripheral islands (Stromboli). We also noted similarities in subducting components between the Aeolian Archipelago, the Phlegrean Fields, and other volcanic arcs/arc segments around the world (e.g., Sunda, Cascades, Mexican Volcanic Belt). We suggest that the presence of melt components in all these locations resulted from an increase in the mantle wedge temperature by inflow of hot asthenospheric material from tears/windows in the slab or from around the edges of the sinking slab.									29	5	0	0	0	0	32				1525-2027		WOS:000380728300005

In this study, we show that the photocatalytic activity for water oxidation can be better improved by the synergistic effect on electronic structures, including the N ratio change and heteroatom doping. Pristine g-C3N4 presents poor OER activity due to strong binding with the intermediates of *OH and *O, which can be weakened significantly by reducing the ratio of N in g-C3N3 and g-C2N. Furthermore, binding with all the intermediates during the OER process can be further modulated by heteroatom doping. In particular, low overpotentials of 0.37 V and 0.38 V are obtained on S-doped g-C3N3 and g-C2N, respectively. More importantly, the introduced impurity bands by S-doping can effectively trap the photo-generated holes for water oxidation and thus improve the photocatalytic efficiency, which is demonstrated by the nonadiabatic molecular dynamics simulations. Besides, other characteristics for photocatalysts, including band edges, light absorbance, thermal stability and so on, are also evaluated. The systematic study provides insight into modulation mechanisms for electronic structures by commonly applied approaches in experiments and guidance on the performance optimization of carbon nitride based metal-free photocatalysts.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000647139100001

However, due to the difficulty of decomposition of Li2O2, Li-O-2 batteries have high charge overpotential and poor cycling life. So all kinds of catalysts have been studied on the cathode. Compared to heterogeneous solid catalysts, soluble catalysts achieve faster and more effective transport of electrons by reversible redox pairs. Here, we first report ruthenocene (Ruc) as a mobile redox mediator in a Li-O-2 battery. 0.01 mol/L Ruc in the electrolyte effectively reduces the charging voltage by 610 mV. Additionally, Ruc greatly increases the cycling life by four-fold (up to 83 cycles) with a simple ketjen black (KB) cathode. The results of SEM, XPS and XRD confirm that less discharge product residue accumulated after recharge. To verify the reaction mechanisms of the mediator, free energy profiles of the possible reaction pathways based on DFT are provided.

The iridium solution was obtained by reaction of the sodium hexachloroiridate(IV) precursor in the presence of sodium ethoxide in ethanol. Gels were formed in all but the high-Ir samples. Analysis of the dried gels showed minority-phase enrichment at the surface and the presence of Ir(III), while microscopy showed evidence for dispersed iridium-containing nanoparticles (1-20 nm in diameter). XRD powder patterns of the calcined material showed peaks due to a small amount of crystalline NaCl impurity which could be removed by washing. This left amorphous phases, except in the Ir:Ti 3:2 case, which showed evidence for the presence of separate crystalline oxide phases: anatase, IrO2 and Ti (x) Ir1-x O-2.									17	1	0	0	0	0	17			0928-0707	1573-4846		WOS:000250626500007

Macrae/0000-0002-7452-2827			A reaction-diffusion model for grayscale digital light processing 3D printing								EXTREME MECHANICS LETTERS				53						101714	10.1016/j.eml.2022.101714				MAY 2022	2022	Digital light processing (DLP) 3D printing is an additive manufacturing process that utilizes light patterns to photopolymerize a liquid resin into a solid. Due to the accuracy of modern digital micromirror devices (DMD) and recent advances in resin chemistry, it is now possible to create functionally graded structures using different light intensity values, also known as grayscale DLP (g-DLP). Different intensities of light lead to differences in the polymer crosslinking density after curing, which ultimately produces a part with gradients of material properties. However, g-DLP is a complicated process. First, the DLP printing is a highly coupled chemical and physical process that involves light propagation, chemical reactions, species diffusion, heat transfer, volume shrinkage, and changes in mechanical behaviors of the curing resin. Second, in g-DLP, light gradients create strong in plane gradients of chemical species concentrations in the curing liquid resin due to the strong dependence of light intensity on the rate of monomer crosslinking. Furthermore, light gradients through the depth create concentration gradients due to the degree of cure dependent light absorption and the use of photoabsorbers. These complex physical features of the printing process must be understood in order to properly control printing parameters such as light exposure time, printing speed, and grayscale variations to achieve accurate mechanical properties. In this paper, a photopolymerization reaction-diffusion model is developed and used in conjunction with experiments to investigate the coupled effects of light propagation, chemical reaction rates, and species diffusion during g-DLP 3D printing. The model is implemented numerically utilizing the finite difference method and simulation results are compared to experimental findings of simple printed structures. The agreement between experimental and model predictions of simple quantities of interest, such as geometric feature sizes, shows that the model can capture the overcure due to free-radical and other species diffusion during printing when grayscale patterns are employed. This model lays the groundwork for future extensions that can incorporate more complex coupled physics such as heat transfer, volume shrinkage, and material property evolution, which are critically important in utilizing g-DLP 3D printing for the fabrication of high-performance parts which excellent geometric and material property tolerances.

It is difficult to directly obtain the matching characteristics of thermal cracking behavior of coal and oil during the reaction,and not conducive to distinguish the interaction between different components.The pyrolysis and co-pyrolysis characteristics of a low metamorphic coal and a fluid catalytic cracking slurry (FCC) at different blending ratios were studied via thermogravimetry coupled with mass spectrometry.The intrinsic thermal reactions between the co-processing of coal and FCC was investigated by comparing the experimental and theoretical values.The results showed that the initial,peak and final pyrolysis temperature of the FCC are much lower than that of the coal,and the volatile content is significantly higher than the coal sample.At the initial stage of the reaction (200-400 ℃),the co-pyrolysis curves of coal and FCC is obviously shifted to a lower temperature region, indicating that synergetic effect exists during the co-pyrolysis of the coal and the FCC.When the reaction temperature is higher than 400 ℃,most of the FCC has volatilized, there is no obvious synergetic effect.Combined with online mass spectrometry data, the peaks of CO_2 and CO was found in the pyrolysis temperature region of the FCC,at which mainly the FCC pyrolysis.It could be deduced to the solvent effect or the active metal contained in the FCC,which catalyzed the breaking of ether bond,hydroxyl or oxygen-containing molecule in coal.No interaction was observed during the co-pyrolysis of the coal ash and the FCC,while synergetic effect was observed during the co-pyrolysis of the FCC and the demineralized coal at 200-400 ℃,which further verifies the above deduction.			煤油共炼改变了单一的煤炭直接液化和重油加氢裂化加工模式,降低了煤液化的操作难度,开辟了煤直接液化和重油轻质化的新途径,为推动煤炭和重油高效清洁转化、保障国家能源安全提供了技术支撑。然而煤油共炼常在高压、催化、加氢的条件下进行,难以直接获得共转化过程中煤和共炼油热裂解行为匹配特性,也不利于区分不同组分间的相互作用。选取一种低变质烟煤和一种催化裂化油浆(FCC油浆)为原料,利用热重-质谱联用技术研究了煤与FCC油浆单独热解和不同掺混比例下共热解的反应特性,探讨了煤和油浆本征热解的匹配性。结果表明,FCC油浆热解的起始温度,峰值温度和结束温度要远低于煤样,其产生的挥发分量则明显高于煤样。共热解实验曲线与计算反应曲线分析发现,反应初始阶段(200 ~ 400 ℃),煤样与油浆混合样品的热解曲线明显向低温区偏移,表明该阶段煤与FCC油浆共热解反应有协同作用,但当反应温度大于400 ℃后,由于此时大部分FCC油浆已经挥发,生成的残焦与煤共热解没有明显的相互作用。结合在线质谱,发现在FCC油浆热解温区,出现煤热解反应产生的CO_2和CO气体逸出峰,分析可能是由于FCC油浆的溶剂效应,或是其含有的活性金属,使煤中的部分醚键、羟基或含氧杂环分子发生了断键反应。通过煤灰与FCC油浆共热解没有相互作用、而FCC油浆对脱灰煤在低温区(200 ~ 400 ℃)的热解有一定促进作用,进一步验证了上述结论。						2	0	0	0	0	0	2			0253-9993			CSCD:7038568

The [WO6] octahedra were found to be connected to each other by corner and edge sharing in the crystalline Li2W2O7 and K2W2O7 compounds. In the crystal lattice of Na2W2O7, on the other hand, the [WO4] tetrahedra and [WO6] octahedra were found to coexist and paired by corner sharing. Although the structural diversity has clearly led to distinct Raman spectra of the crystalline A(2)W(2)O(7) compounds, the spectra of their melts tended to be analogous, showing the typical vibration modes of (W2O7)(2-) dimer. A mechanism was then proposed to explain the structure evolution occurring during the melting process of A(2)W(2)O(7). The effect of A(+) cation on the Raman bands of (W2O7)(2-) dimer in molten A(2)W(2)O(7) has also been investigated. Both the wavenumber and full width at half-height (FWHH) of the characteristic band assigned to the symmetrical stretching vibration mode of W-O-nb (non-bridging oxygen) in (W2O7)(2-) were found to decrease in the sequence of Li+, Na+ and K+, indicating the cation effect on the mean bond length and its distribution range of W-O-nb. In addition, the relative intensity of this band was also influenced by the cation and it was increased in the order of Li2W2O7, Na2W2O7 and K2W2O7, which has been explained by the charge transfer process and confirmed by Mulliken overlap population analysis.

Complexes of first-row transition metals have attracted great attention in the last decade due to their pronounced catalytic efficiency in water oxidation, comparable to that exhibited by classical platinum-group metal complexes. Cobalt, being an abundant and relatively cheap metal, has rich coordination chemistry allowing construction of a wide range of polynuclear architectures for the catalytic purposes. This review covers recent advances in application of cobalt complexes as (pre) catalysts for water oxidation in the model catalytic system comprising [Ru(bpy)3](2+) as a photosensitizer and S2O82- as a sacrificial electron acceptor. The catalytic parameters are summarized and discussed in view of the structures of the catalysts. Special attention is paid to the degradation of molecular catalysts under catalytic conditions and the experimental methods and techniques used to control their degradation as well as the leaching of cobalt ions.									23	1	0	0	1	0	23			2073-4344			WOS:000454711500034		
J	Lan, Bang; Xiang, Yi; Luo, Xiaohu; Wu, Dawang; Zhang, Lei; Duan, Jingjing; Guo, Meng; Ito, Yorhukaaze; Liu, Yali								Charge regulation engineering to suppress Jahn-Teller distortion in low crystallinity In-doping MnCo2O4 for high activity pseudocapacitors and hydrogen evolution reaction								CHEMICAL ENGINEERING JOURNAL				430						132886	10.1016/j.cej.2021.132886		OCT 2021		FEB 15 2022	2022	Jahn-Teller distortion in the transition metal oxides (TMOs) could cause the poor activity and stability in the potentially promising materials for the supercapacitor and electrocatalyst. Herein, a novel strategy to address this problem by a charge regulation engineering is provided, in which, the Jahn-Teller distortion in the low crystallinity In-doped MnCo2O4 (In/MnCo2O4) in-situ grown on the Nickel foam (NF) (In/MnCo2O4-NF) by a simple laser-assisted method is significantly reduced. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and X-ray absorption near-edge spectrum (XANES) analyses show that the strong electronic interaction between the doped In and Mn/Co suppresses Jahn-Teller distortion of Mn3+ and Co3+ cations in the In/MnCo2O4. Moreover, density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that the enhanced electrochemical activity and the effects of suppressed Jahn-Teller distortion. As a result, In/MnCo2O4-NF material shows a highly supercapacitive performance with a high specific capacitance of 1436.8F g(-1) at a current density of 1 A g(-1), a high rate capability of 71.9% of the capacitance retention at 20 A g(-1), and a superior cycle stability (90.1% of the specific capacitance retention after 16,000 cycles). When being paired with activated carbon, the quasi-solid-state asymmetric supercapacitor provides a maximum energy density of 61.5 Wh kg(-1) at a power density of 963.2 W kg(-1) and an ultra-long cycling lifespan (84.6% retention after 120,000 cycles at 10 A g(-1)). Furthermore, In/MnCo2O4-NF as an electrocatalyst has a high hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) performance with a low overpotential (61.8 mV) and a small Tafel slope (76 mV dec(-1)).									7	0	0	0	1	0	7			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000723497800001

A 4C (monoclinic) pyrrhotite [Fe7S8, Ni: Fe substitution of about 1: 200] in a low sulfide waste rock was weathered in the laboratory and at a field site to identify the evolution of S oxidation, distribution and coordination of Ni, and possible adsorption of Ni on secondary Fe minerals. Mineral phase S was present in the -2, -1, 0, + 4, and + 6 oxidation states prior to its release as SO42- into solution. The thiosulfate [S2O32-] pathway of sulfide oxidation was indicated by the presence of polythionates and S2O32- Sulfur as S2O32- was more persistent than sulfite [SO32-] prior to oxidation to SO42-. The release of Ni during the oxidative dissolution of pyrrhotite was influenced by its distribution in the grain: diffuse throughout the grain (solid solution mineral) or concentrated in exsolved pentlandite [(Fe, Ni)(9)S-8] lamellae within the pyrrhotite. With the oxidation of S, Ni coordination changed from bonding with reduced S species to bonding with oxygen prior to its release with SO42-. Sulfur as SO42- typically stayed in solutionwith release from the pyrrhotite, but the solubility of released Ni was dependent on leachate pH. A near-neutral pH induced the adsorption of Ni onto Fe (oxyhydr) oxides, which formed during oxidation of the pyrrhotite. In some grains, Ni was found concentrated in Fe distal precipitates as opposed to the closer alteration layers/zones of the sulfide grain. Subsequent dissolution of the Fe (oxyhydr) oxides or desorption of Ni with a change in pH provides a delayed release of Ni into solution. This improved understanding of the oxidation pathway of S, coordination and release of Ni, and influence of Fe (oxyhydr) oxides in the weathering of pyrrhotite will assist in determining appropriate reaction-rate factors and element release rates for prediction of acid rock drainage.

The understanding of the kinetically sluggish alHER exhibited by both Pt and Pt-group-metal-free catalysts is primarily derived from indirect electrochemical parameters such as the Tafel slope. To address these issues, we establish the critical role of a nanocarbon floret (NCF) based electrochemical support in generating a key cobalt-oxohydroxo (OH-CoO) intermediate during the alHER through operando Raman spectro-electrochemistry. Specifically, interfacial nano-engineering of a newly designed carbon support (NCF) with a spinel Co3O4 nanocube catalyst is demonstrated to achieve a facile alHER (-0.46 V@10 mA cm(-2)). Such an efficient alHER is mainly attributed to the unique lamellar morphology with a high mesoporous surface area (936 m(2) g(-1)) of the NCF which catalyses the rate-determining water dissociation step and facilitates rapid ion diffusion. The dissociated water drives the formation of the OH-CoO intermediate, spectroscopically captured for the first time through the emergence of a nu OH-CoO Raman peak (1074 cm(-1)). The subsequent alHER proceeds through the Volmer-Heyrovsky route (119 mV dec(-1)) via the T-d Co2+ <-> Co3+ <-> Co4+ oxidative pathway. Concomitant graphitization of the NCF through the disappearance of nu sp(3)C-H (2946 cm(-1)) supports the co-operative dynamics at the Co3O4-NCF interface. Thus, the NCF positively contributes towards the lowering of the overpotential with a low charge-transfer resistance (R-ct = 35.8 omega) and high double layer capacitance (C-dl = 410 mF cm(-2)).									7	0	0	0	0	0	7			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000476564300032	31290513

However, selection of suitable materials with apposite properties for the same is highly challenging, not to mention the complicated two or more-step preparation routes with binders and templates involved during synthesis process. Herein, we report for the first time on nickel-copper oxide nanocomposite films as bifunctional electrocatalyst for HER/OER prepared using one-step, binder-free, cost-effective, jet nebulizer spray pyrolysis (JNSP) technique. Synergetic performance of NiO and CuO is investigated by varying Cu concentrations in CuxNi1 - xO mixed oxide system. Structural, morphological and chemical composition of the as-prepared CuxNi1 - xO (x = 0, 0.1, 0.2 and 0.5) films were investigated from XRD, FESEM, EDS and XPS studies. Point defects such as oxygen and nickel vacancies that promote charge-transfer electronic conductivity favourable for electrochemical reactions were noted from XPS spectra. Variation in optical band gap and Urbach energy with Cu incorporation in NiO is observed from optical studies, whereas change in electrical parameters is noted from four-probe system. When subjected to electrochemical studies using conventional three-electrode setup, as expected, cubic NiO and monoclinic CuO coexisting as nanocomposite in the same matrix exhibited better HER/OER performance when compared to pristine single-phased cubic NiO.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			0947-7047	1862-0760		WOS:000707286300002

Studies of host-pathogen interactions provide valuable insights into the coevolutionay arms race between fungal pathogens and their hosts. Entomopathogenic fungi have evolved a series of sophisticated strategies to counter insect immune defenses. In response to fungal infection, insect hosts rely on behavior avoidance, physical barrier and innate immune defenses in the fight against invading pathogens. The insect cuticle acts as the first physical barrier against pathogens. It is an inhospitable physiological environment that contains chemicals (e.g., antimicrobial peptides and reactive oxygen species), which inhibit fungal growth. In addition, innate immune responses, including cellular immunity and humoral immunity, play critical roles in preventing fungal infection. In this review, we outline the current state of our knowledge of insect defenses to fungal infection and discuss the strategies by which entomopathogenic fungi counter the host immune system. Increased knowledge regarding the molecular interactions between entomopathogenic fungi and the insect host could provide new strategies for pest management. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

In this study, partially delocalized Co-S-Se ultra-thin nanosheets are obtained via a liquid-liquid interface-mediated strategy at an oil-water interface. These Co-S-Se ultra-thin nanosheets exhibit different-sized lamellar structures and have an average thickness of 0.83 nm. The ternary ultra-thin Co0.45S0.38Se0.17 nanosheets demonstrate excellent performance for the OER, accompanied by an overpotential of 290 mV (1.52 V vs. RHE) at 10 mA cm(-2), and a Tafel slope of 74.5 mV dec(-1). In the meantime, the catalyst recombined with a stoichiometry NiOx catalyst to form a composite interface, which also exhibited a good OER performance, with an overpotential of 260 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) and a smaller Tafel slope of 53.9 mV dec(-1). The nanosheets can rearrange the electronic density near the metal catalytic centers and increase the electron transfer. DFT calculations indicate that the partially delocalized charges can improve electrocatalytic performances, demonstrating modulated electroreduction properties. Due to the special atomic and electronic structure of the ternary transition metal alloy chalcogenide, the compound has great potential for energy storage, which will help in the rational design and synthesis of high-efficiency electrocatalysts.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			1463-9076	1463-9084		WOS:000789986600001	35506176

The pathways for cinnamate metabolism have been studied in detail for the white-rot fungus Phlebia radiate and the reaction sequence has been proposed. (CO2)-C-14 release from carboxyl labeled cinnamate reached the maximum after 24 hrs on the medium with wheat straw and after 48 hrs on the media with glucose and spruce wood. In the case of the medium with cellulose the release of carbon dioxide increases linearility up to the 8(th) day of the cultivation. The evolution of carbon dioxide from aliphatic chain cleavage cinnamate showed very similar trend which demonstrated simultaneous process with the decarboxylation ones on all tested media. About 30% of carbon dioxide evolved from carboxyl-labeled cinnamate. The radioactivity in the mycelium was also above 10% in all cases and can be read as partially degraded or metabolized to the other components. The cellulose slightly repressed the decarboxylation of cinnamate in opposition to wheat straw and spruce wood, which doubled degradation. The maximum rate of decarboxylation was ca. 1.2% of the applied activity evolved as (CO2)-C-14. per hour. According to identified metabolites, at first the substrates after decarboxylation, and aliphatic chain cleavage were demethylated in the position 4 following the demethylation in the position 3 and finally aromatic ring cleavage were observed in air and oxygen aeration on the media with glucose, cellulose, wheat straw and spruce wood.									2	0	0	0	1	0	2			0023-6152			WOS:000271786000005

Although the involvement of Ca2+ at the oxidizing side of photosystem II of plants has been known for a long time, its ligand interactions and mode of action have remained unclear. In the study presented here, Cd-113 magic angle spinning solid-state NMR spectroscopy is used to probe the Ca2+-binding site in the water-oxidizing complex of Cd-113(2+)-substituted PS2. A single NMR signal 142 ppm downfield from Cd(CIO4)(2). 2H(2)O was recorded from Cd2+ present at the Ca2+-binding site. The anisotropy of the signal is small, as indicated by the absence of spinning side bands. The signal intensity is at its maximum at a temperature of -60 degrees C. The line width of the proton signal in a WISE (wide-line separation) two-dimensional H-1-Cd-113 NMR experiment demonstrates that the signal arises from Cd2+ in a solid and magnetically undisturbed environment. The chemical shift, the small anisotropy, and the narrow line of the Cd-113 NMR signal provide convincing evidence for a 6-fold coordination, which is achieved partially by oxygen and partially by nitrogen or chlorine atoms in otherwise a symmetric octahedral environment. The absence of a Cd-113 signal below -70 degrees C suggests that the Ca2+-binding site is close enough to the tetramanganese cluster to be affected by its electron spin state. To our knowledge, this is the first report for the application of solid-state NMR in the study of the membrane-bound PS2 protein complex.									31	0	0	0	20	0	32			0006-2960			WOS:000087631000001	10841753

We show convincing evidence for the very rare creation of recombinant mtDNA haplotypes by isolating human somatic hybrid cells and by generating mice carrying two different mtDNA haplotypes. To avoid misinterpretation of PCR-jumping products as recombinants, we used purified rntDNAs for cloning and sequencing. The results showed that only three of 318 clones of mtDNA purified from mouse tissues corresponded to recombinant mtDNA haplotypes, whereas no recombinants were found in human somatic hybrid cells. Such an extremely low frequency of mtDNA recombination does not require any revision of important concepts on human evolution that are based on its absence. Considering the high concentration of reactive oxygen species around the mtDNA and its frequent strand breakage, recombinant clones would correspond to gene conversion products created by repair of nucleotide mismatches.									41	0	0	0	40	1	41			0027-8424			WOS:000228738800031	15829586

Nevertheless, the BiFeO3 has been commonly prepared using complex and expensive fabrication techniques, e.g., epitaxial growth, radio frequency sputtering and pulsed laser deposition, which are not economically viable for large-scale production. Herein, we report a facile and scalable method for the fabrication of porous perovskite BiFeO3 photoanodes, as well as sequential interfacial engineering methods to enhance their photoelectrochemical performance for water splitting. Upon atomic layer deposition of a TiO2 overlayer and photo-assisted electrodeposition of a cobalt oxide/oxyhydroxide co-catalyst, the photocurrent density of the engineered photoanode for oxygen evolution reaction (1 M NaOH) significantly increased from negligible photocurrent of the pristine BiFeO3 to 0.16 mA cm(-2) at 1.23 V vs. reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) under simulated 1 sun irradiation (100 mW cm(-2), AM1.5G spectrum). Furthermore, such functionalization of the BiFeO3 photoanodes shifts the photoelectrochemical oxidation onset potential by 0.7 V down to 0.6 V vs. RHE. The significantly enhanced photoelectro-oxidation activity is facilitated by the improved charge transfer and electrochemical kinetics.									24	0	0	0	1	0	24			0038-092X			WOS:000528209300020

Lotay, Gavin/0000-0002-2918-7599			Direct measurement of astrophysically important resonances in K-38(p,gamma)Ca-39								PHYSICAL REVIEW C				97	2					025802	10.1103/PhysRevC.97.025802				FEB 21 2018	2018	Background: Classical novae are cataclysmic nuclear explosions occurring when a white dwarf in a binary system accretes hydrogen-rich material from its companion star. Novae are partially responsible for the galactic synthesis of a variety of nuclides up to the calcium (A similar to 40) region of the nuclear chart. Although the structure and dynamics of novae are thought to be relatively well understood, the predicted abundances of elements near the nucleosynthesis endpoint, in particular Ar and Ca, appear to sometimes be in disagreement with astronomical observations of the spectra of nova ejecta.Purpose: One possible source of the discrepancies between model predictions and astronomical observations is nuclear reaction data. Most reaction rates near the nova endpoint are estimated only from statistical model calculations, which carry large uncertainties. For certain key reactions, these rate uncertainties translate into large uncertainties in nucleosynthesis predictions. In particular, the K-38(p,gamma)Ca-39 reaction has been identified as having a significant influence on Ar, K, and Ca production. In order to constrain the rate of this reaction, we have performed a direct measurement of the strengths of three candidate l = 0 resonances within the Gamow window for nova burning, at 386 +/- 10 keV, 515 +/- 10 keV, and 689 +/- 10 keV.Method: The experiment was performed in inverse kinematics using a beam of unstable K-38 impinged on a windowless hydrogen gas target. The 39Ca recoils and prompt. rays from K-38(p,gamma)Ca-39 reactions were detected in coincidence using a recoil mass separator and a bismuth-germanate scintillator array, respectively.Results: For the 689 keV resonance, we observed a clear recoil-gamma coincidence signal and extracted resonance strength and energy values of 120(-30)(+50)(stat.)(-60)(+20)(sys.) meV and 679(-1)(+2)(stat.)+/- 1(sys.) keV, respectively. We also performed a singles analysis of the recoil data alone, extracting a resonance strength of 120 +/- 20(stat.)+/- 15(sys.) meV, consistent with the coincidence result. For the 386 keV and 515 keV resonances, we extract 90% confidence level upper limits of 2.54 meV and 18.4 meV, respectively.Conclusions: We have established a new recommended K-38(p,gamma)Ca-39 rate based on experimental information, which reduces overall uncertainties near the peak temperatures of nova burning by a factor of similar to 250. Using the rate obtained in this work in model calculations of the hottest oxygen-neon novae reduces overall uncertainties on Ar, K, and Ca synthesis to factors of 15 or less in all cases.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			2469-9985	2469-9993		WOS:000425604200005		
J	Nonnengiesser, K; Schuster, A; Koenig, F								Carotenoids and reaction center II-D1 protein in light regulation of the photosynthetic apparatus in Aphanocapsa								BOTANICA ACTA				109	2			115	124		10.1111/j.1438-8677.1996.tb00551.x				APR 1996	1996	A new cyanobacterial isolate, morphologically closely resembling Aphanocapsa, was characterized for its growth requirements, as well as pigmentation, photosynthetic activity and dynamics of the D1 protein in the reaction center (RC) of photosystem II (PSII). It was shown to be able to grow on glucose in the dark in the presence of DCMU. The cyanobacterium turned light yellow at high light intensity in the absence, and dark emerald green in high light in the presence of sublethal concentrations of the DCMU-type inhibitor atrazine. While total carotenoids per cell slightly decreased with increasing light intensity during growth, the cells still turned pale yellow due to decreased levels of chlorophyll and phycocyanin. In contrast to beta-carotene, zeaxanthin and echinenone which decreased with increasing light intensity during growth, the carotenoid glycoside, myxoxanthophyll, continuously increased in concentration.Extremely high rates of light-saturated O-2 evolution were recorded for the high light cultures after a 0.5 h recovery period in the dark. The recovery measured after 2.5 h was shown to be less effective in darkness than in dim light and was prohibited by chloramphenicol. The degree of recovery was dependent on the light intensity during growth. A fast light intensity-dependent RC II-D1 protein turnover was found for the bleached yellow cells rich in myxoxanthophyll. The half-life of the RC II-D1 protein, plotted against the light intensity during growth and experimentation, yielded a curve the slope of which was considerably steeper for Aphanocapsa than for Anacystis. Apparently, the isolated strain of Aphanocapsa reacts more vigorously to changes in the environment than other strains tested and may, therefore, turn out to be a suitable organism in the attempt to elucidate the molecular mechanism of light intensity adaptation.									17	0	0	0	14	0	17			0932-8629			WOS:A1996UR54500007

Unfortunately, current methanol oxidation electrocatalysts fall far short of expectations and suffer from rapid activity degradation. Here we report platinum-nickel hydroxide-graphene ternary hybrids as a possible solution to this long-standing issue. The incorporation of highly defective nickel hydroxide nanostructures is believed to play the decisive role in promoting the dissociative adsorption of water molecules and subsequent oxidative removal of carbonaceous poison on neighbouring platinum sites. As a result, the ternary hybrids exhibit exceptional activity and durability towards efficient methanol oxidation reaction. Under periodic reactivations, the hybrids can endure at least 500,000 s with negligible activity loss, which is, to the best of our knowledge, two to three orders of magnitude longer than all available electrocatalysts.									358	27	0	0	20	0	359			2041-1723			WOS:000366375500003	26602295

Al substitution at Ti site and presence of moderate amount of secondary CuO intergranular melt-like phase can improve the dielectric properties of the ceramics. Therefore, microwave-assisted solid-state reaction was used to synthesize polycrystalline CaCu3Ti4-xAlxO12 (x = 0, 0.025, 0.05, 0.075, 0.1) ceramics. Lattice parameters and different amount of CuO phase were extracted from X-ray diffraction data via Rietveld refinement. Presence of grains with different morphology, and different kind of interfaces were confirmed through microstructure evolution. An approximate elemental analysis was revealed through selective area EDX. Variations in dielectric and impedance properties with frequency and temperature were investigated as an effect of Al3+ substitution at Ti4+ sites and appearance of secondary CuO phase. Maximum dielectric constant (epsilon(r)) similar to 23,000 with 'tan delta' similar to 0.076 at 100 Hz has been observed for x = 0.05 ceramics at room temperature. Equivalent electrical circuits were proposed to understand the contributions arising from different electrically heterogeneous portions of CCTO-based ceramics. An elementary theoretical framework, based on different grains and interfaces (boundaries), has been proposed to understand the improved dielectric properties. Activation energies were calculated from imaginary part of impedance (Z '') and modulus (M '') functions and the values were in close agreement with activation energies associated to oxygen vacancies. In addition, defect chemistry has been discussed to understand the appearance of CuO phase as melt and the improvement of dielectric loss.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0957-4522	1573-482X		WOS:000741330200008

No any nocuous organic ligands were used in such self-sacrificing route, allowing for a green approach to prepare CdS QDs with clean surfaces and enough active sites. The deposition of CdS QDs onto Cd-Hap surfaces led to a dramatically enhanced performance in H-2 production under visible light irradiation as compared to bulk CdS nanoparticles. The optimal CdS QDs/Cd-Hap composite displayed a H-2 evolution rate of 14.1 jimol 11-1 without using any noble metal cocatalyst, which was about 4.2 times higher than that of pristine CdS. The apparent quantum efficiency for CdS QDs/Cd-Hap composite was up to 18%. It was also found that CdS QDs/Cd-Hap composite can continuously generate H2 from water in the presence of electron donors for more than 125 h. The enhanced photocatalytic performance of CdS QDs/Cd-Hap composites could be attributed to the high charge separation efficiency resulting from the efficient capture of photoinduced electrons by oxygen vacancies in Cd-Hap rods and the quantum confinement effect of CdS QDs with strong redox capacity as well as the increased active sites.

Herein we present an original fabrication route to effective electrocatalysts for the ethanol oxidation reaction (EOR). In particular, hierarchical MnO(2)nanostructures are grown on high-area nickel foam scaffolds by a plasma-assisted strategy and functionalized with low amounts of optimally dispersed Au nanoparticles. This strategy leads to catalysts with a unique morphology, designed to enhance reactant-surface contacts and maximize active site utilization. The developed nanoarchitectures show superior performances for ethanol oxidation in alkaline media. We reveal that Au decoration boosts MnO(2)catalytic activity by inducing pre-dissociation and pre-oxidation of the adsorbed ethanol molecules. This evidence validates our strategy as an effective route for the development of green electrocatalysts for efficient electrical-to-chemical energy conversion.									9	0	0	0	1	0	9			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000562931300008

Real-time analysis of the gaseous and liquid products of this reaction is highly desirable; however, few analytical techniques have been developed thus far to meet this need. Here, we demonstrate the first use of selected-ion flow-tube mass spectrometry (SIFT-MS) as an analytical tool capable of measuring in real time both the gas-and liquid-phase products of EC-CO2R in aqueous solution. SIFT-MS uses well-understood ion-molecule reactions to enable the analysis of similar multicomponent mixtures by preventing substantial fragmentation of the analyte. We lay out the framework in which to evaluate the tool's capabilities and show that the C-1-C-3 hydrocarbon, alcohol, and aldehyde products of CO2R should be quantitatively detectable.									7	0	0	0	0	0	7			2194-4288	2194-4296		WOS:000424274700012		
J	Kimura, Y; Ono, TA								Chelator-induced disappearance of carboxylate stretching vibrational modes in S-2/S-1 FTIR spectrum in oxygen-evolving complex of photosystem II								BIOCHEMISTRY				40	46			14061	14068		10.1021/bi011216w				NOV 20 2001	2001	Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy has been applied toward studies of photosynthetic oxygen evolution, especially on the effects of Call depletion and chelating agents using S-2/S-1 FTIR difference spectrum in the mid-IR region. Ca2+ depletion showed little influences on the symmetric (1365/1404 cm(-1)) and the asymmetric (1587/1562 cm-1) stretching bands of a carboxylate, which are typical of the S-2/S-1 vibrational features induced by the oxidation of the Mn-cluster; however, minor changes were observed in the amide regions. Addition of a chelating agent (EDTA or EGTA) to the Ca2+-depleted membranes resulted in the disappearance of the carboxylate bands concurrent with large modifications of the amide bands with an apparent K-d value of approximately 0.49 MM (for EDTA). The carboxylate bands and the greater part of the amide bands were restored by the replenishment of CaCl2, and the chelators did not affect the spectrum in the nondepleted control membranes, indicating that the effects of the chelator are reversible and manifest only in the cases in which the Ca2+ site is unoccupied by Ca2+. Ca2+-depleted membranes showed the normal S(2)Q(A)(-) thermoluminescence band, and further addition of EDTA did not show any effects on the peak temperature and peak intensity. Moreover, the Ca2+-depleted membranes in the presence of EDTA exhibited the S-2 multiline EPR signal with nearly the normal hyperfine splittings. These results demonstrated that the Mn-cluster is oxidized to the S-2 state with normal redox and magnetic properties in the presence of the chelator despite the loss of the carboxylate bands in the FTIR spectra. The results are interpreted as indicating that the chelator interacts with the Mn-cluster as a replacement of the native carboxylate ligand. This prevents the structural changes of the Mn-cluster and protein backbone which are induced upon the oxidation of the Mn-cluster up to the S-2 state, but preserve the redox and magnetic properties of the S-2 state Mn-cluster. The roles of Ca2+ in the photosynthetic oxygen evolution are also discussed.									37	0	0	0	31	0	37			0006-2960			WOS:000172244500037	11705399

Herein, novel ceria (CeO2) quantum dots (QDs) decorated sulfur-doped carbon nitride nanotubes (SCN NTs) were synthesized via a thermal polycondensation coupled in situ deposition precipitation method without use of template or surfactant. The structure and morphology studies indicate that ultrafine CeO2 QDs are well distributed inside and outside of SCN NTs offering highly dispersed active sites and a large contact interface between two components. This leads to the promoted formation of rich Ce3+ ion and oxygen vacancies as confirmed by XPS. The photocatalytic performance can be facilely modulated by the content of CeO2 QDs introduced in SCN matrix while bare CeO2 does not show activity of hydrogen production. The optimal catalyst with 10% of CeO2 loading yields a hydrogen evolution rate of 2923.8 mu mol h(-1) g(-1) under visible light, remarkably higher than that of bare SCN and their physical mixtures. Further studies reveal that the abundant surface defects and the created 0D/1D junctions play a critical role in improving the separation and transfer of charge carriers, leading to superior solar hydrogen production and good stability.

J	Xu Hao; Guo Wuqi; Wang Xiaoxuan; Feng Jiangtao; Yan Wei								Effects of Ultrasonic Field on Characteristics of Lead Dioxide Electrodes								Journal of Xi'an Jiaotong University				49	7			82	7, 148		10.7652/xjtuxb201507014				10 July 2015	2015	PbO2 electrodes were fabricated in the ultrasonic field by the electro-deposition to enhance their stability and catalytic performance in the electro-catalytic oxidation wastewater treatment. The composition and the performance of the electrode were investigated by SEM, XRD, the acceleration test and the electro-catalytic degradation test. The performances of the ultrasonic-PbO2 electrode were compared with that of the conventional PbO2 electrode. The results show that the surface morphology of PbO2 electrode is influenced by the ultrasonic field, and many flower-bunch-like bulges emerge on the surface of the electrode to increase its real surface area. The accelerated life and the voltage-stable period of the ultrasonic-PbO2 electrode are 166 h and 165 h, respectively, which are obviously longer than 100. 5 h and 50 h of the conventional PbO2 electrode. The oxygen-evolution potential of the ultrasonic-PbO2 electrode is 1. 67 V, which is higher than 1. 60 V of the conventional PbO2 electrode. It indicates that the ultrasonic-PbO2 electrode has a good performance in suppression of oxygen-evolution and gives an improvement on the electro-catalytic performance. When the scanning electric potential reaches 2. 0 V, the corresponding current density of the ultrasonic-PbO2 electrode is 0. 018 3 A/cm2, which is higher than 0. 006 85 A/cm2 of the conventional PbO2 electrode. This shows that the electro-conductivity of the former is better than that of the latter, which helps to reduce energy consumption in the electrolysis. The performance of the ultrasonic-PbO2 electrode is also better than that of the conventional PbO2 electrode in the degradation test of the acid red G solution. Its pseudo-first-order kinetics constant and total organic carbon removal rate are 0. 019 7 min-1 and 15. 6%, respectively, which are both higher than those of the conventional PbO2 electrode, while its energy consumption is lower than that of the conventional PbO2 electrode in the degradation test. Therefore, it can be concluded that the stability and the catalytic performance of PbO2 electrodes can be improved by introducing the ultrasonic filed.									0	8	0	0	0	0	8			0253-987X			INSPEC:16130133		
J	GATEAU, P; FRANCO, P								APPLICATION OF MECHANISTIC MODELS OF CHEMICAL-KINETICS TO INDUSTRIAL COMBUSTION - ILLUSTRATION BY SYNTHETIC GAS MANUFACTURING								REVUE DE L INSTITUT FRANCAIS DU PETROLE				46	3			407	419		10.2516/ogst:1991019				MAY-JUN 1991	1991	During the development of a partial combustion reactor for natural gas [1], Institut Francais du Petrole (IFP) has made use of a mechanistic model to determine the impact of operational parameters on the formation of soot. The model we chose deals with the oxidation and pyrolysis of light hydrocarbons by several hundred elementary reactions, some of which are shown in Table 1. All the species taken into consideration as well as their linking are shown in the flowchart in Fig. 3.Our data mainly came from References [2] and [8], from which we took all the reactions of species having three carbon atoms or less as well as the pyrolysis reactions of hydrocarbons with four carbon atoms. In this database, the kinetic coefficients of reactions between CH4 and the C2H5, C2H3 and C2H radicals were replaced by the values published in Reference [9].This set of reactions is not sufficient to analyze the formation of soot, and so we added on the pyrolysis reactions of acetylene from Reference [10]. The model assimilated the total mass of carbon contained in C5 and C6 hydrocarbons with a soot number assumed to be proportional to the mass of soot formed by the actual process simulated. This procedure was first checked by applying the model to various published experimental results.Mechanistic models are not calibrated, which opens up the possibilities of their use in very wide fields. On the other hand, to save computer time, they can be used only to deal with ideal reactors such as plugflow reactor and stirred reactor as well as with one-dimensional flames. It is thus important to know the similarities and differences between reactors of this type and actual combustion. To do this, reference is made to Figs. 4 and 5. As a geometric parameter, the model can take only the volume of the combustion chamber into consideration.Despite these restrictions, we wanted to know whether a stirred reactor could represent the behavior of a partialoxidation industrial reactor. For this we simulated tests performed in a pilot plant having the characteristics shown in Table 2. Figs. 8 and 9, which compare the measurements and computing, give encouraging results, especially for evolution of soot with the O2/C ratio.As an applied exercise, we dealt with the partial oxidation of natural gas in air. The partial oxidation of oxygen is applied industrially and served as a reference, even though there is no commercial process operating in air. The model indicates that such a process must operate with a very unusual preheating level, which a standard heat exchanger cannot reach. We thus show how important it is to undertake such a procedure before starting an experimental program.									3	0	0		0	0	3			0020-2274			WOS:A1991FN51800006

With increasing temperature, the total non-condensable gas yields in N2 and CO2 atmospheres increased. The thermochemical conversion of WP in CO2 led to a higher total non-condensable gas yield than the conversion in N2 because the thermal cracking of volatile species was promoted in the former case. Above 700 degrees C in the CO2 environment, the dehydrogenation of volatiles and hydrogenation of the CO2 agent greatly increased the CO and CH4 yields. In addition, the yields of polycyclic aromatic compounds, phenolic compounds, and benzene derivatives obtained in CO2 were lower than those obtained in N2 at all tested temperatures. The CO2 agent significantly decreased the yield of WP-derived char at > 700 degrees C; this was likely because it expedites the evolution of volatile species from WP during thermochemical conversion. The addition of WMF to the thermochemical conversion of WP decreased the CO and CO2 yields by lowering the oxygen content of the feedstock, the CH4 yield by suppressing the methanation reaction in the CO2 environment, and the yields of harmful aromatic compounds by lowering the overall lignin content of the feedstock; by contrast, the addition increased the yield of fuel-range hydrocarbons. The higher content of volatile matter in WMF compared with that of WP decreased the char yield compared with the case in which the thermochemical conversion of WP was performed without the additive.									3	0	0	0	1	0	3			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000729988900002

The evolution of the crystal structure and the electric property of (1-x)CBT-xBIT ceramics were investigated. (1-x)CBT-xBIT had an orthorhombic structure, and no impurity phases existed in. With the addition of BIT, the CBT part of 0.9CBT-0.1BIT ceramic had larger crystal structure distortion than CBT ceramics, especially the tilt from the c axis of the TiO6 octahedron layers. The crystal structure analysis indicated the enhanced octahedral tilt angle is beneficial to the ferroelectricicity of (1-x)CBT-xBIT ceramics. The residual polarization P-r of (1-x)CBT-xBIT ceramics (x=0, 0.1, 1) were 1.97 mu C/cm(2), 6.33 mu C/cm(2) and 2.28 mu C/cm(2), respectively. And, the addition of the BIT part increased the concentration of oxygen vacancy and affected the conduction mechanism. Two anomalies (T-m1 and T-m2) existed in the temperature dependence of the dielectric behavior corresponding to the phase transition. Besides, T-m2 and d(33) decreased with x increasing and T-m1 did not change markedly. Moreover, 0.9CBT-0.1BIT ceramic obtained the optimal piezoelectric constant (d(33)=15.2pC/N) and dc resistivity (1.6x10(5<bold>)cm at </bold>700 degrees C) compared to that (d(33)=15.2pC/N, 3.1x10(4<bold>)cm at </bold>700 degrees C) of CBT ceramics.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0957-4522	1573-482X		WOS:000467435300020

The investigation was aimed at understanding the dynamics of phytoplankton toxic blooms in relation to other planktonic species and environmental conditions. The study started on 10 March 2003, in coincidence with the first detection of Alexandrium minutum, a dinoflagellate known as a producer of Paralyzing Shellfish Toxins (PST) and lasted until 4 June 2003, when the bloom collapsed. The specific identity of A. minutum was confirmed on field mixed samples, through the use of species-specific PCR-primers targeting the 5.8S rDNA-ITS regions. Water samples and phytoplankton net hauls were taken approximately at 10 days intervals in the Verde Pond, one of the five basins of the Marinello ecosystem, in order to evaluate the incidence of toxic and non-toxic dinoflagellate species over the whole planktonic community. The evolution of the main environmental and trophic parameters (temperature, salinity, dissolved oxygen, POC, C/N, DIN, PO4-P) was simultaneously investigated. Alexandrium blooms were mostly characterized by A. minutum (max. 6 x 10(5) cells l(-1) on April 11) and Alexandrium tamarense as an associated species (max. 2.5 x 10(4) cells l(-1)on March 25). During the bloom, dinoflagellates or small flagellates dominated over the other taxa, with a minimum incidence of diatoms. The load of dissolved inorganic nitrogen was maximum in the pre-bloom phase (29 mu M on March 19), after which it decreased sharply. An oxygen supersaturation event was registered in coincidence with the A. minutum bloom. The amounts of POC ranged between 266 and 658 mu g l(-1) showing a discontinuous temporal trend. A recent introduction of A. minutum into the Verde Pond is suggested on the basis of the absence of this species in past years.					38th European Marine Biology Symposium38th European Marine Biology Symposium	SEP 08-12, 2003SEP 08-12, 2003	Univ Aveiro, Dept Biol; Fund LusoAmer Desenvolviment; Fund Calouste Gulbenk; Fund Cienc TecnolUniv Aveiro, Dept Biol; Fund LusoAmer Desenvolviment; Fund Calouste Gulbenk; Fund Cienc Tecnol	Univ Aveiro, Aveiro, PORTUGALUniv Aveiro, Aveiro, PORTUGAL	8	0	0	0	8	0	8			0018-8158			WOS:000234198500027

Artificial water splitting systems have struggled with orchestrating the kinetically complex absorption of four photons as well as the difficult utilization of visible light. Based on a detailed kinetic, spectroscopic and computational study of Milstein's ruthenium complex, we report a new mechanistic paradigm for water splitting, which requires only two photons and offers a new method to extend the range of usable wavelengths far into the visible region. We show that two-photon water splitting is enabled by absorption of the first, shorter wavelength photon, which produces an intermediate capable of absorbing the second, longer wavelength photon (up to 630 nm). The second absorption then causes O-O bond formation and liberation of O-2. Theoretical modelling shows that two-photon water splitting can be used to achieve a maximum solar-to-hydrogen efficiency of 18.8%, which could be increased further to 28.6% through photochemical instead of thermal H-2 release. It is therefore possible to exceed the maximum efficiency of dual absorber systems while only requiring a single catalyst. Due to the lower kinetic complexity, intrinsic utilization of a wide wavelength range and high-performance potential, we believe that this mechanism will inspire the development of a new class of water splitting systems that go beyond the reaction blueprint of photosynthesis.									8	0	0	0	0	0	7			1754-5692	1754-5706		WOS:000663024000001

The as-prepared samples were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), selected area electron diffraction (SAED), and X-ray photoelectron spectrometer (XPS). As the hydrothermal temperatures increases, the surface morphologies of the TiO2 changes from nanorods (150 degrees C) to nanobuds (180 degrees C), and finally to nanoflowers (210 degrees C). Evolution of these structures are accompanied by great variations of optical properties and photocatalytic activities including a narrowing of band gap from 3.01 to 2.97 eV, increase of UV-visible absorption intensity and specific surface area, and photocatalytic degradation efficiencies from 88.18 to 95.56%. Under ultraviolet light (UV light) irradiation, the TiO2 nanoflowers exhibit significantly activity (95.56%) in degradation of methyl orange (MO) compared to commercial P25 (76.15%). The outstanding photocatalytic activity of the TiO2 nanoflowers can be attributed to the synergetic effect of much larger specific surface area, the larger content of oxygen vacancy, and higher intensity of absorption. These findings help to grow unique TiO2 films with desired structure and activities for photocatalyst applications.									16	0	0	0	1	0	16			0947-8396	1432-0630		WOS:000397576400006

Microwave (MW) and radio frequency (RF) plasmas were used to deposit thin films with different composition from various precursor mixtures. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and atomic force microscopy (AFM) were used to reveal the evolution of the plasma treated coil coatings during weathering tests. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was employed to study the barrier properties of the coatings.The results show a degradation effect of the plasma treatment on the barrier properties of the coil coatings especially in the case of the oxygen-containing plasmas. However addition of a fluorine-containing component to the precursor mixture leads to the elimination of the negative effect of the plasma treatment on the barrier properties of the coil coatings. The fluorine-containing films exhibit higher weathering stability in comparison with the fluorine-free ones.					3rd International Materials Symposium/12th Meeting of the Sociedad-Portuguesa-da-Materials (Materials 2005/SPM)3rd International Materials Symposium/12th Meeting of the Sociedad-Portuguesa-da-Materials (Materials 2005/SPM)	MAR 20-23, 2005MAR 20-23, 2005	Portuguese Mat Soc; Mat Network Atlantic Arc; CiCECO; BPI; Bayer Mat Sci; DURIT; IZASA; GIC; Novagres; Rauschert; CRIOLAB CRYOGENICS Vacuum Syst Vacuum Chambers; FCT; NTI EUROPE; Fdn Calouste Gulbenkian; ScienTec; ThermoLab; Papelave; cienciapt net; Air LiquidePortuguese Mat Soc; Mat Network Atlantic Arc; CiCECO; BPI; Bayer Mat Sci; DURIT; IZASA; GIC; Novagres; Rauschert; CRIOLAB CRYOGENICS Vacuum Syst Vacuum Chambers; FCT; NTI EUROPE; Fdn Calouste Gulbenkian; ScienTec; ThermoLab; Papelave; cienciapt net; Air Liquide	Univ Aveiro, Aveiro, PORTUGALUniv Aveiro, Aveiro, PORTUGAL	2	0	0	0	0	0	2			0255-5476		*************	WOS:000238056400278

However, the lack of the host whole-genome information has impeded the full comprehension of the genotype/phenotype interface in Riftia. Here, we described the high-quality draft genome of Riftia, its complete mitogenome, and tissue-specific transcriptomic data. The Riftia genome presents signs of reductive evolution, with gene family contractions exceeding expansions. Expanded gene families are related to sulfur metabolism, detoxification, antioxidative stress, oxygen transport, immune system, and lysosomal digestion, reflecting evolutionary adaptations to the vent environment and endosymbiosis. Despite the derived body plan, the developmental gene repertoire in the gutless tubeworm is extremely conserved with the presence of a near intact and complete Hox cluster. Gene expression analyses establish that the trophosome is a multifunctional organ marked by intracellular digestion of endosymbionts, storage of excretory products, and hematopoietic functions. Overall, the plume and gonad tissues both in contact to the environment harbor highly expressed genes involved with cell cycle, programed cell death, and immunity indicating a high cell turnover and defense mechanisms against pathogens. We posit that the innate immune system plays a more prominent role into the establishment of the symbiosis during the infection in the larval stage, rather than maintaining the symbiostasis in the trophosome. This genome bridges four decades of physiological research in Riftia, whereas it simultaneously provides new insights into the development, whole organism functions, and evolution in the giant tubeworm.									1	0	0	0	1	0	1			0737-4038	1537-1719		WOS:000771141500010	34893862

In the last few decades effect of priming on the germination growth and physiology of plants were highlighted. Profiling energy compartmentalization in PSII using chlorophyll fluorescence kinetics and specific energy fluxes of primed seeds and plants has not been documented. It is crucial to discover the changes associated with the light-harvesting complexes, PSII functionality, and photochemical modulations occurring in the biochemical thylakoid membrane in response to priming and salt stress. The present study mainly focuses on photosystem II efficiency leading to physiological tolerance by seed priming. We grow the plants after seed priming with the solution of sodium chloride (75 and 150 mM), salicylic acid (1 and 2 mM), and calcium chloride (34 mM) and nitrate (20 mM). All the primed plants were subjected to salt stress 10 days after germination @ 0, 75, and 150 mM NaCl. Later germination, growth, morphology, physiology, PS II functionality and photochemical yield were evaluated. NaCl priming did more promising effects on energy compartmentalization, light-harvesting ability, and specific energy fluxes of photosystem II compared to salicylic acid and calcium salts under a stress environment. Maximum quantum yield (F-V/F-M), active reaction centers with higher efficiency of water splitting complex (F-V/F-O), restored electron flow, higher photochemical quenching (qP), oxygen evolution (SMT-phase), and almost negligible heat dissipation are associated with better osmotic adjustment and higher water uptake (RWC) under stress condition.									2	0	0	0	1	0	2			0981-9428	1873-2690		WOS:000783879500005	34952249

In recent decades, electrochemical reduction of CO2 has been extensively studied since it can reduce CO2 to value-added chemicals and fuels. Considering the sluggish reaction kinetics of the CO2 molecule, efficient and robust electrocatalysts are required to promote this conversion reaction. Here, recent progress and opportunities in inorganic heterogeneous electrocatalysts for CO2 reduction are discussed, from the viewpoint of both experimental and computational aspects. Based on elemental composition, the inorganic catalysts presented here are classified into four groups: metals, transition-metal oxides, transition-metal chalcogenides, and carbon-based materials. However, despite encouraging accomplishments made in this area, substantial advances in CO2 electrolysis are still needed to meet the criteria for practical applications. Therefore, in the last part, several promising strategies, including surface engineering, chemical modification, nanostructured catalysts, and composite materials, are proposed to facilitate the future development of CO2 electroreduction.									916	77	0	0	55	0	935			0935-9648	1521-4095		WOS:000376250600001	26996295

These techniques allow us to have a good control on the catalyst film surface morphology and crystallinity, with good adhesion of the catalysts on electrodes. Pure and binary metal oxides thin films based on Fe, Co and Ni were synthesized using electron beam deposition (EBD). WOC films are systematically studied through SEM microscopy, Raman spectroscopy and XPS analysis. Electrochemical characterization has been carried out to investigate the relevance of synergistic effects towards the water oxidation reaction.

It is thus very important to quantify these parameters and understand the mechanisms controlling the growth of NPs during the genesis process of the catalyst. Whereas conventional Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) is currently used for these purposes, it most frequently remains a 'static' method where results are obtained in high vacuum and post mortem, i.e. after the typical drying, calcination and reduction steps without the possibility to follow directly the evolution of both NPs and supports during those treatments. Environmental TEM (ETEM) unlocks this blocking and allows elementary mechanisms, such as Ostwald Ripening and coalescence to be unravelled through direct in situ observations. We report here an ETEM study of the preparation of Pd-based narrow NPs, less than 5 nm in size, deposited on a d-alumina support. We focused on 3 main objectives: (i) quantifying the sizes of NPs at each preparation step performed in situ under environmental (i.e. respectively oxygen or air and hydrogen atmospheres at working temperatures) and comparing them to post mortem measurements; (ii) identify the oxidation state of the NPs through an in situ High Resolution imaging study of their crystallographic structure; (iii) explore the possibilities of environmental tri-dimensional (3D) studies by tilt series based Electron Tomography. This last item represents a challenging breakthrough in the characterization of nanocatalysts; it will be demonstrated that the use of modern instruments (microscope and accessories) allows tomographic acquisitions to be performed very fast, within a few minutes and even seconds, which opens the way to the 3D tracking of microstructures almost in real time during their evolution under gas and at high temperature.					12th International Symposium on the Scientific Bases for the Preparation of Heterogeneous Catalysts (PREPA)12th International Symposium on the Scientific Bases for the Preparation of Heterogeneous Catalysts (PREPA)	JUL 08-12, 2018JUL 08-12, 2018		Univ Catholique Louvain, Louvain la Neuve, BELGIUMUniv Catholique Louvain, Louvain la Neuve, BELGIUM	8	0	0	0	1	0	8			0920-5861	1873-4308		WOS:000472188100009

The accuracy on the observed abundances is essential in order to make a reliable comparison with the models. The advantages of the infrared spectra in achieving this accuracy are discussed. Model prescriptions are varied until we achieve the simultaneous reproduction of all elemental features, which allows placing important constraints on the characteristic masses and nucleosynthetic processes experienced by the stellar progenitors. First of all, it is possible to separate the sample into two groups of PNe, one indicating the occurrence of only the third dredge-up during the TP-AGB phase, and the other showing also the chemical signature of hot-bottom burning. The former group is reproduced by stellar models with variable molecular opacities ( see Marigo 2002), adopting initial solar metallicity, and typical efficiency of the third dredge-up, lambda similar to 0.3- 0.4. The latter group of PNe, with extremely high He content (0.15 less than or equal to He/ H less than or equal to 0.20) and marked oxygen deficiency, is consistent with original sub-solar metallicity (i.e. LMC composition). Moreover, we are able to explain quantitatively both the N/H - He/H correlation and the N/H-C/H anti-correlation, thus solving the discrepancy pointed out long ago by Becker & Iben (1980). This is obtained only under the hypothesis that intermediate-mass TP-AGB progenitors (M greater than or similar to 4.5-5.0 M-.) with LMC composition have suffered a number of very efficient, carbon-poor, dredge-up events. Finally, the neon abundances of the He-rich PNe can be recovered by invoking a significant production of Ne-22 during thermal pulses, which would imply a reduced role of the Ne-22(alpha, n)Mg-25 reaction as neutron source to the s-process nucleosynthesis in these stars.									66	0	0	0	0	1	66			0004-6361	1432-0746		WOS:000185534000027

The function of PSI-K was characterized in Arabidopsis plants transformed with a psaK cDNA in antisense orientation, and several lines without detectable PSI-K protein were identified. Plants without PSI-K have a 19% higher chlorophyll alb ratio and 19% more P700 than wild-type plants. Thus, plants without PSI-R compensate by making more photosystem I. The photosystem I electron transport in vitro is unaffected in the absence of PSI-K. Light response curves for oxygen evolution indicated that the photosynthetic machinery of PSI-K-deficient plants have less capacity to utilize light energy. Plants without PSI-K have less state 1-state 2 transition. Thus, the redistribution of absorbed excitation energy between the two photosystems is reduced. Low temperature fluorescence emission spectra revealed a 2-nm blue shift in the long wavelength emission in plants lacking PSI-K. Furthermore, thylakoids and isolated PSI without PSI-K had 20-30% less Lhca2 and 30-40% less Lhca3, whereas Lhca1 and Lhca4 were unaffected. During electrophoresis under mildly denaturing conditions, all four Lhca subunits were partially dissociated from photosystem I lacking PSI-K, The observed effects demonstrate that PSI-K has a role in organizing the peripheral light-harvesting complexes on the core antenna of photosystem I.									119	5	0	0	117	0	133			0021-9258			WOS:000088683300064	10818090

Among the intensely studied photocatalytic systems, metal-free, pure organic and heterogeneous photocatalysts based on conjugated microporous polymers (CMPs), a class of organic porous materials featuring pi-conjugated backbone and permanent microporosity, draw much attention. The CMP-based photocatalysts are highly attractive because of their pure organic nature, ease of synthesis, structural diversity, and nontoxicity, as well as low costs. Over the past years, various CMPs have been synthesized for a broad range of photocatalytic applications. Herein, the aim is to deliver an updated summary of this field with the focus on crucial factors, which largely affect the catalytic performance of CMPs. To name a few, band structure, charge separation and transfer, and morphology are described combined with specific energy- and organosynthesis-related applications such as water splitting, CO2 reduction, organic photoredox reactions, etc.									24	0	0	0	1	0	23			2367-198X			WOS:000587042500001

This is the first study to tune the nanostructure of Co/N-doped carbon materials by providing a metal salt as the template and additive. The moderate surface area (699.47 m(2) g(-1)), highly developed pore structure, homogenous Co and N doping and designed "egg-box" structure impart Co/N-doped cross-linked porous carbon (Co/N-CLPC) with excellent electrocatalytic activity and capacitive performance. This material displayed an onset potential of 0.805 V (vs RHE), a current density of -5.102 mA cm(-2), excellent long-term durability, and good resistance to methanol crossover, which are comparable with the characteristics of a commercial 20-wt% Pt/C catalyst. In addition, Co/N-CLPC demonstrated a high specific capacitance of 313 F g(-1) at 0.5 A g(-1), notable rate performance of 63% at 50 A g(-1), and good cycling stability of 104.8% retention after 5000 cycles when used as a supercapacitor electrode. This method enables new routes to obtaining Co/N-doped nanocarbons with shape-controlled structures for energy conversion and storage applications.									10	2	0	0	0	0	10			0363-907X	1099-114X		WOS:000476956400016

Unfortunately, in most of the recent reports in this area, TOF is often not properly reported or not reported at all, in contrast to the overpotentials at a benchmarking current density. The current density is significant in determining the apparent activity, but it is affected by catalyst-centric parasitic reactions, electrolyte-centric competing reactions, and capacitance. Luckily, a properly calculated TOF can precisely give the intrinsic activity free from these phenomena in electrocatalysis. In this Viewpoint we ask: 1) What makes the commonly used activity markers unsuitable for intrinsic activity determination? 2) How can TOF reflect the intrinsic activity? 3) Why is TOF still underused in electrocatalysis? 4) What methods are used in TOF determination? and 5) What is essential in the more accurate calculation of TOF? Finally, the significance of normalizing TOF by Faradaic efficiency (FE) is stressed and we give our views on the development of universal analytical tools to determine the exact number of active sites and real surface area for all kinds of materials.									54	0	0	0	0	0	54			1433-7851	1521-3773		WOS:000695907700001	34523770

The gene (psbV) for cytochrome c-550 was cloned from the thermophilic cyanobacteria Thermosynechococcus (formerly Synechococcus) elongatus and T, (formerly Synechococcus) vulcanus, In both genomes, located downstream of psbV were a novel gene (designated psbV2) for a c-type cytochrome and petJ for cytochrome c-553. The deduced product of psbV2 showed composite similarities to psbV and petJ, Phenotype of psbV-disruptant in Thermosynechococcus was practically the same as that reported in Synechocystis sp, PCC 6803. Either psbV or psbV2 gene of T, elongatus was expressed in the psbV-disruptant of Synechocystis sp, PCC 6803, which resulted in recovery of the photoautotrophic growth. However, the enhanced requirement of Ca2+ or Cl- ions in the psbV-disruptant of Synechocystis was suppressed by expression of psbV but not by expression of psbV2, Thus, it is concluded that psbV2 can partly replace the role of psbV in PSII, The close tandem arrangement of psbV/psbV2/petJ implies that psbV2 was created by gene duplication and intergenic recombination during evolution.									41	0	0	0	40	1	46			0032-0781	1471-9053		WOS:000169342300007	11427679

However, the poor reversibility for sp(2) carbon bond forming reactions makes them unavailable for building high crystalline well-defined organic structures through a self-healing process, such as covalent organic frameworks (COFs). Here we report a scalable solution-processing approach to synthesize a family of two-dimensional (2D) COFs with trans-disubstituted C = C linkages via condensation reaction at arylmethyl carbon atoms on the basis of 3,5-dicyano-2,4,6-trimethylpyridine and linear/trigonal aldehyde (i.e., 4,4 ''-diformyl-p-terphenyl, 4,4'-diformyl-1,1'-biphenyl, or 1,3,5-tris(4-formylphenyl)benzene) monomers. Such sp(2) carbon-jointedpyridinyl frameworks, featuring crystalline honeycomb-like structures with high surface areas, enable driving two half-reactions of water splitting separately under visible light irradiation, comparable to graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) derivatives.									230	21	0	0	26	0	236			2041-1723			WOS:000470248000001	31171795

Differently from the crystal structure, ruthenium tends to adopt a 4-fold coordination with either terminal Ru=O or bridging Ru-O bonds in gas phase clusters. Our calculations show that three-dimensional compact structures are more preferred with the increase of the cluster size. For the low-lying (RuO2) n clusters, the cluster formation energy per RuO2 unit and the electron affinity are found to increase whereas the ionization potential is computed to decrease with the cluster size. Based on the optimized lower-energy structures of neutral and cationic (RuO2) n (n=1-5), the hydrolysis reactions of these clusters with water molecules have been further explored. The calculated results indicate that the adsorption of water molecules to the cationic species is much easier than the neutral ones. The overall hydrolysis reaction energies are more exothermic for the cationic clusters than for the neutral clusters. Our calculations indicate that thermodynamically, H2O can be more easily split on the cationic ruthenium oxide clusters than on the neutral clusters.									4	2	0	0	0	0	4			1001-604X	1614-7065		WOS:000338041200011

Since reactive oxygen species (ROS) are easily quenched by the developed antioxidative network, ROS-based treatments such as chemodynamic therapy (CDT) and radiotherapy (RT) for killing cancer cells are severely attenuated. To overcome such limitations, a bioactive nanosphere system is developed to regulate intracellular oxidative stress for enhanced radio-chemodynamic combination therapy by using bovine serum albumin (BSA) based bioactive nanospheres that are BSA assembled with in situ generated copper-bismuth sulfide nanodots and diallyl trisulfide (DATS). The copper-bismuth sulfide nanodots react with H2O2 to produce center dot OH and release Cu2+. Then, the Cu2+ further depletes GSH to generate Cu+ for more center dot OH generation in the way of Fenton-like reaction. Such a cascade reaction can initiate center dot OH generation and GSH consumption to realize CDT. The elevation of ROS triggered by the DATS from BBCD nanospheres further augments the breaking of redox balance for the increased oxidative stress in 4T1 cells. With the sensitization of increased oxidative stress and high Z element Bi, an enhanced radio-chemodynamic combination therapy is achieved. The current work provides an enhanced radio-chemodynamic combination treatment for the majority of solid tumors by using the co-assembled bioactive nanospheres as an amplifier of oxidative stress.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2056-3418	2056-3426		WOS:000826654400004	35855112

This catalyst was derived from the perovskite structure of La0.6Sr0.4Mn0.2Fe0.8O3-delta (LSMF) by simple annealing in a H-2 atmosphere and showed high current densities of 2.04, 1.43, and 0.884 A cm(-2) at 850, 800, and 750 degrees C, respectively, at a voltage of 1.5 V with corresponding total polarization resistance values of 0.205, 0.326, and 0.587 omega cm(2), respectively, at an open circuit voltage. The highly improved performance should be ascribed to the in situ exsolved Fe NPs anchored on Ruddlesden-Popper oxide and to the increased contents of oxygen vacancies in R.P.LSMF. More importantly, this active catalyst also exhibited a stable voltage profile for 100 h operation at an constant current density of 1.8 A cm(-2), suggesting that the catalyst Fe-R.P.LSMF proposed in this study is a highly promising candidate for use in an efficient SOEC cathode for CO2 electrolysis processes.									9	0	0	0	2	0	9			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000631723900001

The photoactivity assessment of composites obtained from cadmium sulfide (CdS) and zinc oxide (ZnO) hybridization as well the influence of reduced graphene oxide (RGO) on the photocatalytic activity to generate hydrogen and mitigate sulfide was performed under visible-light irradiation. The results of the X-ray diffraction analysis allowed us to identify the crystalline phases in each synthesized sample. The photocatalysts RGO/(CdS)(1.0)/(ZnO)(0.4) and RGO/(CdS)(1.0)/(ZnO)(0.73)/(ZnS)(0.57) showed the best performances for hydrogen production of 1.6 mmol g(cat)(-1)h(-1) and 1.4 mmol g(cat)(-1)h(-1), respectively, with mitigation of 80-90% of the sulfide content in the tannery wastewater. Long-term reaction tests indicated that the photocatalysts are active for a period of 24 h, and they retain the photoactivity after three photocatalytic cycles. The materials have demonstrated great potential for application in energy recovery from tannery wastewater with simultaneous sulfide abatement, especially the photocatalyst RGO/(CdS)(1.0)/(ZnO)(0.23)/(ZnS)(0.)(57), which is more eco-friendly because of its lower cadmium content and minimal leaching of this toxic metal ion during photocatalytic treatment.									4	0	0	0	0	1	4			2523-3963	2523-3971		WOS:000494952200015

Modification of MSP by N-bromosuccinimide (NBS) was carried out to explore the role of Trp241 in maintaining its structure and function. Data and arguments are presented to show that it is Trp241, not other tyrosines in MSP, that is involved in the modification and changes observed in this study, Further, the pH-dependence of the modification and the comparison of features of fluorescence spectra of MSP suggested that Trp241 is buried in the hydrophobic interior of the protein. Hydropathy analysis revealed that Trp241 is located in the middle of the hyrophobic region at the C-terminus of MSP. Circular dichroism spectroscopy showed that NBS modification of Trp241 dramatically modified the protein structure, The affinity of MSP to PSII decreased greatly after the modification of Trp241, and no oxygen-evolving activity was recovered after its reconstitution. This study provides a novel demonstration that Trp241 at the C-terminus hydrophobic region of the MSP is critical for maintaining appropriate structure and function of MSP.									15	6	0	0	12	0	19			0031-9317			WOS:000166377700014		
J	Sinha, Sumit					Sinha, Sumit/0000-0002-9163-7474			Transient evolution of suspended and benthic algae in a riverine ecosystem: A numerical study								ECOLOGICAL MODELLING				348				78	92		10.1016/j.ecolmodel.2017.01.008				MAR 24 2017	2017	It is a well-established fact that there is no direct resource competition between pelagic and benthic primary producers when their habitats are located in physically separate areas. However, the benthic habitat located at the bottom of the water column is affected by the light rays that gets attenuated as it passes through the pelagic zone and is obstructed by the algal cells and suspended material present in the water column. Therefore, benthic primary production is very much influenced by the conditions and concentrations in the pelagic zone. Another level of complexity is added to the system while considering the impact of flowing water in a riverine environment. In the research presented here a numerical model is developed to examine the impact of flow and nutrients on pelagic and benthic primary producers. The aforementioned numerical model solves advection diffusion and reaction (ADR) equation through TVD (total variation diminishing) - MacCormack scheme. The diffusion term is solved through central difference scheme. The model results are first validated by comparing the results with analytical solutions for the simplified case. The validated model is then applied to a 30 lugs stretch of the Bode River and simulations are conducted for multiple flow conditions. Impact of transient flow and nutrient boundary conditions on the evolution of algal trait is examined. Our simulation exercise highlights the importance of residence time in the temporal evolution of algae in pelagic and benthic zone and further identifies the most sensitive parameter influencing the evolution of the algal community modelled. Our research also reveals that largest uncertainty in the modelling stems from the wide range of entrainment rate that could be used for modelling resuspension of benthic algae in pelagic zone. The use of higher entrainment rate increased the algal concentration in the water column by 48% for identical flow conditions. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Ni-EDTA has significant impacts on human health because of its acute toxicity and low biodegradability, thus some appropriate approaches are required for its removal. In this research, a Ti3+ self-doped TiO2 nanotube arrays electrode (ECR-TiO2 NTA) was prepared and employed in electrochemical degradation of Ni-EDTA. The oxygen evolution potential of ECR-TiO2 NTA was 2.6 V vs. SCE. More than 96% Ni-EDTA and 88% TOC was removed after reaction for 120 min at current density 2 mA cm(-2) at pH 4.34. The degradation of Ni-EDTA was mainly through the cleavage of amine group within Ni-EDTA and furthermore decomposed it into small molecular acids and inorganic ions including NH4+ and NO3-. The electro-deposition of nickel ions at cathode was confirmed by XPS and was greatly affected by the pH of solution. The effects of current density, initial Ni-EDTA concentration, initial pH of solution and HCO3- concentration on Ni-EDTA degradation were investigated. The results exhibited that the ECR-TiO2 NTA had excellent efficiencies in electrochemical degradation of Ni-EDTA. The LSV analysis suggested that Ni-EDTA oxidation on ECR-TiO2 NTA anode and the production of hydroxyl radical (center dot OH) on the anode played an important role in the removal of Ni-EDTA.

In this perception we fabricated novel hierarchical CdS/MoS2-CoSe2 nanostructures via facile solvothermal route combined with ultra-sonication technique. Optical studies explored that synthesized nanostructures are most reliable host lattices for harvesting of visible light owing to their optimum energy band gap. The MoS2-CoSe2 encumbered on CdS nanorods component provided immense of hydrogen evolution (191.5 mmolg(-1)h(-1)) with outstanding stability. It is noteworthy that the observed H-2 evolution rate is much higher in synthesized structures as compared to numerous reported CdS based nanohybrids. The robust H-2 evolution rate and outstanding stability may be owing to fast charge carriers separation and migration between CdS and MoS2-CoSe2, creation of huge surface area and broad light harvesting nature. It is evident from PL, optical, photocurrent and impedance results. From the obtained results we believe that the proposed design strategy is preferable path way to develop new type of photocatalysts with robust H-2 evolution rate. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

In this paper, we report the cost-effective synthetic protocol for porous NiO hollow spheres in large scale through a simple spray drying strategy, using aqueous nickel ammonium carbonate complex solution, followed by calcination. The synthesized NiO hollow spheres calcined at 300 degrees C (NiO-300) are porous, made of nanoparticles in size range of 10-16 nm with a size range of 2.5-4 mu m and total surface area of 120 m(2)/g. The NiO-300 exhibited excellent bifunctional electrocatalytic water splitting characteristic, both OER, and HER, in basic solution. NiO-300 modified glassy carbon electrode showed superior water electrolysis kinetics and to achieve 10 mA cm(-2) current density, it required 370 mV overpotential for OER and 424 mV overpotential for HER in 1 M KOH. It is also worked well with cost-effective plastic chip electrode. An assembled two-electrode system by pairing NiO modified plastic chip electrode as both anode and cathode in a 1.0 M KOH electrolyte for overall water splitting exhibit clear bubble formation at 1.6 V potential.

In this communication, we present the synthesis, electrochemistry and AMFC test of a platinum-free HOR catalyst. The anode catalyst is prepared by growing palladium nanoparticles onto nanoparticles of an oxophilic metal (nickel), resulting in nano-dispersed, interconnected crystalline phases of Ni and Pd. When used in the anode of a hydrogen/air AMFC, such Pd/Ni catalyst exhibits high HOR activity, resulting in record high performance for a platinum-free AMFC (0.4 A cm(-2) at 0.6 V vs RHE). The enhancement of HOR catalytic activity vs. that observed at Pd (or Ni) alone is revealed directly in rotating disc electrode tests of this Pd/Ni catalyst that shows a significant negative shift (200 mV) of the onset potential for the HOR current vs. the case of Pd.

The wave was attributed to the oxidation of chloride to chlorine, demonstrated by smell of chlorine, by a view of formation of gas bubbles, by coloration through the reaction with diethyl-p-phenylene diamine, and by the increase in the anodic current with the concentration of chloride. Since no wave was observed in the ferrocene-free solution or KCl-free solution in this potential domain, the reaction mechanism was suggested to be the oxidation of chloride into chlorine catalyzed by micellar ferrocene. The potential at the foot of the wave (1.08 V) was less positive that the standard potential Of Cl(2)/Cl(-), and hence the reaction may be useful for enhancing the energetic efficiency at chlor-alkali industry. The value of the peak current was one-sixth the theoretical diffusion-controlled current, and was proportional to the square-root of the potential scan rate.

In this work, a 1-D transient coal combustion model with an empirical soot model was adopted and validated to study the effect of gas physicochemical properties and forced convection on soot cloud size (l(s)/r(0)). Tar gasification results in a larger l(s)/r(0) at any xO(2), while soot gasification has a limited effect at low x(O2) and leads to a larger soot cloud size at high x(O2). The effect of tar and soot diffusion becomes more important at higher oxygen mole fraction; a larger heat capacity leads to a larger soot cloud size. In O-2/N-2 environments, soot cloud size increases when Rep increases from 0 to 10 and decreases when Rep increases from 10 to 16. In O-2/CO2 environments, soot cloud size increases dramatically when Rep increases from 0 to 13 and slightly decreases when R-ep increases from 13 to 16. The l(s)/r(0) in O-2/CO2 is always larger than that in O-2/N-2. The effect of convection on soot cloud size has two sides. On one hand, the blow away effect tends to increase the l(s)/r(0). On the other hand, convection may increase or decrease total soot mass, leading to an increase or decrease of l(s)/r(0), respectively.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			1750-5836	1878-0148		WOS:000495026000006

Thanks to the recent development of high-resolution environmental transmission electron microscopes that can work robustly to accumulate observation data in controlled environments, we can deal with the electron irradiation effects and heterogeneity of real catalysts. We established a structural evolution diagram that summarizes the structure of catalysts under electron irradiation as a function of the electron current density phi and the electron dose, D. By extrapolating to phi = 0, D = 0, we could deduce the intrinsic catalysis structure (without electron irradiation) in various environments, including reaction environments. By numerically and statistically analyzing a substantial number of ETEM images of gold nanoparticles, we established a morphology phase diagram that summarizes how the majority of gold nanoparticles change their morphology systematically as a function of the partial pressures of CO and O-2. Similar diagrams will be helpful in elucidating the phenomena that directly correlate with the catalytic activity determined from ETEM observations. Using these quantitative analyses, we could analyze Cs-corrected ETEM images of the catalysts. The surfaces of gold nanoparticles were structurally reconstructed under reaction conditions, via interactions with CO molecules. CO molecules were observed on the surfaces of catalysts under reaction conditions using high-resolution ETEM. Finally, we discuss the potential of environmental transmission electron microscopy for quantitative in-situ microscopy at the atomic scale.									35	2	0	0	5	0	36			2050-5698	2050-5701		WOS:000317460700014	23325929

In this context, biomass (miscanthus) and sewage sludge have been investigated. A simultaneous thermal analyzer and mass spectrometer was used for the characterization of samples and identified the volatiles evolved during the heating of the sample up to 1100 degrees C under combustion and gasification conditions. The TG and DTA results were discussed in argon, oxygen, steam and steam blended gas atmospheres. Different stages of pyrolysis, combustion and gasification of the samples have been examined. It was shown that the combustion and gasification of char were occurred in two different temperature zones. The DTA-MS profile of the sample gives information on combustion and gasification process of the samples (ignition, peak combustion and burnout temperatures) and gases released (H-2, O-2, CO and CO2). The results showed that the different processes were mainly dependent on temperature. The evolution of the gas species was consistent with the weight loss of the samples during pyrolysis, combustion and gasification process. The effect of the ambiences during pyrolysis, combustion and gasification of the samples were reported. The appropriate temperature range to the sludge and miscanthus gasification was evaluated. The kinetic parameters of the biomass and sewage sludge were estimated for TGA using two models based on first-order reactions with distributed activation energies. The presence of ash in the biomass char was more influential during the gasification process. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

An amount of 100 mg of asphaltene was carefully applied to an electrode and exposed to air-plasma glow discharge at a pressure of 1.0 Torr. The plasma was generated in a stainless steel discharge chamber by an ac generator at a frequency of 60 Hz, output power of 50 W and a gas flow rate of 1.8 L/min. The electron temperature and ion density were estimated to be 2.15 +/- 0.11 eV and (1.24 +/- 0.05) x 10(16) m(-3), respectively, using a double Langmuir probe. OES was employed to observe the emission from the asphaltene exposed to air plasma. Both molecular band emission from N-2, N-2(+), OH, CH, NH, O-2 as well as CN, and atomic light emission from V and H-gamma were observed and used to monitor the evolution of asphaltene erosion. The asphaltene erosion was analyzed with the aid of a scanning electron microscope (SEM) equipped with an energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) detector. The EDX analysis showed that the time evolution of elements C, O, S and V were similar; and the chemical composition of the exposed asphaltenes remained constant. Particle size evolution was measured, showing a maximum size of 2307 mu m after 60 min. This behavior is most likely related to particle agglomeration as a function of time.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			1009-0630			WOS:000303757800007		
J	Arima, Makoto; Kozai, Yusuke								Diamond dissolution rates in kimberlitic melts at 1300-1500 degrees C in the graphite stability field								EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF MINERALOGY				20	3			357	364		10.1127/0935-1221/2008/0020-1820				MAY-JUN 2008	2008	A series of diamond dissolution experiments were conducted in the graphite stability field under the metal iron-wustite (IW) oxygen buffer to evaluate the rate of diamond dissolution reactions into two sets of kimberlitic solvents having different CO2 and H2O contents. The solvents used were a natural kimberlite from Wesselton Mine, South Africa and a synthetic H2O-free and CO2-rich kimberlite. Experiments with the Wesselton kimberlite were carried out at 1400 and 1500 degrees C under 1.0 GPa and those with the synthetic kimberlite were conducted at 1500 degrees C under 2.5 GPa. In both series of experiments, the diamond crystal form changed from that of a sharp octahedron through a combination of octahedron and hexoctahedroidal forms to a spherical trioctahedroidal with increasing run duration. The natural and synthetic kimberlitic solvents produced contrasting etch characteristics on the diamond crystal Surfaces. Negatively-oriented trigons were formed on the octahedral {1 1 1} faces in the runs with the natural kimberlite agent; while diamond surfaces were covered by both negatively and positively oriented smaller trigons and larger hexagonal etch pits in the runs with the synthetic kimberlite solvent. The degree of dissolution was highly sensitive to temperature and carbonate solubility of the solvent. The diamond dissolution rate (radius loss of the diamond crystal) was 0.012 mm/h at 1400 degrees C and 0.066 mm/h at 1500 degrees C in the Wesselton kimberlite solvent, and 0.024 mm/h at 1500 degrees C in the synthetic kimberlite solvent. The data give an activation energy of similar to 342 kJ/mol for the diamond dissolution reaction in the natural kimberlite solvent at 1.0 GPa under the IW buffer.									29	0	1	0	1	0	31			0935-1221			WOS:000262892100007		
J	Paquet, Philippe; Pierard, Gerald E.								Toxic epidermal necrolysis: Revisiting the tentative link between early apoptosis and late necrosis								INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR MEDICINE				19	1			3	10						JAN 2007	2007	Toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) is a dramatic drug-induced reaction that may lead to full destruction of the epidermis and epithelial mucosae. The keratinocytes themselves seem to play a major role in the pathogenic mechanism. Biochemical and morphological studies performed on early epidermal lesions demonstrated that keratinocytes undergo apoptosis, but histological and clinical data show evidence of necrosis of the epidermis later in the disease evolution. Based on the limited information currently available about TEN pathomechanism, we present a 'mitochondrial hypothesis' that may explain both early apoptosis and late necrosis in TEN epidermis. Strong electrophilic drug metabolites are generated in TEN-affected keratinocytes due to an impaired detoxication pathway. These compounds presumably disrupt the electron transfer chain in the mitochondriae resulting in a decline in ATP production, loss of electrochemical gradient across the inner membrane (Delta psi m), and partial reduction in O-2 with production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). The latter compounds directly damage cell membranes and act as intracellular chemical messengers stimulating proapoptotic systems such as CD95 and TNF-alpha, which in turn can activate nitric oxide (NO) metabolism. NO interacts with ROS to enhance their toxic effects. These proapoptotic events represent swift processes in the involved cells. The loss of AVm and the opening of permeability transition pores in the mitochondrial membrane lead to osmotic swelling and rupture of these organelles with subsequent necrosis of the cell. The necrotic events follow apoptosis when both phenomena are present.									34	1	0	0	15	0	36			1107-3756			WOS:000243147400001	17143541

Herein, iron phosphide (Fe2P)-embedded nitrogen-doped carbon (Fe2P/NPGC) composites are obtained as cathode [oxygen reduction reaction (ORR)] catalysts to enhance the resistance to catalyst poisoning to ensure the longterm stability of bioelectricity generation in MFCs. MFCs with the Fe2P/NPGC (850 degrees C) catalyst cathode can obtain a maximum power density of 1.050 W m(-2), which is higher than that of commercial Pt/C (0.952 W m(-2)). After 1900 h of operation, the decline of power density is only 1.967% in MFCs with the Fe2P/NPGC (850 degrees C) cathode, while the decline of Pt/C is 18.77%. The well-crystallized Fe2P embedded in NPGC can improve the ORR activity and the generation of strong oxidizing substances (center dot OH and center dot O-2(-)) to oxidize the poisoning substances and inhibit the attachment of biofilms to improve the ORR stability. The N-doped carbon structure with good electrical conductivity should lower the charge transfer resistance to reduce energy loss during ORR. The particle-embedded structure of Fe2P/NPGC (850 degrees C) not only improves the durability of active sites but also boosts the reduction of O-2 and/or ORR-related intermediates via a four-electron process. Therefore, the hexagonal Fe2P can be used as a promising active component for obtaining high ORR activity/stability in air cathode MFCs.									8	0	0	0	1	0	8			2168-0485			WOS:000553241400016

The kinetic data were obtained under the following operating conditions: 550-700 degrees C; steam-to-carbon ratio in the feed (S/C), 1.5-6.0; space-time, of up to 0.38 gcatalysth/gBO; time on stream, up to 5 h. Experiments in the absence of catalyst were also carried out with a view to quantifying the contribution of thermal routes of bio-oil decomposition. A kinetic scheme with six reaction steps is assumed for the process, and contribution of thermal and catalytic routes are considered in the kinetic equations. The reaction steps are: i) SR of bio-oil (C3.9H6.1O3.0); ii) water-gas-shift (WGS) reaction; iii) bio-oil decomposition (thermal/catalytic) into (CO + CH4 + H-2); iv) bio-oil decomposition (thermal/catalytic) into (CO2 + hydrocarbons + H-2); v) methane SR and vi) hydrocarbons SR. The kinetic model also considers the catalyst deactivation by means of a deactivation equation, which is dependent on the partial pressure of bio-oil oxygenates. The complete kinetic model proposed is suitable for predicting the evolution with time on stream of the concentration of products (H-2, CO2, CO, CH4, hydrocarbons), un-reacted bio-oil and water in the reaction medium for the whole range of operating conditions studied.									22	0	0	0	3	0	22			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000414913700023

The synthesis and introduction of these far-red chlorophylls into the photosynthetic apparatus of plants might improve the efficiency of oxygenic photosynthesis, especially in far-red enriched environments, such as in the lower regions of the canopy(3). Production of Chl f requires the ChlF subunit, also known as PsbA4 (ref. (4)) or super-rogue D1 (ref. (5)), a paralogue of the D1 subunit of photosystem II (PSII) which, together with D2, bind cofactors involved in the light-driven oxidation of water. Current ideas suggest that ChlF oxidizes Chl a to Chl f in a homodimeric ChlF reaction centre (RC) complex and represents a missing link in the evolution of the heterodimeric D1/D2 RC of PSII (refs. (4,6)). However, unambiguous biochemical support for this proposal is lacking. Here, we show that ChlF can substitute for D1 to form modified PSII complexes capable of producing Chl f. Remarkably, mutation of just two residues in D1 converts oxygen-evolving PSII into a Chl f synthase. Overall, we have identified a new class of PSII complex, which we term 'super-rogue' PSII, with an unexpected role in pigment biosynthesis rather than water oxidation.The cyanobacterial chlorophyll, Chl f, absorbs far-red light. Mutation of two residues in a subunit of photosystem II converts it to a Chl f synthase. This 'super-rogue' photosystem might improve photosynthetic efficiency in low light.									14	0	0	0	11	0	14			2055-026X	2055-0278		WOS:000519577200015	32170286

Evolution, especially evolution in the distant past, is not easily accessible to laboratory experimentation. Modelling can provide a window into evolutionary processes by allowing the examination of selective pressures which lead to particular optimal solutions in the model. To study the evolution of C4 photosynthesis from a ground state of C3 photosynthesis, we initially construct a C3 model. After duplication into two cells to reflect typical C4 leaf architecture, we allow the model to predict the optimal metabolic solution under various conditions. The model thus identifies resource limitation in conjunction with high photorespiratory flux as a selective pressure relevant to the evolution of C4. It also predicts that light availability and distribution play a role in guiding the evolutionary choice of possible decarboxylation enzymes. The data shows evolutionary CBM in eukaryotes predicts molecular evolution with precision.									17	0	0	0	14	0	17			2050-084X			WOS:000502274900001	31799932

In principle, the preferential fixation of particular mutations could stem directly from variation in the underlying rate of mutation to function-altering alleles. However, the influence of mutation bias on the genetic architecture of phenotypic evolution is difficult to evaluate because data on rates of mutation to function-altering alleles are seldom available. Here, we report the discovery that a single point mutation at a highly mutable site in the beta(A)-globin gene has contributed to an evolutionary change in hemoglobin (Hb) function in high-altitude Andean house wrens (Troglodytes aedon). Results of experiments on native Hb variants and engineered, recombinant Hb mutants demonstrate that a nonsynonymous mutation at a CpG dinucleotide in the beta(A)-globin gene is responsible for an evolved difference in Hb-O-2 affinity between high-and low-altitude house wren populations. Moreover, patterns of genomic differentiation between high-and low-altitude populations suggest that altitudinal differentiation in allele frequencies at the causal amino acid polymorphism reflects a history of spatially varying selection. The experimental results highlight the influence of mutation rate on the genetic basis of phenotypic evolution by demonstrating that a large-effect allele at a highly mutable CpG site has promoted physiological differentiation in blood O-2 transport capacity between house wren populations that are native to different elevations.									61	3	0	0	56	0	63			0027-8424			WOS:000364470300068	26460028	
J	Fields, BD; Olive, KA					Fields, Brian/0000-0002-4188-7141; Olive, Keith/0000-0001-7201-5998			The revival of galactic cosmic-ray nucleosynthesis?								ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL				516	2			797	810		10.1086/307145				MAY 10 1999	1999	Because of the roughly linear correlation between Be/H and Fe/H in low-metallicity halo stars, it has been argued that a "primary" component in the nucleosynthesis of Be must be present in addition to the "secondary" component from standard Galactic cosmic-ray nucleosynthesis. In this paper we critically reevaluate the evidence for the primary versus secondary character of Li, Be, and B (LiBeB) evolution, analyzing both the observations and Galactic chemical evolution models. Although it appears that [Be/H] versus [Fe/H] has a logarithmic slope near 1, it is rather the Be-O trend that directly arises from the physics of spallation production. Using new abundances for oxygen in halo stars based on UV OH lines, we find that in Population II stars for which O has been measured, the Be-O slope has a large uncertainty due to systematic effects. Namely, the Be-O logarithmic slope lies in the range 1.3-1.8, rendering it difficult to distinguish from the data between the secondary slope of 2 and the primary slope of 1. The possible difference between the Be-Fe and Be-O slopes is a consequence of the variation in O/Fe versus Fe: recent data suggest that the best-fit O/Fe-Fe slope for Population II is in the range -0.5 to -0.2, rather than zero (i.e., Fe proportional to O) as is often assumed. In addition to this phenomenological analysis of Be and B evolution, we have also examined the predicted LiBeB, O, and Fe trends in Galactic chemical evolution models that include outflow. Based on our results, it is possible that a good fit to the LiBeB evolution requires only the traditional Galactic cosmic-ray spallation and the (primary) neutrino-process contribution to B-11. We thus suggest that these two processes might be sufficient to explain Li-6, Be, and B evolution in the Galaxy, without the need for an additional primary source of Be and B. However, the uncertainties in the data at this time prevent one from reaching a definitive conclusion. Fortunately, several observational tests of this "neoclassical" scenario are available; we note in particular the importance of further observations to secure the O/Fe Population II trend, as well as accurate measurements of B/Be, Li-6/Be, and B-11/B-10 in halo stars.									78	0	0	0	0	0	78			0004-637X			WOS:000080811000026

In the GCD model, a detonation is triggered by the surface flow due to single-point, off-center flame ignition in carbon-oxygen white dwarfs (WDs). The simulations are unique in terms of the degree to which nonidealized physics is used to treat the reactive flow, including weak reaction rates and a time-dependent treatment of material in nuclear statistical equilibrium (NSE). Careful attention is paid to accurately calculating the final composition of material which is burned to NSE and frozen out in the rapid expansion following the passage of a detonation wave over the high-density core of the WD; and an efficient method for nucleosynthesis postprocessing is developed which obviates the need for costly network calculations along tracer particle thermodynamic trajectories. Observational diagnostics are presented for the explosion models, including abundance stratifications and integrated yields. We find that for all of the ignition conditions studied here a self-regulating process comprised of neutronization and stellar expansion results in final Ni-56 masses of similar to 1.1 M-circle dot. But, more energetic models result in larger total NSE and stable Fe-peak yields. The total yield of intermediate mass elements is similar to 0.1 M-circle dot and the explosion energies are all around 1.5 x 10(51) erg. The explosion models are briefly compared to the inferred properties of recent SN Ia observations. The potential for surface detonation models to produce lower-luminosity (lower Ni-56 mass) SNe is discussed.									69	3	0	0	0	0	69			0004-637X	1538-4357		WOS:000264095100013

A shift in the band edge was caused by the intrinsic dipole of the ligand and the induced dipole at the ligand/ReS2 interface. The upward shift in the band edge was tuned over a large range by choosing suitable polar ligands, controlling the surface coverage by the ligand, functionalizing the ligand and building heterostructures. The C6H5CN/ReS2/MoS2 and C6H5CH2CN/ReS2/MoS2 van der Waals heterostructures are ideal candidates for use as photocatalysts in the splitting of water as a result of their strong absorption in the visible region, suitable band edge positions, reduced electron-hole recombination and good stability. Our findings show the potential for creating novel photocatalysts based on van der Waals heterostructures of ReS2.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			1463-9076	1463-9084		WOS:000532479300024	32313909

Samples of three different thicknesses were prepared by spin-coating onto polished titanium to achieve uniform and well-defined coatings. The resulting electrodes were characterized with a variety of methods, including both physical and electrochemical methods. Doping with cobalt led to a larger number of micrometer-sized cracks in the coating, and coating grains half the size compared to the undoped samples (10 instead of 20 nm across). This is in agreement with a voltammetric charge twice as high, as estimated from cyclic voltammetry. There is no evidence of a Co3O4 spinel phase, suggesting that the cobalt is mainly incorporated in the overall rutile structure of the (Ti,Ru)O-2. The doped electrodes exhibited a higher activity for cathodic hydrogen evolution compared to the undoped electrodes, despite the fact that one third of the active ruthenium was substituted with cobalt. For anodic chlorine evolution, the activity was similar for both electrode types. (C) 2013 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

At platinum electrode in the ILs, the first step of hydrogen oxidation is the formation of Pt-H(ad) (the Tafel step), which is similar to those observed in the aqueous electrolytes. However, there are differences in the oxidation steps (the Heyrovsky and Volmer steps). In ILs, the oxidation of Pt-H(ad) forms a hydrogen radical and a proton rather than a proton or a water in aqueous acid or alkaline electrolytes, respectively. This difference is significant as it results in a completely different following reaction pathway in the anaerobic vs aerobic conditions. A coupled chemical reaction between oxygen and hydrogen oxidation intermediates was observed in aerobic conditions which has a correlation with hydrogen concentrations. Furthermore, the overall rate of hydrogen oxidation is shown to be much higher in [Bmpy] [NTf2] than that of [Bmim][NTf2], which is rationalized as the result of both higher solubility of hydrogen and the unique IL-electrode interface structure which promotes the hydrogen adsorption in [Bmpy][NTf2] than that of [Bmim][NTf2]. This study is the first example showing that hydrogen oxidation mechanism in aprotic ILs follows two different oxidation mechanisms in anaerobic and aerobic conditions.									13	1	0	0	3	0	14			1932-7447			WOS:000386107600026	29043009

Here, we identified 56 full-length trihelix genes in Populus trichocarpa and classified them into five groups. Most genes within a given group had similar gene structures and conserved motifs. The trihelix genes were unequally distributed across 19 different linkage groups. Fifteen paralogous pairs were identified, 14 of which have undergone segmental duplication events. Promoter cis-element analysis indicated that most trihelix genes contain stress-or phytohormone-related cis-elements. The expression profiles of the trihelix genes suggest that they are primarily expressed in leaves and roots. Quantitative real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction analysis indicated that members of the trihelix gene family are significantly induced in response to osmotic, abscisic acid, salicylic acid, methyl jasmonate and pathogen infection. PtrGT10 was identified as a target gene of miR172d, which is involved in the osmotic response. Repression of PtrGT10 could increase reactive oxygen species scavenging ability and decrease cell death. This study provides novel insights into the phylogenetic relationships and functions of the P. trichocarpa trihelix genes, which will aid future functional studies investigating the divergent roles of trihelix genes belonging to other species.									23	3	0	0	20	0	26			2045-2322			WOS:000386215700001	27782188

Deposition of the Co-Pi catalyst on the Indium Tin Oxide (ITO)-passivated p-side of a np-Si junction enables the majority of the voltage generated by the solar cell to be utilized for driving the water-splitting reaction. Operation under neutral pH conditions fosters enhanced stability of the anode as compared to operation under alkaline conditions (pH 14) for which long-term stability is much more problematic. This demonstration of a simple, robust construct for photo-assisted water splitting is an important step towards the development of inexpensive direct solar-to-fuel energy conversion technologies.									172	4	0	0	30	0	174			0027-8424			WOS:000291857500013	21646536

Such an understanding can be obtained by in situ monitoring of dynamic reaction processes using surface-sensitive techniques. Surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) can provide rich structural information with ultrahigh surface sensitivity, even down to the single-molecule level, which makes it a promising tool for the in situ study of catalysis. However, only a few metals (like Au, Ag, and Cu) with particular nanostructures can generate strong SERS effects. Thus, it is almost impossible to employ SERS to study transition metals (like Pt, Pd, Ru, etc.) and other nonmetal materials that are usually used in catalysis (material limitation). Furthermore, SERS is also unable to study model single crystals with atomically flat surface structures or practical nanocatalysts (morphology limitation). These limitations have significantly hindered the applications of SERS in catalysis over the past four decades since its discovery, preventing SERS from becoming a widely used technique in catalysis. In this Account, we summarize the extensive efforts done by our group since the 1980s, particularly in the past decade, to overcome the material and morphology limitations in SERS. Particular attention has been paid to the work using core-shell nanostructures as SERS substrates, because they provide high Raman enhancement and are highly versatile for application on different catalytic materials. Different SERS methodologies for catalysis developed by our group, induding the "borrowing" strategy, shell-isolated nanoparticle-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SHINERS), and SHINERS-satellite strategy, are discussed in this account, with an emphasis on their principles and applications. These methodologies have successfully overcome the long-standing limitations of traditional SERS, enabling in situ tracking of catalysis at model single-crystal surfaces and practical nanocatalysts that can hardly be studied by SERS. Using these methodologies, we systematically studied a series of fundamentally important reactions, such as oxygen reduction reaction, hydrogen evolution reaction, electrooxidation, CO oxidation, and selective hydrogenation. As such, direct spectroscopic evidence of key intermediates that can hardly be detected by other traditional techniques was obtained. Combined with density functional theory and other in situ techniques, the reaction mechanisms and structure-activity relationships of these catalytic reactions were revealed at a molecular level. Furthermore, the future of SERS in catalysis has also been proposed in this work, which we believe should be focused on the in situ dynamic studies at the single-molecule, or even single-atom, level using techniques with ultrahigh sensitivity or spatial resolution, for example, single-molecule SERS or tip-enhanced Raman spectroscopy. In summary, core-shell nanostructure-enhanced Raman spectroscopies are shown to greatly boost the application of SERS in catalysis, from model systems like single-crystal surfaces to practical nanocatalysts, liquid-solid interfaces to gas-solid interfaces, and electrocatalysis to heterogeneous catalysis to photocatalysis. Thus, we believe this Account would attract increasing attention to SERS in catalysis and opens new avenues for catalytic studies.									70	10	0	0	2	0	72			0001-4842	1520-4898		WOS:000527732000002	32031367

As a euryhaline species, it has evolved adaptive mechanisms responding to the complex and changeable intertidal environment that it inhabits. To investigate the genetic basis of this salinity adaptation mechanism, we conducted a genome-wide association study using phenotypically differentiated populations (hyposalinity and hypersalinity adaptation populations, and control population), and confirmed our results using an independent population, high-resolution melting, and mRNA expression analysis. For the hyposalinity adaptation, we determined 24 genes, including Cg_CLCN7 (chloride channel protein 7) and Cg_AP1 (apoptosis 1 inhibitor), involved in the ion/water channel and transporter mechanisms, free amino acid and reactive oxygen species metabolism, immune responses, and chemical defence. Three SNPs located on these two genes were significantly differentiated between groups, as was Cg_CLCN7. For the hypersalinity adaptation, the biological process for positive regulating the developmental process was enriched. Enriched gene functions were focused on transcriptional regulation, signal transduction, and cell growth and differentiation, including calmodulin (Cg_CaM) and ficolin-2 (Cg_FCN2). These genes and polymorphisms possibly play an important role in oyster hyposalinity and hypersalinity adaptation. They not only further our understanding of salinity adaptation mechanisms but also provide markers for highly adaptable oyster strains suitable for breeding.									7	0	0	0	6	0	7			2045-2322			WOS:000434252000019	29875442

Increase in the calcination temperature of titanium doped Fe2O3 thin films from 450 degrees C to 550 degrees C provides significant enhancement in their efficiency for water oxidation to evolve O-2, which is four-electron transfer slow reaction. In contrast, such a calcination effect is not remarkable for oxidation of I- to I-3(-), which is two-electron transfer fast reaction. The electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) study indicates that the surface reaction rates feature heterogeneity only for water oxidation. This heterogeneity in EIS responses decreased with increasing calcination temperature. This shows that calcination creates photoactive surface sites with doped Ti4+ species especially for kinetically limited water oxidation. Long-lived photoholes might be effectively captured in the vicinity of these sites to suppress surface recombination and induce multi-electron transfer water oxidation. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Methionine (Met) residues are particularly sensitive to ROS-mediated oxidation, leading to the formation of methionine sulfoxide (MetSO) under mild oxidative conditions. Methionine sulfoxide reductase (MSR) repairs oxidized Met and protects plants from oxidative damage. Herein, we identified a tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum) MSRB gene, referred to as NtMSRB3. Analysis of the sequence showed that the NtMSRB3 protein had four typical motifs in a SelR domain, which is known as the catalytic region of MSRBs. NtMSRB3 specifically reduced the R epimer of MetSO and converted either free MetSO or Dabsyl-MetSO in the presence of dithiothreitol. Escherichia coli cells harboring NtMSRB3 displayed relative high viability under H2O2 stress. Subcellular localization of NtMSRB3 revealed that it was a plastid-targeted protein. Furthermore, the semi-quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction assay showed that NtMSRB3 was upregulated apparently by abscisic acid, salt, cold, and methyl viologen stress within 24 h of treatment.									5	1	0	0	4	0	6			1572-3887	1573-4943		WOS:000326081300006	24114470

In this regard, hydrogen production through photo- or electrocatalytic water splitting has continued to gain ever-growing interest. However, the existing catalysts are still unable to fulfill the demands of high-efficiency, low-cost, and sustainable hydrogen production. Layered metal trichalcogenidophosphate (MPQ(3)) is a newly developed two-dimensional material with tunable composition and electronic structure. Recently, MPQ(3) has been considered a promising candidate for clean energy generation and related water splitting applications. In this minireview, we firstly introduce the structure and methods for the synthesis of MPQ(3) materials. In the following sections, recent developments of MPQ(3) materials for photo- and electrocatalytic water splitting are briefly summarized. The roles of MPQ(3) materials in different reaction systems are also discussed. Finally, the challenges related to and prospects of MPQ(3) materials are presented on the basis of the current developments.[GRAPHICS].									47	5	0	0	1	0	47			2311-6706	2150-5551		WOS:000443470100001	30393715	
J	Gericke, GS								Reactive oxygen species and related haem pathway components as possible epigenetic modifiers in neurobehavioural pathology								MEDICAL HYPOTHESES				66	1			92	99		10.1016/j.mehy.2005.07.031				2006	2006	The neuroendocrine response to stress utilizes several biocommunicative pathways which also play a role in neurodevelopmental plasticity. The mechanism of action of steroidal compounds includes DNA alteration by reactive oxygen species (ROS) arising through redox cycling of reactive hormone derivatives. ROS and reactive nitrogen species play a significant role in signaling networks affecting gene transcriptional regulation during normal as well as stress-induced responses. ROS-associated synaptic and regulatory region plasticity may have been important for normal brain evolution, but probably simultaneously lowered the threshold for inducing neuropathotogy. A shift from 'plasticity' to 'instability' is likely to be associated with the emergence of complex effects depending on the timing, duration and intensity of the ROS insult, and is suggested to include heritable epigenetic chromatin/regulatory region remodeling differentially influencing expression levels of significant neuropsychiatric genes and their variant alleles. Neurobehavioural disorder clinical manifestations have been linked with ROS effects. The concepts discussed here relate to ROS-associated instability of DNA regulatory region sequences and a proposal that it may play an important modifying role in brain and neurobehaviouratly related gene expression. Genes encoding key steps in mitochondrial, haem, iron and bilirubin ROS metabolic pathways have been used as examples to illustrate how ROS-modified regulatory networks could possibly alter the context within which (even ostensibly unrelated) neuropsychiatric gene candidates may sometimes be recruited. Furthermore, reactions of certain radicals release sufficient energy to generate UV-photons. DNA conformational changes accompanied by changes in photon emission suggest that functional neuroimaging findings probably reflect interaction on the level of ROS/biophoton/genome regulatory region domains rather than the signatures of individual neurobehavioural disorder candidate genes.

In this regard, magnetite (Fe3O4) based photocatalysts are found to be effective as a simple recyclable photocatalytic material, not only preventing the excessive use of catalyst, but also allowing easy recovery of the deactivated photocatalyst, making the process fruitful. Taking into account the cost factor and efficiency, plasmonic nanostructures of noble metal modified magnetite materials show significant promise. Here in this review, we focus on the recent progress related to plasmon-enhanced water splitting and pollutant degradation using magnetite based composite photocatalysts, mainly due to energetic electron driven photocatalysis. We have addressed different green strategies for designing Fe3O4 based composite photocatalysts and their modification with various noble metal nanoparticles, strengthening the interface coupling between Fe3O4 and noble metals. We also highlight a discussion of photodegradation and water reduction reactions on plasmonic-metal/Fe3O4 nanostructured photocatalysts and the SPR effect of noble metal NPs to enhance the photocatalytic activity of Fe3O4. Reviewing the recent significant advances on this topic may provide new opportunities for designing highly efficient, low cost nanostructured materials for the photodegradation of pollutants and the generation of energy.									66	2	0	0	9	0	67			2044-4753	2044-4761		WOS:000459893900002

These three compounds ((Zn-0.6(H-2)(0.4)W12O40)(Cu(2,2'-bipy)(H2O)](Cu (2,2'-bipy)(H2O)(2)) (Cu (2,2'-bipy)(H2O)3])(2)center dot 6H(2)O (1), (Me4N)(2){ZnW12O40[Cu(2,2'-bipy)(H2O)][Cu(2,2'-bipy)(H2O)(3)])center dot 5H(2)O (2), and ((Zn-0.5(H-2)(0.5)W12O40)[Cu(2,2'-bipy)][(Cu(2,2'-bipy)(H2O)][Cu(2,2'-bipy)(H2O)(2)))center dot 5H(2)O (3) have been structurally characterized by single-crystal X-ray diffraction. Compound 1 appears as a dimeric cluster structure, while compounds 2 and 3 appear as a 1D chain structure and a 2D network, respectively. The semiconducting properties of compounds 1-3 are different, which was demonstrated by band gap (E-g) and photocurrent response measurements. Compound 3 can efficiently catalyze the photooxidation of toluene to benzaldehyde with high selectivity using molecular oxygen as the oxidant component. Moreover, compound 3 was recycled and reused three times without significant degradation in conversion and selectivity. In addition, the mechanism of the photocatalytic reaction was also investigated.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1477-9226	1477-9234		WOS:000719494000001	34787158

Phenolic compounds are a class of aromatic compounds that are known BrC precursors. Inorganic nitrate is a ubiquitous component of atmospheric aerosols, clouds, and fog. The photolysis of inorganic nitrate in atmospheric aqueous phases generates a variety of reactive oxygen species and reactive nitrogen species that can facilitate the photooxidation of organic compounds to form BrC. In this study, we investigated the formation and evolution of BrC from the aqueous-phase photooxidation of guaiacol and 5-nitroguaiacol initiated by inorganic nitrate photolysis. Guaiacol and 5-nitroguaiacol are two water-soluble phenolic compounds that are commonly found in fossil fuel and biomass burning emissions. Upon illumination in the presence of sodium nitrate, guaiacol and 5-nitroguaiacol reacted rapidly to form BrC. The reaction rates and quantities of BrC formed depended on the initial sodium nitrate concentration. The reaction rates of guaiacol were substantially faster than those of 5-nitroguaiacol. The electron-withdrawing nitro functional group on 5-nitroguaiacol's aromatic ring likely had a deactivating effect on the ring's reactivity, which contributed to 5-nitroguaiacol's lower reactivity compared to guaiacol. The major products produced during the initial stages of photooxidation were formed by the addition of nitro and/or nitroso groups to guaiacol and 5-nitroguaiacol. These products likely strongly absorbed near-UV and/or visible light, which led to an observed increase in light absorption (i.e., photoenhancement) in the near-UV and visible range. Greater photo-enhancement was observed during the nitratemediated photooxidation of guaiacol. This indicated that the presence of nitro functional group(s) on the aromatic ring of phenolic compounds will impact the extent of photo-enhancement during BrC formation. Further photooxidation caused the initial products to fragment into smaller molecules that do not absorb near-UV and visible light. This resulted in an observed decrease in light absorption (i.e., photo-bleaching). These results highlight how aqueous-phase inorganic nitrate photolysis can drive the formation of BrC by facilitating the photooxidation of organic compounds.									11	1	0	0	4	0	12			1352-2310	1873-2844		WOS:000663368200001

This requires in situ studies to provide observables that contribute to both modeling beyond the phenomenological level and exactly transducing the functionally relevant quantities. A range of X-ray coherent diffraction imaging (CDI) approaches have recently been proposed for imaging beyond the diffraction limit with potentially dramatic improvements in time resolution with chemical sensitivity. In this paper, we report a selection of ptychography results obtained in situ during the electrodeposition of a metal-polymer nanocomposite. Our selection includes dynamic imaging during electrochemically driven growth complemented with absorption and phase spectroscopy with high lateral resolution. We demonstrate the onset of morphological instability feature formation and correlate the chemical state of Mn with the local growth rate controlled by the current density distribution resulting from morphological evolution.									8	0	0	0	0	0	8				2073-4360		WOS:000396471000015	30970694	
J	Marcus, RA								Mass-independent isotope effect in the earliest processed solids in the solar system: A possible chemical mechanism								JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL PHYSICS				121	17			8201	8211		10.1063/1.1803507				NOV 1 2004	2004	A major constraint is described for a possible chemical origin for the "mass-independent" oxygen isotope phenomenon in calcium-aluminum rich inclusions (CAIs) in meteorites at high temperatures (similar to1500-2000 K). A symmetry-based dynamical eta effect is postulated for O atom-monoxide recombination on the surface of growing CAIs. It is the surface analog of the volume-based eta effect occurring in a similar phenomenon for ozone in the gas phase [Y. Q. Gao, W. C. Chen, and R. A. Marcus, J. Chem. Phys. 117, 1536 (2002), and references cited therein]: In the growth of CAI grains an equilibrium is postulated between adsorbed species XO (ads)+O (ads)--> <--XO2* (ads), where XO2* (ads) is a vibrationally excited adsorbed dioxide molecule and X can be Si, Al, Ti, or other metals and can be C for minerals less refractory than the CAIs. The surface of a growing grain has an entropic effect of many order of magnitude on the position of this monoxide-dioxide equilibrium relative to its volume-based position by acting as a concentrator. The volume-based eta effect for ozone in the earlier study is not applicable to gas phase precursors of CAIs, due to the rarity of three-body recombination collisions at very low pressures and because of the high H-2 and H concentration in solar gas, which reduces gaseous O and gaseous dioxides and prevents the latter from acting as storage reservoirs for the two heavier oxygen isotopes. A surface eta effect yields XO2* (ads) that is mass-independently rich in O-17 and O-18, and yields XO (ads)+O (ads) that is mass-independently poor in the two heavier oxygen isotopes. When the XO2* (ads) is deactivated by vibrational energy loss to the grain, it has only one subsequent fate, evaporation, and so undergoes no further isotopic fractionation. After evaporation the XO2 again has only one fate, which is to react rapidly with H and ultimately form O-16-poor H2O. The other species, O (ads)+XO (ads), are O-16 rich and react with Ca (ads) and other adsorbed metal atoms or metallic monoxides to form CAIs. The latter are thereby mass-independently poor in O-17 and O-18. Some O (ads) used to form the minerals are necessarily in excess of the XO (ads), because of the stoichiometry of the mineral, and modify the fractionation pattern. This effect is incorporated into the mechanistic and mathematical scheme. A merit of this chemical mechanism for the oxygen isotope anomaly is that only one oxygen reservoir is required in the solar nebula. It also does not require a sequestering of intermediate products which could undergo isotopic exchange, hence undoing the original isotopic fractionations. The gas phase source of adsorbed O atoms in this environment is either O or H2O. As inferred from data on the evaporation of Mg2SiO4 taken as an example, the source of O (ads) is primarily H2O rather than O and is accompanied by the evolution of H-2. Nonisotopic kinetic experiments can determine more sharply the mechanism of condensed phase growth of these minerals. Laboratory tests are proposed to test the existence of a surface eta effect on the growing CAI surfaces at these high temperatures.

However, the fundamental nature of their active Ni sites remains controversial, since the typically proposed pyridinic-type Ni configurations are inactive, display low selectivity, and/or possess an unfavorable formation energy. Herein, we present a constant-potential first-principles and microkinetic model to study the CO2RR at a solid-water interface, which shows that the electrode potential is crucial for governing CO2 activation. A formation energy analysis on several NiNxC4-x (x = 1-4) moieties indicates that the predominant Ni moieties of Ni-N-C SACs are expected to have a formula of NiN4. After determining the potential-dependent thermodynamic and kinetic energy of these Ni moieties, we discover that the energetically favorable pyrrolic-type NiN4 moiety displays high activity for facilitating the selective CO2RR over the competing H-2 evolution. Moreover, model polarization curves and Tafel analysis results exhibit reasonable agreement with existing experimental data. This work highlights the intrinsic tetrapyrrolic coordination of Ni for facilitating the CO2RR and offers practical guidance for the rational improvement of SACs, and this model can be expanded to explore mechanisms of other electrocatalysis in aqueous solutions.									12	0	0	0	0	0	12			2041-6520	2041-6539		WOS:000706798000001	34760190

In this perspective, a computer program is designed, efficient in time and space, is used to solve the system of fluid dynamic classical equations based on the resolution of the Boltzmann equation. It participates also, in the chemical kinetics of the gas including the equations of continuity, momentum and energy. For numerical resolution, the flux-corrected transport method is applied successfully to electric discharge, and the generated species of pure gas O-2 kinetics are obtained. The reactivity of the gas takes into account nine species that interact according to 23 reactions selected in a way calculated to favor the most dominant. The chosen reduced field values are 100, 120, 140,160, 180 and 200 Td. The results obtained show an evolution closely related to the reduced electric field, and the production of ozone is accompanied by the appearance and disappearance of other species.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			2523-3963	2523-3971		WOS:000532826500183

The diamagnetic complex [Ni-II(psnet)](BF4)(2) was prepared and reduced to [Ni-I(psnet)](BF4) with NaBH4 in THF (psnet = bis(5-(diphenylphosphino)-3-thiapentanyl)amine). Both complexes were structurally characterized by X-ray diffraction. [Ni(psnet)](1+) was demonstrated to be an authentic Ni(I) complex with a ...(d(z2))(1) ground state. Under appropriate conditions, [Ni(psnet)](+) reacts with acids in nonaqueous media to give near-quantitative yields of H-2 according to the stoichiometry Ni-I + H+ --> Ni-II + 1/2H(2). Dihydrogen production was demonstrated to be directly related to Ni(I) oxidation. The reaction system [Ni(psnet)](+)/HCl/DMF, which gives H-2 yields of greater than or similar to 90%, was subjected to a kinetics analysis. The overall reaction [Ni(psnet)](+) + HCl --> [Ni(psnet)Cl](+) + 1/2H(2) proceeds by two parallel pathways dependent on chloride concentration. Addition of Bu(4)NCl accelerates the reaction, whereas (Bu(4)N)(PF6) decreases the rate. A two-term rate law is presented which includes contributions from both pathways, whose common initial step is protonation of Ni(I). Path A (low chloride concentration) involves the formation and collapse of nickel hydride chloride ion pairs; the rate-determining step is the minimal reaction 2Ni(III) - H- --> H-2 + 2Ni(II). Path B (high chloride concentration) includes as the rate-limiting step collapse of a nickel hydride dichloride ion pair followed by the bimolecular reaction of two Ni-III - H- intermediates or reduction to Ni-II - H- by Ni-I followed by protonation of the hydride. The relation of these results to the reactions of hydrogenase enzymes is considered.									64	0	0	0	9	0	65			0020-1669			WOS:A1996UY21800009	11666623	
B	Lefkowitz, J.K.								Plasma-Assisted Combustion: Fundamental Studies and Engine Applications								Plasma-Assisted Combustion: Fundamental Studies and Engine Applications								312 pp	312 pp						2016	2016	Summary form only given. Successful and efficient ignition in short residence time environments or ultra-lean mixtures is a key technological challenge for the evolution of advanced combustion devices in terms of both performance and efficiency. To meet this challenge, interest in plasma assisted combustion (PAC) has expanded over the past 20 years. However, understanding of the underlying physical processes of ignition by plasma discharge remains elementary. In order to shed light on the key processes involved, two main thrusts of research were undertaken in this dissertation. First, demonstration of the applicability of plasma discharges in engines and engine-like environments was carried out using a microwave discharge and a nanosecond repetitively pulsed discharge in an internal combustion engine and a pulsed detonation engine, respectively. Major conclusions include the extension of lean ignition limits for both engines, significant reduction of ignition time for mixtures with large minimum ignition energy, and the discovery of the inter-pulse coupling effect of nanosecond repetitively pulsed (NRP) discharges at high frequency. In order to understand the kinetic processes that led to these improvements, the second thrust of research directly explored the chemical kinetic processes of plasma discharges with hydrocarbon fuels. For this purpose, a low pressure flow reactor with a NRP dielectric barrier discharge cell was assembled. The discharge cell was fitted with a Herriott type multipass mirror arrangement, which allowed quantitative laser absorption spectroscopy to be performed in situ during the plasma discharge. Experiments on methane and ethylene mixtures with oxygen, argon, and helium revealed the importance of low temperature oxidation pathways in PAC. In particular, oxygen addition reactions were shown to be of primary importance in the oxidation of these small hydrocarbons in the temperature range of 300-600 K. Kinetic modeling tools, including both a coupled plasma and combustion chemistry solver and appropriate reaction models, were developed and compared to the experimental results, revealing excellent agreement for major fuel consumption pathways, but significant disagreement in the predictions of smaller concentration products. The individual reactions responsible for the observed disagreements were identified, and directions for further research are discussed.									0	0	0		0	0	0					978-13-394-6847-1	INSPEC:16316546

Herein, we report a nickel foam (NF) supported Co-VOx-P nanoflower electrocatalyst that shows excellent catalytic performances, achieving a small over potential of 230 mV at 100 mA/cm(2) for OER. Such performances surpass the recently reported best-performing Co-based catalysts in alkaline media. In addition, the present Co-VOx-P electrocatalyst can deliver 10 mA/cm(2) with a small overpotential of 98 mV for HER. Experimental and DFT studies indicate that, due to the combination of P and V, the Co-VOx-P electrocatalyst shows improved intrinsic catalytic properties including enhanced conductivity, facile electron transfer and favorable surface adsorption strength. The strategy demonstrated here by incorporating metalloid with high valence states may be extended to design other cost-efficient electrocatalysts for more advanced water splitting performances.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000787898700004

However, the knowledge regarding the active centers remains piecemeal and unclear, such as how the redox metal centers of B site, inert metals of A site, oxygen vacancies, and direct oxidation of catalysts govern the chemical degradation of aqueous pollutants. This study aimed to identify principal alternations in physicochemical and electrical properties of ABO(3)-based perovskites modified with partial/overall substitution at A/B sites and synthesized at different conditions. In order to probe varied catalytic activity of these catalysts, ofloxacin (OFX) was used as a model micro-pollutant. Results showed that the OFX degradation by activation of peroxymonosulfate (PMS) with LaFeO3 perovskite was favored by the Sr substitution at A site, Cu substitution at B site, and increasing calcination temperature. Evolution of O-1(2), (OH)-O-center dot and SO4 center dot- have proven for efficient OFX oxidation, as evidenced by results from in-situ electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) analyses and quenching tests. Specifically, the introduction of Sr at A site can facilitate PMS self-decomposition to produce more O-1(2) due to the increased abundance of surface oxygen vacancies. In contrast, the Cu substitution at B site improved the surface oxygen vacancies, as well as the electrical conductivity, which can further accelerate (OH)-O-center dot and SO4 center dot- generation for the OFX degradation. This study provides deeper insights into the underlying mechanisms governing the catalytic activity of perovskites. These findings build a basis for better decontamination of hazardous environmental organic pollutants.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0304-3894	1873-3336		WOS:000711685700004	34879575

The reduction of Mn ions in PSII(-Ca,4Mn) by Fe(II) and the concomitant release of two Mn(II) cations is accompanied by the binding of newly generated Fe(III) in at least one vacated Mn site. Flash-induced chlorophyll (Chl) fluorescence yield measurements of this new 2Mn/nFe cluster (PSII[-Ca,2Mn,nFe]) show that charge recombination in the presence of 3-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-1,1-dimethylurea (DCMU) occurs between Q(a) (-) and the remaining Mn/Fe cluster (but not Y-Z (au)) in the OEC, and extraction of 2 Mn occurs uniformly in all PSII complexes. No O-2 evolution is observed, but the heteronuclear metal cluster in PSII(-Ca,2Mn,nFe) samples is still able to supply electrons for reduction of the exogenous electron acceptor, 2,6-dichlorophrenolindophenol, by photooxidizing water and producing H2O2 in the absence of an exogenous donor as seen previously with PSII(-Ca,4Mn). Selective extraction of Mn or Fe cations from the 2Mn/nFe heteronuclear cluster demonstrates that the high-affinity Mn-binding site is occupied by one of the iron cations. It is notable that partial water-oxidation function still occurs when only two Mn cations are present in the PSII OEC.									7	0	1	0	8	0	10			0145-479X	1573-6881		WOS:000377022700005	26847716

The intrinsic role of oxygenic species on photocatalytic activity in g-C(3)N(4)has been intensively studied, but it is still not fully explored. Herein, the essential relationships between oxygenic functionalities and the catalytic performance are revealed. Results demonstrate that C-O-C functionality as an electron trap could help to increase the resistance of conduction transfer (R-ct) by limiting electrons transfer in CNx. In contrast, N-C-O functionality between different tri-s-triazine unites could promote the electrons transfer, leading to a reducedR(ct)in CNx. The best H(2)production rate (3.70 mmol h(-1) g(-1), 12.76-fold higher than that of CN) is obtained over CN3, because of the highest N-C-O ratio (r(N-C-O)). The apparent quantum efficiency (AQE) of CN3 at 405 nm, 420 nm, 450 nm, 500 nm and 550 nm is 33.90 %, 20.88 %, 8.25 %, 3.66 % and 1.01 %, respectively.									17	1	0	0	1	0	17			1864-5631	1864-564X		WOS:000554666800001	32662925

While macroscopic consequences are known, the underlying nanoscopic mechanisms are not fully elucidated. By coupling X-ray spectroscopy with several X-ray microscopy modalities, we have spatially resolved the extent of Ni oxidation at several states of charge and uncovered heterogeneity that is hidden when considering ensemble measurements alone. The use of morphologically controlled particles enabled high-resolution imaging of these materials, uncovering gradients of Ni oxidation states within individual primary particles. At high states of charge, these gradients revealed regions of possible oxygen deficiency extending deeper into the particle than previously observed. Surface-sensitive X-ray coupled scanning tunneling microscopy allows oxidation states to be measured at the material's surface, showing predominantly Ni-II in the first atomic layer and mixtures of Ni-II with Ni-III/Ni-IV already appearing 1.5 nm into the particle. These results reveal the subtle interplay between irreversible surface transformations and the bulk reactions that ultimately define function, which will refine strategies of surface passivation that are key to overcoming current performance limitations.									4	1	0	0	0	0	5			0897-4756	1520-5002		WOS:000557753300024

Synthetic protocols based on wet techniques are available and are based on the decomposition of the organic layer decorating the nanoparticles. For nickel, the phosphine of choice is trioctylphosphine, and this leads to the formation of NiPx, materials. However, the temperature at which the decomposition starts has been found to depend on the quality of the nickel surface. Density functional theory, DFT, holds the key to analyze the initial steps of the formation of these phosphide materials. We have found how clean nickel surfaces, either (111) or (100), readily breaks the ligand P-C bonds. This triggers the process that leads to the replacement of a surface nickel atom by P and concomintantly forms a Ni adatom on the surface surrounded by two methyl groups, thus starting the formation of the NiPx, phase. The whole process requires low energies, in agreement with the low temperature found in the experiments, 150 degrees C. In contrast, if the surface is oxidized, the reaction does not proceed at low temperatures and oxygen vacancies need to be created first to start the P-C bond breaking on the Ni-clean patches. Our results show that the cleaner the surface is, the milder the reactions are required for the NiPx formation, and thus they pave the way for gentler synthetic protocols that can improve the control of these materials.									10	0	0	0	0	0	10			1520-6106	1520-5207		WOS:000423140600034	28880556

Electrocatalysts with the superhigh current density (1000 mA cm(-2)-level) and long-term durability (over 1000 h), especially at low overpotentials (<300 mV), seem extremely critical for green hydrogen from experiment to industrialization. Along the way, numerous innovative ideas are proposed to design high efficiency electrocatalysts in line with industrial requirements, which also stimulates the understanding of the mass/charge transfer and mechanical stability during the electrochemical process. It is of great necessity to summarize and sort out the accumulating knowledge in time for the development of laboratory to commercial use in this promising field. This review begins with examining the theoretical principles of achieving high-efficiency electrocatalysts with high current densities and excellent durability. Special attention is paid to acquaint efficient strategies to design perfect electrocatalysts including atomic structure regulation for electrical conductivity and reaction energy barrier, array configuration constructing for mass transfer process, and multiscale coupling for high mechanical strength. Finally, the importance and the personal perspective on future opportunities and challenges, is highlighted.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			1613-6810	1613-6829		WOS:000703016100001	34605154

Response of chlorophyll d-containing cyanobacterium Acaryochloris marina to UV and visible irradiations								PHOTOSYNTHESIS RESEARCH				117	1-3	SI		497	507		10.1007/s11120-013-9946-7				NOV 2013	2013	We have previously investigated the response mechanisms of photosystem II complexes from spinach to strong UV and visible irradiations (Wei et al J Photochem Photobiol B 104:118-125, 2011). In this work, we extend our study to the effects of strong light on the unusual cyanobacterium Acaryochloris marina, which is able to use chlorophyll d (Chl d) to harvest solar energy at a longer wavelength (740 nm). We found that ultraviolet (UV) or high level of visible and near-far red light is harmful to A. marina. Treatment with strong white light (1,200 mu mol quanta m(-2) s(-1)) caused a parallel decrease in PSII oxygen evolution of intact cells and in extracted pigments Chl d, zeaxanthin, and alpha-carotene analyzed by high-performance liquid chromatography, with severe loss after 6 h. When cells were irradiated with 700 nm of light (100 mu mol quanta m(-2) s(-1)) there was also bleaching of Chl d and loss of photosynthetic activity. Interestingly, UVB radiation (138 mu mol quanta m(-2) s(-1)) caused a loss of photosynthetic activity without reduction in Chl d. Excess absorption of light by Chl d (visible or 700 nm) causes a reduction in photosynthesis and loss of pigments in light harvesting and photoprotection, likely by photoinhibition and inactivation of photosystem II, while inhibition of photosynthesis by UVB radiation may occur by release of Mn ion(s) in Mn4CaO5 center in photosystem II.									5	0	0	0	5	1	5			0166-8595	1573-5079		WOS:000326604900036	24158260

The role of L-cysteine (Cys) on AA degradation was also studied. T, MC, and t were the main independent variables or factors affecting AA and DKG during post packaging storage. Similar pattern of AA degradation was observed in all products. Changes of AA during storage followed zero-order reaction kinetics. AA retention was higher (> 68 %) in those foods stored under refrigeration. Statistically significant relationship was estimated between time when maximum DKG was determined and T. Strong and moderately strong relationships were found between AA and Cys in 36 total trials at the 90 % or higher confidence level. Decreasing Cys promoted DKG formation and loss of biological activity and health benefits. Based on AA retention, a significant reduction of shelf life was determined for all products. Significance and implication of Cys supplementation of foods for infants and young children is discussed.									6	0	0	0	4	0	6			2214-2894			WOS:000529922400011

We explore the Li1.33-x/3Ru0.66-2x/3CoxO2 series (in the solid solution notation (x)LiCoO2-(1-x)Li2RuO3) for x <= 0.4 by partial substitution of Co+3 for both Ru+4 and Li+ in the metal layer; in this way, creation of oxygen non-stoichiometry is avoided. Powder XRD reveals that an increase in the cobalt content in the series leads to a structural transformation from monoclinic to rhombohedral phase, owing to increased cation disorder in the metal layer. Cyclic voltammetric scans shows clear evidence for decreased oxygen evolution for Co-substituted samples. The x=0.3 member delivers an initial discharge capacity of about 232 mAh g(-1) and, after the 100(th) cycle, 85 % capacity retention is observed. Furthermore, the rate capability is also significantly improved by Co substitution. Li+ removal during the first charge is more than expected by counting on cation oxidation alone, demonstrating the participation of anion redox. Interestingly, the x=0.2 and 0.3 members of the series Li1.33-x/3Ru0.66-2x/3CoxO2 show better Li reversibility upon long-term cycling, endorsing the beneficial effect of Co+3 in stabilizing the layered structure during electrochemical cycling.									11	1	0	0	0	0	11			2196-0216			WOS:000513102700042

Sintering is a key step in fabricating MIEC composite cathode to form interconnected networks for gas transport and electron/ion conduction. However, the sintering process of MIEC composite electrodes has rarely been studied and thus not well understood. In this study, an enhanced kinetic Monte Carlo (KMC) model is proposed to study the microstructure evolution of the composite MIEC electrodes. The key microstructural properties such as average particle size, pore size, porosity, tortuosity, effective surface area and effective three-phase boundary (TPB) length are comprehensively extracted from the reconstructed electrode by a series of the estimation algorithm. A backpropagation artificial neural network (ANN) is established for the quick prediction of micro properties during the sintering process. Besides, a global sensitivity analysis approach based on the elementary effects method is applied to assess the sensitivity degree of structural and operating parameters while Kolmogorov-Smirnov test is conducted to ensure the reliability of the sampling strategy (P-value >> .05). By considering the time evolution within the ANN surrogate model, this study firstly explores the coupling parametric effects of the KMC model at different sintering stages. The initial sintering stage (KMC steps <1000) is found to be the dominant section throughout the sintering procedure due to higher initial system free energy. Tortuosity and porosity show the most significant influence on the formation of effective surface and TPB reaction sites. Large tortuosity and small porosity favor the formation of effective surface reaction area but adversely hinder the gas transport at the same time. Free energy and sintering temperature are the determining factors in the sintering process. Even though grain growth and pore migration frequency show almost the same importance, their influence on the different output factors is quite different. This study establishes a qualitative framework to gain an essential perception about how the sintering process influences the micro properties of the electrode thereby efficiently guiding the sintering control and microstructure design. Highlights A kinetic Monte Carlo model is established considering sintering kinetics. A BP-ANN method is proposed for quick prediction of micro-characteristics An elementary effects approach is employed to perform global sensitivity analysis. Decisive role of initial powder fabrication on the sintering process is emphasized Porosity and tortuosity play the most significant effects than other structural factors.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0363-907X	1099-114X		WOS:000757281600001

Organic photocatalysts, while attractive because of their synthetic tunability, tend to have low quantum efficiencies for water splitting. Here we present a crystalline covalent organic framework (COF) based on a benzobis(benzothiophene sulfone) moiety that shows a much higher activity for photochemical hydrogen evolution than its amorphous or semicrystalline counterparts. The COF is stable under long-term visible irradiation and shows steady photochemical hydrogen evolution with a sacrificial electron donor for at least 50 hours. We attribute the high quantum efficiency of fusedsulfone-COF to its crystallinity, its strong visible light absorption, and its wettable, hydrophilic 3.2 nm mesopores. These pores allow the framework to be dye-sensitized, leading to a further 61% enhancement in the hydrogen evolution rate up to 16.3 mmol g(-1) h(-1). The COF also retained its photocatalytic activity when cast as a thin film onto a support.									533	26	0	0	44	0	533			1755-4330	1755-4349		WOS:000450790300005	30275507

Carbonate ions in the membrane which are strongly adsorbing anions; suppress both HOR and MOR kinetics. Carbonate ions not only have a site blocking effect, but at low pHs sufficient amount of hydroxyl ions are not available for adsorption. Adsorption effects by the quaternary ammonium species in the membrane, on the Pt electrode is found to be minimal. However, an ionomer film (AS4) coated on the membrane, significantly decreased the rate of HOR. Diffusion of hydrogen molecules through the membrane was not influenced by the carbonate ions due to the smaller size of the gaseous molecule. However, hydrogen concentration in the anion exchange membrane is low in the presence of carbonate ions. Methanol diffusion is facilitated in the anion exchange polymer electrolyte due to its high water content. However, change of the diffusion path length in carbonate polymer electrolytes caused methanol permeability to drop significantly. (C) The Author(s) 2019.

In particular, the activity of Co3O4 prepared through annealing always gets inferior compared to its amorphous precursor. This demands the development of synthetic techniques to prepare Co3O4 with superior activity as the unpredictable crystal structure of the amorphous materials makes it difficult to understand their structure-activity relationships despite higher geometric activity. In this article, we have shown that incorporation of sulfate in pre-annealed materials plays a pivotal role in boosting the OER activity of annealed Co3O4 irrespective of the pre-annealed phase. In contrast to commonly used nitrate or carbonate that leaves the structure upon annealing and renders the resulting Co3O4 with poor activity, sulfate remains in the annealed structure due to its thermal stability and causes a dramatic enhancement in the geometric electrocatalytic OER activity of resulting Co3O4 compared to the pre-annealed phase. This was due to the "pore-alteration ability" and "crystallization hindrance effect" of sulfate ions that significantly alter the microstructure of the resulting Co3O4 during annealing process by dramatically improving the surface area, pore size, and pore volume. Moreover, sulfate incorporation provided structures with considerably higher mesoporosity that is known to be conducive for reactant and product diffusion within the network. The improved textural properties led to better exposure of the catalytic centres to the electrolyte leading to higher geometric OER activity despite identical intrinsic activity of both sulfate free and incorporated Co3O4 as confirmed from their specific activities. Further, the Co3O4 synthesized by annealing sulfate incorporated precursor was found to be rich with oxygen defects that are known to increase the potency of a material towards electrocatalytic OER. The sulfate ions also etched out in the electrolyte during electrocatalysis leading to complete unblocking of the pores thereby helping in sustaining the high geometric OER activity. To our knowledge, this is the first report where the geometric electrocatalytic OER activity of an annealed Co3O4 is significantly better compared to its pre-annealed phase and is in fact comparable to the activity of amorphous Co-hydroxide based compounds.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			1861-4728	1861-471X		WOS:000631162800001	33667035

The evolution of the kinetic constants of the hybrid biomass and organic matter removal were studied in a pilot plant under different operational conditions, by varying hydraulic retention time (HRT), mixed liquor suspended solids (MLSS) and temperature, and considering the attached biomass of the carrier and the dispersed biomass of the flocs to reproduce real treatment conditions. The rates of organic matter removal were 97.73 +/- A 0.81 % of biochemical oxygen demand (BOD5), 93.44 +/- A 2.13 % of chemical oxygen demand (COD), 94.41 +/- A 2.26 % of BOD5 and 87.62 +/- A 2.47 % of COD using 24.00 +/- A 0.39 and 10.00 +/- A 0.07 h of HRT, respectively. The influence of the environmental variables and operational conditions on kinetic constants was studied; it was determined that the most influential variable for the decay coefficient for heterotrophic biomass was HRT (0.34 +/- A 0.14 and 0.31 +/- A 0.10 days(-1) with 10.00 +/- A 0.07 and 24.00 +/- A 0.39 h of HRT, respectively), while for heterotrophic biomass yield, this was temperature (0.61 +/- A 0.04 and 0.52 +/- A 0.06 with 10.00 +/- A 0.07 and 24.00 +/- A 0.39 h of HRT, respectively). The results show that introducing carriers in an MBR system provides similar results for organic matter removal, but with a lower concentration of MLSS.									10	2	0	0	2	0	12			1735-1472	1735-2630		WOS:000338118100026

Despite inherently fast photocarrier decay in neat 2D TMDCs, the unique photophysics in these quantum-confined systems motivates continued effort to control the evolution of photoexcited states and create functional devices. An intriguing strategy to accomplish this goal is to employ TMDCs in heterojunctions with appropriate semiconductors, where energy level offsets drive photoinduced charge transfer (PCT) across material interfaces. PCT in TMDC-based systems can be optimized for many different applications, such as driving free carriers to photocatalytic sites for redox reactions like water splitting, extracting charge to perform work in photovoltaics or photodetectors, and manipulating the spin and momentum valley electronic degrees of freedom for quantum computing systems. Here, we review recent strides in optimizing PCT for such applications through greater fundamental understanding of the photophysics that occurs at TMDC/semiconductor interfaces. After giving an overview of isolated TMDC properties, synthetic methods, and the basics of PCT, we discuss TMDCs in heterojunctions with several classes of materials, including other TMDCs, small molecule semiconductors, polymers, single-walled carbon nanotubes, quantum dots, perovskites, and electrolytes. In addition to highlighting the unique benefits of each materials category, we also identify parallels across common themes, such as the roles of charge-transfer states, spin, electronic coupling, delocalization, interfacial atomic morphology, and the precise design of energy landscapes to direct charge and energy motion. We hope to capture a broad range of the valuable work in this fast-paced field to inspire new research directions for employing PCT in targeted TMDC-based systems.									34	0	0	0	2	0	34			1754-5692	1754-5706		WOS:000570224500004

In this work, cuprous oxide (Cu2O) was supported on N-doped flexible roughed graphite paper (NGP) to fabricate Cu2O/NGP self-supporting electrocatalysts for CO(2)RRs by electrodeposition and heat treatment. In the Cu2O/NGP electrocatalyst, NGP acted as a current collector and conducting channel, which can effectively transfer electrons from the active sites of Cu2O to NGP, and thus, enhance the catalytic performance of Cu2O/NGP for CO(2)RRs. The overall Faradaic efficiency of Cu2O/NGP for CO(2)RRs reached 96% at -0.9 V vs. reversible hydrogen electrode, of which 35% originated from yielding ethylene (C2H4), suggesting its high activity and C2H4 selectivity. Furthermore, the excellent stability of Cu2O/NGP over 10 h made it preferable as an effective electrocatalyst for CO(2)RRs. The good electrocatalytic performance could be attributed to the unique self-supporting structure and the synergetic effect between Cu2O and NGP.									2	0	0	0	1	0	2			2044-4753	2044-4761		WOS:000697469900001

The role of different transition metal and structure-activity relationships were systematically investigated by advanced techniques including Synchrotron XAFS and in situ DRIFTs analysis. The excellent activity of Co-MnO x was related to its unique Mn-enriched surface (Co2+)tet(Mn3+ Co3+)octO(4) structure with Mn cations occupying the octahedral sites, which is superior to the Ni-MnOx and Cu-MnOx with Mn-lean surface. In addition, the reaction energy barrier of Co-MnOx is weakened due to the lower electron cloud density around the Mn atom as compared to Ni-MnOx and Cu-MnOx . Moreover, Co-MnOx benefiting from the rapid electron migration between Mn and Co, more active bidentate/bridged nitrates could react with adsorbed NH 3 in faster reaction rates following the L-H mechanism.									19	2	0	0	1	0	21			0304-3894	1873-3336		WOS:000647728600004	33930946

X-Ray crystal structure analyses reveal that they have a rich structural chemistry. Three distinct structure types were exhibited with decreasing lanthanide radii: [LnCu(ina)(2)(C2O4)](H2O)-H-. (Ln = La 1, Pr 2, Nd 3) for type I, [Ln(ina)(C2O4)(H2O)2] (Ln = Sm 4, Eu 5, Gd 6) for type II, and [Ln(ina)(C2O4)(0.5)(OH)] ( Ln = Tb 7, Dy 8, Er 9) for type III. The structure of type I has a 3d-4f heterometallic structure and consists of 1D channels along the b axis, which filled with guest water molecules. They exhibit a first 3D uninodal eight-connected framework with a unique 3(6.)4(18.)5(3.)6 topology. Type II has 2D Ln-ina-C2O4 4(4)-nets, the nitrogen donors of the ina ligand are not coordinated to any of the metal ions, inducing the lower dimensional networks. Type III consists of 2D Ln-C2O4 layers pillared by ina ligands to form a pillared-layer framework. The structure evolution is due to the versatile coordination modes of ina and oxalate ligands as well as the lanthanide contraction effect. Notably, the oxalate ligand was in situ synthesized from orotic acid through an oxidation-hydrolysis reaction. The type III materials show high thermal stability; luminescence properties of Nd 3, Sm 4, Eu 5, Tb 7 are also investigated.									125	5	1	0	2	0	128			1477-9226	1477-9234		WOS:000249345600011	17828367

Effects of grain morphology, microstructure and dispersed metal cocatalyst on the photoreduction of water over impurity-doped LaInO3								MATERIALS RESEARCH BULLETIN				47	5			1217	1228		10.1016/j.materresbull.2012.01.031				MAY 2012	2012	The single phase lanthanum indates doped with Ga (for La) and N (for O), i.e. La1-xGaxInO3 (0 <= x <= 0.2) and LaInO1-yNy (y similar to 0.6), exhibit significant activity for photoreduction of water; the yield of H-2 produced depending on dopant, excitation source, and addition of a sacrificial reagent. The two-step H-2 evolution observed for this reaction corresponds with the two distinct absorbance regimes displayed by these materials, one in UV-region due to bandgap excitation and the other in visible region arising from the transitions involving sub-bandgap donor or acceptor energy states. The photocatalytic activity of these d(10) metal oxides increases on coating with a metal/metal oxide co-catalyst, gold exhibiting superior activity to Pt and NiO, irrespective of excitation source and sample composition. The preparation-controlled particle morphology, doping-induced lattice imperfections, and metal/semiconductor hetero-junctions are envisaged to play a key role in the absorption characteristics and photocatalytic water reduction activity of metal/LaInO3 nanocomposites.

J	Woosley, SE								Neutron-rich nucleosynthesis in carbon deflagration supernovae								ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL				476	2			801	810		10.1086/303650				FEB 20 1997	1997	Accreting carbon-oxygen white dwarfs approaching the Chandrasekhar mass may provide a substantial fraction of Type Ia supernovae. The hydrodynamics of nuclear burning in these models remains uncertain, but all current models are characterized by an initial period of slow, nearly laminar flame propagation at a well-known conductive speed. For cold white dwarfs and slow accretion, the density at the center of the white dwarf at ignition may be quite high, extending perhaps beyond the highest value allowed before accretion-induced collapse occurs, similar to 9 x 10(9) g cm(-3). The nucleosynthesis that occurs in stars slightly below this critical value, specifically rho(c) = 2-8 x 10(9) g cm(-3), is explored here using a large nuclear reaction network that allows the resulting abundances of neutron-rich nuclei in the mass range 12-90 to be- determined accurately for realistic models of the explosion. It is found that these explosions are responsible for producing the solar abundances of Ca-48, Ti-50, Cr-54, and Zn-70, With appreciable contributions to Fe-58, Ni-64, Zn-66, Ge-76, Se-82, and the gamma-astronomy candidate, Fe-60. Provided a prompt detonation does not occur, these results are insensitive to the physics of flame propagation after the first few hundredths of a solar mass has burned. They are, however, mildly sensitive to the ignition density and uncertain weak interaction rates below Y-e approximate to 0.42. Since these nuclei, especially Ca-48, cannot be produced anywhere else in nature, the results show that Chandrasekhar mass explosions must occasionally occur (an event rate about 2% of the observed Type Ia supernova rate is estimated for these higher density explosions); however, most Type Ia supernovae must ignite at an appreciably lower density, 2 x 10(9) g cm(-3). Implications for gamma-ray astronomy and meteorite anomalies are briefly discussed.									99	1	0	0	0	0	99			0004-637X			WOS:A1997WH85800030		
J	Babikov, Dmitri								Recombination reactions as a possible mechanism of mass-independent fractionation of sulfur isotopes in the Archean atmosphere of Earth								PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA				114	12			3062	3067		10.1073/pnas.1620977114				MAR 21 2017	2017	A hierarchy of isotopically substituted recombination reactions is formulated for production of sulfur allotropes in the anoxic atmosphere of Archean Earth. The corresponding system of kinetics equations is solved analytically to obtain concise expressions for isotopic enrichments, with focus on massindependent isotope effects due to symmetry, ignoring smaller mass-dependent effects. Proper inclusion of atom-exchange processes is shown to be important. This model predicts significant and equal depletions driven by reaction stoichiometry for all rare isotopes: S-33, S-34, and S-36. Interestingly, the ratio of capital. values obtained within this model for S-33 and S-36 is -1.16, very close to the mass-independent fractionation line of the Archean rock record. This model may finally offer a mechanistic explanation for the striking mass-independent fractionation of sulfur isotopes that took place in the Archean atmosphere of Earth.									24	1	0	0	6	0	25			0027-8424			WOS:000396893600050	28258172	
J	Zaky, Amr M.; Chaplin, Brian P.								Mechanism of p-Substituted Phenol Oxidation at a Ti4O7 Reactive Electrochemical Membrane								ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY				48	10			5857	5867		10.1021/es5010472				MAY 20 2014	2014	This research investigated the removal mechanisms of p-nitrophenol, p-methoxyphenol, and p-benzoquinone at a porous Ti4O7 reactive electrochemical membrane (REM) under anodic polarization. Cross-flow filtration experiments and density functional theory (DFT) calculations indicated that p:benzoquinone removal was primarily due to reaction with electrochemically formed OH center dot, while the dominant removal mechanism of p-nitrophenol and p-methoxyphenol was a function of the anodic potential. At low anodic potentials (1.7-1.8 V/SHE), p-nitrophenol and p-methoxyphenol were removed primarily by an electrochemical adsorption/polymerization mechanism on the REM. Increasing anodic potentials (1.9-3.2 V/SHE) resulted in the electroassisted adsorption mechanism contributing far less to p-methoxyphenol removal compared to p-nitrophenol. DFT calculations indicated that an increase in anodic potential resulted in a shift in p-methoxyphenol removal from a 1e(-) direct electron transfer (DET) reaction that resulted in radical formation and significant adsorption/polymerization, to a 2e(-) DET reaction that formed nonadsorbing products (i.e., p-benzoquinone). However, the anodic potentials were too low for the 2e(-) DET reaction to be thermodynamically favorable for p-nitrophenol. The decreased COD adsorption for p-nitrophenol at higher anodic potentials was attributed to reaction of soluble/adsorbed organics with OH center dot. These results provide the first mechanistic explanation for p-substituted phenolic compound removal during advanced electrochemical oxidation processes.									123	6	0	0	66	0	129			0013-936X	1520-5851		WOS:000336415200061	24766505

Au is regarded as an efficient catalyst for electrochemical reduction of CO2 to CO, and the introduction of Pd can tune CO2RR properties due to its strong affinity to CO. Herein, Au-Pd bimetallic electrocatalysts with different metal ratio were firstly investigated on CO2RR mechanism by using density functional theory. The Au monolayer over Pd substrate and single Pd atom on Au(111) were found to show better CO2RR selectivity against hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Based on this, various single-atom catalysts on Au(111) and core-shell models with top Au monolayer were designed to study their CO2RR performance. The results indicated that Pt, Cu, and Rh substrates below Au monolayer could enhance the activity and selectivity for CO production compared to pure Au, in which the limiting potential reduced from -0.74 to -0.63, -0.69, and -0.71 V, respectively. The single Pd embedded on Au(111) could adjust the adsorption strength, which provided an effective site to receive and further reduce CO to CH3OH and CH4 at a low limiting potential of -0.61 V, and also avoided catalyst poisoning due to the over-strengthened CO adsorption caused by high Pd proportion on the surface. In addition, the adsorption energy of COOH was observed as a better CO2RR reactivity descriptor than the common CO adsorption when establishing scaling relationship, which could avoid the fitting error caused by intermediate physisorption of CO.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			1864-5631	1864-564X		WOS:000649802900001	33931946

We have monitored the evolution of the pH at various discharge current densities in situ in the Mg-air primary cells, which produce sparingly soluble magnesium hydroxide (Mg(OH)(2)). These experiments show the temporal evolution of the pH of the electrolyte in the cell discharge, depending on the current density. The pH first increases rapidly to a maximum of pH 11 and then drops down slowly to the equilibrium at pH 10.7. At the peak pH oversaturation of Mg(OH)(2) is paramount, leading to the precipitation which balances the Mg(OH)(2) concentration in the electrolyte. This precipitation process coats both cathode and anode which leads to a decrease in cell efficiency and voltage. The results show that the cell design of Mg-air batteries is important for their lifetime and cell performance. The performance of the aqueous magnesium cell is increased several folds when the design is changed to a simple electrolyte flow cell.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2196-0216			WOS:000753965000021

In this communication, we report the development of a Mn-Co-based nanowire array as a complementary catalyst for efficient water splitting in near-neutral media. The Mn-Co-borate nanowire array on carbon cloth (Mn-Co-Bi/CC) was prepared via oxidative polarization of a MnCo2O4 nanowire array (MnCo2O4) in potassium borate (K-Bi), behaving as an efficient electrocatalyst for water oxidation with an overpotential of 366 mV to drive a catalytic current density of 10 mA cm(-2) in 0.5 M K-Bi (pH: 9.2). MnCo2O4/CC exhibits outstanding hydrogen evolution activity requiring an overpotential of 293 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) in 0.5 M K-Bi. The two-electrode electrolyser using Mn-Co-Bi/CC as the anode and MnCo2O4/CC as the cathode drives 10 mA cm(-2) at a cell voltage of 1.97 V with strong long-term electrochemical durability and 100% faradaic efficiency.									30	0	0	0	0	0	30			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000403664800015

Herein, we first reported nanostructured Ni2P-C as an efficient catalyst for urea electrooxidation. The Ni2P-C catalyst was prepared by a facile hydrothermal method and the structure and morphology were further characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and transmission electron microscope (TEM). The hexagonal crystal structure for Ni2P was indicated by the characteristic peaks in the XRD patterns, and lattice fringes of Ni2P were clearly observed in the high-resolution TEM images. The catalytic ability for urea electrooxidation was studied by cyclic voltammetry and chronoamperometry techniques. It was found that the current density at 0.5 V was ca. 70.4 mA cm(-2), about 2.7 times higher than that of the referenced commercial nickel oxide catalyst. A good catalytic stability for urea oxidation was also obtained. A diffusion-controlled process was observed for urea oxidation on Ni2P catalyst while the active sites arising from Ni(II) ion oxidation was following a surface-redox-reaction-controlled process. Kinetics studies by impedance spectroscopy and Tafel slope analysis displayed improved charge-transfer kinetics towards urea electrooxidation. The results demonstrated that Ni2P would have potential applications for catalytic urea oxidation.									44	4	0	0	4	0	45			2196-0216			WOS:000425380200013

We then review the chemical anomalies that could be related to the destruction of He-3 in red giants stars. We show how a simple consistent mechanism can lead to the destruction of He-3 in low mass stars and simultaneously account for the low C-12/C-13 ratios and low lithium abundances observed in giant stars of different populations. This process should both naturally account for the recent measurements of He-3/H in galactic HII regions and allow for high values of He-3 observed in some planetary nebulae. We propose a simple statistical estimation of the fraction of stars that may be affected by this process.									15	0	0	0	0	0	15			0038-6308	1572-9672		WOS:000075472200021

Here, the film composite of Co3O4 nanoparticles decorated well-defined one-dimensional (1D) silicon nanowires arrays (SiNWs@Co3O4) are constructed by employing SiNWs arrays as a building block via a facile calcination approach. In comparison with bare SiNWs arrays, the resultant SiNWs@Co3O4 arrays composite exhibits distinctly enhanced photocatalytic performance for the evolution of hydrogen. The enhanced photoactivity is attributed to the formation of a direct Z-scheme band alignment in the SiNWs@Co3O4 film composite, which results in an improved spatial separation and migration of photoinduced electron-hole pairs as compared to bare SiNWs under light irradiation. Our work is anticipated to promote ongoing interest in the design of high-performance artificial 1D-based Z-scheme film photocatalysts with enhanced performance.									10	0	0	0	2	0	10			0920-5861	1873-4308		WOS:000475744800035

It was found that the three body dissociation channel, H + H + O(P-3/D-1), becomes prominent at wavelengths shorter than the Lyman alpha-line at 121.6 nm. The present work explores the kinetic consequences of this discovery for several astrophysically motivated examples. The irradiation of a dilute low-temperature gas by unscreened solar radiation, similar to early stage photochemical processing in a comet coma, shows significant increase in the production of O-2-molecules at shorter times, <1 day, that might physically correspond to the photochemical reaction zone of the coma. Several examples of planetary atmospheres show increased O-atom production at high altitudes but relatively little modification of the equilibrium O-2 concentrations predicted by conventional models.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1463-9076	1463-9084		WOS:000639548800001	33885109

Nevertheless, it still remains a big challenge to design high-performance direct Z-scheme photocatalysts without the use of noble metals as electron mediators. Herein, a unique Cd0.5Zn0.5S/WO3-x direct Z-scheme heterojunction was constructed for the first time, which consisted of smaller O-vacancy-decorated WO3-x nanocrystals anchoring on Cd0.5Zn0.5S nanocrystals with S vacancies and zinc blende/wurtzite (ZB/WZ) twinning superlattices. Under visible-light (lambda > 420 nm) irradiation, the Cd0.5Zn0.5S/WO3-x composites exhibited an outstanding H-2 evolution reaction (HER) activity of 20.50 mmol h(-1) g(-1) (corresponding to the apparent quantum efficiency of 18.0% at 420 nm), which is much superior to that of WO3-x, Cd0.5Zn0.5S, and Cd0.5Zn0.5S loaded with Pt. Interestingly, the introduced O and S vacancies contributed to improving the HER activity of Cd0.5Zn0.5S/WO3-x significantly. Moreover, the cycling and long-term HER measurements confirmed the robust photocatalytic stability of Cd0.5Zn0.5S/WO3-x for H-2 production. The excellent light harvesting and efficient spatial charge separation induced by the ZB/WZ twinning homojunctions and defect-promoted direct Z-scheme charge-transfer pathway are responsible for the exceptional HER capability. Our study could enlighten the rational engineering and optimization of semiconductor nanostructures for energy and environmental applications.									1	0	0	0	1	0	1			1477-9226	1477-9234		WOS:000733890400001	34939639	
J	Lu, Guoping; DePaolo, Donald J.								Lattice Boltzmann simulation of water isotope fractionation during ice crystal growth in clouds								GEOCHIMICA ET COSMOCHIMICA ACTA				180				271	283		10.1016/j.gca.2015.11.048				MAY 1 2016	2016	We describe a lattice Boltzmann (LB) method for simulating water isotope fractionation during diffusion-limited ice crystal growth by vapor deposition from water-oversaturated air. These conditions apply to the growth of snow crystals in clouds where the vapor composition is controlled by the presence of both ice crystals and water droplets. Modeling of water condensation with the LB method has the advantage of allowing concentration fields to evolve based on local conditions so that the controls on grain shapes of the condensed phase can be studied simultaneously with the controls on isotopic composition and growth rate. Water isotope fractionation during snow crystal growth involves kinetic effects due to diffusion of water vapor in air, which requires careful consideration of the boundary conditions at the ice-vapor interface. The boundary condition is relatively simple for water isotopes because the molecular exchange rate for water at the interface is large compared to the crystal growth rate. Our results for the bulk crystal isotopic composition are consistent with simpler models using analytical solutions for radial geometry. However, the model results are sufficiently different for oxygen isotopes that they could affect the interpretation of D-excess values of snow and ice. The extent of vapor oversaturation plays a major role in determining the water isotope fractionation as well as the degree of dendritic growth. Departures from isotopic equilibrium increase at colder temperatures as diffusivity decreases. Dendritic crystals are isotopically heterogeneous. Isotopic variations within individual snow crystals could yield information on the microphysics of ice condensation as well as on the accommodation or sticking coefficient of water associated with vapor deposition. Our results are ultimately a first step in implementing LB models for kinetically controlled condensation or precipitation reactions, but needs to be extended also to cases where the molecular exchange rate is comparable to the crystal growth rate. This approach could also be applicable to aerosol chemical evolution. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			0016-7037	1872-9533		WOS:000372566600016

Al was added as pore former to endow the Ni electrodes with porous structures. Heat treatment was performed to improve the adhesion of the prepared coatings and thus boost the durability of the obtained Ni electrodes. The electrochemical results and characterizations revealed that porous Ni electrodes were successfully obtained. The porosity of obtained electrodes was increased with the addition of Al. Alloy phases such as NiAl and Ni3Al were detected after heat treatment. An oxide layer was found surrounding Ni layers after chemical leaching. The thickness of oxide layer was found increased with heating temperature and Al addition. NiO, Ni(OH)(2) and NiOOH were found in the leached samples. With porous coatings, the electrodes possessed an improved current density of HER/OER. The Tafel slops of HER/OER were about 120mv/dec which indicated that the rate of water splitting was controlled by Volmer step. Due to the existence of oxide layers and unconnected pores, some samples exhibited Warburg diffusion behavior. Benefitting from the loose and porous microstructure, N30A sintered at 400 degrees C performed the best catalytic activity for HER/OER, and is considered the best sample for water splitting in alkaline condition.

However, the high cost of noble metals limits their practical application. Therefore, it is of great significance to explore alternative catalysts based on noble-metal-free materials. Herein, FeNi intermetallic compound nanoparticles wrapped with N-doped graphitized carbon (FeNi@NGC) are prepared by a facile pyrolysis approach. The FeNi@NGC is used as a novel cocatalyst of host photocatalysts, such as g-C3N4, to boost their photogenerated charge separation. In an aqueous solution containing triethanolamine and under visible-light irradiation, the optimized FeNi@NGC/g-C3N4 (FNC15) composite photocatalyst exhibits significantly increased PC activity with a H-2 production rate of 2.696 mmol g(-1) h(-1), which is over 283 times that of primary g-C3N4 and even higher than that of 1.0 wt% Pt/g-C3N4. Furthermore, the FNC15 showed excellent stability and reusability. The apparent quantum yield (AQY) of the FNC15 composite photocatalyst reaches 24.78% and 7.28% at 400 nm and 420 nm, respectively. Notably, the FNC15 can promote photocatalytic overall water splitting with an H-2 evolution rate of about 0.167 mmol g(-1) h(-1). Experimental analysis and DFT calculations are performed to investigate the mechanism of excellent PC H-2 evolution. It appears that the FeNi@NGC loading on the surface of host photocatalysts can (i) boost the charge carrier separation and transfer because of the secondary charge transfer in the FeNi intermetallic compound and (ii) ameliorate the kinetics of H-2 evolution on the surface of the photocatalyst and achieve obviously enhanced H-2 generation. This work provides a new strategy for preparing efficient noble-metal-free cocatalysts for boosting photocatalytic H-2 evolution.									33	3	0	0	7	0	33			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000521938400055

However, the sluggish electrochemical reactions and associated side reactions in metal-gas batteries require suitable catalysts, which possess high catalytic activity and selectivity. Although precious metal catalysts show a higher catalytic activity, high cost of the precious metal catalysts hinders their commercial applications. In contrast, nonprecious metal catalysts complement the weakness of cost, and the gap in activity can be made up by increasing the amount of the nonprecious metal active centers. Herein, recent work on carbon-based nonprecious metal catalysts for metal-gas batteries is summarized. This review starts with introducing the advantages of carbon-based nonprecious metal catalysts, followed by a discussion of the synthetic strategy of carbon-based nonprecious metal catalysts and classification of active sites, and finally a summary of present metal-gas batteries with the carbon-based nonprecious metal catalysts is presented. The challenges and opportunities for carbon-based nonprecious metal catalysts in metal-gas batteries are also explored.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			1613-6810	1613-6829		WOS:000725960200001	34859956

The photocatalytic reaction using semiconductor photocatalysts is a promising approach for sunlight-induced organic synthesis due to its significant advantages of operation under mild conditions, stability, and recyclicity. TiO2 is one of the most widely studied photocatalysts; however, the low selectivity for partial oxidation due to the complete decomposition to CO2 and lack of utilization of visible-light hampers its practical application. Here, we successfully demonstrated selective oxidation of toluene to benzaldehyde using a Pd-loaded BiVO4 photocatalyst under visible light irradiation. Furthermore, we confirmed that the reaction proceeds even under light irradiation up to 520 nm; this is the first report using blue-to-green light-responsive semiconductor photocatalyst for converting toluene to benzaldehyde. Achieving efficient organic synthe-sis under visible light using semiconductor photocatalyst is an important step toward solar-to-chemical conversion. (c) 2020 Elsevier Inc.

In the temperature range 373-723 K, the evolution of O-2 and NO2 accompanying the desorption of NO from NO saturated Cu-ZSM-5 suggested the formation of nitrite/nitrate species. The amount of O-2 adsorbed was very much lower than that of NO. The desorption profile of O-2 after contacting Cu-ZSM-5 with O-2 at 623 K showed a low temperature peak (369 K) confirming the spontaneous ability of O-2 desorption from copper zeolite. Moreover, successive saturation cycles of NO followed by O-2 and vice versa have been performed at various temperatures (298-623 K) to understand the modifications which the adsorption sites undergo when the two molecules NO and O-2 are available together for adsorption on the catalyst sites. After each saturation cycle, a TPD profile was recorded following the evolution of NO, O-2 and other NOx species. The competitive adsorption experiments revealed that, at 623 K, NO was not able to successfully compete with O-2 for the adsorption sites, therefore the adsorption of NO at 623 K on O-2 saturated catalyst was not completely restored. On the basis of the experimental work, an overall adsorption reaction scheme of NO on Cu-ZSM-5 was proposed.

J	Kraaijeveld, AR; Hutcheson, KA; Limentani, EC; Godfray, HCJ								Costs of counterdefenses to host resistance in a parasitoid of Drosophila								EVOLUTION				55	9			1815	1821						SEP 2001	2001	The ability of a parasitoid to evolve enhanced counterdefenses against host resistance and its possible costs were studied in a Drosophila-parasitoid system. We reared Asobara tabida (Braconidae, Hymenoptera) exclusively on D. melanogaster to impose artificial selection for improved counterdefenses against cellular encapsulation, the main host defense against parasitism. Controls were reared on D. subobscura, the main host of the population of wasps from which the laboratory culture was derived and a species that never encapsulates parasitoids. We observed improved survival and avoidance of encapsulation in all five selection lines compared to their paired control lines, although there was unexpected variation among pairs. Improved survival was associated with parasitoid eggs becoming embedded in host tissue, where they were protected from circulating haemocytes. There were no differences among lines in average adult size, fat content, egg load, or performance on D. subobscura. However, the duration of the egg stage in selection lines was longer than that of control lines, probably because of reduced nutrient and/or oxygen supply when eggs are embedded in host tissue. We suggest that this delay in hatching reduces the probability of parasitoid survival if another parasitoid egg is laid in the same host (superparasitism or multiparasitism) and hence is a cost of enhanced counterdefenses against host resistance.									56	1	0	0	51	0	56			0014-3820	1558-5646		WOS:000171711800009	11681736

In this work, bismuth-rich strategy is used to promote the CB position. Bi4O5X2 (X = Br, I) nanosheets with dominant {101} facets exposure are synthesized by molecular precursors hydrolysis route. Bi4O5Br2 and Bi4O5I2 samples were characterized by X-ray diffraction patterns (XRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectra (DRS), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and photoelectrochemical measurements. Bi4O5Br2 displays higher photocatalytic activity than Bi4O5I2 for H-2 production. And the H-2 evolution rate of Bi4O5Br2 reach 6.81 ltmol h(-1) with the apparent quantum efficiency of 0.93% at 420 nm. It is the first work to report photocatalytic H2 production using Bi4O5X2 photocatalysts. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Eight hundred male birds of slow-growing birds (Ancona: A, Leghorn: L, crossbreed Cornish x Leghorn: CL), medium-growing (Gaina: G, Robusta Maculata: RM, Kabir: K, Naked Neck: NN) and fast-growing strains (Ross: R) were organically reared. A and L genotypes displayed a quicker reaction time when submitted to tonic immobility test, and a great variety of behaviour and exploiting all the pasture area. Concerning feather conditions L, A, CL G and RM showed the best values for all considered body regions, as well as the absolute absence of foot pad and breast blister lesions. Static behaviour of R and G chickens did not produce a significant oxidative burst whereas, the active behaviour of A, slow-growing birds, increased the oxygen demand. Plasma alpha-tocopherol followed the trend of kinetic and foraging activity being higher in slow-, intermediate in medium-and lower in fast-growing birds. The adaptability index showed the best result of slow-growing strains with intermediate results in medium-growing and the worst in fast-growing ones. There is a negative linear correlation between adaptation and daily weight gain. However, within the same sub-group (slow, medium and fast), there is no correlation between daily weight gain and adaptation to an organic system. Even if R chickens had the highest productive performance, they appeared no adapted to the organic system. Daily weight gain (<50 g/d) is a prerequisite for chicken adaptation, but even birds with similar weight gains showed wide variations in the adaptation.									38	0	0	0	18	0	39			1594-4077	1828-051X		WOS:000375787700006

Delayed ignition may lead to high-amplitude pressure fluctuations that can damage the burner (strong ignition), whereas early ignition may fail. This paper describes a numerical study of a strong ignition sequence observed in a laboratory-scale single-injector rocket chamber ignited by a laser and fueled with gaseous oxygen and hydrogen. OH-emission images, Schlieren pictures, and pressure measurements make it possible to follow the flame propagation experimentally. The present large eddy simulation (LES) approach includes shock treatment, a six species-seven reaction chemical scheme for H-2-O-2, and a model for the energy deposition by a laser. Flame/turbulence interaction is modeled with the thickened flame concept. LES is used to compute both the filling phase (during which the gaseous hydrogen and oxygen mix) and the ignition phase. The flame location and structure, as well as the temporal evolution of the chamber pressure obtained numerically, are in good agreement with the experiment. The use of complex chemistry in the computation also allows the comparison of LES data with experimental OH-images and shows that the sensitivity of the CCD camera used to record the spontaneous emission of the OH* radical is not high enough to property locate the flame front in rich regions. The combined experimental and numerical results lead to a more detailed analysis of the ignition processes and its coupling with flow rate oscillations in the H-2 and O-2 feeding lines.

The reaction is catalysed by ribonucleotide reductases (RNRs), an ancient enzyme family comprised of three classes. Each class has distinct operational constraints, and are broadly distributed across organisms from all three domains, though few class I RNRs have been identified in archaeal genomes, and classes II and III likewise appear rare across eukaryotes. In this study, we examine whether this distribution is best explained by presence of all three classes in the Last Universal Common Ancestor (LUCA), or by horizontal gene transfer (HGT) of RNR genes. We also examine to what extent environmental factors may have impacted the distribution of RNR classes.Results: Our phylogenies show that the Last Eukaryotic Common Ancestor (LECA) possessed a class I RNR, but that the eukaryotic class I enzymes are not directly descended from class I RNRs in Archaea. Instead, our results indicate that archaeal class I RNR genes have been independently transferred from bacteria on two occasions. While LECA possessed a class I RNR, our trees indicate that this is ultimately bacterial in origin. We also find convincing evidence that eukaryotic class I RNR has been transferred to the Bacteroidetes, providing a stunning example of HGT from eukaryotes back to Bacteria. Based on our phylogenies and available genetic and genomic evidence, class II and III RNRs in eukaryotes also appear to have been transferred from Bacteria, with subsequent within-domain transfer between distantly-related eukaryotes. Under the three-domains hypothesis the RNR present in the last common ancestor of Archaea and eukaryotes appears, through a process of elimination, to have been a dimeric class II RNR, though limited sampling of eukaryotes precludes a firm conclusion as the data may be equally well accounted for by HGT.Conclusions: Horizontal gene transfer has clearly played an important role in the evolution of the RNR repertoire of organisms from all three domains of life. Our results clearly show that class I RNRs have spread to Archaea and eukaryotes via transfers from the bacterial domain, indicating that class I likely evolved in the Bacteria. However, against the backdrop of ongoing transfers, it is harder to establish whether class II or III RNRs were present in the LUCA, despite the fact that ribonucleotide reduction is an essential cellular reaction and was pivotal to the transition from RNA to DNA genomes. Instead, a general pattern of ongoing horizontal transmission emerges wherein environmental and enzyme operational constraints, especially the presence or absence of oxygen, are likely to be major determinants of the RNR repertoire of genomes.									37	0	0	0	33	0	38			1471-2148			WOS:000287577100001	21143941

Hubble Space Telescope observations of boron in G dwarfs								ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL				543	2			850	860		10.1086/317139				NOV 10 2000	2000	The boron abundances for two young solar-type members of the Orion association, ED -6 degrees 1250 and HD 294297, are derived from Hubble Space Telescope STIS spectra of the B I transition at 2496.771 Angstrom. The best-fit boron abundances for the target stars are 0.13 and 0.34 dex lower than the solar meteoritic value of log epsilon (B) = 2.78. An anticorrelation of boron and oxygen is found for Orion when these results are added to previous abundances obtained for four B-type stars and the G-type star ED -5 degrees 1317. An analysis of the uncertainties in the abundance calculations indicates that the observed anticorrelation is probably real. The B versus O relation observed in the Orion association does not follow the positive correlation of boron versus oxygen that is observed for the field stars with roughly solar metallicity. The observed anticorrelation can be accounted for by a simple model in which two poorly mixed components of gas (supernova ejecta and boron-enriched ambient medium) contribute to the new stars that form within the lifetime of the association. This model predicts an anticorrelation for Be as well, at least as strong as for boron.									10	0	0	0	0	0	10			0004-637X	1538-4357		WOS:000165599300029

The g-C3N4/carbon black/NiS composite photocatalyst were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy (UV-vis), N-2 adsorption, photoluminescence (PL) spectra and transient photocurrent responses. The photocatalytic activities for photocatalytic hydrogen evolution under visible light irradiation (lambda >= 420 nm) were measured using an aqueous solution containing triethanolamine as an electron donor. Moreover, the results showed that the ternary g-C3N4 photocatalyst loaded by 0.5 wt% carbon black and 1.5 wt% NiS could achieve the highest H-2-production rate of 992 mu mol g(-1) h(-1) under visible-light irradiation (>420 nm), which is about 2.51 times higher than that of the corresponding binary g-C(3)N(4)11.5% NiS photocatalyst. It is believed that the enhanced photocatalytic H-2-evolution activities could be attributed to the excellent synergetic effect between the carbon black and NiS as co-catalysts on the surface of g-C3N4, leading to the improved visible light absorption, promoted charge separation and enhanced the following H-2-evolution kinetics. This work would not only demonstrate the promising potentials of carbon black as co-catalyst for applications in visible-light H-2 generation, but also offer a new insight into the construction of highly efficient and stable g-C3N4-based hybrid semiconductor nanocomposites with dual co-catalysts for diverse photocatalytic applications.

The largest isotopic fractionations in the system occur during U reduction, removal, and burial. Applying this basic framework, global U isotope mass balance models have been used to predict the extent of ocean floor anoxia during key intervals throughout Earth's history. However, there are currently minimal constraints on the isotopic fractionation that occurs during reduction and burial in anoxic and iron-rich (ferruginous) aquatic systems, despite the consensus that ferruginous conditions are thought to have been widespread through the majority of our planet's history. Here we provide the first exploration of delta U-238 values in natural ferruginous settings. We measured delta U-238 in sediments from two modern ferruginous lakes (Brownie Lake and Lake Pavin), the water column of Brownie Lake, and sedimentary rocks from the Silurian-Devonian boundary that were deposited under ferruginous conditions. Additionally, we provide new delta U-238 data from core top sediments from anoxic but nonsulfidic settings in the Peru Margin oxygen minimum zone. We find that delta U-238 values from sediments deposited in all of these localities are highly variable but on average are indistinguishable from adjacent oxic sediments. This forces a reevaluation of the global U isotope mass balance and how U isotope values are used to reconstruct the evolution of the marine redox landscape.									19	1	0	0	1	0	20			0886-6236	1944-9224		WOS:000566242800004

An application of rapid-scan EPR to the study of intermediates of the water splitting mechanism of photosystem II								BIOCHEMISTRY				46	50			14335	14341		10.1021/bi7018767				DEC 18 2007	2007	Tyr Z of photosystem II mediates electron transfer from the water splitting site, a Mn4Ca cluster, to the specialized chlorophyll assembly P-680. Due to its proton-limited redox properties and the proximity to the Mn cluster, it is thought to play a critical role in the proton-coupled electron transfer reactions that constitute the four-step oxidation mechanism (so-called S-state transitions) of water to molecular oxygen. Spectroscopic evidence for the Tyr Z radical has been scarce in intact preparations (it is difficult to probe it optically, and too short-lived for EPR characterization) until recently. Advances in recent years have allowed the trapping at liquid helium temperatures and EPR characterization of metalloradical intermediates, attributed to tyrosyl Z(center dot) magnetically interacting with the Mn cluster. We have extended these studies and examined the evolution of the spectra of five intermediates: S0Yz center dot, S0Yz center dot (with 5% MeOH), S1YZ center dot, S2YZ center dot, and S2YZ center dot (with 5% MeOH) in the temperature range of 11-230 K. A rapid-scan EPR method has been applied at elevated temperatures. The tyrosyl radical decouples progressively from Mn, as the Mn relaxation rate increases with an increase in temperature. Above similar to 100 K, the spectra collapse to the unperturbed spectrum of Tyr Z(center dot), which is found to be somewhat broader than that of the stable Tyr D-center dot radical. This study provides a simple means for recording the spectrum of Tyr Z(center dot) and extends earlier observations that link the photochemistry at liquid helium temperatures to the photochemistry at temperatures that support S-state transitions.									15	0	0	0	9	0	15			0006-2960			WOS:000251547700001	18020377

The detailed oxygenation mechanism of 2R, 3S, 4S-cis-LCD to flav-2-en-3,4-diols was investigated using the density functional theory method. An initial model for the calculation was constructed from a structure obtained by a 100-ps molecular dynamics simulation of Arabidopsis ANS under physiological conditions. This model consisted of an LCD molecule as the substrate together with an iron atom, two histidine residues, an aspartic acid residue, a succinate, and an oxygen atom as ligands of the iron atom. The results of the calculation indicated that both the C-3 and C-4 positions of LCD can be oxidized, although C-4 oxidation is preferable. The C-3 oxidation required several steps to form flavan-3,3,4-triol:1) formation of Fe-III-OH and a substrate C-3 radical via hydrogen atom abstraction by Fe-IV=O, 2) formation of a C-3 ketone and a water molecule, 3) addition of OH- into the C-3 position of the ketone, and 4) addition of H+ to form flavan-3,3,4-triol. On the other hand, C-4 oxidation of 2R, 3S, 4S-cis-LCD resulted in the direct formation of 2R,3R-trans-dihydroquercetin. These results suggest that the oxidation at C-3 of LCD, a key reaction for coloring in anthocyanin biosynthesis, can be regarded as a "side reaction" from the viewpoint of quantum mechanics of enzymatic reactions. Molecular evolutional implications of ANS and related proteins are discussed in terms of reaction dynamics.									16	1	0	0	12	0	19			0021-9258	1083-351X		WOS:000239187300075	16702218

In this work, hydrothermal methods have been utilized to synthesize a bismuth oxyiodide semiconductor with deposited Bi nanodots (Bi-BiOI), which could create oxygen defects and accelerate photoinduced charge migration simultaneously. The resulting Bi-BiOI strongly demonstrates the high photocatalytic performance for bisphenol A and methylene blue degradation under visible light. 86% of BPA was degraded after an irradiation time of 4 hours. Electrospray ionization mass spectrometry was employed to detect the evolution of intermediates formed during the decomposition process of bisphenol A, and the following results suggested complete bisphenol A mineralization. Additionally, electron paramagnetic resonance results revealed the production of free radicals and the presence of oxygen vacancies. Furthermore, a distinctively increased photocurrent response and photoluminescence decay dynamics demonstrate that the interface between the Bi nanodots and BiOI semiconductor promotes the separation and migration of photoinduced electron-hole pairs. The lower valence band value (2.57 eV) of Bi-BiOI presented a higher oxidation potential, thus the production of hydroxyl radicals could be promoted considerably. Based on the experimental results, factors such as oxygen vacancies, effective charge migration, suppressed photoinduced electron-hole pair recombination and a high Bi-BiOI oxidation potential would result in advanced free radical production capacity, thereby enhancing the photocatalytic efficiency. The findings of our work will contribute to the fabrication of metal nanodot deposited semiconductor photocatalysts and pave the way for the utilization of advanced oxidation technology.									38	2	0	0	9	0	38			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000413905200029	28976515

However, NH3 would not have been a significant component of the neutral or mildly reducing (N-2, CO2, H2O) atmosphere which characterized the Hadean earth(> 3.8 Gyr ago), especially in view of the u.v. lability of NH3, the greater u.v. output of the young sun than pertains today, and the absence of an atmospheric u.v. screen. Heterogeneous phase reactions, following atmospheric chemistry, have been proposed as a prebiotic NH3 source. Lightning, or bolides (meteorites and comets), generated NOx., and Fe2+ in the sea could have reduced NO2- resulting from the NOx. to NH4+; this disequilibrium NH4+ level could have supported the production of the nitrogenous organic building blocks of life. NOx. and NHy thus could both have had important roles in the origin and evolution of life. Burgeoning biota could soon have depleted abiotically generated NH4+, and biological N-2 fixation could have evolved in its present Fe-demanding, O-2-sensitive forms in the Archaean O-2-free, Fe2+-rich environment. Organic matter could have driven biological denitrification reactions based on NO2- and NO(3)(-)generated abiologically using some redox components which evolved in earlier chemolithotrophs and photolithotrophs, regenerating atmospheric NOx. and producing N2O. Any atmospheric NH3 leaking from oceanic biology would have been subject to u.v. breakdown and rain-out. Although O-2-evolving photosynthesis probably began in the Archean some 3.5 Gyr ago, any O-2 accumulation was local until 2.0 Gyr ago (Proterozoic) due to consumption by oxidation of Fe2+ and S2-. However, localized O-2 accumulation before 2.0 Gyr ago could account for the observed early evolution of cytochrome oxidase and the possibility of O-2-consuming chemolithotrophic and chemoorganotrophic nitrification, with further possibilities of NOx. production. Oxygen accumulation globally from 2.0 Gyr onwards coincided approximately with the evolution of eukaryotes, which contributed phagotrophy to the reactions of the N cycle as well as the nutrification-like aerobic production of NO. by nitric oxide synthetase, while lightning and bolides could now generate NO. from N-2 and O-2.Evidence for terrestrial ecosystems is found from 1.0 Gyr onwards; NOx. and NH3 generated by terrestrial biota stands a greater chance of escaping to the atmosphere than do these compounds generated in the sea where recycling within the water body is likely. As CO2 levels fell and O-2 levels rose, NH3 cycling in the photorespiratory carbon oxidation cycle might have been evident as early as 1 Gyr ago, although this does not seem to be a major contributor to atmospheric NH3 today. Embryophyte evolution on land 450 Myr ago, together with symbionts and biophages, increased primary productivity and N cycling on land, with greater quantitative possibilities for NOx. and NH3 escape to the atmosphere. The evolution of lignin land related phenylpropanoids) at least 400 Myr ago, with associated NH3 recycling in vascular land plant, does not seem ton present evidence) to increase NH3 loss to the atmosphere significantly. Biomass burning occurred at least 350 Myr ago with lightning as the likely ignition source; such burning yielded NO., NH3, N2O and N-2 from organic N. As in earlier times, the existence of terrestrial embryophyte vegetation has been punctuated by major bolide impacts, with the Cretaceous-Tertiary boundary impact generating perhaps 10(4) as much NO. as a year's thunderstorms do today, although the toxicity of NOx. per se to vegetation might not have been the major effect of the NOx. on biota. Terrestrial plants suffered fewer extinctions at this time than did many other major taxa. Despite such very significant generators of atmospheric combined N as major bolide impacts, the mean levels of NHy, NOx. and N2O land O-3) in the atmosphere during the 450 Myr existence of embryophyte vegetation was lower than the current, globally averaged, anthropogenically influenced values. Current globally averaged levels of atmospheric combined N are thus not without precedent in the history of life, globally for NOx., and locally for NHy, so vegetation has had evolutionary experience of high atmospheric combined N. However, this should not make us complacent about the impact of current wide-spread and continuing anthropogenic inputs of combined N, in view of the rate and extent of the inputs, and their combination with other aspects of local anthropogenic influence (e.g. SO, from burning of high-S coal), stratospheric O-3 depletion, and global environmental change (increasing CO2, temperature and sea-level).					3rd New Phytologist Symposium on Major Biological Issues Resulting from Anthropogenic Disturbance of the Nitrogen Cycle3rd New Phytologist Symposium on Major Biological Issues Resulting from Anthropogenic Disturbance of the Nitrogen Cycle	SEP 03-05, 1997SEP 03-05, 1997		LANCASTER UNIV, LANCASTER, ENGLANDLANCASTER UNIV, LANCASTER, ENGLAND	33	0	0	0	22	1	33			0028-646X	1469-8137		WOS:000074202000021

They are analyzed by means of non-LTE models for spherically expanding atmospheres computed using standard assumptions. Complex model atoms of helium, carbon and oxygen are taken into account.We find stellar luminosities in the range from 10(5.1) L-. to 10(5.6) L-., and mass loss rates of approximately 10(-4) M-. yr(-1). The stellar temperature T*, defined as the effective temperature related to the stellar core radius, is of the order of 100 kK. The atmospheric compositions show carbon mass fractions of about 0.4, oxygen mass fractions in the range 0.1-0.3 and no indications of nitrogen.Stellar parameters obtained this way build an empirical basis for the understanding of the late evolutionary phases of massive stars. The C/He and O/C abundance ratios are sensitive discriminates of stellar evolutionary models, since they depend, for example, on the adopted mass loss relation, the amount of overshooting, the C-12 (alpha, gamma) O-16 reaction rate, and the metallicity of the progenitor.We compare our results to evolutionary calculations and to a galactic sample of WC stars. The deduced abundances agree with some evolutionary calculations, but are in disagreement with others. The derived mass loss rates are found to be in general agreement with common M-L-relations. Systematic differences between the galactic and the LMC sample exist, possibly reflecting a dependence of WC mass loss on metallicity.									44	0	0	0	0	0	44			1432-0746			WOS:000071079700027

Sunlight, the most plentiful source of renewable energy, is especially problematic in this regard as it is so diffuse. One way to convert solar irradiation to fuels effectively would be to develop large surface area photo-electrochemical devices that could use sunlight directly to split water into H-2 and O-2. However, in order to be feasible, such an approach requires that these devices (and their components) are extremely cheap. In this review, we will discuss catalysts for the water oxidation half-reaction of electrochemical water splitting that can be produced by electrodeposition (a technique well suited to large-scale, low-cost applications), and that are based on the comparatively plentiful and inexpensive first row transition metals. Special attention will be paid to the electrodeposition conditions used in the various examples given, and structure-function relationships for electrochemical water oxidation for the materials produced by these techniques will be elucidated.									71	2	0	0	5	0	71			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000375608500004

Pristine gC(3)N(4) possesses a negative surface charge, which later transforms into a positive charge upon doping with elemental oxygen. This reversal of surface charge, which occurred on top of doping, established the opportune electrostatic coupling of positively charged O-gC(3)N(4) and negatively charged B-rGO. Moreover, the concerted dual doping of both O-gC(3)N(4) and B-rGO, which exhibited n-type and p-type conductivity, respectively, allowed the construction of a nanoscale p-n heterojunction system at the interface, warranting a more effective and rapid charge separation and in turn bolstering the photocatalytic hydrogen performance. In particular, the optimal loading content of B-rGO was found to be 2 wt% with a corresponding H-2 production rate of 1639 mmol g(-1) after 6 h, which is a remarkable 4-fold photocatalytic improvement as compared to that of O-gC(3)N(4). In brief, this study highlights that the dual doping of both gC(3)N(4) and rGO and their hybridization present a powerful strategy to increase the photoactivity of the composite since doping could remarkably modulate their interaction at the heterointerface.									101	4	0	0	10	0	102			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000425302700036

The features of crystal structure were studied by XRD. It has been observed that with x increase the unit cell parameters linearly and slightly decrease. The very small reduction of the unit cell parameters and, of the resulting unit cell volume is caused by the very small difference of ionic radiuses of Ga3+ (0.62 A) and Fe3+ (0.64 A) cations. Raman spectroscopy investigations and Mossbauer studies were performed. The distribution of Ga3+ in different non-equivalent oxygen coordination (octahedral, tetrahedral and bipiramidal position) is not statistical. It has been established that in BaFe1.2-xGaxO19 (0 < x < 1.2) solid solutions magnetic properties critically depend on the Ga3+ cations distribution by different oxygen coordination. At a low level of diamagnetic substitution (x < 0.3) Ga3+ cations are preferably distributed in 2b position. At a higher level of diamagnetic substitution (x < 0.9) Ga3+ cations are preferably distributed in 12k position. Experimental data of Mossbauer studies are in good agreement with theoretical data which were obtained using the first principles total energy calculations (based on density functional theory).									108	1	0	0	0	0	108			0272-8842	1873-3956		WOS:000408287900167

The latter UV280 effect was studied in this work by Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy. First, irradiation of the PSII particles with UV280 for about 40 min causes an almost complete loss of OE activity. The remaining OE after 15, 20, 30 and 40 min is respectively 52, 44, 27 and 12% of the OE activity in control PSII particles kept in darkness. Secondly, difference FT-IR spectra of PSII particles irradiated for 30 min, i.e., [PSII irradiated with UV280]-minus-[PSII non-irradiated], show that the UV280 light is at the origin of significant IR absorbance changes in several spectral regions: (i) amide I (1696-1620 cm(-1)) and amide II (1580-1520 cm(-1)), (ii) tyrosine side chain (1620-1580 cm(-1) and 1520-1500 cm(-1), i.e., the nu(8a), nu(8b), and nu(19a) vibrational modes, respectively), and (iii) chlorophylls (1750-1696 cm(-1)). Thirdly, comparison of the UV-B effect reported here with structural changes induced by heat-stress in PSII proteins [M. Joshi, hi. Fragata, Z. Naturforsch. 54c (1999) 35-43] clearly indicates that the stability of the functional centers in the PSII complex is dependent on a dynamic equilibrium between alpha-helix conformers and extended chain (P-strand) structures. In this framework, transient 'alpha-helix-to-beta-strand transitions' are susceptible of giving rise in vivo to recurrent changes in the activity of the PSII complex, and as such act as a control mechanism of the photosynthetic function in the thylakoid membrane.

In all cases, an initial active region of copper dissolution was followed by a decrease in current density. In the 400-g/L LiBr solutions, four anodic current peaks were observed, whereas in the 700-g/L LiBr solutions, only two well-defined peaks were observed. The low-activation energy values obtained for the copper dissolution process in the 400-g/L and 700-g/L LiBr solutions were consistent with the formation of poorly structured thin passive layers via a diffusion-controlled metal electrodissolution process. The anodic polarization behavior of copper in the 400-g/L and 700-g/L LiBr solutions at 25 degrees C was compared with the respective Pourbaix diagrams (potential-pH diagrams). In the 400-g/L LiBr solution (pH = 6.80), the initial anodic dissolution region exhibited Tafel behavior attributed to the formation of CuBr2- complexes. At higher potentials, passivation was observed, associated with the formation of copper(I) bromide (CuBr) and copper(II) oxide-copper(II) hydroxide (CuO-Cu[OH](2)) films. Lastly, a new active region appeared, initially associated with the oxidation of CuBr2- to Cu2+, and then with the oxidation of water to oxygen. In the 700-g/L LiBr solution (pH = 5.65), the initial active region of formation of CuBr2- was followed by the formation of CuBr and copper trioxybromide (CuBr2 center dot 3Cu[OH](2)) passive films. Finally, the increase in anodic current density was attributed to oxygen evolution.									11	0	0	0	0	0	11			0010-9312	1938-159X		WOS:000229304100008

In recent years, solutions-based techniques have attracted great interest due to their advantage in controlling reaction parameters. Among the techniques, amine-based seed-mediated solvothermal growth provides a versatile method for the production of various Pt nanoparticles. However, the amine species that functioned as the stabilizing agent would absorb at the surface of Pt, resulting in poor electrocatalytic performance. For this reason, the amine ligand must be removed in order to reveal the expected catalytic performance of Pt. In this work, we proposed a combination strategy that employed acid treatment under gentle heating followed by thermal treatment to remove the amine ligand and investigate their catalytic effect on formic acid oxidation. The acid wash involved in subjecting the catalyst in acetic acid glacial at 85 degrees C for 1 h + 9 h of heat treatment at 85 degrees C in air atmosphere. The experimental procedures were repeated by subjecting the Pt to 3 h in acetic acid + 7 h of heat treatment, followed by 5 h in acetic acid + 5 h heat treatment and a single treatment by immersing the Pt nanoparticles in acetic acid for 10 h. We reported that this combined activation technique improves significantly the performance of Pt nanoparticles in catalyzing formic acid oxidation. The results showed that 3 h of acid wash + 7 h of thermal treatment is the optimal condition for a high electrochemical surface area (ECSA) value of 1.006 +/- 0.02 m(2)/g, lower coverage of CO adsorption and a steady-state current of 3.03 mA/cm(2) made at 0.67 V (vs. SCE) at 1000 s during formic acid oxidation. This approach could become a potential procedure for activating the Pt surface attached by amine ligand. (C) 2019 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Here, we first investigated the possibility for 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) electrooxidation into 2,5-furandicarboxylic acid (FDCA) by Ni-based two-dimensional metal-organic frameworks (2D MOFs) as electrocatalysts. FDCA is a desirable alternative to fossil-based terephthalic acids for the production of environmentally friendly polymers. The as-prepared Co-doped 2D MOFs NiCoBDC (Ni2+, BDC = terephthalic acid) have a high FDCA yield of 99%, an excellent yield rate of 20.1 mu mol cm(-2)h(-1)and a faradaic efficiency of 78.8% at 1.55 Vvs.RHE, as performed in an electrolyte at pH 13, where the degradation of HMF was ignored. Benefitting from the accessible pores of HMF molecules, abundant exposed active sites and coupling effects between Ni and Co atoms, 2D NiCo-MOFs realized a high catalytic activity and a robust electrochemical durability. This work demonstrates 2D MOFs as promising electrocatalysts for highly efficient biomass valorization because of their porosity and rich active sites.									39	1	0	0	3	0	39			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000578872600010

The PsbQ protein defines cyanobacterial Photosystem II complexes with highest activity and stability								PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA				104	7			2548	2553		10.1073/pnas.0609337104				FEB 13 2007	2007	Light-induced conversion of water to molecular oxygen by Photosystem 11 (PSII) is one of the most important enzymatic reactions in the biosphere. PSII is a multisubunit membrane protein complex with numerous associated cofactors, but it continually undergoes assembly and disassembly due to frequent light-mediated damage as a result of its normal function. Thus, at any instant, there is heterogeneity in the subunit compositions of PSII complexes within the cell. In particular, cyanobacterial PSII complexes have five associated extrinsic proteins, PsbO, PsbP, PsbQ, PsbU, and PsbV. However, little is known about the interactions of the more recently identified PsbQ protein with other components in cyanobacterial PSII. Here we show that PSII complexes can be isolated from the cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 on the basis of the presence of a polyhistidine-tagged PsbQ protein. Purification of PSII complexes using a tagged extrinsic protein has not been previously described, and this work conclusively demonstrates that PsbQ is present in combination with the PsbO, PsbL1, and PsbV proteins in cyanobacterial PSII. Moreover, PsbQ-associated PSII complexes have higher activity and stability relative to those isolated using histidine-tagged CP47, an integral membrane protein. Therefore, we conclude that the presence of PsbQ defines the fully assembled and optimally active form of the enzyme.									73	2	0	0	71	0	73			0027-8424			WOS:000244438500090	17287351

The prepared black TiO2 samples were characterized by X-ray diffraction, high resolution transmission electron microscopy, Raman spectrameter, photoluminescence emission spectra, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and ultraviolet-visible diffuse reflectance spectra. It shows that the prepared samples possess a unique crystalline core-amorphous shell structure composed of disordered surface and oxygen vacancies, and exhibit enhanced photocatalytic activity in hydrogen production in the methanol-water system in the presence of Pt as a co-catalyst. Under the full solar wavelength range of light, the maximum hydrogen production rate of the B-N co-doped black TiO2 is 18.8 mmol h(-1) g(-1), which is almost 4 times higher than that of pure TiO2.

Stabilized by hydrogen bonds (H-bonds), terminal and cofacial Co-III-OH2 moieties are observed crystallographically in a series of immobilized cubane sites. Solution electrochemistry provided correlations of oxidation potential and pH. For variants containing Ser and Phe adjacent to the metallocofactor, 1e(-)/1H(+) chemistry predominates until pH 8, above which the oxidation becomes pH-independent. Installation of Tyr proximal to the Co4O4 active site provided a single H-bond to one of a set of cofacial Co-III-OH2 groups. With this variant, multi-e(-)/multi-H+ chemistry is observed, along with a change in mechanism at pH 9.5 that is consistent with Tyr deprotonation. With structural similarities to both the oxygen-evolving complex of photosystem II (H-bonded Tyr) and to thin film water oxidation catalysts (Co4O4 core), these findings bridge synthetic and biological systems for water oxidation, highlighting the importance of secondary sphere interactions in mediating multi-e(-)/multi-H+ reactivity.									25	0	0	0	8	0	25			0002-7863			WOS:000426617700008	29401385

High-temperature treatment of the precursor in argon atmosphere first leads to an amorphous SiVOC single-phase ceramic which subsequently undergoes phase-separation, crystallization and finally converts into V8C7/SiC(O) ceramic nanocomposites. Interestingly, the high-temperature stability of V8C7/SiC(O) was shown to strongly depend on the oxygen content present either in the SiC(O) matrix or in the atmosphere during the annealing process. Thus, larger oxygen contents induce a conversion of the V8C7 phase into V5Si3. The specific surface area (SSA) of the obtained nanocomposite powders depends on the processing temperature: The SSA decreases from 64 to 4 m(2)/g as the pyrolysis temperature increases from 600 to 1300 degrees C, respectively. Whereas it increases again to ca. 50 m(2/)g as the sample is exposed to 1700 degrees C (6 h annealing), due to the evolution of CO. Preliminary results of the catalytic activity of the V8C7/SiC(O)-based materials show that they are active for the decomposition of the ammonia. The maximum ammonia conversion efficiency was found to be 35% at around 650 degrees C, which is higher than that of the pure vanadium carbide reported in the literature (ca. 13%).

A major role of T3SEs is to suppress plant immune responses and promote bacterial infection. The YopJ/HopZ acetyltransferases are a superfamily of T3SEs found in both plant and animal pathogenic bacteria. In P. syringae, this superfamily includes the evolutionarily diverse HopZ1, HopZ2 and HopZ3 alleles. To investigate the roles of the HopZ family in immunomodulation, we generated dexamethasone-inducible T3SE transgenic lines of Arabidopsis for HopZ family members and characterized them for immune suppression phenotypes. We show that all of the HopZ family members can actively suppress various facets of Arabidopsis immunity in a catalytic residuedependent manner. HopZ family members can differentially suppress the activation of mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase cascades or the production of reactive oxygen species, whereas all members can promote the growth of non-virulent P. syringae. Localization studies show that four of the HopZ family members containing predicted myristoylation sites are localized to the vicinity of the plasma membrane while HopZ3 which lacks the myristoylation site is at least partially nuclear localized, suggesting diversification of immunosuppressive mechanisms. Overall, we demonstrate that despite significant evolutionary diversification, all HopZ family members can suppress immunity in Arabidopsis.									27	1	0	0	25	0	28			1932-6203			WOS:000347120200102	25546415

Some Aspects of the MOCVD Growth of ZnO Nanorods by Using N2O								JOURNAL OF THE KOREAN PHYSICAL SOCIETY				53	5	SI		3051	3054		10.3938/jkps.53.3051				NOV 2008	2008	The MOCVD growth of ZnO one-dimensional structures is investigated. N2O was used as an oxygen source to carry out depositions between 640 degrees C and 780 degrees C. Some key growth parameters, such as the precursors nature, the carrier gases nature, or the substrate treatment, were varied in order to observe and understand some evolution in the ZnO film morphology. We found that well-defined arrays of 1D structures were difficult to achieve in the considered range of temperatures, by using DMZn-TEN and N2O as precursors and N-2 as a carrier gas. To the contrary, ZnO nanorods and nanotubes were produced under the same conditions when the nitrogen carrier gas was replaced by helium, and ZnO nanoneedles were produced when DEZn was used instead of DMZn-TEN. The morphologies of the ZnO nanostructures were compared between samples grown oil as-received (0001) sapphire, annealed (0001) sapphire, (111) silicon or a 150-nm-thick ZnO buffer layer.					13th International Conference on II-VI Compounds13th International Conference on II-VI Compounds	SEP 10-14, 2007SEP 10-14, 2007		Jeju City, SOUTH KOREAJeju City, SOUTH KOREA	2	0	0	0	0	0	2			0374-4884			WOS:000260935100067

In this work, the effect of parameters such as the amount of H3PO4 and Pt loading was examined regarding the formation of the electrochemical interface of an operating cathodic electrode in a high temperature PEM Fuel Cell. Electrodes beased on commercial 30 wt% Pt/C and H3PO4 imbibed TPS polymer electrolyte membrane were employed. Based on the thickness and catalyst loading of the catalytic layer, there is an optimum amount of acid in relation to the partial pressure of steam (P-H2O) produced at the cathode that leads to uniform wetting of the catalyst avoiding catalyst poisoning and/or blocking due to flooding of the electrode. Interestingly high P-H2O causes a decrease in H-2 evolution reaction rate and increase in H-2 adsorption coverage, implying stronger H-ad bonding with the Pt surface. Moreover, this work describes the development of a reliable procedure for quantitative evaluation of the real electrochemical active surface area (ECSA) of high temperature Pt electrodes by the combined analysis of CO stripping experiments and the simultaneous CO2 recording by means of online mass spectrometry. Regardless of the H3PO4 or Pt loading in the cathodic electrode, increase of steam's partial pressure progressively causes the degradation the Pt/CIH3PO4 electrochemical interface. At P-H2O > 10 kPa, the ECSA decreased in all cases, but more intensely for high amounts of H3PO4 within the electrode structure. The charge of the peak in the cyclic voltammogram did not completely correspond to the CO electrooxidation reaction. This difference is attributed to side oxidation reactions taking place within the same potential window as with the COad electrooxidation and depends on conditioning time (CO adsorption time), temperature and humidity.

The deposited boron-doped diamond electrodes (BDDs) with different boron doping concentrations (10000, 5000 and 500 ppm of B) were applied as anodes. The results showed that the boron doping level influences the electrochemical activity and selectivity of electrode surface due to a decrease in the sp(3)/sp(2) ratio of the BDD material. Special attention was paid to the oxidation efficiency of organic matter (COD = 4225 mg O-2/L, BOD = 366 mg O-2/L) and ammonia (2270 mg N-NH4+/L) in the investigated LLs. Additionally, bisphenol A (BPA; 1539.6 mu g/L), a suspected endocrine disruptor, was studied as a potential indicator of the removal efficiency of micropollutants.It was found that the oxidation of BPA and BOD are correlated with the sp(3)/sp(2) ratio, while a decrease in the sp(3)/sp(2) ratio of the BDD material was associated with the elevated efficiency of N-NH4+ removal. Low pH and the addition of Fe(II) salts suppressed the oxygen evolution reaction, and overcame the mass transport limitation of organics in the case of % OH-mediated oxidation.Regarding the elimination of ammonium nitrogen, lower effectiveness was generally achieved in comparison to the COD removal. The maximum removal of COD and ammonium nitrogen reached 79 and 41%, respectively. These values were much higher than those reported in the previous study involving a single-cell flow reactor. Thus, anaerobic ammonium oxidation (Anammox) processes seem to be a reasonable option as a final step of LL treatment.									37	2	0	0	18	0	39			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000418533400106

Mainly, Li2O2 (lithium peroxide) and to a lesser extent, Li2O (lithium oxide) are assumed to be the discharge products of these batteries formed with the soluble LiO2 (lithium superoxide) considered to be an intermediate product. Bulk Li2O2 is an electronic insulator, and the precipitation of this compound on the cathode is thought to be the main limiting factor in achieving high capacities in lithium-oxygen cells. For the most promising electrolytes including solvents with high donor numbers, microscopy observations frequently reveal crystallite morphologies of Li2O2 compounds, rather than uniform layers covering the electrode surface. The precise morphologies of Li2O and Li2O2 particles, and their effect and their extent of contact with the electrode, which may all affect the capacity and rechargeability, however, remain largely undetermined. Here, we address the stability of various Li2O and Li2O2 surfaces and consequently, their crystallite morphologies using density functional theory calculations and ab initio thermodynamics. In contrast to previous studies, we also consider high-index surface terminations, which exhibit surprisingly low surface energies. We carefully analyze the reasons for the stability of these high-index surfaces, which also prominently influence the equilibrium shape of the particles, at least for Li2O2, and discuss the consequences for the observed morphology of the reaction products.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000659315800060	34009936

The synthesized nanocomposite material demonstrates efficient catalytic kinetics for HER, due to the exposure of best active edge sites of MoS2. The as prepared the nanocomposite was characterized successfully by XRD, SEM, TEM, XPS & EDS were executed that elucidates the crystalline nature of the synthesized nanocomposite material. In an acidic medium, ZnO 30% providing the best ZnO-MoS2 content achieved at 0.26 V. The ZnO-MoS2 Tafel slope is 56 mV/decades the ever reported for hydrogen production in an acidic media for ZnO-MoS2-based electrocatalysts. The electrocatalyst exhibit excellent stability and durability. Chronopotentiometry at 10 mA/cm(2) current density suffers not a significant loss in the potential for 10 h in an acidic media, respectively. The sample of less ZnO concentration results in increased catalytic properties for MoS2, by providing active basal planes for hydrogen evolution reaction along with Mo and S-edges, as predicted by theoretical studies. Interestingly, the catalyst material, architecture and use of nanostructured catalysts have been found useful for improving the efficiency by showing high active reaction sites and the electrical connection of these sites for swift charge kinetics. Therefore, the morphology and structure of fabricated electrocatalysts can have advantageous features for catalysis performance. These findings provide a new stable and efficient electrocatalysts for the development of electro catalyzer devices for the hydrogen gas production based on cost-effective methodology and earth-abundant materials.This work will open a new gateway for the development of functional catalysts in renewable energy reservoirs, which will be scientifically significant and will also provide a roadmap for the development of industrial catalysts.									9	0	0	0	0	0	9			1572-6657	1873-2569		WOS:000624312400005

However, whether long non-coding RNA NUT family member 2A-antisense RNA 1 (NUTM2A-AS1) is involved in matrine-induced inhibition of GC remains unknown. 3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide, cell colony formation, and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick-end labeling assays were employed to determine the proliferation, viability, and apoptosis of GC cells, respectively. The Cancer Genome Atlas database suggested an association between NUTM2A-AS1 and GC. The reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction was used to quantify relative levels of NUTM2A-AS1, miR-613, and vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGFA). Reactive oxygen species generation, glutathione content, and superoxide dismutase activity were determined by corresponding reagents or assay kits. NUTM2A-AS1 knockdown led to attenuated cell viability and proliferation, as well as to enhanced apoptosis of N87 and AGS cells treated with matrine. These changes were prevented by an inhibitor of microRNA (miR)-613. Importantly, NUTM2A-AS1 expression was positively associated with tumor progression in patients with GC. NUTM2A-AS1 and miR-613 regulated the generation of reactive oxygen species, the content of glutathione, and the activity of superoxide dismutase. VEGFA served as an important effector for the NUTM2A-AS1/miR-613-regulated resistance of GC cells to matrine. These results reveal a novel mechanism of matrine resistance in GC.									2	0	0	0	1	0	2			1945-4589			WOS:000829754900017	35771149	
J	Gao, Shan; Lu, Ling; Bai, Yan; Zhang, Peng; Song, Weibo; Duan, Cunming				Zhang, Peng/I-3757-2018				Structural and functional analysis of amphioxus HIF alpha reveals ancient features of the HIF alpha family								FASEB JOURNAL				28	4			1880	1890		10.1096/fj.12-220152				APR 2014	2014	Hypoxia-inducible factors (HIFs) are master regulators of the transcriptional response to hypoxia. To gain insight into the structural and functional evolution of the HIF family, we characterized the HIF alpha gene from amphioxus, an invertebrate chordate, and identified several alternatively spliced HIF alpha isoforms. Whereas HIF alpha Ia, the full-length isoform, contained a complete oxygen-dependent degradation (ODD) domain, the isoforms Ib, Ic, and Id had 1 or 2 deletions in the ODD domain. When tagged with GFP and tested in mammalian cells, the amphioxus HIF alpha Ia protein level increased in response to hypoxia or CoCl2 treatment, whereas HIF alpha Ib, Ic, and Id showed reduced or no hypoxia regulation. Deletion of the ODD sequence in HIF alpha Ia up-regulated the HIF alpha Ia levels under normoxia. Gene expression analysis revealed HIF alpha Ic to be the predominant isoform in embryos and larvae, whereas isoform Ia was the most abundant form in the adult stage. The expression levels of Ib and Id were very low. Hypoxia treatment of adults had no effect on the mRNA levels of these HIF alpha isoforms. Functional analyses in mammalian cells showed all 4 HIF alpha isoforms capable of entering the nucleus and activating hypoxia response element-dependent reporter gene expression. The functional nuclear location signal (NLS) mapped to 3 clusters of basic residues. (775)KKARL functioned as the primary NLS, but (KRK)-K-737 and (KK)-K-754 also contributed to the nuclear localization. All amphioxus HIF alpha isoforms had 2 functional transactivation domains (TADs). Its C-terminal transactivation (C-TAD) shared high sequence identity with the human HIF-1 alpha and HIF-2 alpha C-TAD. This domain contained a conserved asparagine, and its mutation resulted in an increase in transcriptional activity. These findings reveal many ancient features of the HIF alpha family and provide novel insights into the evolution of the HIF alpha family.-Gao, S., Lu, L., Bai, Y., Zhang, P., Song, W., Duan, C.

The parabens used were methyl, ethyl, and propyl paraben. The experiments were conducted at influent paraben concentrations of 10 and 50 mg/L. The influent pH was measured around 4.6 because of paraben hydrolysis. The effluent pH increased due to hydrogen consumption and small molecular acid generation. The higher removal rates were observed for the paraben with longer alkyl chains, which were more hydrophobic and capable of penetrating into microbial cells. The co-existing organic constituents in municipal waste water were found to be competitive with paraben molecules for microbial degradation at low paraben loading (i.e., 10 mg/L). Instead, the co-metabolic effect was observed at a higher paraben loading (i.e., 50 mg/L) due to more active enzymatic catalysis, implying the possible enhancement or organic removal in the presence of high levels of parabens. The difference in BOD and TOC removing ratios for parabens decreased with increasing HRT, implying their better mineralization than that of municipal organic constituents. This was because the microbial organism became more adapted to the reacting system with longer HRT, and more oxygenase was produced to facilitate the catechol formation and ring-opening reactions, causing apparent enhancement in mineralization.

Ru(bpy)(3)(2+) and Ru(bpy)(2)(4,4'-(PO3H2)(2)bpy)(2+) (bpy = 2,2'-bipyridine) were employed as visible light sensitizers (abbreviated as Ru2+ and RuP2+, respectively). RuP2+, which is anchored by a covalent linkage to the NS-H4Nb6O17 surface, functions more efficiently than the electrostatically bound Ru2+ complex, because of more efficient electron injection from the excited sensitizer to NS-H4Nb6O17. RuP2+-sensitized NS-H4Nb6O17 and R-HCa2Nb3O10 both produce H-2 photocatalytically using visible light (lambda > 420 nm) with initial apparent quantum yields of 20-25%. At the optimum sensitizer concentration and Pt loading, the photochemical hydrogen evolution process is primarily limited by the efficiency of light absorption and charge injection from the photoexcited sensitizer into the oxide semiconductor particles. The dependence of the hydrogen evolution rate on Pt loading suggests that the scavenging of conduction band electrons by Pt is substantially faster than charge recombination or EDTA reduction of the oxidized sensitizer under optimized conditions.									135	4	0	0	14	0	137			1932-7447	1932-7455		WOS:000265687600072

It is revealed that the rate of hydrogen generation can be optimised by adding appropriate substituents to the tetraphenyl-porphyrin (TPP) molecule, with electron donating groups enhancing performance. Excellent electrocatalytic behaviour is evident with a Faradaic efficiency of about 90%. Turn over numbers (TON) of up to 100,000 for TPP and 250,000 for Methoxy-TPP are observed after 1 h of electrolysis. These electrodes are stable for at least 6 h and can be reused several times without reducing the TONs and Faradaic efficiency. The influence of substituents is discussed in terms of a scenario where the discharge of a hydronium ion by a ring nitrogen atom is apparently rate determining. This work reveals that metal-free macrocycles can be tuned to promote electrochemical water splitting, with the potential to offer cost-effective and sustainable alternatives to precious metal based electrocatalysts.

Four kilograms of soil amended with 1.2 kg of oil sludge was mixed with wood chips in a ratio of 1:2 (w:v) soil mixture:wood chips. The mixture was divided into five parts and four parts were separately mixed with pig, cow, horse or poultry manures in a ratio of 2:1 (w:w) and the fifth portion was used as the control with no manure added. All experiments were incubated for 10 months at room temperature. Compost piles were turned weekly for aeration and moisture level was maintained by adding deionised water enough to prevent the compost from getting dry. Moisture level, pH, temperature, CO2 evolution and oxygen consumption were measured monthly and the ash content of the compost at the end of experimentation. Highest temperature reached was 27.5 degrees C in all compost heaps, pH ranged from 5.5 to 7.8 and CO2 evolution was highest in poultry manure at 18.78 mu g/dwt/day. Microbial growth and activities were enhanced as indicated by increase in temperature, moisture level, pH value and respiration rate in all the compost piles. Bacteria capable of utilizing PAHs were isolated, purified and characterized by molecular techniques using polymerase chain reaction with specific universal primers and the amplicons were sequenced. Bacteria identified were Bacillus, Arthrobacter and Staphylococcus species. Percentage reduction in PAHs was measured using automated soxhlet extractor with Dichloromethane and gas chromatography/mass spectrometry. Results from PAH concentration measurements showed reduction of between 77% and 99%. Co-composting of contaminated soil with animal manures enhanced the reduction in PAHs.									1	0	0	0	1	0	1			2083-4772	2083-4810		WOS:000432610100009

This reactive element was incorporated using conventional alloying (0.05 or 0.1 wt%) and ion implantation. The materials containing alloyed yttrium were also implanted with yttrium to study the combined influence of volume and surface additions. A two-stage oxidation approach was applied with the use of O-18(2) as a tracer. The reaction temperature was 1100 degrees C and the samples were oxidised for up to 64 h.The scale growth mechanism was followed with the aid of in-depth distributions of the oxygen isotopes across the scale using secondary ion mass spectrometry, the surface morphology of the scales was observed using scanning electron microscopy, while their phase composition was determined using photoluminescence spectroscopy.Similar stages of the scale evolution were observed for the growing scales. Initially the oxide layer consisted of transient oxides, and at its surface more or less developed blade-like surface grains were observed. Subsequently, phase-transformation-related cracks and round patches appeared, and finally ridges which successively covered the outer surface of the scale and constituted the outer layer of a duplex scale developed. The mechanism of scale growth was a mixed outward and inward, and the relative contribution of both mechanisms varied depending on the analysed scale region and on the oxidation stage. The cracks and patches were regions where the transient aluminas were preferentially transformed into alpha-Al2O3. The ridges formed in cracks essentially consisted of alpha-Al2O3. For the initial stages of oxidation, the transient aluminas and alpha-Al2O3 co-existed in the scales, while subsequently the latter prevailed and finally, became the only phase found in the oxide layers.The evolution rate of the scale was affected by alloyed and implanted yttrium additions: the former exhibited minor and content-dependent effect while the latter significantly retarded it.									6	0	0	0	1	0	6			0960-3409	1878-6413		WOS:000306730100001

The aim of this work was to synthesize mixed Zn-Co oxides coatings that form a p-n heterostructure and explore the influence of morphology on its photoelectrochemical properties. Four different coatings were formed varying the rotation speed (1000, 1200 RPM) and Zn:Co ratio (1:2 and 1:1). The structure and morphology were investigated by X-ray diffraction (XRD) technique, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS). The analysis revealed that due to higher Co amount ZnCoO1 (Zn:Co 1:2, 1000 RPM) and ZnCoO2 (Zn:Co 1:2, 1200 RPM) coatings which consist of spinel-type oxides ZnCo2O4, Co3O4, they are more uniform, similar to 442 nm thick and contain lamellar morphology. Meanwhile, changing Zn:Co ratio to 1:1 in ZnCoO3 (1000 RPM) and ZnCoO4 (1200 RPM) leads to spinel (ZnCo2O4) formation, alters the morphology to granular, more rough, porous, uneven with 'hills' and 'valleys', and results in similar to 650 nm thick coatings. Photoelectrochemical activity tests proved high activity of deposited coatings at anodic potentials. The highest active surface area of 0.26 cm(2)and the highest activity were reached for ZnCoO3 coating: at 0.85 V vs. Ag,AgCl|KCl((sat))the incident-photon-to-current efficiency (IPCE) was 37% and the applied bias photon-to-current (ABPE) efficiency was - 5.91%. Thus, synthesized ZnCo(2)O(4)coating can be used as a future material for oxygen evolving reaction (OER).[GRAPHICS].									2	0	0	0	1	0	2			0947-8396	1432-0630		WOS:000562455300002

Reactive molecular dynamics simulations are a useful tool to examine the chemical reactions occurring in complex processes, providing that a realistic structural representation and an applicable reactive force field can be utilized. Combustion of coal (or biomass) char is one such area were additional insight would be helpful for utilization enhancements and pollution control. In this investigation a devolatilized Illinois No. 6 coal char atomistic representation was generated, using Fringe3D and additional Perl scripts, coupled with the ReaxFF reactive force field for hydrocarbon combustion. Fringe3D facilitates the char structure generation process by producing a distribution of aromatic structures based on HRTEM lattice fringe image analyses. Perl scripts were used for incorporating heteroatoms and aliphatic components to aid elimination of investigator bias, and facilitate a more rapid construction process. The char structure was constrained by a combination of elemental and NMR literature data. Chemical and physical parameters were found to be broadly consistent with the experimental data. The ReaxFF force field for hydrocarbon combustion was used to perform simulations to examine the structural transformations and chemical processes associated with char combustion. In this initial work, very high temperatures (3000-4000 K) were selected for ReaxFF simulation under stoichiometric, fuel lean and rich combustion conditions. These elevated temperatures were chosen to observe chemical reactions proceed to completion within a computationally practical simulation time. Analyses indicated that char oxidation process was primarily initialized by either thermal degradation of char structure to form small fragments, that were subsequently oxidized, or by hydrogen abstraction reactions by oxygen molecules and 0 and OH radicals. A more rapid oxidation and combustion of the polyaromatic structures occurred at fuel lean (oxygen rich) conditions compared with fuel rich combustion. Char transitions included 6-membered ring conversion into 5- and 7-membered rings that further decomposed or reacted with mostly O and OH radicals. This work further demonstrates the utility of ReaxFF force field integration with representative char structural models to investigate physical and chemical transformations of char structure during combustion at high-temperature conditions.

To determine the impact of dehydration temperatures on PPO action, as well as chemical and enzymatic oxidation reactions, apple PPO inactivation alone or with AA (1 mM) and/or chlorogenic acid (CG, 3 mM), as well as AA and CG levels evolution, during heating of the model solutions at 45 and 60 degrees C were investigated. At pH 3.8, PPO was still functional, keeping 61 and 4% residual activity after 2 h of heating at 45 and 60 degrees C, respectively. The combined treatment of heating and AA was more effective in reducing PPO activity, while incubation at 60 degrees C with AA and CG minimised the losses of PPO activity. CG remained stable during heating, even in the presence of AA which, in turn, was more affected by heating. Thus, during heating, provided PPO remained active with enough available O-2 in the model systems, CG oxidation and coupled oxidoreduction with AA could readily develop. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

MYCOSES				64	11			1412	1421		10.1111/myc.13291		MAY 2021		NOV 2021	2021	Background Biofilm formation on biotic and abiotic surfaces is finely regulated by genetic factors but also by oxygen concentration, pH, temperature and other environmental factors, already extensively explored for bacterial biofilms. Much less is known about fungal biofilm, that is considered a virulence factor for Candida pathogenic species among the few fungal species able to grow and survive at high temperatures such as 37 degrees C as well as those induced by fever. The resistance to high temperatures coupled with the ability to form biofilm are threatening factors of these fungal species that could severely impact at an epidemiological level.Objectives In this framework, we decided to study the thermal tolerance of biofilms formed by three medical relevant species such as Candida albicans and two non-Candida albicans Candida species.Methods Thirty nosocomial strains were investigated for their ability to adhere and grow in proximity and over body temperature (from 31 to 43 degrees C), mimicking different environmental conditions or severe febrile-like reactions.Results Candida sessile cells reacted to different temperatures showing a strain-specific response. It was observed that the attachment and growth respond differently to the temperature and that mechanism of adhesion has different outputs at high temperature than the growth.Conclusions This strain-dependent response is probably instrumental to guarantee the best success to cells for the infection, attachment and growth to occur. These observations reinforce the concept of temperature as a major trigger in the evolution of these species especially in this period of increasing environmental temperatures and excessive domestic heating.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0933-7407	1439-0507		WOS:000648475400001	33894074

The synthesis of COFs has significantly progressed with a very high potential for functionalization. Novel and advanced COF materials have gathered significant interest among researchers in this field due to their wide range of useful applications. Using COFs or COF-linked hybrid materials as photocatalysts is a rapidly developing area of research because they provide an exciting and challenging avenue for researchers to make scientific contributions to the preparation and photochemical application of COFs. In this review, the synthetic approaches and recent advances in the photocatalytic applications of COFs are presented. Various photocatalytic applications of COFs are discussed, including heterogeneous photocatalysis covering the topics of photocatalytic degradation and photocatalysis for organic transformations, carbon dioxide reduction and conversion into valuable materials and hydrogen evolution via water splitting. The maximum calculated quantum yield and space-time yield of 5.23E-03 molecules photon(-1) and 5.41E-04 molecules photon(-1) mg(-1), respectively, were demonstrated by the 2D porphyrin-based Por-sp(2)c-COF for the selective oxidation of amines to imines under visible light irradiation. Altogether, COF-based materials with diverse functionalities have prospects toward a range of environmental, industrial and commercial applications. (c) 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

Due to the introduction of local polar Zn-N-C configurations, with hypersensitivity for mechanical stress, the piezoelectricity is created on the nonpiezoelectric graphene, and the hierarchical ZnNG exhibits obvious piezocatalytic activity of water splitting for H-2 production even under mild agitation. The corresponding rate of H-2 production is about 14.65 mu mol g(-1) h(-1). It triggers a breakthrough in piezocatalytic H-2 evolution under low-frequency vibration, and takes a significant step forward for piezocatalysis towards practical applications. Furthermore, the presented concept of confining atomic polar configuration for engineering piezoelectricity would open up new horizon for constructing new-type piezoelectrics based on both piezoelectric and nonpiezoelectric materials.

J	Naidu, SL; DeLucia, EH								Acclimation of shade-developed leaves on saplings exposed to late-season canopy gaps								TREE PHYSIOLOGY				17	6			367	376						JUN 1997	1997	We hypothesized that photoinhibition of shade-developed leaves of deciduous hardwood saplings would limit their ability to acclimate photosynthetically to increased irradiance, and we predicted that shade-tolerant sugar maple (Acer saccharum Marsh.) would be more susceptible to photoinhibition than intermediately shade-tolerant red oak (Quercus rubra L.). After four weeks in a canopy gap, photosynthetic rates of shade-developed leaves of both species had increased in response to the increase in irradiance, although final acclimation was more complete in red oak. However, photoinhibition occurred in both species, as indicated by short-term reductions in maximum rates of net photosynthesis and the quantum yield of oxygen evolution, and longer-term reductions in the efficiency of excitation energy capture by open photosystem II (PSII) reaction centers (dark-adapted F-v/F-m) and the quantum yield of PSII in the light (phi(PSII)). The magnitude and duration of this decrease were greater in sugar maple than in red oak, suggesting greater susceptibility to photoinhibition in sugar maple. Photoinhibition may have resulted from photodamage, but it may also have involved sustained rates of photoprotective energy dissipation (especially in red oak). Photosynthetic acclimation also appeared to be linked to an ability to increase leaf nitrogen content. Limited photosynthetic acclimation in shade-developed sugar maple leaves may reflect a trade-off between shade-tolerance and rapid acclimation to a canopy gap.									76	1	0	0	67	0	77			0829-318X	1758-4469		WOS:A1997XC79900003	14759845

Here, the formation and evolution of secondary organic aerosol (SOA) was evaluated using an Aerodyne high-resolution time-of-flight aerosol mass spectrometer at an urban site in Beijing from 1 to 30 September 2015. The submicron aerosol particles were dominated by organics (accounting for an average of 43.2% of the total mass), followed by nitrate (19.8%), sulfate (19.2%), ammonium (10.2%), black carbon (BC) (8.5%) and chloride (L4%). Positive matrix factorization of high-resolution organic aerosol mass spectra identified two oxygenated organic aerosol (OOA) components: a less oxidized OOA (LO-OOA) and a more oxidized OOA (MO-OOA). The mass concentrations of MO-OOA and LO-OOA correlated well with the odd oxygen (Ox = O-3+nitrogen dioxide (NO2)), with slopes of 1.15 mu g m(-3) per 10 ppb Ox and 0.48 mu g m(-3) per 10 ppb Ox, respectively, suggesting the important role of photochemical processing in OOA production. In addition, aqueous-phase processing was also observed to contribute substantially to MO-OOA production when RH > 60%, and RH suppressed LO-OOA formation. Further episode analysis showed that the gas-phase reaction was the main driving force for organic oxidation during the initial pollution stage, during which LO-OOA gradually transformed to MO-OOA as indicated by an increase in the most oxidized ion (COI) and a decrease in a moderately oxidized ion (C2H3O+). Compared with the initial pollution stage, gas-phase oxidation was largely enhanced during the daytime in the peak pollution stage which showed a stronger dependence of MO-OOA on Ox concentration. In addition, enhanced aqueous-phase oxidation and the partitioning process both contributed to the incorporation of oxygenated species into the particle phase during the nighttime in the presence of high aerosol water content.									26	2	0	0	15	0	26			1352-2310	1873-2844		WOS:000501407200009		
J	KROMER, S; MALMBERG, G; GARDESTROM, P								MITOCHONDRIAL CONTRIBUTION TO PHOTOSYNTHETIC METABOLISM - A STUDY WITH BARLEY (HORDEUM-VULGARE L) LEAF PROTOPLASTS AT DIFFERENT LIGHT INTENSITIES AND CO2 CONCENTRATIONS								PLANT PHYSIOLOGY				102	3			947	955		10.1104/pp.102.3.947				JUL 1993	1993	An oligomycin concentration that specifically inhibits oxidative Phosphorylation was added to isolated barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) leaf protoplasts at various irradiances and carbon dioxide concentrations. At saturating as well as low light intensities, photosynthetic oxygen evolution was decreased as a result of the oligomycin treatment, whereas no effect was observed at intermediate light intensities. This was the same for photorespiratory and nonphotorespiratory conditions. These results were confirmed by measurements of fluorescence quenching under the same conditions. Metabolite analysis in the presence of oligomycin revealed a drastic decrease in the mitochondrial and cytosolic ATP/ADP ratios, whereas there was little or no effect on the chloroplastic ratio. Concomitantly, sucrose phosphate synthase activity was reduced. Under high irradiances, this inhibition of sucrose synthesis by oligomycin apparently caused a feedback inhibition on the Calvin cycle and the photosynthetic activity. Under low irradiances, a feedback regulation compensated, indicating that light was more limiting than the activity of regulative enzymes. Thus, the importance of mitochondrial respiratory activity might be different in different metabolic situations. At saturating light, the oxidation of excess photosynthetic redox equivalents is required to sustain a high rate of photosynthesis. At low light, the supply of ATP to the cytosol might be required to support biosynthetic reactions.									91	2	0	0	82	0	93			0032-0889	1532-2548		WOS:A1993LM87700030	12231880

Atomic-scale heterojunction-type photocatalysts are regarded as a promising and effective strategy to overcome the drawbacks of traditional photocatalysts for higher photoenergy conversion efficiencies. Herein, an atomic-scale heterojunction composed of a boron nitride monolayer and graphene (h-BN-C/G) is constructed to significantly shorten the charge transfer path to promote the activation of molecular oxygen for artificial photosynthesis (exemplified with oxidative coupling of amines to imines). As the thinnest heterojunction, h-BN-C/G gives the highest conversion, which is eightfold higher than that of the mechanical mixture of graphene and boron nitride monolayers. h-BN-C/G exhibits a high turnover frequency value (4.0 mmol benzylamine g(-1) h(-1)), which is 2.5-fold higher than that of the benchmark metal-free photocatalyst in the literature under even critical conditions.									43	4	0	0	2	0	43			2198-3844			WOS:000439842100025	30027039

However, it remains controversial if slab-driven metal addition is effective and whether it occurs at all stages of subduction. The Izu-Bonin-Mariana (IBM) forearc preserves a full record of arc development from the initiation of subduction of the Pacific plate to mature arc volcanism. Here, we study the ore-forming and redox-sensitive metal Cu and its isotopes (delta Cu-65) in the type-locality forearc basalts (FABs), boninites and high-Mg andesites from the IBM forearc, as well as MORBs from the East Pacific rise. Overall, the FABs display variably high Cu contents and MORB-like delta Cu-65, consistent with limited Cu isotopic fractionation during partial melting of typical MORB mantle sources. Beginning with the boninites, the magma products from the IBM record strong slab signals, high water contents and high fO(2) (Delta FMQ > +1). However, the oxidized, hydrous boninites and subsequent high-Mg andesites display low Cu contents, and mantle-like Cu/Sc ratios and delta Cu-65, with no clear indication of the addition of Cu from the slab. The boninites show noticeably lower TiO2, Yb and Cu contents than the FABs, consistent with refractory mantle sources. Combined with available data from boninites and arc basalts worldwide, our results lead to a general conclusion that subducted oceanic slabs from initial to mature subduction contribute little Cu to the mantle wedge. This is further supported by the compiled Cu contents of arc peridotites. Adding Cu-poor, water-rich slab melts to the mantle wedge at any stage of Pacific oceanic subduction causes limited release of Cu, which remains trapped predominantly by reduced sulfides in the subducting slab. This likely reflects the overall reducing nature of slab materials added to the mantle wedge. However, we propose that the subsequent reaction of such reducing, hydrous slab melts with peridotites and flux melting produce oxidized primitive arc magmas deep in the mantle wedge. The reactive process promotes sulfide dissolution and metal release from the mantle wedge itself to oxidized arc magmas with high sulfur solubility, which explains the inheritance of mantle-like delta Cu-65 and the sulfide-undersaturated early-stage evolution in boninites and arc basalts. This study elucidates the role of subducted oceanic slabs in metal transfer and redox evolution and implies no significant Cu enrichment in the metasomatized mantle sources of magmatic arcs.

These two methods provide information about the distribution of compounds as well as conductivity. A correlation of these two techniques reveals that not all conductive material contributes equally to the overall conductivity. Furthermore, the coating was examined with respect to its spatially resolved electrocatalytic activity towards the evolution of chlorine and oxygen which are the main active molecules generated during electrochemical stress. The comparison of the very same area showed electrocatalytically active hot spots with higher rate of generation of these species compared to the value averaged over the electrode area, and the results correlate to conductivity and graphite particle distribution.									11	1	0	0	1	0	11			1572-6657	1873-2569		WOS:000403117500009

It has been suggested that bicarbonate functions by providing ligands to the non-heme iron and by facilitating protonation of the secondary plastoquinone Q(B). Numerous lines of evidence indicate an intimate relationship of bicarbonate and formate binding of PSII, To investigate the potential amino acid binding environment of bicarbonate/formate in the Q(B) niche, arginine 257 of the PSII D1 polypeptide in the unicellular green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii was mutated into a glutamate (D1-R257E) and a methionine (DQ-R257M). The two mutants share the following characteristics. (1) Both have a drastically reduced sensitivity to formate. (2) A larger fraction of Q(A)(-) persists after flash illumination, which indicates an altered equilibrium constant of the reaction Q(A)(-)Q(B) <----> Q(A)Q(B)(-) in the direction of [Q(A)(-)], or a larger fraction of non-Q(B) centers. However, there appears to be no significant difference in the rate of electron transfer from Q(A)(-) to Q(B), (3) The overall rate of oxygen evolution is significantly reduced, most likely due to changes in the equilibrium constant on the electron acceptor side of PSII or due to a larger fraction in non-Q(B) centers. Additional effects on the donor side cannot yet be excluded. (4) The binding affinity for the herbicide DCMU is unaltered. (5) The mutants grow photosynthetically, but at a decreased (similar to 70% of the wild type) level. (6) The F-0 level was elevated (similar to 40-50%) which could be due to a decrease in the excitation energy transfer from the antenna to the PSII reaction center, and/or to an increased level of [Q(A)(-)] in the dark. (7) A decreased (similar to 10%) ratio of F685 (mainly from CP43) and F695 (mainly from CP47) to F715 (mainly from PSI) emission bands at 77 K suggests a change in the antenna complex. Taken together these results lead to the conclusion that D1-R257 with the positively charged side chain is important for the fully normal functioning of PSII and of growth, and is specially critical for the in vivo binding of formate. Several alternatives are discussed to explain the almost normal functioning of the D1-R257E and D1-R257M mutants. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V.

J	Yoon, Seon Hye; Park, Yong Joon								Polyimide-coated carbon electrodes combined with redox mediators for superior Li-O-2 cells with excellent cycling performance and decreased overpotential								SCIENTIFIC REPORTS				7						42617	10.1038/srep42617				FEB 15 2017	2017	We report an air electrode employing polyimide-coated carbon nanotubes (CNTs) combined with a redox mediator for Li-O-2 cells with enhanced electrochemical performance. The polyimide coating on the carbon surface suppresses unwanted side reactions, which decreases the amount of accumulated reaction products on the surface of the air electrode during cycling. The redox mediators lower the overpotential of the Li-O-2 cells because they can easily transfer electrons from the electrode to the reaction products. The low overpotential can also decrease the side reactions that activate at a high potential range. Specifically, the CsI redox mediator effectively interrupted dendrite growth on the Li anode during cycling due to the shielding effect of its Cs+ ions and acted as a redox mediator due to its I-ions. LiNO3 also facilitates the decrease in side reactions and the stabilization of the Li anode. The synergic effect of the polyimide coating and the electrolyte containing the LiNO3/CsI redox mediator leads to a low overpotential and excellent cycling performance (over 250 cycles with a capacity of 1,500 mAh.g(electrode)(-1)).									16	0	0	0	3	0	16			2045-2322			WOS:000394250300001	28198419

Here, molybdate modification cooperates with LDH interlayer carbonate anion to construct atomic level coupled heterostructure (NFCH-NMO), and the resulting strong electron interaction at the two-phase interface to directly optimize the electronic structure and d-band center of NiFe-based catalyst. Owing to the high-energy phase boundary effect and the rapid mass transfer advantages of the 3D mesoporous super hydrophilic surface, the as-prepared NFCH-NMO exhibits remarkable oxygen and hydrogen evolution reaction (OER/HER) catalytic activity, with low overpotentials of 219/203 and 289/297 mV at 50 and 500 mA.cm(-2), respectively. The alkaline water electrolyzer of NFCH-NMO || NFCH-NMO only requires a cell potential of 1.66 and 1.839 V to reach 50 and 500 mA.cm(-2). This work provides a well-defined catalyst for EOWS at high current density and shows the interfacial engineering of heterostructure with the high-energy interface effect via synergistic modification of LDH interlayer carbonate anion and molybdate is a suitable strategy to enhance the internal electrocatalytic performance of NiFe based catalysts.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000817861600002		
J	Sorokhtin, OG; Ushakov, SA								Ocean influence on the atmosphere composition and climates of the Earth								OKEANOLOGIYA				38	6			928	937						NOV-DEC 1998	1998	It is shown, that it is necessary to consider the development of the atmosphere and hydrosphere on the Earth as an evolution of a unified system with direct correlation and feedback between these geospheres. In particular, it is shown, that the composition and pressure of the atmosphere essentially depend on the position of the ocean surface in relation to the level of rift zones on the crests of mid-oceanic ridges (where reactions of hydratation of mantle rocks and fixing carbon dioxide into carbonates occur) and-also on the content of free iron in the Earth mantle. In addition, it was taken into account, that the nitrogen was partially removed from the atmosphere to sediments and buried there. As a result, Archeozoic, there was a dense carbon dioxide - nitrogen atmosphere, during the Archeozoic, in the Proterozoic its composition became nitrogenous, and in the Phanerozoic it became nitrogen-oxygenous. According to this, the Archeozoic climate was hot with average temperatures of T-s approximate to approximate to +70...+80 degrees C. In the Proterozoic the climate became cool T-s approximate to +7...+10 degrees C, in the Phanerozoic the climate became moderately warm with the maximum temperatures in the Mesozoic T-s = 17 degrees C and the modern average temperature equal to T-s approximate to 15 degrees C.									2	0	2	0	1	0	4			0030-1574			WOS:000078286200016

The flow of excitation energy and electrons in the photosynthetic apparatus needs to be continuously modulated to respond to dynamics of environmental conditions, and Flavodiiron (FLV) proteins are seminal components of this regulatory machinery in cyanobacteria. FLVs were lost during evolution by flowering plants, but are still present in nonvascular plants such as Physcomitrella patens. We generated P. patens mutants depleted in FLV proteins, showing their function as an electron sink downstream of photosystem I for the first seconds after a change in light intensity. flv knock-out plants showed impaired growth and photosystem I photoinhibition when exposed to fluctuating light, demonstrating FLV's biological role as a safety valve from excess electrons on illumination changes. The lack of FLVs was partially compensated for by an increased cyclic electron transport, suggesting that in flowering plants, the FLV's role was taken by other alternative electron routes.									101	0	0	0	95	0	101			0027-8424			WOS:000386087100086	27791022

Typically 10 to 20 thermal pulses have been followed for each TP-AGB object. This homogeneous and quite large set of models allows us to present an overview of the thermal pulse properties as well as of the nucleosynthesis accompanying the TP-AGB phase of intermediate-mass stars.More specifically after a brief description of the previous evolutionary stages, predictions are given for the isotopic ratios involving C, N, O, Ne, Mg, Al and Si. Also the surface abundances of Li-7, F-19 and Na-23 are reported. As the asymptotic phase of the thermal pulses has been reached for each star, we also indicate how these abundances will probably evolve until the stars completely loose their envelope, by including the evolution of the nucleosynthesis itself.									195	1	0	0	1	0	196			0365-0138			WOS:A1997XE07600004

The effect of molecular structure and fluorine substitution on their catalytic activity was investigated. It was found that the linear non-fluorinated polymer L-PyBT exhibited the highest hydrogen evolution rate up to 83.7 mol h(-1) under visible light irradiation among the prepared polymers because of its broad light absorption, suitable energy bandgap, and enhanced charge generation and separation process.									39	2	0	0	0	0	40			1759-9954	1759-9962		WOS:000445220900006

This fascinating question has remained a subject of great interest in studying metabolic specialization in microorganisms. The Crabtree effect - i.e., the ability of some microorganisms to switch from respiration to fermentation in the presence of oxygen - is an appropriate case study to address the aforementioned question. Game-theoretical approaches have been routinely used to examine and explain the way a microorganism, such as yeast, would switch between the two ATP-producing pathways, i.e., respiration and fermentation. Here we attempt to explain the switch between respiration and fermentation in yeast by constructing a simple metabolic switch. We then utilize an individual-based model, in which each individual is equipped with all the relevant chemical reactions, to see how cells equipped with such metabolic switch would behave in different conditions. We further investigate our proposed metabolic switch using the game-theoretical approach. Based on this model, we postulate that the population-level metabolic heterogeneity in microorganisms can simply arise from individuals utilizing a mixed strategy. (C) 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

The isothermal oxidation behavior of the alloy has been investigated in static air at 950 degrees C for 100 h. X-ray diffractometry (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) were applied to study the microstructural evolution. The results reveal that the carburized layer, with a thickness of 7.4 mu m, is composed of nanostructured Ti2AlC and Ti3AlC phases. The oxidation weight gain of the carburized TiAl is half of that of the bare TiAl. The oxide scale of the carburized TiAl is compact without delamination and spallation. The inward diffusion of oxygen atom was hindered due to the existence of the carburized layer.

In this study, a series of high-entropy RE2(Y0.2Yb0.2Nb0.2Ta0.2Ce0.2)(2)O-7 (RE = La, Nd, Sm, Gd, Dy, and Er) oxides were prepared though solid-state reaction. Through tuning the rare-earth cations, an order-disorder transition occurs from certain partially ordered weberite structure (C222(1)) to disordered defective fluorite structure (Fm3 over bar $\bar{3}$m). All the high-entropy RE2(Y0.2Yb0.2Nb0.2Ta0.2Ce0.2)(2)O-7 oxides possess low thermal conductivity in the range of 0.91-1.34 W m(-1) K-1 at room temperature, which can be attributed to increased lattice anharmonicity and disorder, resulting in additional phonon scattering. Herein, we proved that the incorporation of heterovalent cations at B-sites in high-entropy A(2)B(2)O(7) crystals is an effective strategy to reduce the thermal conductivity without compromising the decrease of oxygen vacancy. Moreover, the high-entropy RE2(Y0.2Yb0.2Nb0.2Ta0.2Ce0.2)(2)O-7 oxides show the relatively higher thermal expansion coefficients of 10.3-10.7 x 10(-6)degrees C-1 and excellent phase stability at elevated temperatures.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0002-7820	1551-2916		WOS:000787238200001

The XRD patterns of the as-synthesized samples indicate the formation of barium/strontium monoferrite ((Ba/Sr)Fe2O4) and maghemite (gamma-Fe2O3) phases along with a minute amount of hematite (alpha-Fe2O3) phase. Annealing of these samples facilitates formation of BSFO phase through the solid state reaction between BaFe2O4 and gamma-Fe2O3 phase. Interestingly, after annealing the samples with x = 0, 0.5 and 1, at 1000 degrees C for 2 h, we observed that phase pure Ba-Sr hexaferrite structure forms, but for samples with x = 0.25 and 0.75, high amount of hematite (alpha-Fe2O3) phase is observed, especially for x = 0.75. The reason associated with this could be the large difference between the ionic radii of Ba2+ and Sr2+ ions occupying the oxygen site. Furthermore, our study on annealing dependent phase evolution confirms that, this difference in ionic radii forbids the formation of a single phase Ba-Sr hexaferrite. The growth of clear hexagonal-shaped plate-like particles with varied particle sizes was observed for all the samples. The particle size variation may be due to the influence of the ionic radii difference on the sinterability of the samples. Our study provides a better understanding of synthesis mechanism of Ba-Sr hexaferrite samples.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			0272-8842	1873-3956		WOS:000635539800002

The spectra cover the range from 3300 angstrom to 6800 angstrom and exhibit several broad absorptions, exclusively due to CIV and OVI lines. The new model atmosphere grid utilized covers T(eff) = 140 000 K-300 000 K and log g = 7-9 at various element mixtures of H, He, C, and 0. Since evolutionary considerations predict the presence of neon, we investigate its influence on the atmosphere in two exploratory models, which for the first time include neon self-consistently. The effects of neon opacities onto the emergent fluxes of H 1504 + 65 and PG 1159-035 turn out to be negligible.The result of our analysis reveals that H 1504 + 65 is the hottest star ever analysed by model atmosphere techniques (T(eff) = 170 000 K +/- 20 000 K), along with a high surface gravity (log g = 8 +/- 0.5). Most intriguing, however, is the atmospheric composition of H 1504 + 65. It is solely made up of carbon and oxygen by equal parts (mass fractions), and it is virtually devoid of hydrogen and helium (He < 1%). It is most plausible to interpret H 1504 + 65 as an extreme PG 1159 star, i.e., as a pre-white dwarf that has lost its entire H and He envelopes as a consequence of a late He shell flash. Its mass (M/M. = 0.86 +/- 0.15) is considerably higher than the mean mass of white dwarfs and the PG 1159 stars (about 0.6M.). Accordingly, H 1504 + 65 represents the naked core of a former AGB red giant which gives us the unique opportunity to "probe" directly the thermonuclear C-12(alpha, gamma) O-16 reaction rate. This rate is still highly uncertain but nevertheless of crucial importance for all late stages of stellar evolution.									57	0	0	0	0	0	57			0004-6361			WOS:A1991GM77600022

Defence mechanisms of seaweeds, however, have mostly been investigated by mimicking infection using elicitors. We have established an experimental pathosystem between the genome brown model seaweed Ectocarpus siliculosus and the oomycete Eurychasma dicksonii as a powerful new tool to investigate algal responses to infection. Using proteomics, we identified 21 algal proteins differentially accumulated in response to Eu. dicksonii infection. These include classical algal stress response proteins such as a manganese superoxide dismutase, heat shock proteins 70 and a vanadium bromoperoxidase. Transcriptional profiling by qPCR confirmed the induction of the latter during infection. The accumulation of hydrogen peroxide was observed at different infection stages via histochemical staining. Inhibitor studies confirmed that the main source of hydrogen peroxide is superoxide converted by superoxide dismutase. Our data give an unprecedented global overview of brown algal responses to pathogen infection, and highlight the importance of oxidative stress and halogen metabolism in these interactions. This suggests overlapping defence pathways with herbivores and abiotic stresses. We also identify previously unreported actors, in particular a Rad23 and a plastid-lipid-associated protein, providing novel insights into the infection and defence processes in brown algae.									20	0	0	0	18	0	22			0140-7791	1365-3040		WOS:000370137300004	25764246

In these organisms, photosynthetic water splitting is functionally linked to H-2 production by the activity of hydrogenase enzymes. Interestingly, each of these organisms contains only one of two major types of hydrogenases, [FeFe] or [NiFe] enzymes, which are phylogenetically distinct but perform the same catalytic reaction, suggesting convergent evolution. This idea is supported by the observation that each of the two classes of hydrogenases has a different metallo-cluster, is encoded by entirely different sets of genes (apparently under the control of different promoter elements), and exhibits different maturation pathways. The genetics, biosynthesis, structure, function, and O-2 sensitivity of these enzymes have been the focus of extensive research in recent years. Some of this effort is clearly driven by the potential for using these enzymes in future biological or biohybrid systems to produce renewable fuel or in fuel cell applications.									264	5	1	0	172	0	270			1543-5008	1545-2123		WOS:000247703600005	17150028

Microbial symbioses facilitated plant colonization of land by enhancing nutrient uptake leading to improved plant growth and fitness. In addition, early land plants acquired novel defense mechanisms to protect plant tissues from pre-existing microbial pathogens. Due to its evolutionary stage linking unicellular green algae to vascular plants, the non-vascular moss Physcomitrella patens is an interesting organism to explore the adaptation mechanisms developed in the evolution of plant defenses to microbes. Cellular and biochemical approaches, gene expression profiles, and functional analysis of genes by targeted gene disruption have revealed that several defense mechanisms against microbial pathogens are conserved between mosses and flowering plants. P. patens perceives pathogen associated molecular patterns by plasma membrane receptor(s) and transduces the signal through a MAP kinase (MAPK) cascade leading to the activation of cell wall associated defenses and expression of genes that encode proteins with different roles in plant resistance. After pathogen assault, P. patens also activates the production of ROS, induces a HR-like reaction and increases levels of some hormones. Furthermore, alternative metabolic pathways are present in P. patens leading to the production of a distinct metabolic scenario than flowering plants that could contribute to defense. P. patens has acquired genes by horizontal transfer from prokaryotes and fungi, and some of them could represent adaptive benefits for resistance to biotic stress. In this review, the current knowledge related to the evolution of plant defense responses against pathogens will be discussed, focusing on the latest advances made in the model plant P. patens.									34	0	0	0	29	0	34			1664-462X			WOS:000396252600001	28360923

Recent worldwide genome analyses and animal experiments have reported dozens of genes associated with cold adaptation. The uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1) gene enhances thermogenesis reaction in a physiological process by blocking ATP (adenosine triphosphate) synthesis on a mitochondrial membrane in brown adipose tissues. To our knowledge, no previous studies have shown an association between variants of the UCP1 gene and physiological phenotypes concerning non-shivering thermogenesis (NST) under the condition of low temperature in humans. We showed that the degree of NST for healthy subjects in an artificial climate chamber is significantly different among UCP1 genotypes. Defining the haplotypes covering the UCP1 region (39.4 kb), we found that the frequency of the haplotype with the highest NST was significantly correlated with latitudes and ambient temperature. Thus, the data in this study provide the first evidence that the UCP1 genotype alters the efficiency of NST in humans, and likely supports the hypothesis that the UCP1 gene has been related to cold adaptation in human evolutionary history.									17	0	0	0	12	0	17			2045-2322			WOS:000405675400050	28717127

In our previous studies, the PEC performance of polyaniline-WO3 (PANI-W) nanocomposite was confirmed as a high-performance organic-inorganic photoelectrocatalyst. In this research, we modified polyaniline-WO3 photoelectrocatalyst with (6, 6)-phenyl-C-61-butyric acid methyl ester (PC61BM) as an efficient fullerene derivative with high electron -accepting capability and excellent electron mobility for solar-induced water oxidation. The as-synthesized compounds were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy, Scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Transmission electron microscopy (TEM), Energy -dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The electrochemical measurements showed that the activity of PC61BM modified polyaniline-WO3 toward water electro-oxidation enhanced. A photocurrent density of 1.63 mAcm(-2;) 2 at 1.23 V vs. RHE achieved for PANI-W-PCBM indicating similar to 2.5-fold improvement compared to that of PANI-W. Furthermore, the charge transfer resistance (Rct) of PANIW-PCBM at electrode/electrolyte interface under light irradiation is 433 Omega cm(2) which is 5.64 times lower than that of PANI-W (2441 Omega cm(2)). The modification of PANI-W nanocomposite with PC61BM suppressed the recombination of photogenerated electrons and holes and provided more active sites for oxygen evolution reaction due to the outstanding electrical conductivity, carrier mobility, and large surface area of PC61BM. Therefore, modification of organic-inorganic nanocomposite with conjugated carbon-based materials increased the PEC water splitting activity.									5	1	0	0	0	0	5			1369-8001	1873-4081		WOS:000585290500004

Initially, a large kinetic isotopic fractionation takes place between HSO4- and S, followed by a slow approach to equilibrium. The equilibrium fractionation factors, estimated from the longest run results, are expressed by 1000 ln alpha(HSO4)(-)-s = 6.21 x 10(6)/T-2 + 3.62. The rates at which the initial kinetic fractionation factors approach the equilibrium ones were evaluated at the experimental conditions. delta(34)S values of HSO4- and elemental sulfur were examined far active crater lakes including Noboribetsu and Niseko, (Hokkaido, Japan), Khloridnoe, Bannoe and Mary Semiachik (Kamchatka), Poas (Costa Rica), Ruapehu (New Zealand) and Kawah Ijen and Keli Mutu (Indonesia). Delta HSO4--S values are 28 parts per thousand for Keli Mutu, 26 parts per thousand for Kawah Ijen, 24 parts per thousand for Ruapehu, 23 parts per thousand for Poas, 22 parts per thousand for Maly Semiachik, 21 parts per thousand for Yugama, 13 parts per thousand for Bannoe, 9 parts per thousand for Niseko, 4 parts per thousand for Khloridonoe, and 0 parts per thousand for Noboribetsu, in the decreasing order. The SO2 disproportionation reaction in the magmatic hydrothermal system below crater lakes where magmatic gases condense is responsible for high Delta HSO4--S values, whereas contribution of HSO4- produced through bacterial oxidation of reduced sulfur becomes progressively dominant for lakes with lower Delta HSO4--S values. Currently, Noboribetsu crater lake contains no HSO4 of magmatic origin. A 40-year period observation of delta(34)SHO(4)(-) and delta(34)S(s) values at Yugama indicated that the isotopic variations reflect changes in the supply rate of SO2 to the magmatic hydrothermal system. This implies a possibility of Volcano monitoring by continuous observation of delta(34)HSO(4)(-) values. The delta(18)O values of HSO4- and lake water from the studied lakes covary, indicating oxygen isotopic equilibration between them. The covariance gives strong evidence that lake water circulates through the sublimnic zone at temperatures of 140 +/- 30 degrees C. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

However, construction of a highly active surface layer with synergistic sites toward alkaline hydrogen evolution still remains challenging. Herein, a strategy of incomplete amorphous phosphorization at the surface of crystalline cobalt molybdate is proposed to realize the interface engineering of crystalline cobalt molybdate surrounded by the amorphous cobalt phosphide (CoMoO4@a-CoPx). The synergy of a-CoPx and crystalline CoMoO4 nanoparticles in the shell of the nanocomposite leads to a low overpotential of 74.7 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) and small Tafel slope of 64 mV dec(-1) toward alkaline hydrogen evolution, superior to single-phase CoMoO4 and CoPx electrocatalysts. The amorphous CoPx in the shell provides highly catalytically active sites, while the presence of crystalline CoMoO4 effectively regulates electron transfer into the active sites. The unique structure brings about more suitable water dissociation energy and hydrogen desorption energy, and prevents the deactivation of active sites, thereby promoting the catalytic activity. This work could offer alternative options for the development of efficient hydrogen evolution catalysts in an alkaline solution.									3	0	0	0	1	0	3			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000695662500001

High-temperature phase evolution of the nanocomposites reveals that free carbon (C-free) plays a crucial role in the in situ formation of the NP, indicating that the microstructure of the nanocomposites can be tailored via molecular design of the single-source precursors. Compared with SiC/C-free and MoSi2/SiC/C-free nanocomposites obtained under the same conditions, the Mo4.8Si3C0.6/SiC/C-free nanocomposites exhibit significantly enhanced EMW absorbing performance. A minimum reflection loss (RL) of -59 dB was achieved at 8 GHz for the thickness of 2.46 mm, proving the superiority of the Mo4.8Si3C0.6/SiC/C-free nanocomposite as an outstanding EMW absorbing material. On the basis of our previous discovery that the Mo4.8Si3C0.6 embedded in a SiC-based matrix with high specific surface area exhibits excellent electrocatalytic properties suitable for the electrochemical hydrogen evolution reaction, the present results prove that Mo4.8Si3C0.6/SiC/C-free nanocomposites have to be considered as novel multifunctional materials with tailorable microstructure and excellent performance in two different fields including electrochemical water splitting and EMW absorption.									9	1	0	0	0	0	9			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000526583500099	32182413

Particularly, electrically rechargeable Zn-air battery technologies are of great importance for bulk applications like electric vehicles, grid management, and portable electronic devices. Nevertheless, Zn-air batteries are still not competitive enough to realize widespread practical adoption because of issues in efficiency, durability, and cycle life. Here, following an introduction to the fundamentals and performance testing techniques, the latest research progress related to electrically rechargeable Zn-air batteries is compiled, particularly new key findings in the last five years (2013-2018). The strategies concerning the development of Zn and air electrodes are in focus. The design of other battery components, namely electrolytes and separators are also discussed. Poor performance of O-2 electrocatalysts and the lack of the long-term stability of Zn electrodes and electrolytes remain major challenges. Finally, recommendations regarding the testing routines and materials design are provided. It is hoped that this up-to-date account will help to shape the future research activities toward the development of practical electrically rechargeable Zn-air batteries with extended lifetime and superior performance.									133	9	0	0	1	0	136			1613-6810	1613-6829		WOS:000452144000001	30160051

However, to improve the properties and optimize the chemical composition of nanostructures deposited in this way, the electron stimulated decomposition of the organometallic precursors must be better understood. To address this issue, we have employed an ultrahigh vacuum-surface science approach to study the electron induced reactions of dimethyl-(acetylacetonate) gold (III) [Au-III(acac)Me-2] adsorbed onto solid substrates. Using thin molecular films adsorbed onto cooled substrates, surface reactions, reaction kinetics, and gas phase products were studied in the incident energy regime between 40 and 1500 eV using a combination of x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), reflection absorption infrared spectroscopy (RAIRS), and mass spectrometry (MS). XPS and RAIRS data indicate that electron irradiation of Au-III(acac)Me-2 is accompanied by the reduction in Au-III to a metallic Au-0 species embedded in a dehydrogenated carbon matrix, while MS reveals the concomitant evolution of methane, ethane, carbon monoxide, and hydrogen. The electron stimulated decomposition of Au-III(acac)Me-2 is first-order with respect to the surface coverage of the organometallic precursor, and exhibits a rate constant that is proportional to the electron flux. At an incident electron energy of 520 eV, the total reaction cross section was similar to 3.6 x 10(-16) cm(2). As a function of the incident electron energy, the maximum deposition yield was observed at approximate to 175 eV. The structure of discrete Au-containing deposits formed at room temperature by rastering an electron beam across a highly ordered pyrolytic graphite substrate in the presence of a constant partial pressure of Au-III(acac)Me-2 was also investigated by atomic force microscopy.

FEBS LETTERS				463	3			199	204		10.1016/S0014-5793(99)01536-7				DEC 17 1999	1999	Internal proton displacements in several membrane photosynthetic enzymes are analyzed in relation to general mechanisms of enzymatic catalysis, In the bacterial photosynthetic reaction center (RC) and in bacteriorhodopsin (BR), carboxy residues (Glu-212 in the RC L-subunit and Asp-96 in BR) serve as indispensable intrinsic proton donors. Both carboxyls are protonated prior to the proton-donation step, because their pK values are shifted to greater than or equal to 12.0 by the interaction with the protein and/or substrate. In both cases, the proton transfer reactions are preceded by conformational changes that, supposedly, let water interact with the carboxyls. These changes snitch over the pK values of the carboxyls to less than or equal to 6.0 and 7.1 in the RC and BR, respectively. The sharp increase in the proton-donating ability of the carboxyls drives the reaction cycles. This kind of catalytic mechanism, where a strong general acid or base emerges, when needed, as a result of a conformational change can be denoted as a conformationally controlled pK-switching. Generally, the ability of enzymes to go between isoenergetic conformations that differ widely in the reactivity of the catalytic group(s) may be of crucial importance to the understanding of enzymatic catalysis, Particularly; the pK-switching concept could help to reconcile the contradictory views on the functional protonation state of the redox-active tyrosine Y-Z in the oxygen-evolving photosystem II. It is conceivable that Y-Z switches its pK from similar to 4.5 to greater than or equal to 10.0 upon the last, rate-limiting step of mater oxidation, By turning into a strong base, tyrosine assists then in abstracting a proton from the bound substrate water and helps to drive the dioxygen formation.

Apart from the role of stabilizer, PDDA plays the role of a shape directing agent as well as an oxidative etchant in conjunction with dissolved oxygen. The edge length of the nanoplates was determined to be about 15 mu m, and atomic force microscopy investigations proved that the nanoplates are concave, with thickness at the centre being about 10 nm. X-ray diffraction studies and selected area electron diffraction investigations confirmed that the nanoplates are bound by the {111} plane. The nanoplates were also characterized by energy-dispersive X-ray analysis and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			1388-0764			WOS:000318551300027

Fully 3D simulations								JOURNAL OF COMPUTATIONAL PHYSICS				231	3	SI		1020	1050		10.1016/j.jcp.2011.07.023				FEB 1 2012	2012	We recently have presented first physical predictions of a spatially hybrid model that follows the evolution of a negative streamer discharge in full three spatial dimensions; our spatially hybrid model couples a particle model in the high field region ahead of the streamer with a fluid model in the streamer interior where electron densities are high and fields are low. Therefore the model is computationally efficient, while it also follows the dynamics of single electrons including their possible run-away. Here we describe the technical details of our computations, and present the next step in a systematic development of the simulation code. First, new sets of transport coefficients and reaction rates are obtained from particle swarm simulations in air, nitrogen, oxygen and argon. These coefficients are implemented in an extended fluid model to make the fluid approximation as consistent as possible with the particle model, and to avoid discontinuities at the interface between fluid and particle regions. Then two splitting methods are introduced and compared for the location and motion of the fluid-particle-interface in three spatial dimensions. Finally, we present first results of the 3D spatially hybrid model for a negative streamer in air. Future applications of the hybrid model lie in effects of electron density fluctuations on inception, propagation and branching of streamers, and in accurate calculations of electron energies at and of electron run-away from the streamer head. The last is relevant for hard radiation from streamer-leader systems and possibly for Terrestrial Gamma-Ray Flashes. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

Though ROS can kill foreign invaders, the accumulation of these reactive molecules in animals will cause serious cell damage. Carotenoids could function as scavengers of oxygen radicals. In this research, cDNA and genomic DNA of one carotenoid isomerooxygenase gene (named EcNinaB-X1) were cloned from Exopalaemon carinicauda. EcNinaB-X1 gene was composed of 12 exons and 11 introns. EcNinaB-X1 knock-out (KO) prawns were produced via CRISPR/Cas9 technology and the change of their phenotypes were analyzed. Of the 400 injected one-cell stage embryos with cas9 mRNA and one sgRNA targeting the first exon of EcNinaB-X1 gene, 26 EcNinaB-X1-KO prawns were generated and the mutant rate reached 6.5% after embryo injection. The EcNinaB-X1-KO prawns had significant lower mortality than those in wild-type group when the prawns were challenged with Vibrio parahaemolyticus or Aeromonas hydrophila. In conclusion, we first demonstrate the function of the carotenoid isomerooxygenase gene in immune defense of E. carinicauda by performing directed, heritable gene mutagenesis.									4	1	0	0	3	0	5			1050-4648	1095-9947		WOS:000513983700044	31846777

When specific addendum atoms are present (notably, Ti, V, Nb, and Cr), these clusters dimerize in the presence of acid via the formation of mu-O linkages. These processes may be viewed as molecular models for the formation of metal-oxygen bonds in the active sites of metalloenzymes, or in materials chemistry, and we here provide detailed information concerning these reactions. For this, DFT calculations are used to provide insight into the mechanism(s) associated with dimerization of Lindqvist clusters, W5MO19n- (M=W, Mo, V, Nb, and Ti) in acidic media. In full accord with experimental data, our calculations show that dimerization of Nb and Ti derivatives is thermodynamically favored and that this is not the case for dimerization between Mo, V, and W addendum atoms. In addition, dimerization of PW11TiO405- and SiW11NbO405- to give the corresponding dimers was also calculated to be exothermic. Two possible mechanisms, involved in two competing pathways, are evaluated and discussed. Conclusions are presented concerning the role played by the nature of the metal atoms taking part in M-mu-O-M bond formation. A correlation is established between the relative strengths of specific terminal M=O bonds in monomeric precursors and the tendency of these to form M-mu-O-M bonds.									25	0	1	0	2	0	26			0020-1669	1520-510X		WOS:000239394300053	16878960

Considering the enormous size of chemical space and the expected large numbers of experiments necessary to search through it in any particular application, optimization in chemistry is surprisingly efficient. This good fortune has recently been explained by analysis of the fitness landscape, i.e., the functional relationship between a target objective J (e.g., percent yield, catalytic activity) and a suitable set of variables (e.g., resources such as reactant concentrations and processing conditions). Mathematical analysis has demonstrated that, upon satisfaction of reasonable physical assumptions, the fitness landscape contains no local sub-optimal "traps'' that preclude identification of the globally best value of J, in a development called the "OptiChem'' theorem. One of the key assumptions behind the theorem is that sufficient resources are available to achieve the posed optimization goal. This work assesses the validity of this assumption underlying the OptiChem theorem through examination of experimental data from the recent literature. In order to explore fitness landscapes in high dimensions where the landscape cannot be visualized, a high dimensional model representation (HDMR) of experimental data is used to construct a model landscape amenable to topology assessment via gradient algorithm search. This method is shown to correctly capture the trap-free topology of a four-dimensional landscape where the objective is to optimize the composition of a solid state material (subject to an elemental mole-fraction constraint) for catalytic activity towards the oxygen evolution reaction. Analysis of a six-dimensional landscape for the objective of maximizing the photoluminescence of rare-earth solid state materials subject to two elemental mole-fraction constraints and a fixed set of processing conditions reveals the presence of one landscape trap, which likely arises from the significantly constrained elemental composition of the materials and/or the fixed processing conditions.									7	0	0	0	1	0	7			1463-9076	1463-9084		WOS:000395526600011	28116365

However, this energy conversion technology is seriously hindered by the high activation barrier of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), which requires highly active and robust electrocatalysts. Herein, we have developed a novel three-dimensional (3D) core-shell OER electrocatalyst, in which defective and ultrathin NiFe layered double hydroxide (NiFe LDH) nanosheets are rationally decorated on V-doped Ni3S2 nanorod arrays supported on Ni foam (V-Ni3S2@NiFe LDH). The highly conductive V-doped Ni3S2 nanorod cores ensure rapid charge transfer, and the ultrathin NiFe LDH nanosheets with rich defects offer numerous exposed active sites, together with the unique 3D core-shell nanostructures that benefit electrolyte diffusion and gas products releasing, thus our hierarchical catalyst is distinguished by very low overpotentials of 209 and 286 mV to obtain current densities of 10 and 100 mA cm(-2), respectively, for OER in 1 M KOH. Impressively, when this 3D core-shell catalyst is paired with V-doped Ni3S2 nanorod arrays for overall water splitting, an outstanding two-electrode electrolyzer is achieved, which only requires 1.55 V to deliver a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) in 1 M KOH, even superior to the benchmark of RuO2(+)//Pt(-). Our work provides a novel and effective strategy to rationally design efficient 3D hierarchical catalysts for energy conversion and storage.									116	12	0	0	11	0	117			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000477988200040

However, coating of thin films of molybdenum nitride or carbide on a large-area self-standing substrate with high precision is still challenging. Here, MoNx is uniformly coated on carbon cloth (CC) and nitrogen-doped carbon (NC)-modified CC (NCCC) substrates by atomic layer deposition (ALD). The as-deposited film has a nanocrystalline character close to amorphous and a composition of approximately Mo2N with significant oxygen contamination, mainly at the surface. Among the as-prepared ALD-MoNx electrodes, the MoNx/NCCC has the highest HER activity (overpotential eta approximate to 236 mV to achieve 10 mA cm(-2)) owing to the high surface area and porosity of the NCCC substrate. However, the durability of the electrode is poor, owing to the poor adhesion of NC powder on CC. Annealing MoNx/NCCC in H-2 atmosphere at 400 degrees C improves both the activity and durability of the electrode without significant change in the phase or porosity. Annealing at an elevated temperature of 600 degrees C results in formation of a Mo2C phase that further enhances the activity (eta approximate to 196 mV to achieve 10 mA cm(-2)), although there is a huge reduction in the porosity of the electrode as a consequence of the annealing. The structure of the electrode is also systematically investigated by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). A deviation in the conventional Warburg impedance is observed in EIS of the NCCC-based electrode and is ascribed to the change in the H+ ion diffusion characteristics, owing to the geometry of the pores. The change in porous nature with annealing and the loss in porosity are reflected in the EIS of H+ ion diffusion observed at high-frequency. The current work establishes a better understanding of the importance of various parameters for a highly active HER electrode and will help the development of a commercial electrode for HER using the ALD technique.									10	0	0	0	1	0	10			1864-5631	1864-564X		WOS:000531330900001	32202384

In this work, we introduce a new nitrogen-doped layered oxide, Sr5Ta4O15-xNx, which exhibits a significantly extended absorption edge compared with the undoped oxide Sr5Ta4O15. The extension of the visible light absorption has been ascribed to the substitution of nitrogen for oxygen atoms as well as the formation of Ta-N bonds, which was confirmed by X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and Raman spectroscopy. Judged by the first principle calculation, the N 2p states mixed with pre-existing O 2p states shift the valence band maximum upward and result in wide visible light absorption. Band structure analysis combined with UV-Vis diffuse reflectance spectrum (DRS) and Mott-Schottky (M-S) measurement shows that the conduction and valence bands of Sr5Ta4O15-xNx are sufficient for water reduction and oxidation, respectively. The photocatalytic water splitting performances of Sr(5)Ta(4)O(15-x)Nx are strongly related to the deposited cocatalyst. With an optimized cocatalyst, the Sr5Ta4O15-xNx shows both H-2 and O-2 evolution activities under visible light irradiation using CH3OH and AgNO3 as scavengers respectively. Following the optimized cocatalyst deposition of the Sr5Ta4O15-xNx, the cocatalyst-modified nitrogen-doped tantalumbased layered oxides Sr2Ta2O7-xNx and Ba5Ta4O15-xNx also exhibit activities for both the water splitting half reactions. This work demonstrates that the nitrogen-doped tantalum-based layered oxides may be a new type of potential photocatalyst with wide visible light absorption for solar water splitting.									75	3	0	0	5	0	75			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000317584700025

Using a solvothermal reaction in tert-butanol, very small nickel oxide nanocrystals can be made with sizes tunable from 2.5 to 5 nm and a narrow particle size distribution. The crystals are perfectly dispersible in ethanol even after drying, giving stable transparent colloidal dispersions. The structure of the nanocrystals corresponds to phase-pure stoichiometric nickel(ii) oxide with a partially oxidized surface exhibiting Ni(iii) states. The 3.3 nm nanoparticles demonstrate a remarkably high turn-over frequency of 0.29 s-1 at an overpotential of g = 300 mV for electrochemical water oxidation, outperforming even expensive rare earth iridium oxide catalysts. The unique features of these NiO nanocrystals provide great potential for the preparation of novel composite materials with applications in the field of (photo)electrochemical water splitting. The dispersed colloidal solutions may also find other applications, such as the preparation of uniform hole-conducting layers for organic solar cells.									269	12	0	0	15	0	270			1616-301X	1616-3028		WOS:000337489400007

The scanning vibrating electrode technique (SVET) provides current density maps with a spatial resolution of the order of the dimensions of the sample, which allows the temporal evolution of the corrosion reactions to be followed over time. This leads to the identification and localization of cathodic and anodic sites, although the technique lacks chemical specificity for the unequivocal identification of the reactive species. The application of scanning electrochemical microscopy (SECM) was previously limited to image cathodic reaction sites, either due to oxygen consumption in the amperometric operation or by the alkalinisation of the electrolyte in potentiometric operation. However, it is shown that anodic sites can be effectively monitored using an ion-selective microelectrode (ISME) as a probe. The ISME probes detected differences in the local concentrations of Zn2+ and OH- ions from the cut edges of a complete coil coating system compared to the same system after the polymeric layers were removed. In this way, it has been shown that the inhibitor loading in the polymer layers effectively contributes to reducing the corrosion rates at the cut edge, thus helping to extend the useful life of the sacrificial galvanized layer bonded directly to the steel matrix. Additionally, these two probe configurations can be integrated into a multi-electrode tip for potentiometric operation to simultaneously monitor localized changes in pH values and metal ion dissolution in a single scan. Spatial and temporal distributions were further investigated using different rastering procedures, and the potential of constructing pseudomaps for 2D-imaging is described.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1				1420-3049		WOS:000782090200001	35408563

Especially, manipulations of molecules (molecular machines) and sophisticated organization would be attractive targets in interfacial nano architectonics. In this short review, we introduce several typical examples on manipulations of functional molecules and molecular machines at interfacial media. The examples are classified roughly according to driving forces of manipulations; (i) manipulations through chemical reactions and interactions; (ii) light-driven manipulations; (iii) electrically controlled manipulations; (iv) mechanical manipulations. Future possibilities of molecular manipulations at interfaces such as usages in biological systems are discussed in perspective section.									12	0	0	0	1	0	12			1359-0294	1879-0399		WOS:000506474700001

The degree of permeability is related to the composition of the marble. The margin of a thick pure dolomite marble chemically reacted with underlying metasyenite (a(H2O) = 0.2) to form a 2 cm boundary layer of calcite + forsterite by introduction of SiO2. No fluid penetrated past this reaction front, although the high temperature of metamorphism (approximately 800-degrees-C) allowed transport of carbon and oxygen isotopes for an additional 2 cm by diffusion through the solid dolomite. A second marble with a higher silica content underwent more decarbonation, which enhanced porosity and lead to a greater extent of isotope transport (2-3 m) in contact with quartzo-feldspathic gneiss below. An estimate of total fluid flux across the bottom of this marble layer based on the shape of the isotope profile is 1 cm3/cm2 directed down, out of the marble. At two other marble-gneiss contacts steep isotopic gradients coincide with lithologic contacts, indicating very little cross-lithology fluid flow. The extent of diffusional transport of isotopes in the marbles is limited and interpreted as indicating the transient presence of a pore fluid, generated by thermally driven devolatilization reactions. No wholesale pervasive advection of C-O-H fluid occurred across the thick, continuous, marble units near the exposed base of the Kigluaik Group section during the entire regional metamorphic cycle. Activities of pore-fluid species were controlled by internal processes. Movement of volatiles and stable-isotopes between contrasting rock-types was dominantly diffusive. Channelized fluid pathways through the marble units developed during uplift and cooling but were not present during peak metamorphism.

In this work, N-doped NiZnAl calcined layered double hydroxide on graphene (N-NiZnAl CLDH/RGO) was synthesized by ammonia treatment of the NiZnAl LDH/RGO precursor and showed good activity in CO2 reduction to CO. The faradaic efficiency of CO reached 92% at -0.83 V (vs. RHE) with a current density of 9.4 mA cm(-2). This excellent catalytic performance was mainly attributed to the N doping and the synergistic effect of Ni and Zn.									11	3	0	0	2	0	11			2398-4902			WOS:000469258600008

Hydrazine hydrate serves as a reducing agent to prevent the rapid aggregation of Fe nanocatalysts, which facilitates the growth of CNTs during pyrolysis. And it is discovered for the first time that sulfate ions can be used as a sulfur source to create C-S-C bonds by reaction with carbon at a high temperature. The prepared Fe/N/S-CNTs exhibits excellent ORR activity with a half-wave potential of 0.887 V in alkaline medium, which is 42 mV higher than that of commercial Pt/C (0.845 V), and its half-wave potential is just 26 mV lower than that of Pt/C in acidic medium. In addition, it also has high stability and methanol resistance ability in both alkaline and acidic electrolytes. Furthermore, when used as the cathode in primary Zn-air batteries, the power density of Fe/N/S-CNTs reaches 111 mW cm(-2), which is 1.5 times higher than that of Pt/C (73 mW cm(-2)). Experimental results and DFT calculations demonstrate that the high-yield of CNTs, the optimal balance ratio of pyridinic and graphitic N, and the synergistic effect of C-S-C and Fe-N-x are all essential ingredients for the outstanding ORR performance.									100	6	0	0	2	0	101			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000448412700022

Electrochemical conversion processes, such as water splitting, CO2 conversion and N-2 electroreduction, have been considered as successful approaches to solve these energy issues. Over the past decade, combining of theory and experiment has proven to be an innovative strategy, providing a framework for the design of high-performance catalysts and to investigate their mechanisms. This review introduces recent progress in theoretical strategies for state-of-the-art heterogeneous electrocatalysts. Theoretical approaches are essential for grasping the intrinsic nature of the catalytic materials. Various levels of model system, with corresponding descriptions to capture the realistic environment, are addressed. Meanwhile, machine learning using data obtained by high-throughput screening, exploited as a new scientific approach, is discussed. Based on this review, it is expected that theoretical approaches will shed light on the future design of electrocatalysts, allowing for the development of sustainable energy sources.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			1738-8228			WOS:000454937800001

CoPi surface modification is known to cathodically shift the water oxidation onset potential; however, the reason for this improvement has not until now been fully understood. The transient absorption and photocurrent data were analyzed using a simple kinetic model, which allows quantification of the competition between electron/hole recombination and water oxidation. The results of this model are shown to be in excellent agreement with the measured photocurrent data. We demonstrate that the origin of the improvement of photocurrent onset resulting from CoPi treatment is primarily due to retardation of back electron/hole recombination across the space charge layer; no evidence of catalytic water oxidation via CoPi was observed.									100	0	0	0	4	0	100			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000363145500028	27358733

Therefore, the development of electrocatalytic conversion technologies that can convert renewable resources, such as water and nitrogen, into value-added chemicals or fuels (e.g., hydrogen and ammonia) can be crucial. A number of transition metal carbides (TMCs) have been investigated over the past few years as effective electrocatalysts for various reactions. This is mainly owing to their unique electronic structures, which leads to high electrical conductivity and chemical stability. Moreover, the reactivity of TMC-based electrocatalysts is highly dependent on their surface and interfacial properties. This review focuses on tuning nanostructures and interfaces to enhance the electrocatalytic activity of TMC-based materials for hydrogen production and nitrogen fixation. The mechanisms behind the surface and interface engineering are discussed, including the synergy effects, facet binding energy, active defects, and low-coordinated sites. In particular, studies on activity enhancement through design of the interfacial phase, composition, and structure in TMC-based electrocatalysts are highlighted. The effective tuning strategies might pave the way for future development of highly active TMC-based electrocatalysts for sustainable energy-related conversion.									42	4	0	0	1	0	42			2051-6347	2051-6355		WOS:000518381300003

The focus is on the preparation of model supported catalysts in which the number of atoms in the deposited clusters is precisely controlled using a combination of gas-phase cluster ion sources, mass spectrometry, and soft-landing techniques. This approach is particularly effective for investigations of small nanoclusters, 0.5-2 nm (<200 atoms), where the rapid evolution of the atomic and electronic structure makes it essential to have precise control over cluster size. Cluster deposition allows for independent control of cluster size, coverage, and stoichiometry (e.g., the metal-to-oxygen ratio in an oxide cluster) and can be used to deposit on any substrate without constraints of nucleation and growth. Examples are presented for metal, metal oxide, and metal sulfide cluster deposition on a variety of supports (metals, oxides, carbon/diamond) where the reactivity, cluster support electronic interactions, and cluster stability and morphology are investigated. Both UHV and in situ/operando studies are presented that also make use of surface-sensitive X-ray characterization tools from synchrotron radiation facilities. Novel applications of cluster deposition to electrochemistry and batteries are also presented. This review also highlights the application of modern ab initio electronic structure calculations (density functional theory), which can essentially model the exact experimental system used in the laboratory (i.e., cluster and support) to provide insight on atomic and electronic structure, reaction energetics, and mechanisms. As amply demonstrated in this review, the powerful combination of atomically precise cluster deposition and theory is able to address fundamental aspects of size-effects, cluster support interactions, and reaction mechanisms of cluster materials that are central to how catalysts function. The insight gained from such studies can be used to further the development of novel nanostructured catalysts with high activity and selectivity.									198	11	0	0	9	0	201			2155-5435			WOS:000366153300014

The physico-chemical properties of the material were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and transmission electron microscopy (TEM), ultravioletevisible (UV-Vis) diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS) photoluminescence spectra (PL) and Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface area test. The morphology analysis indicated that Ag3PO4 particles were heterogeneously dispersed on the surface of layered g-C3N4. The Ag3PO4/g-C3N4 nanocomposites were applied in the photodegradation of bisphenol A under the visible light irradiation. The effects of the material proportion, the initial concentration of BPA, and the salinity on the degradation were discussed. The results showed that 92.8% bisphenol A (10mg/L) can be photodegraded under 3 h irradiation by Ag3PO4/g-C3N4 with 25% Ag3PO4 mass ratio. The photodegradation kinetics and possible photocatalytic mechanism were discussed. The active specie center dot O-(2) over bar was found to play a key role during the photocatalytic reaction. The reaction mechanism was described based on valence band, conduction band energy levels and reduction potentials of oxygen and hydroxyl radicals. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

J	Wang, Qian; Vaupel, Peter; Ziegler, Sibylle I.; Shi, Kuangyu					Shi, Kuangyu/0000-0002-8714-3084			Exploring the quantitative relationship between metabolism and enzymatic phenotype by physiological modeling of glucose metabolism and lactate oxidation in solid tumors								PHYSICS IN MEDICINE AND BIOLOGY				60	6			2547	2571		10.1088/0031-9155/60/6/2547				MAR 21 2015	2015	Molecular imaging using PET or hyperpolarized MRI can characterize tumor phenotypes by assessing the related metabolism of certain substrates. However, the interpretation of the substrate turnover in terms of a pathophysiological understanding is not straightforward and only semiquantitative. The metabolism of imaging probes is influenced by a number of factors, such as the microvascular structure or the expression of key enzymes. This study aims to use computational simulation to investigate the relationship between the metabolism behind molecular imaging and the underlying tumor phenotype. The study focused on the pathways of glucose metabolism and lactate oxidation in order to establish the quantitative relationship between the expression of several transporters (GLUT, MCT1 and MCT4), expression of the enzyme hexokinase (HK), microvasculature and the metabolism of glucose or lactate and the extracellular pH distribution. A computational model for a 2D tumor tissue phantom was constructed and the spatio-temporal evolution of related species (e.g. oxygen, glucose, lactate, protons, bicarbonate ions) was estimated by solving reaction-diffusion equations. The proposed model was tested by the verification of the simulation results using in vivo and in vitro literature data. The influences of different expression levels of GLUT, MCT1, MCT4, HK and microvessel distribution on substrate concentrations were analyzed. The major results are consistent with experimental data (e.g. GLUT is more influential to glycolytic flux than HK; extracellular pH is not correlated with MCT expressions) and provide theoretical interpretation of the co-influence of multiple factors of the tumor microenvironment. This computational simulation may assist the generation of hypotheses to bridge the discrepancy between tumor metabolism and the functions of transporters and enzymes. It has the potential to accelerate the development of multimodal imaging strategies for assessment of tumor phenotypes.									12	0	0	0	10	0	12			0031-9155	1361-6560		WOS:000354880900018	25761504

Its potential has been demonstrated through the synthesis of metallic nanoparticles with various sizes and shapes. However, although one of the roles of polyol is to act as a reducing agent, research studies related to the investigation of the redox reaction mechanism have been scarce. In this study, we report the results of a detailed study undertaken to investigate the polyol oxidation and metal reduction for the cobalt(II)-ethylene glycol system with the possible addition of a base (Na) to the system using several physico-chemical techniques such as NMR, FT-IR, ESI-TOFMS and XRD. The results suggested that in the reduction reaction, ethylene glycol first reacts with the base to produce the ethylene glycol monoanion, hereinafter denoted as EG(-). This reaction not only occurs between ethylene glycol and the base, but also occurs with Co2+ species. In such a case, the formation of Co alkoxide and the subsequent reduction could progress even in the presence of a weak base such as acetate ion or any other solvent that has a lone pair of electrons such as oxygen in ether. On the other hand, in the case of oxidation of ethylene glycol, first the base attacks one of the two a-protons in Co alkoxide and along with the electron transfer to Co2+, ethylene glycol gets oxidized to aldehyde. Then, the aldehyde thus formed undergoes bond exchange with the neighboring coordinated ethylene glycol and an ester is formed. The above steps are repeated and the hydrogen atoms coordinated with Co get detached with the evolution of hydrogen gas, while ethylene glycol is oxidized to polyglycolic acid. The analytical techniques and the results obtained in this study could be used to enhance the properties of metals and alloy nanoparticles synthesized using the polyol process.									23	0	0	0	1	0	23			1144-0546	1369-9261		WOS:000384754300056

However, only several classes of oxygenolytic fission reaction have been identified for the critical ring cleavage dioxygenases. Among them, the most well studied dioxygenases proceed via catecholic intermediates, followed by noncatecholic hydroxy-substituted aromatic carboxylic acids. Therefore, the recently reported hydroquinone 1,2-dioxygenases add to the diversity of ring cleavage reactions. Two-subunit hydroquinone 1,2-dioxygenase PnpCD, the key enzyme in the hydroquinone pathway ofpara-nitrophenol degradation, catalyzes the ring cleavage of hydroquinone to y-hydroxymuconic semialdehyde. Here, we report three PnpCll structures, named apo-PnpCD, PnpCD-Fe3+, and PnpCDCd(2+)-HBN (substrate analog hydroxyenzonitrile), respectively. Structural analysis showed that both the PnpC and the (-terminal domains of Pnpll comprise a conserved cupin fold, whereas PnpC cannot form a competent metal binding pocket as can Pnpll cupin. Four residues of PnpD (His-256, Asn-258, Glu-262, and His-303) were observed to coordinate the iron ion. The Asn258 coordination is particularly interesting because this coordinating residue has never been observed in the homologous cupin structures of PnpCD. Asn-258 is proposed to play a pivotal role in binding the iron prior to the enzymatic reaction, but it might lose coordination to the iron when the reaction begins. Pnpll also consists of an intriguing N-terminal domain that might have functions other than nucleic acid binding in its structural homologs. In summary, PnpCll has no apparent evolutionary relationship with other iron-dependent dioxygenases and therefore defines a new structural class. The study of PnpCD might add to the understanding of the ring cleavage of dioxygenases.									11	0	0	0	9	0	11			0021-9258	1083-351X		WOS:000362218900039	26304122

The products of this oxidation are dioxygen, which is released to the atmosphere, and reducing equivalents destined to reduce carbon dioxide to organic molecules. The water oxidation occurs at catalytic sites composed of four manganese atoms (Mn-4-cluster) and powered by the redox potential of an oxidised chlorophyll a molecule (P680(.-)). Gerald T (Jerry) Babcock and colleagues showed that electron/proton transfer processes from substrate water to P680(.-) involved a tyrosine residue (Y-Z) and proposed an attractive reaction mechanism for the direct involvement of Y-Z in the chemistry of water oxidation. The 'hydrogen-atom abstract/metalloradical' mechanism he formulated is an expression of his genius and a highlight of his many other outstanding contributions to photosynthesis research. A structural basis for Jerry's model is now being revealed by X-ray crystallography. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V.

In such an association, cellular and molecular mechanisms have evolved to maintain oyster homeostasis upon stressful conditions including infection and changing environments. We give here cellular and molecular insights into the Crassostrea gigas antimicrobial defense system with focus on antimicrobial peptides and proteins (AMPS). This review highlights the central role of the hemocytes in the modulation and control of oyster antimicrobial response. As vehicles for AMPs and other antimicrobial effectors, including reactive oxygen species (ROS), and together with epithelia, hemocytes provide the oyster with local defense reactions instead of systemic humoral ones. These reactions are largely based on phagocytosis but also, as recently described, on the extracellular release of antimicrobial histones (ETosis) which is triggered by ROS. Thus, ROS can signal danger and activate cellular responses in the oyster. From the current literature, AMP production/release could serve similar functions. We provide also new lights on the oyster genetic background that underlies a great diversity of AMP sequences but also an extraordinary individual polymorphism of AMP gene expression. We discuss here how this polymorphism could generate new immune functions, new pathogen resistances or support individual adaptation to environmental stresses. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

However, the understanding of their clear relationship between structure and activity is difficult and insufficient.

Electrochemical characterization indicates a Nernstian dependence on the added proton source for the reduction of Mn(III) to Mn(II). The resultant species is competent for the reduction of dioxygen to H2O2 with 81 +/- 4% Faradaic efficiency. Mechanistic studies suggest that the catalytically active species has been generated through the interaction of the added proton donor and the parent Mn complex, resulting in the protonation of a coordinated phenolate moiety following the single-electron reduction, generating a neutral species with a vacant coordination site at the metal center. As a consequence, the active catalyst has a pendent proton source in close proximity to the active site for subsequent intramolecular reactions.									35	1	0	0	5	0	35			0002-7863	1520-5126		WOS:000427203600015	29216711

However, recent experiments show a clear difference between the practical and summed damages, indicating significant irradiation synergistic effects (ISEs). Understanding the behaviors and mechanisms of ISEs is essential to predict the practical damages. In this work, we first make a brief review on the state of the art, critically emphasizing the difficulty encountered in previous models to understand the dose-rate dependence of the ISEs. We then introduce in detail our models explaining this basic phenomenon, which can be described as follows. Firstly, we show our experimental works on PNP and NPN transistors. A variable neutron fluence and y-ray dose setup is adopted. Fluence-dependent "tick"-like and sublinear dose profiles are observed for PNP and NPN transistors, respectively. Secondly, we describe our theoretical investigations on the positive ISE in NPN transistors. We propose an atomistic model of transformation and annihilation of displacement-irradiation-induced V-2 defects in p-ype silicon under ionization irradiation, which is totally different from the traditional picture of a Coulomb interaction of oxide trapped charges in silica on charge carriers in irradiated silicon. The predicted novel dose and fluence dependences are fully verified by the experimental data. Thirdly, the mechanism of the observed negative ISE in PNP transistors is investigated in a similar way as in the NPN transistor case. The difference is that in n-type silicon, displacement-irradiation-induced VO defects also undergo an ionization-induced transformation and annihilation process. Our results show that the evolution of displacement defects due to carrier-enhanced defect diffusion and reaction is the dominating mechanism of the ISEs. Finally, we give a perspective on future investigations on the ISEs when the displacement and ionization irradiations are present simultaneously.									5	1	0	0	0	0	5				2637-6113		WOS:000603295000001

Here, we document microtextures comprising intergrowth of bastna spacing diaeresis site, hydroxyl-parisite, ro spacing diaeresis ntgenite, synchysite, and pyrochlore, with calcite that pseudomorphically replaces patches of hematite with cellular boxwork-type structure, in calciocarbonatites from the Kamthai alkaline complex in western India. The nature of the REE mineralization grades from proximal bastna spacing diaeresis site-dominated to distal hydroxyl-parisite dominated in the boxworks. The microtextural relations and trace element chemistry of hematite, magnetite and calcite, and C-O isotope composition of carbonate are suggestive of extensive low-temperature hydrothermal alteration of the carbonatites. The hematite boxwork structure and the REE mineral-calcite intergrowths often have squarish outlines and are interpreted to have pseudomorphed primary magnetite during fluid-rock interaction. We propose a new mechanism of REE precipitation in magnetite-rich carbonatites involving influx of acidic hydrothermal fluids, which scavenged the REE and other trace elements from magmatic carbonates and apatite. These acidic fluids were responsible for the protonation of magnetite and leaching out of Fe2+, converting them to hematite through a non-redox transformation. The reaction results in 32% volume reduction for every mole of magnetite consumed, generating significant rock porosity, which further aided and abetted fluid-rock reaction and hydrothermal alteration. More importantly, it consumed proton, which increased the fluid pH triggering precipitation of bastnasite-group minerals (including bastnasite, parasite, ro spacing diaeresis ntgenite, synchysite). Close to the magnetite-hematite reaction front, fluor-dominated bastnasite-group minerals (mainly bastnasite) appear, while away from such fronts, mineralization was enriched in hydroxyl-bastnasite group minerals (mainly parisite) as a consequence of decreasing activity of F- and/or increasing activity of OH- with the progress of magnetite-to-hematite transformation.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0024-4937	1872-6143		WOS:000697456700003

Nevertheless, the electrochemical energy storage performance of MOF derivatives can still be further enhanced through building composites with other functional materials. It is of great significance in developing new strategies of fabricating MOF composites to achieve electrode materials with improved charge transfer and electrochemical redox reaction kinetics. In this review, the novel design and strategies of MOF composites with various functional components are focused on, including carbon-based materials (carbon nanotubes, graphene, etc.), metal oxides, 3D conductive substrates, polymeric materials, and the second MOFs and metal salts, especially their derivatives for energy storage and conversion fields. The key factors for controllable synthesis of various MOF composites and electrochemical performance enhancement mechanisms are discussed in detail. It is expected that this review will provide new inspiration for the development of MOF derivatives for energy storage and conversion.									31	5	0	0	0	0	32			2366-9608			WOS:000507978800001

The recent application of high throughput experimentation to interface discovery for solar fuels photoanodes has revealed several surprising and promising mixed-metal oxide coatings for BiVO4. Using sputter deposition of composition and thickness gradients on a uniform BiVO4 film, we systematically explore photoanodic performance as a function of the composition and loading of Fe-Ce oxide coatings. This combinatorial materials integration study not only enhances the performance of this new class of materials but also identifies CeO2 as a critical ingredient that merits detailed study. A heteroepitaxial CeO2(001)/BiVO4(010) interface is identified in which Bi and V remain fully coordinated to O such that no surface states are formed. Ab initio calculations of the integrated materials and inspection of the electronic structure reveals mechanisms by which CeO2 facilitates charge transport while mitigating deleterious recombination. The results support the observations that addition of Ce to BiVO4 coatings greatly enhances photoelectrocatalytic activity, providing an important strategy for developing a scalable solar fuels technology.									16	0	0	0	3	0	16			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000384444200033

Bimetallic nanocrystals are expected to exhibit improved physical and chemical properties due to the synergistic effect between the two metals, not just a combination of two monometallic properties. More importantly, the properties of bimetallic nanocrystals are significantly affected by their morphology, structure, and atomic arrangement. Reasonable regulation of these parameters of nanocrystals can effectively control their properties and enhance their practicality in a given application. This review summarizes some recent research progress in the controlled synthesis of shape, composition and structure, as well as some important applications of bimetallic nanocrystals. We first give a brief introduction to the development of bimetals, followed by the architectural diversity of bimetallic nanocrystals. The most commonly used and typical synthesis methods are also summarized, and the possible morphologies under different conditions are also discussed. Finally, we discuss the composition-dependent and shape-dependent properties of bimetals in terms of highlighting applications such as catalysis, energy conversion, gas sensing and bio-detection applications.									13	0	0	0	0	0	13				2079-4991		WOS:000690014100001	34443756

However, it is severely impeded by the chlorine ions in seawater, which can cause corrosion and an undesirable competing reaction at the anode. So it is highly desirable to exploit a highly active, chlorine corrosion resistant and selective OER electrode for seawater splitting. Here, a heterogeneous NiFe-sulfide electrode is proposed to achieve an efficient OER process in alkaline seawater. Considering the 2D lamellar architecture with a rough surface and a considerable amount of micro voids, the dual electronic configuration of sulfur and iron, the strong synergistic effect between Ni and Fe at the atomic level and the interfacial engineering between the NiS/Ni3S2 phase and FeS phase at the nanoscale level, the Ni6Fe2S-0.05 M electrode exhibits predominant catalytic activity with an overpotential of 353 mV to reach 200 mA cm(-2), superior long-term stability with 50 h accelerated stability test and higher selectivity toward the OER.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0				2046-2069		WOS:000864816900001	36320543

Under illumination of microwaves (radar), electrons inside the laser-induced plasma oscillate with the electric field of the microwave and re-radiate from the electrons forming coherent scattering. In the far-field approximation, the microwave scattering from the small volume plasma reflects the generation and evolution of unbounded electrons inside the plasma, when the microwave wavelength is much greater than the size of the plasma and the skin layer depth at the microwave frequency is larger than the size of the plasma. Laser excitation schemes, microwave detection methods, calibration of microwave scattering, and the novel applications of the technique have been significantly expanded and improved. This review paper summarizes physical principles, various REMPI excitation schemes for atomic and molecular species, and temperature measurements in plasma and reactive flows. Discussions on new research directions and applications are given at the end.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			0963-0252	1361-6595		WOS:000704449700001

The first group, presented by the reductive aromas, is caused mainly by excessive H2S and other volatile sulfur compounds with a negative impact on wine quality. The most efficient prevention of undesirable reductive aromas in wine lies in creating optimal conditions for yeast and controlling the chemistry of sulfur compounds, and the pros and cons of correction methods are discussed. The second is browning which is associated especially with the enzymatic and non-enzymatic reaction of polyphenols and the prevention of this fault is connected with decreasing the polyphenol content in must, lowering oxygen access during handling, the use of antioxidants, and correction stands for the use of fining agents. The third fault, atypical aging, mostly occurs in the agrotechnics of the entire green land cover in the vineyard and the associated stress from lack of nutrients and moisture. Typical fox tones, naphthalene, or wet towel off-odors, especially in white wines are possible to prevent by proper moisture and grassland cover and alternating greenery combined with harmonious nutrition, while the correction is possible only partially with an application of fresh yeast. With the current knowledge, the mistakes in wines of non-microbial origin can be reliably prevented. Prevention is essential because corrective solutions for the faults are difficult and never perfect.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0				1420-3049		WOS:000808745500001	35684472

In this work, a nitrogen-modulated NiMoO4 growth on Ni foam (N-NiMoO4/NF) is prepared via the treatment of NiMoO4 in 1% NH3 at 500 degrees C. Compared with NiMoO4, the nitrogen-modulated NiMoO4 promotes electro-oxidation of HMF to FDCA and exhibits almost 100% HMF conversion, 97% FDCA yield, and 91% faradaic efficiency. N-NiMoO4 has a higher electrochemical surface area and lower charge transfer resistance than NiMoO4, which enhances the activity of the catalyst for electrocatalytic oxidation of HMF to FDCA.

Among many techniques, quantum chemical topology (QCT) has emerged as a robust technique to understand the features of the chemical bond and electron organization within molecules. One consolidate tool within QCT is the topological analysis of the electron localization function (ELF). Most research on ELF and chemical bond has focused either on singlet ground states or the first excited triplet. However, most photochemical reactions and photophysical processes occur in excited states with the same spin-symmetry as the ground state. In this work, we develop a proposal on how to compute the ELF in excited states of any symmetry within linear-response time-dependent density functional theory. Then, we study the evolution of the chemical bonds in the ground- and excited-state intramolecular proton transfer (ESIPT) of a prototypal Schiff base (the salicylidene methylamine). We found that the topological analysis of the ELF along reaction paths explains the presence of a barrier for the proton transfer in the ground state and the absence of it in the excited state. Briefly, in the ground state, the cleavage of the O-H bond results in a structure with high electrostatic potential energy due to an excess of electron lone-pairs (3) in the oxygen atom, which explains the barrier. In the excited state, the electronic transition promotes an enhancement of the basicity of nitrogen by allocating three nonbonding electrons in the basin of its lone-pair. This excess of electrons in the N exerts an electrostatic attraction of the proton, which we suggest as the primary driven-force of the barrierless reaction. Because in excited states the molecule can develop more vibrational kinetic energy than in the ground state, we performed an ab initio molecular dynamics of the proton transfer in the excited state and corroborate that our conclusions on the topology of the ELF do not change due to dynamic effects.									9	0	0	0	1	0	9			1549-9618	1549-9626		WOS:000489678700032	31461279

Geothermobarometry, stable isotope data and fluid inclusion studies revealed discrepancies between peak metamorphic conditions on the one hand and observed fluid compositions and densities of the primary fluid on the other hand. Oxygen isotope thermometry on several mineral pairs yielded concordant peak metamorphic temperatures in the range of 560 to 590 degreesC. Combination of these temperature estimates with the analysis of phase relations suggests peak pressures between 5.5 and 7.5 kilobars and the presence of a mixed-volatile pore fluid with a water content of X-H2O between 0.4 and 0.5 and with a molar volume of about 31 cm(3)/mol. The garnet- and kyanite-hosted primary fluid inclusions belong to the CO2-N-2, and CO-H2O systems, respectively. The generally low X-H2O (< 0.26) of the fluid and the high fluid molar volumes of 45 to 74 cm(3)/mol are inconsistent with the estimated peak metamorphic conditions indicating post-entrapment modifications of the primary fluid inclusions. We suggest that two mechanisms. the loss of H2O due to pressure or fugacity gradients from the inclusions to the pore fluid and the selective removal of H2O in the course of chemical reaction between the inclusion fluid and the respective host mineral were responsible for these modifications. The latter mechanism is corroborated by the presence of chlorite aggregates within the primary inclusions, which are interpreted as the products of retrograde hydration reactions between a water-bearing inclusion fluid and the garnet host. Theoretical considerations are presented which confirm that a combination of both reequilibration mechanisms can fully explain the discrepancies between the inferred peak metamorphic conditions and the observed fluid compositions and densities.									3	0	0	0	1	0	3			0036-7699			WOS:000179742300003

Sodium aluminum hydride has long been studied as an archetype for higher-capacity metal hydrides, with improved reversibility demonstrated through the addition of titanium catalysts; however, atomistic mechanisms for surface processes, including hydrogen desorption, are still uncertain. Here, operando and ex situ measurements from a suite of diagnostic tools probing multiple length scales are combined with ab initio simulations to provide a detailed and unbiased view of the evolution of the surface chemistry during hydrogen release. In contrast to some previously proposed mechanisms, the titanium dopant does not directly facilitate desorption at the surface. Instead, oxidized surface species, even on well-protected NaAlH4 samples, evolve during dehydrogenation to form surface hydroxides with differing levels of hydrogen saturation. Additionally, the presence of these oxidized species leads to considerably lower computed barriers for H-2 formation compared to pristine hydride surfaces, suggesting that oxygen may actively participate in hydrogen release, rather than merely inhibiting diffusion as is commonly presumed. These results demonstrate how close experiment-theory feedback can elucidate mechanistic understanding of complex metal hydride chemistry and potentially impactful roles of unavoidable surface impurities.									14	1	0	0	0	0	14			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000458347900025	30630309

Obtained results concerning synthesis and physicochemical properties can contribute substantially to a fundamental understanding of the relationship between coating structure and catalytic activity, important to all fields of catalysis.RESULTS The introduction of C4F9SO3K into the PbO2 deposition electrolyte leads to insignificant inhibition of the Pb2+ electro-oxidation process, whereas the mechanism of the process does not change. Upon deposition of coatings from electrolytes containing surfactants, a composite coating is formed. Depending on the electrolyte composition and electrolysis conditions, the surfactant content in the composite can vary from 2.00 +/- 0.05 to 17.00 +/- 0.05 wt%. The inclusion of surfactants in the coating composition with subsequent overgrowth with PbO2 leads to a decrease in the size of PbO2 crystals and prevents the formation of polycrystalline blocks. The composite material is a PbO2 matrix with submicron and nanoscale crystals into which surfactant particles are embedded.CONCLUSION It was shown that the electrocatalytic activity of composite PbO2-surfactant materials depends on the nature and content of the latter in the composite. The use of PbO2 doped with C4F9SO3K as an anode leads to an inhibition of the process of oxygen evolution and an almost three-fold increase in the rate of electrochemical conversion of 4-chlorophenol to aliphatic compounds.

This simple method avoids treatment at high temperature, utility of surfactants or templates, and can be finished within a short time. The results indicate that oxygen-vacancies were formed in La(OH)(3) nanorods, which could extend the photoresponse range. The XPS, PL, solid state ESR measurements and DFT calculations revealed the pivotal role of oxygen-vacancy in the formation of an impurity level in the band gap of La(OH)(3). The as-prepared La(OH)(3) nanorods exhibited efficient photocatalytic activity in the removal of NO at the ppb-level under ultraviolet illumination. The highly enhanced photocatalytic activity of La(OH)(3) nanorods could be ascribed to the synergy of the lower impurity level below the conduction band and the high separation efficiency of photogenerated electron-hole pairs. DMPO-ESR spin trapping results imply that the hydroxyl radicals are the main reactive species that are responsible for NO photooxidation. On the basis of combined experimental and theoretical investigation, an oxygen vacancy-mediated photocatalysis mechanism of defective La(OH)(3) nanorods was proposed. This work could not only provide a fast and environmentally friendly approach for the synthesis of nanostructured photocatalysts, but also new insights into the understanding of the role of vacancy in semiconductor photocatalysis.									67	5	0	0	7	0	69			1463-9076	1463-9084		WOS:000356056000066	26028430

The MoOx surface density on ZrO2 was varied over a wide range (0.35-50 Mo/nm(2)) by changing the Mo content (1-44 wt % MoO3) and the treatment temperature (393-973 K). Raman spectra showed that MoOx/ZrO2 samples with low surface density (<5 Mo/nm(2)) treated at temperatures below 873 K initially contain isolated tetrahedral MoOx species; these species oligomerize to form two-dimensional structures with bridging Mo-O-Mo bonds as the surface density increased to values typical for a polymolybdate monolayer (<similar to>5 Mo/nm(2)). An increase in surface density led to a shift in the nu>(*) over bar * (Mo=O) Raman band to higher frequencies and to changes in the near-edge X-ray absorption spectra. Both of these are consistent with the growth of these polymolybdate domains with increasing Mo surface density, as also suggested by the concurrent decrease in the UV-visible absorption energy. Thermal treatment at 973 K led to the dissociation of Mo-O-Mo bonds and to the formation of tetragonal-pyramidal O=MoO4 species. For MoOx/ZrO2 samples with Mo surface densities greater than 5 Mo/nm(2), MoO3 and Zr(MoO4)(2) were detected by Raman and for larger crystallites also by X-ray diffraction. Treatment of these samples in air at 723 K led to the predominant formation of MoO3, while higher temperatures led to a solid-state reaction between MoO3 and ZrO2 to form Zr(MoO4)(2) This structural evolution was confirmed by the evolution of pre-edge and near edge features in the X-ray absorption spectra of these high surface density samples. Zr(MoO4)(2) contains Mo6+ cations in a distorted tetrahedral coordination with one oxygen bonded only to molybdenum and the other three shared by Zr and Mo atoms. The Raman bands observed for Zr(MoO4)(2) at 750, 945, and 1003 cm(-1) were assigned to nu (sym)(O-Mo-O), nu (asym)(O-Mo-O), and nu>(*) over bar * (Mo=O) vibrational modes, respectively, based on the analysis of the Raman bands observed after O-18(2) exchange with lattice oxygen atoms. Bridging O atoms in Mo-O-Mo species exchanged with gas phase O-18(2) more readily than terminal Mo=O species.									105	3	1	0	3	0	106			1089-5647			WOS:000165197900018

PCC 6803 heme oxygenase gene, ho-1 , has been constructed, using a synthetic gene. A soluble protein was expressed at high levels and was highly purified, for the first time. The protein binds equimolar free hemin to catabolize the bound hemin to ferric-biliverdin IXalpha in the presence of oxygen and reducing equivalents, showing the heme oxygenase activity. During the reaction, verdoheme intermediate is formed with the evolution of carbon monoxide. Though both ascorbate and NADPH-cytochrome P450 reductase serve as an electron donor, the heme catabolism assisted by ascorbate is considerably slow and the reaction with NADPH-cytochrome P450 reductase is greatly retarded after the oxy-heme complex formation. The optical absorption spectra of the heme-enzyme complexes are similar to those of the known heme oxygenase complexes but have some distinct features, exhibiting the Soret band slightly blue-shifted and relatively strong CT bands of the high-spin component in the ferric form spectrum. The heme-enzyme complex shows the acid-base transition, where two alkaline species are generated. EPR of the nitrosyl heme complex has established the nitrogenous proximal ligand, presumably histidine 17 and the obtained EPR parameters are discriminated from those of the rat heme oxygenase-1 complex. The spectroscopic characters as well as the catabolic activities strongly suggest that, in spite of very high conservation of the primary structure, the heme pocket structure of Synechocystis heme oxygenase isoform-1 is different from that of rat heme oxygenase isoform-1, rather resembling that of bacterial heme oxygenase, Hmu O.									38	4	0	0	36	0	42			0014-2956			WOS:000180844900013	12581208

Whole-rock samples from drill cores of Vilarelho da Raia granite have delta O-18 values in the +11.47 to +10.10 parts per thousand range. The lower values correspond to highly fractured granite samples displaying vein and pervasive alteration. In the pervasive alteration stage, which probably results from a convective hydrothermal system set up by the intrusion of the granites, the metamorphic waters are in equilibrium with hydrous minerals. In contrast, the vein alteration of these granitic rocks was caused by water of meteoric origin. The oxygen ratios between water (W) and rock (R), the so-called W/R ratios, obtained for the open system (where the heated water is lost from the system by escape to the surface) range between 0.05 and 0.11, suggesting that the recrystallization of the veins was influenced by a small flux of meteoric water. Stable isotope analyses performed on the cores show that the vein alteration stage relates to post-emplacement tectonic stresses acting on the granite, probably of late Hercynian age. Our results are consistent with the existence of two separate alteration events (pervasive and vein) caused by hydrothermal waters of different isotopic characteristics. The studies presented in this paper should be viewed as a natural analogue that uses the alteration features observed in a "fossil" geothermal system at Vilarelho da Raia to assess possible water-rock reactions presently occurring at depth in granitic rocks of the nearby Chaves area.

Functional in vivo incorporation of Sr2+ into the oxygen-evolving complex (OEC) was confirmed by EPR analysis of the isolated and highly purified SrPSII complex in agreement with the previous study of Boussac et at. [J. Biol. Chem. 279 (2004) 22809-22819]. Three-dimensional crystals of SrPSII complex were obtained which diffracted to 3.9 A and belonged to the orthorhombic space group P2(1)2(1)2(1) with unit cell dimensions of a= 133.6 angstrom, b=236.6 angstrom, c=307.8 angstrom. Anomalous diffraction data collected at the Sr K-X-ray absorption edge identified a novel Sr2+-binding site which, within the resolution of these data (6.5 angstrom), is consistent with the positioning of Ca2+ in the recent crystallographic models of PSII [Ferreira et al. Science 303 (2004) 1831-1838, Loll et al. Nature 438 (2005) 1040-1044]. Fluorescence measurements on SrPSII crystals confirmed that crystallized SrPSII was active in transferring electrons from the OEC to the acceptor site of the reaction centre. However, SrPSII showed altered functional properties of its modified OEC in comparison with that of the CaPSII counterpart: slowdown of the Q(A)-to-Q(B) electron transfer and stabilized S(2)Q(A)(-) charge recombination.

J	Li, Shanshan; Hu, Chun; Peng, Yannan; Chen, Zhihong								One-step scalable synthesis of honeycomb-like g-C3N4 with broad sub-bandgap absorption for superior visible-light-driven photocatalytic hydrogen evolution								RSC ADVANCES				9	56			32674	32682		10.1039/c9ra07068k				OCT 14 2019	2019	Integration of a nanostructure design with a sub-bandgap has shown great promise in enhancing the photocatalytic H-2 production activity of g-C(3)N(4)via facilitating the separation of photogenerated charges while simultaneously increasing the active sites and light harvesting ability. However, the development of a synthetic route to generate an ordered g-C3N4 structure with remarkable sub-bandgap absorption via a scalable and economic approach is challenging. Herein, we report the preparation of a honeycomb-like structured g-C3N4 with broad oxygen sub-bandgap absorption (denoted as HOCN) via a scalable one-pot copolymerization process using oxamide as the modelling agent and oxygen doping source. The morphology and sub-bandgap position can be tailored by controlling the oxamide to dicyandiamide ratio. All HOCN samples exhibit remarkable enhancement of photocatalytic H-2 production activity due to the synergistic effect between the sub-bandgap and honeycomb structure, which results in strong light absorption extending up to 1000 nm, fast separation of photogenerated charge carriers, and rich photocatalytic reaction sites. In particular, HOCN4 exhibits a remarkable photocatalytic H-2 production rate of 1140 mu mol h(-1) g(-1) under visible light irradiation (>420 nm), which is more than 13.9 times faster than the production rate of pristine g-C3N4. Moreover, even under longer wavelength light irradiation (i.e., >500 and >800 nm), HOCN4 still exhibits a high H-2 production rate of 477 and 91 mu mol h(-1) g(-1), respectively. In addition, HOCN4 possesses an apparent quantum yield (AQY) of 4.32% at 420 nm and 0.12% at 800 nm. These results confirm that the proposed synthesis strategy allow for scalable production of g-C3N4 with an ordered nanostructure via electronic modulation, which is beneficial for its practical application in photocatalytic H-2 production.									11	2	0	0	3	0	12				2046-2069		WOS:000495961000033	35529709

We compare several expressed sequence tag (EST) in the ecologically important seagrass Zostera marina (eelgrass) to elucidate the molecular genetic basis of adaptation to environmental extremes. We compared the tentative unigene (TUG) frequencies of libraries derived from leaf and meristematic tissue from a control situation with two experimentally imposed temperature stress conditions and found that TUG composition is markedly different among these conditions (all P<0.0001). Under heat stress, we find that 63 TUGs are differentially expressed (d.e.) at 25 degrees C compared with lower, no-stress condition temperatures (4 degrees C and 17 degrees C). Approximately one-third of d.e. eelgrass genes were characteristic for the stress response of the terrestrial plant model Arabidopsis thaliana. The changes in gene expression suggest complex photosynthetic adjustments among light-harvesting complexes, reaction center subunits of photosystem I and II, and components of the dark reaction. Heat shock encoding proteins and reactive oxygen scavengers also were identified, but their overall frequency was too low to perform statistical tests. In all conditions, the most abundant transcript (3-15%) was a putative metallothionein gene with unknown function. We also find evidence that heat stress may translate to enhanced infection by protists. A total of 210 TUGs contain one or more microsatellites as potential candidates for gene-linked genetic markers.

Such n-type semiconducting oxide as WO3 (band gap, 2.5 eV) suffers from inadequate solar light absorption and, therefore, there is a need to use of a thin plasmon active layer of nanostructured Au of proper architecture to enhance the interfacial light trapping and conversion. A remarkable increase in the solar energy conversion efficiency as well as in the photooxidation current (oxygen evolution) are believed to be induced by the plasmonic excitation of Au nanoparticles occurring within WO3 absorption range. The polyoxometallate (PMo12O403-) monolayer-type nanostructures may play electrocatalytic role, improve charge distribution, in addition to the stabilization effect. In the other study, the PMo12O403- modified Au nanoparticles, when deposited on step-bunched silicon Si(111) surface have also acted as electrocatalytic centers during photoelectrochemically induced reduction of carbon oxide (IV). The applicability of phosphomolybdate-protected gold nanoparticles to create porous matrix for photoelectrochemically assisted reduction of carbon dioxide is even more pronounced when the system is further decorated with copper. We also present the result of decorating multi-walled carbon nanotubes with gold and copper nanoparticles (by chemical reduction method and through electrodeposition) acting as catalytic systems active towards CO2 electroreduction under voltammetric conditions. Carbon nanotubes have been chemically modified here with surface oxygen complexes using HNO3 and H3PMo12O40 solutions.

INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR SCIENCES				14	12			24169	24186		10.3390/ijms141224169				DEC 2013	2013	Plant respiratory burst oxidase homolog (rboh) genes appear to play crucial roles in plant development, defense reactions and hormone signaling. In this study, a total of seven rboh genes from grape were identified and characterized. Genomic structure and predicted protein sequence analysis indicated that the sequences of plant rboh genes are highly conserved. Synteny analysis demonstrated that several Vvrboh genes were found in corresponding syntenic blocks of Arabidopsis, suggesting that these genes arose before the divergence of the respective lineages. The expression pattern of Vvrboh genes in different tissues was assessed by qRT-PCR and two were constitutively expressed in all tissues tested. The expression profiles were similarly analyzed following exposure to various stresses and hormone treatments. It was shown that the expression levels of VvrbohA, VvrbohB and VvrbohC1 were significantly increased by salt and drought treatments. VvrbohB, VvrbohC2, and VvrbohD exhibited a dramatic up-regulation after powdery mildew (Uncinula necator (Schw.) Burr.) inoculation, while VvrbohH was down-regulated. Finally, salicylic acid treatment strongly stimulated the expression of VvrbohD and VvrbohH, while abscisic acid treatment induced the expression of VvrbohB and VvrbohH. These results demonstrate that the expression patterns of grape rboh genes exhibit diverse and complex stress-response expression signatures.									34	3	0	0	25	0	38				1422-0067		WOS:000330219800065	24351809

Herein, a novel porous honeycomb-like NiSe2/RP heterostructure is reported for the first time by in situ deposition of NiSe2 nanoparticles on the surface of red phosphorus (RP). The optimized binary NiSe2/RP composite showed superior photocatalytic H-2 evolution activity (1968.8 mu mol g(-1) h(-1)) from Na2S/Na2SO3 solution under solar light illumination, which was 2.32, 1.90, 1.59 and 1.21 times that of pristine RP, NiSe2, 5.3% FeS/RP and 8.1% NiS/RP, respectively. The formation process and function of various reactive oxygen species (& x2d9;OH, & x2d9;O-2(-) and H2O2), and the migration pathway of photocarriers are discussed in detail. Such a prominently improved photocatalytic performance could be ascribed to extended light absorption ability, massive reactive centers and lower interfacial transfer resistance, together with expedited charge separation, which arose from a successive two-electron/two-step reduction route. This study provides illuminating insights for the rational exploration and fabrication of potential photocatalytic systems with 0D/3D integrated nanoarchitecture and a multi-step electron transfer process for efficiently realizing solar energy capture and conversion.									25	2	0	0	2	0	26			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000519254300036	32101210

S-doped WO3 powders were prepared by solid-state annealing method using thiourea as S precursor. The crystal structure, composition and morphology of pure and S-doped WO3 were compared using scanning electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy. The influence of doping concentration and annealing temperature on the properties of S-doped WO3 powders and their photocatalytic activities under both ultraviolet (UV) and visible light (VIS) irradiation compared with WO3 were investigated. The results indicate that sulfur can be doped successfully into WO3 and the S-doped WO3 powder annealed at 500 degrees C exhibited the highest photocatalytic activity under both UV and visible light irradiation. The highest average oxygen evolution rate of S-doped WO3 under UV(99.9 mu mol L-1 g(-1) h(-1)) and visible light (76.7 mu mol L-1 g(-1) h(-1)) irradiation is 1.25 and 1.57 times the value of that of undoped WO3, respectively.

A competitively high oxygen evolution potential (2.4 V) and enhanced catalytic surface area were obtained, evidence by LSV and CV electrochemical characterization. The G/CNT-Ce/PbO2-Ce electrode possessed a more compact structure and a smaller grain size than the other PbO2 and Ce-PbO2 electrodes, exhibiting a prolonged service lifetime, evidence by accelerated lifespan test and recycling degradation experiment. As electrolysis time reached 120 min, the removal efficiency of ceftazidime and TOC arrived at 100.0% and 54.2% respectively in 0.05 M Na2SO4 solution containing 50 mg.L-1 ceftazidime. The effect of applied current density, pH value, initial ceftazidime concentration and chloride contents on the degradation performance were systematically evaluated. The results demonstrated that electrochemical oxidation of ceftazidime over the G/CNT-Ce/PbO2-Ce electrode was highly effective, and the mineralization rate was greatly improved, compared with pristine PbO2 electrode. Considering the toxicity was increased after 30 min electrolysis, the intermediates were quantitatively investigated through HPLC-MS, GC-MS and IC technology. According to the identified products, a reaction mechanism has been proposed and pyridine and aminothiazole were detected with concentration from approximately 1 to 3 mg,L-1, which were regarded as toxic byproducts during electrooxidation. Further electrocatalyzing by ring cleavage reaction and complete mineralization to CO2, NO3- and NH4+ was proposed, which demonstrated the G/CNT-Ce/PbO2-Ce electrode exhibited high efficiency for ceftazidime removal in mild conditions.

The present study investigated the effects of light and O-2 on bacteriochlorophyll contents and the transcription levels of photosynthesis-related genes in Chloroflexus aurantiacus J-10-fl(T). Under aerobic conditions, C. aurantiacus produced marked amounts of bacteriochlorophylls in the presence of light, although their production was strongly suppressed in the dark. The transcription levels of genes related to the synthesis of bacteriochlorophylls, photosy stems, and chlorosomes: bchM, bchU, pufL, pufBA, and csmM, were markedly increased by illumination. These results suggest that C. aurantiacus continuously synthesizes ATP by photophosphorylation even in the presence of O-2.									2	0	0	0	2	0	2			1342-6311			WOS:000585925800002	32418929	
J	Suzuki, T; Yokouchi, K; Kawamichi, H; Yamamoto, Y; Uda, K; Yuasa, HJ								Comparison of the sequences of Turbo and Sulculus indoleamine dioxygenase-like myoglobin genes								GENE				308				89	94		10.1016/S0378-1119(03)00467-0				APR 10 2003	2003	Some archaeogastropodic molluscs, including Sulculus and Turbo, contain an unusual similar to 40 kDa myoglobin in their buccal masses. This myoglobin can bind oxygen reversibly, but has a lower oxygen affinity than vertebrate and invertebrate myoglobins. Amino acid sequences clearly show that Sulculus and Turbo myoglobins evolved not from the globin gene but from the gene for indoleamine dioxygenase (IDO), a tryptophan-degrading enzyme. The Turbo myoglobin gene has been determined to consist of 14 exons and 13 introns. Compared with the known Sulculus IDO-like myoglobin gene, all splice junctions except two are conserved exactly between the two genes. The exon/intron organization of these myoglobin genes is also highly homologous with human IDO (ten exon/nine intron structure); splice junctions of six introns were exactly conserved among the three genes, suggesting that these introns have been conserved for at least 600 million years. To look for putative IDO genes in Turbo or Sulculus, we re-examined the genomic DNA fragments amplified by PCR in full detail, and found intron 2 in two distinct Sulculus fragments (A and B). Fragment A with a 576 bp intron corresponded exactly to the myoglobin gene of Sulculus. On the other hand, fragment B, containing a 239 bp intron, differed significantly from fragment A in nucleotide and translated amino acid sequences. Detailed sequence comparison suggests that fragment B may be derived from a putative IDO gene of Sulculus. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science B.V.

The elementary reactions that are part of the selective oxidation catalysis, such as substrate bond activation or oxygen insertion, are introduced.This is followed by a discussion of basic electronic features of the valence electron structure of oxide materials. We will initially compare the chemical bonding and reactivity of compounds with dominantly ionic versus covalent bonding. Surface reactivity descriptors for the two types of chemical bonds are indicated. It will appear that, except for longer range ionic interactions, binding to the metal cations is dominated by local covalent interactions and that ligand field theory type atomic orbital splitting as well as rehybridisation are important. Trends in bonding as a function of position of reducible metal in the periodic system are emphasized throughout the paper.At the surface, in addition to the changes in electronic structure, atom position relaxation and surfacere construction effects may also have a large influence on the differences in reactivity.The reactivity of the oxygen atoms varies. They can be proton acceptors and generate Bronsted acidity, can assist heterolytic or radical type C H bond activation or when electrophilic will insert into hydrocarbon double bonds.At the end of the paper trends in catalytic reactivity are analyzed. The double volcano type curve found for the dependence of catalytic reactivity on the position of cation in the third row of the periodic system is shown to relate to the distribution of electrons with high spin over the ligand field split atomic orbitals of the respective cations. This will be discussed in the context of classical catalytic results that are based on Balandin type volcano plots of reactivity versus the catalyst material reactivity parameters.

Herein, we report a facile one-pot approach for the successful fabrication of PtRhCu ternary alloy nanodendrites. For the methanol oxidation reaction (MOR), the electro-catalytic performances of the as-prepared nanocrystals can be optimized by simply varying the amount of Rh precursor. The mass activity and specific activity of the as-obtained Pt47Rh8Cu45 nanodendrites are 2.9 and 5.8 times as high as that of commercial Pt/C catalyst, respectively. Besides, after the accelerated durability test (ADT) for 1500 cycles, the remaining specific activity of Pt(47)Rh(8)Cu(45 )nanodendrites is 7.8 folds enhancement compared to commercial Pt/C, indicating the excellent stability of the PtRhCu catalyst. We believe that the improved electrochemical activity and stability could be resulted from the highly dendritic nanostructure and the synergetic effect of the three metallic elements in the alloy.									11	1	0	0	1	0	11			0254-0584	1879-3312		WOS:000566398000012

Here, the design and synthesis of micromotors is reported based on mesoporous silica particles containing bipyridine groups, introduced by cocondensation, for entrapping catalytic cobalt(II) ions within the mesochannels, and functionalized on the surface with silane-derived temperature responsive bottle-brush polyphosphazene. Switching the polymers in a narrow temperature window of 25-30 degrees C between the swollen and collapsed state, allows the access for the fuel H2O2 contained in the dispersion medium to cobalt(II) bipyridinato catalyst sites. The decomposition of hydrogen peroxide is monitored by optical microscopy, and effectively operated by reversibly closing or opening the pores by the grafted gate-like polyphosphazene, to control on demand the oxygen bubble generation. This design represents one of the few examples using temperature as a trigger for the reversible on-off external switching of mesoporous silica micromotors.									7	0	0	0	2	0	7			1022-1336	1521-3927		WOS:000491769200001	31637803

A one-stage fluidized bed reactor was used to study the characteristics of gas-liquid-solid products and the migration regulation of C/H/O elements during biomass pyrolysis. The specific conclusions are as follows: the char yield decreases from 24.3 %-14.9 % during pyrolysis from 500 degrees C to 800 degrees C. The tar yield decreases from 16.9 % to less than 5 %, while the gas yield increases from 24 % to 71.3 %. The graphitization of biochar decreases and its aromaticity increases during pyrolysis. The form of hydrogen existing in biochar is converted from aliphatic hydrogen to aromatic hydrogen during pyrolysis. The content of weaken-bound oxygen such as carboxyl and aldehyde decreases significantly while the content of strong-bound oxygen such as C-O and C-O-C is essentially unchanged. The peak emission of CO during the instantaneous combustion of biochar increases from 0.0013 L/(g min to 0.0032 L/(g min at 500 degrees C to 800 degrees C. The tar starts its aromatization at 700 degrees C. The aliphatic component disappears from 33 % at 500 degrees C-600 degrees C. The double bond equivalent parameter of tar increases significantly, while its H/C ratio and O/C ratio both decrease. The yields of CO/CO2/CH4 increase significantly from 500 degrees C to 700 degrees C. H-2 starts to appear at 700 degrees C. A noticeable CH4 steam reforming reaction starts when raising to 800 degrees C, leading to a decrease in CH4 yield and an increase in CO yield and H-2 yield. C/H/O elements in biochar and tar are gradually lost during pyrolysis. The gas phase becomes the main existing form of C/H/O elements after raising to 700 degrees C.									14	0	0	0	3	0	14			0165-2370	1873-250X		WOS:000663089100006

Membr. 5 (1988) 1289-1296 (in Russian)). In the following paper the half-time of luminescence decay (tau 1/2) is shown to be 6 ms at 66-78-degrees-C. This value coincides in order of magnitude with the tau 1/2 values for higher plants, suggestive of a similar mechanism behind. PS I luminescence is inhomogeneous in thermophiles. In the presence of DCIP-H-2 the amplitude of the main band at 78-degrees-C shows a sharp rise and an additional more thermolabile band appears at 66-78-degrees-C. The splitting of the PS I peak is probably caused by a charge in the steady-state distribution of charges between the secondary acceptors. The abstraction of oxygen leads to marked changes in the profiles of the temperature dependence curves and to a rise in the DL intensity. Along with these changes the photodynamic destruction of chlorophyll decreases, electron transport becomes more stable and degree of reversibility of thermally-activated delayed luminescence increases. Besides oxygen, delayed luminescence is quenched with high efficiency by halogen ions (Cl-, Br-, I-) and NO3- ions. The findings suggest at least two processes behind the thermal stimulation effect: the temperature-induced increase in the charge recombination rate and the heat-induced impairment of the mechanism responsible for the quenching of excited states of chlorophyll of the PS I reaction center. The latter process is presumably dominant.									4	0	0	0	3	0	4			0006-3002			WOS:A1993LG44100012		
J	Yang, Li; Jiao, Yong; Jia, Dongyan; Li, Yanzhi; Liao, Chuanhua								Role of oxygen vacancies and Sr sites in SrCo0.8Fe0.2O3 perovskite on efficient activation of peroxymonosulfate towards the degradation of aqueous organic pollutants								CHINESE JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL ENGINEERING				40				269	277		10.1016/j.cjche.2021.10.015				DEC 2021	2021	Metal-based perovskite oxides have contributed significantly to the advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) due to their diverse active sites and excellent compositional/structural flexibility. In this study, we specially designed a perovskite oxide with abundant oxygen vacancies, SrCo0.8Fe0.2O3 (SCF), and firstly applied it as a catalyst in peroxymonosulfate (PMS) activation towards organic pollutants degradation. The result revealed that the prepared SCF catalyst exhibited excellent performance on organic compounds degradation. Besides, SCF showed much better activity than La0.5Sr0.5Co0.8Fe0.2O3 (LSCF) in terms of reaction rate and stability for the degradation of the organic compounds. Based on the analysis of scanning electron microscope, transmission electron microscope, X-ray diffraction, N-2 adsorption-desorption, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and electron paramagnetic resonance, it was confirmed that the perovskite catalysts with high content of Sr doping at A-site could effectively create a defect-rich surface and optimize its physicochemical properties, which was responsible for the excellent heterogeneous catalytic activity of SCF. SCF can generate three highly active species: O-1(2), SO4-center dot and center dot OH in PMS activation, revealing the degradation process of organic compounds was a coupled multiple active species in both radical and nonradical pathway. Moreover, it was mainly in a radical pathway in the degradation through PMS activation on SCF and SO4-center dot radicals produced were the dominant species in SCF/PMS system. This study demonstrated that perovskite-type catalysts could enrich OVs efficiently by doping strategy and regulate the PMS activation towards sulfate radical-based AOPs.

The Purang ophiolite located in the western part of Yarlung Zangbo suture zone is characterized by containing a large mantle peridotite massif ca.600km~2 in area. In order to discuss the petrogenesis and tectonic significance of the Purang peridotite massif, the authors sampled a section of about 10 km across the massif in the eastern part of the Purang mantle peridotite massif. Based on a detailed field survey and mineralogical and geochemical analysis of systematically selected mantle peridotite samples, the authors have achieved some results: (1)The lithofacies distribution of the Purang ophiolite peridotites has been determined. The profile across the massif shows that harzburgites form the main part of the Purang peridotite massif, the harzburgites are mainly located within the peridotite massif, the banded lherzolites are mainly distributed at the edge of the peridotite massif, and the ratio of the exposed area of harzburgites to that of lherzolites is about 4:1; (2)Based on olivine-spinel associations and the formulae based on the reaction of 6Fe_2SiO_4+O_2= 3Fe_2Si_2O_6 + 2Fe_3O_4, the oxygen fugacity values have been calculated (?log(fo_2)FMQ range from-1.11 to + 0.45), which are significantly higher than the fo_2 value obtained using the V content, indicating a reducing tectonic setting; (3)The Purang peridotites are not the simple residues of partial melting and might have experienced later melts metasomatism. According to the whole rock geochemistry and oxygen fugacity values, this paper argues that the later metasomatic melts were probably derived from the lower partial melting magma formed in a mid-ocean ridge setting; (4)The Purang ophiolite peridotites show similar bulk geochemical features and oxygen fugacity characteristics to the modern mid-ocean ridge abyssal peridotites. It is thus held that the Purang ophiolite peridotites formed in a mid-ocean ridge tectonic setting, without imprints of supra-subduction zone setting. The two stage evolution model (MORSSZ)of the peridotites from the Yarlung Zangbo suture zone needs to be reexamined.			蛇绿岩中的地幔橄榄岩是蛇绿岩的重要组成部分,不仅记录了其所经历的板块构造事件,还可以探讨地幔的物质组成和深部地幔作用。位于雅江缝合带西段的普兰蛇绿岩以出露面积约600 km~2的特大型地幔橄榄岩体而引人注目。为了探讨普兰蛇绿岩地幔橄榄岩的成因,本文在普兰地幔橄榄岩体的东段完成了一条穿过岩体的长约10 km的地质剖面,对地幔橄榄岩进行了系统采样,开展了详细矿物学、地球化学研究,取得以下主要进展和认识:(1)普兰地幔橄榄岩中的二辉橄榄岩经历了9%~15%的部分熔融作用,方辉橄榄岩最终经历了15%~25%的部分熔融作用;(2)基于橄榄石-尖晶石矿物化学平衡计算的普兰地幔橄榄岩氧逸度?log(fo_2)~(FMQ)值从-1.11到+0.45,略高于用V-Y含量估算出的氧逸度(在FMQ到FMQ-1趋势),指示其形成于还原环境;(3)普兰地幔橄榄岩不是简单的地幔残余,还经历了后期熔体交代作用。对普兰地幔橄榄岩交代产生类似"U"型稀土配分模式的熔体可能是洋中脊(MOR)环境产生的低融岩浆;(4)地幔橄榄岩地球化学特征及氧逸度计算结果表明,普兰地幔橄榄岩可能形成于洋中脊(MOR)环境,并没有俯冲带(SSZ)环境的印记。对于普兰地幔橄榄岩以及雅鲁藏布江缝合带其他岩体的成因,前人主要根据地幔橄榄岩一些元素的富集特征提出的MORSSZ两阶段演化模式需要重新审视。						4	5	0	0	0	0	7			1000-3657			CSCD:5540864

The outstanding electrocatalytic performance of H-CCS-Ns is mainly attributed to its distinctive hollow structure, which accelerates the electron transfer rate and provides abundant active sites. Moreover, a mechanism study indicates that H-CCS-Ns has highly active octahedral Co3+, and the existence of Co3+ cations optimizes the adsorption of oxygen-involved intermediates, making H-CCS-Ns a promising OER electrocatalyst. Optimized H-CCS-Ns only need an ultralow overpotential of 220 mV to drive a current density of 10 mA.cm(-2) and exhibit distinguished cycling stability with a negligible fluctuation for 30 h. More impressively, when H-CCS-Ns are assembled with Pt/C for overall water splitting, a voltage as low as 1.545 V is required at a current density of 10 mA.cm(-2), and the catalyst shows outstanding stability for as long as 38 h. This study offers a feasible strategy to design hollow spinel catalysts for efficient OER catalysis.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			0020-1669	1520-510X		WOS:000765784500020	35143186	
J	Gillis, K. M.; Coogan, L. A.								Secular variation in carbon uptake into the ocean crust								EARTH AND PLANETARY SCIENCE LETTERS				302	3-4			385	392		10.1016/j.epsl.2010.12.030				FEB 1 2011	2011	Carbonate mineral precipitation in the upper oceanic crust during low-temperature, off-axis, hydrothermal circulation is investigated using new estimates of the bulk CO2 content of seven DSDP/ODP drill cores. In combination with previously published data these new data show: (i) the CO2 content of the upper similar to 300 m of the crust is substantially higher in Cretaceous than in Cenozoic crust and (ii) for any age of crust, there is substantially more CO2 in Atlantic (slow-spreading) than Pacific (intermediate- to fast-spreading) crust. Modelling the Sr-isotopic composition of the carbonates suggests that > 80% of carbonate mineral formation occurs within < 20 Myr of crust formation. This means that the higher CO2 content of Cretaceous crust reflects a secular change in the rate of CO2 uptake by the crust. Oxygen isotope derived estimates of carbonate mineral precipitation temperatures show that the average and minimum temperature of carbonate precipitation was similar to 10 degrees C higher temperatures in the Cretaceous than in the Cenozoic. This difference is consistent with previous estimates of secular change in bottom seawater temperature. Higher fluid temperature within the crust will have increased reaction rates potentially liberating more basaltic Ca and hence enhancing carbonate mineral precipitation. Additionally, if crustal fluid pH is controlled by fluid-rock reaction, the higher Ca content of the Cretaceous ocean will also have enhanced carbonate mineral precipitation. New estimates of the rate of CO2 uptake by the upper ocean crust during the Cenozoic are much lower than previous estimates. (c) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

The OECs were deposited by cycles of (i) open-circuit potential (OCP) and (ii) applying a potential positive enough to oxidize the metallic precursor on the WO3/BiVO4. The crystalline and optical properties of the photoanodes were not significantly affected by the OECs deposition. However, there was a remarkable increase in the photocurrent densities (j(pc)) to water oxidation, where the modification with FePi showed the best result, achieving 2.12 mA cm(-2), which corresponds to 2.83 times higher than the heterojunction without the OECs. Furthermore, the OECs deposition changed the morphology of the heterojunction with the deposition of a thin film on its surface. In addition, during the FePi deposition, the BiVO4 layer seems to partially dissolve. Our study shows a facile methodology to boost the activity of photoanodes to the water oxidation by photoelectrodeposition of OECs.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0103-5053	1678-4790		WOS:000806910000010

J	Xu, Qianghui; Liu, Zhiming; Jiang, Hang; Zhang, Qiang; Zan, Cheng; Ma, Desheng; Shi, Lin				Zhang, Qiang/B-1799-2012	Zhang, Qiang/0000-0002-3929-1541; Jiang, Hang/0000-0003-3409-5944			Chemical-structural properties of the coke produced by low temperature oxidation reactions during crude oil in-situ combustion								FUEL				207				179	188		10.1016/j.fuel.2017.06.026				NOV 1 2017	2017	Chemical-structural properties of the coke produced by crude oil low temperature oxidation (LTO) reactions during in-situ combustion are still highly lacking due to the difficulty in coked sand characterization. This study proposed an experimental methodology to prepare the useful LTO coke with the chemical-structural properties studied using a combination of Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, attenuated total reflection Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction (XRD) and high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) techniques. The XRD and the HRTEM analyses showed the LTO coke mainly consisted of highly disorder amorphous structures with limited amount of poorly order 'onion-like' structures. The LTO coke was found to contain numerous oxygen functionalities and highly-substituted aromatic rings. The concentration of the carbonyl showed no significant decline with the LTO temperature increasing to 310 degrees C. Nevertheless, the carbon structure with sp(3)-rich characteristics was found to selectively consumed by O-2 to reduce the amount of coke deposition, and enriched the aromatic layer systems as inferred by Raman and FTIR analyses. There was a good agreement between the amount of the 'onion-like' structures viewed from HRTEM and the changes in the ether bridging groups. Additionally, the changes in the coke chemical-structural properties agreed with the measured coke reactivity by Thermogravimetric analyses. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

To tackle the drawbacks, herein, MAPbBr(3)/carbon sphere (CS) compos-ite photocatalysts using glucose as the carbon source were elaborately designed and fabricated via a dry mechanochemical grinding process. The interfacial interaction Pb-O-C chemical bonds were constructed between MAPbBr(3) and the carbon sphere surface containing organic functional groups. By optimizing the content of CSs, the enhanced photo-catalytic degradation kinetic rate of Malachite Green (MG) pollutants (92% within 20 min) for MAPbBr(3)/CSx (x = 17 wt.%) is about 3.6-fold of that for pristine MAPbBr(3), which is attributed to the corporative adsorption and enhanced carrier transportation and separation of MAPbBr(3)/CSx. Furthermore, the possible degradation mechanism was proposed on basis of the electrochemical, mass spectrometry and optical characterization results. Owing to the robust interfacial interaction, effective electron extraction rate (k(et) = 4.6 x 10(7) sec(-1)) from MAPbBr(3) to CS can be established, which driven oxygen activation where superoxide radicals (center dot O-2(-)) played an important role in MG degradation. It is expected that mechanochemistry strategy may provide a new route to design efficient lead halide perovskite-carbon or metal oxide or sulfide composite photocatalysts.

Cytochrome P450 monooxygenases, also known as CYPs/P450s, are broadly distributed in organisms and are involved in a diverse array of molecular/metabolic processes. In this study, using reverse transcription quantitative PCR analysis, we observed that the expression of a P450 gene (Chr2g00380) in the E-class P450, group IV from V. dahliae isolate JR2 was highly induced during tomato infection. Targeted deletion of Chr2g00380 in JR2 did not affect hyphal growth and morphology; however, the mutants exhibited increased sensitivity to H2O2 and defects in melanized microsclerotia formation compared with the wild type. Loss of Chr2g00380 resulted in reduced virulence on tomato and tobacco plants but did not cause phenotypic changes in infection structure formation or in the penetration of cellophane membranes. These data provide evidence for an involvement of a cytochrome P450 monooxygenase in virulence in V. dahliae.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0031-949X	1943-7684		WOS:000812964200001	35224980

Binder metals such as Cr and Ni were completely melted and WC was decomposed partially to W2C and graphite during the high temperature (up to 3500 degrees C) thermal spraying. The melted metals were bonded with WC and other carbides and were formed as WC-metal coating. The graphite and excessively sprayed oxygen formed carbon oxide gases, and these gases formed porous coating by evolution of the gases. The surface properties were improved by HVOF coating and were improved further by CO2 laser heat treatment (LH). Wear resistance of In718 surface was improved by coating and LH at 25 degrees C and an elevated temperature of 450 degrees C, resulting in reduction of wear trace traces, and was further improved by LH of the coating in reducing wear depth. Corrosion resistance due to coating in sea water was improved by LH. HVOF coating of WC-metal powder on a metal surface and a LH of the coating were highly recommended for the improvement of In718 surface properties, the friction behavior, and wear resistance.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			1687-8434	1687-8442		WOS:000358521000001		
J	Nmor, Stanley, I; Viollier, Eric; Pastor, Lucie; Lansard, Bruno; Rabouille, Christophe; Soetaert, Karline								FESDIA (v1.0): exploring temporal variations of sediment biogeochemistry under the influence of flood events using numerical modelling								GEOSCIENTIFIC MODEL DEVELOPMENT				15	19			7325	7351		10.5194/gmd-15-7325-2022				OCT 4 2022	2022	Episodic events of flood deposit in coastal environments are characterized by deposition of large quantities of sediment containing reactive organic matter within short periods of time. While steady-state modelling is common in sediment biogeochemical modelling, the inclusion of these events in current early diagenesis models has yet to be demonstrated. We adapted an existing model of early diagenetic processes to include the ability to mimic an immediate organic carbon deposition. The new model version (FESDIA) written in Fortran and R programming language was able to reproduce the basic trends from field sediment porewater data affected by the November 2008 flood event in the Rhone River prodelta. Simulation experiments on two end-member scenarios of sediment characteristics dictated by field observation (1-high thickness deposit, with low TOC (total organic carbon) and 2-low thickness, with high TOC), reveal contrasting evolutions of post-depositional profiles. A first-order approximation of the differences between subsequent profiles was used to characterize the timing of recovery (i.e. relaxation time) from this alteration. Our results indicate a longer relaxation time of approximately 4 months for SO42- and 5 months for DIC (dissolved inorganic carbon) in the first scenario, and less than 3 months for the second scenario which agreed with timescale observed in the field. A sensitivity analysis across a spectrum of these end-member cases for the organic carbon content (described as the enrichment factor alpha) and for sediment thickness indicates that the relaxation time for oxygen, sulfate, and DIC decreases with increasing organic enrichment for a sediment deposition that is less than 5 cm. However, for larger deposits (> 14 cm), the relaxation time for oxygen, sulfate, and DIC increases with alpha. This can be related to the depth-dependent availability of oxidant and the diffusion of species. This study emphasizes the significance of these sediment characteristics in determining the sediment's short-term response in the presence of an episodic event. Furthermore, the model described here provides a useful tool to better understand the magnitude and dynamics of flooding event on biogeochemical reactions on the seafloor.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1991-959X	1991-9603		WOS:000863617300001

First, rates of oxygen evolution were determined in the presence of various concentrations of benzoquinones and the two kinetic parameters, K(m) and V(max), were estimated from double reciprocal plots. The V(max) value increased with increasing hydrophobicity of quinone molecules, suggesting that the hydrophobicity of acceptor molecules is an important factor affecting the terminal limiting step of quinone reduction. The K(m) values agreed with the binding constants of the Q(B) site for corresponding benzoquinones which were determined by the second spectrophotometric metric method. Thus, the first method offers a simple and convenient procedure to estimate the affinities of quinone acceptors to the Q(B) site. In the second method, fractions of the Q(B) domains occupied by 3(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-1,1-dimethylurea (DCMU) were determined by measuring the magnitude of the Q(A)-Q(B) to Q(A)Q(B)- transition. DCMU reduced the magnitude of Q(A)-oxidation by 50% at 60 nM. The inhibition was significantly reversed on addition of benzoquinones, indicating that quinone molecules bind to the Q(B) domain in competition with DCMU and, once bound, serve as electron acceptors of Q(A). The binding constants of the Q(B) site for benzoquinones were estimated from quinone-induced changes in the concentration of DCMU required to occupy 50% of the Q(B) domains. No evidence was obtained to indicate the occurrence of oxidation of the iron (II) located near Q(A) and Q(B) under the assay conditions, which otherwise would affect the estimation of the binding constant. The relationship between the binding affinity and the molecular structure of benzoquinones is discussed.									39	1	0	0	34	0	40			0006-3002			WOS:A1992JM75200005

The oxidation of this LPS SiC ceramic was found to be passive throughout these temperatures due to the formation of oxide scales, with a change in the oxidation behavior occurring at 1350 degrees C. It was also found that the oxidation behavior is very complex, exhibiting two distinct stages at all temperatures: (i) initial nonparabolic oxidation, where the rate-limiting mechanism is the outward diffusion of Y3+ and Al3+ cations from the secondary intergranular phase into the oxide scale with the activation energy of the oxidation being 504 +/- 32 kJ/mol, followed by (ii) parabolic oxidation below 1350 degrees C, where the rate-determining mechanism is the inward diffusion of oxygen through the oxide scale with the activation energy being 310 +/- 47 kJ/mol, or paralinear oxidation at and above 1350 degrees C, where oxidation is controlled by some mixed reaction/diffusion process. The existence of two oxidation regimes reflects the progressive crystallization of the oxide scale during the oxidation. Finally, guidelines are provided for the design and fabrication of low-cost, highly oxidation-resistant LPS SiC or other LPS nonoxide ceramics.									10	0	0	0	0	0	10			0884-2914	2044-5326		WOS:000256392600025

In order to ensure stable performance profiles over time, large amounts (>= 1 mg.cm(-2)) of noble metals (Au, Pt, Ir) are most widely used to coat titanium-based PTLs. However, their high cost is still a major obstacle toward commercialization and widespread application. In this paper, we assess different loadings of iridium, ranging from 0.005 to 0.05 mg.cm(-2) in titanium PTLs, that consequently affect the investment costs of PEM water electrolyzers. Concerning a reduction in the precious metal costs, we found that Ir as a protective layer with a loading of 0.025 mg. cm(-2) on the PTLs would be sufficient to achieve the same cell performance as PTLs with a higher Ir loading. This Ir loading is a 40-fold reduction over the Au or Pt loading typically used for protective layers in current commercial PEM water electrolyzers. We show that the Ir protective layer here not only decreases the Ohmic resistance significantly, which is the largest part of the gain in performance, but moreover, the oxygen evolution reaction activity of the iridium layer makes it promising as a cost-effective catalyst layer. Our work also confirms that the proper construction of a multifunctional interface between a membrane and a PTL indeed plays a crucial role in guaranteeing the superior performance and efficiency of electrochemical devices.									10	0	0	0	0	0	10			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000641156600020	33798332

In this regard, hydrogen is clean, energy-rich fuel with unlimited potential. It can be produced via water-splitting process using the most abundant resources on earth, that is, water and solar/electrical energy. Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) are a category of porous crystalline materials with well-organized structures and unique catalytic, optical, and electrical properties. MOFs and MOF-derived materials have proved to be excellent catalysts for water-splitting both by electrochemical and photoelectrochemical (PEC) routes. Furthermore, photochemical and electrochemical capabilities of these MOFs can be fine-tuned to maximize their performance by modification in the bandgap, surface area, current density, electrochemical active surface area, and overpotential, through tailoring of the organic ligands and/or metal centers. A number of works have been dedicated to this quest resulting in promising and very effective results. Such as for photoelectrocatalysis, a composite nanorod array of TiO2/Co-MOF acting as photoanode achieved one of the highest photocurrent densities of 2.93 mA/cm(2)at 1.23 V (vs reverse hydrogen electrode [RHE]). In another study, MOF-derived Co3C-3/TiO(2)photoanode attained the photocurrent density of 2.6 mA/cm(2)at 1.23 V vs RHE. For electrocatalysis, Fe2O3/Ni-MOF-74 exhibited oxygen evolution reaction overpotential of 264 mV to reach 10 mA/cm(2)of current density with a low Tafel plot of 48 mV/dec. Another novel material derived from MOF, MoO2-PC-rGO displayed a Tafel Plot of 41 mV/dec. Even though this field is in its infancy phase, it is attracting increased attention for promising results suggesting extraordinary potential for practical applications. Focus of this review article is on the overview of the development of MOFs for application in electrocatalytic and photoelectrocatalytic water-splitting for hydrogen production. This review intends to provide a timely reference and insight for the advancement in catalysts based on MOFs for practical electrochemical and PEC water-splitting in a clear and comprehensive manner. Starting with the brief introduction, fundamentals, factors affecting catalytic efficiency and evaluation parameters of water-splitting are summarized followed by synthesis strategies and recent progress made by MOF-based catalysts for PEC and electrochemical water-splitting.									61	2	0	0	4	0	60			0363-907X	1099-114X		WOS:000561937400001

A pivotal role of phospholipase A (PLA(2)) and platelet-activating factor-acetylhydrolase (PAF-AcH) as enzymes involved in lung inflammation has recently been suggested. The objective of this study was to elucidate the role and the time dependence of PLA(2) and PAF-AcH fluctuations in the lung relative to the evolution of intestinal ischemia-reperfusion (IIR).Materials and methods. Rats were randomly allocated to five groups of IIR induced by occlusion of the superior mesenteric artery for 45 min followed by 1 min, 2, 4, and 8 h of reperfusion (expGroups) and five corresponding sham groups (sGroups). Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid was obtained from the right lung and its biochemical (protein, PLA(2), PAF-AcH) and cytological characteristics were determined. Plasma malonyldialdehyde was measured as a marker of lipid peroxidation. The 4 and 8 h reperfusion expGroups had significantly (P < 0.05) elevated alveolar-arterial O-2 gradient values compared with the corresponding controls. Total protein, PLA2 and PAF-AcH levels significantly (P < 0.05) increased in expGroups compared with the corresponding shams after 4 h of reperfusion. Total bronchoalveolar lavage fluid cells and plasma malonyldialdehyde were significantly (P < 0.05) elevated in expGroups compared with the sGroups after 2 h of reperfusion.Conclusions. PIA could act synergistically or parallel with the reactive oxygen species produced during IIR, resulting in the induction or even in the exacerbation of the inflammatory reaction in acute respiratory distress syndrome. PAF-AcH could play an anti-inflammatory role by reducing the concentration of PAF. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.									34	4	0	0	26	2	38			0022-4804			WOS:000255668500016	17981297	
J	Liu, Lin; Liu, Jiaqing; Sun, Kailong; Wan, Jun; Fu, Feng; Fan, Jun								Novel phosphorus-doped Bi2WO6 monolayer with oxygen vacancies for superior photocatalytic water detoxication and nitrogen fixation performance								CHEMICAL ENGINEERING JOURNAL				411						128629	10.1016/j.cej.2021.128629		JAN 2021		MAY 1 2021	2021	Chemical phosphorus doping has recently regarded as an effective method for band gap and charge transfer kinetics regulation of semiconductor photocatalysts. However, few more P-doped photocatalysts are investigated except TiO2 and g-C3N4 systems up to now. Herein, a novel phosphorus-doped Bi2WO6 (PBWO) monolayer with oxygen vacancies was successfully synthesized through a facile one-step hydrothermal treatment using elemental red phosphorus (RP) as P source. Particularly, P atoms were doped into the lattice of Bi2WO6 in [BiO](+) layers via forming Bi-O-P bonds, and rich oxygen vacancies were introduced by phosphorus doping process. The optimized PBWO sample exhibits a remarkable visible-light photocatalytic simultaneous degradation of Cr(VI) and tetracycline hydrochloride activity, and a satisfactory photocatalytic nitrogen fixation rate of 73.6 mu mol g(-1) h(-1) under simulated light irradiation, which is significantly enhanced compared to pristine BWO and phosphorus containing heterostructures of BiPO4/Bi2WO6 and RP/Bi2WO6. Based on the results of various characterizations and DFT calculations, the superior photocatalytic performance of PBWO can be attributed to the synergistic effect of phosphorus doping coupled with oxygen vacancies, which improves the visible light absorption, modulates the band structure, introduces a defect level in the forbidden band, and effectively promotes the separation efficiency of photogenerated electron-hole pairs. The detailed photocatalytic mechanism was further proposed according to the radical capturing experiment and ESR technology.									40	1	0	0	3	0	39			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000624513800001

Variations presented in the density of donors, the flatband potential and the fraction of species measured by XPS, in the region of characterization of these films are associated with changes in the ratio of different Ti sub-oxides within the passive film. Oxygen and hydroxyl vacancies and their respective formation rate constants are estimated from EIS spectra fits with a modified Point Defect Model. A consistent behavior is observed for the hydration state and structural transformations of the films as a function of potential. Films anodized at less positive potentials than 1.17 V vs SCE present higher hydroxyl vacancy diffusivities (e.g higher film hydration) and a heterogeneous mixture of titanium sub-oxides, whereas the opposite behavior is observed for films formed at more positive potentials than 1.17 V vs SCE, where the hydroxyl vacancy diffusivities decrease by one order of magnitude and the oxygen vacancy diffusivities increase three times. Thus, films anodized at more positive potentials present a higher dehydration, are more homogeneous and mainly composed of TiO2. (C) 2013 The Electrochemical Society.

The radical represents the transformation of charge into a nascent catalytic intermediate, which lacks a newly formed bond and is therefore inherently difficult to detect. Here, using theoretical calculations and ultrafast in situ infrared spectroscopy of photocatalysis at an n-SrTiO3/aqueous interface, we reveal a subsurface vibration of the oxygen directly below, and uniquely generated by, the oxyl radical (Ti-O-center dot). Intriguingly, this interfacial Ti-O stretch vibration, once decoupled from the lattice, couples to reactant dynamics (water librations). These experiments demonstrate subsurface vibrations and their coupling to solvent and electron dynamics to detect nascent catalytic intermediates at the solid-liquid interface at the molecular level. One can envision using the subsurface vibrations and their coupling across the interface to track and control catalysis dynamically.									87	2	0	0	9	0	87			1755-4330	1755-4349		WOS:000376529000009	27219698

Two specific extrinsic proteins, PsbP and PsbQ, bind to the lumenal surface of PSII in green plants and maintain OEC conformation and stabilize overall enzymatic function; however, their precise location has not been fully resolved. In this study, PSII-enriched membranes, isolated from spinach, were subjected to chemical cross-linking combined with release-reconstitution experiments. We observed direct interactions between PsbP and PsbE, as well as with PsbR. Intriguingly, PsbP and PsbQ were further linked to the CP26 and CP43 light-harvesting proteins. In addition, two cross-linked sites, between PsbP and PsbR, and that of PsbP and CP26, were identified by tandem mass spectrometry. These data were used to estimate the binding topology and location of PsbP, and the putative positioning of PsbQ and PsbR on the lumenal surface of the PSII. Our model gives new insights into the organization of PSII extrinsic subunits in higher plants and their function in stabilizing the OEC of the PSII supercomplex.									39	2	0	0	37	0	41			0021-9258	1083-351X		WOS:000339395200028	24914208

Results showed that over 99.9% of the M. aeruginosa cells were removed in 60 min when 0.2 mM Fe2+ was added to the system. The pseudo-first order rate constant for BDD-CF-Fe2+ system was almost 15 times higher than that (0.005 min(-1)) for BDD-CF system. The excellent performance of the BDD-CF-Fe2+ system over the BDD-CF system was observed over a wide range of pH from 3 to 9. Based on the evolution of Fe2+/Fe3+, pH, H2O2 and OH, mechanism of enhanced removal of M. aeruginosa was revealed in the BDD-CF-Fe2+ system. H2O2 was electrochemically generated through reduction of dissolved oxygen on the surface of the CF cathode, and the added Fe+ was rapidly adsorbed and precipitated also on the CF cathode. Comparisons of BDD-CF-Fe2+, BDD-CF-Fe3+ and BDD-CF-Fe2+/Fe3+ systems proved that the electrochemical reduction of Fe(III) to Fe(II) could guarantee the sustainable cycle between Fe(II) and Fe(III). Through heterogeneous electro-Fenton reactions, much higher amount of OH would be continuously generated compared with the BDD-CF system. Thereby, the lipid peroxidation on the cell membrane of M. aeruginosa was intensified through the addition of Fe2+. Moreover, the degradation of intracellular microcystin was remarkably accelerated, and the extracellular microcystin was controlled more safely due to Fe2+ addition. This study provided an alternative method to enhance the electrochemical mitigation of cyanobacteria-polluted waters. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

J	Nellis, Chris; Hin, Celine								Kinetic Monte Carlo modeling of homogeneous precipitation of Y-O and Y-Ti-O Oxides in bulk alpha iron								JOURNAL OF MATERIALS SCIENCE				57	4			2710	2730		10.1007/s10853-021-06844-8		JAN 2022		JAN 2022	2022	Nanostructured Ferritic Alloys (NFAs) are candidate materials for use as cladding inside future nuclear reactors. The high number density of nano-sized (< 2 nm diameter) oxide particles are critical to the NFA's advantageous material properties against irradiation. A Kinetic Monte Carlo (KMC) model was developed to simulate the precipitation of yttrium-oxygen (Y-O) and yttrium-titanium-oxygen (Y-Ti-O) nano-oxides, and was parameterized to the solubility data of each element and compound in iron (Fe). The precipitation simulations were found to be closely aligned with the experimental findings of size, number density, and composition of nano-oxides. The equilibrium shape of the oxide precipitates from this parametrization was investigated and followed expectations from the literature. Raising the heat treatment temperature produced larger oxides in all cases. The presence of Ti in the Fe-Y-Ti-O system was found to produce finer oxides than the Fe-Y-O system. All systems exhibited strong resistance to coarsening. The time dependence of coarsening was found to be much lower than that proposed in the Lifshitz-Slyozov-Wagner (LSW) theory. The source of the coarsening resistance in the KMC is from vacancy binding with the interfaces and the low thermodynamic push for coarsening.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0022-2461	1573-4803		WOS:000743012000001

Recently, fluidic jet-in-cross flow (JICF) has been demonstrated experimentally and numerically that can accelerate the deflagration-to-detonation transition (DDT) process. Nonetheless, most of previous studies focused on the jets using combustible mixture or oxygen, which may bring additional risk for turbulence-generated system in detonation engines. In this study, a more safe and controllable inert gas (i.e., Ar) is applied for JICF, experiments are carried out to investigate effects of argon jet as an enhancement method on promoting the DDT in a stoichiometric methane-oxygen mixture. The effects of local argon concentration, turbulence intensity and injection position on the DDT process are systematically examined. Two-dimensional numerical simulations are also performed to elucidate the details of the injection evolution. The experimental results show that turbulence generated by the argon injection can promote flame acceleration and the onset of detonation only in the fast deflagration regime. The enhancing effect is more prominent at higher turbulence intensity by increasing jet injection pressure and shorter injection time. Too long injection duration increases argon local concentration that leads to an adverse effect prohibiting the DDT occurrence. During the initial laminar flame acceleration, referred to as the slow deflagration regime, no enhancement by the argon jet on DDT can be observed. By looking numerically at the flow structure of the argon jet, the vortical features enhance the transport and mixing between reactants and products. The interaction between the reactive travelling wave and the jet structure further induces turbulence and thus accelerates the chemical reaction rate. With the time elapsed, the injected argon entrains largely and dilutes the ambient combustible mixture, and restrains the DDT. Furthermore, a novel dimensionless criterion and a characteristic parameter Turc are proposed, quantitatively analyzing the dominate mechanism in flame propagation and the initial stage of DDT as inert jet is introduced.									14	0	0	0	0	0	14			0016-2361	1873-7153		WOS:000588132400175

Despite the fact D. salina cell was accustomed to the salt environment, extreme high salinity threatened cell by releasing reactive oxygen species, which raise relative electrical conductivity. With the purpose of surviving, D. salina saved plenty of glycerol to prevent the harm of high salinity. To find out the molecular basis for salinity tolerance, transcriptome sequencing was used to identify salt-regulated genes in D. salina. A total of 40,682 unigenes were identified and annotated based on the multiple databases analysis. We found out that about 717-1012 unigenes are up- or downregulated in hypersaline compared to hyposaline condition. The results of research showed that salinity stress upregulated key genes in photosynthesis and glycerol metabolism, this research is the largest comparative investigation of transcriptome D. salina adapted to very salinity environment, creating a solid base for analyzing the molecular mechanism of salt tolerance of algae and higher plants.									3	0	0	0	3	0	3			0735-9640	1572-9818		WOS:000492550500001

In particular, the ultrathin Co3O4 layers have a maximum contact area on the conductive support, facilitating the rapid electron transport and preventing the aggregation of ultrathin layers. The ultrathin feature of Co3O4 layers is characterized by the transmission electron microscopy, Raman spectra, and X-ray absorption fine structure spectroscopy. Benefiting from the high utilization degree of active materials and rapid charge transport, the mass activity for oxygen reduction and evolution reactions of the ultrathin Co3O4/CC electrode is more than 10 times higher than that of the carbon cloth loaded with commercial Co3O4 nanoparticles. Compared to the commercial Co3O4/CC electrode, the flexible Zn-air battery using ultrathin Co3O4/CC electrode exhibits excellent rechargeable performance and high mechanical stability. Furthermore, the flexible Zn-air battery is integrated with a flexible display unit. The whole integrated device can operate without obvious performance degradation under serious deformation and even during the cutting process, which makes it highly promising for wearable and roll-up optoelectronics.									266	17	0	0	8	0	270			1614-6832	1614-6840		WOS:000411182500005

To maximize the current flow through the electrolyte the ohmic drop in the cell was minimized by shortening the electrode distance. The acquired current was then interpreted by means of an ohmic drop correction, taking into account the conductivity of the alumina-silicate electrolyte and the geometrical form factor of the cell. Via this methodology, a mass transfer limitation in dependence of the iron oxide concentration was identified. This mass transfer limitation vanishes above 7 wt pct of iron oxide where charge transfer starts to be limited solely by electrochemical reaction kinetics. In the analyzed range of concentration, an impact of iron oxide on electronic conduction was not measurable. In addition to these findings, the faradaic yield of the anode half-reaction was determined by the life-measure of O-2-production. Hereby, a domain of an anodic yield close to 100 pct for various iron oxide concentrations was identified. Based on these findings, suitable conditions for the electrochemical production of liquid iron were determined.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			1073-5615	1543-1916		WOS:000511881200035

Nanoparticles were fabricated by thermal annealing and oxidizing a Ni thin film deposited on an n-GaN substrate. The performance of water splitting was investigated by varying Ni film thickness and oxidation time, which led to different nanoparticle distribution and NiOx thickness in the core-shell structure. Nano particles fabricated from a thinner Ni film led to a smaller particle-to-particle spacing. It allowed holes in n-GaN to diffuse to nanoparticle catalysts in a shorter distance for water splitting reaction, thereby providing higher photocurrent and better protection against oxidation corrosion. Ni/NiOx core-sell nanoparticles obtained from partial oxidation showed higher photocurrent than sole Ni or fully oxidized NiOx nanoparticles. It is attributed to the optimization between having more NiOx for reaction centers and keeping NiOx thin for easy hole transport from n-GaN across NiOx to NiOx/electrolyte interface for reaction.

Herein, we report that templated chromium nitride porous microspheres built up by nanocubes (NCs) are an efficient noble-metal-free electrocatalyst for NRR. The CrN NCs catalyst exhibits both a high stability and NH(3)yield of 31.11 mu g h(-1)mg(cat.)(-1)with a Faradaic efficiency (FE) of 16.6% in 0.1 M HCl electrolyte. Complementary physical characterization techniques demonstrate partial oxidation of the pristine CrN NCs during reaction. Structural characterization by means of scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) combining electron energy loss spectrum (EELS) and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) analysis reveals the NC structure to consist of an O-rich core and N-rich shell after NRR. This gradient distribution of nitrogen within the CrN NCs upon completed NRR is distinct to previously reported metal nitride NRR catalysts, because no significant loss of nitrogen occurs at the catalyst surface.									15	0	0	0	0	0	15			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000574599500023	32935697

However, it remains a huge challenge to introduce planar defects during the synthesis of metallic catalysts. In this work, we have reported an effective approach for the preparation of Pt nanowires with high-density planar defects. The success of the approach mainly relies on the attaching and merging of small Pt nanoparticles at low temperatures with the assistance of H-2. By comparing the catalytic activities of Pt nanowires with high-density planar defects and commercial Pt/C catalysts toward methanol oxidation reactions, we show that the existence of planar defects can markedly enhance the electrocatalytic performance of the Pt nanowires. The Pt nanowires of 2.0 nm in diameter show a factor of 6.1 enhancement in specific activity and a factor of 5.4 enhancement in mass activity, respectively, for this reaction, compared to the commercial Pt/C catalyst. The method developed in this work could be an effective route to introduce planar defects within Pt catalysts, endowing them with much enhanced catalytic properties.									13	2	0	0	1	0	14			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000484297400032	31355830

In this work, a series of TMS wrapped by a thin carbon layer with enhanced conductivity have been developed by a facile and rapid strategy. Among them, the prepared CoSx compound exhibits the optimal ORR and OER performances because of the synergistic effect between the high intrinsic activity of CoSx and the desirable conductivity of carbon layer. More importantly, the CoSx-based zinc-air batteries (ZABs) exhibit a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) with voltage gap of 0.8 V and remarkable cycling durability, which is comparable to those of the state-of-art noble Pt/C+IrO2 batteries. Therefore, this work introduces a facile route that opens up a new horizon and inspiration for the development of sulfide for energy conversion.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			2196-0216			WOS:000700166000016

The superoxide generated by this enzyme has been suggested as a key actor in the induction of allergic inflammation. However, this enzyme has been characterized in Arabidopsis thaliana pollen only, where two pollen-specific genes (RbohH and RbohJ) have been described. The olive (Olea europaea L.) pollen is an important source of allergy in Mediterranean countries. We have assembled and annotated an olive pollen transcriptome, which allowed us to determine the presence of at least two pollen-specific NADPH oxidase homologues. Primers were designed to distinguish between the two homologues, and full-length sequences were obtained through a PCR strategy. Complete in silico analysis of such sequences, including phylogeny, 3-D modeling of the N-terminus, and prediction of cellular localization and post-translational modifications was carried out with the purpose of shed light into the involvement of olive pollen-intrinsic NADPH oxidases in triggering allergy symptoms.					3rd International Work-Conference on Bioinformatics and Biomedical Engineering (IWBBIO)3rd International Work-Conference on Bioinformatics and Biomedical Engineering (IWBBIO)	APR 15-17, 2015APR 15-17, 2015	Univ Granada, CITIC; BioMed Cent; E Hlth Business Dev BULL S A; Univ Granada, Fac Sci, Dept Comp Architecture & Comp TechnolUniv Granada, CITIC; BioMed Cent; E Hlth Business Dev BULL S A; Univ Granada, Fac Sci, Dept Comp Architecture & Comp Technol	Grenada, SPAINGrenada, SPAIN	1	0	0	0	1	0	1			0302-9743	1611-3349	978-3-319-16483-0; 978-3-319-16482-3	WOS:000410783200044

Large-area single-crystalline 2D TMC sheets are generally prepared by exfoliating MXene sheets from MAX phases. Here, a versatile bottom-up method is reported for preparing ultrathin TMC sheets (approximate to 10 nm in thickness and >100 m in lateral size) with metal nanoparticle decoration. A gelatin hydrogel is employed as a scaffold to coordinate metal ions (Mo5+, W6+, Co2+), resulting in ultrathin-film morphologies of diverse TMC sheets. Carbonization of the scaffold at 600 degrees C presents a facile route to the corresponding MoCx, WCx, CoCx, and to metal-rich hybrids (Mo2-xWxC and W/Mo2C-Co). Among these materials, the Mo2C-Co hybrid provides excellent hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) efficiency (Tafel slope of 39 mV dec(-1) and 48 mVj = 10 mA cm-2 in overpotential in 0.5 m H2SO4). Such performance makes Mo2C-Co a viable noble-metal-free catalyst for the HER, and is competitive with the standard platinum on carbon support. This template-assisted, self-assembling, scalable, and low-cost manufacturing process presents a new tactic to construct low-dimensional TMCs with applications in various clean-energy-related fields.									78	11	0	0	5	0	79			0935-9648	1521-4095		WOS:000453381700021	30368944

The atomic oxygen is chemisorbed in the presence of catalyst by forming GeO2. The evolution of the Germanium dioxide from Germanium and microbes-induced phase transitions in GeO2 is studied by the means of X-ray diffraction method and Raman spectroscopy. The formation of GeO2 from Germanium is also prone to surface oxidation which may compromise surface sensitive measurements. The X-ray diffraction method is not sensitive to anharmonicity-induced dynamical effects due to which there would be a lack of clarity about the phases and transitions intervening in the phase transition of GeO2. The detection of phase transition of GeO2 was being studied by broadening and shifts of diffraction angle in X-ray diffraction. Raman scattering establish the microbial induced phase transitions and identify phases of germanium oxide. The detection of phase transition was being studied by substantial broadening and softening of Raman modes as to identify the transition regions and possible intermediate phases.

The search for suitable semiconductors as photocatalysts for water splitting into molecular hydrogen and oxygen has been considered to be an urgent subject for our daily life. In this review, we aim to focus on the research efforts that have been made so far for H-2 generation from water splitting by UV and visible light-driven photocatalysis. A number of synthetic modification methods for adapting the electronic structure to enhance the charge separation in the photocatalyst materials are discussed. Sacrificial reagents and electron mediators for the overall water splitting are also reviewed. The quantum efficiency of photocatalyst materials upon visible and UV illumination will be reviewed, summarized and discussed. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

The strategy is simple without any post-processing and various heteroatoms could be involved. Scanning electron microscopy, Raman spectra, Nitrogen gas adsorption-desorption, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy have been used to characterize the morphology, the structure and the composition of the materials. The multiple heteroatom doped porous carbon materials also display high electrocatalytic performance as exampled by the application in oxygen reduction, which showed the catalyst favors 4-electron transfer during the process, along with superior stability and higher tolerance to methanol as compared to the Pt/C. These results indicate the present method is promising for the preparation of multi-heteroatom doped carbon materials in the application of electrocatalysis.									49	1	0	0	2	0	50			2045-2322			WOS:000427013600001	29523847

J	Liu, Jiangyong; Meng, Ru; Li, Jinxing; Jian, Panming; Wang, Lixia; Jian, Ruiqi								Achieving high-performance for catalytic epoxidation of styrene with uniform magnetically separable CoFe2O4 nanoparticles								APPLIED CATALYSIS B-ENVIRONMENTAL				254				214	222		10.1016/j.apcatb.2019.04.083				OCT 5 2019	2019	Developing catalysts with unique compositional and structural characteristics, high cost-efficiency, and preferable catalytic performance are still an ongoing task for the selective oxidation of alkenes. Herein, we report the facile construction of uniform magnetically separable CoFe2O4 nanoparticles, which can function as an efficient and robust catalyst for the selective epoxidation of styrene with tert-butyl hydroperoxide as the oxidant. This bimetallic catalyst significantly outperformed its monometallic counterparts with respect to Co3O4 flakes and Fe2O3 rods both in terms of total activity and epoxide production. In the presence of CoFe2O4 nanoparticles as the catalyst, the yield of styrene oxide (SO) can achieve 79.7% with a total styrene conversion of 96.4% and a selectivity of 82.7% to SO under the optimal reaction condition. In addition, the activation energy was measured, and a plausible reaction mechanism was proposed. The outstanding catalytic performance of the CoFe2O4 catalyst can be ascribed to the synergistic effects regarding the abundant surface metal redox couples induced by the bimetallic nature and the mesoporous structure with high surface area.									81	3	0	0	14	0	81			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000472697500022		
J	Vannoni, Lorenzo; Pizzimenti, Silvia; Caroti, Giulia; La Nasa, Jacopo; Duce, Celia; Bonaduce, Ilaria					Pizzimenti, Silvia/0000-0002-6230-5681			Disclosing the chemistry of oil curing by mass spectrometry using methyl linoleate as a model binder								MICROCHEMICAL JOURNAL				173						107012	10.1016/j.microc.2021.107012		NOV 2021		FEB 2022	2022	The structure of the polymeric fraction in an oil painting is believed to be strongly connected to the stability of the paint layers over time, but its molecular characterisation is extremely difficult given the complex composition of a vegetable oil-based polymer. In this study we report the implementation of a methodological approach for the systematic mass spectrometric investigation of the molecular features of the products of oxidative degradation and cross-linking of oil paint layers upon curing. The approach is based on the use of methyl linoleate as a simplified model of an oil paint binder. Gas-chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry, solid phase microextraction gas chromatography mass spectrometry, flow injection electrospray mass spectrometry and evolved gas analysis mass spectrometry, are used to analyse the evolution of compounds produced over seven months of natural ageing, from the volatile products to the macromolecular and cross-linked fractions. The aim is to improve our fundamental molecular understanding of the curing process of oil paints, and to investigate the balance between oxidative degradation and cross-linking when specific binder-pigment combinations are in place. Model paint layers were prepared using lead white and ultramarine blue as pigments. These two pigments are known to produce paint layers with different stability over time. The use of methyl linoleate as model oil binder greatly simplifies the mass spectral features of the lipid paint fraction, enabling the detection of products of oxidation and cross-linking with a new high level of molecular detail. Data clearly show that crucial differences between paints containing the two pigments establish with time, which are mostly related to the cross-linked fraction.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0026-265X	1095-9149		WOS:000736673600002

The experiments were conducted in three 2.4L sequencing batch reactors (SBRs) that were seeded with activated sludge and fed with glucose-based synthetic wastewater. Three different influent organic concentrations were introduced into the three SBRs, R1, R2 and R3, resulting in chemical oxygen demand (COD) loading rates of 1.5 (R1), 3.0 (R2) and 4.5 (R3)kg/m(3) d, respectively. Changes in bacterial diversity throughout the granulation process were monitored and analysed using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) techniques. The experimental results demonstrate that glucose-fed aerobic granules could be formed without significant presence of filamentous bacteria. Granules formed at different loading rates had different morphology, structural properties and bacterial species. A higher loading rate resulted in faster formation of larger and loose granules, while a lower loading rate resulted in slower formation of smaller and more tightly packed granules. The biomass underwent a dynamic transformation in terms of bacterial species richness and dominance during the granulation process. The reactor with the highest substrate loading rate had the lowest species diversity, while the reactor with the lowest substrate loading rate had the highest species diversity. Different dominant species of beta- and gamma-Proteobacteria and Flauobacterium within the granule communities from the three different SBRs were confirmed by analysis of 16S rDNA sequences of the PCR products separated by DGGE. It is apparent that a few common bacterial species play an important role in the formation and growth of aerobic granules and help sustain the granular sludge structure in the bioreactors.

They have unique systems for eliminating reactive oxygen species (ROS). Superoxide dismutase (SOD) is a key enzyme that plays a primary role in removing ROS. Bombyx mori is a lepidopteran insect, whose body size is larger than the model insect Drosophila melanogaster, which enabled us to more easily examine gene expression at the tissue level. We searched B. mori SOD (BmSOD) genes using genome database, and we analyzed their function under different type of oxidative stress. Consequently, we identified four new types of BmSODs in addition to the three types already known. Two of the seven types had a unique domain architecture that has not been discovered previously in the SOD family, and they were expressed in different tissues and developmental stages. Furthermore, these BmSODs responded differently to several kinds of stressors. Our results showed that the seven types of BmSODs are likely to play different roles in B. mori; therefore, B. mori could be used to distinguish the functions of each SOD for resistance to oxidative stress that changes with the environmental conditions.									21	0	0	0	21	0	22			2045-2322			WOS:000458861700003	30778096	
J	Egli, Martin								Architecture and mechanism of the central gear in an ancient molecular timer								JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY INTERFACE				14	128					20161065	10.1098/rsif.2016.1065				MAR 1 2017	2017	Molecular clocks are the product of natural selection in organisms from bacteria to human and their appearance early in evolution such as in the prokaryotic cyanobacterium Synechococcus elongatus suggests that these timers served a crucial role in genetic fitness. Thus, a clock allows cyanobacteria relying on photosynthesis and nitrogen fixation to temporally space the two processes and avoid exposure of nitrogenase carrying out fixation to high levels of oxygen produced during photosynthesis. Fascinating properties of molecular clocks are the long time constant, their precision and temperature compensation. Although these are hallmarks of all circadian oscillators, the actual cogs and gears that control clocks vary widely between organisms, indicating that circadian timers evolved convergently multiple times, owing to the selective pressure of an environment with a daily light/dark cycle. In S. elongatus, the three proteins KaiA, KaiB and KaiC in the presence of ATP constitute a so-called post-translational oscillator (PTO). The KaiABC PTO can be reconstituted in an Eppendorf tube and keeps time in a temperature-compensated manner. The ease by which the KaiABC clock can be studied in vitro has made it the best-investigated molecular clock system. Over the last decade, structures of all three Kai proteins and some of their complexes have emerged and mechanistic aspects have been analysed in considerable detail. This review focuses on the central gear of the S. elongatus clock and only enzyme among the three proteins: KaiC. Our determination of the three-dimensional structure of KaiC early in the quest for a better understanding of the inner workings of the cyanobacterial timer revealed its unusual architecture and conformational differences and unique features of the two RecA-like domains constituting KaiC. The structure also pinpointed phosphorylation sites and differential interactions with ATP molecules at subunit interfaces, and helped guide experiments to ferret out mechanistic aspects of the ATPase, auto-phosphorylation and auto-dephosphorylation reactions catalysed by the homo-hexamer. Comparisons between the structure of KaiC and those of nanomachines such as F1-ATPase and CaMKII also exposed shared architectural features (KaiC/ATPase), mechanistic principles (KaiC/CaMKII) and phenomena, such as subunit exchange between hexameric particles critical for function (clock synchronization, KaiABC; memory-storage, CaMKII).									4	1	0	0	3	0	5			1742-5689	1742-5662		WOS:000398964900017	28330987

The use of alkaline electrolytes opens up possibility of utilizing low-cost transition metal catalysts, which are unstable in acidic electrolytes. Herein, we developed a facile and efficient method to prepare carbon-supported nickel nanoparticles of small size (10 nm) at high metal loading (42 +/- 3 wt%) by electrodeposition. The resultant Ni-ED/XC-72 catalyst exhibits remarkably high mass activity in the hydrogen oxidation reaction, which can be further enhanced by partial oxidation of the metal surface. The activity achieved amounts to ca. 22 A center dot g(Ni)(-1) , thus being comparable to the values reported for commercial 20% Pd/C catalyst (38 A center dot g(pd)(-1)). The excellent electrocatalytic performance indicates that the Ni-ED/XC-72 catalyst can be considered as a replacement of the precious metals at the anodes of AMFCs.									52	1	0	0	2	0	52			0378-7753	1873-2755		WOS:000449447800053

Light absorption by PSII leads to the production of excited states and reactive oxygen species that can cause damage to this complex. Here, we describe Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) At1g71500, which encodes a previously uncharacterized protein that is a PSII auxiliary core protein and hence is named PHOTOSYSTEM II PROTEIN33 (PSB33). We present evidence that PSB33 functions in the maintenance of PSII-light-harvesting complex II (LHCII) supercomplex organization. PSB33 encodes a protein with a chloroplast transit peptide and one transmembrane segment. In silico analysis of PSB33 revealed a light-harvesting complex-binding motif within the transmembrane segment and a large surface-exposed head domain. Biochemical analysis of PSII complexes further indicates that PSB33 is an integral membrane protein located in the vicinity of LHCII and the PSII CP43 reaction center protein. Phenotypic characterization of mutants lacking PSB33 revealed reduced amounts of PSII-LHCII supercomplexes, very low state transition, and a lower capacity for nonphotochemical quenching, leading to increased photosensitivity in the mutant plants under light stress. Taken together, these results suggest a role for PSB33 in regulating and optimizing photosynthesis in response to changing light levels.									36	2	0	0	32	0	36			0032-0889	1532-2548		WOS:000348652700014	25511433

This synthesis employed Au@Ag core-shell nanoparticles as a hard-template to obtain Au@AgPt Y-SNPs by a galvanic replacement reaction between PtCl62- and Ag. Brij-58 surfactant micelles served as a soft-template to prepare dendritic and porous shell. The thus-synthesized Au@AgPt Y-SNPs exhibited enhanced catalytic performance (889 mA mgpt(-1)) and stability for methanol oxidation reaction (MOR) at room temperature, which is 5 times as high as the commercial Pt/C (20 wt% Pt). The enhanced electrocatalytic activity is attributed to following aspects: electronic effect between Pt and Au, synergism between Pt and Ag, and nanoreactor confinement effect in the cavity between the Au core and the shell. The present work provides a simple strategy for the formation of ternary metallic Y-SNPs, which exhibit promising applications in electrocatalysis, energy conversion and sensing.

In this work, we developed a simple but effective manganese-metal-heteroatom doping strategy to realize the simultaneous modulations of the active site number, water dissociation, and hydrogen adsorption free energy in pyrite NiS2 hierarchical nanosheets to significantly boost alkaline and neutral HER catalysis. Specifically, the incorporation of Mn heteroatoms into the NiS2 system, as revealed by HRTEM, XPS, XANES spectra and theoretical studies, not only induce lattice distortions and defects for increasing the exposure of active sites, but also effectively optimize the electronic structure configuration of Ni sites, leading to optimal hydrogen adsorption free energy. In addition, the doped Mn heteroatom itself can act as a water-activated site to lower the energy barrier of water dissociation. As a result, the synergistic regulation of active sites and HER kinetics brings nearly 9-fold enhancement of alkaline HER activity for Mn-doped NiS2/Ni foam (NF) with a quite low overpotential of 71 mV to reach 10 mA cm(-2) in 1 M KOH, which is among the most active HER electrocatalysts reported to date. Despite few reports about the effective neutral HER on transition-metal sulfides so far, a small overpotential of 84 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) can be achieved in 1 M phosphate-buffered saline (PBS, pH 7). Furthermore, the Mn-doped NiS2/NF electrode also exhibits efficient and stable HER performances in near-neutral real seawater and has no obvious catalytic degradation after various extreme bending tests, verifying its high flexibility and robustness under severe conditions, which vastly broadens its application prospects.									46	1	0	0	3	0	45			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000498556500041

Constraining the timing of the Great Oxidation Event within the Rubisco phylogenetic tree								GEOBIOLOGY				15	5			628	640		10.1111/gbi.12243				SEP 2017	2017	Ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate (RuBP) carboxylase/oxygenase (RuBisCO, or Rubisco) catalyzes a key reaction by which inorganic carbon is converted into organic carbon in the metabolism of many aerobic and anaerobic organisms. Across the broader Rubisco protein family, homologs exhibit diverse biochemical characteristics and metabolic functions, but the evolutionary origins of this diversity are unclear. Evidence of the timing of Rubisco family emergence and diversification of its different forms has been obscured by a meager paleontological record of early Earth biota, their subcellular physiology and metabolic components. Here, we use computational models to reconstruct a Rubisco family phylogenetic tree, ancestral amino acid sequences at branching points on the tree, and protein structures for several key ancestors. Analysis of historic substitutions with respect to their structural locations shows that there were distinct periods of amino acid substitution enrichment above background levels near and within its oxygen-sensitive active site and subunit interfaces over the divergence between Form III (associated with anoxia) and Form I (associated with oxia) groups in its evolutionary history. One possible interpretation is that these periods of substitutional enrichment are coincident with oxidative stress exerted by the rise of oxygenic photosynthesis in the Precambrian era. Our interpretation implies that the periods of Rubisco substitutional enrichment inferred near the transition from anaerobic Form III to aerobic Form I ancestral sequences predate the acquisition of Rubisco by fully derived cyanobacterial (i.e., dual photosystem-bearing, oxygen-evolving) clades. The partitioning of extant lineages at high clade levels within our Rubisco phylogeny indicates that horizontal transfer of Rubisco is a relatively infrequent event. Therefore, it is possible that the mutational enrichment periods between the Form III and Form I common ancestral sequences correspond to the adaptation of key oxygen-sensitive components of Rubisco prior to, or coincident with, the Great Oxidation Event.									23	0	0	0	17	0	23			1472-4677	1472-4669		WOS:000407944000002	28670785	
J	Yu, Shan; Miettinen, Jyrki; Louhenkilpi, Seppo								Modeling Study of Nitrogen Removal from the Vacuum Tank Degasser								STEEL RESEARCH INTERNATIONAL				85	9	SI		1393	1402		10.1002/srin.201300262				SEP 2014	2014	Low nitrogen content in liquid steel is required for most of the steelmaking companies, where vacuum degassing of liquid steel is usually carried out to remove nitrogen as well as other impurity elements during ladle treatment. This paper presents an integrated computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model for simulating the nitrogen removal in an industrial vacuum tank degasser (VTD). In the CFD model, oxygen and sulfur are considered as surface-active elements decreasing the denitrogenation rate at the gas-steel interface. An activity coefficient and a desulfurization sub-model are implemented to compute the effective activity coefficients of the related elements and the evolution of sulfur content in liquid steel during the process, respectively. The effect of various elements on denitrogenation rate in the VTD is studied with the developed model. For the used steel compositions the denitrogenation rate decreases with an increase in the content of [S], [O], [Cr], [Nb], [V], [Ti], or [Mn], whereas it increases with an increase in the content of [C], [Si], [P], [Ni], or [Al]. The model is validated by comparing final nitrogen contents measured from the industrial plant with the ones predicted by the model and good agreements were found. The model has proven to be a useful and accurate tool for predicting final nitrogen content of liquid steel in the plant.									10	1	0	0	0	0	11			1611-3683	1869-344X		WOS:000341723500011

Pure alpha-MnO2 nanostructures with different morphologies, including nanowires, nanorods and nanoparticles, were obtained by simply tuning the precipitation conditions. The evolution of materials derived from different preparation conditions was investigated via X-ray diffraction, transmission electron microscopy, N-2 adsorption, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, chemisorption and DFT calculations. The precipitation temperature and time significantly influenced the physiochemical properties of as-prepared catalysts. With increasing precipitation temperature and time, the degree of crystallinity, BET surface area and amount of surface-adsorbed oxygen of alpha-MnO2 exhibited a substantial increase. The main exposed surface facets varied from (2 0 0), (3 1 0) to (2 1 1) as temperature and time increased. The best precipitation temperature and time were 90 degrees C and 24 h respectively. The optimal alpha-MnO2 catalyst demonstrated 100% conversion of 1000 ppm ethyl acetate under the high space velocity of 78,000 h(-1) during a 113-h test at 190 degrees C, outperforming other manganese oxide catalysts and many typical noble metal catalysts in terms of activity and stability. Experimental results and DFT calculations were consistent and indicated that surface oxygen species originating from the (2 1 1) surface of alpha-MnO2 were most active. This study provides important insights for manipulating the morphology of MnO2 by a facile method and remarkably promoting the performance for ethyl acetate VOC elimination.									8	1	0	0	2	0	9			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000653229500239

Herein, a novel 2D heterostructure named CeO2@NiFe-MOFs, in which monolayer NiFe-MOFs is coordinated with ceria (CeO2) to improve catalytic and stability performance, is successfully constructed by the strategy of in situ growth on the surface of ultrathin CeO2 nanosheets being functionalized with monolayer carboxylic acid groups. The 2D heterostructure possesses a sandwich structure, where monolayer NiFe-MOFs are coordinated to both the top and bottom surface of CeO2 nanosheets via joining carboxylic acid groups. In particular, CeO2 with robust coordination plays a significant role in the anchoring of carboxylic acid groups and binding strength of heterostructures. The 2D CeO2@NiFe-MOF heterostructure with a joint effect of metal-ligand coordination not only presents good structural stability but also significantly enhances the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) efficiencies in comparison to bare NiFe-MOFs, achieving a current density of 20 mA cm(-2) at a low overpotential of 248 mV as well as durability for at least 40 h. Meanwhile, the electronics, optics, band gap energy and local strains of CeO2 decorated with 2D NiFe-MOFs are different to the properties of bare CeO2. Our study on the construction of an ultrathin CeO2 surface-coordinated and confined MOF layer may pave a new way for novel 2D MOF composites/heterostructures or multi-functional 2D CeO2 materials to be used in energy conversion or other fields.									10	0	0	0	0	0	10			2041-6520	2041-6539		WOS:000759693300001	35382466

The physical properties of ZnO that had a major influence in the H-2 production were high surface area and low particle size. Furthermore, the effect of the oxygen vacancies in H-2 production was evaluated through the analysis of the ratio of the intensities of the (0 0 2) and (1 0 0) planes, and it was observed that when this ratio was higher than 1, a low photocatalytic activity was obtained. This fact was evidenced by the analysis of HRTEM images, which showed that ZnO sample with the highest H-2 production presented a higher amount of (1 0 0) crystal planes and a lower amount of (0 0 2), which confirms the relation observed by XRD. A lower amount of (0 0 2) planes was related to a higher amount of oxygen vacancies on ZnO surface. Thus, when ZnO was used as a photocatalyst in H-2 production, the presence of oxygen vacancies in its surface had a detrimental effect in the activity due to the photocorrosion phenomenon in ZnO. The highest photocatalytic hydrogen production was 107 mu mol g(-1) h(-1). The solar-to-hydrogen efficiencies obtained were higher (0.65%) than the reported values for ZnO and other simple oxides in these applications.									27	1	0	0	0	0	27			0921-5107	1873-4944		WOS:000414880700029

In the present work, a general operable synthetic platform for stable and well-defined positioned single-atom metal catalysts encapsulated in metal-organic framework (MOF) architecture was developed. Using the MOF-808 based single ion trap method, single metal ions were effectively captured by ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) ligands, which were exchanged with the original formate ligands anchored at the Zr-6 cluster metal nodes. Upon activated in hydrogen atmosphere at 200 degrees C, the stable MOF-808-EDTA encapsulated single-atom metal catalysts with well-defined atomic positions were synthesized. The synthesized single-atom metal catalysts were confirmed using various experimental characterization techniques including high-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscope, extended X-ray absorption fine structure spectroscopy analysis, and diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform, as well as theoretical density functional theory calculations. As a demonstration case, it has been found that the as-synthesized MOF-808-EDTA encapsulated single-atom Pt catalyst shows the excellent photocatalytic hydrogen evolution activity (68.33 mmol g(-1) h(-1)) and high stability. The apparent quantum efficiency reaches up to 67.6% at 420 nm. This work not only provides a general and effective synthesis approach for preparing stable, uniformly distributed, MOF encapsulated single-atom metal catalysts such as Pd, Rh, Ru, Cu, Co, and Ni, but also sheds new insights into single-atom metal catalysts for photocatalytic water splitting for hydrogen production.

In this process, a neutral radical of Y-Z tyrosine plays a role in oxidizing Mn2+ associated with an apo-OEC, and also in abstracting a proton from a water molecule bound to the Mn2+ ion, together with D1-His190. This is in a similar fashion to the metallo-radical mechanism proposed for photosynthetic water oxidation by the (Mn)(4)-cluster. The model insists that a common mechanism participates in the photoassembly of the (Mn)4-cluster and the photosynthetic water oxidation. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

Effect of incoming solar particle radiations on the exosphere of mars [arXiv]								arXiv								11 pp.	11 pp.						23 Aug. 2020	2020	Mars Exospheric Neutral Composition Analyzer (MENCA) of Mars Orbiter Mission (MOM) measures the in-situ neutral upper atmospheric constituents of Mars. Martian lower atmosphere predominated by the presence of CO2 which photo-dissociates into atomic oxygen (O) in higher altitudes much near the exobase. Atomic O plays a significant role in invoking stronger presence of O2+ in the Martian ionosphere. Primary photo-dissociative species CO2, crossover its neutral abundance with atomic O in the collisonless hetergenous atmosphere with varying local solar conditions. Initial measurements from Neutral Gas and Ion Mass Spectrometer (NGIMS) instrument on Mars Atmosphere and Volatile Evolution (MAVEN) estimated these crossover/transition altitude wavering between ap225 km to 240 km during solar maximum conditions with peak solar illuminations. MENCA sampled the neutral atmospheric species, below the exobase upto periareion of ap160 km, under low solar active conditions during June 2018. Observations of partial pressures of CO2 and O in subsequent orbits reveals that solar inputs are crucial in quantifying these crossing points, where [O]/[CO2] remain unity, alongside the influences from temperature. The multi-spacecraft measurements of the direct influences of solar wind charged particle fluxes and velocity on the daily variation of neutral thermospheric/exospheric compositions were observed on the local evening hours of Mars and presented. It marks the first-ever direct in-situ observation of interaction between the energetic solar particle radiations on Martian exospheric compositions, potentially contibuting for the steady escape and differing population of atomic [O] in the exosphere.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0						INSPEC:20029020

The three-subunit core of the enzyme is conserved, whereas several proteins identified to function in the biosynthesis of the common family A1 cytochrome c oxidase show diversity in bacteria. Using the model organisms Bacillus subtilis, Corynebacterium glutamicum, Paracoccus denitrificans, and Rhodobacter sphaeroides, the present review focuses on proteins for assembly of the heme a, heme a(3), Cu-B, and Cu-A metal centers. The known biosynthesis proteins are, in most cases, discovered through the analysis of mutants. All proteins directly involved in cytochrome c oxidase assembly have likely not been identified in any organism. Limitations in the use of mutants to identify and functionally analyze biosynthesis proteins are discussed in the review. Comparative biochemistry helps to determine the role of assembly factors. This information can, for example, explain the cause of some human mitochondrion-based diseases and be used to find targets for new antimicrobial drugs. It also provides information regarding the evolution of aerobic bacteria.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0				2076-2607		WOS:000803489400001	35630371

S doped Cu2O-CuO nanoneedles array: Free standing oxygen evolution electrode with high efficiency and corrosion resistance for seawater splitting								Catalysis Today				400-401				14	25		10.1016/j.cattod.2021.09.015				2022	2022	Electrochemical splitting of seawater is highly preferable over freshwater electrolysis to produce sustainable hydrogen terrifically due to its abundance in nature. Seawater electrolysis is encouraging to produce green hydrogen and safe drinking water. The accomplishment of seawater electrolysis needs robust and cost-effective anode material that should acquire an excellent catalytic activity, durability, and selectivity for OER and have high resistance against Cl- corrosion. Here we report a free-standing anode consisting of partially amorphous sulfur substituted copper oxide (S-Cu2O-CuO) nanoneedles directly grow on Cu foil. Benefiting from high electrical conductivity, plentiful active sites, high intrinsic activity per active site, and fast rate for ionic and electronic transfer, these disorders nanoneedles structured S-Cu2O-CuO demonstrate outstanding OER performance needing an overpotential of 450 mV to attain a high geometric activity (1000 mA cm-2) in 1 M KOH. Its disordered surface structure and amorphous features lead to improved corrosion resistance and durability, making it a prospective anode for direct seawater electrolysis. It requires an overpotential of 420 mV to achieve a geometric activity of 500 mA cm-2 in alkaline seawater and sustain water electrolysis for 100 h without making hypochlorite. Because of the facile, scalable, and economical approach, the catalyst is highly promising for large-scale realistic alkaline seawater electrolysis.

Herein, we report the successful surface phosphorization of a gallium indium zinc oxynitride (GaInZnON) photocatalyst, which comprises a GaInZnON core and a thin InP shell. The success to the synthesis relies on the rapid diffusion of In from the bulk to the crystal surface and preferential combination of In with P to form an outer layer. The enhanced charge migration was confirmed with characterization and the charge redistribution difference around the heterojunction. The core-shell composite having an ideal type-II band alignment enables efficient charge separation within the particle scale and significantly improved photocatalytic activity toward pure water splitting for simultaneous and stoichiometric H-2 and O-2 evolution. The apparent quantum efficiencies can be up to 10.6% at 430 nm and 13.8% at 350 nm, respectively. Our results suggest that such core-shell GaInZnON@InP architectures hold great potential for efficient and scalable solar hydrogen generation.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000626516200006

In the first step, Cu and Nb powders are milled to create a two-phase alloy comprising a Cu-rich matrix containing a high density of 20- to 30-nm Nb precipitates. In the second step, this nanocomposite is co-milled with CuO, resulting in the reduction of CuO and the oxidation of the Nb nanoprecipitates. Transmission electron microscopy characterization shows that three distinct types of Nb oxide precipitates evolve at different levels of strain. First, nanocrystalline NbO particles (similar to 10 nm) are formed by dissolved Nb in Cu reacting with oxygen evolved from the CuO. Next, the Nb nanoprecipitates in Cu further reduce CuO to form Nb/Nb oxide and NbO/Nb oxide core-shell inclusions (20-30 nm). These inclusions coalesce during additional milling to form amorphous Nb oxide agglomerates (>700 nm after 50 h). The growth of Nb precipitates during step-one milling, the initial growth of NbO nanoparticles, and the formation of core-shell Nb oxide precipitates during step-two milling are attributed to the convective transport of atoms and clusters combined with shear-induced agglomeration.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			0884-2914	2044-5326		WOS:000507521800010

TiO2 in the form of nanotubes arrays is the most attractive for practical use because of the morphological advantages providing more favorable diffusion of photocatalytic reaction products and a low recombination rate of photogenerated electrons and holes. We have carried out a comparative study of the photocatalytic activity of gas-phase conversion of CO2 to hydrocarbon products and the defect properties of multi-walled and single-walled arrays of TiO2 nanotubes. Methanol and methane have been detected in the CO2 photoreduction process. The photocatalytic evolution rate of multi-walled TiO2 nanotubes is twice as fast for methane as for single-walled TiO2 nanotubes after four hours of irradiation and four times faster for methanol. The type and features of the structural defects have been investigated by EPR spectroscopy. For the first time, it has been shown that Ti3+/oxygen vacancy centers are mainly located inside the outer layer of nanotubes, while carbon dangling bonds have been observed directly on the surface of the inner layer. Carbon defects have been found to be the centers of adsorption and accumulation of photoinduced charge carriers. The results are entirely new; they clarify the role of different types of defects in the photocatalytic conversion of CO2 to hydrocarbon compounds and show good prospects for applying TiO2 nanotube arrays.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			0957-4484	1361-6528		WOS:000717790100001	34670208

The changes of catalytic properties of Ti/Sb-SnO2 electrodes prepared at different current densities were studied. The surface morphology and catalytic performance of Ti/Sb-SnO2 electrodes were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The oxygen evolution potentials of the electrodes were measured by linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) at the same time. The results show that the increase of the current density can improve the polarization and the electrolysis reaction of water, changing the surface morphology of Ti/Sb-SnO2 electrodes. When the current density increases to 30 mA/cm(2), the porous structure is formed on the electrode surface, which provides more active sites for the Ti/Sb-SnO2 electrode surface and improves the catalytic ability of the electrode greatly. However, when the current density continues to increase, the catalytic ability of the electrode will decrease. This is because the excessively high current density will lead to the loose structure of the electrode surface, which is not conducive to the improvement of the catalytic efficiency of Ti/Sb-SnO2 electrodes.					1st China-New Zealand Forum on Advanced Materials and Processing Technology (AMPT) / 5th International Forum on Advanced Materials and Processing Technoogies1st China-New Zealand Forum on Advanced Materials and Processing Technology (AMPT) / 5th International Forum on Advanced Materials and Processing Technoogies	MAY 28-29, 2021MAY 28-29, 2021	Univ AucklandUniv Auckland	Jiangsu Univ Sci & Technol, Zhenjiang, PEOPLES R CHINAJiangsu Univ Sci & Technol, Zhenjiang, PEOPLES R CHINA	0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0217-9792	1793-6578		WOS:000794808200032

CdS with a suitable bandgap (2.25 eV) and band position was for a long time not considered as a promising candidate for overall solar water splitting because of its serious photo-corrosion and rapid charge recombination, although it has considerable photocatalytic activity for H-2 generation in a sacrificial agent containing electrolyte. Here, we design a new sandwich-like architecture using CdS nanorods embedded in a p-n junction of MoS2/N-RGO which serves as a novel photocatalytic system that could promote overall water splitting in natural water. It was found that the p-n junction of MoS2/N-RGO not only works as the HER and OER electrocatalyst for H-2 and O-2 generation respectively, but also facilitates charge separation by its inner electric field. Compared to well-defined thermodynamically favored charge transport, the new charge transfer route in MoS2/CdS/N-RGO splits natural water, resulting in an essential change of the carrier separation mechanism and high anti-corrosion.									73	5	0	0	6	0	73			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000349997000007

Herein, we propose a facile synchronous reduction strategy to fabricate a yolk-shell Co3O4@Co3O4/Ag hybrid which integrates the advantages of surface, interface, and doping engineering as a highly active catalyst for Li-O-2 batteries. The Co3O4@Co3O4/Ag-based cathode shows a high initial capacity (12000 mAh g(-1)@200 mA g(-1)), high rate capability (4700 mAh g(-1)@800 mA g(-1)), low overpotential, and long cycle life due to the synergetic interactions of surface, interface, and doping engineering. The underling synergetic mechanism has been uncovered by X-ray diffraction, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, X-ray absorption near-edge structure spectra, aberration-corrected scanning transmission electron microscopy, electrochemical impedance spectra, and ex situ scanning electron microscopy. For Co3O4@Co3O4/Ag, part of Ag has formed on the surface of Co3O4 shell as single atoms or clusters and a fraction of Ag has been doped into the crystal lattice of Co3O4 at the same time, which not only strengthens the Ag-Co3O4 interface binding but also tailors the valence electronic structure of Ag and Co species as well as improves the electronic conductivity. This particular architecture provides more active sites for the ORR/OER and also enhances the catalytic activity. In addition, flowerlike Li2O2 forms on the Co3O4@Co3O4/Ag cathode, which is more feasible to decompose in comparison to toroidal-like Li2O2. This study offers some insights into designing efficient cathode catalysts through a synergetic surface/interface/doping engineering strategy.									76	8	0	0	2	0	79			2155-5435			WOS:000426804100041

In cyanobacteria, dark adaptation tends to reduce PQ pool and induce a shift of the cyanobacterial photosynthetic apparatus to State 2, whereas illumination oxidizes PQ pool, leading to State 1 (Mullineaux, C. W., and Holzwarth, A. R. (1990) FEBS Lett., 260, 245-248). We show here that dark-adapted Ox(-) mutant with naturally reduced PQ is characterized by slower Q(A) (-) reoxidation and O-2 evolution rates, as well as lower quantum yield of PSII primary photochemical reactions (F-v/F-m) as compared to the wild type and SDH-mutant, in which the PQ pool remains oxidized in the dark. These results indicate a large portion of photochemically inactive PSII reaction centers in the Ox(-) mutant after dark adaptation. While light adaptation increases F-v/F-m in all tested strains, indicating PSII activation, by far the greatest increase in F-v/F-m and O-2 evolution rates is observed in the Ox(-) mutant. Continuous illumination of Ox(-) mutant cells with low-intensity blue light, that accelerates Q(A) (-) reoxidation, also increases F-v/F-m and PSII functional absorption cross-section (590 nm); this effect is almost absent in the wild type and SDH-mutant. We believe that these changes are caused by the reorganization of the photosynthetic apparatus during transition from State 2 to State 1. We propose that two processes affect the PSII activity during changes of light conditions: 1) reversible inactivation of PSII, which is associated with the reduction of electron carriers on the PSII acceptor side in the dark, and 2) PSII activation under low light related to the increase in functional absorption cross-section at 590 nm.									1	0	0	0	1	0	1			0006-2979	1608-3040		WOS:000382147000006	27677553

Here, we report a significant enhancement of visible light photoactivity in nitrogen-implanted TiO2 (N-TiO2) nanowire array. Our systematic studies show that a post-implantation thermal annealing treatment can selectively enrich the substitutional nitrogen dopants, which is essential for activating the nitrogen implanted TiO2 to achieve greatly enhanced visible light photoactivity. An incident photon to electron conversion efficiency (IPCE) of similar to 10% is achieved at 450 nm in N-TiO2 without any other cocatalyst, far exceeding that in pristine TiO2 nanowires (similar to 0.2%). The integration of oxygen evolution reaction (OER) cocatalyst with N-TiO2 can further increase the IPCE at 450 nm to similar to 17% and deliver an unprecedented overall photocurrent density of 1.9 mA/cm(2), by integrating the IPCE spectrum with standard AM 1.5G solar spectrum. Systematic photoelectrochemical and that the enhanced PEC performance can be attributed to the significantly improved visible light absorption and more efficient charge separation. Our studies demonstrate the implantation approach can be used to reliably dope TiO2 to achieve the best performed N-TiO2 photoelectrodes to date and may be extended to fundamentally modify other semiconductor materials for PEC water splitting.									141	16	0	0	6	0	145			1530-6984	1530-6992		WOS:000357964100068	26052643

In order to overcome the kinetic limitations and achieve rapid charge transfer, TiO2-related multi-component catalysts have been extensively studied. Among all the TiO2 supports, the impressive black TiO2 (BT) with broad visible light absorption spectrum and oxygen vacancies are preferable, but still suffers from low quantum efficiency. Meanwhile, poor control of cocatalyst placement by conventional loading method can also severely impede photocatalytic efficiency. Herein a fast and simple metal magnetron sputter approach was used to place highly-uniformed Au nanoparticles cocatalyst on the top of the mesoporous TiO2-BT nanotube array fabricated by in situ electrochemical anodization approach on a Ti film. This confined plasmonic photocatalyst with highly uniformly distributed Au cocatalysts exhibited greatly enhanced charge-separation and charge-transfer behavior, and a remarkable 10 times enhancement of the photocatalytic H-2 evolution reactivity over conventional TiO2 nanotube. The TiO2-BT-Au electron transfer cascade structure is proposed in which black TiO2 acts as a buffer layer for TiO2 conduction band electrons, allowing efficient photogenerated electrons to be transferred to Au nanoparticles and then into the TiO2 pores that suitable for H-2 generation. Since the nanotube walls themselves are curved upwards, the short diffusion length allows electrons to be easily transferred to the cocatalyst, where recombination of photogenerated electron pairs is limited. The metal magnetron sputter technique for noble metal cocatalyst immobilization and the unique TiO2-BT-Au electron-transfer system are promising and can be extended to the design of other supported catalysts.

EPR and activity measurements demonstrate that, in the absence of the 17 and 23 kDa extrinsic polypeptides, it is nor necessary to use either low pH or Ca chelators to effect complete replacement of the active site Ca2+ by Sr2+, DY3+, or La3+. The extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) spectra for the OEC show evidence for a Mn ... M interaction at ca. 3.3 Angstrom that could arise either from Mn ... Mn scattering within the Mn cluster or Mn ... Ca scattering between the Mn cluster and the inorganic Ca2+ cofactor. There is no significant change in the either the amplitude or the phase of this feature when Ca2+ is replaced by Sr2+ or DY3+, thus demonstrating that there is no EXAFS-detectable Mn ... Ca contribution at ca. 3.3 Angstrom in these samples. The only significant consequence of Ca2+ replacement is a small change in the ca. 2.7 Angstrom Mn ... Mn distance. The average Mn ... Mn distance decreases 0.014 Angstrom when Ca2+ is replaced by Sr2+ and increases 0.012 Angstrom when Ca2+ is replaced by Dy3+. A structural model which can account both for the variation in Mn ... Mn distance and for the known properties of Ca2+-substituted samples is one in which there is a hydrogen bond between a Ca2+-bound water and a Mn-2(mu-O)(2) unit. This scheme suggests that an important role for the Ca2+ may be to modulate the protonation stare, and thus the redox potential, of the Mn cluster.									92	0	0	0	49	0	92			0002-7863			WOS:A1996UA02900012

The quality of superconducting cavity is closely related to the purity of the surface material. In such an aim, carbon and oxygen contaminations at the surface and at the interface of the Nb/Cu device has been measured taking advantage of high cross section plateau observed in the O16(alpha,alpha)16O and C12(alpha,alpha)12C excitation functions at 7.5 and 5.7 MeV respectively. Since the niobium film is deposited on copper by magnetron sputtering under argon atmosphere, argon analysis is performed using the resonance in the nuclear reaction Ar40(rho,gamma)41K at the proton energy of 1102 keV. The sensitivity limit of this non destructive method is less than 0.3 at.%. In order to simulate the energy deposition occurring during particle acceleration, Nb/Cu samples have been irradiated with a 600 keV argon beam from 3times1016 to 2.4times1017 ionstimescm-2. The element distribution evolution is then followed by RBS and NBS. Ion beam mixing effect in the case of samples with oxygen interface contamination (Nb/Nb+Ox+Cu/Cu) is shown to be enhanced. The sputtering yield is shown to be dependent of the surface roughness; but in the case of Nb/Cu devices a low value of sputtering yield is observed which is connected to the surface oxyde.									0	0	0		0	0	0						INSPEC:4076329

Here, Bi2212/Ag round multifilamentary wire is manufactured using a metallic precursor powder-in-tube (MPIT) process. The MP powders were packed into a pure Ag tube in an Ar atmosphere and then sealed. After deformation, multifilamentary round wires and rolled tapes were heat treated in flowing oxygen through three stages: oxidation, conversion and partial-melt processing (PMP). Processing-microstructure-property relationships on 20-50 mm long multifilamentary round wires and rolled tapes were studied extensively. It is shown that conventional wire deformation processes, optimized for oxide-powder-in-tube wires, are not effective for deforming MPIT wires, and that as with prior studies of MPIT Bi2Sr2Ca2Cu3Oy conductors, hot extrusion is required for obtaining a multifilamentary structure with fine filaments. As a result, the Bi2212 MPIT wires reported here have low engineering critical current density. Nonetheless, by focusing on sections of wires that remain intact after deformation, it is also shown that the first heat treatment stage, the oxidation stage, plays a crucial role in chemical homogeneity, phase transformation, and microstructural evolution and three reaction pathways for MP oxidation are presented. Furthermore, it is found the Bi2212 grain alignment within an MPIT filament is significantly different from that found in OPIT filaments after PMP, indicating the formation of highly dense filaments containing Bi2212 fine grains and Ag particles before PMP aids the formation of large, c-axis textured Bi2212 filaments during PMP. These results show that, with improved wire deformation, high critical current density may be obtained via a MPIT process.									49	0	0	0	0	0	49			0953-2048	1361-6668		WOS:000386376200001

The 2007 Marie Curie prize: the linear no threshold relationship and advances in our understanding of carcinogenesis								International Journal of Low Radiation				5	3			173	204		10.1504/IJLR.2008.020249				2008	2008	Better knowledge of carcinogenesis has improved the assessment of the putative carcinogenic effects of low doses of ionising radiation (IR). Cancer induction is a main threat to multicellular organisms and safeguards have been introduced during evolution. Mutations result from endogenous agents, mainly reactive oxygen species (ROS), and exogenous agents. IR and solar ultraviolet (UV) have existed since the onset of life and the existence of some congenital diseases, such as xeroderma pigmentosum (XP), demonstrates that without such defence mechanisms, life would have been impossible. Low doses of IR damage DNA but also activate cell defences: anti-oxidative mechanisms, DNA repair, adaptive responses, elimination of aberrant and preneoplastic cells, and immune reactions. The effectiveness of these defences decreases with the dose and is modulated by several time factors. The cell defence strategy varies with the dose, the irradiated volume and the damage inflicted on neighbouring cells. No cancer induction is detected in humans or animals for acute doses below 100 mSv. In patients treated by fractionated radiotherapy or submitted to iterative X-ray examination, the lowest dose that induces cancer appears to be at about 0.5 Sv, but doses as low as 20 mSv have a cumulative effect. Experimental studies, in vitro or on animals, suggest the existence of a threshold. In the low-dose range (< 100 mSv), epidemiological surveys do not bring any convincing data in favour of a linear no threshold relationship.									16	0	1	0	12	0	19			1477-6545			INSPEC:10576584

Samples were produced with different quenching rates and oxygen contents of the quenching atmosphere. Phase analysis on as cast ribbons and after oxidation and reduction treatment was performed by X-ray diffraction and electron microscopy. It was found that the presence of the metastable crystalline phases and oxides developed in the precursor during the rapid quenching process affects the formation of the phase mixture of metal oxides and fine grained zirconia that determines the catalytic activity of the activated NiZr samples. Formation of the nanoscale-grained tetragonal zirconia and a fine dispersion of Ni, favourable to an increased catalytic activity of the NiZr alloys are enhanced for nanocrystalline and amorphous ribbons produced in vacuum or He atmosphere. For comparison, structural investigation during oxidation and reduction treatment was performed on comminuted embrittled ribbons.

Si is an ideal light absorber used in solar water splitting to produce H-2 gas because of its small band gap, appropriate conduction band position, and high theoretical photocurrent. However, the overpotential required to drive the photo-electrochemical (PEC) hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) on bare Si electrodes is severely high owing to its sluggish kinetics. Herein, a molybdenum tungsten disulfide (MoS2-WS2) composite decorated on a Si photoabsorber is used as a cocatalyst to accelerate HER kinetics and enhance PEC performance. This MoS2-WS2 hybrid showed superior catalytic activity compared with pristine MoS2 or WS2. The optimal MoS2-WS2/Si electrode delivered a photocurrent of -25.9 mA/cm(2) at 0 V (vs reversible hydrogen electrode). X-ray absorption spectroscopy demonstrated that MoS2-WS2 possessed a high hole concentration of unoccupied electronic states in the MoS2 component, which could promote to accept large amounts of carriers from the Si photoabsorber. Moreover, a large number of sulfur vacancies are generated in the MoS(2 )constituent of this hybrid cocatalyst. These sulfur defects served as HER active sites to boost the catalytic efficiency. Besides, the TiO2-protective MoS2-WS2/Si photocathode maintained a current density of -15.0 mA/cm(2) after 16 h of the photocatalytic stability measurement.									13	2	0	0	1	0	14			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000599505200039	33242954

Herein, we restructure the atomic arrangement around nickel active sites via iron-implantation-triggered locality phase restructuring from heazlewoodite Ni3S2 to godlevskite Ni9S8 and cerium substitution effect based on hydrothermal coordination strategy. As revealed, Fe-atom implantation can effectively trigger the phase conversion of heazlewoodite Ni3S2 into godlevskite Ni9S8, and the coexistence of heazlewoodite and godlevskite phases allows crystallographic orientation diversification. Phase interfaces further improve the electronic configuration of nickel active species. Combining this controllable phase restructuring and further Ce substitution strategy, the resultant high-entropy Fe,Ce-NixSy exhibits excellent electrocatalytic activities for water splitting. This study not only throws insight into the crystal phase transition protocol influenced by Fe-atom implantation but also attempts to merge controllable phase reconstruction and Ce substitution process to maximize their electrocatalytic performances for water splitting.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			0378-7753	1873-2755		WOS:000745082200002

It is widely used in submersed nozzle,long nozzle,monolithic Stopper,slide gates and other functional refractories product for flow controlling and steel cleaning,as well as basic oxygen furnaces,electric furnaces,steel ladles and smelting industrial furnace lining. At the same time,as steel metallurgical tend to be more efficient and intelligent,higher requirements are placed on the slag corrosion resistance and thermal shock resistance of carbon-containing refractories. The damage of carbon-containing refractories often starts from the oxidation of graphite. The easily oxidized carbon not only expend flake graphite resources to release greenhouse gases,but also decrease the properties of carbon-containing refractories and curtail the service life. Therefore,the development of oxidation resistance technology of carbon-containing refractories has important significance for improving the quality and efficiency of metallurgy industry and environmental protection. However,the composition of the raw materials of the carbon-containing refractories is complicated,and the performances are mutually restricted during use. While improving theoxidation resistance,other properties of the carbon-containing refractories are reduced. Therefore,in addition to the optimization of the oxidation resistance by adjusting the content and grain size of different antioxidants,researchers have mainly explored the antioxidant composite and the microstructure evolution of carbon-containing refractories,improve slag corrosion resistance and mechanical properties. According to the oxidative damage mechanism of carbon-containing refractories,the addition of antioxidant is still the most commonly used oxidation resistant technology for carbon-containing refractories. In addition to the formation of metal oxides and carbides to prevent the oxidation of carbon-containing refractory materials,metal antioxidants can also improve the mechanical properties and slag corrosion resistance of carbon-containing refractories by solid state reaction. The transition metals and metal alloys. As an antioxidant,it also has catalytic pyrolytic carbon graphitization and promotes the formation of carbide whiskers. In addition to the common silicon carbide and boron carbide,the MAX phase and the complex compounds prepared by Al with carbides not only have excellent oxidation resistance,but also can avoid material cracking by prevent the hydration of metal carbides. Boron-containing oxides can not only form a dense oxide layer to slow the penetration of oxygen,but also make it easier to form magnesia-alumina spinel through ion migration. In addition,nano antioxidants and composite powders antioxidants are easier to disperse in the matrix of carbon-containing refractories to form a even microstructure to improve comprehensive performance. This review summarizes the oxidative damage mechanism of carbon-containing refractories; mainly analyzes the current research status of three types of antioxidants,including metals,carbides and boron-containing oxides,and focuses on the research progress of antioxidants in the reaction mechanism and microstructure evolution.

Unfortunately, Ni-rich cathode materials suffer from low capacity retention and poor thermal stability due to phase transition that results in issues such as the oxygen evolution reaction, hindering its extensive implementation. Herein, highly pliable separators with a 3D porous structure are prepared via a facile phase-inversion method from an inorganic phosphorus-based flame retardant and a thermally conductive graphene oxide additive. Benefiting from its 3D porous structure, in-built radical scavenger, and uniform thermal distribution, the obtained separator enables a near-single Li+ migration (tLi+ = 0.8) by blocking large-size anions, driving the LiNi0.8Mn0.1Co0.1O2/Li metal batteries to 188.8 mAh g(-1) at 0.2 C, and demonstrating a capacity retention of 82.2% versus 41.4% for commercial polyolefin separators after 200 cycles, as well as excellent dendrite-suppressing capabilities by reducing localized temperature hotspots and enabling sufficient mass transfer. This work also suggests a new alternative pathway for stabilizing reactive electrode materials for other high-energy battery systems.									10	0	0	0	0	0	10			1614-6832	1614-6840		WOS:000598315500001

The chemical structures of PG-FA and PG-A were identified by H-1 NMR, C-13 NMR and FTIR tests. The ring-opening polymerization (ROP) behavior of PG-FA and PG-A was monitored by DSC, TGA, FTIR and in situ FTIR measurements. The pyrogallol-containing benzoxazines showed latent catalytic activity as they reached melting condition. The inter- and intramolecular hydrogen bonds from the phenolic hydroxyl and oxygen or nitrogen were converted into weak OH re intramolecular hydrogen bonding, which easily released the free phenolic hydroxyl. Then, the free hydroxyl could accelerate the breakage of oxazine ring. The para-position of free phenolic hydroxyl in pygarollol-based benzoxazines was preferentially polymerized with the carbocations. The temperature-dependent evolution of the chemical structure of PG-FA and PG-A on ROP was consistent with the change of hydrogen bonds.									26	0	0	0	0	0	26			0014-3057	1873-1945		WOS:000433270200018

The initial structure possessed a flat hexagonal morphology made up of crystalline domains with a well-defined hexagonal crystal structure. The Ni-Fe LDHs were susceptible to significant structural decompositions during electron irradiation. The generation of pores and crystallographic breakdown of the LDH routinely occurred. In addition, a compositional change was established by electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS). During 300 kV irradiation, a pre-peak evolution in the oxygen K edge highlighted a transition to metal oxide species. In parallel, nitrogen K edge attenuation demonstrated interlayer mass-losses. It was found that TEM conditions profoundly affected the decomposition behaviours. At lower acceleration voltages, an increased dehydration rate of the LDH cationic layers is observed during irradiaton. Moreover, in situ specimen cooling revealed the retention of interlayer nitrates. An emphasis on the dehydroxylation processes and anionic mass-loss facilitation is discussed.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3				2397-7132		WOS:000627854000002

Under natural conditions, organisms are exposed to more than one stressor at any one time, highlighting the importance of stress resistance traits. We studied how inbreeding-and immunity-related traits are correlated under different dietary conditions in the ant Formica exsecta. Its natural diet varies in the amount and nature of plant secondary compounds and the level of free radicals, all of which require detoxification to maintain organismal homeostasis. We found that inbreeding decreased general antibacterial activity under dietary stress, suggesting inbreeding-related physiological trade-offs.									8	1	0	0	8	0	8			1744-9561	1744-957X		WOS:000345465900020	25392316

The study of filling minerals provides an opportunity for reconstructing the palaeoenvironment and evolution history of the formation of rocks and minerals. For the first pre-selected site of HRW deep disposal repositories in Beishan, Gansu Province, China, Carbon, Oxygen and Rb-Sr isotopes and U-series nuclides from such fillings as calcite and quartz at different depths in granite show that there are four different geochemical environments. (1) In the shallow part (from the surface to a depth of 150 m), delta~(18)O(SM0W) = 12.1-13.0, delta~(13)C(PDB) = -9.5- -10.1 delta~(87)Sr=-3. 24- -1.09, the fillings were formed from low- temperature fluids and meteoric water. (2) In the upper-middle part (150-350 m) , delta~(18)O(SMOW) =13. 3 - 18.0 delta~(87)Sr0, delta~(13)C(PDB) = -11.2- -10.5, the fillings were formed from multi-source fluids, mainly meteoric water and basin brine in a weak reduction environment. The U-series specific radioactivity also implies a relatively stable groundwater environment without influence of fresh water or modern groundwater. (3) In the lower-middle part (350 - 550m): the fillings were formed in a relatively stable environment controlled by groundwater with two different features. ? In the deepest part (below 550 m) , the granite is very homogeneous in geochemistry. The stable and radioactive isotope data show that geochemical reactions between groundwater and granite were in a secular equilibrium condition. This is a good geochemical environment for long-term geologic disposal of HRW.			评价高放射性废物深地质处置库安全性能的一个重要方面是研究处置库的远场地球化学环境；矿物和岩石同位素地球化学研究可以较客观地重现矿物、岩石形成时的古环境及其演化历史。对中国第一个高放射性废物处置库预选场深部花岗岩不同深度裂隙充填矿物（方解石、石英）的C、O同位素，Rb一Sr同位素及铀系核素的研究表明预选场深部花岗岩可分为四种不同的地球化学环境：①浅部（0～150爪），其填隙矿物的BlsO（S MOW）～12.1～13.0，delta13C（PDB）=-9.5--10.1，delta87Sr=-3.24--1.09，填隙矿物形成于低温流体环境，为大气降水补给。②中一上部（150～350m），delta18O（SMOW）＝13.3～18.0，沙87Sr幻o，占13C（PDB）=-11.2--10．5％0，填隙矿物形成时其流体来源较复杂，为大气降水和盆地卤水的混合流体，且处于弱还原环境；铀系核素活度数据也显示此区段地下水环境相对稳定，未受到现代大气降水或地下水的影响。③中一下部花岗岩（350～550m），填隙矿物形成时的环境由两种不同性质的地下水控制，但深部地球化学环境相对稳定。④深部（＞550m），岩性相对稳定，地下水一花岗岩的反应处于稳定的长期平衡状态。这种地球化学环境对于高放射性废物的永久处置是有利的。						0	2	0		1	0	2			0001-5717			CSCD:1809556

Evidence for mineralization into gaseous dinitrogen								INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PHOTOENERGY				5	2	SI		51	58		10.1155/S1110662X03000138				2003	2003	The photocatalytic degradation of two azo-dyes- an industrial one ( Congo Red (CR)), and an alimentary one ( Amaranth (AM)) - has been investigated in TiO2/UV aqueous suspensions. In addition to a prompt removal of the colors, TiO2/UV-based photocatalysis was simultaneously able to fully oxidize the dyes, with a complete mineralization of organic carbon into CO2. In particular, the aromatic rings were submitted to successive attacks by photogenerated OHo radicals leading to hydroxylated metabolites before the ring opening and the final evolution of CO2 induced by repeated subsequent "photo-Kolbe" reactions with carboxylic intermediates. Simultaneously, sulfur heteroatoms were converted into innocuous SO42- ions. The mineralization of nitrogen was more complex to analyze. Nitrogen atoms in the - 3 oxidation state, such as in the amino-groups of CR, initially remained at this reduction degree and produced NH4+ cations, subsequently and very slowly converted into NO3- anions. For both azo-dyes (CR and AM) degradation, the overall mass balance in nitrogen was always found incomplete. Various experiments performed in pure oxygen in a vacuum-tight cell and then in an air-free photoreactor (but filled with pure oxygen) enabled us to put in evidence the formation of N-2. Quantitative measurements clearly indicated that gaseous dinitrogen evolved stoichiometrically corresponded to the mineralization of the central - N=N- azo-group. This constitutes the ideal issue for the elimination of nitrogen-containing pollutants, not only for environmental photocatalysis but also for any other physicochemical method. These results suggest that TiO2/UV photocatalysis may be envisaged as a method for treatment of diluted colored waste waters not only for decolorization but also for total detoxification, in particular in textile industries in semi-arid countries.					2nd European Meeting on Solar-Chemistry and Photocatalysis2nd European Meeting on Solar-Chemistry and Photocatalysis	MAY, 2002MAY, 2002		ST AVOLD, FRANCEST AVOLD, FRANCE	25	0	0	0	6	0	25			1110-662X	1687-529X		WOS:000181776000004		
J	Qiao, Yangyang; Evje, Steinar								A general cell-fluid Navier-Stokes model with inclusion of chemotaxis								MATHEMATICAL MODELS & METHODS IN APPLIED SCIENCES				30	6	SI		1167	1215		10.1142/S0218202520400096				JUN 15 2020	2020	The main purpose of this work is to explore a general cell-fluid model which is based on a mixture theory formulation that accounts for the interplay between oxytactically (chemotaxis toward gradient in oxygen) moving bacteria cells in water and the buoyance forces caused by the difference in density between cells and fluid. The model involves two mass balance and two general momentum balance equations, respectively, for the cell and fluid phase, combined with a convection-diffusion-reaction equation for oxygen. In particular, the momentum balance equations include interaction terms which describe the cell-fluid drag force effect. Hence, the model is an extension of the classical Navier-Stokes equation in two different ways: (i) inclusion of two phases (cell and fluid) instead of one; (ii) inclusion of a chemotactic transport mechanism. The model can be understood as a natural generalization of the much studied chemotaxis-Stokes model explored by [I. Tuval, L. Cisneros, C. Dombrowski, C. W. Wolgemuth, J. O. Kessler and R. E. Goldstein, Bacterial swimming and oxygen transport near contact lines, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 102 (2005) 2277-2282]. First, we explore the model for parameters in a range which ensures that it lies close to the previously studied chemotaxis-Stokes model (essentially very low cell volume fraction). Main observations are (i) formation of sinking finger-shaped plumes and (ii) convergence to plumes that possibly can be stationary (i. e. persist over time). The general cell-fluid model provides new insight into the role played by the cell-fluid interaction term which controls the competition between gravity segregation and chemotaxis effect on the formation of cell plumes. Second, we explore cases with large cell volume fraction (far beyond the regime captured by the chemotaxis-Stokes model), which gives rise to rich pattern-formation behavior. The general cell-fluid model opens for exploring a hierarchy of different "submodels". Hence, it seems to be an interesting model for further investigations of various, general cell-fluid spatio-temporal evolution dynamics, both from an experimental and mathematical point of view.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			0218-2025	1793-6314		WOS:000547509600005

Effects studied included the initial rate of O-2 reduction, total O-2-scavenging capacity to maintain critically low O-2 concentration through storage, and effects of ethanol on microbial growth and evolution of headspace CO2 and O-2. Active packaging system effectively extended mold-free shelf life of preservative-free cake from similar to 1 day (control) to more than 42 days. By significantly retarding microbial growth and activities, active packaging shifts the critical shelf life determination reaction to physicochemical deteriorations. OS retarded lipid oxidation and enhanced color stability of the cake. EE delayed staling. PVDC-coated nylon enhanced the efficiency of active packaging better than nylon. The combination of OS and EE synergistically delayed microbial spoilage as well as physical and chemical deteriorations. Application of active packaging systems is an effective alternative preservation technology for prolonging the shelf life of highly perishable sponge cake without the direct addition of chemical preservatives into the bakery formula.

The finite element and updated Lagrangian approach was used to solve the dynamic equation sets and compile the modeling code. The Xiangxi Gold Mine was taken as an example to illustrate the application of this model in the simulation and prediction of the quality of tailings effluents. The numerical modeling results suggest that tailings-water interaction at the early stage leads to the acidification and release of heavy metals which are responsible for the persistent pollution to the environment for 30 years. Tailings pore water can be gradually neutralized and the content of polluted species tends to decline markedly with time. It is also shown that the gangue dissolution and organic matter reaction can stimulate the acid neutralization and decrease the diffusion rate of oxygen in tailings impoundments. The content of pore-water species in upper tailings is significantly higher than in lower part and changes severely at 6 m depth. Hence the hydrological zoning phenomenon in tailings impoundments accounts for geochemical zonation. Our modeling results agree with field data very well, suggesting that this model has the potential to predict drainage quality of sulfide mine tailing impoundments.					2010 Sixth International Conference on Natural Computation (ICNC 2010)2010 Sixth International Conference on Natural Computation (ICNC 2010)	10-12 Aug. 201010-12 Aug. 2010		Yantai, Shandong, ChinaYantai, Shandong, China	0	0	0		0	0	0					978-1-4244-5961-2	INSPEC:11554638

The inclusions found in the consumable electrode were MnS, MgO center dot Al2O3 and MnS adhering to MgO center dot Al2O3. MnS inclusions were nearly spherical and ellipse in morphology, and most of them were less than 2 mu m in size. MgO center dot Al2O3 inclusions were polygonal and nearly spherical and most about 1-4 mu m in size. The inclusions in ESR ingot observed by scanning electron microscopy-energy-dispersive X-ray spectrometer were polygonal and nearly spherical MgO center dot Al2O3. MnS inclusions in the consumable electrode were completely dissociated before the liquid film dripping into molten slag pool. The controlling step of MnS inclusions dissociation was the mass transfer of [Mn] in the liquid steel. During the solidification process, the thermodynamic driving force could not meet MnS inclusions precipitation before the solid fraction exceeds 0.996, and the kinetics condition is too poor for the growth of MnS inclusions in the steel when the solid fraction is larger than 0.996. MgO center dot Al2O3 inclusions in ESR ingot originated from the remained MgO center dot Al2O3 inclusions in consumable electrode and the fresh ones formed by the reaction between dissolved magnesium, oxygen and aluminum in liquid steel.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			1006-706X	2210-3988		WOS:000725367400001

However, harsh reaction conditions (high alkalinity or toxic organic solvents), with low biomass conversion and selectivity are often reported in literature. In this work, we report glucose photoreforming for coproduction of H-2 and arabinose with improved selectivity under neutral condition using carbon quantum dots (CQDs) modified TiO2 composites. We show that the conventional CQDs fabricated by a facile one-step hydrothermal process could be endowed with novel color changing property, due to the particle aggregation under the regulation of incident light. The as-fabricated CQDs/TiO2 composites with certain colored CQDs could greatly improve glucose to arabinose conversion selectivity (similar to 75%) together with efficient hydrogen evolution (up to 2.43 mmolh (1)g(1)) in water. The arabinose is produced via the direct Cl -C2 alpha-scissions mechanism with reactive oxygen species of center dot O-2 and center dot OH, as evidenced by C-13 labeled glucose and the electron spin-resonance (ESR) studies, respectively. This work not only sheds new lights on CQDs assisted photobiorefinery for biomass valorization and H-2 coproduction, but also opens the door for rationale design of different colored CQDs and their potential applications for solar energy utilization in the noble-metal-free system.

Rapid thermal annealing (RTA) of the Ti/TiN bilayers has been found to strongly affect subsequently deposited W films. The stress in W is reduced as a consequence of the RTA treatment of Ti/TiN, and the stress reduction is especially pronounced for thin W films. However, the stress in the Ti/TiN bilayers deposited at 300 or 550 degrees C increases substantially after the RTA treatment at 650 degrees C, leading to appreciable increase in the total stress of the whole Ti/TiN/W stack. The nucleation deposition of W on the annealed Ti/TiN is somewhat hindered. The retardation of W growth on annealed Ti/TiN is discussed in terms of thermodynamics and classical nucleation theory in conjunction with the reduction of the interfacial impurities (i.e. fluorine and oxygen) as a result of the RTA of Ti/TiN [A. Mouroux, R. Palmans, J. Keinonen, S,-L. Zhang, K. Maex, S.

Mikrobiologiia				82	5			534	41						2013 Sep-Oct	2013	For three species of anoxygenic phototrophic alphaproteobacteria differing in their reaction to oxygen and light, physiological characteristics (capacity for acetate assimilation, activity of the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle enzymes, respiration, and the properties of the oxidase systems) were studied. Nonsulfur purple bacteria Rhodobacter sphaeroides, Rhodobaca bogoriensis, and aerobic anoxygenic phototrophic bacteria Roseinatronobacter thiooxidans were the subjects of investigation. All these organisms were able to grow under aerobic conditions in the dark using the respiratory system with cytochrome aa3 as the terminal oxidase. They differed, however, in their capacity for growth in the light, bacteriochlorophyll synthesis, and regulation of activity of the TCA cycle enzymes. Oxygen suppressed bacteriochlorophyll synthesis by Rha. sphaeroides and Rbc. bogoriensis both in the dark and in the light. Bacteriochlorophyll synthesis in Rna. thiooxidans occurred only in the dark and was suppressed by light. The results on acetate assimilation by the studied strains reflected the degree of their adaptation to aerobic growth in the dark. Acetate assimilation by light-grown Rha. sphaeroides was significantly higher than by the dark-grown ones. Unlike Rha. sphaeroides, acetate assimilation by Rbc. bogoriensis in the light under anaerobic and aerobic conditions was much less dependent on the growth conditions. Aerobic acetate assimilation by all studied bacteria was promoted by light. In Rha. sphaeroides, activity of the TCA cycle enzymes increased significantly in the cells grown aerobically in the dark. In Rbc. bogoriensis, activity of most of the TCA cycle enzymes under aerobic conditions either decreased or remained unchanged. Our results confirm the origin of modern chemoorganotrophs from anoxygenic phototrophic bacteria. The evolution from anoxygenic photoorganotrophs to aerobic chemoorganotrophs included several stages: nonsulfur purple bacteria --> nonsulfur purple bacteria similar to Rbc. bogoriensis --> aerobic anoxygenic phototrophs --> chemoorganotrophs.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0026-3656			MEDLINE:25509391	25509391	
J	Fan, Yazhuo; Cheng, Xuan								Porous IrO2-Ta2O5 Coating Modified with Carbon Nanotubes for Oxygen Evolution Reaction								JOURNAL OF THE ELECTROCHEMICAL SOCIETY				163	8			E209	E215		10.1149/2.0021608jes				2016	2016	A novel porous coating consisting of iridium oxide (IrO2) and tantalum oxide (Ta2O5), modified with multiwalled carbon nanotubes (CNT) was prepared on a titanium (Ti) substrate. The Ta2O5 was obtained by the oxidation of tantalum chloride (TaCl5), and followed by the formation of tantalum carbide (TaC) through the reduction of Ta2O5 with CNT, which generated the intermediate layer of Ta2O5-CNT-TaC. The presence of TaC inhibited the grain growth and refined the particle sizes in the intermediate layer, enhancing the adhesion between the particles, while the introduction of CNT promoted the growth of IrO2 columnar nanocrystal arrayed particles on the active layer, which strengthened the adhesion between the active coating and the substrate. Four characteristic processes involving initiated, continuous, intercrossing and complete coating growths were identified, and further correlated to the electrochemical performance, life and failure behaviors of the coatings. The life of the novel IrO2-Ta2O5-CNT coated Ti electrode was three times longer than that of the conventional IrO2-Ta2O5 coated Ti electrode in sulfuric acid solutions. The electrode failure was mainly caused by the consumption of Ta2O5 at the coating, which damaged the porous structures and destroyed the pore channels. (C) 2016 The Electrochemical Society.

Within itself this kingdom is heterogenous regarding the mechanisms for deriving energy from the environment for support of cellular functions. These comprise fermentative and chemolithotrophic pathways as well as light driven and respiratory energy conservation. Due to their extreme growth conditions access to the molecular machineries of energy transduction in archaea can be experimentally limited. Among the aerobic, extreme thermoacidophilic archaea, the genus Sulfolobus has been studied in greater detail than many others and provides a comprehensive picture of bioenergetics on the level of substrate metabolism, formation and utilization of high energy phosphate bonds, and primary energy conservation in respiratory electron transport. A number of novel metabolic reactions as well as unusual structures of respiratory enzyme complexes have been detected. Since their genomic organization and many other primary structures could be determined, these studies shed light on the evolution of various bioenergetic modules. It is the aim of this comprehensive review to bring the different aspects of Sulfolobus bioenergetics into focus as a representative example of, and point of comparison for closely related, aerobic archaea.									57	1	0	0	48	0	58			0005-2728	0006-3002		WOS:A1996VX98700001	8982385

Taking the graphitic carbon nitride (g-CN) polymer as an example, we report a novel photoanode based on a vertically aligned g-CN porous nanorod (PNR) array prepared in situ, using a thermal polycondensation approach, with anodic aluminum oxide as the template. The g-CN PNR array exhibits an excellent photocurrent density of 120.5 mu A cm(-2) at 1.23 V-RHE under one sun illumination, the highest reported incident photon-to-current efficiency of similar to 15% at 360 nm, and an outstanding oxygen evolution reaction stability in 0.1 M Na2SO4 aqueous solution, which constitutes a benchmark performance among the reported g-CN-based polymer photoanodes without any sacrificial reagents. When compared with its planar counterpart, the enhanced performance of the PNR array results principally from its unique structure that enables a high degree of aromatic ring pi-electron conjugation for higher mobility of charge carriers, provides a direct pathway for the electron transport to the substrate, produces a large portion of hole-accepting defect sites and space charge region to promote exciton dissociation, and also withstands more strain at the interface to ensure intimate contact with the substrate. This work opens a new avenue to develop nanostructured organic semiconductors for large-scale application of solar energy conversion devices.									39	1	0	0	2	0	39			1530-6984	1530-6992		WOS:000444793500084	30102049

Herein, synchronization iodine surface modified and doped porous carbon nitride (CNI) was prepared. The self-assembly precursors from urea and ammonium iodide were firstly obtained by liquid nitrogen-assisted rapid re-crystallization and lyophilization technology. After the heat treatment of above precursors, CNI was easily synthesized. Compared with bulk CN, CNI shows large specific surface area (57.59 m(2) g(-1)), due to freeze-drying treatment and thermal decomposition of ammonium iodide. As electron donors, iodine species can enrich the electron density in the carbon nitride network and tune the electronic band structure. It is important the surface iodine modification can bound the positive charge holes to inhibit the recombination of photogenerated carriers. As a result, CNI exhibits prompted photocatalytic hydrogen evolution rate of 114.0 mu mol h(-1) under visible-light irradiation (lambda > 420 nm), better than that of bulk CN. This work may provide a promising rapid method for designing another porous and effective semiconductor photocatalysts.									10	0	0	0	2	0	10			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000472176900127

It is assumed that the efficiency of material removal during ECM depends on the structure and composition of this oxide layer as well as on the microstructure of the material. Therefore, 42CrMo4 in different microstructures (ferritic-pearlitic and martensitic) was subjected to two ECM processes with current densities of about 20 A/cm(2) and 34 A/cm(2), respectively. The composition of the process electrolyte was analyzed via mass spectrometry with inductively coupled plasma in order to obtain information on the efficiency of material removal and the reaction mechanisms. This was followed by an X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analysis to detect the chemical composition and the binding states of chemical elements in the oxide formed during ECM. In summary, it has been demonstrated that the efficiency of material removal in both ECM processes is about 5-10% higher for martensitic 42CrMo4 than for ferritic-pearlitic 42CrMo4. This is on one hand attributed to the presence of the cementite phase at ferritic-pearlitic 42CrMo4, which promotes oxygen evolution and therefore has a negative effect on the material removal efficiency. On the other hand, it is assumed that an increasing proportion of Fe2O3 in the mixed oxide leads to an increase in the process efficiency.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2				1996-1944		WOS:000650563400001	33922262

The cap layer represented a nitrogen-doped layer on top of a highly boron doped film, thus forming a surface p-n junction. The presence of the cap layer reduced the background current down to the pA/mm(2) range and shifted the hydrogen-and the oxygen evolution to higher potentials, leading to a potential window of approx. 6 V. Individual electrodes of 600 nm in diameter were introduced using e-beam lithography and plasma etching through the cap layer down to the p(+) diamond, leading to a sub-microelectrode array structure. The activity of the sub-microelectrodes could be observed within this 6 V-window at lower potentials. At the same time, the interface capacitance and the background current remained unchanged compared to the initial p-n junction electrode without etched holes. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

The active material of the positive electrode is oxygen contained in the ambient air. Therefore, zinc-air batteries have an open cell configuration. The external condition is one of the main factors for zinc-air batteries. One of the most important external conditions is temperature. To confirm the effect of temperature on the electrochemical properties of zinc-air batteries, we perform various analyses under different temperatures. Under 60 degrees C condition, the zinc-air cell shows an 84.98 % self-discharge rate. In addition, high corrosion rate and electrolyte evaporation rate are achieved at 60 degrees C. Among the cells stored at various temperature conditions, the cell stored at 50 degrees C delivers the highest discharge capacity; it also shows the highest self-discharge rate (65.33 %). On the other hand, the cell stored at 30 degrees C shows only 2.28 % self-discharge rate.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1225-0562	2287-7258		WOS:000616499300008

GANIL/SPIRAL: present and future								Proceedings of the International Symposium New Projects and Lines of Research in Nuclear Physics								372	82						2003	2003	The first accelerated exotic beam of the SPIRAL ("Production System of Radioactive Ion and Acceleration On-Line") facility at GANIL, Caen has been delivered for the first experiment in the end of September 2001. The 18Ne (half-live of 1.67s) isotope has been produced through the projectile fragmentation of a 20Ne primary beam at 95A MeV on a carbon target, located at the new underground production cave of SPIRAL. SPIRAL can presently deliver beams of noble gas, oxygen, nitrogen and fluorine with optima intensities using the present target and ion source in the energy range of 1.7A to 25A MeV, depending on the Q/A ion ratio. In a context of fast evolution in the European and international level we considered the possibility of an intensity upgrade of GANIL in its domain of excellence, i.e. beams in the energy domain of about 100A MeV for low to medium mass nuclei (A<100). We have evaluated the possibility of producing beams of several hundreds of kilowatts, i.e. of the order of 1-5 mA, corresponding to 6times1015 particles/s for light particles and 3times10l4/s for heavier particles via a superconducting linac accelerator. This is the LINAG project, which in a first phase (40MV of acceleration voltage, called SPIRAL2) will deliver deuterons and light heavy ions for RIB production.

Using non-precious catalyst electrodes based on recyclable carbon nanostructures is most important to produce clean energy and increase the ability to commercialize the fuel cells. Herein, reduced graphene oxide (rGO) and graphene/magnetic iron oxide nanocomposite (rGO/MIO) are successfully synthesized as anode and cathode, respectively, from polyethylene terephthalate (PET) waste bottles using easy steps in order to simplify the method and reducing the production cost. While, the membrane is prepared from low cost and eco-friendly ternary polymers blend which are polyvinyl alcohol (PVA), polyethylene oxide (PEO) and polyvinyl pyrrolidone (PVP) then doped with sulfonated graphene oxide. The prepared electrodes have characteristic high porosity and their electrocatalytic performances are evaluated using three-electrode cell electrochemical studies as cyclic voltammetry and linear scan voltammetry combined with rotating disk electrode. A new assembly of the membrane between two non-precious catalyst electrodes as a single polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cell (PEMFC) was developed using a catalyst-coated membrane technique. The membrane electrode assembly (MEA) design parameters which affect its performance in hydrogen fuel cells as number of used catalyst layers (CL) or using gas diffusion layer (GDL) were evaluated in a single cell set-up with H-2/O-2 operation and the results revealed that the performance MEA was enhanced with using GDL more than that of MEA without GDL by 66% at a current density of 0.8 A cm(-2) while the performance with double CL was better than that of the conventional single CL by 30% at a current density of 0.98 mA cm(-2).									16	0	0	0	1	0	16			2296-8016			WOS:000508833800001

In this work, for the first time, novel CoxP/K+Ca2Nb3O10- nanostructures (abbreviated as CoxP/KCNOus) were synthesized by integrating noble-metal-free CoxP nanoparticles onto the surface of K+Ca2Nb3O10- ultrathin nanosheets (abbreviated as KCNOus), and exhibited enhanced photocatalytic hydrogen generation. Under the irradiation of xenon light, the hydrogen generation rate of the resulting optimal CoxP/KCNOus reached up to 90.4 mu mol g(-1) h(-1), approximately 5.78 times higher than that of single-component KCNOus. The apparent quantum efficiency (AQE) of CoxP/KCNOus is 1.32% at 350 nm. Based on photoluminescence (PL), UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (UV-vis DRS), and photo-electrochemical analyses, possible reasons for this improved photocatalytic activity can be ascribed to the enhanced light absorption capacity and strong separation efficiency of photoinduced carriers over CoxP/KCNOus owing to the formation of the interfaces between KCNOus and CoxP nanoparticles. It is believed that this work will provide a new insight into the development ofefficient and low-cost noble-metal-free cocatalysts for photocatalytic hydrogen evolution reactions.									1	0	0	0	1	0	1			0957-4484	1361-6528		WOS:000536122300001	32299073

Although slow diffusion of oxygen from residual UO, to the melt can, in theory, induce subsequent precipitation of small quantities of a (U, Zr)O-2-x phase over long time intervals, no evidence for precipitation was found in the microstructures and phase compositions. Thus, the observations support the contention that UO2 dissolution effectively ceases when the melt reaction path across the U-Zr-O phase diagram intersects the boundary of the two-phase [(U, Zr)O-2-x + L] field. The saturated melt compositions have been used to revise the pseudo-binary Zr(O)-UO2 phase diagram, allowing more realistic prediction of the products formed by fuel/molten cladding interaction.									16	1	0	0	0	0	16			0022-3115			WOS:A1996VM11000002

Variations in light intensity result in concentration changes in photosynthetic intermediates or protein states. These changes in turn affect Photosystem II (PS II) by a 'backpressure effect', resulting in the accumulation of PS II products (reduced plastoquinone, lumen protons). The product backpressure produces PS II states especially susceptible to photoinactivation and photodamage. By activation of special adaptation mechanisms, the efficiency of the photosynthetic system is optimized and photodamage is minimized. The following aspects are discussed: (1) long-term vs. short-term adaptation; (2) analysis of short-term adaptation by measurement of chlorophyll alpha fluorescence and photosynthetic oxygen evolution; (3) kinetics of the response of the photosynthetic system to changes in light intensity (induction curves, assignment of phases, time constants); (4) the 'product backpressure' on PS II (accumulation of reduced Q(A), lumen pH effect on PS II donor side reactions, thylakoid voltage effect on PS II photochemistry); (5) the molecular mechanisms of short-term adaptation (pH-dependent energy quenching, reversible inactivation of the manganese complex, light-harvesting complex (LHC) phosphorylation); (6) induction of photoinactivation and photodamage; (7) relation between product backpressure, adaptation and photodamage.									78	1	2	0	69	0	83			1011-1344	1873-2682		WOS:A1994PP04100001

In this study, we showed that noble and certain non-noble metal nanoparticles can be deposited on graphite without the aid of any reducing agent. This method of reducing metal ions to metal nanoparticles by graphite involves only one step (i.e., immersion into a solution) and one chemical (i.e., a metal salt). Hence, the method is exceedingly simple, green, and does not require any energy input. Large amounts of metal nanoparticles are generated both on the surface and deep into the bulk of graphite (similar to 100 mu cm). Despite the simplicity of this method, the metal deposited on graphite showed good electrocatalytic performance for ethanol oxidation and oxygen evolution reactions and also functioned as electrodes for supercapacitors. This method is thus ideal for preparing electrocatalytic materials and electrochemical energy storage devices due to its simplicity and environmental sustainability. The simplicity of the method is due to the inherent reducing potential of graphite (i.e., a material that is generally perceived as inert). Results from analyses showed that functionalization of the reactive edges in the regions of defects allowed the graphite to serve as a reducing agent. Increasing the amount of defects (e.g., via chemical or simple mechanical treatments) is shown to be the fundamental principle for increasing the reactivity of graphite.									13	1	0	0	1	0	13			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000490357900025	31518101

The rapidity and flexibility of the acquisition of Raman spectra places this technique as a good candidate to measure operating properties and changes. Raman spectroscopy has been applied to well-known lanthanide ceria materials and the structural dependence on the dopant has been extracted. The evolution of Pr-doped ceria with temperature has been recorded by means of a commercial cell showing a clear increment in oxygen vacancies concentration. To elucidate the changes undergone by the electrolyte or membrane material in cell operation, the detailed construction of a homemade Raman cell is reported. The cell can be electrified, sealed and different gases can be fed into the cell chambers, so that the material behavior in the reaction surface and species evolved can be tracked. The results show that the Raman technique is a feasible and rather simple experimental option for operating characterization of solid-state electrochemical cell materials, although the treatment of the extracted data is not straightforward.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2				2077-0375		WOS:000557872500001	32664201

An analysis of the X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) and extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) for the Co and Fe K-edges of these composite hydrous oxides revealed that, regardless of the oxidation state of nickel sites in the films, the guest metal ions are present as Co3+ and Fe3+ and that the cobalt-oxygen distance d(Co-O) = 1.90 +/- 0.02 Angstrom and d(Fe-O) = 1.92 +/- 0.02 Angstrom. The latter values are in excellent agreement with d(Me-O) (Me = Co or Fe) in CoOOH and beta- and gamma-FeOOH, respectively, determined by conventional X-ray diffraction. Two clearly defined Me-Ni first coordination shells could be observed in the Fourier transforms (FT) of the K-edge EXAFS of the guest metal recorded at a potential at which both Ni2+ and Ni3+ sites are expected to be present. The relative intensities of these FT features could be varied by changing the applied potential or, equivalently, the relative population of the two nickel sites. On the basis of these results, the Me-Ni shells are ascribed to Co3+ adjacent to Ni2+ and Ni3+ sites. Furthermore, d(Ni-Co) and d(Ni-Fe) for a given nickel oxidation state are found to be essentially the same as those observed for d(Ni-Ni) in pure nickel hydrous oxide films. This provides evidence that Co3+ and Fe3+ ions replace Ni sites in the hydrous oxide lattice, forming single-phase materials.									59	0	0	0	4	1	59			0022-3654			WOS:A1994PK74000049

The as deposited 250 nm thin zirconia films presented a structure consisting of two phases: the expected monoclinic one and also an unexpected tetragonal phase. According to the literature, the stabilization of the tetragonal phase (metastable in massive zirconia) can be related to the crystallite size and/or to the generated internal compressive stresses. To analyze the effect of internal and external stresses on the thin film behaviour, in-situ tensile experiments were performed at room temperature and at high temperature (500 degrees C). Depending on the process parameters, phase transformations and damage evolution of the films were observed. Our results, associated to XRD (X-ray diffraction) analyses, used to determine phase ratios and residual stresses within the films, before and after the mechanical experiments, are discussed with respect to their microstructural changes.

J	Chun, JH; Jeon, SK								Determination of the equilibrium constant and standard free energy of the over-potentially deposited hydrogen for the cathodic H-2 evolution reaction at the Pt-Rh alloy electrode interface using the phase-shift method								INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY				28	12			1333	1343		10.1016/S0360-3199(03)00003-X				DEC 2003	2003	The Langmuir adsorption isotherm of the over-potentially deposited hydrogen (OPD H) for the cathodic H-2 evolution reaction (HER) at the Pt-Rh (Pt:Rb; 80:20 wt%) alloy/0.5 M H2SO4 aqueous electrolyte interface has been studied using cyclic voltammetric and ac impedance techniques. The behavior of the phase shift (0degrees less than or equal to - phi less than or equal to 90degrees) for the optimum intermediate frequency can be linearly related to that of the fractional surface coverage (1 greater than or equal to theta greater than or equal to 0) of the OPD H for the cathodic HER at the interface. The phase-shift profile (-phi vs. E) for the optimum intermediate frequency, i.e., the phase-shift method, can be used as a new electrochemical method to determine the Langmuir adsorption isotherm (0 vs. E) of the OPD H for the cathodic HER at the interface. At the Pt-Rh alloy electrode interface, the equilibrium constant (K) and the standard free energy (DeltaGads) of the OPD H are 2.2 x 10(-4) and 20.9 kJ/mol, respectively. At the steady state, the behaviors of the cyclic voltammogram and the Langmuir adsorption isotherm of the OPD H for the cathodic HER at the Pt-Rh alloy electrode interface are similar to those of the pure Pt electrode interfaces. At the steady state, the effect of Rh on the OPD H for the cathodic HER can be neglected at the Pt-Rh (Pt:Rh; 80:20 wt%) alloy/0.5 M H2SO4 aqueous electrolyte interface.

Here, the surface structure of the c(2 x 2) reconstruction of RuO2(100) is predicted by ab initio molecular dynamics simulations and shown to be consistent with available surface science experiments from the literature, including scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) images, low-energy electron diffraction (LEED) intensity versus voltage experiments, and thermal desorption experiments of O-2. Mechanistically, the c(2 x 2) reconstruction starts from a simple c(2 x 2) overlayer structure of on-top O on RuO2(100), where the remaining undercoordinated surface Ru centers shift laterally toward the on-top O position, thereby breaking two Ru-O back bonds to lattice oxygen and forming a new Ru-O bond with on-top O. This leads to the formation of a tetrahedrally coordinated surface species Ru-4f, a process that is activated by 0.95 eV and that results in an energy stabilization of 0.66 eV. The c(2 x 2) surface structure can readily explain the lack of activity in catalytic CO oxidation. The CO molecule is much more weakly bound on RuO2(100)-c(2 x 2) reconstruction than on the RuO2(110) or the RuO2(100)-(1 x 1) surface, and in addition, the Ru-4f centers are too far apart to allow for O-2 activation. The identified Ru-4f surface species is expected to play a prevailing role as precursor species in the missing thermal and electrochemical stability of RuO2 under oxidizing reaction conditions by forming volatile RuO4.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1932-7447	1932-7455		WOS:000742107200001

It generates a high photovoltage due to a unique effect of metal nano-contact and is stabilized by surface alkylation. In the present work, we have prepared a composite electrode, composed of the surface methylated and Pt nano-dotted n-Si single crystal electrode and a tungsten trioxide (WO3) particulate thin film, to decompose water into oxygen and H+ ions under solar irradiation. The onset potential of the oxygen evolution photocurrent for the composite electrode shifts to the negative by about 0.2 V compared with that for the WO3 electrode alone, indicating that the two-step, Z-scheme mechanism operates in the composite electrode, leading to generation of a high photovoltage that comes from a series sum of the photovoltage in the Si and that in the WO3. It is discussed that a composite "polycrystalline Si / visible-light responsive metal-oxide thin-film" electrode is a promising approach to high-efficiency and low-cost solar water splitting.

Type I Cu mediates electron transfer between the substrate and the trinuclear Cu center formed by a type II Cu and a pair of type III Cu's, where the final electron acceptor O-2 is converted to H2O without releasing activated oxygen species. During the process; 0(2) is reduced by MCOs such as lacquer laccase and bilirubin oxidase; the reaction intermediate II with a possible doubly OH--bridged structure in the trinuclear Cu center has been detected. The preceding reaction intermediate I has been detected by the reaction of the lacquer laccase in a mixed valence state, at which type I Cu was cuprous and the trinuclear Cu center was fully reduced, and by the reaction of the Cys -> Ser mutant for the type I Cu site in bilirubin oxidase and CueO. An acidic amino acid residue located adjacent to the trinuclear Cu center was proved to function as a proton donor to these reaction intermediates. The substrate specificity of MCO for organic substrates is produced by the integrated effects of the shape of the substrate-binding site and the specific interaction of the substrate with the amino acid located adjacent to the His residue coordinating to the type I Cu. In contrast, the substrate specificity of the cuprous oxidase, CueO, is produced by the segment covering the Cu(I)-binding site so as to obstruct the access of organic substrates. Truncating the segment spanning helix 5 to helix 7 greatly reduced the specificity of CueO for Cu(I) and prominently enhanced the low oxidizing activity for the organic substrates, indicating the success of protein engineering to modify the substrate specificity of MCO.

This goal could be achieved by fine-tuning the composition and structure of the electrocatalytic materials. Here, a facile self-templated synthetic strategy is developed for the fabrication of hierarchical Co-Fe oxyphosphide microtubes (MTs). Fe-based metal-organic compound microrods are first synthesized as the self-sacrificing template. Afterward, the Fe-based precursors are converted into hierarchical Co-Fe layered double hydroxide MTs through a hydrothermal approach, which are then transformed into the hierarchical Co-Fe oxyphosphide MTs by a phosphidation treatment. Benefiting from the synergistic effect of the compositions and the advantages of the hierarchical hollow structure, the obtained electrocatalyst exhibits enhanced performance for overall water splitting.									172	10	0	0	8	0	174				2198-3844		WOS:000475847500001	31508276

This is a very hard call. It will not only involve improving more efficient use of energy but also the establishment of new technologies and infrastructures for its generation and distribution. Among renewable energy resources able to tackle these challenges significantly are nuclear or those derived from solar radiation. However in the case of nuclear fusion, a technological breakthrough is required while nuclear fission is limited in the long run by the finite supply of uranium fuel. Here I focus on solar energy which is already contributing to the challenge of COP21. In particular, I discuss its capture and storage through the splitting of water to produce oxygen and hydrogen reducing equivalents, which is essentially the route taken by biology about 3 billion years ago. In so doing I will describe how Nature goes about achieving this fundamental energy converting reaction as a back drop to efforts to achieve the same goal using non-biological photo-electrochemical technology.									18	3	0	0	0	0	19			2398-4902			WOS:000431422700001

The microstructural and chemical state characters of the films with the Fe doping range from 1 to 10 at% were systematically investigated by X-ray diffraction and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. Evolution of the preferred orientation and strain status of BaTiO3 films could be observed with increasing doping amount of Fe. Meanwhile, UV-Vis spectra of doped BaTiO3 thin films showed that the band gap could be strongly affected by the doping amount of Fe with the smallest value at the Fe doping rate of 3 at%, which is proposed to be associated with the inevitable oxygen vacancies and the substitution of Ti ions by the Fe dopants.									3	1	0	0	0	0	3			0957-4522	1573-482X		WOS:000377898000117

Monolithic catalysts were prepared, corresponding to loadings of 0, 50 and 100 g CeO(2)/L, together with a catalyst containing 100 g/L of ceria-zirconia (Ce(0.7)Zr(0.3)O(2)). Loadings of the other main components (Pt, Rh and BaO) were held constant. Catalyst evaluation was performed on a bench flow reactor under simulated diesel exhaust conditions, employing NO(x) storage/reduction cycles. NO(x) storage efficiency in the temperature range 150350 degrees C was observed to increase with ceria loading, resulting in higher NO(x) conversion levels. At 150 degrees C, high rich phase NO(x) slip was observed for all of the catalysts, resulting from an imbalance in the rates of nitrate decomposition and NO, reduction. Optimal NO(x) conversion was obtained in the range 250-350 degrees C for all the catalysts, while at 450 degrees C high rich phase NO(x) slip from the most highly loaded ceria-containing catalyst resulted in lower NO(x) conversion than for the ceria-free formulation. N(2)O was the major NO(x) reduction product at 150 degrees C over all of the catalysts, although low NO(x) conversion levels limited the N(2)O yield. At higher temperatures N(2) was the main product of NO(x) reduction, although NH(3) formation was also observed. Selectivity to NH(3) decreased with increasing ceria loading, indicating that NH(3) is consumed by reaction with stored oxygen in the rear of the catalyst. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V.

Herein, we reported a vapor-phase transformation method to construct well-aligned nickel based MOFs (Ni-MOF) nanoarrays grown on electrochemical exfoliated graphite (EG) foil and further phosphorization treatment to derive a Ni-MOF/Ni2P@EG. In such a hybrid structure, Ni2P with a particle size of similar to 9 nm was encapsulated into Ni-MOF nanorod arrays on EG foil. Profiting from super hydrophilic nature and nanoarray feature, the Ni-MOF/Ni2P@EG hybrid displayed an excellent activity of hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) with low overpotentials of 132 and 233 mV at 10 and 150 mA cm(-2), respectively, as well as a small Tafel slope of 59 mV dec(-1) in alkaline media, which are among the best values in all previously reported MOFs-based hybrid HER electrocatalysts and even outperform commercial Pt/C at high current density (250 mV at 150 mA cm(-2)). The strong coupling effect of the constructed interfaces in this hybrid resulted in an efficient electron transfer from Ni2P to Ni-MOF, which promotes the adsorption of water molecules for accelerating water dissociation step, thus boosting hydrogen generation. Further, this Ni-MOF/Ni2P@EG could be used as cathode in alkaline Zn-H2O cell, reaching a power density of 4.1 mW cm(-2) with high stability to integrate hydrogen production with electricity generation.									56	7	0	0	2	0	55			2211-2855	2211-3282		WOS:000530669500032

Raw coal (HL), water-immersed for 30 days (HL-S-30), 90 days (HL-S-90) and 150 days (HL-S-150), were taken as the research objects. The pore evolution characteristics and functional group migration law of coal were explored by Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), Low-temperature Nitrogen Adsorption Test (LNAT) and Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR). The low-temperature oxidation procedure was simulated by Programmed Heating Test (PHT), and the gas release characteristics, exothermicity and ultimate spontaneous combustion parameters of the relic coal were compared. These findings demonstrated that the discriminant indexes of spontaneous combustion tendency of four specimens change periodically with temperature, but generally the spontaneous combustion intensity of HL-S-30 and HL-S-150 is greater than HL, and HL-S-90 is the least. The micro reasons for increasing oxidation activity of HL-S-30 and HL-S-150 are as follows: the number of micropores of water-immersed coal is almost 3 similar to 4 times that of HL, and the pores expanded with immersion which helps to enhance the adsorption of oxygen; the content of broken aromatic hydrocarbon -C = C- reached 50%, the total amount of hydroxy -OH decreased to 2/3 of HL, while the content of carboxyl -COOH and ether-oxygen bond -C-O- of active group doubled which are beneficial to accelerate the process of free radical chain reaction, and promote the gas release and the temperature of residual coal to reach the ignition point. The research findings enrich the basic theory of spontaneous combustion traits of water-impregnated coal, which help reduce the fire accidents and hidden dangers in actual production.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1556-7036	1556-7230		WOS:000842635700001		
J	Aleon, Jerome								Closed system oxygen isotope redistribution in igneous CAIs upon spinel dissolution								EARTH AND PLANETARY SCIENCE LETTERS				482				324	333		10.1016/j.epsl.2017.11.027				JAN 15 2018	2018	In several Calcium-Aluminum-rich Inclusions (CAIs) from the CV3 chondrites Allende and Efremovka, representative of the most common igneous CAI types (type A, type B and Fractionated with Unknown Nuclear isotopic anomalies, FUN), the relationship between O-16-excesses and TiO2 content in pyroxene indicates that the latter commonly begins to crystallize with a near-terrestrial O-16-poor composition and becomes O-16-enriched during crystallization, reaching a near-solar composition. Mass balance calculations were performed to investigate the contribution of spinel to this O-16-enrichment. It is found that a back-reaction of early-crystallized O-16-rich spinel with a silicate partial melt having undergone a O-16-depletion is consistent with the O isotopic evolution of CAI minerals during magmatic crystallization. Dissolution of spinel explains the O isotopic composition (O-16-excess and extent of mass fractionation) of pyroxene as well as that of primary anorthite/dmisteinbergite and possibly that of the last melilite crystallizing immediately before pyroxene. It requires that igneous CAIs behaved as closed-systems relative to oxygen from nebular gas during a significant fraction of their cooling history, contrary to the common assumption that CAI partial melts constantly equilibrated with gas. The mineralogical control on O isotopes in igneous CAIs is thus simply explained by a single O-16-depletion during magmatic crystallization. This O-16-depletion occurred in an early stage of the thermal history, after the crystallization of spinet, i.e. in the temperature range for melilite crystallization/partial melting and did not require multiple, complex or late isotope exchange. More experimental work is however required to deduce the protoplanetary disk conditions associated with this O-16-depletion. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

It comprises the Changpo, Bali, and Longtaoshan carbonate replacement tin deposits and the Lamo Cu-Zn skarn deposit. These deposits are hosted by Devonian carbonate-rich sedimentary rocks, which have been metamorphosed to calc-silicate skarn and marble near the contact of the Longxianggei granite.Calculated delta(OH2O)-O-18 values of the hydrothermal fluids in equilibrium with quartz, cassiterite, and calcite are 10.6 and 11.6, 9.1 to 10.2, and 7.5 to 9.8 per mil, respectively. Measured delta-D values of fluid inclusion waters in cassiterite and calcite are -115 and -120, and -73 to -93 per mil, respectively. The decrease in the calculated delta(OH2O)-O-18 values from 11.6 to 7.5 per mil is attributed to increase in the CO2 content of the hydrothermal fluids. The low delta-D values of fluid inclusion waters in cassiterite may be the result of decreasing CH4/CO2 as the originally magmatic fluid migrated from reducing conditions in carbonaceous black shale to oxidizing conditions in pure limestone. Oxygen and hydrogen isotope data indicate that the hydrothermal fluid was derived from the Longxianggei granite.Variations in delta-C-13 and delta-O-l8 values of calcite in orebodies, altered limestone, and marble are due to continuous isotopic exchange reaction between magmatic fluid and carbonate rocks at variable water to rock ratios between 300-degrees to 600-degrees-C.Sulfur isotope data indicate that host rocks controlled the variations in sulfur isotope compositions of sulfide minerals in different deposits of the tin field, with significant contribution of sulfur from magmatic fluids.									51	29	0	0	3	0	75			0361-0128			WOS:A1991GY58400007

Although NO2-/HNO2 plays an important role in atmospheric chemistry, our understanding on its role in the chemical evolution of organic components in atmospheric waters is rather incomplete and is still in dispute. In this study, the nitrite-mediated photooxidation of vanillin (VL), a phenolic compound abundant in biomass burning emissions, was investigated under pH conditions relevant for atmospheric waters. The influence of solution pH, dissolved oxygen, and center dot OH scavengers on the nitrite-mediated photooxidation of VL was discussed in detail. Our study reveals that the molecular composition of the products is dependent on the molar ratio of NO2-/VL in the solution and that nitrophenols are the major reaction products. We also found that the light absorbance of the oxidative products increases with increasing pH in the visible region, which can be attributed to the deprotonation of the nitrophenols formed. These results contribute to a better understanding of methoxyphenol photooxidation mediated by nitrite as a source of toxic nitrophenols and climatically important brown carbon in atmospheric waters.									37	1	0	0	21	0	38			0013-936X	1520-5851		WOS:000503910500021	31729864

However, the chemically active surface of silicon will be easily oxidized when exposed to the oxidation environment. We immobilized graphene oxide (GO) onto hydrogen-terminated silicon (H-Si) and reduced it through ultraviolet (UV) and vacuum-ultraviolet (VUV) irradiation. This acted as an ultrathin conductive layer to protect H-Si from oxidation. The elemental evolution of GO was studied by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and it was found that GO was partially reduced soon after the deposition onto H-Si and further reduced after UV or VUV light irradiation. The VUV photoreduction demonstrated ca. 100 times higher efficiency compared to the UV reduction based on the irradiation dose. The saturated oxygen-to-carbon ratio (R-O/C) of the reduced graphene oxide (rGO) was 0.21 +/- 0.01, which is lower than the photoreduction of GO on SiO2 substrate. This indicated the H-Si played an important role in assisting the photoreduction of GO. No obvious exfoliation of rGO was observed after sonicating the rGO-covered H-Si sample in water, which indicated rGO was immobilized on H-Si. The electrical conductivity of H-Si surface was maintained in the rGO-covered region while the exposed H-Si region became insulating, which was observed by conductive atomic force microscopy. The rGO was verified capable to protect the active H-Si against the oxidation under an ambient environment.									12	0	0	0	0	0	12			0743-7463			WOS:000413392400001	28930635

The model is validated against experimental data such as measurements of electron number density behind the strong shock wave front, temporal profile of O-2 vibrational temperature, temporal evolution of NO(gamma) radiation intensity in the post-shock region and values of time instants at which maximum quantities of radiation intensity of N-2(1+) and N-2(+)(1-) bands are achieved. It is demonstrated that the model without the allowance of processes involving electronically excited atoms and molecules overestimates the concentrations of both charged and neutral species. For electron and NO concentrations the overestimation can come up to a factor of 2. The computations also indicate the existence of a strong vibration-electron-chemistry coupling in the air plasma produced by the strong shock wave. Only the model, which takes into account such an interaction, makes it possible to properly predict the variation of gas dynamic parameters and species concentrations in the post-shock region.									35	1	4	0	0	0	39			0963-0252	1361-6595		WOS:000273895300007

However, few functional studies of PSII operation in crystals have been carried out, despite their widespread use in structural studies. Here we apply oximetric methods to determine the quantum efficiency and lifetimes of intermediates of the WOC cycle as a function of added electron acceptors (quinones and ferricyanide), both aerobically and anaerobically. PSII crystals exhibit the highest quantum yield of O-2 production yet observed of any native or isolated PSII (61.6%, theoretically 59 000 mu mol O-2/mg Chl/h). WOC cycling can be sustained for thousands of turnovers only using an electron acceptor (quinones, ferricyanide, etc.). Simulations of the catalytic cycle identify four distinct photochemical inefficiencies in both PSII crystals and dissolved PSII cores that are nearly the same magnitude. The exogenous acceptors equilibrate with the native plastoquinone acceptor at the Q(B) (or Q(C)) site(s), for which two distinct redox couples are observable that regulate flux through PSII. Flux through the catalytic cycle of water oxidation is shown to be kinetically restricted by the Q(A)Q(B) two-electron gate. The lifetimes of the S2 and S3 states are greatly extended (especially S2) by electron acceptors and depend on their redox reversibility. PSII performance can be pushed in vitro far beyond what it is capable of in vivo. With careful use of precautions and monitoring of populations, PSII microcrystals enable the exploration of WOC intermediates and the mechanism of catalysis.									7	1	0	0	2	0	7			2155-5435			WOS:000458707000064

An attractive approach is to use the abundance of solar energy that reaches the earth every day to convert water into hydrogen and oxygen (a by-product). Catalysts are a very important component of efforts to design and develop efficient water splitting technologies. Ideally, these catalysts need to operate at low overpotentials and be able to be coupled to systems that harness solar energy to achieve light-driven water splitting. Moreover, for such technologies to have maximum practical utility, the components of water splitting devices need to be made from cheap and abundant materials. Our efforts, and also those of many other research groups, have been directed at the development of catalysts for the energetically demanding and mechanistically complex water oxidation reaction (2H(2)O reversible arrow O-2 + 4H(+) + 4e(-)) which can be coupled with catalysts for proton reduction (2H(+) + 2e(-) reversible arrow w(2)) to achieve water splitting. In this review, we focus specifically on water oxidation catalysts incorporating inexpensive first row transition metals, e.g., Fe, Mn, Co and Cu, an area enjoying significant progress in recent years. We firstly review molecular water oxidation catalysts which have been tested in homogeneous solution and when introduced into heterogenous systems. Secondly, we cover the application of cheap and abundant metal oxides, based mainly on manganese, cobalt and nickel oxides, as water oxidation catalysts in electrocatalytic and photoelectrochemical devices.

Our results indicate that new energy bands will appear in the band gap of pristine MIL-125 after introducing new group into BDC linker, but the components of these band gap states and the valence band edge position are sensitive to the type of functional group as well as the corresponding amount. Especially, only the incorporation of amino group can obviously decrease the band gap of MIL-125, and the further reduction of the band gap can be observed if the amount of NH2 is increased. Although MIL-125 functionalized by NH2 group exhibits relatively weak or no activity for the photocatalytic O-2 evolution by splitting water, such ligand modification can effectively improve the efficiency in H-2 production because now the optical absorption in the visible light region is significantly enhanced. Furthermore, the adsorption of water molecule becomes more favorable after introducing of amino group, which is also beneficial for the water-splitting reaction. The present study can provide theoretical insights to design new photocatalysts based on MIL-125. (c) 2018 Author(s).

SARATOV FALL MEETING 2001: OPTICAL TECHNOLOGIES IN BIOPHYSICS AND MEDICINE III		PROCEEDINGS OF THE SOCIETY OF PHOTO-OPTICAL INSTRUMENTATION ENGINEERS (SPIE)		4707				41	52						2001	2001	An automatic device for high-temporal resolution of the process of red blood sedimentation was designed. The position of the boundary between red blood and plasma may be registered each 30 see in several pipettes simultaneously with +/-10 mkm precision. Fractional rates of the boundary movement are deduced with high accuracy. Data are processed by a PC and presented as velocity-time curves (ESR-grams) and the curves describing time evolution of the boundary position. The results obtained with this equipment demonstrate non-monotonous character of the rate of red blood sedimentation and revealed several peculiarities of macroscopic stages and microkinetic of the process. Changes of biophysical-chemical state of blood related to changes in physiological state of a donor or under the action of different substances (saline, hydrogen peroxide, Pentoxifyllin) may result either in improving (prolonging of macrokinetic stages, decreasing of sedimentation rate), or in worsening of studied parameters of blood sedimentation dynamics. A slight dilution of blood with saline in vitro leads as a rule to decreasing of sedimentation rate and improving of microkinetic parameters of the process of the red blood sedimentation. Adding of highly diluted hydrogen peroxide to blood samples of patients provides for the oxygenation of the system, and results in the improving of sedimentation dynamics: decreasing of average sedimentation rate and prolonging of macrokinetic stages. The parameters of this reaction depend upon the metabolic potential of blood, the functional state of all its cellular and plasma elements, and in complex they reflect the physiological state of the individual. Any changes in parameters of macro- and microkinetics may reflect the pattern of oxygen release-delivery-consumption in blood. ESR-graphy may give much more information in comparison to the routine ESR-test and allows to consider blood sedimentation not from the viewpoint of separate physico-chemical parameters, but treating it as a metabolically active system.					2001 Saratov Fall Meeting2001 Saratov Fall Meeting	OCT 02-05, 2001OCT 02-05, 2001	Chernyshevsky Saratov State Univ; Russian Acad Sci, Inst Precis Mech & Control; Saratov Educ & Res Ctr Opt Laser Phys & Biophys, Russian Fed Program; CRDF Res Educ Ctr Nonlinear Dynam & Biophys; Saratov State Med Univ; Volga Reg Ctr New Informat Technol; Russian Acad Nat Sci Saratov Reg Div; Russian Soc Photobiol; Minist Educ Russian Federat; Saratov Reg Minist Educ & Sci; Saratov House Sci & Culture; SPIE, Russian Chapter; Russian Fdn Basic Res; US Civilian Res & Dev Fdn, Independent States Former Soviet Union; TECHNOSERV; Erudit-96Chernyshevsky Saratov State Univ; Russian Acad Sci, Inst Precis Mech & Control; Saratov Educ & Res Ctr Opt Laser Phys & Biophys, Russian Fed Program; CRDF Res Educ Ctr Nonlinear Dynam & Biophys; Saratov State Med Univ; Volga Reg Ctr New Informat Technol; Russian Acad Nat Sci Saratov Reg Div; Russian Soc Photobiol; Minist Educ Russian Federat; Saratov Reg Minist Educ & Sci; Saratov House Sci & Culture; SPIE, Russian Chapter; Russian Fdn Basic Res; US Civilian Res & Dev Fdn, Independent States Former Soviet Union; TECHNOSERV; Erudit-96	SARATOV, RUSSIASARATOV, RUSSIA	1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0277-786X		0-8194-4457-X	WOS:000178072300005

The voltammetry experiments show that the oxidation of formic acid and formate takes place before water oxidation, which indicates that the oxidation takes place via a direct electron transfer (DET) mechanism. The current densities measured in the linear sweep voltammograms were in line with the expected limiting current densities confirming mass transfer limitations. During chrono-amperometric experiments current densities were significantly lower, indicating a decrease in the kinetic rates. This is probably related to a surface modification at the electrode. This modification is reversible as bringing the electrode to low potentials restores the activity. The stable currents observed in the chronoamperometry experiments in the region before water oxidation indicate that there is probably a second DET mechanism, which has a much higher overpotential and a different pH dependency than the first DET mechanism. Koutecky-Levich plots showed clear mixed kinetic and mass transfer control and were used to deduce the Tafel slopes of this second mechanism. The observed high Tafel slopes of 240-300 mV/dec are in line with values reported for other reactions on BDD. Experiments in a parallel plate electrolyser show that the current efficiency is approximately 100% at 2.3 V for all pHs. At higher potentials current efficiency decreases due to the water oxidation. Interestingly at these potentials the formic acid oxidation exceeds the limiting current density, possibly related to the diffusion of (OH)-O-center dot radicals or other oxidation mediators to the bulk solution or the formation of oxygen bubbles on the electrode.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			1572-6657	1873-2569		WOS:000581151800032		
J	PHILIPOSSIAN, A								THE ACTIVITY OF HF/H2O TREATED SILICON SURFACES IN AMBIENT AIR BEFORE AND AFTER GATE OXIDATION								JOURNAL OF THE ELECTROCHEMICAL SOCIETY				139	10			2956	2961		10.1149/1.2069015				OCT 1992	1992	A strong correlation is observed among surface charge, contact angle, and native oxide thickness in which up to 10,000 min of exposure time to ambient air, the liquid-HF/H2O and vapor-HF/H2O treated surfaces seem to undergo three distinct periods of evolution. The results indicate that the vapor-HF/H2O treatment yields surfaces with greater activity in ambient air. The trends, which are explained by considering the reaction between unpassivated trivalent silicon and hydroxyl groups, are shown to be consistent with XPS data on surface carbon, fluorine, and oxygen. Following thermal oxidation, the total oxide charge, oxide thickness, and contact angle are stable over time. This is possibly due to the complete surface oxide coverage. The thermal oxide thicknesses of liquid-HF/H2O and vapor-HF/H2O treated surfaces are different and can be correlated to preoxidation surface XPS results. Following thermal oxidation, no differences between vapor-HF/H2O and liquid-HF/H2O are detected in terms of oxide charge and contact angle as a function of ambient air exposure time. However, results indicate that an increase in the waiting period prior to oxidation in ambient air results in lower oxide charge values. This is attributed to the increase in hydroxyl coverage as a function of waiting period.									13	0	0	0	0	0	15			0013-4651			WOS:A1992JR76400053

Herein, phosphorus-rich colloidal cobalt diphosphide nanocrystals (CoP2 NCs) are synthesized via hot injection. The CoP2 NCs show a Pt-like hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) electrocatalytic activity in acidic solution with a small overpotential of 39 mV to achieve -10 mA cm(-2) and a very low Tafel slope of 32 mV dec(-1). Density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that the high P content both physically separates Co atoms to prevent H from over binding to multiple Co atoms, while simultaneously stabilizing H adsorbed to single Co atoms. The catalytic performance of the CoP2 NCs is further demonstrated in a metal-insulator-semiconductor photoelectrochemical device consisting of bottom p-Si light absorber, atomic layer deposition Al-ZnO passivation layers, and the CoP2 cocatalyst. The p-Si/AZO/TiO2/CoP2 photocathode shows a photocurrent density of -16.7 mA cm(-2) at 0 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) and an output photovoltage of 0.54 V. The high performance and stability are attributed to the junction between p-Si and AZO, the corrosion-resistance of the pinhole-free TiO2 protective layer, and the fast HER kinetics of the CoP2 NCs.									47	5	0	0	3	0	47			0935-9648	1521-4095		WOS:000485478200017	31058405

Among the earth-abundant metals, copper is one of the cheapest but often the most neglected choice for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) due to its high overvoltage. Herein, for the first time we have tuned the overpotential of copper by tellurizing it by two different methodologies, viz. hydrothermal and wet chemical methods, which form copper telluride nanochains and aggregates. The application of copper telluride as an electrocatalyst for the HER gave fruitful results in terms of both activity and stability. The hydrothermally synthesized catalyst Cu2-xTe/hyd shows a low overpotential (347 mV) at 10 mA cm(-2) toward the HER. In addition, the catalyst showed a very low charge transfer resistance (R-ct) of 24.4 Omega and, as expected, Cu2-xTe/hyd exhibited a lower Tafel slope value of 188 mV/dec in comparison to Cu2-xTe/wet (280 mV/dec). A chronoamperometry study reveals the long-term stability of both catalysts even up to 12 h. The Faradaic efficiency of Cu2-xTe/hyd was calculated and found to be 95.06% by using gas chromatographic (GC) studies. Moreover, with the idea of utilizing produced hydrogen (H-2) from electrocatalysis, for the first time we have carried out feedstock conversion to platform chemicals in water under eco-friendly green conditions. We have chosen cinnamaldehyde, 2-hydroxy-1-phenylethanone, 4-(benzyloxy)-benzaldehyde, and 2-(3-methoxyphenoxy)-1-phenylethanone (beta-O-4) as model compounds for feedstock conversion by hydrogenation and/or hydrogenolysis reactions in aqueous medium using external hydrogen pressure. This protocol could also be scaled up for large-scale conversion and the catalyst is likely to find industrial application since it requires an inexpensive catalyst and an easily available, mild reducing agent. The robustness of the developed catalyst is proven by recyclability experiments and its possibility of use in real-life applications.									12	0	0	0	1	0	12			0020-1669	1520-510X		WOS:000558727500076	32692572

Results: Structural and biochemical studies trace the differential reactivity to four residues. Conclusion: Differential reactivity between the enzyme homologs is a result of small changes in the enzyme active site. Significance: This work furthers our understanding of how novel activities may arise from common protein-folds.6-Pyruvoyltetrahydropterin synthase (PTPS) homologs in both mammals and bacteria catalyze distinct reactions using the same 7,8-dihydroneopterin triphosphate substrate. The mammalian enzyme converts 7,8-dihydroneopterin triphosphate to 6-pyruvoyltetrahydropterin, whereas the bacterial enzyme catalyzes the formation of 6-carboxy-5,6,7,8-tetrahydropterin. To understand the basis for the differential activities we determined the crystal structure of a bacterial PTPS homolog in the presence and absence of various ligands. Comparison to mammalian structures revealed that although the active sites are nearly structurally identical, the bacterial enzyme houses a His/Asp dyad that is absent from the mammalian protein. Steady state and time-resolved kinetic analysis of the reaction catalyzed by the bacterial homolog revealed that these residues are responsible for the catalytic divergence. This study demonstrates how small variations in the active site can lead to the emergence of new functions in existing protein folds.									14	0	0	0	13	0	14				1083-351X		WOS:000341505000032	24990950

Results showed that N-enriched pyrolysis greatly increased bio-oil and gas yields. H-2 yield increased sharply to 130 mL/g (32.93 vol%) and became the main composition at higher temperature, while CH4 and CO yields deceased, and the lower heating value of gas reached similar to 14 MJ/Nm(3). For bio-oil, the content of phenols (main compositions) and N-containing species increased significantly, and the maximums reached 61.33% and 11.47%, respectively. While that of acetic acid (disappeared), O-containing species (aldehydes/ketones/furans/esters) and aromatics decreased largely accordingly. For biochar, Nitrogen content increased, and it contained abundant pyridininc-N, pyrrolic-N, quaternary-N, and pyridone-N-oxide. Possible reaction pathways of biomass N-enriched pyrolysis was proposed based on products evolution. In conclusion, biomass N-enriched pyrolysis could obtain high-valued N-containing chemical species and functional biochar.									87	5	0	0	28	1	92			0960-8524	1873-2976		WOS:000425764100034	29049983

The temperature change stems from the emission of greenhouse gases largely contributed by burning fossil fuels; thus, its replacement with a clean, cheap, and sustainable energy source is paramount. Water is one of the integral sources and is potentially attractive to produce hydrogen (H-2) gas to substitute fossil fuels. In this respect, molecular ruthenium complexes are by far the best molecular water oxidation catalysts (WOCs) to produce proton (H+) as a source for H-2 gas production and molecular oxygen (O-2) as a clean by-product. Here, we have made an insightful chronology of the ruthenium-based water oxidation catalysts (RWOCs) and quantify and classified the activation and deactivation pathways in chemical and electrochemical water oxidation reactions (WORs). In this insightful chronology, RWOCs are classified into three main groups, including Ru (N)(6), Ru(N)(5)(O), and Ru(N)(4)(O)(2) which the last group is the most robust and powerful WOCs. However, still, there is similar to 200 mV overpotential for the Ru(N)(4)(O)(2) group of complexes which is one of the current challenges in WOR. Based on the experimental data collected over the last four decades and extracted from these three categories, we suggest a new family of RWOCs that can be the workhorse of RWOCs with very low overpotential. Moreover, the lesson learned from RWOCs has been applied to redesign metal-based WOCs.

The evolution of the crystalline phase and morphology from MnCO3 to cryptomelane was investigated by XRD, BET, SEM and TEM. Moreover, MnO2 in nanoparticle, nanorod and nanofiber shapes could be controlled by adjusting the reaction time and temperature in the acid-treatment step. MnO2 nanofibers demonstrated promoted catalytic activity and recyclability for the oxidative degradation of various organic dyes, tetracyclines and bisphenol A via peroxymonosulfate (PMS) activation. About 99% of RhB, AO7, MB, red 2 and bisphenol A at a concentration of 20-50 mg/L could be degraded over MnO2 nanofibers within 12 min. Furthermore, antibiotics, like tetracycline, chlortetracycline and oxytetracycline, and bisphenol A could be mineralized efficiently, and 69-81% TOC removal was obtained. Compared to MnO2 nanowires synthesized by the traditional method with KMnO4, MnO2 nanofibers showed enhanced surface area (102 m(2)/g), more labile lattice oxygen species and higher oxygen vacancy content, which might be responsible for the superior catalytic performances. The radical quenching test and EPR analysis proved that radical (O-2(center dot-), SO4 center dot- and OH center dot) and non-radical (O-1(2)) processes both existed, and the latter dominantly contributed to the degradation. Based on kinetic study, the activation energy of MnO2 nanofibers/PMS for RhB degradation was only 10.55 kJ/mol, which was lower than that of MnO2 nanowires (16.80 kJ/mol). This study not only offered a new, simple and economical protocol for the scaled-up synthesis of nano-scale MnO2 materials, but also demonstrated its potential in water remediation.									12	0	0	0	3	0	12			1383-5866	1873-3794		WOS:000694703800003

In this study, via binder-free electrostatic self-assembly, WS2/ZrO2 hybrids were synthesized using a two-step hydrothermal process. The catalysts were thoroughly examined using different analysis techniques. The results indicated that in the WS2/ZrO2 hybrids, ZrO2 nanoparticles (NPs) were randomly grafted on the planar surfaces of WS2 nanosheets (the ZrO2 NPs were tightly anchored to the nanosheets). The WS2/ZrO2 hybrids could considerably enhance the photocatalytic reactions under ultraviolet (UV) and simulated sunlight irradiation with an increase in the amount of ZrO2 NPs anchored to WS2 nanosheets, which influenced the photodegradation rate of crystal violet (CV) dye and the H-2 evolution activity. Notably, the rate of H-2 generation via the photolysis of water was 1023.9 mu mol g(-1) h(-1) for the WS2/ZrO2-2 catalyst, indicating both the enhanced photocatalytic degradation activity and the H-2 advancement performance of the WS2/ZrO2 hybrid. The photocatalytic H-2 advancement rate for the WS2/ZrO2-2 catalyst was 5.28 and 1.49 times higher than those for the bare WS2 catalyst under UV and simulated solar illumination, respectively. Additionally, the WS2/ZrO2-2 hybrid exhibited high recyclability owing to the highly hydrophobic nature of the 2D WS2, which was beneficial for the separation of the hybrid photocatalyst from the CV solution. Finally, the results of a scavenger-trapping experiment indicated that active holes (h(+)) were mainly responsible for the photocatalytic reaction, rather than O-center dot(2)- and (OH-)-O-center dot. Plausible photoreaction mechanisms of photocatalytic degradation and H-2 production in aqueous solutions of the WS2/ZrO2 hybrid were elucidated. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

This balance is crucial for plaque evolution in atherosclerosis, a chronic inflammatory disease. Myeloperoxidase (MPO) has been related to oxidative stress and atherosclerosis, and MPO-oxidized low-density lipoproteins (Mox-LDLs) have specific characteristics and effects. They participate in foam cell formation and cause specific reactions when interacting with macrophages and endothelial cells. They also increase the production of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) in macrophages and the resulting antioxidant response. Mox-LDLs also drive macrophage polarization. Mox-LDLs are known to be pro-inflammatory particles. However, in the presence of Mox-LDLs, endothelial cells produce resolvin D1 (RvD1), a SPM. SPMs are involved in the resolution of inflammation by stimulating efferocytosis and by reducing the adhesion and recruitment of neutrophils and monocytes. RvD1 also induces the synthesis of other SPMs. In vitro, Mox-LDLs have a dual effect by promoting RvD1 release and inducing a more anti-inflammatory phenotype macrophage, thereby having a mixed effect on inflammation. In this review, we discuss the interrelationship between MPO, Mox-LDLs, and resolvins, highlighting a new perception of the role of Mox-LDLs in atherosclerosis.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0				2076-3921		WOS:000801476800001	35624738

In this review, the properties, synthesis methods, and electrochemical applications of the cyanogel and its derivates are systematically discussed. With intrinsic properties such as 3D interconnected backbones, uniform distributions of metals at atomic level, and porous structures, the cyanogel-derived materials exhibit superior activities and stabilities. During the synthesis process, the skeleton of cyanogel serves as soft template for generating metal structures without any surfactant. Due to the versatility and tunability of cyanogels, their derivatives not only provide foreseeable opportunities for preparation of highly efficient nanomaterials in electrocatalytic reactions, but also broaden their practical applications in energy-related devices such as fuel cells, water splitting electrolyzers, metal-air batteries, energy storage batteries, and supercapacitors. Through this review, we aim to provide valuable guidelines for constructing highly effective materials in practice. (C) 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

Herein, the P-doped cobalt carbonate hydroxide@NiMoO4 (P-CoCH@NiMoO4) nanowires@nanosheets double-shell hierarchical structure is successfully fabricated on nickel foam. The unique nanowire@nanosheet structure with gradient porous distribution and hydrophilic nature can facilitate both the charge and electron transfer based on the synergetic effects with conductive NiMoO4 array. Importantly, the dopant of P element can enrich oxygen vacancies on the surface of CoCH nanowire, thus increase the effective active sites and enhance the electrocatalytic performance. Therefore, when act as the supercapacitor electrode, the bi-functional P-CoCH@NiMoO4/NF material achieves high areal capacitance (5.08 F cm(-2) at 2 mA cm(-2), 0.75 mAh cm(-2)) and good cyclic stability (82.7% capacitance retention after 2000 cycles). Meanwhile, when utilize as the hydrogen evolution electrode in alkaline solution, a low overpotential (115 mV at 10 mA cm(-2)) and Tafel slope (113.5 mV dec(-1)) can also be achieved.

However, the fast recombination rate of its photogenerated electron-hole pairs limits the photocatalytic activity of g-C3N4. Herein, we have developed highly efficient visible light driven C3N4/CoTPP type-II heterostructures by decorating cobalt(II) mesotetraphenylporphine (CoTPP) on the surface of the g-C3N4 catalyst through pi-pi supramolecular interaction. The introduction of CoTPP enhances the migration and transfer of photogenerated charge carriers and inhibits the recombination of electron-hole pairs through the formation of C3N4/CoTPP type-II heterojunctions. The C3N4/CoTPP heterostructured photocatalyst exhibits efficient spatial separation of photogenerated electrons and holes due to the well-matched overlapping band structures of two semiconductors, thus facilitating more electrons to be released for H-2 evolution. When 4 wt% (weight ratio) CoTPP is loaded onto g-C3N4, the H-2 evolution rate of the C3N4/CoTPP heterostructured photocatalyst is significantly increased up to 46.93 mu mol h(-1) under visible light irradiation (lambda >= 420 nm), which is 2.73 times higher than that of bare g-C3N4 (17.21 mu mol h(-1)). Moreover, the C3N4/4 wt% CoTPP type-II heterostructured photocatalyst shows good stability for H-2 evolution after five consecutive cycles of continuous irradiation of up to 20 h. Conclusively, the g-C3N4 photocatalyst coupled with CoTPP conjugated molecules substantially improves the photocatalytic performance and stability for H-2 evolution from water under visible light irradiation. This novel strategy sheds light on developing other highly efficient photocatalytic systems for clean energy production.									16	0	0	0	0	0	16			2044-4753	2044-4761		WOS:000468630500014

The wild type and transgenic plants were exposed to heat treatment (25-50 degrees C) for 4 h in the dark and under growth light intensity (300 mu mol m(-2) s(-1)). The analyses of oxygen-evolving activity and chlorophyll fluorescence demonstrated that photosystem II (PSII) in transgenic plants showed higher thermotolerance than in wild type plants in particular when heat stress was performed in the light, suggesting that the accumulation of glycinebetaine leads to increased tolerance to heat-enhanced photoinhibition. This increased tolerance was associated with an improvement on thermostability of the oxygen-evolving complex and the reaction center of PSII. The enhanced tolerance was caused by acceleration of the repair of PSII from heat-enhanced photoinhibition. Under heat stress, there was a significant accumulation of H2O2, O-2(-) and catalytic Fe in wild type plants but this accumulation was much less in transgenic plants. Heat stress significantly decreased the activities of catalase, ascorbate peroxidase, glutathione reductase, dehydroascorbate reductase, and monodehydroascorbate reductase in wild type plants whereas the activities of these enzymes either decreased much less or maintained or even increased in transgenic plants. In addition, heat stress increased the activity of superoxide dismutase in wild type plants but this increase was much greater in transgenic plants. Furthermore, transgenic plants also showed higher content of ascorbate and reduced glutathione than that of wild type plants under heat stress. The results suggest that the increased thermotolerance induced by accumulation of glycinebetaine in vivo was associated with the enhancement of the repair of PSII from heat-enhanced photo inhibition, which might be due to less accumulation of reactive oxygen species in transgenic plants.									134	12	0	0	125	2	148			0032-0935	1432-2048		WOS:000243964000016	16953431	
J	Nicholas, Kenneth M; Lander, Chance; Shao, Yihan								Computational Evaluation of Potential Molecular Catalysts for Nitrous Oxide Decomposition.								Inorganic chemistry				61	37			14591	14605		10.1021/acs.inorgchem.2c01598				2022-Sep-19	2022	Nitrous oxide (N2O) is a potent greenhouse gas (GHG) with limited use as a mild anesthetic and underdeveloped reactivity. Nitrous oxide splitting (decomposition) is critical to its mitigation as a GHG. Although heterogeneous catalysts for N2O decomposition have been developed, highly efficient, long-lived solid catalysts are still needed, and the details of the catalytic pathways are not well understood. Reported herein is a computational evaluation of three potential molecular (homogeneous) catalysts for N2O splitting, which could aid in the development of more active and robust catalysts and provide deeper mechanistic insights: one Cu(I)-based, [(CF3O)4Al]Cu (A-1), and two Ru(III)-based, Cl(POR)Ru (B-1) and (NTA)Ru (C-1) (POR = porphyrin, NTA = nitrilotriacetate). The structures and energetic viability of potential intermediates and key transition states are evaluated according to a two-stage reaction pathway: (A) deoxygenation (DO), during which a metal-N2O complex undergoes N-O bond cleavage to produce N2 and a metal-oxo species and (B) (di)oxygen evolution (OER), in which the metal-oxo species dimerizes to a dimetal-peroxo complex, followed by conversion to a metal-dioxygen species from which dioxygen dissociates. For the (F-L)Cu(I) activator (A-1), deoxygenation of N2O is facilitated by an O-bound (F-L)Cu-O-N2 or better by a bimetallic N,O-bonded, (F-L)Cu-NNO-Cu(F-L) complex; the resulting copper-oxyl (F-L)Cu-O is converted exergonically to (F-L)Cu-(eta2,eta2-O2)-Cu(F-L), which leads to dioxygen species (F-L)Cu(eta2-O2), that favorably dissociates O2. Key features of the DO/OER process for (POR)ClRu (B-1) include endergonic N2O coordination, facile N2 evolution from LR'u-N2O-RuL to Cl(POR)RuO, moderate barrier coupling of Cl(POR)RuO to peroxo Cl(POR)Ru(O2)Ru(POR)Cl, and eventual O2 dissociation from Cl(POR)Ru(eta1-O2), which is nearly thermoneutral. N2O decomposition promoted by (NTA)Ru(III) (C-1) can proceed with exergonic N2O coordination, facile N2 dissociation from (NTA)Ru-ON2 or (NTA)Ru-N2O-Ru(NTA) to form (NTA)Ru-O; dimerization of the (NTA)Ru-oxo species is facile to produce (NTA)Ru-O-O-Ru(NTA), and subsequent OE from the peroxo species is moderately endergonic. Considering the overall energetics, (F-L)Cu and Cl(POR)Ru derivatives are deemed the best candidates for promoting facile N2O decomposition.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0				1520-510X		MEDLINE:36067530	36067530

Two chemical processes are influencing the species diffusion in the boundary layer surrounding a re-usable Thermal Protection System: gas phase reactions and catalytic recombination at the surface. The coupling between them is not normally taken into account when determining the catalytic recombination coefficient (gamma) in plasma facilities. This work aims to provide evidence of such coupling based on both a theoretical analysis and an experimental campaign in the VKI-Plasmatron facility. Recombination coefficient measurements at off-stagnation point configuration on a linear copper calorimeter are provided. An evolution from a high-catalytic to a low-catalytic condition due to the boundary layer growth along the probe is observed. This result is consistent with a parametric analysis carried out using the in-house non-equilibrium boundary layer solver, which shows how the experimentally determined catalysis could be influenced by the amount of gas-phase recombination inside the boundary layer.

This paper focuses on the differences in statistical behaviours of the surface density function (SDF = magnitude of the reaction progress variable gradient) between conventional premixed flames and exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) type homogeneous-mixture combustion under MILD conditions using direct numerical simulations (DNS) data. The mean values of the SDF in the MILD combustion cases were found to be significantly smaller than those in the corresponding premixed flame cases. Moreover, the mean behaviour of the SDF in response to the variations of turbulence intensity were compared between MILD and premixed flame cases, and the differences are explained in terms of the strain rates induced by fluid motion and the ones arising from flame displacement speed. It was found that the effects of dilatation rate were much weaker in the MILD combustion cases than in the premixed flame cases, and the reactive scalar gradient in MILD combustion cases preferentially aligns with the most compressive principal strain-rate eigendirection. By contrast, the reactive scalar gradient preferentially aligned with the most extensive principal strain-rate eigendirection within the flame in the premixed flame cases considered here, but the extent of this alignment weakened with increasing turbulence intensity. This gave rise to a predominantly positive mean value of normal strain rate in the premixed flames, whereas the mean normal strain rate remained negative, and its magnitude increased with increasing turbulence intensity in the MILD combustion cases. The mean value of the reaction component of displacement speed assumed non-negligible values in the MILD combustion cases for a broader range of reaction progress variable, compared with the conventional premixed flames. Moreover, the mean displacement speed increased from the unburned gas side to the burned gas side in the conventional premixed flames, whereas the mean displacement speed in MILD combustion cases decreased from the unburned gas side to the middle of the flame before increasing mildly towards the burned gas side. These differences in the mean displacement speed gave rise to significant differences in the mean behaviour of the normal strain rate induced by the flame propagation and effective strain rate, which explains the differences in the SDF evolution and its response to the variation of turbulence intensity between the conventional premixed flames and MILD combustion cases. The tangential fluid-dynamic strain rate assumed positive mean values, but it was overcome by negative mean values of curvature stretch rate to yield negative mean values of stretch rate for both the premixed flames and MILD combustion cases. This behaviour is explained in terms of the curvature dependence of displacement speed. These findings suggest that the curvature dependence of displacement speed and the scalar gradient alignment with local principal strain rate eigendirections need to be addressed for modelling EGR-type homogeneous-mixture MILD combustion.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0				1996-1073		WOS:000725391200001

The SnO2 helix provides triple critical functions to enhance the PEC performance of the photoanode. First, it scatters the incident light to achieve a higher light harvesting efficiency. Second, it provides a facile electron pathway as an electron transfer layer (ETL) while blocking hole transport to mitigate charge recombination in the bulk of ZnFe2O4. Finally, it becomes a template for the formation of ZnFe2O4 dendrite nanostructure shell. The ZnFe2O4 dendrite/SnO2 helix photoanode exhibits a remarkable increase in incident photon-to-electron conversion efficiency compared to unmodified ZnFe2O4 with no ETL and modified one with "flat" SnO2 ETL. The surface of the ZnFe2O4/SnO2 helix photoanode is further modified with TiO2 passivation layer and NiFeOx oxygen evolution co-catalyst to achieve one of the best PEC performances among reported ZnFe2O4-based photoanodes.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			1613-6810	1613-6829		WOS:000697888600001	34553492

However, cost-effective hydrogen production through PEC water splitting is limited by the availability of the desired semiconductor photoanode materials. Hematite photoanode (HA) fits proper for this due to its large abundance in nature, low cost, appropriate band-gap energy, and high chemical and photochemical stability. In spite of all these merits, a practical water splitting efficiency is limited due to certain limitations associated with HA including short-hole diffusion length, high recombination rate of charge carriers, and sluggish kinetics. Several modifications in HA materials has been reported in the last decade. This article comprises recent developments toward optimizing HA for PEC water splitting such as through doping, surface modification with co-catalysts, and formation of heterojunctions. Finally, the future aspects for HA to further improve its PEC water splitting efficiency is discussed.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2452-2236			WOS:000659958300018

The temperature was measured during the discharge by optical emission spectroscopy of the second positive system of N-2, and between two discharges by two-colour OH-planar laser induced fluorescence (OH-PLIF) using two pairs of rotational transitions. Between two successive discharges, the relative density of OH was measured by OH-PLIF and was found to decay very slowly, with a 1/e decay time of about 50 mu s. With the use of a chemical kinetics model, the OH density was placed on an absolute scale.									9	1	0	0	0	0	9			0022-3727	1361-6463		WOS:000331845400015

Stability of at least 18 h was shown by chronoamperomety at 1.23 V versus RHE (reversible hydrogen electrode) under 38.6 mW/cm(2) simulated sunlight irradiation (lambda > 635 nm, AM 1.5G) and measurements with quartz crystal microbalances. Films exceeding a thickness of 4 nm were shown to be highly active though metastable due to an amorphous character. By contrast, 2 nm IrOx films were stable, enabling OER at a current density of 1 rnA/cm(2) at 1.05 V vs. RHE. Further improvement by heat treatment resulted in a cathodic shift of 40 mV and enabled a current density of 10 mA/cm(2) (requirements for a 10% efficient tandem device) at 1.12 V vs. RI-IS under irradiation. Thus, the simple IrOx/Ir/p(+)-n-Si structures not only provide the necessary overpotential for OER at realistic device current, but also harvest similar to 100 mV of free energy (voltage) which makes them among the best-performing Si-based photoanodes in low-pH media.									83	2	0	0	9	0	83			1948-7185			WOS:000337012500026	26273878

Females exhibited more growth inhibition, gas exchange rate depression and reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation; higher lipid peroxide levels, lower osmotic adjustment capacity and ascorbate-glutathione cycle enzyme activities; and more damage to cell organelles than did males under drought, salinity and especially under their combination. In addition, we found sex-specific responses in total chlorophyll content (TC), carotenoid concentration and carbon isotope composition under different osmotic stresses. Our results indicated that: (1) females are more sensitive and suffer from greater negative effects than do males under drought, salinity and especially under their combination; (2) sexual differences in adaptive responses to drought, salinity and their combination are context dependent; and (3) sex-specific reactions under a combination of stresses are distinct from single-stress responses. Thus, these results provide evidence for adaptive differentiation between sexes in responses to osmotic stresses and in the sensitivity to environmental change.									102	16	0	0	102	1	117			0140-7791	1365-3040		WOS:000281638000014	20545878

The influence of the current density and flow-rate was investigated in order to find the optimum conditions. It was found that a polymeric film, which caused BDD deactivation, was formed in the potential region of water stability during oxidation, however it was removed by high-potential anodic polarisation in the region Of 02 evolution. The complete mineralisation of the wastewater was achieved over the whole range of experimental conditions examined, due to the production of hydroxyl radicals on the diamond surface. The oxidation of the aromatic sulphonated acids was favoured by a low current density and a high flow-rate meaning that the oxidation was a diffusion-controlled process.									17	0	0	0	5	0	17			0957-4352	1741-5101		WOS:000239917300006

Different components of coal induce diverse reaction paths, and ions leached from the inherent minerals inevitably participate in the electrooxidation process. The role of inherent minerals in PEM-based CAWE cell was systematically investigated, and the coal samples were characterized by X-ray diffraction and FTIR before and after electrolysis. The results indicated that the different inherent minerals affected the current density in different ways. The oxidation of coal organic constituent and leached iron species required different onset potential and were responsible for partial current density in the low voltage range (0.8 V-1.2 V vs. SCE). In potentiostatic tests, the AAEMs ions led to sustainable increased current density by activating coal particles at the constant potential of 2 V; while the transition metal ions, such as Fe2+, tend to show stronger catalytic effect at relatively low cell potential (1.4 V vs. SCE). The evolution of oxygen-containing functional groups on coal particles surface also played an important role in the electrolysis process. The results provide a new perspective to study the promotion and inhibition mechanism of the inherent minerals.

The Zeitlupe (ZTL), Flavin-Kelch-Fbox-1 (FK.F1), and LOV-Kelch-Protein-2 (LKP2) proteins dictate measurement of the day length, flowering time, and regulation of the circadian clock by blue-light regulation of protein complex formation. Previous reports indicated that ZTL photochemistry was irreversible, which is inconsistent with its role in marking the day-night transition. A kinetic model of LOV domain function predicts that ZTL has evolved unique photochemical parameters to allow it to function as a sensor of environmental light intensity. Moreover, our model indicates that a photocatalyzed reverse reaction is required for the sensitivity of LOV domains to light fluence. Inclusion of a photocatalyzed rate constant allows the establishment of a photostationary steady state of light-activated proteins, whose relative population is sensitive to daily (circadian) or positional (phototropism) oscillations in light intensity. Photochemical characterization confirms that ZTL undergoes adduct decay on a time scale of hours in contrast to previous reports. The fast photocycle allows detection of the day- night transition facilitating circadian timing. ZTL kinetics reflect an evolutionary adaptation of the ZTL/FKF1/LKP2 family to function in distinct aspects of blue-light signaling.									32	1	0	0	29	0	32			0006-2960			WOS:000326355500023	24033190

However, semiconductors are still leading role and plasmonic metal nanoparticles are just co-catalysts in photocatalytic system. Herein, we demonstrate that an alternative pathway via constructing single Cu nanoparticles is available for robust photocatalytic overall water splitting under full-spectrum irradiation. Plasmonic Cu nanoparticles are prepared using a photo-reduction method, and identified by X-ray diffraction patterns and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. Importantly, the photocatalyst exhibits a stable and high activity for O(2 )and H-2 evolution in four consecutive runs. Our findings may provide a new strategy to develop the plasmon photocatalytic system and offer opportunities for extending the non-semiconductor photocatalysts field.									13	0	0	0	0	0	13			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000582373900060

Photosynthetic organisms are thought to be relatively more prone to microgravity, weak magnetic field and cosmic radiation because oxygenic photosynthesis is intimately associated with capture and conversion of light energy into chemical energy, a process that has adapted to relatively less complex and contained environment on Earth. To study the direct effect of the space environment on the fundamental process of photosynthesis, we sent into low Earth orbit space engineered and mutated strains of the unicellular green alga, Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, which has been widely used as a model of photosynthetic organisms. The algal mutants contained specific amino acid substitutions in the functionally important regions of the pivotal Photosystem II (PSII) reaction centre D1 protein near the Q(B) binding pocket and in the environment surrounding Tyr-161 (Y-Z) electron acceptor of the oxygen-evolving complex. Using real-time measurements of PSII photochemistry, here we show that during the space flight while the control strain and two D1 mutants (A250L and V160A) were inefficient in carrying out PSII activity, two other D1 mutants, I163N and A251C, performed efficient photosynthesis, and actively re-grew upon return to Earth. Mimicking the neutron irradiation component of cosmic rays on Earth yielded similar results. Experiments with I163N and A251C D1 mutants performed on ground showed that they are better able to modulate PSII excitation pressure and have higher capacity to reoxidize the Q(A)(-) state of the primary electron acceptor. These results highlight the contribution of D1 conformation in relation to photosynthesis and oxygen production in space.									16	0	0	0	12	0	16			1932-6203			WOS:000319107400119	23691201

Light elements (C to Ca)								ASTRONOMY & ASTROPHYSICS				433	1			285	295		10.1051/0004-6361:20040507				APR 2005	2005	Accurate relative abundances have been obtained for carbon, oxygen, sodium, aluminium, silicon, and calcium in a sample of mildly metal-poor stars. This analysis complements a previous study carried out by Jehin et al. ( 1999, AAA, 341, 241), which provided the basis for the EASE scenario. This scenario postulates that field metal-poor stars were born in self-enriched proto-globular cluster clouds. By further investigating the correlations between the different alpha-element abundances, we propose a modified scenario for the formation of intermediate metallicity stars, in which the stars exhibiting lower than average alpha/Fe abundance ratios would form in low mass clouds, unable to sustain the formation of very massive stars ( M greater than or similar to 30 M-.). Moreover, the carbon-to-iron ratio is found to decrease as one climbs the so-called Population IIb branch, i.e. when the s-element abundance increases. In the framework of the EASE scenario, we interpret this anticorrelation between the carbon and the s-element abundances as a signature of a hot bottom burning process in the metal-poor AGB stars which expelled the matter subsequently accreted by our Population IIb stars.									4	0	1	0	0	0	5			0004-6361			WOS:000227665300028

VS(2)holds great promise as a NRR electrocatalyst, but its high activity requires the sufficient activation of inert basal planes. Herein, we demonstrate the first successful activation of VS(2)basal planes toward the NRR by introducing S-vacancies (Vs) and B-dopants. The theoretical calculations unravel that the synergistic role of V(S)and B-dopants enables the most effective activation of VS(2)basal planes by creating unique B-adjacent-unsaturated-V active sites that can significantly promote the NRR while suppressing hydrogen evolution. The synthesized B-doped VS(2)nanoflowers with enriched surface Vs delivered an NH(3)yield of 55.7 mu g h(-1)mg(-1)(-0.4 V) and a faradaic efficiency (FE) of 16.4% (-0.2 V) and represent the best V-based catalysts to date. Our theoretical and experimental findings may facilitate the exploration and understanding of advanced transition-metal disulfide catalysts for the NRR.									101	9	0	0	1	0	101			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000561168500008

The evolution of the convective burning process before and during thermonuclear runaway (TNR) is discussed. We study the coupling between the burning and the hydrodynamics, which determines the nature of the convective flow, and analyze the relevant timescales. The consequences of the combustion and the nucleosynthesis are investigated in detail. The combustion process is composed of many local eruptions, scattered over the entire hydrogen envelope (at its base). Several mechanisms regulate the process in such a way that the TNR occurs over a time interval of several hundred seconds. These mechanisms are pressure waves, buoyancy, and turbulent diffusion. The TNR is terminated by a nearly spherically symmetric expansion of the outer layers of the envelope. For a I Mo core, the enrichment of the hydrogen envelope by convective overshoot is approximately 30%, in agreement with observations of novae.									98	1	0	0	0	0	98			0004-637X	1538-4357		WOS:A1997WE35500034

In this study, monodisperse Ni nanoparticles of controlled sizes were prepared by a facile method and anchored on graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) nanosheets via a self-assembly route. The noble-metal-free Ni/g-C3N4 composite catalysts exhibit excellent photocatalytic activities for the hydrolytic dehydrogenation of ammonia borane (AB) under visible light. An optimum AB hydrolysis rate was obtained when the size of the Ni NPs was 3.2 nm, with an initial turnover frequency of 18.7 mol((hydrogen)) mol((catalyst))(-1) min(-1) and an apparent activation energy of 36 kJ mol(-1). This study provides validity for constructing high performance first-row transition metal nano-photocatalysts for the hydrolytic dehydrogenation of AB.									49	2	0	0	0	0	50			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000459504400007	30741302

Most prominently deleted was CP43, which was detected by sodium dodecyl sulfate/ urea-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. D1 and CP47 were also affected by the same treatment but to a lesser extent. Deletion of CP43 did not occur when the PS II membranes were treated with Tris in the dark, or treated in the light in the presence of reductants for PS II. The results suggest that CP43 is located close to the water-oxidation site and is damaged by the oxidizing radicals produced at the oxidizing side of PS II during the Tris-treatment of the PS II membranes in the weak light. Difficulty in detecting the degradation products of CP43 indicates the high efficiency of the breakdown process of the protein.									12	1	0	0	11	0	13			0006-3002			WOS:A1992JB81500009

However, the Cr in stainless steel and its passivating property in electrochemical systems hinder the commercial use of stainless steel in the energy conversion and storage industry. Therefore, many studies have revealed the usability of stainless steel by developing various surface treatment techniques to modify the electrode surface to take advantage of the intrinsically active elements in stainless steel. In this review, we present the recent advances and breakthroughs in surface treatment approaches to adjust surface composites and the electrochemical performance and rational design of electrodes in green energy storage and conversion systems, including (photo)electrochemical water splitting, Li-ion batteries, and supercapacitors.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000795059700003

The driving forces for this dramatic lifestyle change are still a matter of discussion but the struggle for food resources and the opportunity to escape predators probably contributed. Reentering the oceans requires metabolic adaption putting evolutionary pressure on a number of genes. To explore whether eicosanoid signaling has been part of this adaptive response, we first explored whether the genomes of marine mammals involve functional genes encoding for key enzymes of eicosanoid biosynthesis. Cyclooxygenase (COX) and lipoxygenase (ALOX) genes are present in the genome of all marine mammals tested. Interestingly, ALOX12B, which has been implicated in skin development of land-living mammals, is lacking in whales and dolphins and genes encoding for its sister enzyme (ALOXE3) involve premature stop codons and/or frameshifting point mutations, which interrupt the open reading frames. ALOX15 orthologs have been detected in all marine mammals, and the recombinant enzymes exhibit similar catalytic properties as those of land-living species. All marine mammals express arachidonic acid 12-lipoxygenating ALOX15 orthologs, and these data are consistent with the Evolutionary Hypothesis of ALOX15 specificity. These enzymes exhibit membrane oxygenase activity and introduction of big amino acids at the triad positions altered the reaction specificity in favor of arachidonic acid 15-lipoxygenation. Thus, the ALOX15 orthologs of marine mammals follow the Triad concept explaining their catalytic specificity.									4	0	0	0	1	0	4			1742-464X	1742-4658		WOS:000549722800001	32627384

For domestic applications, the proton exchange membrane (PEM) process provides a safe and efficient way to split water into molecular hydrogen and oxygen but this technology, which requires platinum family electro-catalysts, remains too expensive. Molecular chemistry offers new opportunities for synthesizing alternative low-cost compounds, sufficiently stable in strong acidic media. In this paper, results obtained with different nickel and cobalt glyoximes are presented. They have been chemically (using U-V-visible spectroscopy) and electrochemically (using cyclic voltammetry and spectro-electrochemistry) characterized. Their ability to electroreduce protons into molecular hydrogen from aqueous acidic solutions is discussed, the compounds being either dissolved in solution or immobilized at the surface of a solid electrode using recast Nafion (R) films in view of PEM applications.

CHEMICAL GEOLOGY				252	3-4			109	124		10.1016/j.chemgeo.2008.01.019				JUL 15 2008	2008	Brine reaction processes were the most important factors controlling the major-ion (Mg, Ca, Na, K, SO4, and Cl) evolution of brines in the Oligocene, Mulhouse basin (France) evaporite basin. The combined analysis of fluid inclusions in primary textures by Cryo-SEM-EDS with sulfate-delta S-34, delta O-18 and Sr-87/Sr-86 isotope ratios reveals hydrothermal inputs and recycling of Permian evaporites, particularly during advanced stages of evaporation in the Salt IV member. The lower part of the Salt IV evolved from an originally marine input. The basin was disconnected from direct marine inputs and a series of sub-basins formed in an active rift setting where tectonic variations influenced sub-basin interconnections and chemical signatures of input waters. Sulfate-delta S-34 shows Oligocene marine-like signatures at the base of the member. However, enriched sulfate-delta O-18 reveals the importance of synchronous re-oxidation processes. As evaporation progressed other non-marine and/or marine-modified inputs from neighbouring basins became more important. This is demonstrated by increases in K concentrations in brine inclusions and Br in halite, sulfate isotopes trends and Sr-87/Sr-86 ratios. The recycling of previously precipitated evaporites of Permian age was increasingly important with evaporation. This supports the connection of the Mulhouse basin to basins situated north of Mulhouse.The brine evolution eventually reached sylvite precipitation. The chemical signature of the resulting brines is not compatible with global seawater chemistry changes. The fast rate of intra and inter basin brine variations as well as the existence of contemporaneous brines with different chemical signatures, supports our interpretation. The existence of diverse non-marine inputs and associated internal chemical changes to the brine preclude the use of trapped-brine inclusions in reconstructing Oligocene seawater chemistry, without previously identifying all inputs.The general hydrological evolution of the Mulhouse basin is explained as a restricted sub-basin with a first marine stage. This gradually changed to a similar to 40% marine source at the beginning of evaporite precipitation, with the rest of inputs non-marine. The general proportion of solutes did not change greatly over evaporite precipitation. However, as the basin restriction increased the originally marine inputs changed to continental or marine-modified inputs from neighbouring basins north of Mulhouse basin. (c) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

The mixture is excited by a 50-pulse burst from a repetitive nanosecond pulse discharge (NSPD) in a point-to-point geometry, operated at 100 kHz pulse repetition rate and 5 Hz burst repetition rate. One-dimensional radial distributions of temperature and species concentrations across the discharge filament, during and after the burst, are obtained from Rayleigh scattering and fluorescence images of the laser beam. Both temperature and species concentration profiles are found to expand with time, with peak centerline values of T-peak approximate to 1200 K, [H](peak) approximate to 6.0 . 10(15) cm(-3), and [OH](peak) approximate to 1.0 . 10(15) cm(-3). Secondary maxima in OH distributions are detected near the periphery of the filament after a few tens of discharge pulses. Experimental results are compared with predictions of a plasma chemical kinetics model. The model reproduces trends in temporal evolution of radial distributions of temperature, as well as OH and H concentrations. Based on a rate of species production analysis, the secondary peaks in OH radial distributions are found to be caused by radial diffusion of H atoms from the central region of the discharge filament, with subsequent formation of HO2 and OH via reactions H + O-2+ M -> HO2 + M and H + HO2 -> OH + OH in the low-temperature peripheral regions. The results demonstrate significant potential of the present approach for quantitative, time-and spatially-resolved studies of coupled radical reaction kinetics and diffusion over a wide range of temperatures, pressures, and mixture compositions.

Research on ternary compounds, such as LiCoO2, evolved into mixed-metal systems, notably Li(Ni,Mn,Co)O-2 (NMCs), which allows significant tuning of the physical properties. Despite their widespread application in commercial devices, the fundamental understanding of NMCs is incomplete. Here, we review the latest insights from multiscale modeling, bridging between the redox phenomena that occur at an atomistic level to the transport of ions and electrons across an operating device. We discuss changes in the electronic and vibrational structures through the NMC compositional space and how these link to continuum models of electrochemical charge-discharge cycling. Finally, we outline the remaining challenges for predictive models of high-performance batteries, including capturing the relevant device bottlenecks and chemical degradation processes, such as oxygen evolution.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			2380-8195			WOS:000769973900014

However, due to the lack of appropriate technology, dynamically observe the oxidation process remains an arduous task. Herein, the synergistic oxidation between edge and basal plane in molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) is observed through electrogenerated chemiluminescence (ECL) blinking with a millisecond resolution. In addition, the ECL method provides a simple, convenient, and quick way to judge structural changes. The transient elevation of the ECL intensity proved the intermittent doping of oxygen at MoS2, which generates O-atom active sites. High ECL intensity enhanced from the produced hydroperoxide intermediates eases the monitoring of MoS2 particles. Further study shows that the formation of sulfur vacancies at MoS2, by the edge activation of hydrogen peroxide and the migration of oxygen to the basal plane, is more conducive to oxygen doping that favors the formation of Mo-O-Mo as new active sites to induce bursts. The revealing of sulfur vacancy-governed blinking from MoS2 indicates a complex interaction between oxygen and MoS2. The same phenomenon is observed on tungsten disulfide (WS2), which provides new information about the oxidation feature of 2D dichalcogenides.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			0935-9648	1521-4095		WOS:000698848400001	34561901

The measurements were performed during the winter (December 2014 to February 2015), and comprised of two very distinct high and low aerosol loading periods coupled with prevalent foggy conditions. The average non-refractory submicron aerosol loading varied significantly from high (HL, similar to 240 mu g/m(3)) to low loading (LL, similar to 100 mu g/m(3)) period and was dominated by organic aerosols (OA) which contributed more than half (similar to 60%) of the measured aerosol mass. OA source apportionment via positive matrix factorization (PMF) showed drastic changes in the composition of OA from HL to LL period. Overall, O/C (oxygen to carbon) ratios also varied significantly from HL (=0.59) to LL (=0.69) period. Fog episodes (n = 17) studied here seem to be reducing the magnitude of the negative impact of OA loading on O/C ratio (OA loading and O/C ratio are anti-correlated, as higher OA loading allows gas to particle partitioning of relatively less oxidized organics) by 60% via aqueous processing. This study provided new insights into the combined effects of OA loading and fog aqueous processing on the evolution of ambient organic aerosols (OA) for the first time. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Pilgrim can also simulate reaction mechanisms using kinetic Monte Carlo (KMC).For reaction processes with many elementary steps, the rate constant of each of these steps can be calculated by means of conventional transition state theory (TST) or by using VTST. In the current version, Pilgrim can evaluate thermal rates using the canonical version of reaction-path VTST, which requires the calculation of the minimum energy path (MEP) associated with each elementary step or transition structure. Multi-dimensional quantum effects can be incorporated through the small-curvature tunneling (SCT) approximation. These methodologies are available both for reactions involving a single structure of the reactants and the transition state and also for reactions involving flexible molecules with multiple conformations of the reactant and/or of the transition state. For systems with many conformers, the program can evaluate each of the elementary reaction rate constants by multipath canonical VTST or multi-structural VTST. Moreover, the reactant can be unimolecular or bimolecular.Torsional anharmonicity can be incorporated through either the MSTor or the Q2DTor programs. Dual-level calculations are also available in Pilgrim: automatic high-level single-point energies can be used to correct the energy of reactants, transition states, products, and MEP points using the interpolated single-point energies (ISPE) algorithm.When the rate constants of all the chemical processes of interest are known, by means of their calculation using Pilgrim or alternatively through analytical fits to the rate constants as functions of temperature, it is possible to simulate a multistep mechanism under specified laboratory conditions using KMC. This algorithm allows performing a kinetic simulation to monitor the evolution of each chemical species with time and obtain the product yields.Program summaryProgram Title: PilgrimCPC Library link to program files: http://dx.doi.org/10.17632/24cj4dwxvg.1Developer's repository link: https://github.com/cathedralpkg/pilgrim/releases; https://comp.chem.umn. edu/pilgrim; https://conservancy.umn.edu/handle/11299/166578Licensing provisions: MITProgramming language: Python 3Nature of problem: Calculation of thermal rate constants for bimolecular and unimolecular chemical reactions and simulation of reaction mechanismsSolution method: The program uses variational transition state theory to calculate thermal rate constants and kinetic Monte Carlo to simulate reaction mechanisms.

Cadmium may induce cell death by apoptosis in various cell types, although the underlying mechanisms are still unclear. Nowadays, the cytotoxic potential of heavy metals is commonly evaluated by different cellular endpoints as reactive oxygen species formation, cell viability or cell death. Heavy metals cytotoxicity testing is based on in-vitro methods such as MTT assay, for the colorimetric detection of mitochondrial activity, propidium iodide-staining of DNA, as cell death marker, fluorometric detection of ROS generation to evaluate the stress response and colorimetric detection of cytokine secretion for the inflammatory reaction by ELISA method. In this work, we present a label-free digital holography (DH) based technique as an in-vitro cytotoxicity assay, which overcomes the limitations of conventional in vitro test based on color or fluorescence read outs. In particular, we show how DH is able to quantify the evolution of key biophysical parameters of cells during the exposure to cadmium. Murine embryonic fibroblasts NIH 3T3 are chosen here as cellular model for studying the cadmium effects. The results demonstrate that DH is able to retrieve the temporal evolution of different key parameters such as cell volume, projected area, cell thickness and dry mass, thus providing a full quantitative characterization of the cell physical behaviour during cadmium exposure. This demonstrates DH as an elegant label-free tool for heavy metals toxicity analysis.

Prussian blue analogs (PBAs) have recently been utilized to synthesize the corresponding derivatives with various functions because of their diverse geometries and tunable constituents. Herein, novel CoFeP nanocages are obtained from CoFe-PBA nanocube precursor via a facile phosphorization route. The porous hollow structure and unique multivoid interior provide exposed active sites and large surface area. For the CoFeP catalyst, both Co and Fe serve as active sites, and the synergism between them induces optimized electronic structure. The resulting CoFeP nanocages act as advanced OER catalyst in alkaline medium, delivering a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at a very low overpotential of 180 mV, a small turnover frequency of 0.93 s(-1) at the overpotential of 270 mV, and superior stability.									42	4	0	0	0	0	43			2052-1553			WOS:000461666900032

This study employs novel transmission X-ray microscopy to investigate the electrochemical reaction induced morphological and chemical changes in the Li-rich Li2Ru0.5Mn0.5O3 cathode particles at the meso to nano scale. Combined X-ray spectroscopy, diffraction and microscopy experiments are performed to systematically study this cathode material's evolution upon cycling as well as to establish a comprehensive understanding of the structural origin of capacity fade through 2D and 3D fine length scale morphology and heterogeneity change of this material. This work suggests that atomic manipulation (e.g. doping, substitution etc.) or nano engineering (e.g. nano-sizing, heterogeneous structure) are important strategies to mitigate the internal strain and defects induced by extensive lithium insertion/extraction.

Biomolecular emergence scenarios have proliferated in the literature but accounting for the ubiquity of oxidized (+5) phosphate (PO43-) in extant biochemistries has been challenging due to the dearth of phosphate and molecular oxygen on the primordial Earth. A compelling body of work suggests that exogenous schreibersite ((Fe,Ni)(3)P) was delivered to Earth via meteorite impacts during the Heavy Bombardment (ca. 4.1-3.8 Gya) and there converted to reduced P oxyanions (e.g., phosphite (HPO32-) and hypophosphite (H2PO2-)) and phosphonates. Inspired by this idea, we review the relevant literature to deduce a plausible reduced phospholipid analog of modern phosphatidylcholines that could have emerged in a primordial hydrothermal setting. A shallow alkaline lacustrine basin underlain by active hydrothermal fissures and meteoritic schreibersite-, clay-, and metal-enriched sediments is envisioned. The water column is laden with known and putative primordial hydrothermal reagents. Small system dimensions and thermal- and UV-driven evaporation further concentrate chemical precursors. We hypothesize that a reduced phospholipid arises from Fischer-Tropsch-type (FTT) production of a C8 alkanoic acid, which condenses with an organophosphinate (derived from schreibersite corrosion to hypophosphite with subsequent methylation/oxidation), to yield a reduced protophospholipid. This then condenses with an alpha-amino nitrile (derived from Strecker-type reactions) to form the polar head. Preliminary modeling results indicate that reduced phospholipids do not aggregate rapidly; however, single layer micelles are stable up to aggregates with approximately 100 molecules.									4	0	0	0	1	0	4			0169-6149	1573-0875		WOS:000674529400001	34279769

INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR SCIENCES				22	1					248	10.3390/ijms22010248				JAN 2021	2021	The negative impact that oxidative stress has on health is currently known. The complex mechanism of free radicals initiates a series of chain reactions that contribute to the evolution or development of different degenerative disorders. Likewise, these disorders are usually accompanied by inflammatory processes and, therefore, pain. In this sense, reactive oxygen species (ROS) have been shown to promote the nociceptive process, but effective treatment of pain and inflammation still represents a challenge. Over time, it has been learned that there is no single way to relieve pain, and as long as there are no other alternatives, the trend will continue to apply multidisciplinary management, such as promote the traditional use of the Erythrina genus to manage pain and inflammation. In this sense, the Erythrina genus produces a wide range of secondary metabolites, including flavanones, isoflavones, isoflavones, and pterocarpans; these compounds are characterized by their antioxidant activity. Phenolic compounds have demonstrated their ability to suppress pro-oxidants and inhibit inflammatory signaling pathways such as MAPK, AP1, and NF kappa B. Although there is preclinical evidence supporting its use, the pharmacological effect mechanisms are not entirely clear. Nowadays, there is a fast advancement in knowledge of the disciplines related to drug discovery, but most of nature's medicinal potential has not yet been harnessed. This review analyzes the decisive role that the Erythrina genus could play in managing inflammatory pain mediated by its compounds and its uses as an antioxidant.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0				1422-0067		WOS:000606657300001	33383701

The effects of temperature, current density, and mass concentrations of WC and CeO2 particles on the catalytic activity and corrosion resistance of the electrode were examined by analysis of the kinetic parameters of oxygen evolution and Tafel curves in a zinc-containing electrolyte comprising Zn2+ 65 g/L and H2SO4 150 g/L and by scanning electron microscopy. The optimal composite electrodeposition conditions were obtained as follows: CeO2 40 g/L and WC 20 g/L, temperature 60degC, and current density 25 mA/cm2. Under these conditions, a compact and uniform PbO2-WC-CeO2 composite electrode can be obtained on stainless steel substrate, featuring a exchange current density of 0.732 A/cm2 and a corrosion current density 3.924 times 10-5 A/cm2.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			1004-227X			INSPEC:13724860

Microstructure and corrosion behaviour are investigated using a variety of characterization techniques. The type H shows a better oxidation resistance than type I during annealing at relatively low temperatures. Nevertheless, residual strength of the type I annealed above 1000 degrees C is enhanced by healing of many micron-sized defects. Interfacial bond strength of the composites is reasonably improved after annealing. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.									26	2	0	0	0	0	27			0010-938X	1879-0496		WOS:000280272200012

The lack of an effective way capable of extensively and precisely modulating the allocation (e. g., the proportion, content and configuration) of heteroatoms in NHDG presents a substantial impediment. Herein, encouraged by our systematic theoretical result that optimizing the heteroatom allocation in graphene could significantly boost the HER performance, we regulate, for the first time, the proportion and content of heteroatoms in N, P codoped graphene (G-NP) accurately by a judiciously designed supramolecular architecture. The key to implementation lies in the well-built H-bonded supramolecular architecture (melamine-phosphoric acid)/graphene oxide assemblies, in which, during the pyrolysis, the architecture of melamine and phosphoric acid functions as not only a "spacer'' to suppress the stacking of graphene nanosheets, but also a self-sacrificial dopant for extensively tuning the allocation of N and P in a wide range. The optimal G-NP can acquire a moderate hydrogen adsorption Gibbs free-energy, an enhanced conductivity and a large electrochemical surface area, and display an extremely low overpotential of 106 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) in 0.5 M H2SO4 solution, ranking first in the reported NHDG catalysts and outperforming many state-of-the-art metallic catalysts. This work not only presents a cost-effective, efficient strategy to regulate the allocation of heteroatoms in doped graphene but also offers insight for better design and fabrication of advanced NHDG for different applications.									47	4	0	0	3	0	47			1754-5692	1754-5706		WOS:000486019600018

The deposition of cobalt phosphate (CoPi) onto photoanodes is an efficient approach to achieve high PEC efficiency. However, achieving performances at the required remains a huge challenge, owing to the passivation effect of CoPi. In this study, function-tunable strategy, whereby the passivation role is switched with the activation role, is exploited to modulate PEC performance through simultaneous activation of interface charge transfer and surface catalysis. By depositing nickel-doped CoPi onto a BiVO4 (BV) substrate, the integrated system (BV/Ni(1)Co(7)Pi) exhibits a remarkable photocurrent density (4.15 mA cm(-2)), which is a 4.6-fold increase relative to BV (0.90 mA cm(-2)). Moreover, the satisfactory performance can be also achieved on alpha-Fe2O3 photoanode. These findings provide guidance for improving the efficiency of CoPi on photoanodes for PEC water oxidation.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			1864-5631	1864-564X		WOS:000614026000001	33452868

Results demonstrate that the [Ru(II)bpy](5)[R111114p0M] modified electrode enables efficient water oxidation to be achieved at neutral pH using thin-film conditions, with [Ru(bpy)(3)](3+)([Ru(III)bpy]) acting as the electron transfer mediator and [(Ru4POM)-P-v] as the species releasing O-2. The rotating ring disc electrode (RRDE) method was used to quantitatively determine the turnover frequency (TOF) of the catalyst, and a value of 0.35 s(-1) was obtained at a low overpotential of 0.49 V (1.10 V vs Ag/AgCl) at pH 7.0. The postulated mechanism for the mediator enhanced catalytic water process in a pH 7 buffer containing 0.1 M LiCIO4 as an additional electrolyte indudes the following reactions (ion transfer for maintaining charge neutrality is omitted for simplicity): [Ru(III)bpy](5)[(Ru4POM)-P-III] -> [Ru(III)bpy](5)[(Ru4POM)-P-v] + 13 e(-) and [Ru(III)bpy](5)[(Ru4POM)-P-v] + 2H(2)O -> [Ru(III)bpy](5)[(Ru4POM)-P-IV] + 02 + 4H(+) The voltammetry of related water insoluble [Ru(II)bpy](2)[S2M18O62] (M = W and Mo) and [Fe(II)Phen](x)[(Ru4POM)-P-III] materials has also been studied, and the lack of electrocatalytic water oxidation in these cases supports the hypothesis that [Ru(III)bpy] is the electron transfer mediator and [(Ru4POM)-P-v] is the species responsible for oxygen evolution.									23	1	0	0	0	0	23			0020-1669	1520-510X		WOS:000339472000056	25000486

However, development of Si photocathodes that can operate at a high photocurrent density for solar-driven hydrogen production with long-term stability remains challenging. Herein, we report the fabrication of inverted pyramid textured p-Si photocathodes covered conformally and continuously with a thickness-gradient cobalt phosphide (Co2P) layer, which not only effectively isolates p-Si from aqueous electrolyte to avoid corrosion but also efficiently catalyzes the solar-driven hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Thanks to the unique inverted pyramid structure, the drop-cast Co2P can distribute all over the p-Si photocathode and form a macroscopically continuous but locally nonuniform layer on the sidewalls of each inverted pyramid. The local nonuniform distribution enables light absorption to be partially separated from catalytic activity. Consequently, the as-fabricated Co2P-coated p-Si photocathode exhibits a high photocurrent density of 35.2 mA cm(-2) at 0 V versus the reversible hydrogen electrode under AM 1.5G illumination and can photoelectrochemically catalyze the HER above 30 mA cm(-2) at least 150 h without notable degradation.									22	1	0	0	1	0	22			2380-8195			WOS:000475827900034

The evolution of land use in urban areas due to rapid development and the continuous problem of illegal discharge have had a serious adverse impact on the health of the country's waterways. Klang River requires extensive rehabilitation and remediation before its water could be utilised for a variety of purposes. A reliable and rigorous remediation work plan is needed to identify the sources and locations of streams that are constantly polluted. This study attempts to investigate the feasibility of utilising a temporal and spatial risk quotient (RQ) based analysis to make an accurate assessment of the current condition of the tributaries in the Klang River catchment area. The study relies on existing data sets on Biochemical Oxygen Demand (BOD), Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD), Total Suspended Solids (TSS), and Ammonia (NH3) to evaluate the water quality at thirty strategic locations. Analysis of ammonia pollution is not only based on the limit established for river health but was expanded to include the feasibility of using the water for water intake, recreational activities, and sustaining fish population. The temporal health of Kiang River was evaluated using the Risk Matrix Approach (RMA) based on the frequency of RQ > 1 and associated colour-coded hazard impacts. By using the developed RMA, the hazard level for each parameter at each location was assessed and individually mapped using Geographic Information System (GIS). The developed risk hazard mapping has high potential as one of the essential tools in making decisions for a cost-effective river restoration and rehabilitation. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Ripley, EM; Severson, MJ; Hauck, SA								Evidence for sulfide and Fe-Ti-P-rich liquid immiscibility in the Duluth Complex, Minnesota								ECONOMIC GEOLOGY AND THE BULLETIN OF THE SOCIETY OF ECONOMIC GEOLOGISTS				93	7			1052	1062		10.2113/gsecongeo.93.7.1052				NOV 1998	1998	Apatite- and oxide (ilmenite + magnetite)-rich dunite, pyroxenite, peridotite, melatroctolite, and gabbro occur as transgressive bodies in the Boulder Lake area of the southern Duluth Complex. Nelsonite (apatite + ilmenite) is locally found as vein or dikelike bodies whose geometric form resembles veinlike massive Cu-Ni sulfide mineralization in the Babbitt deposit. Massive sulfide mineralization at Babbitt has been attributed to the separation of an immiscible sulfide magma from a tholeiitic parent. Nelsonite contains assessory minerals such as Zn-rich hercynitic spinel, biotite, zircon, baddeleyite, and sulfide minerals. Massive sulfide mineralization at Babbitt is characterized by the presence of minor (1-10 vol %) amounts of euhedral apatite, as well as Fe-Ti oxides and the same assemblages of accessory minerals that is found in the nelsonite. Textures developed in the nelsonite, together with the unusual composition, are supportive of an origin involving Fe-Ti-P and S liquid immiscibility. Apatite from the nelsonites and related rocks contain very low REE and Cl contents relative to that in the massive sulfide. These data are thought to reflect the evolution of a Cl- and REE-bearing fluid from the magma that gave rise to the nelsonite and a later separation of an Fe-Ti-P-rich immiscible liquid in comparison to the early separation of an immiscible sulfide-rich liquid from a basaltic magma in the Babbitt area.Sulfur, oxygen, and hydrogen isotope data are not supportive of an origin for the apatite-oxide-rich racks that is linked to assimilation of metasedimentary country rock. However, elevated delta(18)O values (up to 13.2 in plagioclase) in many of the apatite-oxide-rich rocks, together viith anomalously high An content of plagioclase, suggest that subsolidus interaction with a Ca-rich fluid derived from dehydration reactions in the pelitic rocks of the Virginia Formation has been important.Although an origin involving immiscibility of an Fe-Ti-P-rich liquid is strongly indicated for the nelsonites, the origin of spatially associated apatite-oxide-rich rock types is problematic. The SiO2 content of most of the crosscutting bodies is less than 30 wt percent, and derivation by extreme closed-system fractional crystallization of a tholeiitic parent is considered unlikely due to predicted early saturation in Fe-Ti oxides. The oxide-apatite-rich rocks may themselves be products of liquid immiscibility, reflecting a continuum in compositions with nelsonite as an end member.									50	4	0	0	1	0	50			0361-0128			WOS:000077180400005

However, limited removal of chemical oxygen demand (COD) and long solid-liquid separation times are the key technical problems hindering its practical application. In this study, a persulfate-enhanced electro-coagulation system (PECS) was constructed to improve the removal of COD and shorten the settling time of the flocculation precipitates. Compared with the traditional electro-coagulation process, the PECS can improve the COD removal from 41.1% to 72.6% (60 min reaction and current density of 50 mA/cm(2)) using activated persulfate oxidation process. The PECS process involves the formation of sulfate and hydroxyl radicals as the main oxidants. The dissolved organic matter in the old landfill leachate mainly consisted of macromolecular humus-like substances. PECS can reduce the aromaticity and the complexity of organic matter, and generated small molecular-weight organic matter, which was helpful in further alleviating the pressure of subsequent treatment of the leachate. The evolution path of precipitates in PECS followed the process of alpha- FeOOH/Fe2O3 center dot H2O -> Fe3O4, which promoted the formation of Fe3O4, improved the precipitation performance, and reduced the volume of precipitates. PECS could improve the degree of degradation of organic matter, increase the removal of COD, and shorten the separation time of precipitates under similar treatment costs to conventional processes. The results of this study provide an important theoretical basis for improving the performance of existing electro-coagulation equipment in practical engineering applications.									11	0	0	0	4	0	11			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000707037200011

Here, we studied the stability and chemical evolution of sputtered Zr/Si multilayer during annealing at 600 degrees C and 800 degrees C in air to explore its potential application as protective coating for nuclear materials. At 600 degrees C after 20 h oxidation, only the top Zr layer was oxidized and the diffusion of Si into the buried Zr layers contributed to the formation of Zr3Si compound layer uniformly. At 800 degrees C, the first Zr layer and Si layer were oxidized into m-ZrO2 and amorphous SiO2 layer, respectively. Underneath these oxide capping layers, the Zr-Si compound layers near surface transformed into Zr-rich silicate layers with prolonged oxidation time. The continuous incorporation of Si into silicate layer triggered a reduction reaction to form Si-rich ZrSi2. Then, some silicon particles were formed through the de-alloying process of ZrSi2 and kept coherent interface with ZrSi2. These compounds were in situ formed in the original layer position, which maintained the multi-interface character. With further oxidation, this ZrSi2&Si layer was finally oxidized with self-healing ability.									5	1	0	0	0	0	6			0257-8972			WOS:000563807700075

The obtained Ti3C2@mNiCoP materials with a stable hierarchical sandwich structure possess excellent conductivity, large surface area, and uniform mesopores with high pore volume.

The results obtained with this equipment demonstrate non-monotonous character of the rate of red blood sedimentation and revealed several peculiarities of macroscopic stages and microkinetic of the process. Changes of biophysical-chemical state of blood related to changes in physiological state of a donor or under the action of different substances may result either in improving, or in worsening of studied parameters of blood sedimentation dynamics. A slight dilution of blood with saline in vitro leads as a rule to decreasing of sedimentation rate and improving of microkinetic parameters of the process of the red blood sedimentation. Adding of highly diluted hydrogen peroxide to blood samples of patients provides for the oxygenation of the system, and result in the improving of sedimentation dynamics: decreasing of average sedimentation rate and prolonging of macrokinetic states. The parameters of this reaction depend upon the metabolic potential of blood, the functional state of all its cellular and plasma elements, and in complex they reflect the physiological state of the individual. Any changes in parameters of macro-and microkinetics may reflect the pattern of oxygen release-delivery-consumption in blood. ESR-graphy may give much more information in comparison to the routine ESR-test and allows to consider blood sedimentation not from the viewpoint of separate physico-chemical parameters, but treating it as a metabolically active system.

The amorphous-to-crystalline transformation, the evolution of the nanocrystals, the sizes and their distribution, the surface characteristics, and the degree of oxidation as a function of annealing temperature are all determined from the Raman spectra. The changes in the Raman spectra between 100 and 200 cm(-1) represent the change in the oxidation state. The A(1g) mode, which is a signature of a crystalline SnO2 phase, is used to determine the nanocrystal sizes. The Raman spectra clearly reveal the gradual transformation of Sn(OH)(2) to SnOx and ultimately to SnO2 with annealing. The crystallinity and crystallite sizes are also confirmed with X-ray diffraction and transmission electron microscopy measurements. Furthermore, Raman spectroscopy is utilized to study the sensing response of the thus synthesized SnOx to NH3 gas and 2-nitrophenol. Raman spectroscopy is thus demonstrated to be a rapid and comprehensive technique to determine a multitude of parameters of tin oxide relevant for sensing applications. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Oxidative stress caused by oxygen free radicals is involved in the neuropathology of several neurodegenerative disorders, as well as in stroke and seizures. To evaluate the free radical metabolism in Rett syndrome, we measured red blood cell antioxidant enzyme activities (superoxide dismutase, glutathione peroxidase, glutathione reductase and catalase) and plasma malondialdehyde, as lipid peroxidation marker in a group of patients with Rett syndrome. No significant differences were observed in erythrocyte glutathione peroxidase, glutathione reductase and catalase activities, between the Rett syndrome patients and the control group. Erythrocyte superoxide dismutase activities were significantly decreased in Rett syndrome patients (P < 0.001) compared with the control group. Plasma malondialdehyde concentrations were significantly increased in Rett syndrome patients (P < 0.001). An unbalanced nutritional status in Rett syndrome might explain the reduced enzyme activity found in these patients. Our results suggest that free radicals generated front oxidation reactions might contribute to the pathogenesis of Rett syndrome. The high levels of malondialdehyde reflect peroxidative damage of biomembranes that may contribute to progressive dementia, impaired motor function, behavioural changes, and seizures, in Rett syndrome. We found a probable relationship between the degree of oxidative stress and the severity or symptoms, which should be further investigated with a larger number of patients in different disease stages.

The effect of varying heat treatment temperature on the structural and optical evolution of Ag nanoparticles in glass host is investigated using DSC, XRD, SEM, TEM, XPS and optical absorption methods. XRD patterns confirmed the amorphous nature of glass samples. SEM images indicated the uniform distribution of silver in glass matrix. TEM manifested the growth of silver nanoparticles with the increasing heat treatment temperature having the average diameter from 6 nm to 9 nm. The XPS photoelectron spectra of Ag 3d(5/2) band and Bi 4f bands indicated the redox reaction between Ag+ and low valence state bismuth ions during the heat treatment procedure. SPR band is observed in the region of 430-641 nm. Interestingly, the enhanced local electronic field aroused by the silver nanoparticles shifts the ultra-violet absorption cut-off edge to the lower wavelength sideband reducing the Urbach energy bands. The enhancement in concentration of bridging oxygen by the thermal oxidation of bismuth may be responsible for this change. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Micturition syncope can be caused by abnormal vasovagal response or by the dysfunction of the blood pressure regulating mechanism, which occurs before, during, or immediately after urination. Patient concerns: We present 4 cases of COVID-19 hospitalized in the Department of Infectious Diseases of the Academic Emergency Hospital Sibiu, Romania, cases that presented micturition syncope. Diagnoses: During hospitalization, patients confirmed with SARS-Cov-2 infection using real time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay, presented micturition syncope in different stages of the infection (at the beginning and in the second week of evolution). Interventions: Other causes of syncope such as adrenal insufficiency secondary to corticosteroids treatment, cardiac rhythm disorders, neurological impairment, dehydration, vasoactive medication, malignancies, pulmonary hypertension and coughing were excluded. The treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection was performed following the local and national guidelines. Outcomes: The clinical course of all 4 patients diagnosed with COVID-19 and micturition syncope was favorable. To our knowledge, micturition syncope in COVID-19 patients has yet not been reported by other authors. Lessons: To our knowledge, micturition syncope associated with the evolution of COVID-19, has yet not been reported by other authors.									4	0	1	0	3	0	5			0025-7974	1536-5964		WOS:000562693800118	32756188

Photocathodes based on nonoxide materials exhibit high solar-to-hydrogen conversion efficiencies thanks to their narrow bandgaps. However, the corrosion of photocathode surfaces at oxidative potentials and under highly alkaline conditions has resulted in insufficient durability. Here, the PEC properties of near-infrared-sensitive (ZnSe)(0.85)(CuIn0.7Ga0.3Se2)(0.15)-based photocathodes coated with a RuO2 nanolayer using a photo-electrodeposition method are investigated under harsh conditions. A RuO2-coated (ZnSe)(0.85)(CuIn0.7Ga0.3Se2)(0.15) photocathode exhibits no degradation during the PEC hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) at 0.6 V-RHE for longer than 10 h in electrolytes having pH values of 7 or 13. Maximum photocurrents of 9.1 and 2.9 mA cm(-2) are obtained at 0 and 0.6 V-RHE, respectively, under simulated sunlight without the use of any other HER catalyst or a conductor layer. This study therefore demonstrates a useful method for the fabrication of efficient, durable PEC cells using nonoxide photocathodes.									13	0	0	0	0	0	13			2366-9608			WOS:000432035000011

Using first-principles calculations, two-dimensional blue-phosphorene-phase GeX (X = S, Se) monolayers are systematically evaluated as photocatalysts for water splitting. Results show that the band edge positions of GeX locate outside the reduction potential of hydrogen and oxidation potential of water, and the values of bandgap fall into the ultraviolet range, suggesting that GeX would be served as an ultraviolet-driven photocatalyst. Interestingly, with the applying of tensile strain, the band edge positions are still suitable whereas the band gaps are significantly lowered to the visible range, and meanwhile, the intrinsic dipoles and concomitant electrostatic potential differences between Ge- and X-sides are greatly enhanced. In particular, at the 10% strain, the electrostatic potential difference reaches around 1.23 eV, which breaks the requirement of bandgap restriction for the conventional photocatalysts, thereby broadening the spectral range of light absorption from ultraviolet to visible. Using GeSe as an example, further calculations indicate that strain can enhance the optical absorption in the visible range and decrease the exciton binding energy. At the same time, the effective masses of carriers are not strongly affected by the strain. The increased internal electric field would act as an auxiliary booster to break up an exciton pair and inhibit the probability of electron-hole recombination. Moreover, strain can dramatically lower the free energy of two elementary steps of hydrogen evolution reaction. All these evidences confirm that GeX monolayers with a certain strain can serve as promising photocatalysts for water splitting under the visible range. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Geochemical data are consistent with its classification as an H5 ordinary chondrite. Several properties distinguish it from most other H chondrites. Its 10.7% porosity is predominantly macroscopic, present as intergranular void spaces rather than microscopic cracks. Modal mineralogy (determined via PS-XRD, element mapping via energy dispersive spectroscopy [EDS], and X-ray tomography [for sulfide, metal, and porosity volume fractions]) consistently gives an unusually low olivine/orthopyroxene ratio (0.67-0.76 for Mason Gully versus similar to 1.3 for typical H5 ordinary chondrites). Widespread silicate darkening is observed. In addition, it contains a bright green crystalline object at the surface of the recovered stone (diameter approximate to 1.5mm), which has a tridymite core with minor -quartz and a rim of both low- and high-Ca pyroxene. The mineralogy allows the calculation of the temperatures and integral(O-2) characterizing thermal metamorphism on the parent body using both the two-pyroxene and the olivine-chromite geo-oxybarometers. These indicate that MG experienced a peak metamorphic temperature of similar to 900 degrees C and had a similar integral(O-2) to Kernouve (H6) that was buffered by the reaction between olivine, metal, and pyroxene. There is no evidence for shock, consistent with the observed porosity structure. Thus, while Mason Gully has some unique properties, its geochemistry indicates a similar thermal evolution to other H chondrites. The presence of tridymite, while rare, is seen in other OCs and likely exogenous; however, the green object itself may result from metamorphism.									15	0	0	0	0	0	15			1086-9379	1945-5100		WOS:000372556800009

Hence, we rationally engineer novel CdS/Ti3+/N-TiO2 (TNTC) composite photocatalyst via integrating the evaporation induced self-assembly (EISA) and in-situ hydrothermal method. In the TNTC system, Ti3+/O-v and doped N respectively locate at below the conduction band (CB) and above the valence band (VB) of TiO2 to shorten the band gap from two inverse directions, thereby improving light utilization efficiency. The type II heterojunction TNTC with interfacial coupling effect can foster the spatial charge separation and the Ti3+ can form hydrogenation layer to reduce the activation barrier of H-2, which all can improve H-2 evolution capacity. Integrating with the above advantageous qualifies, the 10%CdS/Ti3+/N-TiO2 (TNTC10) has the best photo-catalytic H-2 evolution activity (1118.5 mu mol), which is about 15 and 40 times higher than that of CdS (71.6 mu mol) and Ti3+/N-TiO2 (TNT, 27.7 mu mol), respectively. Furthermore, we also test the photocatalytic activity of 10%CdS/N-TiO2 (NTC10) to facilitate comparison with TNTC10. Expectedly, the photocatalytic activity of TNTC10 is 6 times higher than that of NTC10 (178.3 mu mol), uncovering that the Ti3+ hydrogenated layer plays a pivotal role in boosting the efficiency of H-2 evolution. It is hoped that this work will provide a new cognitive perspective and understanding for building new-fashioned hydrogen evolution photocatalysts.									150	7	0	0	15	1	151			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000504405000102

As water inhibits Pd reoxidation during methane combustion, the catalysts were reduced prior to thein situXAS analyses to follow the evolution of the oxidized species. The contributions from metallic Pd, PdO and Pd(OH)(2)and metallic Co, Co(ii), and Co(iii) oxides were quantified as a function of temperature. The Pd-free sample showed remarkable stability of its species regardless of temperature in the dry feed but the presence of water inhibited its reoxidation. In a partially pre-reduced Pd/CoO(x)catalyst in the wet feed, cobalt species progressively oxidized to the level of the Pd-free sample. Pd remained largely unoxidized below the surface, with the Pd(0) fraction remaining stable in the studied 150-450 degrees C region. This was ascribed to the effect of the cobalt oxide support, as Pd(0) is known to oxidize progressively for alumina and tin dioxide supports in the wet feeds. We considered bulk thermodynamics of the involved processes, as well as the reported activation energies and kinetic data from a previous study on methane combustion. In combination with the results from thein situXAS, we suggest that cobalt oxide, being a preferential oxygen but unlikely hydroxyl acceptor, inhibits Pd oxidation, and does not provide benefits in terms of inactive Pd(OH)(2)formation.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			2044-4753	2044-4761		WOS:000547719400005

The silver diethyldithiocarbamate (AgDDTC) method provides the basis of a series of colourimetric tests used as a compromise between semi-quantitative field-test kits and expensive instrumental analytics. This study aimed at understanding the significant As overestimation by the AgDDTC method observed in landfill leachate samples. Results of the AgDDTC test were up to threefold the levels obtained by reference analyses. Overestimation broadly agreed with the time course of chemical oxygen demand and total phosphorus in the leachate. We hypothesised that the interference was caused by reduced P species or humic acid (HA), respectively. To test this, As-AgDDTC determinations from As standards were conducted with phosphonic (H3PO3) and phosphinic acid (H3PO2) as well as two commercial HA as matrix components. While H3PO3 showed no effect, H3PO2 in concentrations of 0.06 to 28mgPL(-1) yielded As recoveries of up to 130%. This was probably due to the evolution of phosphine (PH3) as suggested by the absorption spectra recorded after reacting pure PH3 with AgDDTC in pyridine. The HA in concentrations of 0.6-320mg dissolved organic carbon L-1 gave As recoveries of up to 600%, possibly due to a chromophoric reaction of volatile HA digestion products formed during the reduction step. Significant As overestimation in the presence of the above-named compounds may require pre-oxidation of the samples. To recognise interference effects, the acquisition of full absorbance spectra may be recommendable in lieu of fixed wavelength analyses.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0306-7319	1029-0397		WOS:000345839200013

Here, we have proposed Janus ScXY (X/Y = S, Se, or Te, X not equal Y) monolayers as promising catalysts for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). We have thoroughly investigated the structural stabilities of the ScXY monolayers, as a primary step to understand the splitting mechanism more accurately. It has been observed that Janus ScSSe and ScSeTe monolayers are dynamically, thermally and mechanically stable, whereas the ScSTe monolayer is dynamically unstable. Moreover, based on hybrid functional (HSE06) calculations, these stable ScSSe and ScSeTe monolayers are semiconductors with direct band gaps of 1.810 and 0.921 eV, respectively. Considering spin-orbit coupling on top of the HSE06 calculations results in an insignificant change in the band gaps. The steady optical responses of Janus ScSSe and ScSeTe, respectively, in the visible and near IR spectra demonstrate their photocatalytic activities in the respective regions. Interestingly, we have observed excellent performance shown by the ScSeTe monolayer, where both surfaces are catalytically active, and maintain close to thermoneutral conditions with near-zero adsorption free energy at different H* coverages. Comparatively, the ScSSe monolayer shows poor performance for the HER due to strong bonds with the adsorbed hydrogen. Also, it has been confirmed that even the application of +/- 2% strain on the ScSSe monolayer does not enhance its HER activity. Our theoretical predictions demonstrate that out of all the Janus ScXY monolayers studied here, ScSeTe is the most active catalyst for the HER to efficiently split water, which certainly could make it worth performing further experimental investigations.									25	1	0	0	1	0	24			2044-4753	2044-4761		WOS:000487788800012

Moreover, the features of ZnO can be easily tuned by changing the annealing temperature. The evolution of defects along with the increase of annealing temperature has been revealed as follows: the content of surface oxygen vacancy of the as-prepared samples first increases and then decreases, however, the content of impurities decreases gradually. A clear relationship between the defects and photoluminescence/photocatalytic characteristics of ZnO is observed. The defect-related emission mechanism of the visible photoluminescence (PL) for the as-prepared ZnO samples has been proposed. In addition, the samples also show good activities for photo-degradation of phenol under UV light irradiation. ZnO-500 degrees C (annealed at 500 degrees C) exhibits the best photocatalytic activity, which is superior to that of commercial ZnO. The photocatalytic activity can be greatly influenced by the relative concentration ratio of surface defects to bulk defects, crystallization performance and specific surface area.									235	4	0	0	13	1	236			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000341457000019

However, most of the g-C3N4-based heterojunctions still require the incorporation of noble metal co-catalysts for hydrogen evolution. Based on the excellent prolonged excited state lifetime, tunable optical properties, appropriate bandgap of conjugated polymer dots (Pdots) and unique few-layered g-C3N4 nanosheets with porous structures, in this study, polyfluorene Pdots are facilely coupled with g-C3N4 nanosheets to form organic heterojunctions. The poly(9,9-dioctylfluorene-alt-bithiophene) (F8T2) Pdots/g-C3N4 nanosheet heterojunctions can significantly extend the light-absorption range and promote the electron-hole pair separation, leading to an enhanced hydrogen evolution rate up to 929.3 mol h(-1) g(-1) with an apparent quantum yield of 5.7% at 420 nm without any metallic co-catalyst. This approach can provide a facile and operable fabrication technique for high performance photocatalysts, optical sensors and photoelectric devices in a sustainable way.									44	3	0	0	1	0	44			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000454251000022

Transition metal phosphides (TMPs) as co-catalysts for photocatalytic H-2 generation have been extensively employed due to their exceedingly good property, stability and low cost. Herein, a new photocatalyst containing g-C3N4 and porous network-like MoP as a highly efficient co-catalyst was fabricated. The maximal H-2-generation rate of the MoP/g-C3N4 photocatalyst could reach 327.5 mu mol.g(-1) h(-1), which was similar to 3.4 times higher than that of pure g-C3N4. The quantum efficiency achieved 9.6% at 400 nm. The improvement in photocatalytic H-2-generation of MoP/g-C3N4 was resulted from the proper Fermi level alignment and the close contact interfaces of porous network-like MoP and g-C3N4, in which MoP not only increased light absorption but also fasted the separation and transfer of photogenerated carriers as well as lowered the H-2 evolution overpotentials. The possible photocatalytical mechanism of the MoP/g-C3N4 photocatalyst was speculated based on various characterization techniques. It is believed that this study can offer a novel pathway to design highperformance and low-cost photocatalytic materials composed of metal phosphide co-catalyst for efficient watersplitting H2-generation over semiconductors under visible-light illumination.									105	11	0	0	10	0	105			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000447741800093

The model includes more than 600 processes involving electrons and 41 positive and 14 negative ions, including hydrated ions H3O+ (H2O) (n) and O (2) (-) (H2O) (n) with n = 1, 2, aEuro broken vertical bar, 12. The energy costs of production of electron-ion pairs and electronic and vibrational (for water molecules, also rotational) excitation of molecules are calculated in nitrogen, oxygen, water vapor, air, and humid air. A method is proposed for calculating the energy costs in mixtures by the calculation data in pure gases. The evolution of the plasma composition is studied by the numerical solution of a system of 56 time-dependent balance equations for the number of charged particles of plasma by the fourth-order Runge-Kutta method. The steady-state composition of plasma is determined by solving nonlinear steady-state balance equations for the ionization rates of humid air from 10 to 10(16) cm(-3)/s and the fraction of water molecules from 10(-3)% to 1.5%. It is established that, for water vapor content (the ratio of the number density of water molecules to the total number density of air molecules) of 0.015-1.5% in air at atmospheric pressure and room temperature, the main ion species are two types of positive ions H3O+ (H2O) (n) with the number of water molecules n = 5, 6 and three species of negative ions O (2) (-) (H2O) (n) with n = 5, 8, 9.									17	0	0	0	0	0	17			1063-7761	1090-6509		WOS:000411172600007

This new system is called an anaerobic electrochemical membrane bioreactor (AnEMBR). The Ni-HFM served the dual function as the cathode for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and the membrane for filtration of the effluent. The AnEMBR system was operated for 70 days with synthetic acetate solution having a chemical oxygen demand (COD) of 320 mg/L. Removal of COD was >95% at all applied voltages tested. Up to 71% of the substrate energy was recovered at an applied voltage of 0.7 V as methane rich biogas (83% CH4; < 1% H-2) due to biological conversion of the hydrogen evoked at the cathode to methane. A combination of factors (hydrogen bubble formation, low cathode potential and localized high pH at the cathode surface) contributed to reduced membrane fouling in the AnEMBR compared to the control reactor (open circuit voltage). The net energy required to operate the AnEMBR system at an applied voltage of 0.7 V was significantly less (0.27 kWh/m(3)) than that typically needed for wastewater treatment using aerobic membrane bioreactors (1-2 kWh/m(3)).									121	7	0	0	66	0	128			0013-936X	1520-5851		WOS:000344449100043	25310368

In this study, amorphous Co2P was decorated on Co-polyoxometalate (POM) and conductive cobalt phosphide forming integrated Co2P@ Co2P/Co-POM/NF electrode, through in suit growth, low-temperature phosphating and electrocatalytic self-adaption pathway by the stripping of superficial Co-POM when subjected to persistent bubbles. The fantastic design simultaneously offers excellent electrical conductivity for fast electron transfer, a large surface area with numerous active edge sites and a conductive current collector facilitating mass transfer and gas release. The electrode showed high catalytic activity, requiring overpotential of 130 mV for HER to achieve a current density of 50 mA/cm(2), 336 mV for OER to achieve a current density of 50 mA/cm(2), affording a water-splitting current density of 10 mA/cm(2) at a low cell voltage of 1.6 V. The results and facile synthesis method also offer an exciting avenue for the design of amorphous phase TMPs on a current collector with high specific area and excellent electrical conductivity for energy storage and conversion devices.

The phase composition, microstructure and ablation properties of the coating were studied by X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy/energy dispersive spectroscopy and oxyacetylene flame torch. The evolution of morphology and microstructure of HfC coating during the ablation were investigated. The ablation behaviors of HfC coating in different ablation regions were discussed. The results showed that multi-layered HfC coating with compact structures can be prepared on C/C composites by LPCVD. The as-prepared coating exhibits dense surface and excellent ablation resistance. After ablation for 240 s, three distinct regions appeared on the coating surface. In the center and transitional ablation regions, the coating surface is compact and consists of HfO2 grains. While in the border ablation region, the coating surface is porous. During the ablation, a porous structure is formed within the oxide layer, resulting from the release of CO and CO2. Both molten HfO2 film and HfCxOy can play a role as an oxygen diffusion barrier, which is the major reason for the excellent oxidation and ablation resistance of the HfC coating. In addition, large amounts of heat can be consumed by the oxidation of HfC and the evaporation of the oxide, which can further protect the C/C composites from ablation. (C) 2011 Elsevier BM.

Herein, a step-scheme heterojunction ZnO/COF(TpPa-Cl) is fabricated by a simple electrostatic self-assembly method, and its photocatalytic H2O2 production performance is also investigated. The S-scheme heterojunction between ZnO and TpPa-Cl contributes to enhanced light absorption, promoted reactant adsorption capacity, increased redox power, and efficient separation and transfer of photogenerated charge carriers, leading to an improved photocatalytic H2O2 evolution activity. The optimal composite possesses the maximum H2O2 evolution rate of 2443 mu mol.g(-1).h(-1) under simulated solar light irradiation, which is about 3.3 and 8.7 times higher than pristine ZnO nanoparticles and TpPa-Cl, respectively. Moreover, the charge transfer pathway in S scheme heterojunction photocatalysts is well elucidated. This investigation provides designing guidelines in the construction of other COF-based S-scheme heterojunctions.									4	1	0	0	0	0	5			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000800389600002

The linear and regular growth of the films characterized by cyclic voltammetry was observed. Atomic force spectroscopy (AFM) provides the surface morphology of the nanostructured Pt films. Rotating disk electrode (RDE) voltammetry and rotating ring-disk electrode (RRDE) voltammetry demonstrate that the MD-Pt overlayer/PtNPs films can catalyze an almost four-electron reduction of O-2 to H2O in air-saturated 0.1 M H2SO4. Thus-prepared Pt films behave as novel nanostructured electrocatalysts for dioxygen reduction and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) with enhanced electrocatalytic activities, in terms of both reduction peak potential and peak current, when compared to that of the bulk polycrystalline Pt electrode. Additionally, it is noted that after multiple replacement cycles, the electrocatalytic activities improved remarkably, although the increased amount of Pt is very low in comparison to that of pre-modified PtNPs due to the intrinsic feature of the UPD-redox replacement technique. In other words, the electrocatalytic activities could be improved markedly without using very much Pt by the technique of tailoring the catalytic surface. These features may provide an interesting way to produce Pt catalysts with a reliable catalytic performance as well as a reduction in cost.									39	2	0	0	4	0	39			1520-6106			WOS:000231178000012	16852933
