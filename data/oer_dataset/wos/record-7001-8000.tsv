Through electmless plating method, nickel borides grown on graphene, nickel foam (NF) , Ti mesh (TM) and carbon cloth (CC) were fabricated , in which graphene supported nickel borides exhibits homogeneous and dense nanoparticles structure. The oxygen evolution electrocatalytic performances of these materials are studied in alkaline solution (1.0 mol/L KOH). The results show that the nickel boride grown on graphene (NiBx/graphene) exhibits the best electrocatalytic performance for water oxidation. An overpotential of only 277 mV is needed to reach the current density of 10 mA/cm(2), and the corresponding Tafel slope are 57 mV/dec. The annealed sample shows an overpotential of 330 mV, which means an activity decline compared to the unannealed one. The NiB/graphene prepared by this facile method exhibits high electrocatalytic activity and stability, which provides new strategy for preparing high-performance and low-cost water oxidation electrocatalysts.									2	2	0	0	0	0	2			0251-0790			WOS:000600430400022

Co-based metal oxides are very promising candidates as high-performance oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalysts. Here, it is shown that chemical oxidation of layered P2-NaxCoO2 could lead to compositionally tunable P2-NaxCoO2 with high OER activity. The optimal electrocatalytic activity emerges in a narrow range of sodium concentrations with Na0.28CoO2 exhibiting the lowest over-potential of 350 mV at 10 mA/cm(2) and a Tafel slope of 29 mV/dec in 0.1 M NaOH electrolyte, outperforming the benchmark RuO2 catalyst and previous LiCoO2-based electrocatalysts. Electrochemical measurements and X-ray spectroscopic investigations reveal that chemically oxidized P2-NaxCoO2 catalysts are intrinsically active toward OER, arising from the abundant oxygen vacancies, increased Co-O covalency, and enhanced conductivity after deintercalation of the Na+. Our findings provide new insights into the design and synthesis of cost-effective catalysts toward efficient and durable OER. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

Herein, we report the preparation of bifunctional NiIrRuAl multimetallic nanoporous nanowires (NPNWs) with different compositions through the combination of metallurgical control and a two-step dealloying method. The synthesized NiIrRuAl NPNWs display ultrahigh OER and HER activities in acid solution. With a significantly reduced noble metal (Ir and Ru) content as low as 34 at%, the NiIrRuAl-1/3 electrocatalyst (Ir : Ru = 1 : 3) yields the best OER performance, showing an extremely low overpotential of 237 mV at 10 mA cm(-2), and the overpotential of the NiIrRuAl-3/1 electrocatalyst (Ir : Ru = 3 : 1) in the HER is only 14 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) in 0.1 M HClO4 solution. More significantly, the NiIrRuAl NPNWs only need a cell voltage of 1.464 V to reach 10 mA cm(-2) for overall water splitting and show excellent long-term stability.									23	0	0	0	1	0	23			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000527730400006

Surface engineering represents a facile approach to modify perovskites for enhanced performance. Through compositional design and in situ exsolution, a Ru-doped (La0.8Sr0.2)(0.9)Co0.1Fe0.8Ru0.1O3-delta (LSCFR) perovskite anchored with CoFe(Ru) alloy particles on the surface was fabricated for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in this work. Experimental results and calculations indicate that Ru-doping promotes the exsolution of CoFe(Ru) from the perovskite parent. Upon exsolution in the reduced atmosphere for 3 h, the catalyst (LSCFR-3) exhibited superior OER performance with an overpotential of 347 mV and a Tafel slope of 54.65 mV center dot dec(-1), and showed good stability in contrast to the pristine LSCFR. The exsolution of CoFe(Ru) particles, Ru doping, and the increase of surface oxygen vacancies are responsible for the enhancement of OER performance. The findings obtained in this study highlight the possibility of controlling exsolution and composition of nanoparticles by element doping and prove that in situ exsolution is an effective strategy for designing OER catalysts.									2	0	0	0	0	0	1			1998-0124	1998-0000		WOS:000788936500001

The ethanol oxidation reaction (EOR) is an innovative alternative anodic reaction to OER for improving the efficiency of water splitting to produce hydrogen. In order to improve the reactivity and explore the similarities and differences of active sites in the two reactions, three kinds of porous LDHs (NiFe, NiCo, CoFe LDHs) were synthesized and a series of tests were carried out. Among them, the best performing OER catalyst is NiFe-LDHs with a low overpotential of 1.44 V vs. RHE at 10 mA cm-2 anda Tafel slope of 23.85 mV dec-1. As for the EOR reaction, NiCo-LDHs is the best, with an overpotential of only 1.38 V vs. RHE at 10 mA cm-2 and a Tafel slope of 71.58 mV dec-1. In addition, compared with OER, the LHDs material exhibited better stability in the EOR. This work provides a new direction for studying the electrocatalytic activity of LDHs materials in OER and EOR.(c) 2022 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Herein, we report the use of a perovskite-oxide nanofilm as highly improved electrocatalyst for OER. A facile fabrication method, pulsed laser deposition (PLD), is employed for the first time to fabricate the SrCo0.85Fe0.1P0.05O3-delta nanofilm on nickel foam (SCFP-NF) with abundant active sites and enhanced electrical conductivity. We find that the SCFP-NF fabricated by PLD exhibits excellent OER activity and durability in alkaline solutions. Especially, the PLD method can create a large amount of oxygen vacancies on the surface of the perovskite nanofilm, leading to a high concentration of highly oxidative oxygen O-2(2-)/O-. This O-2(2-)/O- species is generally recognized to be active for OER. As a result, the SCFP-NF catalyst with low mass loading (similar to 30 mu g cm(-2)) demonstrates a remarkable OER activity with a low overpotential of 290 mV and a superb stability up to 200 h at 10 mA cm(-2) in alkaline media. The catalytic performance of this perovskite nanofilm is superior to most of the reported metal-oxide-based catalysts and benchmark RuO2. Our findings show that the catalytic performance of oxide-based electrocatalysts can be greatly improved by defect-engineering, and the PLD and other film fabrication methods may help us to realize practical application.									21	2	0	0	1	0	21			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000533148700049

Co3+(Oh) sites are the best geometrical configuration for OER. Co2+(Oh) sites exhibit better activity than Co2+(Td). Calculations demonstrate the conversion of O* into OOH* is the rate-determining step for Co3+(Oh) and Co2+(Td). For Co2+(Oh), it is thermodynamically favorable for the formation of OOH* but difficult for the desorption of O-2. Co3+(Oh) needs to increase the lowest Gibbs free energy over Co2+(Oh) and Co2+(Td), which contributes to the best activity. The coexistence of Co3+(Oh) and Co2+(Td) in Co3O4 can promote the formation of OOH* and decrease the free-energy barrier. This work screens out the optimal geometrical configuration of cobalt cations for OER and gives a valuable principle to design efficient electrocatalysts.									83	4	0	0	5	0	85			1433-7851	1521-3773		WOS:000510252700001	31883189

Recent studies show promising electrocatalytic activity of few-layered phosphorene sheets toward the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). However, controllable synthesis of mono/few-layered phosphorene nanostructures with a large number of electrocatalytically active sites and exposed surface area is important to achieve significant enhancement in OER activity. Here, a novel strategy for controlled synthesis and in situ surface functionalization of phosphorene quantum dots (PQDs) using a single-step electrochemical exfoliation process is demonstrated. Phosphorene quantum dots functionalized with nitrogen-containing groups (FPQDs) exhibit efficient and stable electrocatalytic activity for OER with an overpotential of 1.66 V @ 10 mA cm(-2), a low Tafel slope of 48 mV dec(-1), and excellent stability. Further, we observe enhanced electron transfer kinetics for FPQDs toward the Fe2+/Fe3+ redox probe in comparison with pristine PQDs. The results demonstrate the promising potential of phosphorene as technologically viable OER electrodes for water-splitting devices.									60	3	0	0	1	0	60			1936-0851	1936-086X		WOS:000451789200090	30362353

Ni nanowire arrays achieve low overpotentials of 112 and 347 mV for the hydrogen evolution reaction at current densities of 10 and 400 mA cm(-2), respectively, whereas ultralow overpotentials of 224 and 305 mV for the oxygen evolution reaction at current densities of 10 and 400 mA cm(-2), respectively, are achieved by NiFe/(Ni,Fe)(3)S-2 core/shell nanowire arrays. The pairing of the Ni nanowire array electrode as the cathode and the NiFe/(Ni,Fe)(3)S-2 core/shell nanowire array electrode as the anode, delivers current densities of 10 and 400 mA cm(-2) at ultralow cell voltages of 1.56 and 1.9 V, respectively, for the overall water splitting. The stability of the electrodes is also excellent, exhibiting only minor chronoamperometric decay after 24 h continuous operation at 400 mA cm(-2).

Water Splitting 71 highly active and stable electrocatalysts are the key to water splitting technology commercialization for hydrogen and oxygen production to replace Pt and IrO2 catalysts. Herein, a modified interface of palladium (Pd) and reduced graphene oxide (RGO)-supported molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) prepared by the solvothermal followed by chemical reduction method is established, in which abundant interfaces are formed. The phase structure, composition, chemical coupling, and morphology of the two-dimensional nanostructures are established by X-ray diffraction (XRD), Raman spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and transmission electron microscopy, respectively. A structural phase transformation in MoS2 is observed from trigonal (2H) to octahedral (1T) by virtue of Pd addition, which is well established from XRD, Raman, and XPS studies. For oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), the RGO/MoS /Pd (RMoS2Pd) catalyst exhibits extremely low overpotential (245 mV for OER and 86 mV for HER) to achieve benchmark current density, with small values of Tafel slope (42 mV dec(-1) for OER and 35.9 mV dec(-1) for HER) and charge transfer resistance. The quantitative study shows the hydrogen production rate of RMoS2Pd of 335 mu mol h(-1) with excellent stability in alkaline medium, which is superior to MoS2, RMoS2, and MoS2 Pd. The improved performance of RMoS2 Pd is attributed to the combined synergetic effect of IT MoS2, sulfur vacancy, and conducting RGO sheet, which efficiently accelerate the overall electrochemical water splitting.									34	3	0	0	1	0	34			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000497263600027	31621291

In this work, iron-doped nickel boride (FexNi1-xB) and nickel boride (NiB) were successfully grown on 3D self-supporting graphene (SSG) electrodes via a one-step reduction approach. The Fe0.2Ni0.8B/SSG electrode required a very low overpotential of only 263 mV for OER (the best OER activity achieved to date for a metal boride). NiB/SSG showed modest OER performance but excellent HER activity. A water electrolyzer comprising Fe0.2Ni0.8B/SSG and NiB/SSG delivered a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at a voltage of only 1.62 V. Further, the Fe0.2Ni0.8B/SSG and NiB/SSG catalysts showed excellent stability with no deactivation observed over 14 h of testing.

The synthetic approach begins with the preparation of Co(3)O(4)nanoparticles via a hydrothermal process, which is followed by a controlled hydrogen reduction treatment to render nanoparticles with radial constituents of Co3O4/CoO/Co (inside/outside). X-ray diffraction patterns confirm the formation of crystalline Co(3)O(4)nanoparticles, and their gradual transformation to cubic CoO and fcc Co on the surface. Images from transmission electron microscope reveal a core@shell microstructure. These Co3O4@CoO@Co nanoparticles show impressive activities and durability for OER. For ORR electrocatalysis, the Co3O4@CoO@Co nanoparticles are subjected to a galvanic displacement reaction in which the surface Co atoms undergo oxidative dissolution for the reduction of Pt ions from the electrolyte to form Co3O4@Pt nanoparticles. With commercial Pt/C as a benchmark, we determine the ORR activities in sequence of Pt/C > Co3O4@Pt > Co3O4. Measurements from a rotation disk electrode at various rotation speeds indicate a 4-electron transfer path for Co3O4@Pt.

Although considerable efforts have been devoted to the activity studies, little attention has been paid to the effects of different immobilization modes on reaction mechanisms. In this work, we studied the influence of covalent immobilization on the performance of Mn tetraphenylporphyrin in oxygen evolution (OER) and oxygen reduction (ORR) reactions. Ligation of the complex to carbon surface was attained via potentiostatic electroreduction of porphyrin diazonium salt with the following metalation and electrodeposition time was found to be a convenient tool to control the amount of electrochemically active catalyst on the electrode. Cyclic voltammetry suggests that the increase of porphyrin surface concentration upon prolonged electrodeposition shortens average Mn-Mn distance and proportionally enhances probability of at least two metal atoms simultaneously participating in a catalytic process. Optimization of organic layer density has profound effect on the catalyst performance in ORR in alkaline medium. 5 min electrodeposition furnishes the best catalyst, which features the 4-electron pathway being predominant at low overpotentials where the noncovalent counterpart shows selectivity to H2O of similar to 50%. What is more, overall catalytic current at -0.79 V vs NHE was 2.4 times higher for covalently immobilized porphyrinate. Electrokinetic measurements and impedance spectroscopy suggest that the reaction proceeds via formation of MnII intermediate with stepwise O-2 reduction to H2O2 and then to H2O. Similar effects were observed in acidic electrolyte. The OER rate is less sensitive to immobilization mode and mainly depends on the amount of accessible catalyst.									26	1	0	0	2	0	26			2168-0485			WOS:000459367400022

However, the identification and mechanism functions of polynary single-atom structures remain elusive. Atomically dispersed binary Co-Ni sites embedded in N-doped hollow carbon nanocubes (denoted as CoNi-SAs/NC) are synthesized via proposed pyrolysis of dopamine-coated metal-organic frameworks. The atomically isolated bimetallic configuration in CoNi-SAs/NC is identified by combining microscopic and spectroscopic techniques. When employing as oxygen electrocatalysts in alkaline medium, the resultant CoNi-SAs/NC hybrid manifests outstanding catalytic performance for bifunctional oxygen reduction/evolution reactions, boosting the realistic rechargeable zinc-air batteries with high efficiency, low overpotential, and robust reversibility, superior to other counterparts and state-of-the-art precious-metal catalysts. Theoretical computations based on density functional theory demonstrate that the homogenously dispersed single atoms and the synergistic effect of neighboring Co-Ni dual metal center can optimize the adsorption/desorption features and decrease the overall reaction barriers, eventually promoting the reversible oxygen electrocatalysis. This work not only sheds light on the controlled synthesis of atomically isolated advanced materials, but also provides deeper understanding on the structure-performance relationships of nanocatalysts with multiple active sites for various catalytic applications.									345	26	0	0	21	0	349			0935-9648	1521-4095		WOS:000491122900001	31617633

Although the Au-coated carbon electrodes are able to minimize side reactions arising from electrolyte decomposition, oxygen crossover on the lithium metal results in the formation of decomposition products (LiOH, Li2CO3) that are clearly detrimental for the battery performance. Finally it is demonstrated that the Au-coated carbon electrodes in combination with the LiTESI-Tetraglyme electrolyte can sustain extended cycling (100 cycles) when a more stable source of Li-ion, namely lithium iron phosphate (LFP), is used.

Since overvoltage reduces the overall efficiency of the water splitting device, lowering the overvoltage of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is the most important task in order to generate hydrogen more efficiently. Currently, noble metal catalysts show excellent characteristics in OER performance, but they are experiencing great difficulties in commercialization due to their high price and efficiency limitations due to low reactivity. In this study, a water electrolysis catalyst Ni-MWCNT was prepared by successfully doping Ni into the MWCNTs structure through the pulsed laser ablation in liquid (PLAL) process. High resolution-transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) were performed for the structure and chemical composition of the synthesized Ni-MWCNT. Catalytic oxygen evolution reaction evaluation was performed by linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) overvoltage characteristics, Tafel slope, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), cyclic voltammetry (CV) and Chronoamperometry (CA) was used for measurement.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1225-1429	2234-5078		WOS:000790079500004

ORR currents are measured with changing the vertical position of Pt/GCs, and OER currents are measured by linear sweep voltammetry. Based on the electrochemical results, it is found that thin liquid film on Pt/GCs effectively serves to expand TPB regions for ORR, but the liquid film hardly increases OER currents. Therefore, we conclude that the most effective TPB form are determined by the electrode reactions (ORR or OER), which are corresponding to discharge and charge processes for metal-air secondary batteries. In practice, it is strongly necessary to control the wettability of electrode inside, in order to construct high-performance bifunctional air electrodes. (C) 2015 The Electrochemical Society.

In this report, we show that nickel cobalt phosphite (NiCo-Phi) decorated with carbon nanotubes (CNTs) can perform as a bifunctional electrocatalyst for the oxygen evolution and oxygen reduction reactions (OER and ORR, respectively). The NiCo-Phi/CNT composite is synthesized by employing a simple, single-step hydrothermal method. The morphology of the composite consists of nanorod bundles of NiCo-Phi decorated with CNTs. The synthesized NiCo-Phi/CNT composite exhibits enhanced electrochemical OER activity with an overpotential of 400 mV at a current density of 10 mA/cm(2) and a Tafel slope value of 117 mV dec(-1) in 1 M KOH, possessing high stability towards the OER for 20 h. The ORR using the same catalyst shows an onset potential of 0.75 V and a Tafel slope of 100 mV dec(-1) in 0.1 M KOH with high-yield production of H2O2 (85 %). The predominant formation of H2O2 occurs mainly through a two-electron transfer process, as established by mass-controlled kinetic studies and has not been observed previously in these phosphorous oxy anion-based materials. The superior bifunctional nature of NiCo-Phi/CNT towards the OER and ORR arises from the synergistic effect of doped metal phosphites and CNTs.									9	1	0	0	0	0	9			2196-0216			WOS:000527708700001

Here we report a facile synthesis of nickel-based bimetallic electrocatalysts derived from 2D nanosheet-assembled nanoflower-like MOFs. The optimized morphologies and large Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface area endow FeNi@CNF with efficient OER performance, where the aligned nanosheets can expose abundant active sites and benefit electron transfer. The complex nanoflower morphologies together with the synergistic effects between two metals attributed to the OER activity of the Ni-based bimetallic catalysts. The optimized FeNi@CNF afforded an overpotential of 356mV at a current density of 10mAcm(-2) with a Tafel slope of 62.6mVdec(-1), and also exhibited superior durability with only slightly degradation after 24hours of continuous operation. The results may inspire the use of complex nanosheet-assembled nanostructures to explore highly active catalysts for various applications.									19	2	0	0	1	0	19			1861-4728	1861-471X		WOS:000470179400035	30919584

Herein, a binder-free and cost-effective Ni-Sb nanostructured catalyst was prepared using the one-step electrodeposition method from an organic solution, and its electrochemical characteristics for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in an alkaline medium were studied. The optimized Ni-Sb electrode demonstrated the best electrocatalytic activity for hydrogen and oxygen evolution reactions. Benefiting from the unique morphology, super-hydrophilic properties, and the synergistic effect between Ni and Sb elements, low overpotentials of 158 mV and 367 mV are needed to produce a current density of 10 mA.cm(-2) for HER and OER, respectively. Noteworthy, the Ni-Sb bifunctional catalyst displayed enhanced electrocatalytic stability at a current density of 100 mA.cm(-2) and works for 60,000 s. Our experimental data based on the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements before and after the stability test confirmed that the optimized electrode retains its catalytic performances for HER and OER owing to high conductivity and fast charge transfer. This study thus provides helpful avenues to design new antimonide-based catalysts for various applications.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1572-6657	1873-2569		WOS:000863042400006

Despite the fact that non-precious metal-based alkaline water electrocatalysts are receiving increased attention, noble metal-based electrocatalysts (NMEs) applied in proton exchange membrane water electrolyzers still have advantageous features of larger current and power densities with lower stack cost. Engineering NMEs for OER catalysis with high efficiency, durability and utilization rate is of vital importance in promoting the development of cost-effective renewable energy production and conversion devices. In this tutorial review, we covered the recent progress in the composition and structure optimization of NMEs for OER including Ir- and Ru-based oxides and alloys, and noble-metals beyond Ir and Ru with a variety of morphologies. To shed light on the fundamental science and mechanisms behind composition/structure-performance relationships and activity-stability relationships, integrated experimental and theoretical studies were pursued for illuminating the metal-support interaction, size effect, heteroatom doping effect, phase transformation, degradation processes and single-atom catalysis. Finally, the challenges and outlook are provided for guiding the rational engineering of OER electrocatalysts for applications in renewable energy-related devices.									292	12	0	0	14	0	292			0306-0012	1460-4744		WOS:000471797700002	31112142

Therefore, it is necessary to develop sustainable and clean energy sources. Electrocatalysts play an important role in the development of various new energy devices; in particular, high-efficiency and low-cost catalysts are essential for the large-scale application of these new devices. Among the many electrocatalysts, metal chalcogenides (sulfides, selenides, and tellurides) as emerging materials own abundant active sites and good electrical conductivity and are widely studied for their excellent electrocatalytic performances. This Perspective reviews the recent applications of metal chalcogenide materials in electrocatalysis, including hydrogen evolution reaction, oxygen evolution reaction, and electrolyzing water and specifically summarizes different optimization strategies and catalytic reaction mechanisms. The several regulation strategies include heteroatom doping, phase engineering, heterostructures, and hybrid materials, which are capable of improving conductivity, increasing active site exposure, and reducing the energy barrier of catalytic reactions to enhanced electrocatalytic performances. In Sec. IV, the existing problems and future challenges are proposed for the improvement of catalytic performance of metal chalcogenide materials, which provide an insight into and valuable guidelines for the future development of high-efficiency and low-cost electrocatalysts for new energy devices.

The coupling of outstanding oxygen evolution reaction (OER) active sites (oxides derived from Co-Fe nitrides) and superior oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) active centers (metal-N-C and graphitic N) to acquire high-performance and low-cost catalysts is an ideal solution. Herein, we have successfully combined cobalt-iron bimetallic nitrides with N-doped multi-walled carbon nanotubes (Co-Fe-N@MWCNT) as a robust bifunctional material. Benefiting from the synergistic effect between Co, Fe and MWCNTs, Co-Fe-N@MWCNT not only possesses large electrochemically active surface area and effective transport path, but also realizes the integration of superior OER and ORR active sites. Only a low overpotential (290 mV) is needed to achieve a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) for OER and the ORR catalytic activity is close to that of the commercial Pt/C. Additionally, Co-Fe-N@MWCNT as an ideal air electrode material can also be applied in Zn-air battery, which exhibits low voltage drop and favorable stability. The voltage gap has a slight change (about 0.03 V) even after 100 cycles of galvanostatic charge-discharge. More importantly, the synthetic strategy in our work may facilitate the design of more high-efficient bifunctional catalysts in various domains. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Yet still, it is far from expectation in practical applications due to entrapping within supports and blocking by aggregation. Herein, self-supported carbon nanosheet arrays consisting of single-atomic Co electrocatalyst (SS-Co-SAC) toward oxygen-involved reaction and zinc-air batteries are reported. Impressively, the as-synthesized SS-Co-SAC gives a markedly enhanced utilization of active sites (approximate to 22.3%@2.3 wt%) as a result of single-atomic dispersion of Co within a unique nanosheet arrays architecture, which is the largest value among other reported results. Benefiting from the high utilization of active sites, the SS-Co-SAC electrode exhibits outstanding electrocatalytic performance for both oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Notably, the turnover frequency value for ORR is determined to be approximate to 9.26 s(-1), which stands for the highest level among noble metal-free electrocatalysts reported previously. Moreover, as an air-cathode for zinc-air batteries with SS-Co-SAC, a power density of 195.1 mW cm(-2) and a robust durability are achieved. It is believed that this study would guide the future design of highly active and durable single-atom catalysts for both fundamental research and practical applications.									58	6	0	0	5	0	59			1616-301X	1616-3028		WOS:000516567900027

Herein, we have demonstrated that the morphology and conductivity of FeNi3 alloy can be finely tailored via introducing the graphene carbon dots (GCDs). Benefitting from the enlarged active areas, significantly improved electrical conductivity, and strong synergistic coupling effect, the optimized FeNi3@GCDs(-10) shows extraordinary electrocatalytic performance towards OER by delivering a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) with the overpotential of 238 mV, as well as small Tafel slope of 48.7 mV dec(-1). Density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that Fe is the dominated active sites for boosting water dissociation. In addition, the incorporation of GCDs can also strength the adsorption of *O and lower the energy barrier for the transformation from *OH to *O, thereby optimizing the free energy of *O and greatly promoting the OER activity.

However, bulk CoS2 sheets have limited catalytic activity due to low exposure of active sites. Herein, through an in-situ vulcanization approach, CoS2 nanoparticles are embedded into bipyridine-containing covalent organic polymer (BP-COP). The as-prepared nanocomposite CoS2@BP-COP exhibits high catalytic activity toward OER with an ultra-low overpotential of 270 mV (vs. RHE) at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2), a small Tafel slope of 36 mV dec(-1), and an excellent durability for 24 h without decay. The surface of CoS2 is partially converted into CoOOH to form CoS2/CoOOH as active sites under OER conditions. CoS2@BP-COP displays superior OER catalytic activity to CoS2 nanosheets and commercially available RuO2 under the same conditions. The outstanding OER performance activity of CoS2@BP-COP could be attributed to the uniform and small particle sizes of CoS2/CoOOH distributed in BP-COP.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			1861-4728	1861-471X		WOS:000689680000001	34448347

Herein, the Ru cluster anchored on a trace P-doped defective TiO2 substrate (Ru/P-TiO2) was synthesized as an electrocatalyst for the HER; it exhibited a commercial Pt/C-like geometric activity and an excellent mass activity of 9984.3 mA mg(Ru)(-1) at -0.05 V vs. RHE, which is 34.3 and 18.7 times higher than that of Pt/C and Ru/TiO2, respectively. Experimental and theoretical studies indicated that using a rutile-TiO2-crystal-phase substrate enhanced the HER activity more than the anatase phase. Rich surface oxygen vacancies on rutile-TiO2 facilitated the adsorption and dissociation of water, while the partial substitution of Ti4+ with P5+ enhanced H-2 generation by facilitating hydrogen spillover from the Ru site to the surface P site, synergistically enhancing the HER activity.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1433-7851	1521-3773		WOS:000871723400001	36164268

Herein, Zn-doped CoS2 nanoarrays supported on carbon cloth, Co(Zn)S-2/CC, are fabricated through a facile sulfidization of CoZn metal-organic frameworks. This precatalyst, Co(Zn)S-2/CC, with a well-defined nanoarray structure affords excellent OER catalytic activity (eta = 248 mV at 10 mA/cm(2)) and long-term durability in 1 M KOH. X-ray photoelectron and in situ Raman spectroscopic studies indicate that Co(Zn)S-2 undergoes surface reconstruction with the generation of Co(Zn)OOH adsorbed with SO42- at the surface during the OER process. The Zn dopant is calculated to impact on the electronic structure of Co species and further the adsorption of intermediates. This work not only provides a novel method for the synthesis of bimetallic sulfides but also gives insights into the doping effect on the OER performance of transition metal sulfides.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000787374700025	35302344

In this work, the self-supporting amorphous NiFeCoP catalyst with nanoporous structure via a facile electrochemical dealloying method is reported. Benefiting from the bicontinuous nanostructure, disordered atomic arrangement, abundant active sites and synergic effect of various transition metals, the as-prepared nanoporous NiFeCoP (np-NiFeCoP) catalyst exhibits good electrocatalytic activity, which achieves the current densities of 10 mA cm(-2) at low overpotentials of 244 mV and 105 mV for OER and HER in 1.0 M KOH, respectively. In addition, the bifunctional electrocatalyst also shows outstanding and durable electrocatalytic activity in water splitting with a small voltage of 1.62 V to drive a current density of 10 mA cm-2 in a two-electrode electrolyzer system.

Scarcity of fresh water resources promotes the search for electrode materials, which could be used for splitting of saline water into hydrogen and oxygen without formation of hazardous chlorine compounds, and also withstand highly aggressive chloride medium. In the present study we demonstrate that nickel oxide layer formed by means of simple spray-pyrolysis technique on conductive glass substrate can be used as corrosion resistant and 100% O-2-selective anode for the electrolysis of alkaline (pH 14) chloride solution. Dimensional stability and durability of the anode is secured by the absence of metallic phase, whereas selectivity towards oxygen evolution and absence of chloride oxidation is shown to be controlled thermodynamically. The obtained experimental evidence that hydrogen peroxide is formed as intermediate in oxygen evolution reaction under conditions investigated has led to new mechanistic insights and the mechanism of Ni(IV)-mediated electrocatalytic oxidation of water molecules in alkaline chloride medium has been proposed.

As a promising H-2 production route, electrolysis of water suffers from high overpotentials and high energy consumption. This study proposes an N-doped CoP as the novel and effective electrocatalyst for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and constructs a coupled system for simultaneous hydrogen and sulfur production. Nitrogen doping lowers the d-band of CoP and weakens the H adsorption on the surface of CoP because of the strong electronegativity of nitrogen as compared to phosphorus. The H adsorption that is close to thermos-neutral states enables the effective electrolysis of the HER. Only -42 mV is required to drive a current density of -10 mA cm(-2) for the HER. The oxygen evolution reaction in the anode is replaced by the oxidation reaction of Fe2+, which is regenerated by a coupled H2S absorption reaction. The coupled system can significantly reduce the energy consumption of the HER and recover useful sulfur sources.									251	11	0	0	12	0	254			0935-9648	1521-4095		WOS:000436930800016	29774606

Herein, we review recent breakthroughs in the design of metal alloy-based nanostructures for oxygen electrocatalysis, placing particular emphasis on how alloy structure and complex architecture influence electrochemical performance. Emerging design principles for alloy-based catalysts include composition regulation, size optimization, morphology control, structure engineering, and interface engineering. By employing one or more of these five design principles, a wide range of alloy systems have been successfully developed in recent years that offer superior ORR and OER activity and stability relative to the benchmark Pt/C and IrO2 or RuO2 electrocatalysts traditionally used in these reactions. Further, many of these well-engineered alloy catalysts offer outstanding electrochemical performance as cathode catalysts in PEMFCs or air electrode catalysts in rechargeable metal-air batteries (e.g., Zn-air and Li-air batteries), thus enabling lower cost fabrication of these devices.									23	1	0	0	2	0	23			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000590158400004		
J	Cooper, Ian B.; Barry, Bridgette A.								Perturbations at the chloride site during the photosynthetic oxygen-evolving cycle								PHOTOSYNTHESIS RESEARCH				92	3			345	356		10.1007/s11120-007-9147-3				JUN 2007	2007	Photosystem II (PSII) catalyzes the oxidation of water to O-2 at the manganese-containing, oxygen-evolving complex (OEC). Photoexcitation of PSII results in the oxidation of the OEC; four sequential oxidation reactions are required for the generation and release of molecular oxygen. Therefore, with flash illumination, the OEC cycles among five S (n) states. Chloride depletion inhibits O-2 evolution. However, the binding site of chloride in the OEC is not known, and the role of chloride in oxygen evolution has not as yet been elucidated. We have employed reaction-induced FT-IR spectroscopy and selective flash excitation, which cycles PSII samples through the S state transitions. On the time scale employed, these FT-IR difference spectra reflect long-lived structural changes in the OEC. Bromide substitution supports oxygen evolution and was used to identify vibrational bands arising from structural changes at the chloride-binding site. Contributions to the vibrational spectrum from bromide-sensitive bands were observed on each flash. Sulfate treatment led to an elimination of oxygen evolution activity and of the FT-IR spectra assigned to the S-3 to S-0 (third flash) and S-0 to S-1 transitions (fourth flash). However, sulfate treatment changed, but did not eliminate, the FT-IR spectra obtained with the first and second flashes. Solvent isotope exchange in chloride-exchanged samples suggests flash-dependent structural changes, which alter protein dynamics during the S state cycle.									10	0	0	0	8	0	10			0166-8595	1573-5079		WOS:000248806500007	17375370

This material is also an excellent catalyst for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), what leads to an extraordinary reversible behavior (Delta E = E-OER E(ORR=)480 mV), being an economic and easy scalable candidate for the air electrode of metal-air batteries or for electrochemical devices where the oxygen evolution or the oxygen reduction is involved. In the present research, Fe partially replaces Co atoms in the Co3O4 spinel structure to obtain a more economically feasible material, leading to a FeCo2O4/CNF, by using an electrospinning preparation procedure previously adopted for the Co3O4/CNF synthesis. The substitution of iron in the Co3O4/CNF spinel entails an outstanding onset potential toward the OER of 1.36 V vs. reversible hydrogen electrode, which is 120 mV lower compared with the pure spinel (Co3O4/CNF). An optimal distribution of the FeCo2O4 particles on the CNF surface, with 3-nm-size particles, allows exposing abundant active sites, mainly Co3+ and Fe3+, responsible for the enhanced activity toward the OER, and Fe-N-x moieties and N sites (N-graphitic/pyridinic), more active for the ORR. Besides, FeCo2O4/CNF shows a well-developed porous structure, favoring the mass transfer, a parameter particularly important for the ORR. To assess the stability of the catalysts for rechargeable alkaline metal-air batteries, cycling operation and chronopotentiometric experiments are carried out, showing a stable potential for 24 h.

Initially dopamine incorporated two dimensional Co3O4 aggregates are prepared using wet chemical method and subsequently annealed at two different temperatures namely 200 degrees C and 400 degrees C. Depending upon the annealing temperature, resultant materials showed varied structural morphology which influences their electrocatalytic behaviour. Electrocatalytic activities of two important reactions associated with water splitting reaction namely OER and HER are systematically investigated by grafting such materials onto Ni foam. Among the two, CoDA-400 sample exhibited higher bifunctional activity for OER and HER applications when compared to CoDA-200. Interestingly, CoDA-400 displays a lower overpotential of 378 mV for obtaining 100 mA/cm(2) current density towards OER and shows a lower overpotential of 147 mV for obtaining 10 mA/cm(2) current density towards HER enabling its potential use as a promising bifunctional electrocatalyst. Moreover, this particular material exhibits appreciable long-term stability for both these electrocatalytic processes. The difference in catalytic activity is assigned to the presence of oxygen vacancies, doped graphene like structures and Co-N bonds present in the resultant product.									10	0	0	0	0	0	10			2365-6549			WOS:000441542300027

The sluggish kinetics of oxygen reduction reaction(ORR)and oxygen evolution reaction(OER)hinder the development of these clean energy technologies. Although noble metal catalysts are considered superior, they have apparent disadvantages, such as poor durability, low selectivity, and high cost. The determination of noble metal-free catalysts has become a trend in related researches. As an emerging class of polymer materials linked by special covalent bonds, covalent organic frameworks(COFs)demonstrate advantages of tunable structure, low density, high stability, and large specific surface area. COFs are widely considered as promising electrocatalysts that can be gradually applied utilizing reasonable design strategies. Herein, this review aims to research 2D COFs suitable for ORR, OER, and bifunctional electrocatalysis in recent years and primarily introduces the strategies of pristine COF as an electrocatalyst, composite structure formation, and pyrolysis. The key factors for forming electrocatalytic active centers or improving electrocatalytic activity have been summarized from the molecular design and electronic tuning aspects, which are expected to serve as a reference in future works.			在碳达峰、碳中和的目标之下,燃料电池、金属-空气电池、电解水等清洁能源技术提高了能源利用率,在未来将成为新的能源消费方式。氧还原反应(ORR)、氧析出反应(OER)因其缓慢的动力学过程而导致此类清洁能源技术的发展受到阻碍。贵金属催化剂虽被认为是最高效的催化剂,但其成本高、稳定性低,寻找非贵金属催化剂已成为相关研究的趋势。共价有机框架材料(COFs)作为一类新兴的材料,由有机单体通过特殊的共价键连接而成,因其具有可调控的结构、低密度、高稳定性、较大比表面积等独特的优点,通过合理的设计策略,将其应用于电催化剂的研究在近年来逐步兴起。本文回顾了近期适用于ORR、OER及ORR/OER双功能电催化的二维COFs(2D COFs)材料,主要介绍了以纯COFs作为电催化剂、COFs与其他材料形成复合结构、COFs热解碳化等策略制备高效电催化剂,并从分子设计及电子调控等层面上梳理了上述策略对电催化活性中心的形成或电催化活性提升的原因,对当前存在的问题提出总结,以期在今后的研究中起到一定借鉴意义。						0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2095-4239			CSCD:7147747

Herein, a general, selenic-acid-assisted etching strategy is designed from a metal-organic framework as a precursor to realize carbon-coated 3d metal selenides MmSen (Co0.85Se1-x, NiSe2-x, FeSe2-x) with rich Se vacancies as high-performance precious metal-free oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrocatalysts. Specifically, the as-prepared Co0.85Se1-x@C nanocages deliver an overpotential of only 231 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) for the OER and the corresponding full water-splitting electrolyzer requires only a cell voltage of 1.49 V at 10 mA cm(-2) in alkaline media. Density functional theory calculation reveals the important role of abundant Se vacancies for improving the catalytic activity through improving the conductivity and reducing reaction barriers for the formation of intermediates. Although phase change after long-term operation is observed with the formation of metal hydroxides, catalytic activity is not obviously affected, which strengthens the important role of the carbon network in the operating stability. This study provides a new opportunity to realize high-performance OER electrocatalysts by a general strategy on selenic acid etching assisted vacancy engineering.									56	3	0	0	3	0	56			0935-9648	1521-4095		WOS:000624634100001	33656778

In this review, general concepts of the photosynthesis in green plants are discussed, different strategies for the light-driven water splitting proposed in laboratories are introduced, the progress of electrocatalytic hydrogen and oxygen evolution reactions are reviewed, and finally, the reactions in hydrogen fuel cells are briefly discussed. Overall, the mass and energy circulation in the solar-hydrogen-electricity circle are delineated. The authors conclude that attention from scientists and engineers of relevant research areas is still highly needed to eliminate the wide disparity between the aspirations and realities of artificial photosynthesis.									299	18	0	0	21	0	300			1614-6832	1614-6840		WOS:000425113600008		
J	Lv, Xingshuai; Wei, Wei; Wang, Hao; Huang, Baibiao; Dai, Ying								Holey graphitic carbon nitride (g-CN) supported bifunctional single atom electrocatalysts for highly efficient overall water splitting								APPLIED CATALYSIS B-ENVIRONMENTAL				264						118521	10.1016/j.apcatb.2019.118521				MAY 5 2020	2020	Downsizing metal-based catalysts to construct single atom catalysts (SACs) is currently an emerging focus in research community of electrocatalysis, however, encountering the common aggregation of metal sites. Herein, the catalytic performance of holey g-CN supported SACs (Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co and Ni) toward hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) are evaluated. Co-1/g-CN and Ni-1/g-CN are identified as the most efficient bifunctional single atom catalysts for overall water splitting, capable of driving HER/OER simultaneously with overpotentials being as low as 0.15/0.61 V and 0.12/0.40 V, outperforming the commercial Pt and IrO2. Remarkably, the d band centers of TM atoms can act as an efficient descriptor for the interaction strength between intermediates and TM/g-CN, which can be tuned to further optimize the catalytic activity. This work heralds a new family of bifunctional single atom electrocatalysts for overall water splitting, elucidating a useful guideline for designing advanced SACs.									72	1	0	0	1	0	72			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000515195200042

In this aspect, a facile hydrothermal route was developed to prepare nonprecious metal electrocatalysts including pristine MoO3 rods, nanospheres, and their hybrids with reduced graphene oxide (rGO). This is the first report of the use of rGO coupled with hexagonal MoO3 nanocrystals that act as both ORR and OER catalysts. The rGO-MoO3 sphere hybrid catalyst exhibited excellent catalytic activity toward both the ORR and OER compared to pristine MoO3 rods, MoO3 spheres and rGO-MoO3 rods. In addition, the rGO-MoO3 nanosphere hybrid exhibited excellent catalytic activity, long-term durability, and CO tolerance compared to a high quality commercial Pt/C catalyst. This makes the GMS hybrid composite a highly promising candidate for high-performance nonprecious metal-based bi-functional electrocatalysts with low cost and high efficiency for electrochemical energy conversion. The enhanced activity of the rGO-MoO3 nanosphere hybrid is due mainly to the enhanced structural openness in the tunnel structure of the hexagonal MoO3 when it is coupled with rGO.									45	0	0	0	1	0	46			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000382110200031

This model is based upon the oxygen transfer mechanism and uses physically meaningful parameters that are directly comparable to the experimental and theoretical literature of the carbon-oxygen reaction system. The model was used to extract reaction parameters for NBG-18 polycrystalline graphite for oxygen/nitrogen mixtures with a total pressure of 100 kPa. Experimental temperatures ranged from 500 to 850 degrees C for oxygen partial pressures of 1, 5, 10, 20, and 40 kPa. The optimized model parameters are in good agreement with previously reported literature values. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

In this work, a simple and eco-friendly method which involves a sol-gel pretreatment on multiple precursors and subsequent pyrolysis is designed to synthesize Co nanoparticles embedded and nitrogen-doped porous carbon (Co@NC). The sol-gel pretreatment ensures the high dispersion of all precursors, which is beneficial to the formation of uniform and highly dense active sites. After pyrolysis, acid treatment removes the unencapsulated Co nanoparticles on the surface to form porous structure and increase the mass activity. Benefiting from the synthetic strategy, the porous Co@NC-850 with large surface area, high density of active sites (graphitic N, pyridinic N and Co-N-x) exhibits comparable oxygen reduction performance (E-1/2 = 0.85 V vs. reversible hydrogen electrode) to that of commercial Pt/C and better oxygen evolution activity (with an overpotential of 350 mV at 10 mA cm(-2)) with respect to RuO2. The potential gap Delta E (between the oxygen evolution potential at 10 mA cm(-2) and oxygen reduction E-1/2) for Co@NC-850 is only 0.73 V. Compared with the state-of-the-art bifunctional oxygen electrocatalysts, Co@NC-850 shows obvious advantages in bifunctional activity and durability. The results in the present work will shed light on the development of other carbonaceous materials as the bifunctional oxygen electrocatalysts for energy storage and electrochemical devices.

Different kinds of suitable materials can be synthesized by varying MOF templates/precursors and synthesis methods. An appropriate method can skillfully fabricate the materials with excellent performance while meeting the environmentally friendly concept. In this work, a green and flexible grinding method was introduced to synthesize MOF-derived FeNiCo trimetallic materials without solvent-assistance, in which Co-ZIF-L was selected as a sacrificial precursor and Fe3+ and Ni2+ as etchants and dopants. Surprisingly, the as-prepared FeNiCo ternary hydroxides supported on Ni foam (G-FeNi-Co-ZIF-L/NF) showed superior electrocatalytic performance for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) with a low overpotential of 248 mV at 10 mA cm(-2). This work provides a prospective approach to synthesize various MOF-derived multi-metallic materials, which also opens the door for syntheses of OER electrocatalysts.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			1864-5631	1864-564X		WOS:000705507300001	34510784

Benefiting from the dual-modified electronic structure of the surface active sites of NiFe-LDHs, the as-obtained catalyst showed excellent electrocatalytic activity for the OER, only demanding a low overpotential of 259 mV to achieve 10 mA cm(-2) in 1.0 M KOH.									15	0	0	0	0	0	15			2052-1553			WOS:000503509100025

X-ray diffraction, field-emission scanning electron microscopy, cyclic voltammetry, and linear scanning voltammetry were used to scrutinize the electrodes and the electrochemical activity. The results indicate that highly ordered TNTs with large specific surface area could be implanted with active metal oxides. The catalyst firmly binds with the TNTs and enhances the electrochemical stability of the electrode. It displays high over-potential for oxygen evolution reaction. Accordingly, the constructed (Ru0.3Ti0.34Sn0.3Sb0.06)O-2-TNTs anode exhibits a greater potential difference (Delta E) between the evolutions of oxygen and chlorine than that exhibited by the traditional dimensionally stable anode, which is beneficial for improving the selectivity toward chlorine evolution reaction. This superior performance is explained in terms of the surface properties and geometric structure of coated catalyst, as well as the electrochemical selectivity ascribed by the addition of tin and antimony species.									25	3	0	0	2	0	27			0021-891X	1572-8838		WOS:000322136500010

Herein, we account the fabrication of a kind of Fe/Co/N-codoped catalysts (CoFe-COFbpda/CNT-X) derived from bimetallic COFs/carbon nanotube composites toward both oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The bipyridine were optioned and indited in the COFs to anchor metal ions (Fe), which can effectively keep back the migration and aggregation of metal ions during pyrolysis. The obtained CoFe-COFbpda/CNT-700 exhibits higher ORR catalytic performance, with half-wave potential reaches 0.862 V and the limiting current density is 5.12 mA cm(-2) in 0.1 M KOH solution. For OER, the CoFe-COFbpda/CNT-700 at the current density of 10 mA cm(-2) is as low as 1.67 V and smaller Tafel slope compared to most oxygen electrocatalysts in 0.1 M KOH solution. Furthermore, the application of CoFe-COFbpda/CNT-700 as the air cathode in Zinc-air battery displays outstanding property and enhanced cycling stability compared with Pt/C-IrO2.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2199-692X			WOS:000855459000001

Herein, a simple one-step method is developed for carbonizing the metal precursors and dicyandiamide to prepare CoNi/MoC nanoparticles incorporated into N, Pcodoped carbon nanotubes-on-nanosheets (CoNi/MoC-NP-CTS). Benefiting from the unique sheet-like architectures with regular nanotubes and the synergistic effect of multi-components, the resultant CoNi/MoC-NP-CTS shows the positive half-wave potential of 0.89 V (vs. RHE) and small Tafel slope of 51.1 mV dec(-1) for ORR, coupled by the enhanced OER performance with an overpotential of 335 mV at 10 mA cm(-2). More notably, the CoNi/MoC-NP-CTS-based Zn-air battery exhibits largely higher power density (132 mW cm(-2)) than commercial Pt/C + RuO2-based battery (80 mW cm(-2)), together with the outstanding cycling durability (480 cycles, 160 h).

Transition metal sulfides and carbon materials provide broad platforms for design of highly active electrocatalysts thanks to their flexibility, high electrical conductivity, and possessing various catalytically active sites towards different reaction systems. Herein, a ternary-component MoS2-Co9S8-NC nanohybrid is synthesized, in which Co9S8, MoS2, and N-doped carbon (NC) are integrated with each other. Owing to forming abundant varied active centers including Co9S8-MoS2 heterojunctions, and Co-N, Mo-N coupling centers locating at the contact interfaces between transition metal sulfides and N-doped carbon, the hybrid demonstrates greatly enhanced performances towards hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Such hybrid represents low overpotentials of 95 mV and 230 mV to achieve 10 mA cm(-2) current density for HER and OER in 1.0 M KOH, respectively, and demonstrates favorable prospects for large-scale applications in overall water splitting.

The LSMC-Ru exhibits outstanding bifunctional activity with a low potential gap of 0.72 V between the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) potential at 10 mA cm(-2) and the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) half-wave potential. The strong electronic interaction between RuOx and LSMC is confirmed by both experiments and theoretical calculations. Consequently, the electron-rich Mn centers promote ORR, while the electron-deficient Ru centers facilitate OER. A Zn-air battery using the LSMC-Ru air electrode delivers a peak power density of 159 mW cm(-2) and a low charge-discharge potential gap of 0.58 V at 2 mA cm(-2). The high round-trip energy efficiency of 60.6% is retained after 300 cycles.

High-performance catalysts based on earth abundant components are therefore a prime research theme. Herein, we report the development of a series of novel composites based on nanostructured iron-doped CoWO4 particles electrically linked to conductive carbon nanotubes (CNTs) using a facile one-pot hydrothermal method. It is shown that tuning of the iron content of Co1-xFexWO4-CNT composites (x=0-1) allows structural and reactivity control. The Co1-xFexWO4-CNT composites are active and stable OER and ORR electrocatalysts, and follow the Sabatier principle. For Co0.5Fe0.5WO4-CNT, minimum overpotentials of eta=290 mV and low Tafel slopes of 42 mVdec(-1) are achieved at a current density of j=10 mAcm(-2) for OER, and the Co0.5Fe0.5WO4-CNT shows high catalytic activity for ORR with half-wave potential of 0.74 V. As such, the composites show high potential as OER and ORR electrocatalysts, so that technologically viable, noble-metal-free, tunable electrocatalysts with relevance for alkaline water electrolysis can be designed from the bottom up.									14	1	0	0	0	0	14			2196-0216			WOS:000446066100019

Herein, a sequence of Fe and V dual metal-doped mesoporous cobalt oxide (FeV/meso-Co) electrocatalysts was successfully synthesized through citric acid-assisted evaporation-induced self-assembly (EISA) method. The textural, morphological, crystallinity, and electrochemical activities of Fe/V-promoted meso-Co (124 m(2)/g) are found strongly associated with dual (Fe and V) metal concentration. Benefiting from the combined effect of FeV-doping, the FeV/meso-Co exhibited an extremely lower overpotential of 280 mV to reach 10 mA/cm(2) for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in 1M KOH electrolyte, which was the considerably lowest value among the earlier catalysts, and the FeV/meso-Co showed similar features as IrO2 electrodes. Furthermore, FeV/meso-Co electrodes display highly durable (>30 hours) electrocatalytic performance for OER.

Here, we demonstrate that the lattice oxygen of MnXn-1O2 MXenes can be activated by 0D graphene quantum dots (GQDs), thereby activating the OER via the lattice-oxygen oxidation mechanism (LOM) instead of the conventional adsorbate evolving mechanism. The pH-dependent OER activity of MnXn-1O2@GQDs and O-18 isotope-labelling experiments with time-of-flight secondary-ion mass spectrometry (TOF-SIMS) provide the direct evidence of LOM. Interestingly, the activated lattice oxygen amount can be controlled by the GQDs. The as-prepared 0D/2D Ti3C2O2@GQDs heterostructure delivers a highly reduced overpotential of 390 mV (bare Ti3C2O2: 530 mV) at a benchmark current density of 10 mA cm(-2). Through optimizing the thickness and the additional conductive substrate, the overpotential at 10 mA cm(-2) decreases to 250 mV, while the Tafel slope is reduced to 39 mV dec(-1); these values indicate the as-prepared heterostructure is superior to the state-of-the-art MXene-based OER catalysts.

Herein, we show a facile strategy to significantly enhance the electrocatalytic activity and stability of crystalline alpha-FeOOH by rapid heat treatment. We identify that crystalline alpha-FeOOH shows not only electrocatalytic activity as high as the benchmark FeOOH catalyst (amorphous gamma-FeOOH), but also the highest stability among all FeOOH electrocatalysts for the OER in alkaline solutions. Our findings not only deepen the fundamental understanding of the OER process on these materials but also guide further development of new low-cost electrocatalysts for energy storage via water splitting.									115	6	0	0	4	0	116			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000395074300025

The frequency (f), duty cycle (dc), current density (i), and electrodeposition time (sum of t(on)s) were chosen as the parameters of the pulse electrodeposition method. The analyses of variance (ANOVA) were performed on the responses of the designed experiments that included the required overpotential at the current density of 10 mA/cm(2) for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) (eta(10,HER) and eta(10,OER)), active surface area (R-f) and intrinsic electrocatalytic activity (i/R-f). The results indicated that eta(10,HER), eta(10,OER,) and R-f are mainly influenced by duty cycle and electrodeposition time, while i/Rf is affected by frequency and time. The optimized NiSe2 electrode synthesized under optimal conditions of pulse electrodeposition (low duty cycle and prolonged electrodeposition time) showed the most desirable values for eta(10,HER), eta(10,OER), and R-f, equal to 44 mV (vs. RHE), 235 mV (vs. RHE) and 14700, respectively. The nanostructured NiSe2 demonstrated the highest potential in the bifunctional application of OER and HER. (C) 2021 Elsevier Inc.

The capacity and cyclability of Lithium-oxygen battery increase with the nitrogen content to a vertex, then decrease with higher nitrogen content. The largest capacity of 7250 mA g(-1) and the best long-term stability of 71 cycles over 420 h are found in a catalyst with proper content of nitrogen.

Here we demonstrate a bifunctional ultrathin Ni2P nanosheet electrocatalyst through a microwave-assisted method and phosphorization process. The as-prepared Ni2P nanosheets present low overpotentials (eta(10)) of 96 and 255 mV for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution (OER) at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2)in a basic medium. Remarkably, the overall water splitting electrolyzer exhibits a low cell voltage of 1.47 V to achieve a current density of 10 mA cm(-2)in 1 M KOH with outstanding stability. Our facile and unique synthetic protocol and highly active material will open the avenue for further application of water splitting devices.									8	1	0	0	0	0	8			2398-4902			WOS:000573449300037

When the composite is used as both anode and cathode catalyst for overall water splitting, it requires low voltages of 1.57 and 1.66 V to provide a current density of 100 mA cm(-2) in alkaline freshwater and simulated seawater, respectively, exhibiting no obvious attenuation over a 50 h test. Operando Raman spectroscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy indicate that NiOOH2-x active species containing high-valence Ni3+/Ni4+ are in situ generated from NiCx during the water oxidation. Density functional theory calculations combined with ligand field theory reveal that the role of high valence states of Ni is to trigger the production of localized O 2p electron holes, acting as electrophilic centers for the activation of redox reactions for oxygen evolution reaction. After hydrogen evolution reaction, a series of ex situ and in situ investigations indicate the reduction from Fe3+ to Fe2+ and the evolution of Ni(OH)(2) are the origin of the high activity.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2				2198-3844		WOS:000773181600001	35338616

The OER involves a multiple proton-coupled electron transfer process, which leads to the sluggish kinetic reaction. Searching for highly efficient route to synthesize electrocatalysts for OER is significant for developing sustainable energy systems. Herein, the 2D ultrathin cobalt-manganese layered double hydroxides (CoMn-LDHs) nanosheets with a typical hydrotalcite structure are prepared by a specific reduction-oxidation method. Particularly, the Co8Mn2LDH electrocatalyst exhibits the highest activity along with a large surface area of 276.9 m(2)/g among different Co/Mn ratios of the CoMn-LDHs. The as-prepared Co8Mn2-LDH shows an overpotential as low as 307 mV at the 10 mA/cm(2) current density and a small Tafel slope of 86 mV/dec. The Co8Mn2-LDH still maintains a satisfactory durability after a long-term continuous measurement. Such excellent electrocatalytic performance may be attributed to the huge surface area and the unique layered structure, which will do favor to the charge transport between the interface of solution and catalyst. Therefore, the reduction-oxidation method provides a highly efficient route to synthesize LDHs for OER.									12	2	0	0	1	0	13			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000595143300004

After uptake SeO(3)(2-)by Co-MOF, the recycling defect-rich CoSeO4 (R-CoSeO4) is used as an electrocatalyst for oxygen evolution reaction (OER), which displays an overpotential of 265 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) in 1 M KOH. Furthermore, cobalt-cobalt selenide heterojunction nanoparticle (Co-Co0.85Se), a high-performance hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) electrocatalyst (over -potential of 97 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) in 1 M KOH) is obtained by one-step calcining of R-CoSeO4. Series experiments and density functional theory calculations confirm the anion vacancy in R-CoSeO4 and heterojunction in Co-Co0.85Se can improve the OER and HER activity, respectively. Finally, two binder-free electrodes (R-CoSeO4/CC and Co-Co0.85Se/CC) are employed as anode and cathode, respectively, to construct a water electrolysis cell, which only needs 1.47 V to achieve 10 mA cm(-2) in 1 M KOH.									2	0	0	0	1	0	2			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000773514300002

In particular, Na-O-2 batteries with superoxide as the discharge product have a very high round-trip energy efficiency over lithium-air batteries due to their significantly reduced charging overpotential. However, Na-O-2 batteries yet suffer from limited cycling lives because of the formation and incomplete removal of side products during oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) processes, while the mechanism of these processes is still not fully understood. Herein, a detailed investigation on tracking the decomposition pathway of cubic-shaped micrometer-sized NaO2 discharge products in Na-O-2 batteries with carbon-based air electrodes is reported. A detailed electrochemical charging mechanism is revealed during the charging process. The evolution of the chemical compositions of the discharge/side products in air electrode during charging is also verified by synchrotron-based X-ray absorption spectroscopy experiments. The formation of these intermediate phases other than NaO2 during the charging process results in high overpotentials. These new findings can contribute to a better understanding and the rational design of future Na-O-2 batteries.									27	4	0	0	0	0	28			1616-301X	1616-3028		WOS:000463732400013

These catalysts may be classified into three groups, with different rate laws associated with O-2 evolution. In one class, O-2 evolution proceeds via radical coupling of the oxygen atom of an Ru-V=O species with a hydroxocerium(IV) ion. O-2 evolution catalyzed by the second class occurs via acid-base reaction of the oxygen atom of an Ru-V=O species with a water molecule. In the third group, the dominant mechanism is oxo-oxo radical coupling between two Ru-V=O species. Several significant properties of the oxidant Ce(IV) are also discussed, including the singlet biradical character of the hydroxocerium(IV) ion.									7	0	0	0	0	0	7			0922-6168	1568-5675		WOS:000345091500002

Herein, we have successfully integrated multiple strategies into one catalytic system for further enhancing the OER performance. A series of hollow Co3O4 dodecahedrons with controlled crystal orientation and oxygen vacancies were prepared by using ZIF-67 as a precursor and adjusting the atmosphere during calcination. Hollow Co3O4 dodecahedrons with both controlled exposure of the (111) facets and high content of oxygen vacancies showed an excellent OER performance with an overpotential of 307 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) and a Tafel slope as low as 55 mV dec(-1) and significantly superior to its counterpart with low content of oxygen vacancies or a broken Co3O4 dodecahedron being ground and losing the preferred facets of (111). The excellent OER performance should be attributed to the unique hollow structure and the effective control of the (111) facets and oxygen vacancies, which allows for more highly active sites and enhanced conductivity.									8	0	0	0	1	0	8				2052-1537		WOS:000604916500011

Herein, we present a one-step sulfurization method to fabricate Ni3S2 nanowires directly grown on Ni foam (Ni3S2 NWs/Ni) as such an electrocatalyst. This synthetic strategy has several advantages including facile preparation, low cost and can even be expanded to large-scale preparation for practical applications. The as-synthesized Ni3S2 NWs/Ni exhibits a low overpotential of 81 and 317 mV to render a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) for the HER and OER, respectively, in 1.0 mol l(-1) KOH solution. The Ni3S2 NWs/Ni was integrated to be the cathode and the anode in the alkaline electrolyzer for overall water splitting with a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) afforded at a cell voltage of 1.63 V. More importantly, this electrolyzer maintained its electrocatalytic activity even after continual water splitting for 30 h. Owing to its simple synthesis process, the earth-abundant electrocatalyst and high performance, this versatile Ni3S2 NWs/Ni electrode will become a promising electrocatalyst for water splitting.									34	3	0	0	2	0	35			0957-4484	1361-6528		WOS:000430330800002	29543594

Here we report an active cobalt boride (CoB)-derived electrocatalyst for both oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). The CoB catalyst can be readily deposed on 3D nickel foam (NF) using a simple electroless plating method. A comprehensive analysis of the CoB catalyst with scanning electron microscopy transmission (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), Raman spectroscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) techniques revealed that CoOOH is formed on the surface of CoB catalyst during the OER process and Co(OH)(2) is formed in the HER process. The catalyst derived from CoB/NF exhibits low over potentials towards both OER and HER in alkaline solution. The electrolysis cell using the CoB-derived catalyst couple requires a cell voltage of 1.69 V to afford a current density of 10 mA/cm(2), which compares favorably with most non-noble bifunctional electrocatalysts. The favorable combination of high-performance, low cost and facile preparation suggests that transition metal borides may act as promising electrocatalyst for water splitting.

Herein, we report a spontaneous gas-foaming method to prepare nitrogen doped ultrathin carbon nanosheets (NCNs) by simply pyrolysing a mixture of citric acid and NH4Cl. Under the optimized pyrolysis temperature (carbonized at 1000 degrees C) and mass ratio of precursors (1:1), the synthesized NCN-1000-5 sample possesses an ultrathin sheet structure, an ultrahigh specific surface area (1793 m(2) g(-1)), and rich edge defects, and exhibits low overpotential and robust stability for the ORR, OER and HER. By means of density functional theory (DFT) computations, we revealed that the intrinsic active sites for the ORR, OER and HER are the carbon atoms located at the armchair edge and adjacent to the graphitic N dopants. When practically used as a catalyst in rechargeable Zn-air batteries, a high energy density (806 W h kg(-1)), a low charge/discharge voltage gap (0.77 V) and an ultralong cycle life (over 330 h) were obtained at 10 mA cm(-2) for NCN-1000-5. This work not only presents a versatile strategy to develop advanced carbon materials with ultrahigh specific surface area and abundant edge defects, but also provides useful guidance for designing and developing multifunctional metal-free catalysts for various energy-related electrocatalytic reactions.									736	50	0	0	39	0	743			1754-5692	1754-5706		WOS:000457194500021

The nanoporous Ni-Fe alloy displays an improved electrochemical performance by exhibiting an OER current density of 100 mA/cm(2) at 442 mV overpotential in the 1 M KOH aqueous solution, which is better than that of laser processed bulk Ni-Fe alloy (464 mV). The structures, crystallinities, and chemical compositions of the nanoporous Ni-Fe electrocatalyst are characterized by SEM, XRD and EDXS. With an activity comparable to the electrocatalysts reported to date, the monolithic nanoporous Ni-Fe electrodes are also highly flexible in mechanical configurations, due to the combined advantages of both laser and dealloying processes, which provide new options for OER electrode design.

In this study, rich oxygen vacancy was introduced in Bi7O9I3 microsphere (Bi7O9I3-OVR) via a facile ionic liquid assisted solvothemal method to investigate the charge separation and photocatalytic performance. To demonstrate the dominant role of the introduced oxygen vacancy, partial oxygen vacancy in Bi7O9I3 microsphere was repaired by post-calcination treatment (Bi7O9I3-OVL), which was confirmed by electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR). The experimental results indicated the introduction of oxygen vacancy boosted the holes mobility and electrons reduction of Bi7O9I3, then the increased charge carriers' separation efficiency and high concentration of produced reactive oxygen species was realized. Benefiting from these, the Bi7O9I3-OVR microsphere exhibited a better photocatalytic oxygen evolution performance than Bi7O9I3-OVL, and the oxygen evolution rate was up to 2.66 mu mol m(-2) h(-1).

Herein, we propose a bifunctional oxygen electrocatalyst derived from a bimetal-organic framework. Two-dimensional (2-D) CoNi-BDC (BDC = benzenedicarboxylic acid) was synthesized via an bottom-up approach (improved inter-diffusion route). Lamellar CoNi nanoalloys embedded in N-doped carbon nanofibers (CoNi-N-CNFs) were obtained by electrospinning CoNi-BDC and dicyandiamide (DCD) into a polyacrylonitrile (PAN) polymer and subsequent post-calcination treatment. By taking advantage of the synergetic interac-tions between CoNi nanoalloys and N-doped carbon, the as-synthesized CoNi-N-CNFs catalysts exhibited outstanding catalytic performance with respect to the OER and ORR. CoNi-N-CNFs-60 exhibited a low overpotential of 229 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) and a half-wave potential of 0.823 V in 1 M KOH, making it a promising candidate as an efficient air electrode in Zn-air battery. The hierarchical 1-D/2-D composite structure and porous morphology play a key role in improving electrocatalytic performance by exposing a greater number of active CoNi-N sites.

Therefore, the development of efficient, abundant and economical catalysts for water oxidation reaction is one of the main subjects of present study in renewable energies. This review article summarizes the very recent efforts in the field of OER electrocatalysis along with the faced challenges. The solutions to these challenges also outline with appropriate examples of scientific literatures. Significantly, the present review will provide the standards to evaluate the activity and stability for heterogeneous OER catalysts. It will clearly summarize the future directions and applications, especially the combination of sustainable energy utilization (like triboelectric nanogenerator) with water splitting. The providing study will help to explore and develop better catalysts and units for practical applications and will offer basic understanding of OER process along with the standard parameters to evaluate the performance.									912	42	0	0	26	1	920			2211-2855	2211-3282		WOS:000402704500017

Herein, we have designed a unique architecture where carbon nanotubes (CNTs) are supported on an oxide template. NiCo encapsulated N-doped carbon nanotubes were grown vertically outward from the nickel-cobalt oxide flowers for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). The hybrid shows enhanced water oxidation performance (321 mV at 10 mA/cm(2)) and decent ORR activity (E-1/2 at 0.75 V vs RHE) due to better conductivity and a large electrochemical surface area. Enhanced OER activity can be ascribed to high Ni and Ni3+ content whereas improved ORR activity results from enhanced active nitrogen species (pyridinic, M-N-x and graphitic) and higher water contact angle (due to unique architecture). Further, reversible oxygen electrochemistry with & UDelta; E = 0.80 V indicates its potential as a bifunctional electrocatalyst. The hybrid electrocatalyst has shown good operational stability and durability for OER and ORR. Finally, the practical feasibility as cathode catalyst for metal-air battery has been demonstrated by powering a light emitting diode.									6	0	0	0	2	0	6			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000780376000001

In this work, novel Co9S8 nanoparticles/N,S-codoped defect-rich carbon nanotubes (Co9S8/N,S-CNTs) were fabricated by an ingenious template method. CdS nanowires, as a sacrificial template, can be removed simultaneously during the carbonization process without additional post-treatments. The large BET surface area (661.2 m(2) g(-1)) and pore volume (1.49 cm(3) g(-1)) of Co9S8/N,S-CNTs could largely enhance the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activities by facilitating the mass transportation and exposing more active sites. The abundant defects produced by the evaporation of Cd and S doping could provide more active sites for ORR and OER. Coupling with Co9S8, Co9S8/N,S-CNTs possesses more defects in the carbon skeleton, better electron conductivity, and larger effective electrochemical area. Co9S8/N,S-CNTs not only performs excellent ORR activity with a half-wave potential of 0.821 V but also owns RuO2-like OER activity in alkaline solution. The potential difference (Delta E) between ORR and OER is as low as 0.78 V in 0.10 M KOH. The excellent bi-functional performance enables the potential to be utilized in fuel cells and metal-air batteries.									12	2	0	0	0	0	12			0957-4484	1361-6528		WOS:000453845600001	30523950

Herein, a DASC consisting of nickel-iron hetero-diatomic pairs anchored on nitrogen-doped graphene is synthesized. It exhibits extraordinary electrocatalytic activities and stability for both CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Furthermore, the rechargeable Zn-CO2 battery equipped with such bifunctional catalyst shows high Faradaic efficiency and outstanding rechargeability. The in-depth experimental and theoretical analyses reveal the orbital coupling between the catalytic iron center and the adjacent nickel atom, which leads to alteration in orbital energy level, unique electronic states, higher oxidation state of iron, and weakened binding strength to the reaction intermediates, thus boosted CO2RR and OER performance. This work provides critical insights to rational design, working mechanism, and application of hetero-DASCs. Diatomic site catalysts utilize two adjacent atomic metal species for their complementary functionalities and synergistic actions. Here, the authors report the orbital coupling of hetero-diatomic nickel-iron site boosts CO2 reduction reaction and oxygen evolution reaction.									69	4	0	0	1	0	68			2041-1723			WOS:000672164300001	34215728	
B	Yi Zhan								Non-noble metal oxygen electrocatalysts for zinc-air batteries								Non-noble metal oxygen electrocatalysts for zinc-air batteries								152 pp	152 pp						2015	2015	Rechargeable Zn-air batteries have drawn strong recent interest because theoretically they can combine rechargeability with the high specific energy (energy stored per unit mass) of fuel cell systems. Part of the high specific energy is due to the cathode active material (i.e. oxygen) being drawn from the surrounding air and not stored in any form in the cell like traditional rechargeable batteries (the other reason is the use of a highly condensed "fuel" in the form of an oxidizable zinc metal as the anode). However, the reactions in the air electrode are kinetically challenged, resulting in a significant lowering of the round-trip efficiency. Effective catalysts are needed to reduce the high overpotentials in these reactions, i.e. oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) during discharge process and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) during recharge process. While catalysts based on the platinum group metals (PGM) have a long developmental history and some success with fuel cells and water electrolyzers, their prohibitively high cost is disincentive to any large-scale deployment (which is however the target market for rechargeable Zn-air batteries). The need for non-PGM catalyst alternatives is therefore clear and present. The thesis presents several designs of non-PGM electrocatalysts which have shown high activity for the oxygen reactions in alkaline solution.

It is found that the 1 C charge acceptance ability of the spherical Ni(OH)(2) electrode with heavy rare earth oxide additive is improved; however, the heavy rare earth oxide as additive has negative effect on the high rate discharge performance at room temperature. The cyclic voltammetry (CV) results indicate that the heavy rare earth oxide as additive can increase the overpotential of oxygen evolution at high temperatures. The oxygen evolution reaction is effectively depressed and leads to the increase of charge efficiency of Ni(OH)(2) electrode at high temperatures. Moreover, the reversibility of Ni(OH)(2) electrode is also improved at high temperatures.									2	2	0	0	0	0	3			1002-185X			WOS:000275509900015

Whereas, most of the measured bulk BSCF samples suffer the unsatisfactory OER activities which are much more inferior than that of the state-of-the-art catalyst of IrO2. In this work, we synthesize the A-site deficient BSCF nanofibers with the diameter of 300 nm by electrospinning for the first time. Thanks to the one dimensional (1D) nanofiber structure and A-site deficiency, the optimized BSCF nanofibers (BSCF-80-ES) demonstrate the remarkably enhanced OER activity with a low potential of 1.54 V at 10 mA cm(-2) in 1 M KOH and an improved oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activity. It is noteworthy that the OER potential of BSCF-80-ES keeps almost unchanged during the longterm test, indicating an excellent OER stability. Moreover, BSCF-80-ES with the high bifunctional catalytic activity and superb stability can be used as a promising oxygen catalyst for aqueous and flexible solid-state zinc-air batteries.									19	0	0	0	2	0	19			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000580627000061

Moreover, in-depth mechanistic investigations demonstrate the active phases are the metallic Co4N core inside with a thin cobalt oxides/hydroxides shell during the OER process.

Here, we report a composite material consisting of CuCo2O4 nanoparticles anchored on nitrogenated reduced graphene oxide (CuCo2O4/NrGO) as a highly efficient oxygen evolution electrocatalyst in both alkaline and neutral solutions for the first time. In 1 M KOH, 0.1 M KOH and 0.1 M PBS, CuCo2O4/NrGO catalyst exhibited a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at a small overpotential of 0.36 V, 0.41 V and 1.15 V respectively, which are better than those of RuO2 and IrO2 catalysts. The CuCo2O4/NrGO exhibited good stability under strong alkaline conditions. The enhanced OER performance of CuCo2O4/NrGO is attributed to the presence of Cu2+ ions at the octahedral sites, reduction in the size of the CuCo2O4 nanoparticles as measured by the TEM, enhancement of electrochemically active surface area (ECSA), and synergetic effect between CuCo2O4 nanoparticles and NrGO sheets. This cost effective and highly efficient catalyst can possibly replace the expensive catalysts such as RuO2 and IrO2. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Nevertheless, the inherent high reaction energy barrier and four-electron mechanism of anodic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) result in higher reaction overpotential, slower reaction rate, and more power consumption, affording low hydrogen evolution efficiency in the cathodic half reaction. This considerably limits practical applications. Manganese-based oxides (MnOx) show great promise for driving OER due to their worthwhile intrinsic properties, such as well-controlled morphology, structure, and electronic state. Moreover, a large number of unsaturated edge sites on the surface of MnOx can not only improve the active area to increase the number of active sites, but they also help adsorb OH- in alkaline solutions, thereby facilitating oxygen production. From this perspective, we review the emerging applications of a series of MnOx materials as highly efficient electrocatalysts for OER. By highlighting the reaction mechanisms, superiorities, and challenges of each type of MnOx, we hope to provide guidance for constructing more efficient MnOx electrocatalysts and reveal the bright future for future applications in the highly exciting energy-conversion-related areas.									14	1	0	0	0	0	15			2050-7488			INSPEC:21031531

Transitional metal phosphides are considered as one of the most promising bifunctional water splitting electrocatalysts. Herein, we reported a facile two-step method (firstly hydrothermal preparation, then phosphorization under low temperature) to synthesize the bead-chain like nanoarrays of CoP supported on three dimensional Nickel foam (CoP/NF). The as-prepared CoP/NF could act as an efficient bifunctional catalyst for overall water splitting. The catalyst exhibited remarkable activity for both the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in alkaline media, delivering a current density of 10 mA/cm(2) at an overpotential of 281 mV for OER and 95 mV for HER, respectively. Efficient water splitting in alkaline system was realized by applying a two-electrode system with the CoP/NF acting as both the anode and cathode. The applied potential was 1. 63 V to obtain the current density of 10 mA/cm(2), and good stability was also testified.									8	5	0	0	0	0	9			0253-3820	1872-2040		WOS:000455897800004

Enhanced Bifunctional Catalytic Activity of Cobalt Phosphide Flowers Anchored N-Doped Reduced Graphene Oxide for Hydrogen and Oxygen Evolution								CHEMELECTROCHEM				7	15			3319	3323		10.1002/celc.202000680				AUG 3 2020	2020	In this work, we demonstrate morphology-controlled synthesis of flower-like cobalt phosphide decorated on nitrogen doped reduced graphene oxide (NrGO), which act as bifunctional electrocatalysts toward both hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The as-synthesized CoP-NrGO, formedviahydrothermal reaction followed by gas-solid reaction, attains an OER current density of 10 mA cm(-2)at an overpotential of 0.38 V, which is on par with that of its Co(OH)(2)-NrGO counterpart and the benchmarked IrO(2)catalyst. On the other hand, the conversion of Co(OH)(2)to CoP is seen to improve its HER performance drastically. CoP-NrGO reached a current density of 10 mA cm(-2)at an overpotential of 0.184 V which is 0.204 V anodic to Co(OH)(2)-NrGO. The improved performance could be attributed to reduced charge transfer resistance following the phosphidation process. From the comparison of the electrocatalytic performance of the catalysts, it can be inferred that phosphidation has a considerable effect only on the cathodic HER.									10	0	0	0	0	0	10			2196-0216			WOS:000563957400015

The activated biochar generated at 900 degrees C (Biochar-act900) exhibited improved oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) performances in alkaline media, in terms of the onset potential and generated current density. Rotating disk electron result shows that the average of 2.65 electrons per oxygen molecule was transferred during ORR of Biochar-act900. The highest power density of 528.2 mW/m(2) and the maximum stable voltage of 0.47V were obtained by employing Biochar-act900 as cathode catalyst, which is comparable to the Pt/C cathode. Owning to these advantages, it is expected that the banana-derived biochar cathode can find application in microbial fuel cell systems.									23	1	0	0	7	0	23			1537-744X			WOS:000343455900001

Herein, state-of-the-art hypotheses are combined on electrocatalytic active metal sites toward the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) to develop a highly efficient catalyst based on Earth-abundant cobalt and zinc oxides. The precursor catalyst Zn0.35Co0.65O is synthesized via a fast microwave-assisted approach at low temperatures. Subsequently, it transforms in situ from the wurtzite structure to the layered gamma-Co(O)OH, while most of its zinc leaches out. This material shows outstanding catalytic performance and stability toward the OER in 1 m KOH (overpotential at 10 mA cm(-2) eta(initial) = 306 mV, eta(98 h) = 318 mV). By comparing the electrochemical results and ex situ analyses to today's literature, clear structure-activity correlations are able to be identified. The findings suggest that coordinately unsaturated cobalt octahedra on the surface are indeed the active centers for the OER.									25	0	0	0	0	0	25			1614-6832	1614-6840		WOS:000468796000016

The mesopore evolution during thermal treatment was examined systematically giving insights into the formation process of mesoporous NiFe2O4. Detailed nitrogen physisorption analysis including desorption scanning experiments reveal the presence of highly accessible mesopores generating surface areas of up to 200 m(2)/g. The ability of the NiFe2O4 powders to perform electrocatalytic oxygen evolution reaction under alkaline conditions was investigated, highlighting the advantages of mesopore insertion.

Owing to their environmental friendliness, transition-metal oxides have been widely applied as electrode materials for energy systems. However, the application of these metal oxides, in one way or another, tends to suffer from several disadvantages, which urge many researchers to concentrate on improving the performance of the metal oxides so as to meet the demand of different applications. Herein, oxygen vacancies were introduced into 3D Co3O4 nanowires and utilized as suitable electrodes for water oxidation and lithium-ion batteries.									33	1	0	0	1	0	33			2196-0216			WOS:000412892600004

The main features, such as adsorption and underpotential deposition of hydrogen (both protium and deuterium), as well as the specific charge capacity for monolayer oxide growth with successive increase in oxygen content (preceding hydrogen and oxygen evolution, respectively, with characteristic desorption peaks), were more or less marked in both electrolytes. Some distinctly different behaviour, however, has been observed, revealing that heavy and regular water behave almost as different solvent ambients. The hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) particularly in alkaline heavy water occurs at substantially more negative potentials, while oxygen evolution becomes shifted to considerably more positive potential values. Hydrogen absorption, besides adsorption, of both protium and deuterium, has been marked clearly by the continuously growing charge capacity of the diffusional desorption peak, whose extent depends on the evolving rate and contact time of hydrogen evolution and distinctly exceeds both one-to-one hydrogen to platinum (H/Pt or D/Pt) atom coverage on the exposed electrode surface, and relative to the corresponding reversible adsorption wave charge area for its underpotential deposition. In addition, the hydrogen oxidation peak immediately following its desorption (in particular from acidic heavy water) has also been clearly marked on voltammograms. A distinct merging and melding together of two initial deuterium reversible desorption peaks into the diffusional desorption peak in acidic heavy water has been discernibly scanned, too. Oxide formation usually starts at more anodic potentials together with deuterium oxidation and, specifically in acidic media, proceeds vigorously with higher and continuously growing rates and merging together with evolving molecular oxygen, while the prevailing oxygen evolution thereby becomes shifted to more positive potential values. These features reveal that, owing to its distinctly different steric factor, heavy water (in particular in acidic media) behaves as a stronger oxidizing agent than regular water. Some discernible properties of the interplay between hydrogen and oxygen on the Pt electrode in both electrolytes along the potential axis have been clearly marked and pointed out. The Rowland or EDTA effect on the potentiodynamic features of Pt has also been scanned and displayed.									25	1	0	0	1	0	25			0360-3199			WOS:A1993LW40800002

The objective of this work was to develop a new electrocatalytic material for long-lasting and economical high performance electrodes. New electrodes were prepared by electrodeposition of nickel, nickel-ruthenium and nickel-iridium alloys. They were then activated by anodic polarization at 100 mA cm-2 to form an oxide layer. The electrocatalytic activity was characterized for the OER in 5 m KOH solution. The results show that nickel-iridium alloys provide greater electrocatalytic activity for the OER and better corrosion resistance than nickel-ruthenium in alkaline solution. The effects of transition elements on improving the performance of the nickel electrode are then discussed.									15	4	0	0	0	0	21			0021-891X			WOS:A1991EP14600011

In this study, we used a three-dimensional nanostructure on nickel substrate to easily synthesize a nickel-cobalt phosphide electrocatalyst (NixCoyP, x = 1, 1.5, 2; y = 1, 1.5, 2) through hydrothermal reaction and in situ phosphorylation. The NiCo1.5 P exhibited relatively excellent oxygen evolution activity performance, and it only needed the overpotentials of 123 mV for HER in 1 M KOH to perform the current densities of 10 mA cm(-2). It is worth mentioning that the Ni2CoP exhibited better bifunctional electrocatalyst characteristics. As to water splitting, the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) require 197 and 253 mV overpotentials separately to provide a current density of 10 mA cm(-2). Its relatively excellent electrochemical performance can be ascribed to the high-density sea urchin-like three-dimensional structure, which provides greater specific surface area and more active site. Besides, Ni2CoP also shows long-term durability lasting 80,000 s, and on this basis, there is no distinct deactivation. This work emphasizes that Ni2P and CoP play a vital role relative to the good activity of HER. Moreover, the unique morphology with self-supported structure provides a larger specific surface area, making it possible the exposure of higher amount of active sites for HER. These self-supported electrocatalysts that do not require a binder could also make the electrode more active and stable. This work, therefore, presents a strategy that is controllable and feasible strategy for the synthesis of bimetallic phosphides with unique morphology and high HER and OER activity.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			0957-4522	1573-482X		WOS:000604257300014

This new manuscript proposes the synthesis of graphitic carbon nanofibers obtained by electrospinning with a cobalt-based spinel oxide, Co3O4/CNF. By means of a simple, reproducible and scalable method, a bifunctional catalyst with a promising performance is obtained, being able of carrying out the electrocatalysis of oxygen (oxidation of water, evolution and reduction of oxygen) in a basic solution. The combination of the active species on cobalt oxide (Co2+, Co3+ and Co-N-x), along with active species in the carbon nanofiber (graphitic and pyridinic N), gives rise to a catalyst with a remarkable reversibility (difference between E-10 mA/cm2 (evolution) and Ehalf-wave-potential (reduction)): Delta E = 795 mV), a low over-potential for the evolution of oxygen (eta= 416 mV) and 919 mV of oxygen reduction onset potential, very similar to that of a benchmark catalyst, Pt/C.

In this work, a series of Sr-doped La-based perovskite oxide catalysts with compositions of La1-xSrxFeO3-delta (x = 0, 0.2, 0.5, 0.8, and 1) are synthesized and characterized. The OER-specific activities in alkaline solution increase in the order of LaFeO3-delta (LF), La0.8Sr0.2FeO3-delta (LSF-0.2), La0.5Sr0.5FeO3-delta (LSF-0.5), SrFeO3-delta (SF), and La0.2Sr0.8FeO3-delta (LSF-0.8). We establish a direct correlation between the enhancement in the specific activity and the amount of surface oxygen vacancies as well as the surface Fe oxidation states. The improved specific activity for LSF-0.8 is clearly linked to the optimum amount of surface oxygen vacancies and surface Fe oxidation states. We also find that the OER performance stability is a function of the crystal structure and the deviation in the surface La and/or Sr composition(s) from their bulk stoichiometric compositions. The cubic structure and lower deviation, as is the case for LSF-0.8, led to a higher OER performance stability. These surface performance relations provide a promising guideline for constructing efficient water oxidation.									110	3	0	0	2	0	111			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000430156000037	29546981

The influence of the electrolyte anions on the behavior of Li-O-2 cells was thought to be negligible. However, it has recently been suggested that specific anions can have a dramatic effect on the chemistry of a Li-O-2 cell. In the present paper, we describe how LiNO3 in polyether solvents can improve both oxygen reduction (ORR) and oxygen evolution (OER) reactions. In particular, the nitrate anion can enhance the ORR by enabling a mechanism that involves solubilized species like superoxide radicals, which allows for the formation of submicronic Li2O2 particles. Such phenomena were also observed in Li-O-2 cells with high donor number solvents, such as dimethyl sulfoxide dimethylformamide (DMF) and dimethylacetamide (DMA). Nevertheless, their instability toward oxygen reduction, lithium metals, and high oxidation potentials renders them less suitable than polyether solvents. In turn, using catalysts like LiI to reduce the OER overpotential might enhance parasitic reactions. We show herein that LiNO3 can serve as an electrolyte and useful redox mediator. NO2 ions are formed by the reduction of nitrate ions on the anode. Their oxidation forms NO2, which readily oxidizes to Li2O2. The latter process moves the OER overpotentials down into a potential window suitable for polyether solvent-based cells. Advanced analytical tools, including in situ electrochemical quartz microbalance (EQCM) and ESR plus XPS, HR-SEM, and impedance spectroscopy, were used for the studies reported herein.									104	2	0	0	5	0	104			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000359279800055	26158598

The B/N-codoped mesoporous nanocarbon supported Co(II)(1-x)Co(0)(x/3)Mn(III)(2x/3)S nanoparticles exhibit a superior OER performance compared to that of IrO2 catalyst and comparable Zn-air battery performance to that of the Pt-based battery. The rechargeable Zn-air battery shows high discharge peak power density (over 250 mW cm(-2)) and current density (180 mA cm(-2) at 1 V), specific capacity (similar to 550 mAh g(-1)), small charge-discharge voltage gap of similar to 0.72 V at 20 mA cm(-2) and even higher stability than the Pt-based battery. The advanced performance of the bifunctional catalysts highlights the beneficial role of the simultaneous formation of Mn(III) and Co(0) as well as the dispersed hybridization with the codoped nanocarbon support.									61	4	0	0	2	0	63			1944-8244			WOS:000377150400019	27163673

Compared to Ag/C and CoFe2O4/C, the Ag-CoFe2O4/C catalyst shows better activity for ORR in term of half-wave potential. The ORR on Ag-CoFe2O4/C mainly favours 4e(-) reaction pathway.

Here we present a rapid, room-temperature sulfuration strategy that transforms stainless steel meshes into highly active and stable oxygen evolution electrodes. Such method is easy to be scaled up to produce square meter-sized stainless steel electrodes (1 m Chi 1 m) with NiFeCr-containing trimetal sulfides on the surface. In a standard three-electrode cell, the sulfurated stainless steel electrode exhibits 7.2 times higher OER activity than the corresponding stainless steel, and possesses remarkable catalytic stability for over 1000 h at the current density range of 100-200 mA cm(-2). During the OER, the Cr and S species are demonstrated to be easily detached from the electrode surface, and the in situ formed gamma-(Fe,Ni)OOH is found to be the electrocatalytic active phase. Furthermore, we integrate the sulfurated stainless steel electrode into an industrial alkaline electrolyzer as the anode (400 cm(2)). Our results demonstrate that the electrolyzer based on the sulfurated stainless steel electrode exhibits a better catalytic activity than the electrolyzer based on the Raney nickel electrode, a widely-adopted electrode in commercial water-alkali electrolyzers, and delivers a catalytic current of c.a. 300 mA cm(-2) for over 120 h under the industrial catalytic conditions (30% KOH, 80 degrees C).									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000815964800004

Although silicon is a promising photoelectrode substrate, photocorrosion prevents its use in such devices, especially when employed as photoanodes for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Here, it is shown that Fe nanoparticles (NPs), deposited by cathodic electrodeposition onto n-Si, can promote hole transfer for the OER. The influence of the surface coverage, the Si structure, as well as the electrolyte are studied here in detail. It is reported that the NP density and the Si structuration drastically affect the photoelectrochemical performance and that the electrolyte influences the stability, allowing operation times as long as 130 h for these inhomogeneously coated photoelectrodes.									14	1	0	0	0	0	13			1614-6832	1614-6840		WOS:000501460100001

Herein, Ru-anchored CoP embedded in N-doped porous carbon nanocubes (Ru-CoP/NCs) is successfully prepared. The Ru-CoP/NC reveals superior hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) properties and stability under alkaline conditions, and the corresponding overpotentials are 22 and 330 mV at 10 mA.cm(-2), respectively. The unique N-doped porous carbon nanocube could boost the conductivity, and the electronic structure of CoP can be adjusted by the anchoring of Ru. Therefore, the strong interaction between Ru atoms and CoP improves the hydrogen adsorption on the catalyst, hence boosting the HER/OER performance of the Ru-CoP/NC catalyst. This work provides a facile method to exploit high-performance catalysts for water splitting.									9	0	0	0	1	0	9			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000751894800023	34791871

CHF3-plasma can selectively fill oxygen vacancies with F- ions that can drastically tune the electronic structure with the highest electronegativity and create metal vacancies at the same time. The as-obtained F-Co3Fe LDH ultrathin nanosheets exhibit excellent oxygen evolution reaction (OER) properties. The outstanding electrochemical activity can be attributed to the incorporation of F- ions that strongly modulate the charge distribution of surrounding atoms to facilitate the adsorption of OER intermediates. This work provides a simple way to create metal vacancies and selectively fill oxygen vacancies with fluorine at the same time, and brings about a deep understanding of the electronic environment-activity relationship of LDHs for the OER.									51	5	0	0	6	0	51			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000474712700011

However, the reported strategies for synthesizing SACs generally have special requirements for either the anchored metals or the supports. Herein, we report a universal approach of electrochemical deposition that is applicable to a wide range of metals and supports for the fabrication of SACs. The depositions were conducted on both cathode and anode, where the different redox reactions endowed the SACs with distinct electronic states. The SACs from cathodic deposition exhibited high activities towards hydrogen evolution reaction, while those from anodic deposition were highly active towards oxygen evolution reaction. When cathodically- and anodically-deposited Ir single atoms on Co0.8Fe0.2Se2@Ni foam were integrated into a two-electrode cell for overall water splitting, a voltage of 1.39V was required at 10mAcm(-2) in alkaline electrolyte. While single-atom catalysts exhibit intriguing catalytic performances and electronic structures, syntheses are often tailored to a particular system. Here, authors report electrochemical deposition as a universal approach for the fabrication of single-atom catalysts over range of metals and supports.									152	8	0	0	16	0	155			2041-1723			WOS:000543997700021	32139683

Both RM-FIT and RM-TIT exhibited excellent bifunctional electrocatalytic activities in alkaline media. The air electrodes using RM-FIT and RM-TIT showed enhanced overpotential characteristics and stable cyclability over 100 cycles in the Li-O-2 cells, demonstrating high potential as efficient OER and ORR catalysts.									164	8	0	0	11	0	165			1530-6984	1530-6992		WOS:000371946300082	26821307

While the functionality of single-metal catalysts is relatively well-understood, the mechanism and synergy of bimetallic systems are less explored. Herein, the design and fabrication of an integrated flexible electrode based on NiCo2S4/graphitic carbon nitride/carbon nanotube (NiCo2S4@g-C3N4-CNT) are reported. Comparative studies evidence the electronic transfer from bimetallic Ni/Co active sites to abundant pyridinic-N in underlying g-C3N4 and the synergistic effect with coupled conductive CNTs for promoting reversible oxygen electrocatalysis. Theoretical calculations demonstrate the unique coactivation of bimetallic Ni/Co atoms by pyridinic-N species (a Ni, Co-N-2 moiety), which simultaneously downshifts their d-band center positions and benefits the adsorption/desorption features of oxygen intermediates, accelerating the reaction kinetics. The optimized NiCo2S4@g-C3N4 -CNT hybrid manifests outstanding bifunctional performance for catalyzing oxygen reduction/ evolution reactions, highly efficient for realistic zinc-air batteries featuring low overpotential, high efficiency, and long durability, superior to those of physical mixed counterparts and state-of-the-art noble metal catalysts. The identified bimetallic coactivation mechanism will shed light on the rational design and interfacial engineering of hybrid nanomaterials for diverse applications.									247	18	0	0	11	0	250			0935-9648	1521-4095		WOS:000469242400014	30873660

Herein, a nanostructured spinel Mn1.3Co1.3Cu0.4O4 (MCCO)-based bifunctional oxygen electrode is developed for the ORR and OER using an infiltration process. A uniform distribution and percolated network of MCCO on a Sc-stabilized ZrO2 (ScSZ) backbone without agglomeration is achieved by controlling the polymeric agent and catalyst loading. SOCs with the nanostructured MCCO-ScSZ electrode exhibited superior electrochemical performance of similar to 2.2 W/cm(2) in the fuel cell mode and similar to 1.4 A/cm(2) at 1.3 V in the electrolysis mode at 750 degrees C. To date, these results show the best performance for SOCs using spinel-based oxygen electrodes. Thus, our findings demonstrate that the nanoengineered MCCO catalyst has enormous potential as a bifunctional oxygen electrode for high-performance reversible SOCs at reduced temperatures.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0378-7753	1873-2755		WOS:000809626300003

Here, using the first-principles methods based on density functional theory (DFT), the Co and N codoped graphene systems (CoNx-gra, x = 1-4) with high ORR activity were further suggested as efficient OER catalysts. It was found that the activity on Co site of CoNx-gra towards ORR and OER would be affected by both the N-dopant concentration and configuration. The extrapolated overpotential of 0.37 V for either ORR or OER on CoNx-gra systems is comparable to those of noble metal benchmark catalysts. The origin of the activity stems from moderate hybridization between Co 3d orbital and p-orbital from O species, governed by the neighboring N coordination environment. Our results highlight the potential application of transition metal and non-metal codoped graphene as efficient non-precious bifunctional catalysts. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

In this communication, we report a facile strategy to realize energy-saving hydrogen generation by replacing OER with a thermodynamically more favorable aloe extract (AE) oxidation reaction (AOR). An Fe-doped CoP nanosheet array (Fe-CoP/CC) is used as a bifunctional catalyst for both AOR and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). The Fe-CoP/CCJFe-CoP/ CC couple requires a cell voltage of 1.51 V to drive 20 mA cm(-2) in 1.0 M KOH containing AE; however, a cell volatge of 1.63 V is required to drive the same current density in the absence of AE. Fe-CoP/CC also exhibits strong long-termelectrochemical durability and nearly 100% faradaic efficiency.									120	9	0	0	1	0	121			1359-7345	1364-548X		WOS:000401934800006	28487917

Particularly the degradation of electrode-electrolyte interface contact at an oxygen electrode has a great impact on SOCs overall performance. However, because the oxygen evolution or reduction reaction (OER/ORR) is predominantly responsible for cell activation losses. It is important to minimize these losses at the oxygen electrode. A thorough understanding of the electrochemical reactions and structural characteristics of the oxygen electrode -electrolyte interface is needed. Therefore, symmetrical LSM-YSZ-LSM cells were prepared to examine degradation mechanisms and kinetics of OER and ORR under different operating conditions. Each cell was examined by electrochemical methods and spectroscopic methods. Higher operating temperature leads to better performance; in contrast, the measured variation of oxygen concentration has a negligible effect on the cell performance.					7th International Conference on Chemical Technology (ICCT)7th International Conference on Chemical Technology (ICCT)	APR 15-17, 2019APR 15-17, 2019	Ceska Spolecnost Prumyslove Chemie; SCHP CR; ASCR, Int Chem Proc Fundamentals; Univ Pardubice, Fakulta Chemicko Technologicka; STU, FCHPT; UniCRE; Vysoka Skola Chemicko Technologicka Praze; Parr; BioTech; Dekonta; Nicolet CZ; OPTIK Instruments; Bochemie; ZVU Engn a s; Unipetrol; EuroSupport; D Ex Instruments; Metrohm; EKOMOR; Draslovka; ExplosiaCeska Spolecnost Prumyslove Chemie; SCHP CR; ASCR, Int Chem Proc Fundamentals; Univ Pardubice, Fakulta Chemicko Technologicka; STU, FCHPT; UniCRE; Vysoka Skola Chemicko Technologicka Praze; Parr; BioTech; Dekonta; Nicolet CZ; OPTIK Instruments; Bochemie; ZVU Engn a s; Unipetrol; EuroSupport; D Ex Instruments; Metrohm; EKOMOR; Draslovka; Explosia	Mikulov, CZECH REPUBLICMikulov, CZECH REPUBLIC	0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2336-811X	2336-8128	978-80-88307-00-6	WOS:000515696600018

The reaction rate changes abruptly when the oxygen is completely consumed. A mechanism that explains this phenomenon and models the low temperature oxidation of formaldehyde is presented. In the presence of oxygen, the formaldehyde is consumed according to a degenerate branched chain reaction involving HO2 radicals and H2O2; once the oxygen is consumed, the reaction proceeds via a mechanism of linear chains initiated by the decomposition of H2O2. From the proposed mechanism, simulated curves (product evolution, pressure change and temperature) have been obtained in good agreement with experimental curves, for different temperatures and equivalence ratios.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0037-8968			WOS:A1995TH54900007

A 3D mesoporous vdW heterostructure of graphene and nitrogen-doped MoS2 via a two-step sequential chemical vapor deposition method is constructed. Such strategy is demonstrated to offer an all-round engineering of 2D materials including the morphology, edge, defect, interface, and electronic structure, thereby leading to robustly modified properties and greatly enhanced electrochemical activities. The hydrogen evolution is substantially accelerated on MoS2, while the oxygen reduction and evolution are significantly improved on graphene.

Two dimensional (2D) layered double hydroxides (LDHs) are commonly regarded as promising electrocatalysts for oxygen evolution reaction (OER), while they are not so efficient for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Herein, we propose the NiCo LDHs derived NiCoPx with 2D mesoporous ultrathin nanoplates structure in-situ grown on carbon paper (NiCoPx/CP). The special nanostructure and rich active sites endow the binder-free NiCoPx/CP with excellent bifunctional electrocatalytic performance toward HER and OER with very low overpotentials of 56 mV for HER at 10 mA cm(-2) and 239 mV for OER at 30 mA cm(-2). Moreover, the NiCoPx/CP can be directly used as electrodes for both anode and cathode to construct an efficient alkaline water electrolyzer with a cell votage of 1.58 Vat 10 mA cm(-2), which show even better performance than that of the best known commercial Pt-C&RuO2/CP catalysts.

This laser processing method enabled the rapid synthesis of diverse heterogeneous alloy and oxide catalysts directly from cost-effective solution precursors, including catalysts with a high density of nanocrystalline metal alloy inclusions within an amorphous oxide matrix. The nanoscale heterogeneous structures of the synthesized catalysts were consistent with reactive force-field Monte Carlo calculations. By evaluating the impact of varying transition metal oxide composition ratios, we created a stable Fe0.63Co0.19Ni0.18Ox/C catalyst with a Tafel slope of 38.23 mV dec(-1) and overpotential of 247 mV, a performance similar to that of IrO2 . Synthesized Fe0.63Co0.19Ni0.18Ox/C and Fe0.14Co0.46Ni0.40Ox/C catalysts were experimentally compared in terms of catalytic performance and structural characteristics to determine that higher iron content and a less crystalline structure in the secondary matrix decrease the charge transfer resistance and thus is beneficial for electrocatalytic activity. This conclusion is supported by density-functional theory calculations showing distorted active sites in ternary metal catalysts are key for lowering overpotentials for the oxygen evolution reaction.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			1936-0851	1936-086X		WOS:000665748900050	34061497

In an aprotic cell, for example, the discharge product, Li2O2, forms through a combination of solution and surface chemistries(9-11) that results in the formation of a baffling toroidal morphology(12-15). In a solid electrolyte, neither the reaction mechanism at the cathode nor the nature of the reaction product is known. Here we report the full-cycle reaction pathway for Li-O-2 batteries and show how this correlates with the morphology of the reaction products. Using aberration-corrected environmental transmission electron microscopy (TEM) under an oxygen environment, we image the product morphology evolution on a carbon nanotube (CNT) cathode of a working solid-state Li-O-2 nanobattery(16) and correlate these features with the electrochemical reaction at the electrode. We find that the oxygen-reduction reaction (ORR) on CNTs initially produces Li-O-2, which subsequently disproportionates into Li2O2 and O-2. The release of O-2 creates a hollow nanostructure with Li2O outer-shell and Li2O2 inner-shell surfaces. Our findings show that, in general, the way the released O-2 is accommodated is linked to lithium-ion diffusion and electron-transport paths across both spatial and temporal scales; in turn, this interplay governs the morphology of the discharging/charging products in Li-O-2 cells.									118	9	0	0	4	0	123			1748-3387	1748-3395		WOS:000402769100010	28346458

However, the reconstruction to generate in-situ catalytically FeNi-based oxides or hydroxides during OER process and high electrical conductivity demand foster the great pursuit of the rational design of FeNi-based OER electrocatalyst a big challenge. Herein, we design and fabricate a nanostructured metallic FeNi2S4 as a highly efficient OER electrocatalyst. This catalyst exhibits an overpotential of (250 mV) and a Tafel slope (62 mV dec(-1)), that outperforms the benchmark of commercial RuO2. The experimental results demonstrate that the alloying effect and the superior electrical conductivity, endow it a great electrocatalytic performance. Such a nanostructured metallic OER electrocatalyst shows a great promise in water splitting.									30	0	0	0	1	0	30			2211-2855	2211-3282		WOS:000639191300014

In this work, fullerene iron oxide composite, derived from mineral water waste bottles, was used as a catalyst for electrodes in an alkaline fuel cell instead of platinum. The results demonstrate that an oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) was established to proceed through the efficacious four-electron reduction path, and all the reaction steps were found to be spontaneous. Interestingly, fullerene iron oxide composite is a promising electrocatalyst with bi-functional activity for ORR and oxygen evolution reaction in addition to achieving good cycling stability compared to platinum in the alkaline electrolyte.									1	1	0	0	0	0	2			0361-5235	1543-186X		WOS:000511718200014

Here, a salt-template method to fabricate densely populated, monodispersed cobalt atoms on a nitrogen-doped graphene-like carbon support is reported, and achieving a dramatically higher site fraction of Co atoms (approximate to 15.3%) in the catalyst and demonstrating excellent electrocatalytic activity for both the oxygen reduction reaction and oxygen evolution reaction. The atomic dispersion and high site fraction of Co provide a large electrochemically active surface area of approximate to 105.6 m(2) g(-1), leading to very high mass activity for ORR (approximate to 12.164 A mg(Co)(-1) at 0.8 V vs reversible hydrogen electrode), almost 10.5 times higher than that of the state-of-the-art benchmark Pt/C catalyst (1.156 A mg(Pt)(-1) under similar conditions). It also demonstrates an outstanding mass activity for OER (0.278 A mg(Co)(-1)). The Zn-air battery based on this bifunctional catalyst exhibits high energy density of 945 Wh kg(Zn)(-1) as well as remarkable stability. In addition, both density functional theory based simulations and experimental measurements suggest that the Co-N-4 sites on the carbon matrix are the most active sites for the bifunctional oxygen electrocatalytic activity.									201	21	0	0	6	0	204			1614-6832	1614-6840		WOS:000471132800006

Water electrolysis is a dependable link of primary renewable energy and stable hydrogen energy. In this work, the fundamentals of water electrolysis, current popular electrocatalysts developed for cathodic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and anodic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in liquid electrolyte water electrolysis are reviewed. The main HER catalysts include noble metals, non-noble metals and composites, noble metal-free alloys, metal carbides, chalcogenides, phosphides and metal-free materials while the OER catalysts are focused on efficient Co-based, Ni-based materials and layered double hydroxide (LDH) materials. The strategies to improve catalytic activity, long-term durability and endurance to electrochemical erosion are introduced.

This is because efficient electrocatalysts can greatly reduce energy loss during the conversion process. However, poor catalytic performances and a shortage in catalyst material resources have greatly restricted the widespread applications of electrocatalysts in these energy conversion processes. To address this issue, earth-abundant two-dimensional (2D) materials with large specific surface areas and easily tunable electronic structures have emerged in recent years as promising high-performance electrocatalysts in various reactions, and because of this, this review will comprehensively discuss the engineering of these novel 2D material-based electrocatalysts and their associated heterostructures. In this review, the fundamental principles of electrocatalysis and important electrocatalytic reactions are introduced. Following this, the unique advantages of 2D material-based electrocatalysts are discussed and catalytic performance enhancement strategies are presented, including the tuning of electronic structures through various methods such as heteroatom doping, defect engineering, strain engineering, phase conversion and ion intercalation, as well as the construction of heterostructures based on 2D materials to capitalize on individual advantages. Finally, key challenges and opportunities for the future development of these electrocatalysts in practical energy conversion applications are presented.

Here we report that the highly conductive nanoporous architecture of an iridium oxide shell on a metallic iridium core, formed through the fast dealloying of osmium from an Ir25Os75 alloy, exhibits an exceptional balance between oxygen evolution activity and stability as quantified by the activity-stability factor. On the basis of this metric, the nanoporous Ir/IrO2 morphology of dealloyed Ir25Os75 shows a factor of similar to 30 improvement in activity-stability factor relative to conventional iridium-based oxide materials, and an similar to 8 times improvement over dealloyed Ir25Os75 nanoparticles due to optimized stability and conductivity, respectively. We propose that the activity-stability factor is a key "metric" for determining the technological relevance of oxide-based anodic water electrolyzer catalysts.									177	6	0	0	14	0	177			2041-1723			WOS:000414915900011	29129907

In this work, the nanostructure of Mn3O4/Graphene Quantum Dots (GQDs) was reported as a novel and high-performance ORR catalyst. The Mn3O4 nanoparticles were carted on GQDs via facile electrodeposition method. The performance of fabricated catalyst towards ORR is similar to Pt/C catalyst. The ORR onset potential for Mn3O4/GQDs-CP is - 0.1 V vs. (Hg/HgO), which is similar to that of the Pt/C-CP. The diffusion-limiting current density of the Mn3O4/GQDs-CP is approximately -3.1 mA cm(-2), which is higher than the Mn3O4/C-CP (-2.5 mA cm(-2)) and GQDs/CP (- 2.01 mA cm(-2)). Moreover, the higher stability was obtained for Mn3O4/GQDs-CP in comparison to Pt/C-CP. The excellent catalytic activity of the Mn3O4/GQDs-CP electrode stemmed from the synergistic effect between Mn3O4 and the GQDs nanoparticles.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0884-2914	2044-5326		WOS:000754935800002

Oxide films with different amounts of Li were prepared on glass, by chemical spray pyrolysis at 300degreesC, followed by a heat treatment at 400degreesC in air. The Li doping increases the electrical conductivity of these materials. In what concerns the roughness factor, an increase is also observed up to 3% of Li. From steady-state current-potential measurements, Tafel slopes close to 2.3RT/F were obtained in the low current range, irrespective to electrolyte concentration and Li percentage, pointing to the same oxygen evolution mechanism onto all prepared oxides. The reaction order with respect to OH- was found to be approximately 1.7. The electrodes performance towards the oxygen evolution increases with the increase in Li content. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

ROs harbor attractive features such as, striking activity in combination with remarkable regio- and stereo-selectivity, wide reaction spectrum, and broad substrate scope. In order to identify, characterize, and enhance targeted features of dioxygenases and related oxygen dependent enzymes via enzyme engineering and evolution approaches, proper screening and analytical methods are essential to detect and to analyze the expected dihydroxylation activity. This chapter presents different methodologies suitable for the study of dihydroxylation reactions. Detailed descriptions of our established analytical protocols for both gas and liquid chromatography, as well as a colorimetric assay to detect dioxygenase activity are provided. In addition, a novel and reliable system for real-time detection of oxygen consumption, in vivo, is reported.									5	1	0	0	4	0	6			0076-6879		978-0-12-824431-9	WOS:000612553000004	32943151

Therefore, it is crucial to steer the electrochemical oxygen evolution towards the adsorbate evolution mechanism (AEM) for improved durability of the RuO2 phase in acidic electrolytes. Herein, we developed a method to mix Pt atoms with the RuO2 matrix in a controlled manner by exploiting the oxophilicity of certain first-row transition metals in pulling out the Pt atoms in Pt-based nanorod@Ru under oxidative conditions. The resulting nanorod-shaped PtCo-RuO2/C showed 212.6 +/- 5.3 mV overpotential at 10 mA cm(-2) in a half-cell test and exhibited mass activity and long-term stability that greatly surpass those of Pt-RuO2/C and commercial Ir/C. Microscopic and spectroscopic analyses and density functional theory calculation of the nanocatalysts before and after OER cycles were conducted to scrutinize the role of Pt dopants for the observed durability and activity, revealing that Pt dopants promote *OOH adsorption and deprotonation, thereby limiting Ru overoxidation during OER cycles. When PtCo-RuO2/C was applied to a proton-exchange membrane water electrolyzer, it showed a single-cell performance of 3.7 A mg(Ru+Pt)(-1) at 2.0 V, which greatly outperforms that of commercial IrO2.									10	1	0	0	0	0	10			1754-5692	1754-5706		WOS:000723280100001

We prepared heterostructures of nickel selenide (NiSe) and cobalt-iron layer double hydroxide (CoFe-LDH), CoFe-LDH@NiSe, using hydrothermal and electrodeposition processes. The interfacial coupling enhanced the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). The CoFe-LDH@NiSe required an overpotential of 127 mV and 38 mV for a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) with a Tafel slope of 37 mV dec(-1) and 33 mV dec(-1) for OER and HER in alkaline solutions. Density functional theory calculations showed the enhancement of OER performance. The catalytic activity of CoFe-LDH@NiSe increased the electronic conductivity, enhancing the water splitting with 10 mA cm(-2) at 1.51 V. The robustness was demonstrated by the long-term stability for 120 h. This study provides a strategy for developing heteronanostructure electrocatalysts for water splitting in fields such as metal-air batteries and energy storage.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000787901000001

This review presents recent progress in the representative synthetic approaches and characterization techniques for SACs and their promising catalytic performance in electrochemical catalytic reactions including the oxygen reduction/evolution reaction (ORR/OER), hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), and carbon dioxide/nitrogen reduction reaction (CO2RR/NRR). The significance of the fabrication of nanostructures and single atom catalysts with high atom utilization will be presented in the Introduction section. Moreover, we investigate the relationship between the electrocatalytic properties and coordination structure of SACs based on experimental data and theoretical computations, which would provide rational guidance for efficient SAC design.

However, the catalysis of bulk amorphous alloy only originates from a few atomic layers of the surface, and the catalytic activity usually rapidly decreases due to the coverage of corrosion products during the OER process. Here, we report a Fe78Si9B13 nanoglass covered by in situ formed FeOOH (FeOOH@NG) that can perfectly combine self-activation and synergistic catalysis between volume and surface, leading to high activity, fast reaction kinetics, and stability of activity for OER. The Fe78Si9B13 nanoglass with abundant ordered boundaries introduced in the amorphous matrix is prepared via melt-spinning followed by high-pressure torsion (HPT). Afterwards, a FeOOH layer is introduced on the surface of the nanoglass by a cathodic corrosion activation method. The FeOOH layer not only exposes more active sites, but also generates hydroxyl radicals (OH) in oxygen vacancies to activate the Fe-based nanoglass matrix. The FeOOH@NG generates an overpotential of only 240 mV at 10 mA cm(-1) in 1 M KOH, and the Tafel slope is as low as 42 mV dec(-1).									7	0	0	0	0	0	7			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000649366800001

During gas evolution reactions, gas bubbles are vigorously and constantly forming and influencing these processes. In the past few decades, extensive studies have been performed to understand the evolution of gas bubbles, elucidate the mechanisms of how gas bubbles impact gas evolution reactions, and exploit new bubble-based strategies to improve the efficiency of gas evolution reactions. In this feature article, we summarize the classical theories as well as recent advancements in this field and provide an outlook on future research topics.									90	2	0	0	9	0	91			0743-7463			WOS:000466053000002	30888828

The oxygen reduction performance was in the order of Co3W3N >= MnWN2 >= Ni2W3N >= FeWN2 >= CrWN2. While the oxygen evolution was in that of Co3W3N >= CrWN2 >= Ni2W3N >= MnWN2 >= FeWN2. Then, the Co3W3N gave high bi-functional oxygen electrocatalytic properties. Furthermore, Ni-doped (Co1-xNix)(3)W3N (x = 0-1.0) were prepared and it was found that the (Co0.6Ni0.4)(3)W3N gave the highest bi-functional electrocatalytic properties. The cathode performance was achieved with the electrode containing 32 wt% (Co0.6Ni0.4)(3)W3N, i.e., the current density as high as 280 mA cm(-2), which was 10 times higher than that of a carbon-only electrode, was obtained at (0.80 V vs. RHE) in 5 mol L-1 KOH at 70 degrees C. Also, the (Co0.6Ni0.4)(3)W3N electrode showed high activity to oxygen evolution as high as 300 mA cm(-2) at (1.60 V vs. RHE). As it was observed the changes in binding energy at O-1s, N-1s, W-4f, Co(2)p, and Ni-2p spectra among Co3W3N, (Co0.6Ni0.4)(3)W3N, and Ni2W3N by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, the change in electrical properties at the surface of the nitrides should be one of the reasons of the high performance.

Amorphous nanocomposites have recently attracted interest owing to their superior electrocatalytic activity derived from their unique structure. Herein, amorphous CoFe double hydroxides (Am-CFDH) decorated with N-doped carbon nanotubes (NCNTs) is synthesized by a facile and simple one-pot approach under room temperature. Through electrochemical measurement, the bare Am-CFDH nanocomposite already exhibits a comparable oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity to the commercial IrO2 catalyst on account of its amorphous nature and the interaction between Co and Fe. The introduced NCNTs can provide better electrical conductivity, more anchoring sites, and functional groups for enhancing the transfer of electrons and reactants, preventing the agglomeration of Am-CFDH to expose more active sites, and improving the synergistic effect between Am-CFDH and NCNTs. Thus, the Am-CFDH/NCNTs hybrid displays favorable durability beyond 20 h and advanced OER activity, owning a small overpotential of 270 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) and a low Tafel slope of 56.88 mV dec(-1) in alkaline medium.									20	2	0	0	3	0	20			1864-5631	1864-564X		WOS:000478761200024	30946532

Various strategies have been attempted to accelerate the OER rate, but there are few studies on regulating the transport of reactants especially under large current densities when the mass transfer factor dominates the evolution reactions. Herein, NixFe1-x alloy nanocones arrays (with approximate to 2 nm surface NiO/NiFe(OH)(2) layer) are adopted to boost the transport of reactants. Finite element analysis suggests that the high-curvature tips can enhance the local electric field, which induces an order of magnitude higher concentration of hydroxide ions (OH-) at the active sites and promotes intrinsic OER activity by 67% at 1.5 V. Experimental results show that a fabricated NiFe nanocone array electrode, with optimized alloy composition, has a small overpotential of 190 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) and 255 mV at 500 mA cm(-2). When calibrated by electrochemical surface area, the nanocones electrode outperforms the state-of-the-art OER electrocatalysts. The positive effect of the tip-enhanced local electric field in promoting mass transfer is also confirmed by comparing samples with different tip curvature radii. It is suggested that this local field enhanced OER kinetics is a generic effect to other OER catalysts.									72	0	0	0	4	0	72			0935-9648	1521-4095		WOS:000612639600001	33511663

The electrochemical-step asymmetry index								METHODSX				8						101590	10.1016/j.mex.2021.101590		NOV 2021		2021	2021	The development of oxygen-evolution reaction (OER) electrocatalysts has been spurred by thermodynamic considerations on the free-energy landscape. Most commonly, electrocatalytic activity is approximated by the analysis of the free-energy changes among the mechanistic description, thereby taking only reaction steps with weak-binding adsorbates into account. Herein, a new method, denoted as the electrochemical-step asymmetry index (ESAI), is presented, which approximates electrocatalytic activity by penalizing both too strong as well as too weak bonding of intermediate states in order to mimic the well-known Sabatier principle.The electrochemical-step asymmetry index (ESAI) is a descriptor to approximate electrocatalytic activity based on the analysis of the free-energy changes for a given mechanistic description, exemplified by the oxygen evolution reaction (OER).The concept of the ESAI is based on the assumption that the optimum free-energy landscape has an asymmetric shape because this may factor overpotential and kinetic effects in the analysis, and the ESAI penalizes both too strong as well as too weak bonding of intermediate states to render a thorough representation of the Sabatier principle feasible.The ESAI is a conceptual development of the earlier proposed electrochemical-step symmetry index (ESSI), which relies on a symmetric distribution of the free-energy changes as thermodynamic optimum and which takes only weak-binding adsorbates into account.

Herein, we report an ammonia-modulated method for the synthesis of nanosized bimetallic ZnCo-ZIF, and owing to quantum effects, the nanosized ZnCo-ZIF can be transformed into novel 2D nanosheet arrays, which can be used as a bifunctional electrocatalyst. The size of the ZnCo-ZIF crystals can be controlled to less than 10nm by increasing the ammonia amount. The products from the nanosized particles through calcination have a distinct structure from the microsized nanoparticles owing to quantum effects and appear to be well-aligned 2D mono-crystalline Co3O4-embedded nitrogen-doped porous carbon nanosheet arrays (2D-MCo3O4-NCNAs). These novel 2D nanosheet arrays lead to large active surface areas, enhanced mass/charge transport capability, numerous active sites, and strong structure stability. When used as bifunctional catalysts for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER), the 2D-MCo3O4-NCNAs exhibit superior ORR activity as well as efficient OER activity in alkaline electrolyte, in comparison to the state-of-the-art precious metal catalysts.									16	2	0	0	0	0	17			0947-6539	1521-3765		WOS:000445447400032	30015386

Oxygen is the primary terminating group of MXenes; however, all of the reported Pt SACs till now are fabricated with F-terminated MXenes. According to the first-principles calculations of this work, the failure of using O-terminated MXenes as substrates is due to the low charge density around Pt and C, which weakens the catalytic activity of Pt. By adjusting the electronic structure of M2C using a second submetal with a lower work function than M, 18 potential bifunctional Pt SACs are constructed based on O-terminated bimetal MXenes. After further consideration of some important practical application factors such as overpotential, solvation effect, and reaction barriers, only four of them, i.e., Cr2Nb2C3O2-V-O-Pt, Cr2Ta2C3O2-V-O-Pt, Cr2NbC2O2-VO-Pt, and Cr2TaC2O2-V-O-Pt, are screened as bifunctional oxygen reduction reaction/oxygen evolution reaction (ORR/OER) catalysts. All of these screened SACs are originated from Cr-based MXenes, implying the significance of Cr-based MXenes in designing bifunctional Pt SACs.									13	0	0	0	0	0	13			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000718271300066	34699189

In this work, layered double hydroxide (LDH)-zinc oxide (ZnO) heterostructures and oxygen vacancies are constructed synchronously by plasma magnetron sputtering of NiFe-LDH. Using the optimal conditions, ZnO nanoparticles are uniformly distributed on the NiFe-LDH nano-flowers, which are prepared uniformly on the three-dimensional porous Ni foam. In the LDH-ZnO heterostructures and oxygen vacancies, electrons are depleted at the Ni cations on the NiFe-LDH surface and the active sites change from Fe cations to Ni cations during OER. Our theoretical assessment confirms the change of active sites after the deposition of ZnO and reveals the charge-transfer mechanism. Owing to the significant improvement in the OER dynamics, overall water splitting can be achieved at only 1.603 V in 1 M KOH when the Ni/LDH-ZnO and Ni/LDH are used as the anode and cathode, respectively. The work reveals a novel design of self-supported catalytic electrodes for efficient water splitting and also provides insights into the surface modification of catalytic materials.									38	0	0	0	3	0	38			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000575557800041	32862635

However, high-performance bifunctional catalysts toward both hydrogen evolution and oxygen oxidation reactions of neutral water have not been realized in spite of the technical importance for electrochemical hydrogen production in natural environments powered by renewable energy sources of wind, solar, and so on. Here, we report a nanoporous Co9S4P4 pentlandite with three-dimensional bicontinuous nanoporosity for electrochemical water splitting in neutral solutions. The three-dimensional binder-free catalyst shows a negligible onset overpotential, low Tafel slope, and excellent poisoning tolerance for hydrogen evolution reaction, comparable to or even better than commercial Pt catalysts. Remarkably, the new catalyst also has excellent catalytic activities toward oxygen evolution and, hence, can be used as both anode and cathode for overall neutral water splitting. These extraordinary catalytic activities toward neutral water splitting have never been obtained from non-noble-metal catalysts before. The bifunctional and low-cost catalyst holds great promise for practical applications in electrochemical water splitting in natural environments.									49	1	0	0	2	0	49			1944-8244			WOS:000457816900023	30614681

Cyclic voltammetry and square-wave voltammetry tests were conducted to explore the anodic processes of LiF-NdF3 melt after a lengthy period of pre-electrolysis purification at 1000 degrees C (during which the oxygen content reduced from 413 to 150 mg/kg). The oxidation process of oxygen ions was found to have two stages: oxidation product adsorption and CO/CO2 gas evolution. The adsorption stage was controlled by diffusion, whereas the gas evolution was controlled by the electrochemical reaction. In comparison with oxygen content of 413 mg/kg, the decrease in the amplitude of the current at low oxygen content of 150 mg/kg was much gentler during the forward scanning process when the anode effect occurred. Fluorine-ion oxidation peaks that occurred at about 4.2 V vs. Li/Li+ could be clearly observed in the reverse scanning processes, in which fluorine ions were oxidized and perfluorocarbons were produced, which resulted in an anode effect.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1674-4799	1869-103X		WOS:000606171200001

The as-prepared catalysts were characterized by carrying out X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), UV-visible diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (UV-Vis DRS), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The morphology of Ag3PO4 was controlled by simply adjusting the hydrothermal reaction temperature and time, without adding any templates and organic additives. Kinetics studies and characterization results revealed that the transformation from P2O74- to a PO43- radical was a rate-determining step, and influenced the morphology of Ag3PO4. Different oxygen evolution rates were observed for samples subjected to different hydrothermal reaction times, and the highest initial rate of O-2 evolution achieved was 582.55 mu mol h(-1) g(-1). Furthermore, for the samples prepared using a hydrothermal reaction time of 96 h, as the hydrothermal reaction temperature was increased, the oxygen evolution rate of the resulting sample decreased first and then increased, and the highest initial rate of O-2 evolution was 856.06 mu mol h(-1) g(-1), about twice the 418.34 mu mol h(-1) g(-1) value for the sample prepared using the coprecipitation method. A possible mechanism has been proposed to explain how the hydrothermal reaction temperature and time influenced the Ag3PO4 morphology. Our method provides a guiding hydrothermal strategy for the synthesis of insoluble electrolytes with various morphologies from relatively soluble electrolytes without the need to use templates and organic additives.									10	0	0	0	0	0	10			2046-2069			WOS:000472775900016	35515254

In this paper, bimetallic/carbon nanosheets electrocatalysts were prepared by high temperature carbonization using Hofmann-type metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) as precursors. It is worth noting that in this study, the morphology and structure of the catalyst was successfully adjusted by surfactant, and the Co/Fe-Dpyz@CNC (1000) catalyst obtained has a large specific surface area (316.3 m(2)/g) and rich exposed active centers. In addition, the coupling effect of Co and Fe bimetal optimizes the electronic structure of the graphite layer and enhances the conductivity of the catalyst. Co/Fe-Dpyz@CNC (1000) shows excellent OER performance, the overpotential is 318 mV@10 mA cm(-2), and the Tafel slope is very small in 1 M KOH, which is 62.8 mV dec(-1). The results show that bimetal/carbon nanosheets are potential catalysts for OER.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0044-2313	1521-3749		WOS:000726769100001

Herein, based on an economical and facile one-step surface sulfurization strategy, a three-dimensional nanostructure with uniform Fe-doped Ni3S2 nanoparticle arrays tightly implanted on nickel foam (Fe-doped Ni3S2-NF) has been fabricated for the extremely efficient electrochemical oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Owing to the unique electronic structure modulation between Ni and Fe sites, and high interfacial charge communication during the electrocatalytic process, the optimal Fe-doped Ni3S2-NF electrode shows an excellent OER activity with ultralow overpotentials of 166 and 235 mV at 10 and 100 mA cm(-2) in alkaline solution, respectively, remarkably outcompeting the benchmark RuO2/NF and the overwhelming majority of the reported electrocatalysts. Furthermore, for overall water splitting, the Fe-doped Ni3S2-NF electrode as a bifunctional electrocatalyst assembled in a two-electrode device requires merely 1.56 V to gain a current density of 10 mA cm(-2). This study presents a universal surface engineering strategy to conveniently and economically remould commercial metal materials into efficient electrocatalysts for various electrochemical reactions.									11	0	0	0	0	0	11			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000612999200034	33433539

Herein, NiFe LDH@Ni (OH)(2)-z p-n heterostructure with abundant oxygen vacancies was successfully fabricated by multi-step strategy as electrodeposition and in-situ etching. NiFe LDH@Ni(OH)(2)-z p-n heterostructure can modulate the D-band center to optimize the adsorption energies of hydroxides, while oxygen vacancies also con-tributed to increasing the amount of active sites and reducing charge transfer resistance during OER and UOR. In-situ UV-vis spectroscopy and Fourier transform a.c. voltammetry (FTACV) unveiled the surface reconstruction of NiFe LDH to generate Ni/FeOOH which facilitated the adsorption of the reaction inter-mediates and accelerated charge transfer during OER and UOR. As a result, NiFe LDH@Ni(OH)(2)-z presented the low overpotential of 250/290 mV at 100/200 mA cm(-2 ), small Tafel slope (43.6 mV dec-1) and excellent stability. The reaction order of OER with nearly unity indicated the fast adsorption process of OH-. NiFe LDH@Ni(OH)(2)-z also shows excellent electrocatalytic performance for UOR with 1.44 V at 100 mA cm(-2 )and Tafel slope of 37 mV dec(-1). This work offers a novel approach for the formation of p-n heterostructure with rich oxygen vacancies to engineer the electronic modulation and surface reconstruction for synergistically triggering OER and UOR.(c) 2022 Published by Elsevier B.V.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0925-8388	1873-4669		WOS:000828357000003

In particular, the influence of particle size and particle dispersion of noble metal catalysts and a possible influence of the support material can be studied in detail. Electrocatalytic reactions such as the hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR), the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) are important for technical applications. Hence, palladium and platinum as typical catalysts were investigated on Au(111) substrates regarding the HOR, HER and ORR. A significant increase in catalytic activity was found for Pd and Pt deposited on Au(111) where, with a decreasing amount of deposited metal, an increase of specific activity is observed which is contrary to expectations. A different behaviour was found for the ORR, where, according to expectations, the reactivity increases with increasing amounts of Pt. Parameters influencing the electrocatalytic activity of nanostructured surfaces, such as strain of the overlayers induced by the support and a possible direct involvement of the Au(111) surface in the mechanism of HER, are discussed.									35	1	0	0	1	0	35			0953-8984			WOS:000258734700029	21694434

Here, the authors find that some amino acid residues at the ligand sites of the Mn cluster can be posttranslationally converted to the original carboxylate residues, which could have contributed to the evolutionary process of photosynthetic oxygen evolution.Photosynthetic oxygen evolution is performed at the Mn cluster in photosystem II (PSII). The advent of this reaction on ancient Earth changed its environment by generating an oxygenic atmosphere. However, how oxygen evolution originated during the PSII evolution remains unknown. Here, we characterize the site-directed mutants at the carboxylate ligands to the Mn cluster in cyanobacterial PSII. A His residue replaced for D1-D170 is found to be post-translationally converted to the original Asp to recover oxygen evolution. Gln/Asn residues in the mutants at D1-E189/D1-D342 are also converted to Glu/Asp, suggesting that amino-acid conversion is a common phenomenon at the ligand sites of the Mn cluster. We hypothesize that post-translational generation of carboxylate ligands in ancestral PSII could have led to the formation of a primitive form of the Mn cluster capable of partial water oxidation, which could have played a crucial role in the evolutionary process of photosynthetic oxygen evolution.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1				2041-1723		WOS:000828703800005	35864123

Stabilization of single-atom catalysts on tungsten carbides without heteroatom coordination for efficient oxygen evolution reaction is demonstrated.Single-atom catalysts have shown promising performance in various catalytic reactions. Catalytic metal sites supported on oxides or carbonaceous materials are usually strongly coordinated by oxygen or heteroatoms, which naturally affects their electronic environment and consequently their catalytic activity. Here, we reveal the stabilization of single-atom catalysts on tungsten carbides without the aid of heteroatom coordination for efficient catalysis of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Benefiting from the unique structure of tungsten carbides, the atomic FeNi catalytic sites are weakly bonded with the surface W and C atoms. The reported catalyst shows a low overpotential of 237 mV at 10 mA cm(-)(2), which can even be lowered to 211 mV when the FeNi content is increased, a high turnover frequency value of 4.96 s(-1) (eta = 300 mV) and good stability (1,000 h). Density functional theory calculations show that either metallic Fe/Ni atoms or (hydro)oxide FeNi species are responsible for the high OER activity. We suggest that the application of inexpensive and durable WCx supports opens up a promising pathway to develop further single-atom catalysts for electrochemical catalytic reactions									76	0	0	0	8	0	76			1476-1122	1476-4660		WOS:000656435900001	34059814

Herein, the outstanding overall water splitting performance of a CuCo2O4 catalyst which is fabricated using a hydrothermal process is reported. The performance optimization is done through engineering the surface structure and size of the CuCo2O4 catalyst, without altering its chemical composition and crystallinity. Different solvents used in the hydrothermal growth tune the morphology of CuCo2O4 from porous 2-dimensional nanosheets through cubes and grains to agglomerated spheres. An optimized 2-dimensional nanosheet CuCo2O4 catalyst exhibits superior electrochemical performance for both hydrogen evolution reaction and oxygen evolution reaction, achieving the smallest overpotential of 115 and 290 mV versus a reversible hydrogen electrode, respectively, at 10 mA cm(-2) with excellent long-term stability under an alkaline electrolyte medium (1.0 m KOH). This highly stable and electrochemically active bifunctional electrocatalyst can deliver a cell voltage of 1.64 V at 10 mA cm(-2) under alkaline condition. Moreover, the correlation between electrochemical catalytic activity with solvent viscosity is manifested in the present study, which reveals that a change in morphologies causes the catalytically active surface area to vary and influences the intrinsic reaction kinetics.									25	0	0	0	1	0	25			2196-7350			WOS:000499693800001

The traditional understanding of the OER mechanism on metal oxides involves four concerted proton-electron transfer steps on metal-ion centres at their surface and product oxygen molecules derived from water. Here, using in situ O-18 isotope labelling mass spectrometry, we provide direct experimental evidence that the O-2 generated during the OER on some highly active oxides can come from lattice oxygen. The oxides capable of lattice-oxygen oxidation also exhibit pH-dependent OER activity on the reversible hydrogen electrode scale, indicating non-concerted proton-electron transfers in the OER mechanism. Based on our experimental data and density functional theory calculations, we discuss mechanisms that are fundamentally different from the conventional scheme and show that increasing the covalency of metal-oxygen bonds is critical to trigger lattice-oxygen oxidation and enable non-concerted proton-electron transfers during OER.									915	32	0	0	56	0	919			1755-4330	1755-4349		WOS:000399785500013	28430191

The PEIS results were analysed using a phenomenological approach since the mechanism of the oxygen evolution reaction is not known a priori. The results indicate that the photocurrent onset potential is strongly affected by Fermi level pinning since the rate constant for surface recombination is almost constant in this potential region. The phenomenological rate constant for electron transfer was found to increase with potential, suggesting that the potential drop in the Helmholtz layer influences the activation energy for the oxygen evolution process. The PEIS analysis also shows that the limiting factor determining the performance of the alpha-Fe2O3 photoanode is electron-hole recombination in the bulk of the oxide.									214	5	0	0	13	0	214			1463-9076			WOS:000288219700009

This structure can effectively increase the number of active sites participating in the reaction and enhance their catalytic properties. Therefore, in this work, single metal MOF (Co-MOF), single metal MOF with Cu through electrodeposition (Cu/Co-MOF), and double metal MOF (CuCo-MOF) in the case of the same ligand and metal ion were prepared by a hydrothermal method and electrodeposition, which were then applied in the electrocatalytic oxygen evolution reaction (OER). A group of electrochemical tests showed that as-prepared CuCo-MOF exhibited lowest Rct value, highest electron transfer capability, and the best catalytic performance among the three catalysts. When the current density was 10 mA cm(-2), the overpotential of CuCo-MOF was 0.38 V, and the slope of Tafel curve was 118 mV dec(-1). Moreover, the CuCo-MOF had larger TOF values and better electrocatalytic property as compared with the other two MOF materials. Therefore, the self-assembled acicular CuCo-MOF material prepared in this work has the advantages of low overpotential, small initial potential, and good stability.									7	0	0	0	0	0	7			0947-7047	1862-0760		WOS:000542715300001

However, how to mimic complex biological systems using simple biomolecular units remains a great challenge. Herein, we design and fabricate a biomimetic cyanobacteria model based on self-integration of small bioinspired molecules, including amphiphilic amino acid, 3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (DOPA), and metalloporphyrin and cobalt oxide nanoparticles (Co3O4 NPs), with the assistance of chemical conjugation and molecular self-assembly. The assembled amino acid fiber can be modified by DOPA to form covalently bound DOPA melanin containing hydroxyl and quinone species via Schiff base reaction. The adhering template can further tune the self-assembly of metalloporphyrin and Co3O4 NPs into J-aggregation and dispersive distribution, respectively, mainly via coordination binding. Metalloporphyrin molecules in the resulting hybrid fibers capture light; quinone species accept the excited electrons, and Co3O4 NPs catalyze water oxidation. Thus, the essential components of the photosystem-II protein complex in cyanobacteria are simplified and engineered into a simple framework, still retaining a similar photosynthetic mechanism. In addition, this architecture leads to efficient coupling of antenna, quinone-type reaction center, and photocatalyst, which increases the flux of light energy from antenna to reaction center for charge separation, resulting in enhanced oxygen evolution rate with excellent sustainability.									23	2	1	0	5	0	23			1936-0851	1936-086X		WOS:000418990200115	29195044

Traditional field-assisted dissolution theory has been put into question and oxygen bubble mold has been accepted gradually. However, it is difficult to prove oxygen release. In this work, we present a method to demonstrate the presence of oxygen in the pores of nanotubes. A kind of water soluble reducing agent (NH4H2PO2) was added into electrolyte containing NH4F. Cavities exists not only between the double walls of nanotubes but also in the inner walls, which are different from normal nanotubes. The morphology evolution of nanotubes results from the reaction between NH4H2PO2 and oxygen. Therefore, the release of oxygen during the formation of ATNTs was further proved.									7	1	0	0	0	0	8			1388-2481	1873-1902		WOS:000454898600007

Protonic or anionic ionomer dispersions were deposited on the electrodes to extend the interface with the electrolyte. The photo-anode consisted of a large band-gap Ti-oxide semiconductor. The effect of membrane characteristics on the photo-electrochemical conversion of solar energy was investigated for photo-voltage-driven electrolysis cells. Photo-electrolysis cells were also studied for operation under electrical bias-assisted mode. The pH of the membrane/ionomer had a paramount effect on the photo-electrolytic conversion. The anionic membrane showed enhanced performance compared to the Nafion (R)-based cell when just TiO2 anatase was used as photo-anode. This was associated with better oxygen evolution kinetics in alkaline conditions compared to acidic environment. However, oxygen evolution kinetics in acidic conditions were significantly enhanced by using a Ti sub-oxide as surface promoter in order to facilitate the adsorption of OH species as precursors of oxygen evolution. However, the same surface promoter appeared to inhibit oxygen evolution in an alkaline environment probably as a consequence of the strong adsorption of OH species on the surface under such conditions. These results show that a proper combination of photo-anode and polymer electrolyte membrane is essential to maximize photo-electrolytic conversion.									12	0	0	0	0	0	12				2077-0375		WOS:000404534400009	28468242

Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) and metal dichalcogenides (MDs) offer rich platforms for design of highly active electrocatalysts owing to their flexibility, ultrahigh surface area, hierarchical pore structures, and high catalytic activity. Herein, an advanced electrocatalyst based on a vertically aligned MoS2 nanosheet encapsulated Mo-N/C framework with interfacial Mo-N coupling centers is reported. The hybrid structure exhibits robust multifunctional electrocatalytic activity and stability toward the hydrogen evolution reaction, oxygen evolution reaction, and oxygen reduction reaction. Interestingly, it further displays high-performance of Zn-air batteries as a cathode electrocatalyst with a high power density of approximate to 196.4 mW cm(-2) and a voltaic efficiency of approximate to 63 % at 5 mA cm(-2), as well as excellent cycling stability even after 48 h at 25 mA cm(-2). Such outstanding electrocatalytic properties stem from the synergistic effect of the distinct chemical composition, the unique three-phase active sites, and the hierarchical pore framework for fast mass transport. This work is expected to inspire the design of advanced and performance-oriented MOF/MD hybrid-based electrocatalysts for wider application in electrochemical energy devices.									553	27	0	0	9	0	556			1616-301X	1616-3028		WOS:000416035400003

Although integration of two active components should be an effective method to produce the bifunctional catalysts in principle, traditional techniques still can not attain fine tunable surface structure during material-hybridization process. Herein, we present a facile short-time in-situ argon(Ar) plasma strategy to fabricate a high-performance bifunctional hybrid catalyst of vacancy-rich CoFe2O4 synergized with defective graphene(r-CoFe2O4@DG). Reflected by the low voltage gap of 0.79 V in two half-reaction measurements, the striking capability to catalyze ORR/OER endows it excellent and durable performance in rechargeable Zn-air batteries, with a maximum power density of 155.2 mW/cm(2) and robust stability(up to 60 h). Further experimental and theoretical studies validate its remarkable bifunctional energetics root from plasma-induced surface vacancy defects and interfacial charge polarization between DG and CoFe2O4. This work offers more opportunities for reliable clean energy systems by rational interfacial and defect engineering on catalyst design.									19	5	0	0	1	0	19			1005-9040	2210-3171		WOS:000528098600001

Recently, minimal amounts of single atoms (SAs) are exploited to maximize the active surface area and to tune the catalytic activity by coordinating the SAs in defect sites of N-doped graphene (G(N)). For the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution/reduction reactions (OER/ORR), we show high-performance 3d-5d transition metal (TM) SA catalysts using density functional theory (DFT) along with machine learning (ML)-based descriptors. We explore the stability and activity of TM-G(N) from the view of structure/coordination, formation energy, structural/electrochemical stability, electronic properties, electrical conductivity, and reaction mechanism, which have not been seriously explored yet. Among various -NnCm moieties, the -N2C2 moieties tend to be more easily formed and show higher electrochemical catalytic performance and longer durability (without aggregation/dissolution) compared with the widely studied pure -C-4/C-3 and -N-4/N-3 moieties. We found that some TM(SA)s favor a new OER/ORR mechanism, completely different from any known mechanism. The ML-based descriptors showing super HER/OER/ORR performances better than those of bench-mark noble metal catalysts are assessed. In the N2C2 templates, Ni/Ru/Rh/Pt show low HER overpotentials. Here, the H adsorption sites are shared by both the metal and C (not N), which was undiscussed in most of the previous literature where the H is attached on top of a metal atom. Low OER overpotentials are found for Pt/Ni-N2C2, Ni/Pd-C-4, and Rh-N-4, while low ORR overpotentials are found for Ir/Rh-N-4, Pd-C-4, Ru-N3C1 and Ni/Pd/Pt-N1C3. The present findings should help in designing high-performance SA catalysts for other various electrocatalytic reactions such as the ammonia evolution reaction.									61	0	0	0	0	0	59			1754-5692	1754-5706		WOS:000652643400001

However, these outstanding theoretical energy density performances cannot be achieved because undesirable sluggish oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) reaction kinetics on the air cathode side causes the high overpotential gap and low round-trip efficiencies during charge-discharge process. Therefore, the development of highly active bifunctional oxygen electrocatalysts is the key strategy to obtain the low overpotential gap with high energy density performance of Na-air batteries. In this work, a novel single crystalline thallium ruthenium oxide (Tl2Ru2O7) with pyrochlore structure was firstly revealed as an effective bifunctional electrocatalyst. Moreover, in order to enhance the surface chemical reactivity of Tl2Ru2O7, the surface of Tl2Ru2O7 is functionalized by using the di hydrogen phosphate ion (P-Tl2Ru2O7) for achieving the effective and rapid charge transfer behavior. The superior bifunctional catalytic activity of P-Tl2Ru2O7 can be explained by the degree of covalency of Ru-O bonds in Tl2Ru2O7 and enhanced covalent character by functionalized dihydrogen phosphate ion, which can afford favorable oxidation nature to Tl and Ru ions.									21	1	0	0	1	0	21			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000467661700004

Herein, a low-cost bimetallic phospho-boride catalyst was developed that showed outstanding OER activity of approximately 195 mV to achieve 10 mA cm(-2) in alkaline water electrolysis, with a minimal catalyst loading of 0.3 mg cm(-2). The contrasting electron transfer property of the metal borides and phosphides when combined in phospho-boride modulated the electron density of the Co atom, yielding highly active CoOOH species at lower potentials. The addition of Mo at low levels further enhanced the activity by increasing the surface area and by formation of nano-crystalline domains. The combined contributions from each of the components resulted in a new benchmark mass activity of 666 A g(-1) at 300 mV overpotential. This work presents a new avenue towards fabricating electrode materials with exceptional performances.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			1864-5631	1864-564X		WOS:000588036700001	33112493

However, p-p type heterojunction OER catalysts have obtained less attention, and the corresponding catalytic mechanisms are unclear either. Herein, the self-supported CoP-CoO p-p type heterojunction arrays are fabricated on carbon cloth substrate (CoP-CoO/CC). Band structure analysis shows that the formation of p-p heterojunction can drive the electrons from CoO to flow into CoP. This electronic modulation contributes to positively charged regions on the CoO and enhances the OH- adsorption during OER, proven by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and methanol molecular detection, respectively. As a result, the CoP-CoO/CC electrode only needs 210 mV overpotential to drive a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) in an alkaline medium, superior to the most reported OER catalysts. Additionally, the CoP-CoO/CC also exhibits an ideal hydrogen evolution reaction response, and a water splitting system has been successfully constructed which can drive a 10 mA cm(-2) within 1.65 V. This study supplies insight for catalytic origins p-p type heterojunctions OER catalyst, which provides a reference value for the efficient and reasonable design of heterojunction catalysts.

In this work, the oxygen reaction in the presence of potassium ions in dimethyl sulfoxide was exploited as a model system to refine the present mechanistic picture of oxygen reduction in aprotic environments. In a combined approach utilizing differential electrochemical mass spectrometry in a generator-collector arrangement as well as classical electrochemical techniques, the reversible formation of insoluble peroxide as well as of slightly soluble superoxide is shown. As opposed to other peroxides in other non-aqueous metal-oxygen systems, potassium peroxide can be reoxidized to superoxide with an overpotential of as little as 100 mV. The investigation of the effect of the oxygen partial pressure between 0 and 1 atmosphere demonstrates how the precipitation of superoxide increases the oxidation overpotential of the peroxide and establishes a link between this work and other studies, in which the reversibility of the peroxide formation has not been identified.									10	1	0	0	0	0	11			1463-9076	1463-9084		WOS:000461722500015	30724276

Here we investigate the OER activity of Au-Fe nanoalloys obtained by laser-ablation synthesis in solution. This method allows a high amount of iron (up to 11 at%) to be incorporated into the gold lattice, which is not possible in Au-Fe alloys synthesized by other routes, due to thermodynamic constraints. The Au0.89Fe0.11 nanoalloys exhibit strongly enhanced OER in comparison to the individual pure metal nanoparticles, lowering the onset of OER and increasing up to 20 times the current density in alkaline aqueous solutions. Such a remarkable electrocatalytic activity is associated to nanoalloying, as demonstrated by comparative examples with physical mixtures of gold and iron nanoparticles. These results open attractive scenarios to the use of kinetically stable nanoalloys for catalysis and energy conversion.									59	2	0	0	1	0	60			1433-7851	1521-3773		WOS:000401791900041	28464431

Exposing as many active sites as possible is the key method to improve activity of HER and OER performance. In this communication, we demonstrate a novel 3D hierarchical network NiCo(2)S(4)nanoflake grown on Ni foam (NiCo2S4-NF) as a highly efficient and stable electrochemical catalyst. The NiCo2S4-NF exhibits overpotentials as low as 289 and 409 mV at 100 mA cm(-2), superior long-term durability during a 20 h measurement, and a low Tafel slope of 89 and 91 mV dec(-1) for HER and OER in 1.0 M NaOH solution. The outstanding performance is owe to the inherent activity of ultrathin NiCo2S4 nanoflakes and the special structure of NiCo2S4-NP that can provide a huge number of exposed active sites, accelerate the transfer of electrons, and facilitate the diffusion of electrolyte simultaneously.

Herein, Mo-doped NiFe-layered double hydroxides/NiSe heterostructure (Mo-NiFe LDH/NiSe) was fabricated by coupling Mo-doped NiFe LDH and NiSe on nickel foam (NF). The heterostructure electrocatalyst showed ultra-low overpotential (250 mV) and remarkable durability for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) at 150 mA cm(-2). Both theoretical and experimental results confirmed that Mo doping and interfacial synergism induced the interfacial charge redistribution and the lifted d-band center to weaken the energy barrier (EB) of the formation of OOH*. Mo doping also facilitated the surface reconstruction of NiFe LDH into Ni(Fe)OOH as the active sites under electro-oxidation process. This work provides a facile strategy for electronic modulation and surface reconstruction of OER electrocatalyst by transition metal doping and heterostructure generation.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1864-5631	1864-564X		WOS:000855116400001	36043340

Consistently, O-2 evolution from acid solution (H2SO4), for precious metal oxide contents > 10%, proceeds with kinetic parameters close to those of pure IrO2. The Tafel slope, IR-drop, reaction order (H+ and surface sites), electrocatalytic activity and stability have been scrutinized as functions of active layer composition. A reaction mechanism has been proposed. For some of the compositions the effect of the solution temperature was also investigated. The kinetics of O-2 evolution appear to conform to the 'standard' Butler-Volmer model. IrO2+SnO2 electrodes were found to be stable under O-2 evolution within the time scale of the present work.

Performance was evaluated by turnover frequency at 50% conversion and by absolute turnover number, and the most promising precatalysts were studied further. Molecular turnover frequencies varied from 190 to 451 per hour with a maximum turnover number of 38 000. While the rate of oxygen evolution depends linearly on iridium concentration, concurrent spectroscopic and manometric observations following stoichiometric oxidant additions suggest oxygen evolution is limited by two sequential first-order reactions. Under the applied conditions, the oxygen evolving species appears to be a well-defined and molecular species based on kinetic analyses, effects of careful ligand design, reproducibility, and the absence of persistent dynamic light scattering signals. Outside of these conditions, the complex mechanism is highly dependent on reaction conditions. While confident characterization of the catalytically active species is difficult, especially under high-turnover conditions, this work strongly suggests the primary active species under these conditions is a molecular species.									92	1	0	0	7	0	93			1754-5692	1754-5706		WOS:000337977600024

However, the pursuit of low cost, energetic efficient and robust bifunctional catalysts for OER and ORR remains a great challenge. Herein, the novel Na-ion-deficient Na2-xCoP2O7 catalysts are proposed to efficiently electrocatalyze OER and ORR in alkaline solution. The engineering of Na-ion deficiency can tune the electronic structure of Co, and thus tailor the intrinsically electrocatalytic performance. Among the sodium cobalt phosphate catalysts, the Na1.95CoP2O7 (NCPO5) catalyst exhibits the lowest Delta E (E-J10,E-OER-E-J-1,E-ORR) of only 0.86 V, which favorably outperforms most of the reported non-noble metal catalysts. Moreover, the Na-ion deficiency can stabilize the phase structure and morphology of NCPO5 during the OER and ORR processes. This study highlights the Na-ion deficient Na2-xCoP2O7 as a promising class of low-cost, highly active and robust bifunctional catalysts for OER and ORR.									9	1	0	0	0	0	9			0947-6539	1521-3765		WOS:000479847900001	31237958

Hence, herein, we report the preparation, characterization and application of three composites based on doped, multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNT_N6) and three different POMs (Na-12[(FeOH2)(2)Fe-2(As2W15O56)(2)]center dot 54H(2)O, Na-12[(NiOH2)(2)Ni-2(As2W15O56)(2)]center dot 54H(2)O and Na-14[(FeOH2)(2)N-i2(As2W15O56)(2)]center dot 55H(2)O) as ORR and OER electrocatalysts in alkaline medium (pH = 13). Overall, the three POM@MWCNT_N6 composites showed good ORR performance with onset potentials between 0.80 and 0.81 V vs. RHE and diffusion-limiting current densities ranging from -3.19 to -3.66 mA cm(-2). Fe-4@MWCNT_N6 and Fe2Ni2@MWCNT_N6 also showed good stability after 12 h (84% and 80% of initial current). The number of electrons transferred per O-2 molecule was close to three, suggesting a mixed regime. Moreover, the Fe2Ni2@MWCNT_N6 presented remarkable OER performance with an overpotential of 0.36 V vs. RHE (for j = 10 mA cm(-2)), a j(max) close to 135 mA cm(-2) and fast kinetics with a Tafel slope of 45 mV dec(-1). More importantly, this electrocatalyst outperformed not only most POM@carbon-based composites reported so far but also the state-of-the-art RuO2 electrocatalyst. Thus, this work represents a step forward towards bifunctional electrocatalysts using less expensive materials.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0				2073-4344		WOS:000785416400001

Herein, we present a versatile anion-exchange based strategy to fabricate various amorphous transition metal oxide hollow nanoprisms with FeCo-MIL-88B template, which exhibit highly efficient OER catalysis in alkaline media. Impressively, a low overpotential of 294 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) with an ultrasmall Tafel slope of 45.1 mV dec(-1) and decent durability can be achieved. More importantly, the underlying origin is unraveled using the in-situ Raman spectroscopy measurement combined with the ex-situ X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy anlysis, where the electrochemically transformed metal hydroxide and oxyhydroxide species could be the real active species. This work provides a universal strategy to construct transition metal oxide hollow nanostructures with enhanced OER activity, which could push forward the advance of noble metal free electrocatalytic water splitting.									42	1	0	0	3	0	42			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000517665200036

In this work, we synthesize hierarchical N-doped carbon microspheres with porous yolk-shell structure (NCYS) as a metal-free electrocatalyst toward efficient oxygen reduction through a template-free route. The enhanced oxygen reduction performances in both alkaline and acid media profit well from the porous yolk-shell structure as well as abundant nitrogen functional groups. Furthermore, such yolk-shell microspheres can be used as precursor materials to motivate the oxygen reduction activity of oxygen evolution oriented materials to obtain a desirable bifunctional electrocatalyst. To verify its practical utility, Zn-air battery tests are conducted and exhibit satisfactory performance, indicating that this constructed concept for preparation of bi-functional catalyst will afford a promising strategy for exploring novel metal-air battery electrocatalysts.									5	0	0	0	1	0	5			0957-4484	1361-6528		WOS:000407865300002	28590255

Here, we report a support-stabilized catalyst, the activated similar to 200 nm-depth IrW nanochannel that achieves the current density of 2 A cm(-2) at an overpotential of only similar to 497 mV and maintains ultrastable gas evolution at 100 mA cm(-2) at least 800 h with a negligible degradation rate of similar to 4 mu Vh(-1). Structure analyses combined with theoretical calculations indicate that the IrW support alters the charge distribution of surface (IrO2) n clusters and effectively confines the cluster size within 4 (n=4). Such support-stabilizing effect prevents the surface Ir from agglomeration and retains a thin layer of electrocatalytically active IrO2 clusters on surface, realizing a winwin strategy for ultrahigh OER activity and stability. This work would open up an opportunity for engineering suitable catalysts for robust proton exchange membrane-based electrolyzers.									28	0	0	0	1	0	28			2041-1723			WOS:000663747800030	34112770

A 3D porous nitrogen-doped graphene encapsulated metallic Ni3Fe alloy nanoparticles aerogel (Ni3Fe-GA(1)) was constructed through a facile hydrothermal assembly and calcination process. Benefiting from 3D porous configuration with great accessibility, high electrical conductivity, abundant active sites, optimal nitrogen content and strong electronic interactions at the Ni3Fe/N-doped graphene heterointerface, the obtained aerogel showed outstanding catalytic performance toward the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). Specifically, it exhibited an overpotential of 239 mV to attain 10 mA cm(-2) for OER, simultaneously providing a positive onset potential of 0.93 V within a half-wave potential of 0.8 V for ORR. Accordingly, when employed in the aqueous ZABs, Ni3Fe-GA(1) achieved higher power density and superior reversibility than Pt/C-IrO2 catalyst, making it a potential candidate for rechargeable ZABs.									14	1	0	0	1	0	14			0947-6539	1521-3765		WOS:000514235200001	31903653

The exfoliated black phosphorus (EBP) nanosheet with a two-dimensional (2D) layered structure has high carrier mobility but is limited by excessive oxygen-containing intermediate absorption and fast deterioration in air. We here report the fabrication of nanohybrids of amorphous CoFeB nanosheets on EBP nanosheets (EBP/CoFeB). The 2D/2D heterostructure, thanks to the electronic interactions and oxygen affinity difference between EBP and CoFeB nanosheets, is capable of balancing the oxygen-containing intermediate absorption to an optimal status for facilitating the OER process. While the crystalline EBP contributes to the improved conductivity, the amorphous coating protects EBP and thus ensures the catalytic stability. The EBP/CoFeB electrocatalyst shows excellent OER performance with an ultralow overpotential of 227 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) with an ultrasmall Tafel slope of 36.7 mV dec(-1) with excellent stability. This study may inspire more researches to develop heterostructured nanohybrid electrocatalysts for a diversity of electrochemical reactions.									25	0	0	0	1	0	25			1936-0851	1936-086X		WOS:000679406500127	34259511

In recent years, introducing oxygen defects via various strategies emerged as an efficient way to increase electro-catalytic activity of TMO. Despite many successful examples, the physical and chemical origin of such enhanced OER activity induced by oxygen defects is still not well understood. In this work, we systematically investigate the correlation between the concentration of oxygen vacancies and OER activity by using a NiO thin film model system grown by pulsed laser deposition. Oxygen vacancies are introduced into NiO thin films by Ar plasma treatments with different power (50 W, 100 W, and 150 W). The OER activities of NiO thin films are found to be significantly enhanced after plasma treatment. The improvement in electrochemical OER performance is attributed to the creation of oxygen defects, which lead to the strongly modified surface adsorption properties, as confirmed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and contact angle measurements. Our results demonstrate that plasma treatment as a promising method for precisely tuning physical and chemical properties of TMO through oxygen defects engineering to obtain high performance electro-catalysts.

The catalyst activity was screened by linear scanning cyclic voltammetry (LSV), Tafel curves, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). A group of electrochemical tests for LaNixFe1-xO3 with various Ni/Fe ratios indicate that LaNi0.8Fe0.2O3 catalyst exhibits excellent electrochemical activity, with a resistance to charge-transfer reaction (R-ct) of 5.942 Omega cm(-2), overpotential of 391 mV, a Tafel slope of 102.8 mV dec(-1), and electrochemical double-layer capacitance (C-dl) of 12.31 mF cm(-1). The stability test after 15000 s proves that the optimized LaNi0.8Fe0.2O3 has better stability compared to pristine LaFeO3 and LaNiO3. In addition, LaNi0.8Fe0.2O3 also exhibits the largest electrochemical active area (ECSA = 307.75 cm(2)) and exchange current density (j(o) = 1.08 mA cm(-2)).

Herein, we report a highly efficient, robust tri-functional catalytic electrode that simultaneously catalyzes three different electrochemical reactions: the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). The catalytic electrodes with a hierarchical structure are converted from a hierarchical nickel-rich, nickel-cobalt bimetallic-imidazolate framework directly grown onto a nickel foam. Catalytic electrodes composed of bimetallic phosphides exhibit excellent OER and HER catalytic activity (an overpotential of 201/250 mV at 20/100 mA cm(-2) for OER and an overpotential of 67/110 mV at 20/100 mA cm(-2) for HER), as well as ORR activity with a half-wave potential at 0.82 V vs. RHE. Furthermore, the bimetal-nitrogen-carbon (M-N-C) catalytic electrode also exhibits tunable tri-functional catalytic activity, including excellent ORR activity with a half-wave potential at 0.88 V vs. RHE. The high potential of these multi-functional electrocatalysts from single nickel-rich bimetallic-organic complexes is demonstrated by employing them as robust alkaline water electrolyzers, as well as decoupled air electrodes for rechargeable zinc-air batteries (ZABs).									31	1	0	0	2	0	31			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000464414200066

The structure, morphology and valence state of the prepared samples were characterized. Their catalytic activities toward oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) were investigated by rotating-disk electrode (RDE). As expected, appropriate introduce of A-site deficiency can enhance both ORR and OER activities. Among the A-site cation deficient perovskites studied, (La0.8Sr0.2)0.95MnO3 exhibited the highest ORR and OER activities and, hence, the best bifunctionality. After doping with Fe in the B-site, the (La0.8Sr0.2)0.95Mn0.5Fe0.5O3 perovskite exhibits even better electrochemical catalytic activity which is due to the increase of the concentration of oxygen vacancy as compared with (La0.8Sr0.2)0.95MnO3. Furthermore, (La0.8Sr0.2)0.95Mn0.5Fe0.5O3 showed superior durability than commercial 20wt% Pt/C catalyst. This work indicates that introduce of A-site deficiency and B-site Fe doping in perovskite oxides is an effective strategy to enhance ORR and OER activity for the applications in metal-air batteries.

Here, we propose a strategy of killing two birds with one stone to construct the efficient bifunctional electrocatalyst by simultaneously accelerating water dissociation and enhancing oxygen evolution. The self-supported tungsten nitride nanowires decorated with tungsten cobalt alloy nanoparticles (Co3W/WN/CC) were synthesized on the flexible carbon cloth. Co3W can act as both a water dissociation promoter to enhance HER activity and OER active species to facilitate water oxidation via in situ transformation, thus effectively improving the overall water splitting performance. As expected, compared with pure tungsten nitride catalysts, the hybrid electrocatalyst not only shows enhanced HER activity with an overpotential decrease from 255 to 43 mV, but also achieves an excellent OER performance with overpotential of 273 mV in 1 M KOH aqueous solution. Furthermore, by employing Co3W/WN/CC as cathode and anode, the overall water splitting process needs 1.582 V to drive a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) and maintains without decay for 80 hours. This work expands the effective strategy for building efficient, stable and low-cost alkaline bifunctional electrocatalysts.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			2196-0216			WOS:000605216400018

Perovskites are emerging as a new research frontier for oxygen electrocatalysis, yet lack the equivalent activity to noble metals. Herein, we report an easy-to-use surface chemistry approach to activating the perovskite electrocatalysis of both ORR and OER. Using this approach, we exemplify that a perovskite oxide, such as La0.45Sr0.45Mn0.9Fe0.1O3-delta, could be engineered into a three-components- integrated catalyst (i.e., LaSrMnO/Fe3C/Carbon). Building on this, we present an efficient, affordable, tunable and robust catalyst that enables several folds enhanced activities for ORR and OER and thus achieves the best of both worlds. More generally, such a methodology provides a convenient route to boost a variety of perovskite oxide materials for clean energy storage and conversion, environmental protection, industrial production and much more.									39	1	0	0	2	0	39			2211-2855	2211-3282		WOS:000434829500015

The photoactivity of the OER is further boosted by the photodeposition of cobalt phosphate (CoPi) layers onto the surface of the ZnTaO2N photoanodes. Structural, morphological, and photoelectrochemical (PEC) properties of the modified ZnTaO2N photoanodes are studied using X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), ultraviolet visible (UV-Vis) diffuse reflectance spectroscopy, and electrochemical techniques. The presence of the CoPi layer significantly improved the PEC performance of water oxidation in an alkaline sulphate solution. The photocurrent-voltage behavior of the CoPi-modified ZnTaO2N anodes was improved, with the influence being more prominent at lower oxidation potentials. A stable photocurrent density of about 2.3 mA.cm(-2) at 1.23 V vs. RHE was attained upon visible light illumination. Relative to the ZnTaO2N photoanodes, an almost three-fold photocurrent increase was achieved at the CoPi/ZnTaO2N photoelectrode. Perovskite-based oxynitrides are modified using an oxygen-evolution co-catalyst of CoPi, and provide a new dimension for enhancing the photoactivity of oxygen evolution in solar-assisted water-splitting reactions.									11	0	0	0	0	0	11				2079-4991		WOS:000424131600047	29346306

In addition, these materials show competitive overpotentials for hydrogen evolution with a modified Watts bath as a binder for the Raney nickel. The optimum result was -190mV of overpotential at 100mAcm(-2). Oxygen in the Raney Ni catalyst affects its electroactivity toward hydrogen evolution. The source of oxygen is related to the presence of chloride ions in the modified Watts bath. A Watts bath binds Raney Ni particles to the surface of the catalysts and chloride regulates the oxygen content in the nickel binder during electrodeposition. High oxygen content increases the hydrogen evolution overpotential of the electrode. The electroactivity of the synthesized porous coatings was evaluated by polarization curves and impedance plots. In addition, surface characterization by X-ray diffraction, field emission-scanning electron microscopy equipped with energy-dispersive analysis, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy is reported.									13	0	0	0	1	0	13			0003-2719	1532-236X		WOS:000413972000004

Here, we reported a reductive H2 plasma surface modification strategy, where a defect-rich amorphous NiFe coating layer can be anchored and interact with porous Co3O4 nanoarrays. The plasma-modified surface can promote the reconstruction process to generate high-valence and ultra-active species, thus forming abundant active centers and oxygen vacancies with high electrocatalytic activity. The H2-NiFe/ Co3O4 composite reveals excellent bifunctional electrocatalytic ability, and ultralow overpotentials of 233 and 273 mV are required to reach 100 and 1000 mA cm-2, respectively, for oxygen evolution, while the urea oxidation reaction (UOR) requires the potentials of 1.315 and 1.420 V to reach 10 and 1000 mA cm-2, respectively. The superior electrocatalytic stability is confirmed by a 240 h long-term test at 1 A cm-2 for the oxygen evolution reaction and the consecutive multistep chronoamperometric tests for the UOR. This work provides an easily scalable and energy-efficient surface modification method to fabricate a robust bifunctional catalyst, while the atomic species and configuration can also be flexibly adjusted, which is suitable to be extended to various application fields.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0888-5885			WOS:000874257400001

Well single crystalline features of these Co3O4 nanocrystals were confirmed by FESEM and HRTEM analyses. The electrochemical performance for Li-O-2 batteries shows that Co3O4 nanocrystals can significantly reduce the discharge-charge over-potential via the effect on the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). From the comparison on their catalytic performances, we found that the essential factor to promote the oxygen evolution reactions is the surface crystal planes of Co3O4 nanocrystals, namely, crystal planes-dependent process. The correlation between different Co3O4 crystal planes and their effect on reducing charge-discharge over-potential was established: {100} < {110} < {112} < {111}.									175	14	0	0	16	0	182			2045-2322			WOS:000341022500001	25169737

In this paper, such a carbon catalyst is prepared through a chemical vapor deposition (CVD)-supported precursor pyrolysis. Compared with the direct pyrolysis of polypyrrole@cobalt salt precursor, the incorporation of dicyanodiamide as the CVD source facilitates the diversification and hierarchization of carbon morphology, the reduction of Co particle size, and the increase of the proportion of interfacial Co-N-C and pyridinic-N. The catalyst is composed of in-situ-grown multiple-morphology carbons (MMCs) with metallic Co particles embedded, where the MMCs are a combination of nano-particles, -rods, and -wires, all comprised by small N-doped carbon nanoflakes. Owing to the combined modulation on morphology configurations and defect states, the Co/MMCs catalyst demonstrates excellent activities toward hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), oxygen evolution reaction (OER), and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). A half-wave potential of 0.84 V and low overpotentials of 86 and 180 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) current density for HER and OER are achieved, respectively. Additionally, the catalyst also demonstrates favorable prospects for large-scale applications in overall water splitting and Zn-air battery.									14	1	0	0	1	0	14			2196-0216			WOS:000485947800022

In this work, we fabricated CoFe-layered double hydroxide (LDH) nanowire arrays on graphite felt (CoFe-LDH/GF) via a hydrothermal method. The CoFe-LDH/GF, as a robust integrated 3D OER anode, exhibits excellent catalytic activity with the need of low overpotential of 252 and 285 mV to drive current densities of 10 and 100 mA/cm(2) in 1.0 mol/L KOH, respectively. In addition, it also maintains electrochemical durability for at least 24 h. This work would open up avenues for the development of GF like attractive catalyst supports for oxygen evolution applications.

We perform first principles calculations using a seven-atom Au cluster supported on a reduced TiO2 surface to explore potential candidates for the form of reactive oxygen. These calculations suggest a thermodynamically favorable path for O-2 diffusion along the surface Ti row, resulting in its dissociated state bound to Au cluster and TiO2 surface. CO can approach along the same path and react with the O-2 so dissociated to form CO2. The origin of the slow kinetic evolution of products observed in experiments is also investigated and is attributed to the strong binding of CO2 simultaneously to the Au cluster and the surface.

The oxidation current of the composite increases significantly under visible light irradiation, resulting in a dramatic drop in the overpotential to 180 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2). The Z-scheme heterostructure with efficient charge separation promotes photogenerated electron transfer from NiFe(2)O(4)to NiFe-LDH, leading to the formation of an electron-rich Ni and Fe sites in NiFe-LDH and abundant photogenerated holes left in NiFe2O4, which are responsible for the improved electrocatalytic performance.

Thanks to oxygen functional groups on oCF, vertical WS2 nanosheets structures have grown more easily on oCF, which can provide better dispersion, short charge transfer distance and more exposed active sites for HER in comparison with bulk WS2 and WS2 nanosheets on bare carbon fiber (CF) fabricated at the same condition. The electrochemical measurements confirmed that WS2/oCF possesses better HER activity than bulk WS2 and WS2/CF. Especially, the 10-h stability with unchanged vertical WS2 nanosheets morphology further demonstrate the positive effect of oxygen functional groups on the enhanced vertical structure and close combination between WS2 and oCF.

Herein, for the first time, we report a ldquorigid and flexiblerdquo material consisting of three-dimensional (3D) porous nickel-manganese oxide (Ni6MnO8) coupled with 1D ultrathin Au nanowires (Au-NWs) as an efficient bifunctional oxygen electrocatalyst, adopting alpha-naphthol-Au(III) as a precursor of Au-NWs and pre-formed Ni6MnO8 as a support. Ni6MnO8 acts not only as a robust carbon-free support that is stable in alkaline electrochemical conditions, but also as a highly active component for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), while flexible Au-NWs contribute to the excellent oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activity and act as a flexible conductive electronic network. The coupling of Ni6MnO8 and Au-NWs plays a complementary role in the two types of oxygen electrocatalytic reactions. Accordingly, their advantages have been optimally harnessed while overcoming their deficiencies. Moreover, a Zn-air battery assembled with such a rigid and flexible air-cathode has lower charge and discharge overpotentials and a higher cyclic stability than those with a mixed Pt/C+RuO2 catalyst.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1884-4049			INSPEC:18730440

However, it is challenging to synthesize atomically dispersed electrocatalysts with high density and high performance. Herein, an integrated g-C3N4-C-TiO2 heterostructural nanosphere with oxygen-rich vacancies is constructed by a multicomponent assembly-calcination strategy. Abundant single Ru atoms (12.4 wt %) are then anchored via the occupation of partial oxygen vacancies, forming a unique Ru/g-C3N4-C-TiO2 heterostructure. A reasonable configuration is developed including single Ru atoms bonded with two oxygens and two nitrogens and coupled with jacent oxygen vacancies on the g-C3N4-C-TiO2 nanosphere. Density functional theory calculations reveal that the remaining oxygen vacancies are beneficial for water dissociation, while single Ru atoms facilitate hydrogen adsorption. As expected, the result exhibits high electrocatalytic activity, delivering overpotentials of 112 and 107 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) , Tafel slopes of 83 and 65 mV dec(-1) in H2SO4 and KOH, and a turnover frequency of 0.28 H-2 s(-1) at -100 mV toward the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Benefiting from the outstanding electrocatalytic performance, such a unique heterostructure with dense single Ru sites and oxygen vacancies could serve as a prominent alternative HER catalyst for renewable energy applications.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000706187100037	34550694

In this work, the electronic properties and catalytic performance of M1M2/NC (M = Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu and Zn, random combination in pairs) is studied by density functional theory, the calculated results show that the overpotential of FeCu/NC is 0.88 V, which is used as the optimal catalyst to further study the OER reaction mechanism. Combined with the volcano map and the d-band center position, the low overpotential of FeCu/NC is because it has a more suitable position of d-band center 1.806 eV than other materials. Moreover, the calculation results show that the density of states (DOS) of iron-containing materials is stronger than that of other materials near the Fermi level, which can promote the catalytic reaction. In addition, *OOH and *OH, *OH and * O linearly related theoretical equations are proposed, respectively. Furthermore, the analysis of the catalytic mechanism shows that the formation of the catalytic rate-determining step is affected by the movement of the d-band center, the distance of the transition state adsorption and the electric field.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			1093-3263	1873-4243		WOS:000782989600001	34922331

However, the relatively sluggish charge transfer kinetics of transition metal LDHs due to their intrinsically low conductivity often hinders their use in practical applications as highperformance water oxidation catalysts. Here, we disclose a novel strategy of metalloid incorporation into transition metal LDHs, allowing us to simultaneously optimize surface electronic configuration and charge transfer between adsorbed reactants and catalyst surface. Importantly, incorporated metalloid can enhance the density of states (DOS) near the Fermi level and alter the nature of the chemical bonds in the catalytically active atoms, resulting in fast reaction kinetics. Thus, metalloid incorporation into transition metal LDHs can substantially improve the overall reaction kinetics and thermodynamics for water oxidation due to a large number of active sites and high conductivity, boosting OER performance of transition metal LDHs. The metalloid-incorporated transition metal LDHs far outperform their counterpart transition metal LDHs and even the noble metal catalyst RuO2.									29	1	0	0	0	0	29			2211-2855	2211-3282		WOS:000560729200013

However, the synergistic enhancement effect of different doping elements on the intrinsic OER activity is still obscure. In this study, the FeNi-codoped cobalt oxyhydroxide (CoOOH) as OER electrocatalyst was prepared suc-cessfully by simple electrodeposition and anodic oxidation methods, which exhibits su-perior OER activity to the single-metal doped CoOOH systems. Based on both experiments and first-principles calculations, the results show that the reaction kinetics enhance due to the codoping of Fe and Ni. Fe-doping changes the active site from Co to Fe and enhances the hydroxyl group adsorption. Ni doping benefits the electron transfer between Fe and intermediates, thereby enhancing the Fe-O covalent component to further balance the two steps of hydroxyl group adsorption and the deprotonation step. The essential mechanism of bimetal-doping in CoOOH provides theoretical support for the design and development of bimetal-doped Co-based OER catalysts. (c) 2022 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC.

In this contribution, less active CeO2 is introduced for regulating the ORR/OER bifunctional activity of Co3O4@N-doped carbon (NC). The introduced CeO2 plays essential roles in increasing the surface contents of Co2+, Co3+ and N species in CeO2/Co3O4@NC for ORR/OER processes, while still maintaining hierarchical porosity and large specific surface area. Furthermore, the surface acid-base properties for the adsorption of oxygen molecules (for the ORR) and activation of water molecules (for the OER) and the charge transfer efficiency are also improved by the introduced CeO2. As a result, significantly enhanced ORR/OER bifunctional activity is achieved for the optimal and desired electrocatalyst, i.e., CeO2/Co3O4@NC. Its bifunctional activity is comparable or even superior to that of the benchmarked 20 wt% Pt/C (for the ORR) and IrO2 (for the OER), respectively. In the applications of Zn-air batteries, the battery with CeO2/Co3O4@NC still exhibits higher performance than the battery with mixed 20 wt% Pt/C + IrO2, due to its outstanding bifunctional activity toward the ORR and OER.									61	4	0	0	0	0	61			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000463814800013

The performance of OX-ZEO is exceptional, while the mechanism is controversial. In this work, we have first developed an algorithm based on graph theory to establish a complete reaction network for syngas conversion to methanol, ketene, and methane. Combined with density functional theory (DFT) calculations, the activity and selectivity of syngas conversion over zinc oxide (ZnO) are systematically studied by a reaction phase diagram. The key intermediate, ketene, is observed in experiments, which has been first confirmed theoretically in this work. The evolution of ZnO surfaces is found to be a key factor of diverse product selectivity. It is found that methanol production is more favored over the ZnO surfaces with a low oxygen vacancy concentration. As the oxygen vacancy increases, the main product evolves gradually from methanol to ketene and finally to methane. Accordingly, the overall reaction activity increases too. Our prediction from the reaction phase diagram is finally verified by microkinetic modeling.									5	1	0	0	2	0	6			2155-5435			WOS:000704700800043

In this work, we utilized the gas-foaming way to synthesize uniformly dispersed Co nanoparticles (Co NPs) anchored on 3D spiral-like polyhedron N-doped porous carbon structure. The optimized catalyst (CoSP-850-10) delivers prominent ORR activity with half-wave potential of 0.85 V and kinetic current density of 27 mA cm(-2). Importantly, it also demonstrates satisfactory bifunctional performance with low overpotential. Furthermore, the Al-air battery with CoSP-850-10 offers remarkable specific capacity of 1670 mAh g(-1) at 200 mA cm(-2). The Zn-air battery delivers a stable working voltage of 1.25 V at 10 mA cm(-2) and remarkable rechargeable performance with high initial cycle efficiency of 60.5% and long-term stability under 20 mA cm(-2).y									8	0	0	0	0	0	8			0378-7753	1873-2755		WOS:000598111300001

Here, an in situ growth strategy is developed to synthesize a new type of composite with carbon nanotubes (CNTs) supported on the surface of Ti3C2Tx MXene (Co/N-CNTs@Ti3C2Tx) as bifunctional electrocatalyst toward oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER). By combining the X-ray photoelectron detection with synchrotron-based soft X-ray spectroscopic characterizations, the strong interfacial coupling and electron transfer are efficiently identified, which can effectively facilitate the bifunctional electrocatalytic performance of Co/N-CNTs@Ti3C2Tx toward ORR and OER in alkaline solution. The present strategy provides a facile route for the design of the hybrids of CNTs and MXene for bifunctional electrocatalysis.									66	4	0	0	3	0	68			2196-7350			WOS:000442489600013

Here, a new method is used for developing Cu-doped ZIF-67 (Cu/ZIF-67) nanoparticles and carbonizing at various temperatures (500 degrees C-900 degrees C). Benefiting from the doping of Cu nanoparticles on the surface of the ZIF-67 and the synergistic interaction between Cu and the underlying Co atoms, the Cu/Co-NC-800 electrocatalyst exhibits superior electrocatalytic activity for both ORR (E-o 0.98, E-1/2 0.84 V) and OER (overpotential 0.278 V) and superior alkaline media stability relative to both prepared and commercial Pt/C (E-o 0.96 V). These insightful findings inspire new perspectives for economical-practical bifunctional oxygen electrocatalysts to be designed and synthesized rationally.

It also poses big challenges due to the impact of the high energy electron beam. In this article, we present an ETEM study of a Pr0.64Ca0.36MnO3 (PCMO) thin filth electrocatalySt for water splitting and Oxygen evolution in contact with water vapor: We show by means of off-axis electron holography and electrostatic modeling that the electron beam gives rise to a positive electric sample potential due to secondary electron emission. The value of the electric potential depends on the primary electron flux, the sample's electric Conductivity and grounding, and gas properties. We present evidence that two observed electrochemical reactions are driven by a beam induced electrostatic potential of the order of a volt. The first reaction is an anodic oxidation of oxygen depleted amorphous PCMO which results in recrystallization of the oxide. The Second reaction is oxygen evolution which can be detected by the oxidation of a silane additive and formation of SiO2-gamma at catalytically active surfaces. The quantification of beam induced potentials is an important step for future controlled electrochemical experiments in an ETEM.									32	0	0	0	3	0	32			1932-7447			WOS:000351189100006

Herein, we report a hierarchical assembly strategy to controllably synthesize a series of doped carbon/Co-based nanocomposites with tunable morphologies and compositions. During the synthesis, a variation of urea/thiourea mass ratio exerts a dramatic effect on final nanostructures, ranging from hollow nanotube, nanosheet to nanospring. Meanwhile, Co species are successfully regulated from Co single atoms, Co nanoparticles (NPs) to Co9S8 NPs. The controllable tunability allows the optimization of trifunctional electrocatalytic performance and the establishment of structure/compositionproperty relationships for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), oxygen evolution reaction (OER), and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Among the as-obtained materials, the heterostructure of hollow carbon nanotubes/ reduced graphene oxide doped with N/S and decorated with Co9S8 NPs (Co9S8-HCT) shows superior electrocatalytic activity and long-term stability for ORR, OER, and HER in alkaline medium. Experimental and theoretical results show that the electrocatalytic promotion comes from the electronic modulation of Co9S8 from N,Scodoped nanocarbon.									9	0	0	0	1	0	9			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000655663700001

However, their hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and overall water splitting performance are not satisfactory. Herein, we report a facile cation doping combined with plasma reduction strategy to generate heterostructured Ni nanoparticles/V-doped NiFe LDH nanosheet array with multiple vacancies, exhibiting excellent HER performance with a small overpotential of 19 mV at 10 mA cm(-2). Moreover, when evaluated as bi-functional electrocatalyst for overall water splitting, a small cell voltage (1.43 V at 10 mA cm(-2)) and ultralong stability (over 1000 h) are achieved. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that V-doping, oxygen vacancy (O-v) Ni vacancy (Ni-v), and Ni nanoparticles can effectively improve the conductivity and optimize the hydrogen adsorption, O-v, Ni-v, and Ni nanoparticles help to facilitate H2O adsorption and dissociation progress in HER, the V-doping and O-v, can efficiently reduce the energy barrier of O* in OER, and Ni/NiFe LDH heterostructure ameliorates the electronic structure and tunes electron transfer route.									131	4	0	0	11	0	131			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000517665200016

Mesoporous carbon-coated nickel phosphide (NiP) nano particles were successfully synthesized by thermal decomposition at 500 degrees C under N-2/H-2 (95:5) atmosphere. The NiP/C hybrid exhibits excellent OER/ORR activity. It can generate an OER current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at the overpotential of 0.26 V with a low Tafel slope of 43 mV dec(-1), and produce a limited ORR current density of 5.10 mA cm(-2) at 1600 rpm with a half-wave potential of 0.82 V via a 4-electron pathway. In addition, the OER/ORR catalytic currents remain considerable stable without significant loss for more than 25 h polarization. This work will open up a new avenue to design a bifunctional catalyst with a superior OER/ORR activity and stability, and this cost-efficient strategy will pave the way for the industrial application of the renewable energy technologies.

The electrocatalytic behavior of obtained electrodes has been evaluated in 30 wt% KOH aqueous solutions as a function of different temperatures (298. 323 and 343 K) and overvoltages (eta=200, 300,400 mV). The effect of Fe contamination during mechanical milling was also analyzed. The electrode performance was studied by cyclic voltammetry, ac-impedance and steady-state polarization techniques. Appreciable current values for oxygen evolution reactions (OER) were measured at Ni-Co-Mo-Fe electrodes produced by this technique. It was also found that the electrochemically formed Co and Fe oxides and/or hydroxides did not show an activity for OER as good as reported on hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Tafel plots of preoxidized at 1 cycle and prolonged cycled (50 cycles) for Co30Ni70, Co30Mo70, Ni30Mo70, Co10Ni20Mo70, Fe10Co30Ni60 and Co10Fe30Ni60 crystalline electrodes were very different, which might be related to changes in the surface enrichment of one or two of the alloy constituents. The Mo electrocatalytic effects seem to be more important on the OER at higher temperatures than those showed previously for HER. Molybdenum containing crystalline Co and Ni powders (Co10Ni20Mo70) showed the best catalytic behavior for the OER. (C) 2007 International Association for Hydrogen Energy. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Within the coal spontaneous combustion characteristic measurement system, a synchronous thermal analyzer (STA) and a Fourier transform infrared,' spectrometer (FTIR), the macro laws of gas and heat generation under DOC are analyzed, and the mechanism of the development of coal spontaneous combustion restricted by the lean oxygen environment is also revealed. The results show that the change of oxygen concentration (0C) does not affect the critical emperature value and gas index change trend, but the lean-orygenenvironment reduces the gas concentration and heat producti on rate very obviously. According to the temperature of the intersection, OC needs to be lowered to less than 5% when preventing spontaneous combustion of coal. The chain thermal reaction lags in the lean-oxygen environment, and the pyrolysis activity is significantly reduced. Meanwhile, the temperature points at T6 and T7 show significant differences. Furthermore, with increasing OC and temperature, the content of the aliphatic hydrocarbon presents an overall trend of first increasing, then decreasing, and continuously increasing after stage IV. It is concluded that *OH, aliphadc hydrocarbons, aromatic hydrocarbons, and carboxyl groups are the key groups for the coal spontaneous combustion evolution under 1)0C- To combine the spontaneous combustion reaction of coal in the DOC environment, the reaction path of the index gas in the macroscopic phenomenon and the reason for the concentration differences are revealed, the mechanism for exotherm varies caused by OC is clarified, and the microscopic inhibition affection on the chain reaction within the lean -oxygen envitrcoh couldnment explored.is also The results put forward the key groups evolution mechanism under the DOCfor coal 'oxidation,h provide the technical guidance for the fire prevention and control on coal mines.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			2470-1343			WOS:000663935000037	34151091

In this work, we report a vertically standing Fe3O4-FeSe/CoSe2 hierarchical structure material grown on carbon cloth as a highly active OER electrocatalyst. Benefiting from the rock-like Fe3O4 particles on the carbon cloth, the CoSe2 nano-arrays are more firmly affixed onto the carbon cloth. In addition, small amount of FeSe particles adsorbed on the CoSe2 arrays offer a synergistic advantage, in which CoSe2 achieved a small 279 mV over-potential at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) and a low Tafel slope of 68.78 mV dec(-1). By comparing the performance of Fe3O4-FeSe/CoSe2 with pure CoSe2 and Fe3O4-FeSe, it demonstrates to be the most efficient OER catalyst. Significantly, the hierarchical structural strategy of fixed Fe3O4 growth on carbon cloth arrays introduces a new concept to explore the design of high efficiency OER electrocatalysts.									13	2	0	0	0	0	13			0025-5408	1873-4227		WOS:000504521200029

However, there are some tough problems for the NRLOB development, which include poor cyclability and low charge-discharge current densities of the battery. These problems are chiefly relating to the electrochemical reactions on the surface of the porous oxygen positive electrode. The key issue should be to ensure reversible decomposition and formation of Li2O2 to proceed sustainedly at higher reaction rates.

Sulfur evolution from coal causes great harm from either the CLC operational or environmental perspective. In this research, a combined MnFe2O4 oxygen carrier (OC) was synthesized and its reaction with a typical Chinese high sulfur coal, Liuzhi (LZ) bituminous coal, was performed in a thermogravimetric analyzer (TGA)-Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectrometer. Evolution of sulfur species during reaction of LZ coal with MnFe2O4 OC was systematically investigated through experimental means combined with thermodynamic simulation. TGA-FTIR analysis of the LZ reaction with MnFe2O4 indicated MnFe2O4 exhibited the desired superior reactivity compared to the single reference oxides Mn3O4 or Fe2O3, and SO2 produced was mainly related to oxidization of H2S by MnFe2O4. Experimental analysis of the LZ coal reaction with MnFe2O4, including X-ray diffraction and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analysis, verified that the main reduced counterparts of MnFe2O4 were Fe3O4 and MnO, in good agreement with the related thermodynamic simulation. The obtained MnO was beneficial to stabilize the reduced MnFe2O4 and avoid serious sintering, although the oxygen in MnO was not fully utilized. Meanwhile, most sulfur present in LZ coal was converted to solid MnS during LZ reaction with MnFe2O4, which was further oxidized to MnSO4. Finally, the formation of both MnS and such manganese silicates as Mn2SiO4 and MnSiO3 should be addressed to ensure the full regeneration of the reduced MnFe2O4.									34	4	0	0	2	0	38			1001-0742	1878-7320		WOS:000335489400013	25079636

Herein, we propose a facile and cost-effective strategy to in situ grow N-doped carbon nanotubes with encapsulated FeCo alloy nanoparticles on carbon cloths (FeCo/N-CNTs@CC) as a self-supported air cathode for rechargeable ZABs. The bamboo-like FeCo/N-CNTs@CC catalyst with high nitrogen content (10.5 atom %) exhibits excellent electrocatalytic activities, including a half-wave potential of 0.816 V for ORR and an overpotential of 1.638 V for OER at 10 mA cm(-2) in alkaline medium. Impressively, the liquid-state ZAB based on the FeCo/N-CNTs@CC cathode demonstrates a remarkable power density of 132.0 mW cm(-2) and a stable cycling performance over 65 h. Furthermore, the flexible all-solid-state ZAB possesses outstanding performance retention under various bending conditions. The electrocatalyst presented in this work holds great potential as a self-supported air cathode for practical applications.									12	0	0	0	1	0	12			2168-0485			WOS:000636042800020

Chemically equivalent NiFe LDH material decorated with Pt NPs was prepared by co-precipitation for comparative studies. The synthesized catalysts were systematically screened for oxygen and hydrogen evolution reactions (OER and HER) in 1 M KOH. The intentional incorporation of Pt NPs on the LDH layers reduced the cell voltage and delivered high current densities with a lower loading of 0.205 mg cm(-2). The NiFe LDH crystalline sheets had shown significantly enhanced activity, good stability, lower overpotential (90 mV) at 10 mA cm(-2) and lower Tafel slope (12 mV dec(-1)) than the co-precipitated NiFe LDH in OER. Similarly, Pt NPs tethered NiFe LDH crystalline sheets showed better activity by having lower overpotential (27 mV) and Tafel slope (51 mV dec(-1)) than the co-precipitated NiFe LDH with Pt NPs. Moreover, the state-of-the-art catalysts viz., IrO2 and Pt/C 20 wt% of OER and HER failed in competing with Pt NPs tethered NiFe LDH crystalline sheets.									187	12	0	0	7	0	188			2211-2855	2211-3282		WOS:000408878200004

However, the practical applications of nanocrystals enclosed by HIFs still face many limitations in preparations of advanced electrocatalysts, including preparation strategy, limited life-time and stability. The development of advanced electrocatalysts enclosed with HIFs is crucial for solving these problems if the large-scale application of them is to be realized. Herein, we firstly detailedly demonstrate the identification methods of nanocrystals enclosed by HIFs, and then preparation strategies are elaborated in detail in this review. Current advanced nanocrystals enclosed by HIFs in electrocatalytic application are also summarized and we present representative achievements to further reveal the relationship of excellent electrocatalytic performance and nanocrystals with HIFs. Finally, we predict the remaining challenges and present our perspectives with regards of design strategies of improving electrocatalytic performance of Pt-based catalysts in the future.									12	4	0	0	0	0	14			1001-0521	1867-7185		WOS:000658140700001

Here, a series of Co-CoxO/N-doped Carbon (NC) is developed as bifunctional electrocatalysts via the pyrolysis of a simple physical mixture of cobalt-based metal-organic framework (MOF) and carbon black (CB). The obtained electrocatalysts exhibit considerably enhanced bifunctional activity as compared to the pure MOF derived counterpart. The essential roles of added CB in boosting the bifunctional activity are investigated. With the addition of CB, the surface concentrations of active pyridinic-N and graphitic-N for ORR and the surface CoIII/CoII ratios for OER are increased. Furthermore, the charge transfer efficiency and the electrochemically active surface areas (ECSAs) are also enhanced for the resulting electrocatalyst. The optimized Co-CoO-Co3O4/NC exhibits excellent bifunctional activity and durability, surpassing the commercial 20 wt% Pt/C (for ORR) and IrO2 (for OER). When applied in an air electrode, the corresponding Zn-air battery with Co-CoO-Co3O4/NC presents the better performance than that with 20 wt% Pt/C. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

An ideal OER electrocatalyst should possess rich active sites and optimal binding strength with oxygen-containing intermediates. Although numerous endeavors have been devoted to the modification and optimization of transition-metal-based OER electrocatalysts, they are still operated with sluggish kinetics. Herein, an ion-exchange approach is proposed to realize the structure engineering of amorphous P-CoS hollow nanomaterials by utilizing the ZIF-67 nanocubes as the precursors. The precise structure control of the amorphous hollow nanostructure contributes to the large exposure of surface active sites. Moreover, the introduction of phosphorus greatly modifies the electronic structure of CoS2, which is thus favorable for optimizing the binding energies of oxygenated species. Furthermore, the incorporation of phosphorus may also induce the formation of surface defects to regulate the local electronic structure and surface environment. As a result of this, such P-CoS hollow nanocatalysts display remarkable electrocatalytic activity and durability towards OER, which require an overpotential of 283 mV to afford a current density of 10 mA cm-2, outperforming commercial RuO2 catalyst.(c) 2022 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC.

While tremendous attention, involving both research and review topics, has been focused on pushing the limit of OER catalysts' activity, the long-term stability of OER catalysts, which may play an even more important role in large-scale electrolysis industrialization, has been much less emphasized. Until this point, few systematic strategies for developing OER catalysts with industrially relevant durability have been reported. In this review, critical mechanisms that could influence OER stability are summarized, including surface reconstruction, lattice oxygen evolution, and the dissolution-redeposition process of catalysts. Moreover, to bridge the gap between lab-scale OER tests and large-scale electrocatalysis applications, stability considerations in electrolyzer design for long-term operation are also discussed in detail. This review provides catalyst and reactor design principles for overcoming OER stability challenges and will focus more attention from the field on the great importance of OER stability as well as future large-scale electrocatalysis applications.									74	3	0	0	5	0	75			2542-4351			WOS:000675889700009

As a result, much effort has been devoted to developing efficient catalysts for OER. Herein, a composite anode is exploited by infiltrating PrCoO3-delta (PC) nanoparticles onto the surface of Pr0.5Ba0.5Co0.7Fe0.2Ti0.1O3-delta-Gd0.2Ce0.8O2-delta (PBCFT-GDC). Electrochemical measurements, in situ X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy spectra, and physicochemical characterizations indicate that the addition of PC with high electrical conductivity could expand the triple-phase boundaries and motivate the oxygen spillover at PC/PBCFT-GDC interfaces, which further boosts the OER activity and CO2 electrolysis performance. With the PC infiltration amount increasing from 0 to 9 wt %, the maximum current density of 1.43 A cm(-2) at 1.6 V and 800 ? is achieved for the SOEC with 6% PC/PBCFT-GDC anode, which is 43% higher than that of SOEC with bare PBCFT-GDC anode. This newly designed composite electrode material has a good application prospect as an active SOEC anode for CO2 electrolysis.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2574-0962			WOS:000864477500001

Here, we demonstrate a practical method to obtain FeNiOOH nanosheets on nickel foam (NF) as bifunctional electrocatalyst by growing a FeCo Prussian blue analog with further in situ oxidation under ambient conditions. The binder-free, self-standing FeNiOOH/NF electrode with hierarchical nanostructures requires low overpotentials of 260 mV and 240 mV at a current density of 50 mA cm(-2) for oxygen evolution reaction and hydrogen evolution reaction, respectively, in 1.0 M KOH solution. Therefore, an alkaline water electrolyzer constructed by bifunctional FeNiOOH/NF electrode as both anode and cathode delivers 50 mA cm(-2) under a cell voltage of 1.74 V with remarkable stability, which outperforms the IrO2-Pt/C-based electrolyzer. The excellent performance could be ascribed to the superior FeNiOOH intrinsic activity and the hierarchical structure. This work provides a cost-efficient surface engineering method to obtain binder-free, self-standing bifunctional electrocatalyst on commercial NF, which could be further extended to other energy and environment applications.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2296-2646			WOS:000795512600001	35572107

CoMoO4 with proper oxygen vacancy can be employed to construct a Li-air battery with a high capacity and stable cyclability. This is possible because CoMoO4 contains surface oxygen vacancies, which result in the unit of Co=Mo bond, that is important for electrocatalysts used in Li-air batteries. Both the experimental and theoretical results demonstrate that the surface oxygen vacancies containing CoMoO4 nanowires have a higher electrocatalytic activity. This shows that the highly efficient electrocatalysts used for Li-air batteries were designed to modify the redox properties of the mixed metal oxide in the catalytic active sites. This successful material design led to an improved strategy for high oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activities based on the fast formation and extinction of ORR products.

Herein we firstly synthesized a new type of bifunctional catalyst (NCNT/CoxMn1-xO) consisting of non-spinet cobalt-manganese oxide supported on N-doped carbon nanotubes through a simple non-surfactant assistant hydro thermal method. This hybrid catalyst exhibits much higher OER activity than that of IrO2, and comparable ORR activity to Pt/C with identical onset potential (0.96 V) in alkaline media. Furthermore, the NCNT/CoxMn1-xO catalyst was studied as a cathode in both primary and rechargeable zinc-air batteries demonstrating similar performance to commercial Pt/C or (Pt/C+IrO2), respectively. Primary zinc-air battery tests show a gravimetric energy density of 695 W h kg(zn)(-1), and the rechargeable battery exhibits a high round-trip efficiency evidenced by a low discharge-charge voltage gap (0.57 V) at a current density of 7 mA cm(-2).

Here, a facile activation-annealing route for upcycling biomass tar into graphene nanohybrids with developed porosity and enriched pyridinic nitrogen was reported, whilst the metal-free product revealed with superior catalytic activities to the benchmark Pt/C and RuO2 catalysts toward oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and evolution reaction (OER). By associating the dual functionalities with products' physiochemical properties, it was unveiled that those pyridinic-N and defects were accounted for the promoted oxygen reduction and evolution, respectively. Together with reinforced electric conductivity and hierarchical porosity and enlarged interface via ammonia annealing, the heterogeneously structured carbon catalyst finally endowed an assembled primary Zn-air battery with maximum energy density of 121 mW/cm(-2), in addition to robust stability against long-term running. This work highlights the great potential of biomass tar for advanced carbon materials, and therefore a novel strategy to address the tar-related challenges faced by gasification technologies.

The NiFe alloy nanotube array exhibited excellent bifunctional electrolytic activities, achieving low overpotentials of 100 mV for the hydrogen evolution reaction and 236 mV for the oxygen evolution reaction at 10 mA cm(-2), both in 1 M KOH at room temperature. For overall water splitting, the NiFe alloy nanotube array delivered 10 mA cm(-2) at an ultralow cell voltage of 1.58 V, among the top tier of the state-of-the-art bifunctional electrocatalysts. The NiFe alloy nanotube array also exhibited ultrastability at high current densities, experiencing only a minor chronoamperometric decay of 6.5% after a 24 h operation at 400 mA cm(-2). The success of the present binder-free nanotube array-based electrode can be attributed to the much enlarged reaction surface area, one-dimensionally guided charge transport and mass transfer offered by the nanotube structure, and improved product crystallinity provided by the pulse current electrodeposition. The nanotube array structure proves to be a promising new architecture design for electrocatalysts.									46	3	0	0	1	0	46			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000475532200030	31185711

The nitrogen doped carbon materials with low cost and long durability are potential catalysts to replace precious metal catalyst for oxygen electrochemistry; however, the unexposed active sites induced by the bulk dopant atoms are hardly accessible and consequently scarcely contribute to the catalytic property. In this study, carbon nanotubes (CNTs) are selected as the platform to demonstrate the potential of full exposure of active sites' at the surface. Novel N-doped carbon coaxial nanocables with the pristine CNTs as the core and the N-doped carbon layers as the shell are proposed. The accessible and efficient utilization of the integrated nitrogen atoms enriched on the surface, together with the undestroyed intact inner walls, render the electrocatalyst much enhanced electrocatalytic activity and high electrical conductivity of 3.3 S cm(-1), therefore, N-doped nanocables afford higher oxygen reduction current, approximate to 51 mV positively shift onset potential, low peroxide generation, as well as lower overpotential and higher current for oxygen evoluation reaction.									297	30	0	0	11	0	300			1616-301X	1616-3028		WOS:000343765600006

Hence, efficient electrocatalysts are in demand to reduce costs and energy consumption for oxygen and hydrogen evolution reaction (OER and HER) activity. Bismuth telluride (Bi2Te3)-based materials, as topological insulators (TIs), have been used to explore the fundamental properties of TIs in recent years, but investigation as functional materials for water splitting applications is still quite limited. In this work, electrocatalysts based on Bi2Te3 nanosheets have been fabricated, and the HER performance was investigated to further enhance OER electrocatalytic properties, with certain transition metals (Co, Ni, and Mo) selected to provide effective electrocatalytic sites. Therefore, the bifunctional catalyst Bi2Te3@CoNiMo was designed for synthesis by a solvothermal and chemical deposition route. The catalyst electrode, Bi2Te3@CoNiMo loaded on Ni foam, exhibits higher activity towards both the oxygen and the hydrogen evolution reactions than some traditional metallic catalysts in alkaline electrolytes. The difference in the HER and OER metrics (Delta E = 1.41 V) is comparable to the theoretical value (1.23 V), so that this reaction can be easily driven by a solar cell.									37	2	0	0	2	0	37			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000365011400030

Oxidized CNTs have widely been used to functionalize with metal or metal oxides since the defect sites act as anchoring for metal oxide binding. However, such defects on the tubes cause the decrease in electrical conductivity and stability, leading to lower catalyst performance. In the present study, at first, pristine multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWNTs) were wrapped by pyridine-based polybenzimidazole (PyPBI) to which uniform NixCo3-xO4 nanocrystals were homogeneously deposited by the solvothermal method without damaging the MWNTs, in which PyPBI acted as efficient anchoring sites for the deposition of spinel oxide nanocrystals with -5 nm size. The obtained catalyst (MWNT-PyPBI-NixCo3-xO4) outperformed most state-of-the-art non-precious metal-based bifunctional catalysts; namely, for OER, the potential at 10 mA cm(-2) and Tafel slope in 1 M KOH solution were 1.54 V vs. RHE and 42 mV dec(-1), respectively. For ORR, the onset and half-wave potentials are 0.918 V and 0.811 V vs. RHE, respectively. Moreover, the MWNT-PyPBI-NixCo3-xO4 demonstrates an excellent durability for both ORR and OER.									39	1	0	0	1	0	39			2045-2322			WOS:000397817900001	28358114

Although various engineering strategies, including size reduction and composition manipulation, have been adopted to modulate the innate electrochemical features of these layered materials, there remains a great deal of work to satisfy the specific requirements for practical applications. In this work, we set forth to provide an insight into the impact of niobium (Nb) doping on the structural features of titanium disulfide (TiS2). In addition, we examine the influence of Nb dopant on the inherent electrochemistry and charge transfer kinetics of TiS2 and its implication for the hydrogen evolution, oxygen reduction and oxygen evolution reaction (HER, ORR, and OER) processes. It has been found that introducing an appropriate amount of Nb atom (>10%) results in the formation of titanium trisulfide (TiS3) belt-like structures on the surface of TiS2 polygonal discs. Nb doping marginally changes the inherent electroactivity of TiS2 through introducing a small trace of reducible species. Furthermore, Nb-doped TiS2 materials show improved electron transfer kinetics when compared to pure TiS2, with the fastest k(obs)(0) of 5.58 x 10(-4) CM s(-1) toward [Fe(CN)(6)](3-/4-) redox probe recorded for Ti0.95Nb0.05S2. The same trend is also found in the HER activity of these materials whereby Nb-doped TiS2 materials exhibit better performance in the electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

However, the activity and stability of perovskite oxides still needs to be improved to efficiently utilize renewable and clean energy resources. Herein, we selectively introduced phosphorus (P) into SrCo0.8Fe0.2O3-delta (SCF) to form modified perovskite oxides, i. e., SrCo0.8Fe0.15P0.05O3-delta, SrCo0.75Fe0.2P0.05O3-delta and Sr(Co0.8Fe0.2)(0.95)P0.05O3-delta. An improved OER activity and stability compared to un-doped SCF was clearly observed. Meanwhile, the specific surface area, oxygen vacancy content and electronic conductivity increased due to the P doping. Moreover, a lower valence state of B-site cations induced by the high-valence P5+ was detected, which may contribute to the better activity and stability. Among them, the dual-site substitution to form Sr(Co0.8Fe0.2)(0.95)P0.05O3-delta stands out when evaluating the activity and stability in alkaline solution. The results suggest that the P doping could be an effective strategy to develop perovskite electrocatalysts with high electrocatalytic activity and stability.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			2199-692X			WOS:000460338200014

ACID-SOLUTIONS								JOURNAL OF THE ELECTROCHEMICAL SOCIETY				138	9			2549	2555		10.1149/1.2086015				SEP 1991	1991	The electron transfer process, which occurs during oxygen evolution at Pt electrodes from water molecules in the double layer, is analyzed. The process proceeds by electron tunneling through an insulating anodic Pt oxide film to the underlying Pt metal as oxygen is evolved. The rate equation for the reaction is based on a model of quantum tunneling through a barrier which is a composite of both the oxide film and the inner Helmholtz layer. For a barrier thickness of 10 angstrom, the probability of tunneling decreases by a factor of three as the electrode potential increases from 1.29 to 2.01 V vs. RHE. This decrease is small when compared to the observed, ca. 10(6), increase in current density for the same potential span. The current density is controlled primarily by the distribution of electron energy states of the reacting donor species which are water molecules in the inner Helmholtz plane. At a constant potential, the tunneling probability depends exponentially on the thickness of the potential barrier, and therefore the rate of the oxygen evolution reaction is strongly dependent on the Pt oxide film thickness.									54	0	0	0	3	0	54			0013-4651			WOS:A1991GF10600015

The electrochemical behaviour of the oxide film/1 M KOH interface was investigated by cyclic voltammetry and impedance techniques. The impedance measurements were carried out at different positive potentials, from the open circuit potential to a potential in the OER region and the electrical equivalent circuit, L (R(1)Q(1)) (R(2)Q(2)) (R(3)Q(3)) was used to fit the experimental results. At each potential, a good correlation between experimental and simulated data is found, thereby validating the proposed equivalent circuit model. The roughness factor value determined in the potential region where the charge transfer reaction is negligible is similar to that obtained by cyclic voltammetry, with a value of 70 +/- 2.									13	1	0	0	0	0	14			0021-891X	1572-8838		WOS:000260008700001

Here, we propose a promising strategy to achieve this goal by constructing van der Waals (vdW) heterostructures of two-dimensional (2D) materials. Using first-principles calculations, we predict two promising photocatalysts, MoSe2/SnSe2 and WSe2/SnSe2 heterostructures, with the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) taking place separately on the MoSe2 (WSe2) and SnSe2 layers. More excitingly, the Se-vacancy of the MoSe2 (WSe2) monolayer effectively lowers the HER overpotential, making the catalytic reactions occur spontaneously under the potentials solely provided by the photo-generated electrons and holes in pure water. The unique band alignment of these hetero-structured photocatalysts leads to high solar-to-hydrogen (STH) energy conversion efficiencies up to 10.5%, which is quite promising for commercial applications. This work opens up an avenue for the design of highly-efficient photocatalysts for full water splitting.									84	3	0	0	0	0	84			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000484297400033	31355831

In this work, a high and durable oxygen evolution reaction (OER) performance directly from bimetallic Zn100-xCox-ZIF samples is reported, without carrying out high-temperature calcination and/or carbonization. ZIFs can be reproducibly and readily synthesized in large scale at ambient conditions. The bimetallic ZIFs show a systematic and gradually improved OER activity with increasing cobalt concentration. A further increase in OER activity is evidenced in ZIF-67 polyhedrons with controlled particle size of <200 nm among samples of different sizes between 50 nm and 2 mu m. Building on this, a significantly enhanced, >50 %, OER activity is obtained with ZIF-67/carbon black, which shows a low overpotential of approximately 320 mV in 1.0 mKOH electrolyte. Such activity is comparable to or better than numerous MOF/ZIF-derived electrocatalysts. The optimized ZIF-67 sample also exhibits increased activity and durability over 24 h, which is attributed to an in situ developed active cobalt oxide/oxyhydroxide related nanophase.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			0947-6539	1521-3765		WOS:000573823200001	32846009

Herein, a porous bimetallic cobaltiron phosphide (CoFe-P) nanofoam is synthesized via a novel one-pot glucose-blowing followed by oxidization and then phosphidization process. The CoFe-P nanofoam presents a porous nanostructure which contributes to contact with electrolytes and release of generated gas during electrocatalytic reactions. As OER catalysts in alkaline, the bimetallic porous CoFe-P nanofoam exhibit a lower overpotential (258 mV@10 mA cm-2) as well as outstanding stability (70 h@100 mA cm-2), which surpasses the RuO2 and is comparable to many high-performance Co and Fe-based catalysts. It is demonstrated that the surface of CoFe-P undergo a reconstruction process and form new high active (CoxFe1-x)OOH. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that the elevated activity is caused by the bimetal Co and Fe optimizing the d-band center (Ed) energy levels and thus balancing the adsorption-desorption capacities for OER intermediates. This work through constructing porous bimetallic nanofoam offers a feasible strategy to facilitate the reaction activity and prolong the long-term stability of OER.(c) 2022 Published by Elsevier Inc.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0021-9797	1095-7103		WOS:000829370300014	35809440

Focusing on three different case studies, we summarise the bulk electronic and magnetic properties that initially serve to classify active perovskite catalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Ab-initio calculations centred on the orbital physics of the electrons in the d-shell provide a unique insight into the complex interplay between spin dependent interactions versus selectivity and OER reactivity that occurs in these transition-metal oxides. We analyse how the spin, orbital and lattice degrees of freedom establish rational design principles for OER. We observe that itinerant magnetism serves as an indicator for highly active oxygen electro-catalysts. Optimum active sites individually have a net magnetic moment, giving rise to exchange interactions which are collectively ferromagnetic, indicative of spin dependent transport. In particular, optimum active sites for OER need to possess sufficient empty orthogonal orbitals, oriented towards the ligands, to preserve an incoming spin aligned electron flow. Calculations from first principles open up the possibility of anticipating materials with improved electro-catalytic properties, based on orbital engineering.					3rd UK Catalysis Conference (UKCC)3rd UK Catalysis Conference (UKCC)	JAN 04-06, 2017JAN 04-06, 2017		Loughborough, ENGLANDLoughborough, ENGLAND	17	0	0	0	3	0	17			1022-5528	1572-9028		WOS:000429428100012		
J	Cheng, Feifei; Feng, Xiaolei; Chen, Xu; Lin, Weiguo; Rong, Junfeng; Yang, Wensheng								Synergistic action of Co-Fe layered double hydroxide electrocatalyst and multiple ions of sea salt for efficient seawater oxidation at near-neutral pH								ELECTROCHIMICA ACTA				251				336	343		10.1016/j.electacta.2017.08.098				OCT 10 2017	2017	Seawater splitting to produce hydrogen and oxygen is compelling but greatly challenging because of the impurity of seawater and the low activity of the existing catalysts. In the present work, Co-Fe layered double hydroxide (Co-Fe LDH) nanoparticles are synthesized by separate nucleation and aging steps, and investigated as electrocatalysts for seawater oxidation at near-neutral pH. Co-Fe LDH loaded onto a Timesh electrode shows high electrocatalytic activity (a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at 530 mV overpotential) and good selectivity for the oxygen evolution reaction at pH 8 in seawater. Furthermore, no additional buffered electrolytes are required, and the catalyst displays an acceptable stability for a diurnal cycle (8 h day(-1) ) under the given operating conditions. The possible mechanism for the enhanced performance is also explored. The synergistic action of Co-Fe LDH and multiple ions of sea salt is proposed. The combination of the electrochemical metrics and the facile and cost-effective synthesis make the Co-Fe LDH as a promising catalyst for a viable renewable energy storage technology.

However, the low efficiency of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) acts as a bottleneck in the water splitting process. Herein, interface engineering heterojunctions between ZIF-67 and layered double hydroxide (LDH) are designed to enhance the catalytic activity of the OER and the stability of Co-LDH. The interface is built by the oxygen (O) of Co-LDH and nitrogen (N) of the 2-methylimidazole ligand in ZIF-67, which modulates the local electronic structure of the catalytic active site. Density functional theory calculations demonstrate that the interfacial interaction can enhance the strength of the Co-O-out bond in Co-LDH, which makes it easier to break the H-O-out bond and results in a lower free energy change in the potential-determining step at the heterointerface in the OER process. Therefore, the Co-LDH@ZIF-67 exhibits superior OER activity with a low overpotential of 187 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) and long-term electrochemical stability for more than 50 h. This finding provides a design direction for improving the catalytic activity of OER.									74	2	0	0	2	0	74				2198-3844		WOS:000591882300001	33511013

Such changes include degradation, oxidation, and amorphization processes, each of which somehow affects the material's catalytic performance and durability. Some mechanisms involve the release of oxygen atoms from the oxide's lattice, the extent of which is determined by the structure of the catalyst. While the stability of hydrous Ir oxides suffers from the active participation of lattice oxygen atoms in the OER, rutile IrO2 is more stable and the lattice oxygen involvement is still under debate due to the insufficient sensitivity of commonly used online electrochemical mass spectrometry. Here, we revisit the case of rutile IrO2 at the atomic scale by a combination of isotope labeling and atom probe tomography and reveal the exchange of oxygen atoms between the oxide lattice and water. Our approach enables direct visualization of the electrochemically active volume of the catalysts and allows for the estimation of an oxygen exchange rate during the OER that is discussed in view of surface restructuring and subsequent degradation. Our work presents an unprecedented opportunity to quantitatively assess the exchange of surface species during an electrochemical reaction, relevant for the optimization of the long-term stability of catalytic systems.									45	0	0	0	4	0	45			1948-7185			WOS:000547468400013	32496784

The catalyst consists of a thin film of buserite-type layered manganese dioxide (MnO2) intercalated with Co2+ ions, resulting from electrodeposition of the layered MnO2 film with tetrabutylammonium (Bu4N+) ions on a carbon cloth, followed by ion-exchange of the initially incorporated Bu4N+ with Co2+ in solution. The electrode is capable to produce a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at an overpotential (eta) of 377 mV with a Tafel slope of 48 mV dec(-1), much superior to the layered MnO2 without Co2+.									12	0	0	0	1	0	12			1388-2481	1873-1902		WOS:000413740300006

Electrode activities and selectivities toward coal oxidation and oxygen evolution were determined by monitoring and analyzing anodic and cathodic gas products. The activities of platinum and various nickel surfaces were compared. Results indicate that coal reacts predominantly with OH radicals during the first 300 to 400 C/g of coal at an initial rate of 0.23 A/cm(2) in a slurry containing 14.3 g of coal per liter. After the 400 C/g level is achieved, the rate of coal oxidation begins to decrease, and oxygen evolution becomes appreciable. Coal oxidation continues to greater than 900 C/g coal. The 900 C/g reaction level corresponds to approximately one electron per six carbon atoms in the coal substrate and exceeds that expected for any type of surface passivation/functionalization. The rate-controlling steps in the coal reaction sequence appear to be OH radical formation on the electrode surface during the first 400 C/g of reaction and contacting of unreacted coal particles with the electrode thereafter. Coal oxidation competes with oxygen evolution, but the latter becomes significant only after the coal substrate has been depleted.									7	1	0	0	0	0	8			0013-4651			WOS:A1995QL58500026

In this study, the liquid phase ion exchange method is used to introduce atomic Ir into LaNiO3 perovskite oxide, which shows excellent catalytic performance in the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The catalyst, LaNi0.96 Ir0.04 O3 , with the optimal concentration of Ir, displays an overpotential of just 280mV at 10mAcm-2 . The introduced Ir enriches the surface electron density significantly, which not only improves site-to-site electron transfer between O and Ni sites but also allows stable adsorption of the intermediates. Theresults of cyclic voltammetry tests reveal the superior overpotential and remarkable efficiency of the OER process because of the strong interactions in Ni-O-Ir. Moreover, the Ir atom inhibits the participation of a lattice oxygen oxidation mechanism (LOM) in LaNiO3 that guarantees the stability of the catalyst in alkaline conditions. It is anticipated that this work will be instrumental for the preparation and study of a broad range of atomic metal-doped perovskite oxides for water splitting.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0				1613-6829		MEDLINE:36316242	36316242

To reach this objective, we propose an original approach focused on the anode compartment where the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) takes place. Different anode catalysts, anolytes and membranes were tested, and the components resulting in the most energy efficient and stable CO2 reduction reaction device were selected. A stainless-steel-based anode with significant OER activity and stability in a wide pH range was used to compare symmetric (neutral catholyte and anolyte) and asymmetric (neutral catholyte and alkaline anolyte) configurations. The gain in energy efficiency for carbon products of 6-8 % in the asymmetric configuration highlighted the advantages of a pH gradient. Although a Nafion membrane gave the highest energy efficiencies, the pH was unstable. Therefore, bipolar membranes that can maintain a pH gradient emerge as the best option for long-term electrolysis. This work paves the way for the development of highly energy efficient CO2-reduction devices with cathodes operating in low pH conditions.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			2196-0216			WOS:000680140000019

Herein, a series of ternary Fe-Mo-B materials with nanochain-like structure have been successfully fabricated by a green and feasible electroless deposition method. When the molar ratio of Mo/(Mo + Fe) precursor is tuned to 3/100, as-fabricated nanochain-like Fe-Mo-B shows remarkable OER performance with a low over-potential of only 253 mV at current density of 10 mA cm(-2) and a small Tafel slope of 63 mV dec(-1). In addition, it demonstrates a preeminent long-term electrochemical stability for continuous oxygen generation under alkaline condition. The enhanced OER performance benefits from the synergistic effects between Fe and Mo, bringing about the large electrocatalytic active surface area and fast electronic transfer rate. The work may pave a new path to reasonable design and construct metal-boride-based catalyst with excellent activity for electrocatalytic OER. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

The key to the success of this goal is the realization of robust earth-abundant materials and cost-effective reaction processes that can catalyze both hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER), with high efficiency and stability. In the past decade, one-dimensional (1D) nanomaterials and nanostructures have been substantially investigated for their potential in serving as these electrocatalysts for reducing overpotentials and increasing catalytic activity, due to their high electrochemically active surface area, fast charge transport, efficient mass transport of reactant species, and effective release of gas produced. In this review, we summarize the recent progress in developing new 1D nanomaterials as catalysts for HER, OER, as well as bifunctional electrocatalysts for both half reactions. Different categories of earth-abundant materials including metal-based and metal-free catalysts are introduced, with their representative results presented. The challenges and perspectives in this field are also discussed.									121	9	0	0	5	0	123			2198-3844			WOS:000397116000009	28331791

Through density functional theory investigations, we study the OER mechanism on CaMnO3, on the basis of a thermodynamic stability approach. Our results reveal that the formation of Mn vacancies caused by the solubility of Mn enhances lattice oxygen activity, which then reduces the energy of the adsorbate *OOH and therefore loosens the lower overpotential limit predicted from the "scaling relationship". This effect suggests that, by doping manganite oxides with soluble elements, we could enhance their OER catalytic activities due to the high surface lattice oxygen activity induced by surface metal ion vacancies.									17	0	0	0	1	0	17			2155-5435			WOS:000426804100066

They are well-known as active alkaline oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalysts,([1,5]) and are also often used as metal-ion battery anodes([6]) or as metal-air bifunctional electrodes.([7]) However, their electrochemical activities, particularly for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), across the whole 3d-element series remain largely unexplored. In this work, we perform a systematic screening of these catalysts for both OER and ORR using a surface edge-site model with exposed active sites for metal double hydroxides M(OH)(2), oxyhydroxides MOOH and oxides MO2. We establish OER and ORR activities and scaling relations of the whole series across +2, +3 and +4 oxidation states, and successfully reproduce the experimental activities of a few pure layered (oxy)(hydro)oxides. We predict CoOOH/CoO2 and NiOOH/NiO2 as active and stable OER catalysts. We also predict Fe(OH)(2)/FeOOH, Mn(OH)(2)/MnOOH and Co(OH)(2) as active and stable ORR catalysts. This makes Co-(oxy)(hydro)oxides only bifunctional catalyst in this series. Using linear regression, our results indicate that trends across the 3d-series can be obtained from only a few bulk, surface and atomic type descriptors. Particularly, we identify that the number of outer d-electrons at the surface-active site as the most important descriptor of activity.									24	2	0	0	0	0	25			1867-3880	1867-3899		WOS:000480290100012

Herein, by a self-sacrificial template method, Fe-Co-P multi-heterostructure arrays consisting of CoP, Co2P and FeP are built for water splitting. Such multi-heterostructures adjust the local electronic structure and then improve adsorption of reaction intermediates on active sites, which is further proved through density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Thus, without noble metals, the as-prepared Fe-Co-P multi-heterostructure catalyst exhibits very high catalytic performance, which only needs 227 and 87 mV to reach a current density of 20 and 10 mA cm(-2) for the OER and HER, respectively, better than most of the related catalysts reported so far. Moreover, when used in alkaline electrolyzers, it delivers a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at a cell voltage of 1.55 V, superior to commercial Pt-group electrodes (1.59 V). Our work offers a novel approach to rationally design catalysts toward water splitting.									21	0	0	0	1	0	21			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000711113900001

Importantly, it is found that there aremore defects in FeCo-LDH/PANI compared to that of FeCo-LDHpossibly attributed to the local etching of H+ released from the polymerization of aniline.

Immense effort has been made to optimize MoS2 catalysts with more active sites for the sake of satisfying HER performance. In this work, the MoS2 is modulated by electrochemical anodic activation at positive potentials in acidic media to fast intercalate oxygen into MoS2 in 200 s, leading to the dramatic enhancement for HER activity. Cyclic voltammetry, high-resolution transmission electron microscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, in situ atomic force microscope and operando Raman spectroscopy are applied to explore the oxygen doping process of MoS2 in 0.5MH(2)SO(4) electrolyte. In brief, the optimal oxygen doped MoS2 catalyst exhibits an onset potential of as low as -87 mV vs. RHE at 1 mA cm(-2) accompanied by excellent stability, which is reduced about 50 mV compared to that before electrochemical anodic activation of MoS2 (135 mV). This work will create a simple and universal method to improve the activities of catalysts by electrochemical anodic activation process, which was successfully applied to MoS2, MoSe2 and MoP.									68	3	0	0	4	0	68			2211-2855	2211-3282		WOS:000474636100039

The critical challenge in this area is to explore alternative precious-metal-free catalysts to promote the OER process. Transition metal-based compounds have attracted much attention in electrochemical water splitting because of their unique chemical and physical properties, as well as low cost. In this review, we summarize the recent research status and progress of spinel, perovskite and layered double hydroxides as electrocatalysts for OER, which have been extensively studied in recent years. The researcher strategies developed to promote electrocatalytic activities and stability are described, along with the electrochemical properties of theses developed catalysts. Based on related references, we observed that there are generally two strategies to improve OER catalyst activities:(1)introduce more active sites and expose them to the catalyst surface and(2)optimize the conductivity of OER catalysts. These requirements can be met to some extent by the controlling size, morphology, intrinsic and lattice defects, oxygen vacancies, phase and composition of OER catalysts, and by the incorporation of conducting materials in composites. Finally, the future development of OER electrocatalysts is briefly discussed.			由于动力学缓慢,在能源转换和储存过程中,特别是在电解水过程,氧析出反应(OER)是一个关键的限制性反应。目前该领域所面临的主要挑战是探索不含贵金属的催化剂,以促进OER反应过程。由于独特的化学、物理特性和低廉的使用成本,过渡金属基化合物在水的电化学分解过程中的应用得到了广泛关注。本文综述了尖晶石、钙钛矿和层状双金属氢氧化物(LDH)三种过渡金属化合物作为OER电催化剂的最新研究现状和进展,重点介绍了提高OER催化活性和催化剂稳定性的策略以及相应催化剂的催化性能和效果。综合当前文献的研究结果可以发现,OER催化活性的提高主要有两种措施:一是在催化剂中引入更多的催化活性位点,并且保证这些活性位点尽可能暴露在催化剂的表面;二是优化催化剂的导电性能。通过控制尺寸、形态、晶格缺陷、氧空位、相态及化学组成,或者与导电材料相复合,可以在一定程度上满足上述两种要求。最后,对OER电催化剂的未来发展方向进行简要讨论。						0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2095-4239			CSCD:7147748

The as prepared Ag10Si4O13 was characterized by XRD, SEM, TEM, UV-vis and XPS. The photocatalytic capability of Ag10Si4O13 was estimated through photo-degradation of MB solution and photocatalytic oxygen generation under visible light irradiation. TOC changes of MB solution before and after photocatalytic experiment identified the mineralization of MB molecules. During photocatalytic oxygen generation reaction, Co3O4 was used as cocatalyst to boost oxygen evolution. Compared with pure Ag10Si4O13, 4% Co3O4/Ag10Si4O13 showed higher efficiency in oxygen evolution. Radical-trapping experiments and results show that holes generated by Ag10Si4O13 are main active ingredient-oxidizing organic pollution under light irradiation. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

J	Vincent, Immanuel; Lee, Eun-Chong; Kim, Hyung-Man					Vincent, Immanuel/0000-0002-0409-9605			Highly Active Ni-Fe Based Oxide Oxygen Evolution Reaction Electrocatalysts for Alkaline Anion Exchange Membrane Electrolyser								CATALYSTS				12	5					476	10.3390/catal12050476				MAY 2022	2022	Oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrocatalysts are pivotal for sustainable hydrogen production through anion exchange membrane electrolysis. Cost-effective transition metals such as nickel and iron-based oxides (Ni-Fe-O-x) have been recognized as viable catalysts for the oxygen evolution process in alkaline media. In this work, we study the electrochemical characterization and stability of the Ni-Fe-O-x to find the suitability for AEM electrolysis. The results indicate that Ni-Fe-O-x has 5 times higher activity than pure Ni. The Ni-Fe-O-x electrodes exhibit an exceptionally high catalytic activity of 22 mA cm(-2) at 1.55 V vs. RHE, and a Tafel value as low as 97 dec(-1), for OER to occur. These findings imply that OER occurs at similar places along the Ni-Fe-O-x interface and that the Ni-Fe2O3 contact plays a significant role as the OER active site. Furthermore, it is also worth noting that the presence of metallic Ni allows for fast electron transit within the interface, which is necessary for successful electrocatalysis. Aside from the excellent OER performance, the exfoliated Ni-Fe-O-x demonstrated great stability with almost constant potential after 10 h of electrolysis at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2). This work confirms Ni-Fe-O-x is a promising, highly efficient and cost-effective OER catalyst for AEM electrolysis.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0				2073-4344		WOS:000801245100001

The OER activities of BSCF are gradually enhanced by prolonging the duration of electrochemical operation at OER potentials, but the underlying cause is not fully understood. In this study, we investigated the role of chemical operation, equivalent to immersion in alkaline solution, in the time-course of OER enhancement of BSCF. Interestingly, the time-course OER enhancement of BSCF was promoted not only by electrochemical operation, which corresponds to potential cycling in the OER region, but also by chemical operation. In situ Raman measurements clarified that chemical operation had a lower rate of surface amorphization than electrochemical operation. On the other hand, the leaching behavior of A-site cations was comparable between chemical and electrochemical operations. Since the OER activity of BSCF was stabilized by saturating the electrolyte with Ba2+, "chemical" A-site leaching was key to inducing the time-course OER enhancement on perovskite electrocatalysts. Based on these results, we provide a fundamental understanding of the role of chemical operation in the OER properties of perovskites.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0013-4651	1945-7111		WOS:000742456600001

In untreated alkaline medium, amorphous cobalt (Co)-iron (Fe) hydroxide showed oxygen-evolution advantages over the typical reference catalyst (RuO2). When tested with a three-electrode system in 1 M KOH, the obtained amorphous PVP/CoFe1.3 nanofibers possessed remarkable catalytic activity and stability for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) with a low overpotential of 0.267 V at 100 mA cm(-2) and a low Tafel slope of 47.43 mV dec(-1). The amorphous CoFe microfibers were synthesized by electrospinning, and stable CoFe hydroxides can be further formed in the alkaline environment. The synergistic effect between two different amorphous CoFe-based hydroxides contributed to excellent electrocatalytic activity. Therefore, the design of amorphous CoFe hydroxide enabled the development of a high-efficiency OER catalyst and opens possibilities for the large-scale and environmentally friendly production of water splitting.									54	4	0	0	4	0	54			2052-1553			WOS:000461092500005

Nevertheless, the practical application of LOBs with a sensible cathode material has largely been blocked due to their low-activity catalysts and inefficient product evolution. Combining carbon and metal oxide is one of the most effective strategies to realize the high capacity and lower overpotential for boosting the Li-O-2 battery performance. Herein, cobalt oxide (Co3O4) nanoparticle-dotted hierarchical-assembled carbon nanosheet frameworks (Co3O4-HCNFs) were fabricated using a facile two-step carbonization-calcined route and applied as high-efficiency electrochemical catalysts for Li-O-2 batteries. Co3O4 has been proved to be effective for the full composition/decomposition of generated Li2O2 thin films during the oxygen reduction reaction process (ORR) and the oxygen evolution reaction process (OER). Furthermore, the cobalt oxide nanoparticle-dotted hierarchical-assembled carbon nanosheet frameworks satisfy the relevant requirements including controlled morphology and efficient volume change accommodation, which delivered a high-performance with a large specific capacity of 14 949 mA h g(-1) and superior cycling stability with 180 cycles. This study designs a smart strategy with high-performance Co3O4 cathodes for Li-O-2 batteries and the composition/decomposition mechanisms of Li2O2 films, showing a favorable method for recomposing the future design of Co3O4-based advanced energy materials.									41	0	0	0	3	0	41			2052-1553			WOS:000753569500001

Enhanced bifunctional catalytic activity of surface-modified vanadyl ethylene glycolate for oxygen reduction and evolution reactions								MATERIALS CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS				289						126506	10.1016/j.matchemphys.2022.126506				SEP 15 2022	2022	This article reports the first instance of using vanadyl ethylene glycolate as an efficient bifunctional electro-catalyst for oxygen reduction (ORR) and evolution reactions (OER). A simple solvothermal method was employed for the synthesis of VEG and the surface-modified VEG with graphene oxide (VEG-GO). The VEG-GO catalyzes the reduction of oxygen to water via a four-electron pathway with an E1/2 value of 0.62 V and it possesses a low Tafel slope value (62 mV dec (-1)) compared to Pt/C (85 mV dec -1), suggesting efficient oxygen kinetic activity. It also catalyzes O2 evolution with an overpotential of 300 mV at 10 mA cm(-2), and the chronoamperometry measurements revealed excellent stability for this material. With a potential difference of 0.91 V between ORR and OER, the VEG-GO is better than pristine VEG and many oxygen electrocatalysts reported in the literature. This work provides an important insight into using organic-inorganic hybrid materials as bifunctional electrocatalysts for the ORR and OER.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0254-0584	1879-3312		WOS:000839349900001

Herein, we present a spinel NiCo2O4 nanowire arrays (NWAs), synthesized by a simple solution route, as an inexpensive, efficient anode electrocatalyst for water electrolysis. The as-prepared NiCo2O4 NWAs contains Ni2+/Ni3+ which replace Co in octahedral sites of the spinel CO3O4, exhibiting higher catalytic activity than that of Co3O4 and NiO. The enhanced catalytic activity of NiCo2O4 NWAs is correlated with a large surface area, one-dimensional (10) architecture, high conductivity and synergistic behavior of Ni/Co bifunctional catalyst. Besides, oxygen vacancies, which favor efficient electrons transport, supply more active sites, and assist in the adsorption of OH-, can be conducive to make high utilization of catalytic materials in the OER. Moreover, the magnetic properties of NiCo2O4 NWAs are also investigated in detail. The results indicate that NiCo2O4 NWAs could be a promising economical and environmentally benign bifunctional electrocatalyst for water splitting and other applications. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Herein, an exceptionally efficient trifunctional metal-nitrogen-carbon (M-N-C) catalyst electrode, composed of a hierarchical carbon matrix embedding isolated nickel atoms with nickel-iron (NiFe) clusters, is presented. 1D microfibers and nanotubes grow sequentially from 2D nanosheets as sacrificial templates via two stages of solution- and solid-phase reactions to form a 1D hierarchy. Exceptionally efficient bifunctional activity with an overpotential of only 13 mV at 10 mA cm-2 toward hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and an overpotential of 210 mV at 30 mA cm-2 toward oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is obtained, surpassing each monofunctional activity ever reported. More importantly, an overpotential of only 126 and 326 mV is required to drive 500 mA cm-2 toward the HER and OER, respectively. For the first time, industrial-scale water splitting with two bifunctional catalyst electrodes with a current density of 500 mA cm-2 at a potential of 1.71 V is demonstrated. Lastly, trifunctional catalytic activity including oxygen reduction reaction is also proven with a half-wave potential at 0.848 V.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1613-6810			INSPEC:21032559

Metal telluride is a type of low-cost OER catalyst with promising activity. To improve the OER performance of metal telluride, we propose herein the design of composite metal telluride OER catalyst that fully utilizes the advantages of each component in the composite. The developed Ni3Te2-CoTe/CC composite electrocatalyst has a high OER performance than its Ni3Te2 and CoTe counterpart. The improved OER performance of the composite Ni3Te2-CoTe electrocatalyst can be on one hand ascribed to the high density of state near Fermi level in Ni3Te2 phase, as suggested by DFT analysis. On the other hand, the introduction of CoTe phase in the composite effectively enlarges the electrochemical surface area of the catalyst, thus improving the activity of the composite.									18	1	0	0	1	0	18			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000472709100055

Functionally, this linkage can be attributed to oxygen ranking high in both abundance and electronegativity amongst the stable elements of the universe. That is, reduction of oxygen provides for close to the largest possible transfer of energy for each electron transfer reaction. This suggests the general hypothesis that the steep thermodynamic gradient of an oxygen environment was permissive for the development of multicellular complexity. A corollary of this hypothesis is that aerobic metabolism underwrites complex biological function mechanistically at all levels of organization. The strong contemporary functional association of aerobic metabolism with both physical capacity and health is presumably a product of the integral role of oxygen in our evolutionary history. Here we provide arguments from thermodynamics, evolution, metabolic network analysis, clinical observations and animal models that are in accord with the centrality of oxygen in biology.									70	5	0	0	54	1	74			0022-3751	1469-7793		WOS:000252678700013	17947307

Low-cost and earth-abundant FeNi (oxy)-hydroxides have the potential to be the best-performing OER catalyst families. Here, we report on Fe-rich FeNi-layered double-hydroxide (LDH) nanoflakes (Fe/Ni = 1:1.5 mol/mol) with a sheet dimension of 10-20 nm and bearing an increased number of OER-active sites. An aqueous dispersion solution of FeNi Prussian blue analog nanoparticles (PBA NPs) is drop-cast on CP, and their metal compositions and microgram-scale mass-loading amounts are systematically controlled. The PBA NPs are transformed into LDH nanoflakes in an alkaline aqueous solution. To the best of our knowledge, compared to the previously reported catalysts, the LDH nanoflakes intrinsically show potential comparable to that of catalysts with the highest activity, based on the lowest Tafel slope (15.1 mV dec(-1)) and the highest values of turnover frequency (1.58 s(-1)) and mass activity (10 600 A g(-1)) at a low overpotential of 300 mV. Drop-coated Mn2+ ions significantly enhance the intrinsic ORR activity of CP. The independently optimized OER and ORR catalysts are united on the same sheet of CP as a bifunctional pair.									6	0	0	0	1	0	6			2574-0962			WOS:000576676900097

It is affected by many factors, and its mechanism is still not completely understood. A proton exchange membrane electrolyzer cell (PEMEC) with optical access to the surface of anode catalyst layer (CL) coupled with a distinguished high-speed and micro-scale visualization system (HMVS) was developed to in situ investigate OERs. It was revealed in real time that OERs only occur on the anode CL adjacent to liquid/gas diffusion layer (LGDL). The CL electrical conductivity plays a crucial role in OERs on CLs. The large in-plane electrical resistance of CLs becomes a threshold of OERs over the entire CL, and causes a lot of catalyst waste in the middle of LGDL pores. Moreover, the oxygen bubble nucleation, growth, and detachment and the effect of current density on those processes were also characterized. This study proposes a new approach for better understanding the mechanisms of OERs and optimizing the design and fabrication of membrane electrode assemblies.									54	2	0	0	1	0	54			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000410597200015

Four new dinuclear cobalt complexes featuring this ligand have been prepared and thoroughly characterized both in the solid state (X-ray diffraction) and in solution (1D and 2D NMR spectroscopy, ESI-MS, and electrochemical techniques). The flexible but stable coordination environment provided by the ligand scaffold when coordinating Co in different oxidation states is shown to play a crucial role in the performance of the set of complexes when tested as catalysts for the photochemical hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and chemical oxygen reduction reaction (ORR).									28	2	0	0	1	0	28			0947-6539	1521-3765		WOS:000368897600043	26608517

In this work, one-dimensional (1D) cable-like multiwall carbon nanotube/S, N co-doped carbon nanodot (MWCNT@S-N-C) hybrids were synthesized by annealing multiwall carbon nanotubes/polythiophene (MWCNT@Pth) in the NH3 atmosphere. The as-prepared catalysts exhibit an outstanding oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activity (an unusual high limiting current density of 7.62 mA cm(-2)), strong immunity towards methanol crossover and long-term stability. Moreover, the obtained catalysts also display a higher activity toward oxygen evolution reaction (OER) compared to the state-of-the-art IrO2 catalyst, demonstrating excellent overall bi-catalytic performance. This superior electrocatalytic activity arises from synergistic chemical coupling effects between S and N, excellent reactant transport provided by mesoporous structures and a high charge transfer rate driven by 1D MWCNTs, thereby generating a high performance bi-functional electrocatalyst for both ORR and OER. This is the first time that S, N co-doped carbon materials have been investigated as effective bifunctional catalysts, which not only provides a further insight into the electrocatalytic mechanism, but also provides a new approach for the design and fabrication of metal-free bi-functional oxygen catalysts with low cost and high efficiencies in electrochemical energy conversion.									31	1	0	0	2	0	31			1144-0546	1369-9261		WOS:000358512200055

Here a cation deficiency-promoted phase separation strategy to design perovskite-based composites with significantly enhanced water oxidation kinetics compared to single-phase counterparts is reported. These composites, self-assembled from perovskite precursors, comprise strongly interacting perovskite and related phases, whose structure, composition, and concentration can be accurately controlled by tailoring the stoichiometry of the precursors. The composite catalyst with optimized phase composition and concentration outperforms known perovskite oxide systems and state-of-the-art catalysts by 1-3 orders of magnitude. It is further demonstrated that the strong interfacial interaction of the composite catalysts plays a key role in promoting oxygen ionic transport to boost the lattice-oxygen participated water oxidation. These results suggest a simple and viable approach to developing high-performance, perovskite-based composite catalysts for electrochemical energy conversion.									47	1	0	0	2	0	46			1613-6810	1613-6829		WOS:000662128800001	34137160

The oxygen evolution reaction (OER), a half reaction of water electrolysis is hampered by its slow kinetics. Developing high performance electrocatalysts for enhancing OER kinetics is the main bottleneck of this technology. In this study, we synthesize a ternary cobalt iron disulfide as a pre-catalyst for OER. After the activation step, the synthesized catalyst transformed to cobalt-iron amorphous oxide with oxygen defects as an efficient catalyst for OER. At its optimized Co/Fe ratio, equal to 3:1, the activated catalyst requires only 267 mV overpotential to reach the current density of 10 mA cm(-2), while Tafel slope is 34 mV dec(-1). Density functional theory calculation reveals that the active phase of the OER process is a thin layer of oxide that forms during the voltammetry activating process and the reduced energy barrier of rate determining step contributes to the excellent OER performance of cobalt-iron amorphous oxide.									13	1	0	0	0	0	13			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000608515300009

Single-atom catalysts (SACs) are recently emerging as a new frontier in catalysis science. With maximum atom-utilization efficiency and unique properties, SACs exhibit great potential for enabling reasonable use of metal resources and achieving atomic economy. However, fabricating SACs and maintaining the metal centers as atomically dispersed sites under synthesis and catalysis conditions are challenging. Here, we highlight and summarize recent advances in wet-chemistry synthetic methods for SACs with special emphasis on how to achieve the stabilization of single metal atoms against migration and agglomeration. Moreover, we summarize and discuss the electrochemical applications of SACs with a focus on the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), and CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR). At last, the current issues and the prospects for the development of this field are discussed.									1063	89	0	0	70	1	1074			2542-4351			WOS:000439698900009

Detailed knowledge of the effect and cycle of oxygen species under reaction is typically missing, and this study points at the behavior of oxygen species over MnOx/SBA-15 for toluene oxidation for the first time, using in situ mass spectrum techniques with the isotope O-18(2). It is found that the Langmuir-Hinshelwood and Mars-van Krevelen mechanism coexist in toluene oxidation over MnOx/SBA-15 catalyst. In this study, surface and bulk lattice oxygen are shown to be vital active oxygen species in the whole reaction. The consumed oxygen species are replenished with gaseous oxygen, and the process follows the Mars-van Krevelen mechanism, as confirmed by detection of isotopic products. The adsorbed oxygen species with good mobility is also found to start up and participate in the reaction at lower temperatures, which follows the Langmuir-Hinshelwood reaction mechanism. The addition of Ag increases the amount of surface lattice oxygen species and improves the transformation rate and the migration of lattice oxygen, which effectively facilitates the low-temperature activity of toluene oxidation.

A novel bottom-up one-pot solvothermal strategy followed by low-temperature phosphorization was developed to prepare 3D hierarchical flower-like materials composed of ultrathin cobalt based bimetallic phosphide nanosheets (CoM-P-3DHFLMs) as cost-effective OER electrocatalysts, which are highly efficient and durable. Due to their unique structural and compositional advantages, the CoM-P-3DHFLMs not only achieve satisfying electrocatalytic efficiencies (eta@10 mA cm(-2) = 292 mV, 318 mV, and 307 mV for CoNi-, CoMn-, and CoCu-P-3DHFLM, respectively) comparable to IrO2 and RuO2 counterparts, but also exhibit long-term stability with subtle decrement after 10 h. The advantages of high efficiency, good stability, and free of noble metal make the as-prepared 3DHFLMs promising candidates for OER.									80	5	0	0	5	0	81			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000464487500016

However, MOF crystal powders are usually difficult to be directly applied into specific devices because of their brittleness, insolubility and low compatibility. Therefore, to expand versatile MOF membranes with robustness and operational flexibility is urgent to satisfy practical applications. Although numerous reports have reviewed the synthesis and applications of MOF membranes, relatively few reports the electrocatalytic properties based on MOF membranes. Herein, this mini-review provides an overview of preparation of MOF membranes, including directed synthesis, secondary growth and electrochemical deposition method. Meanwhile, fabrication of ultrathin 2D MOF nanosheets those can be also defined as a kind of nanoscale MOF membranes is also mentioned.

Yet, the application of metal-air batteries in practice is still not mature, which is also related to the bifunctional oxygen electrocatalysis at the cathode, comprising the oxygen reduction (ORR) and oxygen evolution (OER) reactions during discharge and charge of the battery, respectively. Experimentally, the performance of electrocatalysts in the OER and ORR is described by bifunctional index (BI), but, so far, there is no direct approach to capture the BI on the atomic scale. Herein, we present a method to ascertain the BI from ab initio theory, thereby combining a data-driven methodology with thermodynamic considerations and microkinetic modeling as a function of the applied overpotential. Our approach allows deriving the BI from simple adsorption free energies, which are easily accessible to electronic structure theory in the density functional theory (DFT) approximation. We outline how our methodology may steer the design of efficient bifunctional catalysts on the atomic scale.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			2196-0216			WOS:000760389500007

Here, a novel heterointerface of Co@LCO nanofibers (Co@LCO-NFs) is developedviaan elegantin situexsolution approach to promote bifunctionality. Thisin situexsolution promises improved electrical conductivity, rich oxygen vacancies, and in particular a modulated electronic structure, thereby demonstrating a substantially enhanced bifunctional activity. Density functional theory calculations further reveal that the synergistic coupling of LCO and Co results in strengthened covalency of Co-O and facilitated OER/ORR kinetics. As a result, an assembled Zn-air battery using the Co@LCO-NFs electrode delivers high peak power density with competitive cycling stability, favorably outperforming the benchmark Pt/C-IrO(2)based batteries. This protocol provides new insights into designing heterostructured bifunctional catalysts for related energy conversion and storage devices.									15	1	0	0	0	0	15			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000575366700018

Here we construct ultrathin and highly curved 2D FeCoNi trimetal-organic framework nanosheets (FeCoNi-MOFs) with only approximately 1.5 nm thickness and abundant oxygen vacancies. The formed defect-rich FeCoNi-MOFs display outstanding OER performance with a much smaller overpotential of 254 mV at 10 mA cm-2 and remarkable stability for over 100 h in alkaline solutions. This is the highest OER activity level attained for directMOF catalysts. Theoretical analysis of FeCoNi MOFs with rich oxygen vacancies further suggests that the increased Fermi level with multiple heterointerfaces and the addition of oxygen vacancies co-facilitate the preoxidation of low-valence metals and the reconstruction/deprotonation of intermediate metal-OOH, thus enhancing electron transport efficiency.									19	0	0	0	0	0	19			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000706861200001

Herein, this work puts forward a novel ternary NiCoRu-layered double hydroxide (NiCoRu-LDH) synthesized via a facile one-step chloride (Cl-) corrosion for Ni foam (NF) in the situ process as an excellent electrocatalyst toward OER. The introduction of Ru cations prominently altered the electronic properties of NiCo-LDH, exposing more surface active sites, and optimizing the intermediates of adsorption oxygen (OOH*) for water oxidation. As expected, the obtained trimetallic NiCoRu-LDH/NF electrode revealed a fairly low overpotential toward OER (270 mV at 100 mA.cm(-2)) with a Tafel slope of 40 mV.dec(-1) and prolonged stability (55 h at 100 mA.cm(-2)) in alkaline solution, outperforming most of the hydroxide-based electrocatalysts currently reported.

CoFe2O4 has been reported as a promising oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrocatalyst. However, CoFe2O4 showed poor conductivity and sluggish electrocatalysis in the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). In this work a new hybrid catalyst was synthesized based on single-walled carbon nanotube (SWNT)-wrapped CoFe2O4 nanorods. The synergistic effect between CoFe2O4 nanorods and SWNTs can not only increase the oxygen vacancies and optimize the electronic structure of the composite but also facilitate the adsorption and stabilization of hydroxyl, which could significantly improve both the OER and HER performances. Besides, the addition of SWNTs would reduce the aggregating and tubes bundling in the composites and further improve the stability of the hybrid. All of the excellent performances indicated CoFe2O4/SWNTs as a promising bifunctional electrocatalyst for OER and HER, as well as overall water splitting.									38	2	0	0	2	0	39			2574-0962			WOS:000459948900013

We developed a photoactive bifunctional air-electrocatalyst comprising n-type g-C3N4 and p-type copper-doped ZIF67 (CuZIF-67) composite. g-C3N4/CuZIF-67 exhibits wide-range solar spectrum absorption and enhanced electron-hole pairs separation efficiency owing to synergistic effects of a suitable bandgap width, staggered p-n heterojunction band gap structure, and built-in electric field at its p-n heterojunction, leading to higher oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activities compared with single p-and n-type catalysts. It has photo-enhanced charge/discharge abilities, has a voltage gap of 0.81 V under 1-sun-illumination, and maintains stable cycling with 60% round-trip efficiency under illumination over 1000 cycles for 336 h at 2 mA cm(-2). In conclusion, staggered p-n heterojunction and pyrrolic nitrogen-rich groups are important for efficient and durable photo-enhanced Zn air batteries.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000783803100004

In a typical procedure, graphite foils were used to obtain bulk quantities of SDGN catalysts in the presence of thiosulfate as a sulfur source. Highly stable colloidal dispersions of SDGNs were obtained by applying a voltage of 15 V at an optimized Na2S2O3:H2SO4 molar ratio of 5 : 1 (denoted SDGN(5)). Physicochemical characterizations by Raman spectroscopy, transmission electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy confirmed the existence of sulfur and its electronic/structural properties in graphene nanosheets. In alkaline media, SDGN(5)-modified electrodes were comparable or superior to pristine graphene and a benchmark commercial platinum-based electrodes in terms of stability, methanol tolerance, n values, and onset potential for ORR and OER. The specific capacitance (149.9 F g(-1)) of SDGN(5) supported its excellent ORR/OER performance and enhanced surface area. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Herein, hollow oxygen deficiency-enriched NiFe2O4 is synthesized by pyrolytic FeNi bimetallic MOF. The defects of rGO during carbonization can act as nucleation sites for FeNi particles. After nucleation and N doping, the FeNi particles were served as catalysts for the deposition of dissolved carbon in the defects of the N/rGO. These deposited carbon, like a bridge, connect N/rGO and hollow oxygen deficiency-enriched NiFe2O4 together, which giving full play to the advantages of N/rGO in fast electron transfer, thereby improving its catalytic activity. The resultant NiFe2O4 @N/rGO-800 exhibits a low overpotential of 252 mV at 20 mA cm(2) for OER and 157 mV at 10 mA cm(2) for HER in 1 M KOH, respectively. When used as bifunctional electrodes for overall water splitting, it also shows low cell voltage of 1.60 V and 1.67 V at 10 and 20 mA cm(2), respectively.

Variation of the Fe/Co ratio resulted in a pronounced trend in the bifunctional ORR/OER activity. Controlled synthesis and in-depth characterization enabled the identification of an optimal Fe/Co composition, which afforded a low OER/OER reversible overvoltage of only 0.831V, taking the OER at 10 mA cm(-2) and the ORR at -1 mA cm(-2). Importantly, the optimal catalyst with a Fe/Co ratio of 2:3 exhibited very promising long-term stability with no evident change in the potential for both the ORR and the OER after 400 charge/discharge (OER/ORR) cycles at 15 mA cm(-2) in 6 m KOH. Moreover, detailed investigation of the structure, size, and phase composition of the mixed Fe/Co oxide nanoparticles, as well as their localization (inside of or on the surface of the MWCNTs) revealed insight of the possible contribution of the individual catalyst components and their synergistic interaction in the catalysis.									37	1	0	0	0	0	37			1864-5631	1864-564X		WOS:000430082200009	29359864

In this work, a new type of oxygen-deficient BaTiO3-x has been synthesized using a solgel method followed by a reductive heat treatment at 1300 degrees C in vacuum. The prepared perovskite nanoparticles have an average particle size on the order of 100 nm with uniform size distribution. X-ray diffraction shows that this perovskite catalyst consists of a significant amount of hexagonal BaTiO3-x. State-of-the-art IrO2 nanoparticles were also prepared in this work, which were used for reference and has excellent OER activity. Importantly, the oxygen-deficient perovskite catalysts exhibited high catalytic activity simultaneously for the ORR and the OER in alkaline electrolyte. The more challenged OER activity measured with the perovskite exceeds the IrO2 catalyst at relatively low potentials (<1.6 V) evidenced by a much reduced onset potential (1.32 V) and increased current density. In order to clearly elucidate the structure of the oxygen-deficient BaTiO3-x catalysts, X-ray and neutron diffraction experiments were further carried out, indicating that the hexagonal phase in the best performing BaTiO3-x catalyst is oxygen-deficient with a stoichiometry of BaTiO2.76. The oxygen vacancies in the perovskite crystal structure may lead to vastly enhanced electrocatalytic activity toward the ORR and OER. This work demonstrates a new type of highly efficient perovskite bifunctional catalyst for electrochemical energy technologies relying on oxygen electrocatalysis. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Here, we report the impressive electrocatalytic activity of the oxygen evolution reaction of Al-doped Ni(OH)2 deposited on a chemically etched carbon nanotube forest (CNT-F) supported on a flexible polymer/CNT nano composite. Our monolithic electrode generates a stable current density of 10 mA/cm(2) at an overpotential (eta) of 0.28 V toward the oxygen evolution reaction in 1 M NaOH and reaches approximately 200 mA/cm(2) at 1.7 V versus the reversible hydrogen electrode in 6 M KOH. The CNT-F/NiAI electrode also shows an outstanding activity for the hydrogen evolution reaction under alkaline conditions. When CNT-F/NiAI is used both at the anode and at the cathode, our device can sustain the overall water splitting, reaching 10 mA/cm(2) at eta = 1.96 V. The high electrocatalytic activity of the CNT-F/NiAI hydroxide is due to the huge surface area of the CNT forest, the high electrical conductivity of the nanocomposite substrate, and the interactions between the NiAI catalyst and the CNTs.									23	1	0	0	1	0	23			2155-5435			WOS:000405360800071

Here, a novel nitrogen-doped metal-carbon hybrid (NiCo/CN) with a unique 3D hierarchical structure, consisting of uniformly distributed bimetallic nanoparticles encapsulated by partially graphitized N-doped carbon shells, is fabricated by a one-step pyrolysis of a nanoscale metal-organic framework as precursor, which exhibits excellent activity for both ORR and OER. The surface chemical changes on the carbon hybrid probed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) reveal the presence of favorable electronic interaction at the metal-nitrogen-carbon interface. Remarkably, the NiCo/CN catalyst prepared at high temperature (800 degrees C) manifests a comparable performance to a commercial Pt/C catalyst for the ORR, but also superior stability, path selectivity and methanol tolerance. On the other hand, the E-onset (1.48 V vs. reversible hydrogen electrode) and Ej=10mA/cm2 of NiCo/CN-800 for OER is very close to the state-of-the-art noble catalyst RuO2 (E-onset = 1.46 and Ej=10mA/cm2) along with superior stability over 20 h of operation. The excellent catalytic property is attributable to the unique nanostructure, high porosity and the constructive synergistic effects of the elements M, N, and C.									11	0	0	0	0	0	11			2296-2646			WOS:000501153100001	31788468

Here, a simple methodology to tailor metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) to extract highly active multifunctional electrocatalysts on a large scale for oxygen reduction (ORR), oxygen evolution (OER), and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) is presented. The N, S codoped Fe2N decorated highly porous and defect-rich carbon nanosheets are grown using MOF xerogels, melamine, and polyvinylpyrollidone. The resulting catalyst exhibits excellent activity for ORR with an onset (0.92 V) and half-wave (0.81 V) potential similar to state-of-the-art Pt/C catalysts. The catalyst also shows outstanding OER and HER activities with a small overpotential of 360 mV in 1 m KOH and -123 mV in 0.5 m H2SO4 at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2), respectively. Excellent catalytic properties are further supported by theoretical calculations where relevant models are built and various possible activation sites are identified by first-principles calculations. The results suggest that the carbon atoms adjacent to heteroatoms as well as Fe-2-N sites present the active sites for improved catalytic response, which is in agreement with the experimental results.									61	2	0	0	2	0	61			1613-6810	1613-6829		WOS:000456503600018	30345628

However, the sluggish multi-step reaction of the oxygen is the main obstacle for the practical application of ZABs. Therefore, bifunctional electrocatalysts with high stability and activity for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) are greatly required to promote the catalytic reaction. In this review, we first explain the reaction mechanism of the ZABs, mainly focusing on multiple oxygen intermediates. Then, the latest studies on bifunctional electrocatalysts for the air cathodes and their progress of the ZABs are discussed with following aspects: platinum group metal, metal-free, transition metal, and metal compound-derived electrocatalysts. Finally, we highlight the advanced ZAB systems with the design of the full-temperature range operation, the all-solid-state, and the newly reported non-alkaline electrolyte, summarizing the remaining challenges and requirements of the future research directions.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			2041-6520	2041-6539		WOS:000792422000001	35733905

The relationship between the kinetic overvoltage of the oxygen reaction and discharge/charging overvoltage are studied in a Li-O-2 battery. It is found that the catalyst does not affect either the oxygen reduction kinetics or the Li-O-2 battery discharge overvoltage. M the same time, the charging overvoltage of a LiO2 battery with the catalyst is found to be lower than that of a Li-O-2 battery with the carbon material. It is shown that the latter effect is maybe more related to the structural changes of the cathode reaction product than to electrocatalysis of the oxygen evolution reaction.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			1388-2481	1873-1902		WOS:000432165800010

Herein, interfacial Co/CoMoN heterostructures supported on Ni foam (Co/CoMoN/NF) are constructed by thermal ammonolysis of CoMoOx. In 1.0 m KOH solution, Co/CoMoN/NF heterostructures exhibit excellent HER activity with an overpotential of 173 mV at 100 mA cm(-2) and a Tafel slope of 68.9 mV dec(-1). Density functional theory calculations indicate that the low valence state Co site acts as efficient water-dissociation promoter, while CoMoN substrate has favorable hydrogen adsorption energy, leading to an enhanced HER activity. The Co/CoMoN/NF heterostructures also achieve high OER activity with an overpotential of 303 mV at 100 mA cm(-2) and a Tafel slope of 56 mV dec(-1). Using Co/CoMoN/NF heterostructures as the cathode and anode, the alkaline electrolyzer requires a low voltage of 1.56 V to reach the current density of 100 mA cm(-2) along with superior long-term durability.

Cyclic voltammetry has been used to investigate the electro-catalytic performance of anode, and the morphology and structure of anode were characterized by FESEM. The results indicated that the Ru/Ir/Ti oxide composite anode exhibits lower oxygen evolution potential in anolyte and stable high electrocatalytic activity. The hydrogen evolution rates of cathode at different reaction conditions were experimentally measured in the electrocatalysis synthesis process of potassium dichromate.

Here we report a facile hydrothermal synthesis of NiMoO4 nanorods as active and stable OER catalyst in alkaline condition. The prepared NiMoO4 nanorods exhibit a considerably low overpotential of 340 mV at the current density of 10 mA/cm(2) and a low Tafel slope of 45.6 mV/dec, which is comparable to the benchmark RuO2. Furthermore, the performance of NiMoO4 significantly surpasses binary NiO and MoO3 oxides due to enhanced charge transfer and promoted formation of catalytically active Ni(3+ )species. The results highlight the importance of designing ternary oxides in oxygen electrocatalysis. (C) 2018 Chinese Chemical Society and Institute of Materia Medica, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences.

These are well described by the S-state model of Kok et al. [Kok, B., Forbush, B. & McGloin, M. (1970) Photochem. Photobiol. 11, 457-4751, with damping provided by empirical misses and double hits in the reaction center of photosystem II. Here we apply a mechanistic interpretation of misses as mainly determined by reaction centers that are inactive at the time of the flash due to the presence of either P+ or Q(A)-, according to the electron transfer equilibria on the donor and acceptor sides of the reaction center. Calculation of misses on this basis, using known or estimated values of the equilibrium constants for electron transfer between the S states and tyrosine Y(Z), between Y(Z) and P680, as well as between the acceptor plastoquinones, allows a natural description of the flash number dependence of oxygen evolution. The calculated misses are different for each flash-induced reaction center transition. Identification of this mechanism underlying the miss factor for each transition leads to the recognition of two different reaction sequence cycles of photosystem II, with different transition probabilities, producing an intrinsic heterogeneity of photosystem II activity.									61	0	1	0	52	0	62			0027-8424			WOS:A1993KP97900043	11607372

It provides reliable, scalable, and long-term energy storage, while helping in the decarbonization of the energy cycle. Such a storage medium is required for further deployment of photovoltaics, either for their inclusion into transportation and heavy industries or for supporting renewable grid management. The most accessible hydrogen source is water. However, fresh water is a scarce resource, while seawater is abundant worldwide. A major drawback of seawater electrolysis comes from chloride oxidation competing with the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). This may produce toxic products such as chlorine and also limits the hydrogen energy efficiency of the overall process. Thus, selective catalysts toward the OER are of strong technological interest. Here we report the electrocatalytic activity of heterogeneous cobalt hexacyanoferrate toward seawater oxidation. Combining experimental and computational studies, we highlight the great difficulty in obtaining such selectivity and its main mechanistic descriptors. This Prussian blue derivative is an excellent and robust OER electrocatalyst, but unfortunately, it is not selective enough toward the OER in the presence of Cl- anions. Faradaic efficiencies above 30% toward Cl-2 were observed during untreated seawater bulk electrolysis.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			2155-5435			WOS:000716773800029

Comparing the oxidative current efficiencies of these four electrodes in oxidation degradation of six organic pollutants (benzene, benzoic acid, phenol, aniline, nitrobenzene, methyl orange), the oxygen evolution potential and the transfer coefficient of oxidation reaction (betavalue) of electrode in various mediums were two important indexes for weighing whether the modified electrode could dispose efficiently the organic pollutant wastewater, in which the oxygen evolution potential of SnO2 electrode was the highest; thebeta value of PdO electrode was the largest and the next was the beta value of SnO2 electrode.

Herein, we report the in situ synthesis of a novel organic-inorganic composite directly onto carbon paste electrode (CPE) surface, as a robust substrate to incorporate Nickel-Iron (Ni-Fe) metal ions without using any binders or energy consumer techniques. Polyoxometalate (POM) and o-Anisidine (oA) are composite components that can be easily combined on the electrode surface (oA-POM/CPE). Ascribed to the synergy of context and metal ions, the as-prepared electrode affords a high catalytic activity and stability towards oxygen evolution reaction (OER), and gained a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at overpotential of 330 mV. Moreover, the distinct electrocatalytic activity is illustrated by varying the amount of Fe in immersion solution, which proves the change made in percentage ratio of Ni-Fe in immersion solution that consequently affects Ni-Fe percentage value on electrode surface. This represents the competition between metal cations in creating complex with composite. Collectively, this simple strategy provides a promising way for the development of effective and non-noble metal based OER electrocatalysts. (C) 2018 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC.

Herein, for the first time, highly dispersed cobalt nanoparticles decorated uniform nitrogen doped graphene (CoNPs-N-GR) was design synthesized. In the preparation procedure, graphene oxide (GO) was employed as supporting material, polydopamine as nitrogen source, location reagent as well as connecting agent for uploading cobalt metal ion, and then cobalt metal-organic frameworks (ZIF-67) in situ grew on GO. During the calcining process, GO reduction, nitrogen doping and cobalt nanoparticles forming were finished in one step. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images, transmission electron microscopy (TEM), energy-dispersive X-ray (EDS), X-ray photoelectron spectrometer (XPS) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) were applied to characterize the as-prepared CoNPs-N-GR. Moreover, owing to the presence of dopamine, high dispersed cobalt nanoparticles were obtained, leading to high electrocatalytic activity of CoNPs-N-GR for both hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in alkaline media. HER reaches 10 mA cm(-2) at the over-potential of 0.453 V with a Tafel slope of 67 mV dec(-1). OER reaches 10 mA cm(-2) at the over-potential of 1.63 V with a Tafel slope of 65 mV dec(-1). And the asprepared CoNPs-N-GR shows excellent durability in the long-term stability for HER and OER. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

Here we demonstrate such a material produced via an electrochemical process that is based on amorphous cobalt sulfide films doped with oxygen which are active for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) under alkaline conditions. The optimum electrochemical protocol was found to be a repetitive potential cycling approach rather than a constant potential to create an amorphous CoSx film containing oxygen. Samples with a Co : S ratio of 1.56 : 1 were found to be active for the HER in 0.5 M H2SO4, phosphate buffer and 0.1 M NaOH. Significantly this activity is comparable to highly crystalline nanomaterials of cobalt sulfide. Density functional theory calculations indicated that a reduced S-Co coordination number, as encountered in amorphous materials, leads to an optimum binding energy for hydrogen adsorption on the material which facilitates good electron transfer kinetics. In addition, this material was also active for the OER in alkaline conditions with evidence of conversion to cobalt oxide which gave a low overpotential of 370 mV for an applied current density of 10 mA cm(-2) with a Tafel slope of 67 mV dec(-1). This simple approach shows promise for the fabrication of a dual action electrocatalyst for electrochemical water splitting under alkaline conditions.									33	2	0	0	0	0	33			2046-2069			WOS:000418378100010

Molybdenum carbide (Mo2C), as a promising substitute for expensive Pt-based catalysts, exhibits outstanding electrocatalytic performance toward hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Herein, by combining theoretical studies and experimental measurements, we systematically investigate the surface stability and HER activity of Mo2C. We demonstrate that the Mo2C(100) surface is oxidized under HER turnover condition, and the HER activity shows a positive correlation with the oxidation degrees of this surface. The Mo2C(100) surface covered by a monolayer of oxygen atoms is verified as the most stable surface structure, which derives the optimum HER activity, and thus the surface chemisorbed oxygen atoms are identified as the active sites. This study provides new insights into developing efficient electrocatalysts for HER based on Mo2C. (C) 2020 Elsevier Inc.

However, these technologies require the use of highly active and stable catalysts to make these applications feasible. Current catalysts consist of precious metals such as platinum and iridium, which are expensive and block common access to electrochemical energy. Transition metals, and their oxides, serve as a promising alternative to these precious metals. due to their intrinsic activity and sufficient stability in oxidative electrochemical environments. Among wide range of these metals, cobalt, manganese, nickel, and iron, have been extensively explored as bifunctional catalysts, capable of simultaneously catalyzing oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) for energy storage and conversion. Not only do they show innate electrochemical capabilities, but their structural diversity, as well as their ability to be mixed, doped, and combined with other materials such as graphene, make transition metal oxides a highly attractive subject in electrochemical and materials research. This review serves to summarize the research currently available concerning transition metal oxides, and their applications as a bifunctional catalyst for the utilized fuel cells and rechargeable metal-air batteris in alkaline media. Particularly, oxide synthesis and their structural properties are related to their electrochemical abilities, along with their behavior when introduced to other catalytic materials and dopants.

Herein, three-dimensional Pt47Ni53 nanopolyhedrons (NPHs) with abundant active sites were constructed by a facile one-pot solvothermal strategy, in which cytosine and cetyltrimethylammonium chloride (CTAC) worked as the co-structure directing agents.

In this work, we deliberately devise a series of steps to obtain nickel oxide nanosheets on carbon nanotubes (NiO/CHT) for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and nickel oxide and nickel disulfide heterogeneous structures on CNTs (NiS2/NiO/CNT) for HER in alkaline conditions, respectively. The NiO/CNT sample shows an efficient OER activity in 1.0 M KOH and requires an overpotential of 310 mV to achieve a current density of 10 mA cm(-2). The NiS2/NiO/CNT sample with a heterogeneous structure drives a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at an overpotential of 93 mV in the 1.0 M KOH, presenting a significantly enhanced HER activity compared with that of the pure NiO and NiS2 phases. The potential of 1.62 V allows achieving a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) for overall water splitting with the NiS2/NiO/CNT and NiO/CNT catalysts as the cathode and anode, respectively.

In this paper,tried to develop an efficient Fe-rich OER electrocatalyst by coating a thin layer of Ni(oxy)hydroxide on a porous Fe (oxy)hydroxide electrodeposited on a substrate of carbon paper (CP). Due to the Ni/Fe contact with a large area on the surface, the clear interplay between Fe and Ni ions is observed through the X-ray photoelectron spectra, which demonstrates the partial charge transfer between them. When comparing with those of pure Fe (oxy)hydroxide/CP, pure Ni (oxy)hydroxide/CP, and traditional NiFe (oxy)hydroxide/CP, the as-prepared product of Ni (oxy)hydroxide/Fe (oxy)hydroxide/CP exhibits the best OER performance with a low overpotential of 223 mV at 10 mA cm(-2), a small Tafel slope of 32.S mV dec(-2), and a super stability of above 100 h continuous testing under 50 mA cm(-2). Such double-layer hierarchical architecture not only provides an enlarged surface area with sufficient active sites for the redox reactions but also possesses improved intrinsic OER activity due to the interaction between the metal ions. Moreover, the Fe-rich (oxy)hydroxide also processes good catalytic activity for hydrogen evolution reaction after dynamically self-optimizing, making it an efficient bifunctional catalyst with 1.53 V to drive 10 mA cm(-2) under basic solution in two-electrode measurements.									9	0	0	0	0	0	9			2168-0485			WOS:000503330400053

In this study, a hierarchical CoMoSx chalcogel was synthesized on a nickel foam (NF) through an in situ metathesis reaction and demonstrated excellent activity and stability in the electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction and oxygen evolution reaction in alkaline media. The high catalytic activity could be ascribed to the abundant active sites/defects in the amorphous framework and promotion of activity through cobalt doping. Furthermore, the superhydrophilicity and superaerophobicity of micro-/nanostructured CoMoSx/NF promoted mass transfer by facilitating access of electrolytes and ensuring fast release of gas bubbles.

Stainless steel and electrodeposited nickel are used as working electrode (WE) surface. The latter is obtained by electrodeposition on the two poles of a magnet. The influence and role played by the chiral compound in solution has been assessed by comparing the current values, in cyclic voltammetry (CV) experiments, recorded in the potential range at which oxygen evolution reaction (OER) occurs. In the case of tartaric acid and nickel WE a spin polarization of about 4% is found. The use of the chiral environment (bulk solution) and ferromagnetic chiral Ni electrode allows for observing the OER at a more favorable potential: About 50 mV (i.e., a cathodic, less positive, shift of the potential at which the oxygen evolution is observed).									5	0	0	0	1	0	5				1420-3049		WOS:000570125500001	32883035

The resulting electrocatalysts have a hybrid nanostructure of MgO-Co hybrid nanoparticles coated with NC shells. Although MgO itself is inactive for both OER and ORR, it still plays important roles in enhancing OER and ORR activity of MgO-Co/NC electrocatalysts. Of importance, a moderate content of MgO is highly required. Specifically speaking, MgO with moderate content is favorable for the resulting MgO-Co/NC electrocatalysts to achieve high ratios of O vacancy/total O (similar to 0.46), graphitic-N/total N (similar to 0.30) and Co3+/Co-0 (similar to 10.33), thus benefitting OER activity. Moreover, a moderate content of MgO also facilitates the formation of the abundant active Co2+ species and a high Co2+/Co-0 ratio (similar to 9.56) is obtained in the resulting MgO-Co/NC, which is in favor of ORR activity. The optimized electrocatalyst shows a low E-j=10 (similar to 1.56 V) for OER and a high value of E-1/2 (similar to 0.85 V) for ORR. Its overall bifunctional activity of Delta E (Delta E = E-j=10 - E-1/2) is as low as similar to 0.71 V. Its outstanding OER/ORR activity and bifunctional activity are comparable or even superior to precious metal electrocatalysts and recently reported Co-based bifunctional electrocatalysts.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000516818700010

These catalysts performed a synergistic catalytic effect. The catalytic activities towards hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) were enhanced by appropriate modification of Ni/Ni(OH)(2) at Ag electrode surface. Interestingly, the HER activity was further significantly enhanced after electrochemical tuning compared with that of before. Particularly for Ni(10 min)/Ag electrode surface, the overpotential of HER at 10 mA cm(-2) (E10 mA cm-2) was drastically decreased from -0.372 V to -0.148 V, which is merely 13 mV difference to the value obtained on Pt electrode surface (-0.135 V). Furthermore, the optimized catalyst also exhibited superior catalytic performance towards OER, thus strongly suggesting that it possesses excellent HER and OER bifunctional electrocatalytic activity and stability in alkaline solution. All the results from X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), scanning electron microscope (SEM), transmission electron microscope (TEM), energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) mappings and leadunderpotential deposition (Pb-UPD) indicated that more Ag species appeared on the Ni/Ni(OH)(2) modified Ag electrode surface and combined with Ni species to form a huge amount of the Ni/Ni(OH)(2)-Ag heterogeneous interfaces after electrochemical tuning process. It could be the crucial reason for the increase of the number of heterogeneous interfaces. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

In this study, nickel-iron-cobalt trimetallic PBAs, that is, NiFeCo(4 : 1)PBA nanocubes, were grown in situ on nickel foam (NF), which was subsequently calcined in air to obtain a composite electrode, NiO/FeOX/Co3O4@NF, with a loose porous hollow nanocube morphology. This structure remarkably enlarged the contact area between the electrolyte and the catalyst. In addition, a synergistic effect among these metallic oxides expedited oxygen evolution reaction (OER) kinetics. The Tafel slope (71.25 mV dec(-1)) toward OER of the constructed electrode is fairly small, much lower than that of our prepared bimetallic oxides@NF electrodes. The enduring stability is more than 22 h. This work indicates that, through morphology and composition control, the electrocatalytic performance of the designed electrode can be effectively improved.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			2196-0216			WOS:000591725400001

In recent years, energy conversion and storage technologies, such as water electrolysis and rechargeable metal over bar air batteries, have attracted tremendous research attention. Oxygen evolution reaction ( OER) is the core reaction of them. Remarkable OER electrocatalysts have been widely reported. The fabrication methods of electrocatalytic electrodes play a prominent role in the performance of the catalysts apart from the intrinsic activity of the catalysts. An increasing number of researchers are devoted to exploring the design and fabrication of high over bar performance OER electrodes. This review introduces the current fabrication strategies of OER electrodes, discusses their advantages and disadvantages with a summary of the latest research progress, and overviews the emerging approaches for new over bar type electrodes.

To address such issue, herein, for the first time, self-assembled three-dimensional porous nanoarchitecture, constructed by ultrathin cobalt-nickel-boron oxide (NiCoBOx) nanosheets, is synthesized by a facile borohydride/amine hydrolysis strategy. As an oxygen evolution electrocatalyst, the NiCoBOx nanoarchitecture delivers excellent performance with a very low overpotential of 290 mV to achieve 10 mA cm(-2) and a small Tafel slope of 59.2 mV dec(-1) in an alkaline medium, which is analogous to the performance of RuO2. Moreover, it shows outstanding physiochemical long-term stability with excellent current density retention even after 70 h. Its OER performance is reassessed to the benchmark catalyst and practically very virtuous within most reported Ni/Co-based OER electrocatalysts. The rationally designed 3D porous nanoarchitecture of borate anchored ultrathin NiCoOx nanosheets (NiCoB)-O-x favours the transportation of electrons and diffusion of ions during catalysis process, thus significantly enhancing its catalytic activity. This work provides a facile and low-cost synthesis strategy to fabricate 3D porous electrocatalyst with rational nanoarchitecture for highly efficient and stable OER. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Herein, we demonstrate for tyrosine-containing amino acid derivatives, peptides, and proteins that the selective oxidation of tyrosine to produce melanin or dityrosine can be readily realized by manipulating the oxygen concentration in the reaction system. This oxygen-dependent pathway selection reflects the selective chemical evolution of tyrosine to dityrosine and melanin in anaerobic and aerobic microorganisms, respectively. The resulting melanin- and dityrosine-containing nanomaterials reproduce key functions of their natural counterparts with respect to their photothermal and photoluminescent characteristics, respectively. This work reveals the plausible role of oxygen in the chemical evolution of tyrosine derivatives and provides a versatile strategy for the rational design of tyrosine-based multifunctional biomaterials.									54	5	0	0	6	0	53			1433-7851	1521-3773		WOS:000465413400008	30666757

In this work, dodecahedral MnCo2O4.5 hollowed-out nanocages are synthesized using a seed-mediated coordination chemistry of metal-organic frameworks. The hollowed-out MnCo2O4.5 nanocages used as bifunctional oxygen electrocatalysts exhibit high catalytic activity and excellent stability for both ORR and OER in alkaline media, which can be attributed to both the hierarchical porosity and stable hollowed-out structure that not only facilitate fast charge transfer reaction but also prevent the agglomeration of MnCo2O4.5 nanoparticles. The dodecahedral hollowed-out MnCo2O4.5 nanocages as the air electrode catalyst can deliver good stability in a rechargeable zinc-air battery. Scanning electron microscopy and transmission electron microscopy images, X-ray diffraction and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy of the electrocatalyst were measured again after durability tests. There is no significant influence on the morphologies, compositions, and structures before and after durability tests.									50	4	0	0	2	0	50			1614-6832	1614-6840		WOS:000452401000015

Herein, we report two-dimensional (2D) bimetallic phosphide (Co1-xFexP) ultrathin nanosheets as new OER catalysts. The two-dimensional (2D) morphology of the nanosheets and the synergistic effect between different transition-metal elements made contributions to the OER catalysis. By optimizing the doping ratio of the Fe atoms, the Co0.8Fe0.2P nanosheets showed the best OER performance with a small overpotential of 270 mV versus a rotating hydrogen electrode at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) and low Tafel slope of 50 mV dec(-1) in an alkaline electrolyte. Moderate iron doping improved the degree of oxidation at the surface of CoP nanosheets and preserved the conductive and chemically stabilizing host, thereby enhancing the OER activity. Our findings could aid the rational design of novel non-layered 2D nanomaterial OER catalysts.									32	3	0	0	0	0	32			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000468868200042	31065631

We have synthesized a series of stable MOFs (CTGU-10a1-d1) based on trinuclear metal carboxylate clusters and a hexadentate carboxylate ligand with a (6,6)-connected nia net. We also present a strategy to synthesize hierarchical bimetallic MOF nanostructures (CTGU-10a2-d2). Among these, CTGU-10c2 is the best material for the OER, with an overpotential of 240mV at a current density of 10mAcm(-2) and a Tafel slope of 58mVdec(-1). This is superior to RuO2 and confirms CTGU-10c2 as one of the few known high-performing pure-phase MOF-OER electrocatalysts. Notably, bimetallic CTGU-10b2 and c2 show an improved OER activity over monometallic CTGU-10a2 and d2. Both DFT and experiments show that the remarkable OER performance of CTGU-10c2 is due to the presence of unsaturated metal sites, a hierarchical nanobelt architecture, and the Ni-Co coupling effect.									336	21	0	0	11	0	337			1433-7851	1521-3773		WOS:000462655400020	30773762

The synthesis of high-entropy compounds, particularly high-entropy metal phosphides, has been seldom reported because of the incompatibility between different metals and non-metals. Herein, we propose a one-step low temperature sol-gel strategy to overcome the incompatibility and synthesize high-entropy metal phosphide (HEMP) NiCoFeMnCrP nanoparticles on a carbon matrix. Due to the synergistic effect among the metal elements, NiCoFeMnCrP exhibits supernormal catalytic activities for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and overall water splitting. The fact that the overpotentials for the OER and HER decrease with the increase of the metal species number demonstrates that the realization of high entropy has great effects on performance enhancement. Our work provides a facile and viable synthesis strategy for preparing high entropy compounds which would offer great potential in energy and electrocatalysis applications by entropy engineering.									20	0	0	0	0	0	20			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000684275100001

While catalysts made from noble metals possess high catalytic performance in both oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER), their scarcity and expensiveness significantly limit large-scale applications. In this regard, metal-free/non-noble metal carbon-based catalysts have become competitive alternatives to replace catalysts made of noble metals. Nevertheless, low catalytic ORR/OER performance is the challenge of carbon-based catalysts for the commercial applications of metal-air batteries. To solve the problem of poor catalytic performance, two strategies have been proposed: (1) controlling the microstructure of the catalysts to expose more active sites as the channels of rapid mass and electron transfer; and (2) reducing the reaction energy barrier by optimizing the electronic structures of the catalysts via surface engineering. Here, we review different types of bifunctional ORR/OER electrocatalysts with the activated surface sites. We focus on how the challenge can be overcome with different methods of material synthesis, structural and surface characterization, performance validation/optimization, to outline the principles of surface modifications behind catalyst designs. In particular, we provide critical analysis in the challenges that we are facing in structural design and surface engineering of bifunctional ORR/OER catalysts and indicate the possible solution for these problems, providing the society with clearer ideas on the practical prospects of noble-metal-free electrocatalysts for their future applications.

However, the preparation of excellent electrocatalysts and their utilizations are still great challenges. In this paper, the in situ enrichment of cobalt by sulfate-reducing bacteria (IEC-SRB-Xs) with more uncovered by-production was successfully cultured and carbonized to serve as the OER electrocatalysts triumphantly. The carbonized remains of IEC-SRB-1.00 (named SRB-1.00) showed an excellent potential 1.553 V at current density 10 mA cm(-2), and Tafel slope was 47 mV dec(-1). Moreover, the SRB-1.00 performed constant activity and without any decline of activity after 24 h of OER testing. In addition, the SRB-1.00 exhibited high electron transfer efficiency of 0.803. Therefore, The IEC-SRB-Xs have potential to be a new approach to prepare OER electrocatalyst for water oxidation.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0947-7047	1862-0760		WOS:000496712400029

To make seawater electrolysis sustainable, the activity of electrocatalysts may not be the only parameter, but the selectivity of the efficient oxygen evolution reaction suppressing the corrosive chlorine chemistry is highly desirable. Thereby, the current review not only focuses on fundamentals to understand the mechanisms involved in the anode and cathode, but also discusses different electrocatalysts, factors affecting their performance, and finally the rational design of electrolyzers finding the possibilities towards commercialization.									34	1	0	0	2	0	35			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000607307900002

In this paper, we are reporting a simple and effective route to introduce nitrogen functionalities coordinated with Fe to generate ORR active Fe-N-4 species. Fe-N-C catalytic sites are known to play an active role towards ORR; however, the higher oxidation state of Fe has been speculated to be good for OER. This method generates a mixture of numerous ORR active and OER active phases. The superior ORR activity of the catalyst, prepared by annealing at 800 degrees C consists of the mixed phases of Fe-N-4,N- Fe3O4, and Fe3C. The oxygen bifunctional activity measured in terms of Delta E value (1.06 V) makes it suitable for the cathode of an aqueous zinc-air battery. The catalyst remains stable for approximately 63 h of continuous charging-discharging cycles with a high specific capacity of 689 mAh g(-1) with a constant charge-discharge voltage gap.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0013-4651	1945-7111		WOS:000749308800001

Here, the Co3Mo3N-400/NF is prepared using a facial way, which exhibits remarkable catalytic performances for UOR, hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and overall urea electrolysis (OUE) because of the more exposed active sites and high electrical conductivity. At 100 mA/cm(2), the Co3Mo3N-400/NF shows a small potential of 1.356 V vs. RHE (reversible hydrogen electrode) for UOR, which is much lower than that for OER. Furthermore, for HER, to reach to 100 mA/cm(2), a low overpotential of 299 mV is required, and the urea has negligible influence on the HER process. For OUE, the Co3Mo3N-400/NF||Co3Mo3N-400/NF shows a small cell potential of 1.481 V at 100 mA/cm(2) along with a good durability.

However, the role of chalcogens for OER process has been ignored and not fully elucidated. Herein, it is discovered that about 2.8-3.5% of chalcogens remain in as oxidized derivatives at a steady state, which plays a vital role for enhancing the catalytic activity. A facile and spontaneous sulfurizing method is developed to synthesize sulfur-doped NiCo-(oxy)hydroxysulfides (NCOSH) nanosheets, in which the sulfur can directly bond with high-valence TMs and keep them stable for OER catalysis. Theoretical and experimental results suggest that the S-coordination in NCOSH can cause bond length strengthening and electronic modulation between TM-S and TM-O, thus enhancing the oxidation activity and stability of high-valence TMs in NCOSH. Consequently, the as-obtained NCOSH exhibits superior bifunctional activities and durability for oxygen electrocatalytic reactions, and also serves as a superb air cathode in rechargeable solid state Zn-air batteries. This work sheds light on the rational design of (oxy)hydroxysulfides as efficient electrocatalysts and gains deeper fundamental insights on the enhancing mechanism of S in oxyhydroxysulfides for diverse electrochemical applications.									10	0	0	0	0	0	10			1614-6832	1614-6840		WOS:000761171700001

Various methods have been employed to enhance the activity and long-term stability of the electrodes. The phenomenon of surface species reconstruction has been reported many times in the actual operation of catalysts. Herein, an efficient integrated trimetallic Cr-NiZn layered double hydroxides (LDH) electrocatalyst was systematically synthesized by one-step electrodeposition. The time- and concentrationoptimized Cr-NiZn LDH catalyst for oxygen evolution reaction can achieve a current density of 50 mA cm-2 at a low overpotential of 292 mV in a 1.0 M KOH electrolyte. The high-performance was attributed to the reconstruction of surface-active substances and the formation of oxygen defects. The research shows that doping can promote the reconstruction process and increase the number of defects to a greater extent. This feasible modulation strategy can be also be applied in other energy catalysis fields.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0927-7757	1873-4359		WOS:000818763400002

Both of them require robust oxygen electrocatalysts improving electrical efficiency. In this work, we use cobalt compounds to modify (La, Sr)MnO3 (LSM) by a hydrothermal method to ameliorate the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) performance. The effects of loading amounts and phase-microstructure of the cobalt phase by adjusting the calcination temperature are systematically investigated. Much improved OER geometrical, specific and mass activities over its individual phase, an onset voltage of 1.38 V and the lowest voltage of 1.68 V at 10 mA cm(-2) that are among the best values based on LSM matrix electrocatalysts in the open literature, are obtained. The increased surface oxygen vacancy concentration, water absorption capability, and the modulated surface cations' electronic structure are ascribed to be the source of the significantly improved electrochemical properties. LSM-Co-RT-12 also showed good durability in constant voltage testing for 10 h. Therefore, integrating with the intrinsically high oxygen reduction activity, the LSM-Co hybrid catalyst possesses promise for bi-functionality oxygen electrocatalysis. This work also highlights the surface modification is an effective method to modify the intrinsic activity of OER inert perovskite materials for the multifunctional application.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			0920-5861	1873-4308		WOS:000632009100002

A lowering of the ORR overpotential by 100 mV for the BSCF/Carbon composite electrode compared to BSCF without carbon was observed, while for the OER the overpotential was reduced by some 65 mV.

The catalysts were synthesized by metal-organic chemical vapor deposition using ruthenium carbonyl (Ru-3(CO)(12)) as Ru precursor. The obtained RuO2/OCNT and RuO2/NCNT composites were characterized using TEM, H-2-TPR, XRD and XPS in order probe structure-activity correlations, particularly, the effect of the different surface functional groups on the electrochemical OER performance. The electrocatalytic activity and stability of the catalysts with mean RuO2 particle sizes of 13-14 nm was evaluated by linear sweep voltammetry, cyclic voltammetry, and chronopotentiometry, showing that the generation of nitrogen-containing functional groups on CNTs was beneficial for both OER activity and stability. In the presence of RuO2, carbon corrosion was found to be significantly less severe. (C) 2016 Science Press and Dalian Institute of Chemical Physics.

Here we developed copper and cobalt-based oxide/iron hydroxide hybrid nanowire arrays (CuCoOx/FeOOH) via a three-step growth-annealing-conversion approach. These hybrid nanowires offer a large surface area for electrocatalytic sites, abundant pores for fast electrolyte access, efficient charge transfer, and strong coupling between CuCoOx and FeOOH components. Attributed to these features, the CuCoOx/FeOOH nanowires exhibit excellent bifunctional oxygen evolution reaction and oxygen reduction reaction activities, including low overpotentials, high current densities, and outstanding stabilities. Using the CuCoOx/FeOOH electrocatalyst as the oxygen electrode, a rechargeable zinc-air battery was fabricated to exhibit a small charge-discharge overpotential (0.75 V at 10 mA.cm(-2)) and a long-term cycling stability (150 cycles), thus suggesting new bifunctional electrocatalysts for energy conversion and storage applications.									93	6	0	0	3	0	94			2380-8195			WOS:000415914200046

Highly active and cost-effective catalysts for oxygen/hydrogen evolution reactions (OERs/HERs) are desired to suppress the intrinsically significant overpotential of these reactions. Perovskite-related transition-metal oxides have been widely investigated as promising candidates for electrochemical catalysts, whereas their complex composition and structure inhibit the elucidation of essential factors for activating HER. Herein, we report a systematic study on predominant factors affecting HER catalysis for Co-containing perovskite-related oxides. The A-site-ordered double perovskite oxide PrBaCo2O6-delta exhibits HER activity with a volcano-type plot associated with oxygen deficiency content, and shows the highest activity at a moderate value of delta = 0.2, in addition to the significant superiority to the simple ABO(3)-type perovskite, ACoO(3) (A = La, La0.5Ca0.5, Ca). Based on the Tafel slope, electric conductivity, and charge-transfer resistance analyses, we have found that complementary factors dominate the HER catalysis; Co-O covalency and water dissociation site, which are respectively induced by high Co valence and oxygen deficiency. This finding provides new insight into the rational design of transition-metal oxide catalysts for HER.									13	3	0	0	0	0	14				2052-1537		WOS:000534239200022

The efficiency of water electrolysis is, however, limited by the sluggish oxygen evolution reaction (OER) at the anode, for which IrO2-based electrodes are considered to be the best compromise of a stable and reasonably active OER electrocatalyst in acidic medium. To improve existing OER electrocatalysts and to advance a rational search of promising alternative electrode materials, it is imperative to identify the rate determining step (rds). We apply here the concept of the free energy diagram along the reaction coordinate to identify the rate-determining step (rds) in the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) over an IrO2(110) model anode in both acidic and basic media. The free energy diagram as a function of the applied electrode potential is constructed from experimental Tafel plots and ab initio Pourbaix diagrams. Quite in contrast to common perception, the rds for the OER over IrO2(110) at high overpotentials is identified with the decomposition of the OOH adsorbate via a decoupled electron-proton transfer to form gaseous O-2. Combining linear scaling relationships with the free energy diagram approach leads to the introduction of kinetic scaling relations, which allow us to predict the rate-determining step (rds) of the OER over general transition metal oxide electrocatalysts in the high-overpotential regime by a single descriptor, namely, the free formation energy of oxygen with respect to the OH adsorbate (Delta G(2)) on the anode surface. On the basis of kinetic scaling relations we suggest that further improvement of the catalytic OER performance may require a decoupling of the electron-proton transfer in the rds.									69	2	0	0	1	0	70			2155-5435			WOS:000480503700017

Herein, we directly grow a small amount of Co-doped SnS2 nanosheet array on the surface of carbon fiber by a simple one-step solvothermal method and study the effect of different Co/Sn ratio (x = 0, 0.05, 0.15, 0.25) on the morphology of SnS2. The Co-doped SnS2 nanosheet array with x = 0.15 exhibited the most active sites and the most excellent OER performance. It has an overpotential of 281 mV at a current density of 30 mA cm(-2) and a low Tafel slope of 62 mV dec(-1), which is much lower than pure SnS2. Such good performance is attributed to the high intrinsic activity and superaerophobic surface property.									25	0	0	0	1	0	25			0022-2461	1573-4803		WOS:000482115200020

The vast chemical space of intermetallic phases offers plenty of opportunities to discover OER electrocatalysts with improved performance. Herein we report intermetallic nickel germanide (NiGe) acting as a superior activity and durable Ni-based electro(pre)catalyst for OER. It is produced from a molecular bis(germylene)-Ni precursor. The ultra-small NiGe nanocrystals deposited on both nickel foam and fluorinated tin oxide (FTO) electrodes showed lower overpotentials and a durability of over three weeks (505 h) in comparison to the state-of-the-art Ni-, Co-, Fe-, and benchmark NiFe-based electrocatalysts under identical alkaline OER conditions. In contrast to other Ni-based intermetallic precatalysts under alkaline OER conditions, an unexpected electroconversion of NiGe into gamma-(NiOOH)-O-III with intercalated OH-/CO32- transpired that served as a highly active structure as shown by various ex situ methods and quasi in situ Raman spectroscopy.									62	1	0	0	4	0	62			1433-7851	1521-3773		WOS:000613823700001	33169889

A solar fuels device couples a solar photoabsorber with catalysts to convert solar energy to chemical energy via reactions such as oxygen evolution (water splitting). Widespread deployment of this technology hinges upon discovery of new materials through efforts such as the high throughput screening of oxygen evolution catalysts, as discussed in this manuscript. We derive an expression for the efficiency of the oxygen evolution catalyst that combines catalytic and optical properties. Using this hybrid efficiency, we screen 5456 samples in a (Fe-Co-Ni-Ti)O-x. pseudo-quaternary catalyst library using automated, high throughput electrochemical and optical experiments. The observed compositional trends in this catalyst efficiency lead to the discovery of a new high performance composition region. (C) 2013 The Electrochemical Society.

In this present study, 11 transition metal atoms supported on a graphdiyne (GDY) monolayer (TM@GDY, where TM represents a transition metal from Sc to Zn and Pt) as electrocatalysts are investigated by means of first-principle calculations. It is found that the supported single atom is very stable at the corner of the acetylenic ring. These features can help in the realization of uniformly distributed and well-ordered single atoms on GDY. Few composites viz Sc@GDY, Ti@GDY, V@GDY, Fe@GDY, and Pt@GDY display high catalytic activity toward hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Especially for Ti@GDY and V@GDY, both C and TM are active sites which are the best HER catalysts among the studied composites. Moreover, Pt@GDY and Ni@GDY composites can be promising bifunctional electrocatalysts for water splitting [0.01 and 0.46 V for HER and oxygen evolution reaction (OER)] and metal-air-battery (0.29 and 0.40 V for OER and oxygen reduction reaction) catalysts, respectively. This work demonstrates that GDY is indeed a promising single-atom support which can be considered for the design of high activity and inexpensive multifunctional electrocatalysts for practical catalytic applications.									131	11	0	0	5	0	132			2366-9608			WOS:000485927700016

Efficient yet stable low-cost OER catalysts have been widely explored but further improvement is still highly demanded. Herein, a type of hybrid OER catalyst was prepared by the growth of CoFe-LDH (layered double hydroxide) on the surface of Ti3C2 MXene nanosheets, which exhibits superior OER performance than the state-of-the-art RuO2. The enhancement of the OER performance could be attributed to the combination of oxygen-breaking ability of CoFe-LDH and metallic conductivity of Ti3C2 MXene substrate. Meanwhile, the direct growth of CoFe-LDH on the hydroxyl-rich surface of MXene effectively prevents itself from aggregation, exposing more CoFe-LDH edge active sites. What's more important is that the intimate interface between CoFe-LDH and Ti3C2 MXene brings in efficient charge transfer and oxygen activation, which is supported by the DFT calculation results. The direct growth of CoFe-LDH on MXene endows the insulating LDH with metallic features with the O 2p states become distributed above the Fermi level which is mediated by the possible anionic redox process. This work demonstrates the great potential of MXene-based hybrid nanostructure for energy conversion applications. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

In this work, two-dimensional (2D) graphdiyne (GDY) with uniform distributed pores was applied to cover the Pt surface for catalyzing HER and ORR through density functional theory (DFT) calculations. The 2D confinement induced by GDY was found to improve the catalytic performance of the Pt catalyst from three aspects: (1) the 2D covering layer increases the stability of the Pt catalyst through forming the heterogeneous interface of GDY/Pt(111); (2) GDY/Pt(111) shows better catalytic activities of HER and ORR, with the smaller average overpotential values of 0.26 and 0.51 V, respectively, compared with those (0.29 V for HER, 0.62 V for ORR) on the Pt catalyst; (3) the confinement effect of GDY weakens the adsorption energy of CO to -1.81 eV (average value) from -2.14 eV on Pt(111), inhibiting CO poisoning. This work sheds new light on 2D confinement effects for HER and ORR, which opens up a new strategy for improving the catalytic performance of Pt-based catalysts.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000709458200020	34582181

The single-atom platinum supported catalyst greatly improves the utilization of platinum, but the catalytic activity and selectivity are greatly affected by the platinum coordination environment, and the preparation of the material is difficult. Doping base metals to adjust the electronic structure of platinum is an effective strategy to improve catalyst performance. In this work, copper-platinum alloy nanoparticles were loaded on N-doped porous carbon via a targeted route guided by highly dispersed Cu atoms derived from MOF. The product C-ZIF-CuPt has high activity and high stability ORR, HER bifunctional catalytic performance, which is better than commercial Pt/C (20 wt%). The Pt activity in C-ZIF-CuPt is 4.4 times (ORR) and 6.7 times (HER) than Pt/C. Spectromicroscopic determinations unveiled that strong interactions between carbon carrier and the CuPt alloys contribute to the overall stabilities. DFT calculations show that Cu doping can increase the d-band center of Pt, reduce the ORR overpotential, and the activation energy barrier to water molecules, which is beneficial to ORR and HER catalysis. Under the same carrier conditions, the performance of sub-nano (single atoms, clusters) platinum supported catalysts (C-ZIF-Cu-Pt) is inferior to C-ZIF-CuPt. This further shows that platinum alloying can effectively improve the performance of the catalyst.									9	0	0	0	1	0	9			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000713702500003

However, such devices have long been suffering from the sluggish reaction kinetics and high energy barriers, plus the conventional electrocatalysts used in these devices mostly are noble-metal-based materials, such as Pt/C, IrO2, and RuO2. These noble-metal-based electrocatalysts possess significant disadvantages such as high price, limited reserves, and undesirable stability, and these factors together hinder their large-scale industrial application and the inhomogeneity of the catalyst structure at the atomic level also impose great challenges to disclose the underlying catalytic mechanism. Noble metal nanoclusters, as a promising type of electrocatalyst with definitive composition and structure, have been attracting increasingly research efforts. This review aims to summarize the recent achievements of molecular metal nanoclusters employed in electrocatalytic processes, with particular elaboration on oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), oxygen evolution reaction (OER), as well as to unravel the catalytic mechanism and establish the relationship between its structure and functionality. Specifically, the size effect, the metal core configuration, charge effect, size effect, ligand effect, and metal-ligand binding motifs of the metal clusters that would impact the electrocatalytic performance are comprehensively discussed. In the end, the outlook and perspective including challenges and opportunities are proposed. We anticipate this review would be beneficial for gaining a deeper understanding of engineering nanoclusters for electrocatalysis and to expand its application in electrocatalysis.

While many transition metal oxides work reasonably well in basic media, very few alternatives are available in neutral or acidic media. One promising candidate comes from the Prussian blue family, cobalt hexacyanoferrate. This electrocatalyst offers robust activity in a large pH range (0 < pH < 13), although current densities are limited due to slow charge transfer kinetics. Herein, we report how the partial substitution of catalytically active Co centres by additional Fe boosts current densities, reaching over 100 mA/cm2, more than double the performance of the parent Co2[Fe(CN)6]. Those new results clearly increase the opportunity for this catalyst to become relevant in industrial-ready electrolyser architectures.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6				2073-4344		WOS:000516825000129

Herein, ultrathin Fe-Mn-O hetero-nanosheets consisting of crystalline e-Fe2O3 intercalated in amorphous Fe-doped 6-MnO2 have been fabricated through facile alkali hydrolysis of FeMn-based coordination polymer. Abundant Mn3+ active sites and oxygen vacancies are generated in Fe-doped 6-MnO2 layer due to in-layer/interlayer reformations, where interstitial e-Fe2O3 is engineered to reinforce stability and conductivity. The optimal 0.5Fe-Mn-O nanosheets exhibit superb activity with low overpotentials of 258 (322) mV at 10 (300) mA cm-2 for OER together with strong stability under large current density over 100 h, ranking it among the best MnO2-based electrocatalysts. Importantly, in situ interlayer reconstruction from e-Fe2O3 to fl-FeOOH during OER has been unveiled, the evolved fl-FeOOH triggers strong interfacial electronic coupling, which synergizes with oxygen vacancies and Fe3+ dopants to modulate surface electronic structure of 6-MnO2 for intermediates adsorption.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000795646100005

Pure and Ni-modified Co3O4(1 1 1) film electrodes were prepared and characterized under ultrahigh-vacuum conditions by scanning tunneling microscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. Both Ni decoration (by post-deposition of Ni) and Ni doping (by simultaneous vapor deposition of Ni, Co, and O-2) induced distinct differences in the base cyclic voltammograms in 0.5 m KOH at potentials higher than 0.7 V compared with Co3O4(1 1 1) electrodes. Also, all oxide film electrodes showed a higher overpotential for the ORR but a lower one for the OER than polycrystalline Pt. Ni modification significantly improved the ORR current densities by increasing the electrical conductivity, whereas the OER onset of approximately 1.47 V-RHE (RHE: reversible hydrogen electrode) at 0.1 mA cm(-2) was almost unchanged.									18	0	0	0	2	0	18			1864-5631	1864-564X		WOS:000531330700001	32216087

For the electron transfers from the (Mn)(4)/H2O complex to Y-Z(.), S-state dependent kinetic isotope effects were observed with k(H)/k(D) values of 2.9, 1.3 and 1.6 for the transitions S-1 --> S-2, S-2 --> S-3 and S-3 --> [S-4] --> S-0, respectively. In tris-washed samples, oxygen evolution is abolished and the reduction of Y-Z(.) proceeds at the same rate in (H2O)-H-1 and in (H2O)-H-2. Taken together, these results show that proton-electron coupling during the reduction of Y(Z)(.)is in effect when water is the electron donor to PSII, but not when oxygen evolution is inhibited. This conclusion is consistent with a mechanism for oxygen evolution in which Y-Z(.) abstracts a hydrogen atom from the (Mn)(4)/H2O complex on each S-state transition. By demonstrating proton/electron coupling, our data suggest that these hydrogen atom abstraction reactions proceed along a pathway that has a concerted character. The atom transfer character in the transition state serves to minimize charge development during the SnYZ. --> Sn+1YZ reactions and is consistent with the relatively low activation energies observed in the S-state transitions in PSII.

The as-synthesized FeSe2 was electrophoretically deposited on nickel foam and applied to the oxygen and hydrogen evolution reactions (OER and HER, respectively) in alkaline media. When used as an oxygen-evolution electrode, a low 2,15 mV overpotential was achieved at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2), representing outstanding catalytic activity and stability because of Fe(OH)/FeOOH active sites formed at the surface of FeSe2. Remarkably, the system is also favorable for the HER. Moreover; an overall water-splitting setup was fabricated using a two-electrode cell, which displayed a low cell voltage and high stability. In summary, the first iron selenide material is reported that can be used as a bifunctional electrocatalyst for the OER and HER, as well as overall water splitting.									129	5	1	0	8	0	130			1433-7851	1521-3773		WOS:000434546000041	28678439

However, due to the easy decomposition, the catalytic properties of silver salt oxide are difficult to characterize by conventional methods. Herein, we used a closed-type wireless nanopore electrode (CWNE) to in situ and real-time monitor the electrocatalytic performance of Ag7NO11 in the oxygen evolution reaction. The real-time current recording revealed that the deposited Ag7NO11 on the CWNE tip greatly enhanced the oxidative capacity of the electrode, resulting in water splitting. The statistical event analysis reveals the periodic O2 bubble formation and dissolution at the Ag7NO11 interface, which ensures the characterization of the oxygen evolution electrocatalytic process at the nanoscale. The calculated kcat and Markov chain modeling suggest the anisotropy of Ag7NO11 at a low voltage may lead to multiple catalytic rates. Therefore, our results demonstrate the powerful capability of CWNE in direct and in situ characterization of gas-liquid-solid catalytic reactions for unstable catalysts.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0003-2700	1520-6882		WOS:000874564100001	36255225

However, the efficiency of these electrocatalysis processes is usually hindered by the slow OER kinetics. Meanwhile, the oxidative reaction condition of OER also poses a great challenge for the long-term stability of OER catalysts. In this work, through anodic oxidation, hydrothermal reaction and calcination, a self-supported, efficient and stable OER catalyst (Co@TiO2/Ti) was developed by loading Co nanoparticles on TiO2 nanotube array rooted on Ti foil. The TiO2 array substrate not only offers good corrosion resistance under the strong oxidative reaction condition of OER, but also provides an increased surface area for depositing the catalytic active Co-based catalysts. As a result, the Co@TiO2/Ti catalyst shows excellent OER activity exhibiting an overpotential of 382 mV (j=50 mA cm(-2)) and onset potential of 1.46 V vs. RHE in 1M KOH solution. Importantly, it also achieves a high stability at high current density operating condition. In addition, post-OER reaction characterizations show that the Co nanoparticles were oxidized into Co3O4 crystals, suggesting that the latter was the real component in catalyzing OER reaction. The self-supported efficient and stable catalyst and the insights revealed in the real OER catalysis phase advanced the development of OER catalysts. (C) 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

However, the development of this technology has been greatly hampered by the lack of efficient electrocatalysts and the detrimental effects of chlorine electrochemistry. Herein, we report a defect-rich low-crystalline Rh metallene (l-Rh metallene) with an amorphous/crystalline hetero-phase structure for seawater electrolysis, where chlorine generation is avoided by replacing the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) with the hydrazine oxidation reaction (HzOR). Benefiting from the large surface-to-volume ratio, abundant active sites and unique electronic structure, the l-Rh metallene exhibits out-standing catalytic activity for both hydrogen evolution reaction (HER,-38 mV at 10 mA cm(-2)) and HzOR (-2 mV at 10 mA cm(-2)). Notably, an ultra-low voltage of only 28 mV is required to achieve 10 mA cm-2 in two-electrode hydrazine-assisted seawater splitting system.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000804054800006

MXene is a new type of nanometer 2D sheet material, which exhibits great application potentials in various fields due to its multiple advantages such as high specific surface area, good electrical conductivity, and high mechanical strength. Electrocatalysis is regarded as the core of future clean energy conversion technologies, and MXene-based materials provide inspiration for the design and preparation of electrocatalysts with high activity, high selectivity, and long loading life time. The applications of MXene-based materials in electrocatalysis, including hydrogen evolution reaction, nitrogen reduction reaction, oxygen evolution reaction, oxygen reduction reaction, carbon dioxide reduction reaction, and methanol oxidation reaction are summarized in this review. As a crucial session regarding experiments, the current safer and more environmentally friendly preparation methods of MXene are also discussed. Focusing on the materials design and enhancement methods, the key challenges and opportunities for MXene-based materials as a next-generation platform in both fundamental research and practical electrocatalysis applications are presented. This account serves to promote future efforts toward the development of MXenes and related materials in the electrocatalysis applications.									111	3	0	0	3	0	111			1616-301X	1616-3028		WOS:000545751900001

However, due to the slow reaction kinetics and complex electron transfer process, the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) occurring at the anode has become a bottleneck. Herein, the metal-defective Co3-xO4 was selected as the electron-acceptor carrier and Co3-xO4/NiO was synthesized by a simple two-step method. The results show that Co3-xO4/NiO has a low overpotential of 240 mV and 320 mV at 10 mA center dot cm(-2) and 100 mA center dot cm(-2), a low Tafel slope of 64 mV/dec, and the electrochemical surface area (ECSA) of Co3-xO4/NiO is as high as 1033.3 cm(2). Moreover, the decrease in activity after the 60 h stability testing is negligible. Combining experiments and theoretical calculations, the high activity and stability of Co3-xO4/NiO is attributed to the tunable electronic structure, and more electrons are transferred from NiO to Co3-xO4 which leads to the in-situ generation of more Ni3+ as active sites. The Co3-xO4/NiO with abundant of Ni3+ can effectively regulate the oxygen-containing intermediates (OH*, O* and OOH*) with appropriate binding energy, reduce Gibbs free energy change of rate-limiting step, and accelerate OER reaction kinetics. This work provides an efficient strategy to generate and stabilize Ni3+ active sites and confirms the key catalytic role of Ni3+ in the OER process.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000805852100005

Herein, a nickel foam supported CoTe2 nanofilm electrode is successfully introduced via a single-step hydrothermal process. As revealed by density function theory studies, the unique electronic configuration of CoTe2 endows the material with a high density of state near Fermi level favorable for charge transfer in catalytic reactions. This structural merit along with the high electrochemical active surface area of the novel CoTe2 nanofilm electrode enable a high activity of the electrode for both hydrogen evolution and oxygen evolution reactions. A full water splitting device with the CoTe2 nanofilm electrode as both anode and cathode could reach a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at a low potential of 1.605 V. Furthermore, a good stability of the bifunctional catalyst is also demonstrated. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.									31	2	0	0	2	0	32			0013-4686	1873-3859		WOS:000464956000049

Detailed analyses revealed that the NiFe LDH phase around the nanopores can be preferentially oxidized into electroactive Fe:NiOOH phase. In addition, the buffering space provided by the nanopores can effectively avoid structural deformation during repeated redox cycling, leading to better electrochemical stability, which synergistically make the catalyst a promising candidate for commercial water splitting. This work highlights the positive role of porous structure in accelerating the formation of active phases beyond just increment of surface area, which can provide insight in designing advanced catalysts.									74	6	0	0	3	0	74			2211-2855	2211-3282		WOS:000448994600009		
J	Shinkarev, VP								Oxygen evolution in photosynthesis: Simple analytical solution for the Kok model								BIOPHYSICAL JOURNAL				85	1			435	441		10.1016/S0006-3495(03)74488-9				JUL 2003	2003	The light-induced oxidation of water by Photosystem II (PS II) of higher plants, algae, and cyanobacteria, is the main source of atmospheric oxygen. The discovery of the flash-induced period four oscillations in the oxygen evolution made by Pierre Joliot in 1969 has a lasting impact on current photosynthesis research. Bessel Kok explained such oscillations by introducing the cycle of flash-induced transitions of states (S-states) of an oxygen-evolving complex governed by the values of miss and double hit. Although this Kok model has been successfully used over 30 years for interpretation of experimental data in photosynthesis, until now there has been no simple analytical solution for it. Such an analytical solution for individual S-states and for oxygen evolution is presented here. When only the S, state is present before flash series, and when both the miss and double hit are zero, the oxygen evolved by the PSII after the n(th) flash, Y(n), is given by the following equation: 4Y(n) = 1 + (-1)(n-1) - 2 cos((n - 1)pi/2). It is found here that binary oscillations of the secondary acceptor semiquinone at the acceptor side of the reaction center of PS II and release of reducing equivalents from reaction center to b(6)f complex can also be determined in the framework of the Kok model. The simple solutions found here for individual S-states, semiquinone, and oxygen evolution provide a basis for quantitative description of the charge accumulation processes at the donor and acceptor sides of PS II. It also provides a rare example of a significant problem in biology, which can be solved analytically.									19	0	0	0	15	0	20			0006-3495			WOS:000183820600041	12829498

However, the slow and incomplete self-reconstruction from TMOs to (oxy)hydroxides as well as the formed (oxy)hydroxides with unmodified electronic structure gives rise to the inferior OER performance to the noble metal oxide ones. Herein, a unique dual metal oxides lattice coupling strategy is proposed to fabricate carbon cloth-supported ultrathin nanowires arrays, which are composed of pseudo-periodically welded NiO with CeO2 nanocrystals (NiO/CeO2 NW@CC). When served as an OER precatalyst in 1.0 m KOH, the NiO/CeO2 NW@CC shows an ultralow overpotential of 330 mV at 50 mA cm(-2), along with an impressive cycle durability of more than 3 days even at 50 mA cm(-2), surpassing CC-supported NiO and commercial IrO2 catalysts. The combined experimental and theoretical investigations unveil that the atomic coupling of CeO2 can not only appreciably trigger the generation of oxygen vacancies and expedite phase transformation of NiO into active NiOOH, but also in situ create a chemical bond with the formed NiOOH and enable the electron injection, thus effectively inhibiting the aggregation of the accessible NiOOH nanodomains and optimizing their reaction free energy towards oxygen-containing intermediates.									13	0	0	0	0	0	13			1613-6810	1613-6829		WOS:000669236600001	34216433

However, there is still a lack of effective ways to tune the catalysts performance for the OER reaction from the aspect of structure design and element modulation simultaneously. Herein, a novel Cu0.33Co0.67S2 hexagonal nanosheet has been synthesized through the coprecipitation reaction followed by subsequent vapor sulfidation. Simply mixed with carbon nanotubes (CNTs) during electrode preparation, this Cu0.33Co0.67S2 exhibits an overpotential of 284 mV vs. RHE at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) in 1.0 M KOH. The improved OER performance of the Cu0.33Co0.67S2 electrode can be attributed to the electrocatalytically active sites involved in octahedral coordination structures and further activated by Cu substitution. The encouraging results provide insight into further rational design of transition metal-based electrochemical catalysts towards OER applications.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4				2046-2069		WOS:000464595600048	35520737

Substitution by heteroatoms with high electron-donating ability may be a feasible strategy for triggering O-vacancies to maintain thermodynamic stability. Herein, density functional theory (DFT) calculations predict that the incorporation of boron (B) is favorable to the generation of O-vacancies in transition metal oxides. Then, CoO nanowires with O-vacancies are prepared via incorporation of B using a facile pyrolysis strategy. As evidenced by the combined results of electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy and X-ray absorption near edge structure, O-vacancies in CoO are mainly derived from the disordering of the local structure caused by B doping. DFT calculation results further reveal that the oxidation of *OOH is the rate-limiting step for O-vacancies enriched CoO in the OER and that the presence of O-vacancies can efficiently lower the reaction barrier for breaking Co-O bond, contributing to the improvement of OER kinetics. As expected, the O-vacancies enriched CoO exhibits a low overpotential of 280 mV to reach the current density of 10 mA cm(-2) under basic conditions.									60	4	0	0	1	0	61			1613-6810	1613-6829		WOS:000446998200011	30350550

However, the facile and efficient synthesis method of Fe-based electrocatalysts has been still a big challenge limited by the low conductivity and intrinsic activity. In this work, a facile in-situ electrochemical activation pretreatment technique has been designed to modify the electronic structure and ion ratio (Fe3+/Fe-2(+)) for enhanced catalytic performance using Fe3O4 as precursor. The results for OER performances show that the electro-reduced Fe3O4 (R-Fe3O4) only needs a lower overpotential of 320 mV to reach the density of 10 mA cm(-2) in alkaline medium.

The electrochemical properties of the composite anodes with different coats of the interlayer were measured using anodic polarization, CV, EIS and accelerated life testing. The results showed that the TaOx interlayer was amorphous consisting of multivalent Ta oxides. The electrocatalytic activity for oxygen evolution reaction and the stability of the composite anodes were improved obviously with adding the TaOx interlayer of appropriate thickness, which can be attributed to the increase of electrochemically active sites and the extra protection for Ti substrate by the non-stoichiometric TaOx interlayer.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0013-4651	1945-7111		WOS:000787526100001

Here, an evident enhancement of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is demonstrated on a vanadate-modified iron-nickel catalyst synthesized by a successive ionic layer adsorption and reaction method, which demonstrates ultralow overpotentials of 274 and 310 mV for delivering large current densities of 100 and 400 mA cm(-2), respectively, in 1 mKOH, where vigorous gas bubble evolution occurs. Vanadate modification augments the OER activity by i) increasing the electrochemical surface area and intrinsic activity of the active sites, ii) having an electronic interplay with Fe and Ni catalytic centers, and iii) inducing a high surface wettability and a low-gas bubble-adhesion for accelerated mass transport and gas bubble dissipation at large current densities. Ex situ and operando Raman study reveals the structural evolution of beta-NiOOH and gamma-FeOOH phases during the OER through vanadate-active site synergistic interactions. Operando dynamic specific resistance measurement evidences an accelerated gas bubble dissipation by a significant decrease in the variation of the interfacial resistance during the OER for the vanadate-modified surface. Achievement of a high catalytic turnover of 0.12 s(-1)suggests metallic oxo-anion modification as a versatile catalyst design strategy for advanced water oxidation.									36	1	0	0	3	0	36			1613-6810	1613-6829		WOS:000545531400001	32627936

The high-temperature characteristics of the sintered nickel positive electrodes coated with yttrium hydroxide and calcium hydroxide by immersing them in sodium hydroxide solution after immersing in nitrate solution were greatly enhanced because of the increased oxygen overvoltage.									10	1	0	0	0	0	12			1344-3542	2186-2451		WOS:000184648400004

In this paper, we present a novel free-standing, flexible cathode with needle-like NiCo2O4 coated on a three-dimensional graphene framework. The hierarchical structure exhibits a macropore nest of graphene foam along with mesopore decoration of NiCo2O4 nanorods, which can provide fast diffusion or adsorption for the reactants and abundant active site for the oxygen reduction reaction and oxygen evolution reaction. With the novel cathode, the battery delivers a capacity about 5000 mAhg(-1) at a current density of 400 mAg(-1), and can cycle stably at least 80 times without obvious degradation at the capacity limitation of 1000 mAhg(-1). This flexible cathode shows potential application in foldable electronic devices.									17	1	0	0	0	0	18			2196-0216			WOS:000419269000016

Developing efficient non-precious metal-based electrocatalysts for OER has attracted increasing attention. Herein is reported a strategy to fabricate hierarchical cobalt borate/Ti3C2Tx MXene (Co-B-i/Ti3C2Tx) hybrid through fast chemical reactions at room temperature. This interesting hierarchical structure of Co-B-i/Ti3C2Tx hybrid is beneficial for exposing more active sites, improving mass diffusion, and charge-transfer pathways for electrochemical reaction. Moreover, a strong interaction between Co-B-i and Ti3C2Tx ensures efficient charge transfer and facilitates the electrostatic attraction of more anionic intermediates for a fast redox process. Consequently, the hierarchical Co-B-i/Ti3C2Tx hybrid shows extraordinary OER catalytic activity to deliver a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at an overpotential of 250 mV, and a Tafel slope of about 53 mV dec(-1).									40	1	0	0	0	0	40			1864-5631	1864-564X		WOS:000449952200010	30218551

Possible approaches are the investigation of low-cost, highly active oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalysts and the exploration of alternative anode reactions, such as the electrocatalytic isopropanol oxidation reaction (iPOR) or the glycerol oxidation reaction (GOR), offering the possibility of simultaneously lowering the anodic overpotential and generating value-added products. A suitable class of catalysts are non-noble metal-based perovskites with the general formula ABO(3), featuring rare-earth metal cations at the A- and transition metals at the B-site. We synthesised a series of LaFe1-xCoxO3 materials with x=0-0.70 by automated co-precipitation at constant pH and subsequent calcination at 800 degrees C. X-ray diffraction studies revealed that the phase purity was preserved in samples with x <= 0.3. The activity towards the OER, iPOR, and GOR was investigated by rotating disk electrode voltammetry, showing a relation between structure and metal composition with the activity trends observed for the three reactions. Additionally, GOR product analysis via high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) was conducted after 24 and 48 h electrolysis in a circular flow-through cell setup, pointing out a trade-off between activity and selectivity.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			2196-0216			WOS:000760389500005

Herein, we pioneer demonstrate a new size effect-based controllable synthesis strategy for the homogeneous Co nanokarstcaves assisted by Co-CN hybrids (CCHs). The preferential migration of cobalt atoms on the surface of small size zeolitic imidazolate framework (ZIF) with high surface energy during pyrolysis is the key factor for the formation of nanokarstcave structure. Furthermore, graphene can act as a diffusion barrier to prevent the agglomeration of nanoparticles in the synthesis process, which also plays an important role in the formation of porous nanostructures. In alkali media, CCHs achieve overpotential of 287 mV (@10 mA.cm(-2)) for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and a half wave potential of 0.86 V (vs. RHE) for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR).									8	0	0	0	0	0	8			1998-0124	1998-0000		WOS:000627709600001

However, previous studies have generally either focused on a small number of LDHs, applied synthetic routes with limited structural control, or used non-intrinsic activity metrics, thus hampering the construction of consistent structure-activity-relations. Herein, by employing new individually developed synthesis strategies with atomic structural control, we obtained a broad series of crystalline alpha-M-A(II)M-B(III) LDH and beta-M-A(OH)(2) electrocatalysts (M-A=Ni, Co, and M-B=Co, Fe, Mn). We further derived their intrinsic activity through electrochemical active surface area normalization, yielding the trend NiFe LDH > CoFe LDH > Fe-free Co-containing catalysts > Fe-Co-free Ni-based catalysts. Our theoretical reactivity analysis revealed that these intrinsic activity trends originate from the dual-metal-site nature of the reaction centers, which lead to composition-dependent synergies and diverse scaling relationships that may be used to design catalysts with improved performance.									59	3	0	0	5	0	61			1433-7851	1521-3773		WOS:000654752300001	33844879

A facile solvent method was designed to skillfully integrate the crystal growth process of CoFe2O4, the reduction process of GO and their compound process. In synthesis process, large numbers of defects on GO thin layers were smartly used to disperse CoFe2O4 nanoparticles. The micromorphology and the distribution of as -prepared samples were identified via X-ray diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscope (TEM) and element mapping spectra. Results showed that the monodispersed CoFe2O4 nanoparticles were uniformly coupled with rGO thin layers. Good performance for both oxygen reduction and oxygen evolution of as-prepared CoFe2O4/rGO (0.92 V onset potential for oxygen reduction and 1.59 V overpotential at 10 mA cm(-2) for oxygen evolution, vs. RHE) were found during a series of electrochemical tests, which make it a promising bi-functional catalyst in the field of fuel cells and metal-air batteries.

Structural and morphological characterization has been performed to confirm that the as-synthesized products are cubic NiS2 nanostructures. Interestingly, the as-prepared NiS2 nanostructures exhibit superior electrocatalytic activity towards the oxygen evolution reaction with a small overpotential of 264 mV vs. RHE at 10 mA cm(-2) and a Tafel slope of 105 mV dec(-1). Remarkably, the observed catalytic activity of the NiS2 nanostructures bears close resemblance to that of the benchmark IrO2 catalyst, where IrO2 shows an overpotential of 260 mV with a Tafel slope of 95 mV dec(-1). Thus, the as-synthesized NiS2 nanostructures can be considered as a promising material for the replacement of noble metal-based IrO2 catalysts.									32	1	0	0	2	0	33			2044-4753	2044-4761		WOS:000407636600020

Herein, core-shelled Fe@Ru nanoparticles encapsulated in nitrogen-doped porous dodecahedron carbon (Fe@Ru/NC-x, x denotes the initial Ru mass loading percentage) are employed as efficient catalysts for both HER and ORR. Among all the samples, Fe@Ru/NC-9% exhibits superior bi-functional catalytic performance. Its HER activity is close to the state-of-art Pt/C catalyst in alkalic electrolyte, while it also has markedly outperformed long-term stability compared with Pt/C. Moreover, it has a superior ORR activity and stability, along with stronger methanol tolerance than Pt/C in alkalic electrolyte, while in acidic electrolyte, its ORR activity is in the same level with Pt/C but outperformance is demonstrated in durability measurement and methanol poisoning test. Such remarkable electrocatalytic behaviors could be largely attributable to the distinct Fe@Ru core-shell structure resulted lattice strain in the interface, in conjunction with the synergistic catalytic effects between the core-shell structure and the porous dodecahedron carbon support.

Herein, sea urchin-like NiMoO4 nanorod arrays grown on nickel foam has been developed as a bifunctional electrocatalyst for urea oxidation and hydrogen evolution. The NiMoO4-200/NF catalyst exhibits efficient activity toward hydrogen evolution reaction with a low overpotential of only 68 mV in 1.0 mol/L KOH to gain a current density of 10 mA cm(-2). The NiMoO4-300/NF catalyst exhibits a prominent oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalytic activity with an overpotential of 288 mV at 50 mA cm(-2), as well as for urea oxidation reaction with an ultra-low potential of 1.36 Vat 10 mA cm(-2). The observed difference in electrocatalytic activity and selectivity, derived by temperature variation, is ascribed to different lattice oxygen contents. The lattice oxygen of NiMoO4-300/NF is more than that of NiMoO4-200/NF, and the lattice oxygen is conducive to the progress of OER. A urea electrolyzer was assembled with NiMoO4-200/NF and NiMoO4-300/NF as cathode and anode respectively, delivering a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at a cell voltage of merely 1.38 V.

The molecular interaction between catalytic surfaces and chemical reactants produces a trade-off between catalyst activity and effectiveness, and hence requires optimization. When enhancing electrocatalysis, atomic surface structure tuning is of primary importance in simultaneously meeting demands for electrocatalytic activity and stability. The impact of lattice strain on catalytic activity tuning is experimentally revealed in de-alloyed bimetallic nanoparticles, in which surface distortion makes essential contributions to the activities of state-of-the-art electrocatalysts that vary over distinct sizes, surface defect concentrations, shapes, and atomic compositions under the studied environments. Further, metal-rich shells show compressive strain in core-shell catalyst nanoparticles, yielding shifts in metal electronic band structure features, weakened chemisorption of oxygenated species, and changes in the mechanisms governing catalyst activity. Our study evaluates the practical and fundamental effects of surface distortion and defects on interfacial electrocatalysis, namely in the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), oxygen evolution reaction (OER), and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). This is accomplished via an understanding of strain from theory, establishing reactivity-strain relationships that inform the tuning and enhancement of electrocatalytic activity and stability.									36	0	0	0	1	0	36			1754-5692	1754-5706		WOS:000661183700001

The electrocatalytic activity of the resulting oxide was examined in oxygen evolution reaction (OER) by cyclic voltammetry (CV) and linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) in 1.0 mol L-1 KOH. The NPs displays efficient electrocatalytic activity for oxygen evolution reaction with a current density of 10.0 mA cm(-2) at 1.65 V, good onset potential of 1.52 V vs. RHE and small Tafel slope of 44 mV dec(-1).

However, it is extremely important to uncover the relationship between disorder engineering and catalytic activity. Particularly, deep exploration of the relationship is very important for fabricating excellent highly active catalysts for oxygen evolution reaction (OER), which is one of the promising technologies in energy transition. In this study, we prepared Fe-doped Ni3S2 materials and simultaneously controlled the disorder degree by regulating the ion concentration to improve the activity for OER. By investigating the as-prepared catalysts with various disorder degrees for OER, we also explored the relationship between the disordered structure and OER catalytic performance. In particular, the optimized electrocatalyst with an appropriate disorder degree showed excellent activity and stability. We hope that this study provides a feasible direction to fabricate and optimize transition metal chalcogenide (TMC) electrocatalysts as efficient and stable electrocatalysts for OER.									28	3	0	0	2	0	28			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000459578800026	30663754

We performed an electrochemical evaluation of 14 different perovskites of variable composition and stoichiometry as OER electrocatalysts in alkaline media. We particularly focused on improved methods for a reliable comparison of catalyst activity. From initial electrochemical results we selected the most active samples for further optimization of electrode preparation and testing. An inverted cell configuration facilitated gas bubble detachment and thus minimized blockage of the active surface area. We describe parameters, such as the presence of specific cations, stoichiometry, and conductivity, that are important for obtaining electroactive perovskites for OER. Conductive additives enhanced the current and decreased the apparent overpotential of OER for one of the most active samples (La0.58Sr0.4Fe0.8Co0.2O3).									64	0	0	0	1	0	64			1439-4235	1439-7641		WOS:000341565600024	25044985

Ni-Fe layered double hydroxide (LDH) is considered as one of the most promising non-precious metal electrocatalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Previous research identified the Fe octahedral site surrounded by [NiO6] octahedrons as a highly active and stable site for OER; however, an optimized electrocatalyst material in such a structure is still missing. Herein, reevesite hierarchical nanostructure supported on Ni foam (Reevesite/NF) is constructed to enable the optimal structure toward the OER. Such Reevesite/NF electrocatalysts with a unique ordered intralayer structure are capable of achieving a high current density (300 mA cm(-2)) at a low overpotential of only 283 mV, while the durability of the Reevesite/NF is equally outstanding, offering a promising non-precious metal OER catalyst toward high-efficiency water splitting.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			2196-0216			WOS:000616887800013

Here an active and durable dual catalyst based upon cubic Pt39Ir10Pd11 nanocages with an average edge length of 12.3 nm, porous walls as thin as 1.0 nm, and well-defined {100} facets is reported. The trimetallic nanocages perform better than all the reported dual catalysts in acidic media, with a low ORR-OER overpotential gap of only 704 mV at a Pt-Ir-Pd loading of 16.8 mu g(Pt+Ir+Pd) cm(geo)(-2). For ORR at 0.9 V, when benchmarked against the commercial Pt/C and Pt-Pd nanocages, the trimetallic nanocages exhibit an enhanced mass activity of 0.52 A mg(Pt+Ir+Pd)(-1) (about four and two times as high as those of the Pt/C and Pt-Pd nanocages) and much improved durability. For OER, the trimetallic nanocages show a remarkable mass activity of 0.20 A mg(Pt+Ir)(-1) at 1.53 V, which is 16.7 and 4.3 fold relative to those of the Pt/C and Pt-Pd nanocages, respectively. These improvements can be ascribed to the highly open structure of the nanocages, and the possible electronic coupling between Ir and Pt atoms in the lattice.									60	4	0	0	3	0	60			1614-6832	1614-6840		WOS:000530329400003

The development of high efficiency electrocatalysts has attracted more attention in the field of electrochemistry and photovoltaic cell. Here, a simple cation exchange method is used to prepare the bimetallic sulfides ((CoxM1- x)(9)S-8/M/N-C, M = Ni or Cu) dodecahedral nanocages (DNCs), in which (CoxM1- x)(9)S-8 nanoparticles are coated with N-doped carbon shell. Bimetallic sulfides exhibit enhanced electrocatalytic property for triiodide reduction reaction and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) owing to favorable compositional features and well-designed architectures. The catalytic activities extremely depend on the atom ratio of Co:M and the component. Remarkably, (Co0.75Ni0.25)(9)S-8/N-C DNCs deliver the best electrocatalytic activity for the triiodide reduction reaction using as the low-cost Pt-free counter electrode (CE) in dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs). Furthermore, (Co0.64Ni0.36)(9)S-8/Ni/N-C-1 DNCs as an OER catalyst exhibit excellent electrocatalytic property in the light of the low overpotential (326 mV) at the current density of 10 mA cm(-2). This notion and expedient method of construction can be broadened to synthesize other bimetallic sulfides with preferable electrocatalytic performance. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Here we report the rational design of hollow Mo-doped CoP (Mo-CoP) nanoarrays, which simultaneously combine electronic structure modification through doping with a high density of reaction sites through nanostructuring. With this strategy the Mo-CoP arrays give significantly improved hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) performance, and also, when in situ transformed into Mo-doped CoOOH (Mo-CoOOH) arrays, excellent activity towards the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is obtained. The origin of the improvement is determined by atomic-resolution imaging combined with density functional theory (DFT). An electrolyzer using Mo-CoP and Mo-CoOOH can be powered by a single AA battery (similar to 1.5 V), and maintains a stable water-splitting current for 20 h, superior to most reported electrocatalysts in alkaline media, offering great promise for practical applications.									465	29	0	0	21	0	470			2211-2855	2211-3282		WOS:000432604600009

Therefore, the development of bifunctional catalysts for OER and ORR is of great importance to enhance the performance of these devices. Herein, we present a Pr/Ba cation-disordered perovskite Pr2/3Ba1/3CoO3-delta, as a novel bifunctional catalyst for OER and ORR. Here delta is the content of oxygen vacancies. Rietveld refinement of the X-ray powder diffraction data of Pr2/3Ba1/3CoO2.98 was successfully performed by a single phase with an orthorhombic Pnma Pr/Ba cation-disordered perovskite-type structure. The bond valence sum of Co cation, 3.11 and thermogravimetric measurements suggested the coexistence of Co3+, Co4+, Pr3+ and Pr4+ cations in the bulk Pr2/3Ba1/3CoO2.98. The X-ray photoemission spectroscopy of Pr2/3Ba1/3CoO2.98 indicated the coexistence of these four cations at the sample surface, which would improve the electrocatalysis. The electrical conductivity sigma of Pr/Ba cation-disordered perovskite Pr2/3Ba1/3CoO3-delta was higher than that of Pr/Ba cation-ordered layered perovskite PrBaCo2O6-delta. The sigma of Pr2/3Ba1/3CoO3-delta and PrBaCo2O6-delta decreased with an increase of temperature. The concentration of oxygen vacancies delta of Pr2/3Ba1/3CoO3-delta increased with increasing temperature. Electrochemical measurements of the Pr/Ba cation-disordered perovskite Pr2/3Ba1/3CoO2.98 indicated higher OER and ORR catalytic activities, compared to the Pr/Ba cation-ordered layered perovskite PrBaCo2O6-delta. The Pr2/3Ba1/3CoO2.98 exhibited higher bifunctional electrocatalytic activities compared with many bifunctional catalysts in the literature. These results highlight the Pr/Ba cation-disordered perovskite-type Pr2/3Ba1/3CoO3-delta as a promising bifunctional catalyst for renewable energy applications. (C) 2018 The Ceramic Society of Japan.

In the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), surface oxygen adsorption plays an indispensable role in the electrocatalysis. The relationship between the adsorption energetics and OER kinetics, however, has not yet been experimentally measured. Herein we report an experimental relationship between the adsorption of surface oxygen and the kinetics of the OER on IrO2(110) epitaxially grown on a TiO2(110) single crystal. The high quality of the IrO2 film grown using molecular-beam epitaxy affords the ability to extract the surface oxygen adsorption and its impact on the OER. By examining a series of electrolytes, we find that the adsorption energy changes linearly with pH, which we attribute to the electrified interfacial water. We support this hypothesis by showing that an electrolyte salt modification can lead to an adsorption energy shift. The dependence of the adsorption energy on pH has implications for the OER kinetics, but it is not the only factor; the dependence of the OER electrocatalysis on pH stipulates two OER mechanisms, one operating in acidic solution and another operating in alkaline solution. Our work points to the subtle adsorption kinetics relationship in the OER and highlights the importance of the interfacial electrified interaction in electrocatalyst design.									196	5	0	0	13	0	196			0002-7863	1520-5126		WOS:000396185700027	28181433

Based on cost, corrosion stability and over-potential, nickel is an advantageous material for the anode in alkaline water electrolysis. However, the use of this metal is associated with two main difficulties: the progressive deactivation of the anode occurs at higher potentials, presumably due to the modification of the active nickel species into inactive ones, and the potential becomes unavoidably increasingly positive over time, thus decreasing the efficiency of the electrode. Nickel-based bimetallic catalysts, such as Ni-Ir, Ni-Co, Ni-Mn, Ni-Fe, usually obtained by electrodeposition, have been widely studied in recent years in the search for catalysts that improve the activity of nickel towards the OER. However, polymeric films were used by several researchers to incorporate various metal complexes, with an aim of improving the activity and stability of electrodes surfaces. Modified electrodes obtained by these polymeric films are characterized by good ionic conductivity and permeability. These as well, we conducted a study of the oxygen evolution reaction in the basic medium on electrodes modified by polymerization of aniline and electrodeposition of (Nickel-Cobalt) bimetallic. In the present work, the electrodeposition technique has been adopted to introduce different amounts of cobalt into the nickel. Surface morphologies of the electrodeposits and their electrocatalytic properties have been studied for the oxygen evolution reaction in NaOH solutions. The Ni-Co bimetallic film is much more reactive than Ni for the OER. Co has a significant effect on the OER. The effect of Co deposited with NiO film depends on its content.

X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy proves the strong interactions between Mo2C and CoMoS4 and the Raman analysis certifies the presence of richened defects in Mo2C/CoMoS4. Moreover, the Mo2C/CoMoS4 possesses a long-term catalytic stability, showing potential application in the water splitting.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			1862-6300	1862-6319		WOS:000706620300001

Passivation and corrosion phenomena were investigated by cyclic voltammetry, electrochemical impedance spectra, linear sweep voltammetry. The effect of bismuth on oxygen evolution and hydrogen evolution were also discussed. The experimental results show that the addition of bismuth leads to the decreases of the hydrogen overpotential and increase of the hydrogen evolution rate. Oxygen evolution rate increases with the increase of content of bismuth. The measurements of cyclic voltarnmetry suggested that bismuth may promote the formation of lead dioxide. A key result was that the presence of bismuth might have beneficial effect on the formation of Pb(II). (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.

In the stoichiometric and bulk form, however, the oxide is extremely inactive. Here, we explored the effects of electrochemical reduction treatment on the physical and electrochemical properties of TaOx. The oxide was electrochemically deposited on a glassy carbon electrode. The treatment employed a cyclic voltammetry technique in sulfuric acid solution and required no heat treatment. The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements demonstrated that the stoichiometric Ta2O5 is reduced generating the oxides with a predominant oxidation state of 4+. Remarkably, the electrochemically reduced TaOx showed high activity in hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). These findings suggest that the electrochemically reductive treatment is an effective way to activate TaOx for the electrocatalytic reactions which could be originated from the suboxide species, i.e., Ta4+.									26	0	0	0	1	0	26			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000359184200050

Herein, interpenetrated porous 3D-networked iron-nickel sulfide nanosheets are synthesized on nickel foam (NF) (donated as FeS-Ni3S2/NF) via partial chemical etching of Ni(OH)(2)/NF precursor with Fe(CN)(6)(3-), followed by chemical etching/anion exchanging of Fe(CN)(6)(3-) and OH- with S2-. The resulting FeS-Ni3S2/NF nanosheets possess a remarkable catalytic activity for the OER with overpotentials of only 238 and 290 mV at 10 and 100 mA cm(-2), respectively, much lower than Ni3S2/NF. Furthermore, the catalyst exhibits the low Tafel slope (44 mV dec(-1)) and outstanding OER stability. This work provides a simple way for fabricating highly efficient electrocatalysts toward OER.									13	0	0	0	1	0	13			2196-7350			WOS:000479359600001

As an electrocatalyst in the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), CoOx/FeOx/CNTs showed excellent electrocatalytic performance in terms of catalytic activity and stability. The overpotential of CoOx/FeOx/CNTs in OER was only 308 mV at 10 mA cm(-2), which was lower than those of the pure oxides: CoOx/CNTs (392 mV) and FeOx/CNTs (406 mV). The as-prepared electrocatalyst also displayed better stability than the reference RuO(2)material, with almost no attenuation of current density in contrast to the 10% loss seen with RuO2. The OER performance of CoOx/FeOx/CNTs was superior to those of its oxide components due to the formation of heterojunction, which led to a smoother reaction path and a lower overpotential for OER compared to pure oxides, as supported by the density-functional theory (DFT) calculations. These results provide a new direction for the preparation of electrocatalysts for metal-air batteries and water splitting reactions.									12	0	0	0	0	0	12			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000555361700026

Herein, vertically aligned CoTe and NiTe nanoarrays are synthesized in situ grown on Ni foams (marked as CoTeNR/NF and NiTeNR/NF) via a facile hydrothermal method, and further explore their catalytic activities for overall water splitting. The CoTeNR/NF catalyst exhibits not only excellent OER performance with a low overpotential of 350 mV to deliver 100 mA cm(-2), but also high HER activity only requiring 202 mV overpotential to yield 10 mA cm(-2) in alkaline condition. Moreover, experimental technique and density functional theory are combined together to reveal that the real active sites of CoTeNR/NF for OER are from the in situ generated CoOOHspecies on CoTeNR/NF in the OER process, and also propose a new HER performance evaluation criteria of using H2O adsorption energy, H2O dissociation barrier, and H-2/OH- desorption energy as an indicator. The new criteria can satisfactorily evaluate the HER performance of as-synthesized samples, while the traditional one of using H adsorption energy as an indicator fails in the HER performance evaluation of as-synthesized samples. It is expected that the new evaluation criteria can be used as a general criteria to evaluate the HER performance of other electrocatalysts.									68	2	0	0	1	0	68			2366-9608			WOS:000471814300020

Water electrolyzers could use renewable energies such as solar and wind to produce hydrogen. However, the sluggish oxygen evolution reaction (OER) at the anode is the bottleneck in the whole water splitting process. Noble metal Ir and Ru oxides are benchmark OER catalysts with high performance. However, the scarcity and high price limit their large-scale applications. Currently, abundant transition metal oxides have been intensively investigated as potential OER catalysts. In this article, we provide a general comparison between different types of first-row transition metal oxides, including Mn, Fe, Co, and Ni for OER in alkaline, acidic and neutral electrolytes, and the regulation strategies for enhancing their OER performance. Recent in situ spectroscopic studies are also introduced to understand the OER reaction mechanism based on the structure-activity relationship. Finally, this review ends with challenges and perspectives for the development of future OER electrocatalysts.									38	2	0	0	1	0	39			2398-4902			WOS:000582936800002

Herein, we in-situ craft ultrathin CoNi-sulfides nanosheet (similar to 2.2 nm in thickness) arrays-anchored MnO2 nanoparticles (similar to 3.2 nm in diameter) (denoted U-CoNi-S-NSA/MnO2) via a spontaneous redox process between CoNi-sulfides nanosheet and MnO4- anions at ambient temperature. The hierarchical U-CoNi-S-NSA/MnO2 nanocomposites are then directly employed as self-supported catalysts for the two half reactions of water splitting, showing excellent activity with small overpotentials of 170 mV for oxygen evolution reaction and 67 mV for hydrogen evolution reaction to achieve 10 mA cm(-2), respectively. Moreover, an efficient water electrolyzer through using U-CoNi-S-NSA/MnO2 as both anodic and cathodic catalysts is fabricated, which achieves current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at a small voltage of 1.51 V over a long-time operation of 20 h. This outstanding performance is markedly superior than that of precious Pt/C//RuO2 counterpart (1.61 V). Therefore, the as-synthesized hierarchical nano composites are promising candidates for cheap and efficient water splitting.									30	1	0	0	0	0	30			0378-7753	1873-2755		WOS:000442056800019

Perovskite oxides are extensively studied as OER catalysts as they can have high activity and also offer considerable flexibility in composition and structure. Recently, there are increasingly numerous reports regarding dynamic surface reconstruction of perovskite oxides under OER conditions, with claims that the reconstruction-derived species are the actual catalysts responsible for the measured OER activity. To enable rational design of perovskite oxides as precatalysts to generate actual active components in situ, gaining essential understanding of their reconstruction behaviors is crucial. This perspective discusses the roles of initial bulk chemistry in the surface evolution process of perovskite oxides during OER, including the dependency of surface stability on electronic structure of the precatalyst and the possibility of occurrence of lattice oxygen evolution reaction and cation leaching on the surface of a perovskite oxide precatalyst. It is reasonably argued that tailoring the bulk properties of perovskite precatalysts, such as electronic structure, crystallographic structure, and ion stoichiometry, can influence the occurrence of surface reconstruction and the formation of actual active surface species.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			2688-4046			WOS:000844282800002

Water electrolysis consists of two half-reactions, of which the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is the major source of energy loss. In the case of the alkaline water electrolysis, the spectrum of materials that are stable under the conditions of the OER is significantly broader than in the case of an acidic route. This review compares systematically different materials classes based on reported overpotential at current density 10 mA cm(-2). Plethora of studies was gathered to accomplish this task and the OER catalysts reported in the literature to date are summarized. In addition, we have provided an insight into the catalyst activity descriptors allowing theoretical identification of the most active materials. In order to assist the reader in gaining a better understanding of this complex subject, the catalysts are classified into three main groups in agreement with their chemical composition as transition metal oxides, phosphides and selenides. Less frequently used materials are reported in a separate group. Near-neutral or neutral pH conditions are considered as well.									21	0	0	0	0	0	21			0378-7753	1873-2755		WOS:000684973400002

This paper presents an efficient and universal process to enhance the interfacial interaction between SS and highly active electrocatalysts for the preparation of 3D electrodes through the formation of an interfacial network of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) on the SS. Nanoscale X-ray computed tomography and focused ion beam are used to visualize the interface between CNTs and SS, and 3D structure of CNT/SS electrodes. The strongly interconnected CNTs network increases the surface area of the SS support that benefits the modification of highly active electrocatalysts and also serves as an electron/charge-conductive highway between electrocatalysts and support. The electrocatalysts on CNT/SS further improve hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) performances, respectively, of the 3D electrodes. While compared to the SS-based electrodes reported recently, Pt/OxCNT/SS shows the best HER activity over wide pH range and RuO2/OxCNT/SS exhibits a comparable OER performance in neutral and alkaline electrolyte. An efficient approach is reported to combine highly active electrocatalysts with SS for the preparation of active and stable 3D electrodes that can be further explored in various areas.									12	0	0	0	1	0	12			2196-7350			WOS:000477259800001

Herein, the bimetal FeCo nanoarrays enclosed N-CNTs have a high surface on carbon cloth support, which promotes efficient electron transport and prevents nanoparticle aggregation. Taking advantage of the high-level use of active material and fast charge transfer, the developed electrocatalyst exhibits excellent multifunctional electrocatalyst such as oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), oxygen evolution reaction (OER), and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). The N-CNTs@MOF FeCo nanoarrays @CC exhibit higher activity than reference catalysts including MOF FeCo nanoarrays@CC, FeCo nanoarrays@CC, and CC. Interestingly, the synthesized multifunctional catalyst, which serves as the air electrode in zinc-air batteries with liquid electrolytes as well as solid-state gel electrolytes possesses outstanding charging-discharge performance and long service life.

While the chemical and structural transformation occurring during electrolysis at the electrolyte-catalyst interface is now regarded as a crucial factor influencing OER activity, here, using La0.7Sr0.3CoO3-delta (LSCO) as an active OER catalyst, the critical influence of buried layers on the oxidation current stability in nanoscopically thin, chemically and structurally evolving, catalyst layers is revealed. The use of epitaxial thin films is demonstrated to engineer both depletion layer widths and chemical stability of the catalyst support structure resulting in heterostructured anodes that maintain facile transport kinetics across the electrolyte-anode interface for atomically thin (2-3 unit cells) LSCO catalyst layers and greatly enhanced oxidation current stability as the perovskite structure OER catalysts chemically and structurally transform. This work opens up an approach to design robust and active heterostructured anodes with dynamically evolving ultrathin OER electrocatalyst layers for future green fuel technologies such as conformal coatings of high-density 3D anode topologies for water splitting.									14	0	0	0	0	0	13			1614-6832	1614-6840		WOS:000477664700002

Here, we show that metal alloy-based hybrids can provide higher electrocatalytic activity than their individual metal-based hybrids. In particular, NiCo alloys encapsulated within nitrogen-doped carbon nanotubes (NiCo@NCNTs) showed higher OER activities in an alkaline solution than the individual metal hybrids (Ni@NCNTs and Co@NCNTs), highlighting a synergy between the Ni and Co components. NiCo@NCNTs pyrolyzed at 800 degrees C displayed an overpotential of similar to 41 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) and were more stable than IrO2 during 1000-cycle accelerated durability testing at a scan rate of 100 mV s(-1).

This review concerns the progress and new discoveries in the field of Ni/Fe-based micro/nanostructures toward electrochemical and photo-electrochemical (PEC) water oxidation during last few years. First, toward the design and construction of new electrocatalysis, different types of current Ni/Fe-based compounds for OER are summarized. The mechanism studies of the active phases and positions of Ni/Fe-based micro/nanostructures are further introduced to understand the properties of catalytic active sites, which could facilitate further improving the performance of Ni/Fe-based OER electrocatalysts. Second, splitting water using sunlight with low overpotential is another important target in making solar-to-hydrogen micro/nanodevices, and thus attention is then focused on the development of several important Ni/Fe-based PEC catalysts. Third, the recent theoretical calculations on the OER mechanism during water splitting and insights into electronic structures are analyzed; finally, the future trends and perspectives are also discussed briefly.									245	17	0	0	21	0	247			1614-6832	1614-6840		WOS:000521114800014

The effect of the ratio of Cu2+/Co3+ and the degree of oxidation during the co-precipitation and annealing steps on the crystal structure, morphology, and electrocatalytic properties of the produced CCO NPs were studied. The CCO1:2 electrode exhibited an outstanding performance and high stability owing to the suitable electrochemical kinetics, which was provided by the presence of sufficient Co3+ as active sites for oxygen evolution and the uniform sizes of the NPs in the half cell. Furthermore, single cell tests were performed to confirm the possibility of using the synthesized electrocatalyst in a practical water splitting system. The CCO1:2 electrocatalyst was used as an anode to develop an anion exchange membrane water electrolyzer (AEMWE) cell. The full cell showed stable hydrogen production for 100 h with an energetic efficiency of >71%. In addition, it was possible to mass produce the uniform, highly active electrocatalyst for such applications through the co-precipitation method.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			2296-2646			WOS:000589963200001	33344420

The catalyst was fabricated by a one-pot coprecipitation method at room temperature, and its turnover frequency (TOF) is more than 20 times higher than the TOFs of Co and Mn oxides and hydroxides, and 9 times higher than the TOF of a precious IrO2 catalyst. The activity of the catalyst was promoted by anodic conditioning, which was proposed to form amorphous regions and reactive Co(IV) species on the surface.

Herein we report the designed construction of novel CoS2 nanoboxes by employing the Co-based zeolitic imidazolate (ZIF-67) nanocubes (NCs) as the starting template. Delicate manipulation of the template-engaged reaction time between thioacetamide (TAA) and ZIF-67 NCs leads to the formation of hollow CoS2 nanostructures. As a result of the unique nanobox structure, the optimized CoS2 nanoboxes (NBs) have an enlarged electrolyte-accessible surface, abundant mass diffusion pathways, and high structural integrity, which afford the current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at a low overpotential of 290 mV for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in 1 M KOH solution. Remarkably, these CoS2 NBs could also display excellent long-term stability for more than 40 h electrochemical test in an alkaline medium, showing a class of advanced electrocatalysts for OER and beyond.

In this study, we demonstrated sandwich-like Co (OH)(x)/Ag/Co(OH)(2) nanosheet composites as efficient OER electrocatalysts in alkaline media. The composites were fabricated on carbon paper (CP) through Ag galvanic displacement on the as-electrodeposited Co(OH)(2) nanosheet layer and subsequent electrodeposition of the second Co(OH)(2) nanosheet layer. Benefiting from the introduction of Ag particles and the unique sandwich structure, the resulting composites exhibited excellent OER activity with the overpotential of 283 mV at the current density of 10 mA/cm(2) and Tafel slope of 97 mV/dec in a 1.0 M KOH.

Commercial micro-scaled Ebonex (Altraverda, UK) was mechanically treated for 4, 8, 12, 16 and 20 h and further Co metallic phase was grafted by sol-gel method. Morphology of Co/Ebonex electrocatalysts was observed by means of TEM and SEM microscopy, while electrochemical behavior by means of cyclic voltammetry and steady-state galvanostatic method.As the duration of mechanical treatment increases, the size of Magneli phases decreases, and consequently catalytic activity of the corresponding electrocatalysts increases. Structural characteristics of the electrocatalysts deposited on Ebonex treated for 16 and 20 h are very similar. Also, these electrocatalysts show similar electrocatalytic activity for both hydrogen and oxygen evolution reaction. So, optimal duration of mechanical treatment of Magneli phases is in the range of 16-20 h.Catalytic activity for hydrogen evolution of the studied electrocatalysts is inferior related to the corresponding catalysts deposited on carbonaceous support materials such as activated multiwalled carbon nanotubes or Vulcan XC-72 + TiO2 (anatase). This inferiority is due to lower real surface area of the Magneli phases.Catalytic behavior for oxygen evolution achieves its maximal value even at the catalyst deposited on Ebonex treated for 12 h and it is very promising related to the similar electrocatalytic system such as CoPt/Ebonex.

J	Bisen, Omeshwari Yadorao; Yadav, Ashok Kumar; Pavithra, B.; Nanda, Karuna Kar								Electronic structure modulation of molybdenum-iron double-atom catalyst for bifunctional oxygen electrochemistry								CHEMICAL ENGINEERING JOURNAL				449						137705	10.1016/j.cej.2022.137705				DEC 1 2022	2022	Exploration of cost effective and high performance electrocatalysts for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is becoming the paramount interest towards the emerging renewable energy technologies such as fuel cells, metal air-batteries and water electrolysers, etc. One of such catalysts is single atom catalyst that exhibits well defined active sites with very high atom utilization efficiency but selective mainly towards ORR. We demonstrate one-step synthesis of carbon-nitrogen (CN)-coordinated Fe-Mo double atom catalyst with high atom utilization efficiency towards both ORR and OER. The catalyst exhibits enhanced activity with lower overpotential associated with ORR and OER (Delta E = Ej=10(OER) - E1/2(ORR)) and better mass activity in comparison to that of Mo-N-C and Fe-N-C, even better than the state-of-the-art Pt/C and RuO2 catalysts for ORR and OER, respectively. This place the double atom catalysts in the series of non-precious metal based bifunctional catalysts for overall oxygen electrochemistry and is due to the electronic structure modification around the metal atoms induced by other neighbouring metal atom. The double atom Fe-Mo-N-C exhibits a remarkable and highly durable ORR performance with suppressed peroxide generation due to the muted outer sphere electron transfer mechanism in comparison with the commercially available state-of-the-art Pt/C electrocatalyst. Moreover, Fe-Mo-N-C shows remarkable enhanced overall oxygen electrochemistry at higher temperature (323 K - a temperature 25 K above the room temperature), widening its applicability. Overall, this work paves the way to design multi-atom catalysts towards multi-functional electrocatalytic activities.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000828003300001

Herein, we report a Co/Co9S8 composite catalyst, which is coupled with reduced graphene oxide (rGO) and multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) via a combined hydrothermal reaction with a calcination method. Benefiting from the unique porous scaffold structures and synergistic interactions between rGO/MWCNT and Co/Co9S8, the electrocatalyst (Co/Co9S8/rGO/MWCNT-800) exhibits high electrochemical activity for the ORR, showing a four-electron oxygen reduction pathway with an onset potential of 0.946 V (vs. RHE) in alkaline medium. Meanwhile, the electrocatalyst shows high electrochemical stability, excellent selectivity and methanol tolerance over the commercial Pt/C. It also exhibits good overall oxygen electrode activity (Delta E = E-OER,E- 10-E-ORR,E- 1/2 of 890 mV). The present work highlights a potential general strategy for developing carbon-based transition metal sulfide nanocomposites as cathodes with better performance in the ORR/OER.									12	1	0	0	0	0	12			2052-1553			WOS:000491293500037

However, to implement this strategy, one of the major challenges, the sluggish kinetics of the paired oxygen evolution reaction (OER) at anode, needs to be surmounted. It is therefore highly desirable to explore high-performance and cost-effective OER electrocatalysts suitable for CO2RR conditions, which is very different from those widely investigated under acidic or alkaline conditions. In this review, the ongoing development of OER electrocatalysts under near pH-neutral CO2-saturated (bi)carbonate solutions are highlighted and the future opportunities are discussed. It is started with a brief introduction on OER paired with CO2RR, the relevant theoretical tools such as density functional theory (DFT) and particularly machine learning (ML), and the operando characterization techniques. Then, there are some detailed discussions of recent progress on the rational design of OER electrocatalysts under CO2RR conditions ranging from noble-metal oxides to nonprecious metal phosphides, carbonates, (hydro)oxides, and so on. Finally, a perspective for developing OER electrocatalysts integrated with CO2 electroreduction is proposed.									7	0	0	0	0	0	7			0935-9648	1521-4095		WOS:000707801400001	34658063

The structural, morphological and surface area studies of the synthesized nanoparticles were conducted with X-ray diffraction, electron microscopy and BETsurface area studies. The bifunctional electrocatalytic performance of RuO2 nanoparticles was studied under different atmospheric conditions for OER and ORR, respectively, versus reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) in alkaline medium. Low Tafel slopes of RuO2 nanoparticles were found to be similar to 47 and similar to 49 mV/dec for OER and ORR, respectively, in oxygen saturated 0.5 M KOH system. Moreover, the catalytic activity of RuO2 nanoparticles was examined against the Horseradish peroxidase enzyme (HRP) at high temperature, and the nanoparticles were applied as a sensor for the detection of H2O2 in the solution.									10	0	0	0	0	0	10				2073-4344		WOS:000554163500001

Here, we develop a high performance and stable electrocatalyst for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) using earth abundant materials. A binder free approach for the synthesis of flower-shaped cobalt oxide (Co3O4) composed of nanosheets showed high OER catalytic activity. The Co3O4 electrode requires a low overpotential of 356 mV to achieve a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) with a low onset potential of 284 mV. The electrode showed outstanding flexibility and stability. The catalytic activity of the Co3O4 electrode was very stable up to the 2000th cycle of the polarization study. The high catalytic activity and structural stability arise due to efficient and fast charge transportation through the nanosheets of Co3O4 which are in direct contact with the conducting nickel of the electrode. The porous structure of Co3O4 allows easy access of the electrolyte and escape of generated oxygen without damaging the structure. Collectively, the flower-shaped nanostructured Co3O4 electrode can be used as a flexible and high performance electrode for the OER in an industrial setup.									48	1	0	0	1	0	48				2052-1537		WOS:000412455200013

Beyond the typical doping strategy that suffers from synthesis difficulties and concentration limitations, the innovative introduction of rare-earth is highly desired. Herein, a novel synthesis strategy is presented by introducing CeO2 support for the nickel-iron-chromium hydroxide (NFC) to boost the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) performance, which achieves an ultralow overpotential at 10 mA cm(-2) of 230.8 mV, the Tafel slope of 32.7 mV dec(-1), as well as the excellent durability in alkaline solution. Density functional theory calculations prove the established d-f electronic ladders, by the interaction between NFC and CeO2, evidently boosts the high-speed electron transfer. Meanwhile, the stable valence state in CeO2 preserves the high electronic reactivity for OER.

The product is characterized by powder X-ray diffraction analysis, Raman spectroscopy, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy, energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, and elemental mapping, which support the formation of proposed composite materials. The oxygen evolution reaction activity of MnO2@MOF-5 composite is evaluated by cyclic voltammetry, linear sweep voltammetry, and chronoamperometric measurement under visible light. It is found that MnO2@MOF-5/NF has better durability and ability to produce a current density of 10 mAcm(-2) at only 324 mV overpotential with lower 71 mVdec(-1) Tafel slope as compared to some of previously reported Mn-based catalysts for oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The stability of these electrodes is evaluated by chronoamperometric studies for 6000 s in the presence of visible light, and they showed constant current density. Furthermore, the stability studied by continuous CV sweeps in 1.0 M NaOH at a scan rate of 100 mVs(-1) shows that these materials are stable up to 100 cycles, which confirms the stability and durability of the electrodes.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			0947-7047	1862-0760		WOS:000629129100001

This double-exchange is realized through electronic interaction between transition metal ions and foreign dopants in a transition metal oxide. Based on systematical evaluation on dopants with varied d-electron numbers, we demonstrate that the d electron-poor dopant exhibits more significant double-exchange interaction with the transition metal ions, and therefore obtains more active high-valence metal sites, and thus achieves better neutral OER performance.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			1359-7345	1364-548X		WOS:000596710700010	33185208

Herein, we report the first scalable preparation of a porous nickel-foam-templated superstructure of carbon nanosheets decorated with ultrafine cobalt phosphide nanoparticles. Uniform two-dimensional (2D) Co-metal organic framework (MOF) nanosheets (Co-MNS) grow on nickel foam, followed by a MOF-mediated tandem (carbonization/phosphidation) pyrolysis. The resulting superstructure has a porous 3D interconnected network with well-arranged 2D carbon nanosheets on it, in which ultrafine cobalt phosphide nanoparticles are tightly immobilized. A single piece of this superstructure can be directly used as a self-supported electrode for electrocatalysis without any binders. This "one-piece" porous superstructure with excellent mass transport and electron transport properties, and catalytically active cobalt phosphide nanoparticles with ultrasmall size (3-4 nm), shows excellent trifunctional electrocatalytic activities for oxygen evolution reaction (OER), hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), achieving great performances in water splitting and Zn-air batteries.									105	8	0	0	5	0	105			1433-7851	1521-3773		WOS:000575551800001	32897613

In this work, sub-nm Pt nanoclusters (NCs) on defective NiFe layered double hydroxide nanosheets (NixFe LDHs) are synthesized by a facile electrodeposition method. Due to the synergistic effect between Pt NCs and abundant atomic M(II) defects, along with hierarchical porous nanostructures, the Pt/NixFe LDHs catalysts exhibit superior trifunctional electrocatalytic activity and durability toward the HER/OER/ORR. A WAE fabricated with Pt/NixFe LDHs electrodes needs 1.47 V to reach a current density of 10 mA cm(-2), much lower than that of the mixed 20% Pt/C and 20% Ir/C catalysts. An HSAB assembled by Pt/NixFe LDHs as a binder-free air cathode displays a high open-circuit voltage, a narrow overpotential gap, and remarkable rechargeability. This work provides a feasible strategy for constructing freestanding efficient trifunctional electrocatalysts for sustainable energy conversion and storage systems.									11	0	0	0	1	0	11			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000664289800022	34096268

Using a novel cyclotetramerization, a task-specific bimetallic phthalocyanine-based nanoporous organic framework is successfully built as a precursor for the carbonization synthesis of a nonprecious OER electrocatalyst. The resultant material exhibits an excellent OER activity with a low overpotential of 280 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) and high durability in an alkaline medium. This impressive result ranks among the best from known Co-based OER catalysts under the same conditions. The simultaneous installation of multiple diverse cobalt-based active sites, including FeCo alloys and Co4N nanoparticles, plays a critical role in achieving this promising OER performance. This innovative approach not only enables high-performance OER activity to be achieved but simultaneously provides a means to control the surface features, thereby tuning the catalytic property of the material.									136	4	0	0	3	0	136			0935-9648	1521-4095		WOS:000418068700018	29068542

The synthesized complex anion has been characterized spectroscopically and by single-crystal X-ray diffraction, while its composites with GO, rGO and g-C3N4 have been characterized using physicochemical characterization techniques, viz. powder X-ray diffraction and scanning electron microscopy. Electrochemical measurements were performed on a three-electrode system having a platinum wire counter electrode, a Ag/AgCl reference electrode and a catalytically modified glassy carbon electrode using linear sweep voltammetry, cyclic voltammetry and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. The electrochemical studies suggest that the [Ni(S2C2Ph2)(2)]-rGO modified electrode had notable electrocatalytic activity for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The fabricated electrode exhibited acceptable repeatability, reproducibility and stability.

The formed tubular nanostructure, chemical composition, and the elemental distribution are analyzed using TEM, BET, FTIR, XRD, and XPS. The electrocatalytic activity towards oxygen evolution reactions and photodegradation against Rhodamine B are investigated. It has been found out that the oxygen evolutions starts at 0.8 V and reaches 0.98 mA.cm-1 at 1.4 V vs. SCE. For photodegradation of Rhodamine B, the concentration decreased to 24% after 1 h irradiation using the sample with a mass percentage of 5% cobalt. The results demonstrate that the cobalt oxide doped titanate nanotubes are good candidates as electrocatalysts and photocatalytic materials.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			1007-1202			INSPEC:17142657

Nanocrystalline Ni-Fe alloy coatings were deposited on copper electrode from acidic bath, at different cathode current densities (c.d). Coatings were tested for their electro-catalytic behaviours, namely for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in 6 M KOH by cyclic voltammetry and chrono-potentiometry techniques. Experimental results demonstrated that these coatings can be used as potential material for water electrolysis. The corrosion stability of these coatings has also been tested in their working conditions (6 M KOH) by DC polarization method. The deposition conditions of Ni-Fe alloy were optimized for peak performance for both electro-catalytic reactions and corrosion stability. Ni-Fe alloy coatings deposited towards low and high c.d limits were found to be the better materials for OER and HER, respectively from same electrolytic solution. Further, Ni-Fe coating deposited at 6.0 Ad m(-2) was found to be the most corrosion resistant. The structure-property relationship of electrodeposited coatings has been discussed by exploring PXRD, EDX and FESEM study. Copyright (C) 2014, Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC.

Super activity to the state-of-the-art Pt and RuO2 is found for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) because of the high degree of crystallinity, uniform distribution of nanoparticles, and electronic effect in the catalyst system. It offers a low cell voltage of 1.57 V to drive 10 mA cm(-2), 100 mV lower than that of Pt/C-RuO2 benchmark electrodes in an alkaline electrolyte, along with a pretty good chemical and structural stability in the strong corrosive environment. The theory calculation confirms the superior intermediates adsorption property because of the Ru/Te synergism, and Pt like/RuO2 like character for water splitting reaction. It is a very promising catalyst in the alkaline electrolyzer due to the reliable catalytic ability and relatively low price (1/4 Pt).									89	3	0	0	7	0	89			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000564571400002

Here, a rocksalt-type high-entropy oxide Mg0.2Co0.2Ni0.2Cu0.2Zn0.2O (HEO) is developed as an electrocatalyst towards the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The obtained HEO features abundant cation and oxygen vacancies originating from the lattice mismatch of neighboring metal ions, together with enlarged Co/Ni-O covalency due to the introduction of less electronegative Mg and Zn. As a result, the HEO exhibits superior intrinsic OER activities, delivering a turnover frequency (TOF) 15 and 84 folds that of CoO and NiO at 1.65 V, respectively. This study provides a mechanistic understanding of the enhanced OER on HEO and demonstrates the potential of high-entropy strategy in developing efficient oxygen electrocatalysts by elaborately incorporating low-cost elements with lower electro negativity.

Herein, a new and promising electrocatalytic material, ternary CoIn2S4 thiospinel, is demonstrated for effectively catalyzing oxygen reduction and oxygen evolution reactions (ORR and OER) with S-doped reduced graphene oxide (S-rGO) as an electronic conductor. Compared with Co9S8/S-rGO (without In doping), the newly developed CoIn2S4/S-rGO reveals superior electrocatalytic properties for the ORR (half-wave potential of 0.83 V) and OER (overpotential of 0.37 V at 10 mA cm(-2)), demonstrating that the introduction of In can promote the reversible oxygen electrode reactions of CoIn2S4. The superior experimentally- observed electrocatalytic properties are corroborated via density function theory investigations. Meanwhile, the synergistic improvements in the bifunctional activities resulting from the combination of CoIn2S4 and S-rGO are also confirmed. As a proof of concept, home-made Zn-air cells are assembled with CoIn2S4/S-rGO as an air-cathode. The developed Zn-air cells exhibit a high peak power density (133 mW cm(-2)) with an energy density of 951 Wh kgZn(-1) and robust cycling stability over 150 cycles for 50 h, exceeding of those commercial Pt/C+ RuO2 which highlights the practical viability of CoIn2S4/S-rGO for rechargeable Zn-air batteries.									192	5	0	0	10	0	191			1614-6832	1614-6840		WOS:000452679100004

The advance of this process relies on an effective catalyst. Herein, we employed single-atom Au doped Co-based nanosheets (NSs) to theoretically and experimentally evaluate the OER activity and also the interaction between Co and Au. We reveal that Au-Co(OH)(2) NSs achieved a low overpotential of 0.26 V at 10 mA cm(-2). This extraordinary phenomenon presents an overall superior performance greater than state-of-the-art Co-based catalysts in a sequence of alpha-Co(OH)(2) < Co3O4 < CoOOH < Au-Co(OH)(2). With ab initio calculations and analysis in the specific Au-Co(OH)(2) configuration, we reveal that OER on highly active Au-Co(OH)(2) originates from lattice oxygen, which is different from the conventional adsorbate evolution scheme. Explicitly, the configuration of Au-Co(OH)(2) gives rise to oxygen non-bonding (O-NB) states and oxygen holes, allowing direct O-O bond formation by a couple of oxidized oxygen with oxygen holes, offering a high OER activity.

Herein, a crystal morphological evolution mechanism is proposed for the synthesis of dodecahedral [Co(CN)6]3-@POMs (polyoxometalates) frame-like nanostructure. Through an inside-out etching process, K3PW12O40 (POMs) dodecahedron are transformed to dodecahedral POMs nanoframes with encapsulation of [Co(CN)6]3- inside the nanochannels, which can be transformed to Co, N, C co-doped POMs nanoframes (CNCP) by a further N2-pyrolysis process. The hybrid nanoframes possess unique yolk-shell structure with multiheteroatoms doping, showing great advantages for oxygen evolution reaction (OER). As an OER catalyst, it exhibits excellent electrochemical catalytic activities with a low overpotential of 241 mV at 10 mA cm-2, a small Tafel slope of 75.8 mV dec-1 and a long-term electrochemical stability. Our work not only provides novel dodecahedral Keggin-type polyoxometalates yolk-shell structure and nanoframes, but also provides a facile strategy to in situ encapsulate active components inside porous substrates, and thus will open a new perspective for the further utilization of POMs nanomaterials as potential catalysts for energy storage and conversion.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000740950400005

The catalyst exhibited excellent oxygen evolution reaction (eta(100) = 227 mV), hydrogen evolution reaction (eta(100) = 136 mV) and overall-water-splitting abilities (cell voltages = 1.60 V) in 1.0 M KOH to reach the current density of 100 mA/cm(2), respectively. The striking catalytic performances may be attributable to the hydrophilic and aerophobic characteristics of the multi-component chainmail electrocatalyst on NF that are easily in contact with the electrolyte to avoid the charge transfer impediment of the conventional conductive adhesive and to cause the generated bubbles to escape quickly. More importantly, the synergistic effect produced by the multi-component phosphides greatly increases the electrocatalytic performance of the sample. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Pan, Jie; Tan, Zhenyu; Pan, Guangsheng; Shan, Chunhong; Wang, Xiaolong; Liu, Yadi; Jiang, Jixiang								Investigation on the reaction mechanisms of generation and loss of oxygen-related species in atmospheric-pressure pulsed dielectric barrier discharge in argon/oxygen mixture								PHYSICS OF PLASMAS				23	7					073520	10.1063/1.4960119				JUL 2016	2016	This work presents a numerical investigation, using a 1-D fluid model, on the generation and loss of oxygen-related species and the spatial-temporal evolutions of the species densities in the atmospheric-pressure pulsed dielectric barrier discharge in the argon/oxygen mixture. The reaction pathways as well as their contributions to the generation and loss of oxygen-related species are given. The considered oxygen-related species include O, O(D-1), O-2((1)Delta(g)), O-3, O+, O-2(+), O-, O-2(+), and O-3(+). The following significant results are obtained. O, O(D-1), O-2((1)Delta(g)), and O- are produced mainly via the electron impact with O-2. Ar+ plays an essential role in the generation of O+ and O-2(+). Almost all of O-3 derives from the reaction O-2(+) O-2(+) O -> O-3 + O-2. The O-3-related reactions produce an essential proportion of O-2(+) and O-3(-). The substantial loss of O-, O-2(+), and O-3(+) is induced by their reactions with O-2(+). Loss of O+, O, and O(D-1) is mainly due to their reactions with O-2, loss of O-2((1)Delta(g)) due to O-2((1)Delta(g)) impacts with O-3 as well as the de-excitation reactions between O-2((1)Delta(g)) and e, O-2, and O, and loss of O-3 due to the reactions between O-3 and other neutral species. In addition, the densities of O+ and O(D-1) present two obvious peaks at the pulse duration, but the densities of O-2(+), O, O-2((1)Delta(g)), and O-3 are almost unchanged. The densities of negative oxygen ions increase at the pulse duration and then decline. O- density is obviously large nearby the dielectric surfaces and the densities of O-2(+) and O-3(-) present generally uniform distributions.

The development of economic bifunctional electrocatalysts with high activity and durability during reversible reactions remains a great challenge. The tailored porous structure and separately presented active sites for oxygen reduction and oxygen evolution reactions (ORR and OER) without mutual interference are most crucial for achieving desired bifunctional catalysts. Here, we report a hybrid composed of sheath-core cobalt oxynitride (CoOx@CoNy) nanorods grown perpendicularly on N-doped carbon nanofiber (NCNF). The brushlike CoOx@CoNy nanorods, composed of metallic Co4N cores and oxidized surfaces, exhibit excellent OER activity (E = 1.69 V at 10 mA cm(-2)) in an alkaline medium. Although pristine NCNF or CoOx@CoNy alone had poor catalytic activity in the ORR, the hybrid showed dramatically enhanced ORR performance (E = 0.78 V at -3 mA cm(-2)). The experimental results coupled with a density functional theory (DFT) simulation confirmed that the broad surface area of the CoOx@CoNy nanorods with an oxidized skin layer boosts the catalytic OER, while the facile adsorption of ORR intermediates and a rapid interfacial charge transfer occur at the interface between the CoOx@CoNy nanorods and the electrically conductive NCNF. Furthermore, it was found that the independent catalytic active sites in the CoOx@CoNy/NCNF catalyst are continuously regenerated and sustained without mutual interference during the round-trip ORR/OER, affording stable operation of Zn-air batteries.									19	0	0	0	1	0	19			1936-0851	1936-086X		WOS:000679406500022	34143611

Herein, this work demonstrates the integration of CoFe alloys and Fe/Fe3C nanoparticles into N-doped carbon nanosheets as an effective bifunctional electrocatalyst in Zn-air batteries. Thanks to the independent active sites for oxygen evolution and reduction reaction, the fabricated aqueous Zn-air battery exhibits a desirable operation stability of up to 350 h without significant performance deterioration. The promising power density (154.1 mW.cm(-2)) and specific capacity (803 mA h/g(Zn)) make this hybrid catalyst an ideal substitute for precious metal catalysts. Moreover, the solid-state flexible Zn-air battery has a large power density of 108.4 mW.cm(-2), which is enough to drive 35 diode lights. It is believed that this novel bifunctional catalyst may provide an interesting insight into the design of durable oxygen electrocatalysts for metal-air batteries.									24	1	0	0	0	0	24			2168-0485			WOS:000543715400014		
J	Du, Hao; Pu, Wenhong; Yang, Changzhu								Morphology control of Co3O4 with nickel incorporation for highly efficient oxygen evolution reaction								APPLIED SURFACE SCIENCE				541						148221	10.1016/j.apsusc.2020.148221				MAR 1 2021	2021	Co3O4 with different morphologies including nanomeshs, nanorods, and nanowires structures were prepared by one-step hydrothermal method using various precursors. The Co3O4 nanowires arrays showed the optimal oxygen evolution reaction (OER) performance with an overpotential of 394 mV at 20 mA cm(-2) and Tafel slope of 112 mV dec(-1) in alkaline electrolyte. Subsequently, the effect of Ni doping on OER activity of Co3O4 nanowires arrays was further studied under identical conditions. Notably, the as-prepared 12% Co3O4 (the molar ratio of Ni to Co is 12%) rendered the best activity with a low overpotential of 340 mV to achieve 20 mA cm(-2) and Tafel slope of 60 mV dec(-1), and superior stability, outperforming other Ni-Co3O4 samples. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations revealed that the theoretical overpotentials of Co3O4 and Ni-Co(3)O(4 )were calculated to be 1.70 V and 0.51 V, respectively, and the chemical conversion from OH* to O* is the ratelimiting step (RLS) with energy barrier of 1.74 eV for Ni-Co3O4. Therefore, this study provides a promising method for designing highly active and stable substitution for noble metal catalysts toward OER.									14	0	0	0	0	0	14			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000608916800008

Herein, single-atomic Ru sites anchored onto Ti(3)C(2)T(x)MXene nanosheets are first reported to serve as trifunctional electrocatalysts for simultaneously catalyzing acidic HER, OER, and ORR. A half-wave potential of 0.80 V for ORR and small overpotentials of 290 and 70 mV for OER and HER, respectively, at 10 mA cm(-2)are achieved. Hence, a low cell voltage of 1.56 V is required for the acidic overall water splitting. The maximum power density of an H-2-O(2)fuel cell using the as-prepared catalyst can reach as high as 941 mW cm(-2). Theoretical calculations reveal that isolated Ru-O(2)sites can effectively optimize the adsorption of reactants/intermediates and lower the energy barriers for the potential-determining steps, thereby accelerating the HER, ORR, and OER kinetics.									72	10	0	0	2	0	74			1613-6810	1613-6829		WOS:000548197400001	32662944

Unfortunately, the main limitation of ZABs is the low kinetics of air cathode, including oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER), making it necessary to develop catalysts with excellent performance to speed up the reaction rates and improve their efficiency. For these purposes, cobalt-based carbon has the advantages of low cost, high activity, and stability, which are suitable for oxygen electrocatalysts. In this review, the basic mechanisms of ORR and OER electrocatalysis are introduced and analyzed, and the development of cobalt-based carbon materials used as electrocatalysts in ZABs in recent years is reviewed, including cobalt oxide-based carbon, cobalt-nitrogen-doped carbon (Co-N-C), and cobalt bimetallic-based carbon. In addition, we review the use of in situ/in operando characterization techniques applied to trace the catalytic reactions. Finally, we provide an account of the current challenges and future perspectives for the design of new types of high efficiency and bifunctional electrocatalysts. (C) 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

A new transition metal boride-based self-supported electrocatalyst was prepared for efficient seawater electrolysis by directly soaking nickel foam (NF) in a mixture of phenolic resin (PR) and boron carbide (B4C), followed by an 800 degrees C annealing. During PR carbonization process, the reaction of B4C and NF generated nickel boride (NixB) with high catalytic activity, while PR-derived carbon coating was doped with boron atoms from B4C (B-C-PR). The B-C-PR coating fixed NixB/B4C particles in the frames and holes to improve the space utilization of NF. Meanwhile, the B-C-PR coating effectively protected the catalyst from the corrosion by seawater and facilitates the transport of electrons. The optimal NixB/B4C/B-C-PR/NF required 1.50 and 1.58 V to deliver 100 and 500 mA cm(-2), respectively, in alkaline natural seawater for the oxygen evolution reaction.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			1864-5631	1864-564X		WOS:000715357200001	34648234

The deposition temperature is one of the most important parameters for formation MnO2 NRAs and at 25 degrees C no MnO2 NRAs can be obtained. The results show that MnO2 has high activity and good stability for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and the structure of nanorod arrays pronounced enhances MnO2 activity. The onset potential of MnO2 NRAs is lower than that of Pt foil and lower 401 mV than that of MnO2 film, indicating that the structure of MnO2 NRAs shows an easy OER for water split. The MnO2 NRAs may be of great potential in electrochemical water split. Crown Copyright (C) 2012, Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Herein, a correlation between the OER overpotential and the cobalt-based electrode composition in a "Microparticles-in-Spider Web" (MSW) superstructure electrode is revealed. The overpotential is dramatically decreased first and then slightly increased with the continuous increase ratio of Co/Co3O4 in the cobalt-based composite electrode, corresponding to the dynamic change of electrochemically active surface area and charge-transfer resistance with the electrode composition. As a proof-of-concept, the optimized electrode displays a low overpotential of 260 mV at 10.0 mA cm(-2) in alkaline conditions with a long-time stability. This electrochemical performance is comparable and even superior to the most currently reported Co-based OER electrocatalysts. The remarkable electrocatalytic activity is attributed to the optimization of the electrochemically active sites and electron transfer in the MSW superstructure. Theoretical calculations identify that the metallic Co and Co3O4 surface catalytic sites play a vital role in improving electron transport and reaction Gibbs free energies for reducing overpotential, respectively. A general way of boosting OER kinetics via optimizing the electrode configurations to mitigate reaction overpotential is offered in this study.									29	1	1	0	3	0	30			1613-6810	1613-6829		WOS:000509349500001	31984658

Herein, we, for the first time, report the CoWO4 and NiWO4 nanoparticles as new highly efficient electrode materials for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in alkaline solutions. The study has shown that both the electrocatalysts efficiently evolve oxygen. At an overpotential (eta) in the OER region, the oxygen evolution current density on CoWO4 was much higher than that on NiWO4. At the current density of 10 mA cm(-2) (per geometrical area) in 1 M KOH, catalytic films of CoWO4 and NiWO4 on GC substrate produced eta approximate to 388 and 507 mV, respectively. When the GC catalyst support was replaced by nickel one, the overpotential required to achieve the current density of 10 mA cm(-2) on CoWO4 (eta approximate to 336 mV) and NiWO4 (eta approximate to 363 mV) electrodes decreased significantly.

However, there is still a lack of research on which chemical environment is more favorable for the catalytic performance of Ru. In this work, Ru nanoclusters are loaded on porous Co3O4 nanowires (Ru/Co3O4 NWs), spherical aberration-corrected transmission electron microscope and extended X-ray absorption fine structure confirm the coordination environment of Ru with oxygen bond. Compare to Co nanowires, Ru/Co3O4 NWs have the better HER performance in alkaline medium (an overpotential of 30.96 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2), electrochemical areas of 4.31 mF cm(-2)). Theoretical calculation also demonstrates the charge redistribution of Ru through the O binding, which has a smaller vertical bar Delta G(H*)vertical bar value. Besides, Ru clusters are loaded on Co foam and further oxygen doped to achieve efficient and stable HER activity. This work put a deep insight into the role of oxygen regulation of Ru-based HER catalysts.									42	2	0	0	1	0	43			2211-2855	2211-3282		WOS:000663443100002

In this work, a strategy is developed to fabricate anisotropic metallic Cobalt-Molybdenum Nitride materials combining hollow 3D structures and 2D nanosheets which result highly active OER electrocatalysts. The sample structure and morphology is investigated to derive its formation process following the synthesis strategy relying on the ligand-metal interactions of metal-organic framework (ZIF-67 and Mo-aMOF). Three different sample morphologies with large specific surface areas are obtained by changing the water and 2-methylimidazole contents. After ammonification in NH3, the morphologies and the specific surface areas of the samples are preserved. The electronic structure can also be adjusted to regulate electron density of Co and Mo by N-doping. These Co-Mo binary metals offer a viable way for realizing the electronic transfer between the different components, as demonstrated by XPS. Taking advantage from the above features, the as-obtained electrocatalyst exhibits a high catalytic activity and long-term cyclic stability for OER with low overpotential (eta(10) is 294 mV).									69	4	0	0	5	0	69			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000474501500025

Defects in electrocatalysts strongly influence their chemical properties and electronic structures, and can dramatically improve electrocatalytic performance. However, the development of defect-activated electrocatalyst with an efficient and stable water electrolysis activity in alkaline medium remains a challenge, and the understanding of catalytic origin is still limited. Here, we highlight defect-enriched bifunctional eletrocatalyst, namely, three-dimensional iron fluoride-oxide nanoporous films, fabricated by anodization/fluorination process. The heterogeneous films with high electrical conductivity possess embedded disorder phases in crystalline lattices, and contain numerous scattered defects, including interphase boundaries, stacking faults, oxygen vacancies, and dislocations on the surfaces/interface. The heterocatalysts efficiently catalyze water splitting in basic electrolyte with remarkable stability. Experimental studies and first-principle calculations suggest that the surface/edge defects contribute significantly to their high performance.									143	2	0	0	11	0	143			2041-1723			WOS:000431408300001	29728558

However, dissolution of metal components as one major cause of the degradation of the Pt-based electrocatalysts has not yet been fully ameliorated in engineering aspects until now. Here, we report an ultradurable PtRh nanodendrite (PtRh ND) electrocatalyst, with remarkable 88% of mass activity retained after an accelerated durability test for 90,000 cycles. Experimental results demonstrate an intense structural evolution of the PtRh NDs and consequently the formation of a Pt-rich surface during the initial potential cycling, and this newly formed structure has strong resistance to dissolution. Density functional theory calculations reveal a "self-healing" effect that the difference in the dissolution energy of Pt and Rh atoms leads to this structural evolution. Besides, the synergy effect of the Pt-rich surface and the inner PtRh alloy suppresses the further dissolution of metal components and thus endow the catalyst with ultrahigh durability. The findings in this work provide inspirations for better designs of highly stable Pt-based ORR electrocatalysts.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			2155-5435			WOS:000778789200005

In this work, the Fe-doped NiCoP/Prussian blue analog hollow porous nanocubes (Fe-NiCoP/PBA HNCs) were synthesized through a facile cation exchange of NiCo PBA HNCs followed by the phosphidation treatment. The optimal 2.5Fe-NiCoP/PBA HNCs exhibits a low OER overpotential of 290 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) and good stability, which is superior to the reported PBA-derived OER electrocatalyst. This high OER activity can be ascribed to the synergy effects of interfacial structure of Fe-NiCoP and PBA as well as the hollow porous structures, which could improve the electron transfer rate, reduce the reaction kinetics and expose more active sites. This work underscores that formation of multiple active components derived from the PBA is an effective strategy for designing high performance OER catalysts. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

The resulting CQD/NiFe-LDH complex exhibits high electrocatalytic activity (with an overpotential of similar to 235 mV in 1 M KOH at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2)) and stability for oxygen evolution, which almost exceed the values of all previously reported Ni-Fe compounds and were comparable to those of the most active perovskite-based catalyst.									380	33	0	0	26	0	390			1944-8244			WOS:000336639200114	24735390

However, deploying such a technology for use on industrial CO2 sources requires an understanding of the effects that gas feed impurities have upon CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR). In this work, we elucidate the impact of molecular oxygen on the network of reactions occurring in a CO2 reduction system. Our findings indicate that for a planar, polycrystalline Au electrode in an aqueous environment, oxygen reduction current is limited by the transport characteristics specific to the cell geometry and solvent; as a result, mass transport confers a protective effect by mitigating the otherwise thermodynamically and kinetically favorable reduction of oxygen. The presence of oxygen does not appear to have a significant impact on either CO2RR or hydrogen evolution partial currents, indicating that the mechanisms of reduction reactions involving oxygen are independent of CO2RR and hydrogen evolution. Further, an electrokinetic mechanistic analysis indicates many feasible candidates for the rate-determining step of CO2RR; there is no indication that the CO2RR mechanism at PCO2 1/4 0.5 atm is altered by the presence of oxygen, as the Tafel slopes (59 mV dec(-1)) and reaction orders with respect to bicarbonate (0), CO2 (1.5), and protons (0 from lack of KIE) are consistent between systems with PO 2 1/4 0 atm and those with PO 2 1/4 0.5 atm. While this is promising for the robustness of CO2RR to oxygen impurities in gas feeds, the ultimate design tradeoff when utilizing CO2 sources containing oxygen is between the cost of separation processes and the corresponding cost of power inefficiency as a result of electrons lost to oxygen reduction. This represents a first step in understanding kinetic and transport considerations in the design of gas-impurity-tolerant CO2 reduction systems.									12	1	0	0	3	0	12			2398-4902			WOS:000465598000009

Electrochemical catalytic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and catalytic oxidation of CO were performed to evaluate the relationship between the defects and catalytic properties. All the samples were prepared via a sol-gel method, and the composition was determined by ICP-OES. The valence of Mn was titrated by iodometric method. The oxygen defect(delta) was calculated according to the principle of neutrality. The chemical formulas of the samples were La-0.85 MnO2.80, La-0.80 MnO2.81 and La-0.75 MnO074, respectively. The structure, binding energy of Mn and morphology of the samples were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The specific surface area of the samples was determined by physical adsorption. The OER results indicated a linear relationship between the concentration of defect and OER property, while the La-0.80 MnO2.81 sample showed the best CO catalytic property.									2	2	0	0	0	0	2			0251-0790			WOS:000430988300003

Six different LSCO/XC-72 mass ratios were designed for the study as follows: 1:0 (pure LSCO), 10:1, 7:1, 5:1, 2:1 and 1:1. A thin-film oxygen electrode consisting of the LSCO/XC-72 catalysts was characterized in 0.1 M KOH solution using cyclic voltammetry (CV), rotating disk electrode (RDE) based linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). A physics-based, generalized electrochemical model was used to establish the charge-transfer mechanism and to obtain the electrode kinetic transfer coefficients and exchange current densities for the electrochemical reactions considered. The results show that the oxygen electrocatalysis process depends quite heavily on the carbon content in the catalyst, and there appears to be a synergistic effect between the perovskite-oxide and the XC-72, with a transition from the two-step, 2e(-) pathway to the direct 4e(-) transfer pathway as carbon content increases.

Because of the high cost and scarcity of noble metals, reducing the usage is a practical way to achieve scalable applications. Herein, for the first time, three novel electrocatalysts composed of noble metal phosphide (IrP2, Pd3P, or PtP2) nanoparticles with N,P-codoped nanocarbon were synthesized by the pyrolysis of mixtures of IrCl4, PdCl2, or PtCl4 with phytic acid under an ammonia atmosphere. With an ultralow loading of Pd (1.5 mug), Pt (1.4 mug), or Ir (1.6 mug) on the electrode, the Pd3P/ NPC, PtP2/NPC, and IrP2/NPC catalysts, respectively, exhibited excellent trifunctional catalytic activities for the oxygen reduction reaction, hydrogen evolution reaction, and oxygen evolution reaction. Notably, the IrP2/NPC-, Pd3P/NPC-, and PtP2/NPC-based water-splitting cells required only 1.62, 1.65, and 1.68 V, respectively, to deliver the current density of 10 mA cm-2. Furthermore, the IrP2/NPC-, Pd3P/NPC-, and PtP2/NPC-based zinc-air batteries exhibited higher specific capacities than that of Pt/C. IrP2/NPC exhibited a comparable performance to that of Pt/C-IrO2 for use in rechargeable zinc-air batteries. copy 2019 American Chemical Society.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1944-8244			INSPEC:19707327

Herein, the OER activity of NiFe-LDH nanoarray on carbon cloth (NiFe-LDH/CC) in alkaline media is shown to be greatly boosted by an amorphous NiFe-Borate (NiFe-B-i) layer formation on NiFe-layered double hydroxide (NiFe-LDH) surface. Such a NiFe-LDH@NiFe-B-i/CC catalyst electrode only needs an overpotential of 294 mV to drive 50 mAcm(-2) in 1.0M KOH; 116 mV less than that needed by NiFe-LDH/CC. Notably, this electrode also demonstrates strong long-term electrochemical durability. The superior activity is ascribed to the pre-formed amorphous NiFe-B-i layer effectively promoting active species generation on the NiFe-LDH surface. This work opens up exciting new avenues for developing high-performance water-oxidation catalyst materials for application.									62	3	0	0	0	0	63			0947-6539	1521-3765		WOS:000408308200008	28699228

In the present study, flowery-shaped In2MnSe4 nanoelectrocatalyst is fabricated by anion exchange reaction directly grown on nickel foam (NF) in 1.0 M KOH medium for oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The physiochemical and electrical characterization techniques are used to investigate the chemical structure, morphology, and electrical properties of the In2MnSe4 material. The electrochemical result indicates that synthesized material exhibits a smaller value of Tafel slope (86 mV/dec), lower overpotential (259 mV), and high stability for 37 h with small deterioration in the current density for a long time. Hence, the fabricated material responds with an extraordinary performance for the OER process and for many other applications in the future.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2				2079-4991		WOS:000822153300001	35808045

Here, we report a highly efficient OER electrocatalyst that features (Co/Fe)(4)O-4 cubane motifs in an amorphous nanoring structure. The Co/Fe codopants in the cubane motifs can optimize the intermediates adsorption and significantly lower the overpotentials of the OER. In addition to finely tuning the adsorption of intermediates, the amorphous nanoring structures provide rapid ion channels and high surface area for the OER. Phosphorylation also increases the wettability of electrocatalysts. As a result, the nanorings exhibit highly catalytic activities for the OER with a low overpotential of 300 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) and a small Tafel slope of 36 mV dec(-1) in an alkaline solution. The long-term durability is demonstrated for at least 20 h at 10 mA cm(-2). In brief, we demonstrate a tuning strategy of Co/Fe codoped cubane motifs in amorphous phosphate nanorings and thus open up an avenue of structural tunability for advanced catalyst design.									29	2	0	0	1	0	30			2155-5435			WOS:000467335600014

In this paper, the effect of oxygen vacancies (O-vac) on BiVO4 photoanode for PEC water splitting is studied using first principles calculations. The results indicate that the holes transfer at the electrode/electrolyte interface play a defining role in determining the surface catalytic activities, and thus functional characteristics of BiVO4 photoanode. There are two main reasons behind the enhancement of OER on the surface of the photoanode. First, the V site becomes the active site for PEC water splitting and the number of the active sites are greatly increased by inducing oxygen vacancies. Second, the adsorption energies of H2Oads OHads, and O-ads are higher in the presence of O-vac, which implies enhanced hole transfer from the photoanode surface to the electrolyte. The change of Gibbs free energy indicates a high possibility of spontaneous charge transfer to the electrolyte, facilitating OER on surfaces with O-vac. These results provide important insights into the roles of O-vac on BiVO4 surface for photocatalytic reactions.									70	1	0	0	2	0	71			1932-7447	1932-7455		WOS:000409395700042

However, most of present works for Co-based bimetallic MOFs are still in try-and-wrong stage, while the OER performance trend and the underlying structure-function relationship remain unclear. To address this challenge, Co-based MOFs on carbon cloth (CC) (CoM MOFs/CC, M = Zn, Ni, and Cu) are prepared through a room-temperature method, and their structure and OER performance are compared systematically. Based on the results of overpotential and Tafel slope, the order of OER activity is ordered in the decreasing sequence: CoZn MOF > CoNi MOF > CoCu MOF > Co MOF. Spectroscopic studies clearly show that the better OER performance of CoM MOFs results from the higher oxidation state of Co, which is related to the choice of second metal. Theoretical calculations indicate that CoZn MOFs possess strengthened adsorption for O-containing intermediate, and lower energy barrier towards OER. This study figures out the effect of second metal on the OER performance of Co-based bimetallic MOFs and suggests that tuning the electronic structure of the metal site can be an effective strategy for other MOFs-based OER catalysts.									27	1	0	0	2	0	28			1613-6810	1613-6829		WOS:000712086700001	34713572

Herein, we report a simple and facile strategy to synthesize 2D ultrathin CoFe2O4 nanosheets (NSs) with abundant oxygen vacancies by the reduction of Prussian blue analogs (PBAs) at room temperature using NaBH4. With large surface area, high density of surface-active sites, high electron transfer capability and durability, CoFe2O4 NSs show a low overpotential of 275 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) with a Tafel slope of 42.1 mV dec(-1) for the OER in alkaline medium, which is superior to that of the benchmark RuO2. What's more, CoFe2O4 NSs also exhibit a high catalytic activity for the OER with a low onset potential of 1.505 V and a high current density of 4.8 mA cm(-2) at 1.8 V in neutral medium. Both the oxygen vacancies and the synergistic effect between oxygen vacancies and Co3+ contribute to the excellent OER activity of CoFe2O4 NSs. Our finding opens up a new general route for developing highly efficient electrocatalysts for the OER.									46	3	0	0	2	0	47			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000463819400002

The Fe doping into Ni(OH)(2) dramatically enhances catalytic activity toward oxygen evolution reaction (OER) but fabricating Ni(OH)(2) of high Fe loading is still challenging. Herein, we report a one-pot strategy to prepare disordered beta-Ni(OH)(2) nanosheets with a high Fe doping level (9.9 at%, D-Fe-Ni(OH)(2)). By engaging 1,4-phenylenediphosphonic acid (BDPA), Fe(x)BDPA(y) precursors are in situ generated in a growth solution containing Fe3+ ions, which decrease the reaction kinetics of Ni2+ and Fe3+ ions at the surface of Ni foam. This prevents the deconstructive hydrolysis by Fe3+ ions and enables a high Fe-doping in D-Fe-Ni(OH)(2) . The as-prepared D-Fe-Ni(OH)(2) affords 10 mA cm(-2) at an ultralow OER overpotential of 194 mV in alkaline media. This work offers a promising strategy of engaging organic ligands to achieve high-doping levels for the construction of efficient electrocatalysts.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1				2567-3173		WOS:000820606900001

Electrocatalytic water splitting is a sustainable hydrogen energy production technology, which splits water into hydrogen and oxygen. In electrocatalytic water splitting, high activity catalysts can reduce the potential barrier of catalytic reaction and speed up the reaction, among which transition metal alloy catalysts have attracted extensive attention in the application of electrocatalysis due to their excellent electrochemical activity, stability and easy preparation. In this paper, the NiMoO4 precursor was firstly synthesized by the facile hydrothermal reaction, and then the self-supported NiMo alloy was synthesized by annealing. The results indicate that NiMo alloy has efficient hydrogen evolution activity (34 mV) and oxygen evolution activity (279 mV) at 10 mA cm(-2). More importantly, the water splitting system consisting of NiMo alloys demonstrates excellent performance and stability. At 10 mA cm(-2), the voltage is 1.489 V, and it can be stable for at least 10 hours at 70 mA cm(-2). This study can provide some ideas for the study of water splitting electrocatalysts.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2365-6549			WOS:000789873500001

In particular, Au@Co2P has a small overpotential of 321 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) in 1 M KOH aqueous solution at room temperature, which is about 95 mV less than pure Co2P. More importantly, the Tafel slope of Au@Co2P, at 57 mV dec(-1), is 44 mV dec(-1) lower than that of Co2P. Hence, Au@Co2P outperforms Co2P drastically in practical production when a high current density is required.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5				2046-2069		WOS:000510247900005	35540052

The composition of the ternary amorphous metal oxide catalyst film can be precisely controlled as to its precursor solution, and there was no phase segregation observed. The electrocatalytic activity of this ternary catalyst system was carefully mapped out as contour plots to illustrate the kinetics parameters such as onset potential, Tafel slope as well as the overall performance, i.e. the potential required to reach the benchmark current density. In this study, adding higher valence state material, Mo, into catalytic active metal oxides, such as CoOx and FeOx, to form Co50Mo50Ox and Fe(50)Mo(50)Ox could highly increase the catalyst stability. More importantly, the ternary metal oxide Fe10CO25Mo65Ox showed the advantage of the relatively low onset potential (1.52 V), low Tafel slope (similar to 31 mV/dec), lowest potential to reach the benchmark 1 mA/cm(2) and a better stability for the oxygen evolution reaction in Mo/Co/Fe system.

Transitional metal oxides (TMO) electrocatalysts have been actively pursued because of their low-cost and strong stability in alkaline. However, the efficiency for most of developed TMO has been refrained by poor intrinsic electrical conductivity and exposed active sites. Herein, we demonstrate a sulfur incorporation strategy to accomplish greatly optimized OER performance in CoFe2O4/MWCNT (S-CFO/MWCNT) nanocomposite. Sulfur incorporation into CoFe2O4 not only brings about more active sites in CFO frameworks, but also retains the pristine stable inverse spinel crystal structure which renders the high durability of the S-CFO/MWCNT catalyst. Specifically, the electrocatalysts exhibited greatly optimized OER catalytic activity with overpotential of about 0.36 V achieving current density of about 10 mA cm (2) and Tafel slope of about 43 mV dec (1), together with stronger stability. Our work demonstrates an effective way to pursue highly efficient OER electrocatalysts. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

A highly ordered self-assembled monolayer of CoTPP is formed on the Au(111) electrode. Cyclic voltammetry results show the OER activity of the electrode is enhanced with the increasing alkalinity of the electrolytes. The CoTPP molecules appear as two symmetric bright spots in STM images in alkaline solution, which is in sharp contrast to that in acidic solution. The molecular contour changes are attributed to the formation of the CoTPP-OH- species before OER, which is further confirmed by UV-vis absorption spectroscopy. In situ ECSTM results reveal the evolution from the CoTPP-OH- species to CoTPP molecules during OER.									31	1	0	0	3	0	31			0002-7863			WOS:000468366900003	31050417

Herein, we took LiCoO2, a prototype cation-exchanged layered metal oxide, as an example to study. By developing a simple synthetic route, we synthesized LiCoO2 nanosheets with 5-6 cobalt oxide layers, which are the thinnest ever reported. Ultrathin nanosheets thus prepared showed a surprising coexistence of increased oxidation state of cobalt ions and oxygen vacancy, as demonstrated by magnetic susceptibility, X-ray photoelectron, electron paramagnetic resonance, and X-ray absorption fine spectra. This unique feature enables a higher electronic conduction and electrophilicity to the adsorbed oxygen than the bulk. Consequently ultrathin LiCoO2 nanosheets provided a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at a small overpotential of a mere 0.41 V and a small Tafel slope of,similar to 88 mV/decade, which is strikingly followed by an excellent cycle life. The findings reported in this work suggest that ultrathin cation-exchanged layered metal oxides could be a next generation of advanced catalysts for oxygen evolution reaction.									38	3	0	0	4	0	38			1944-8244			WOS:000395494200046	28127957

Employing planar model electrodes in a rotating ring disk electrode (RRDE) setup, we used cyclic voltammetry at different rotation rates to test the reversibility of these reactions and quantify the number of electrons transferred during the ORR. Reversible ORR and OER are observed for all electrodes in neat BMP-TFSI electrolyte, while in the Mg2+ containing electrolyte (Mg-TFSI2) the OER is strongly hindered for all electrode materials. This goes along with the rapid build-up of a passivation layer during cycling, which increasingly inhibits also the ORR.

In this paper, we have developed a membrane protected anode, using anionic backbone of sulfonated polystyrene-block-(ethylene-ran-butylene)-block-polystyrene polymer (S-PSEBS) over the anode (IrO2/Ti) which is capable of electrostatically repelling the chloride ions (Cl-) from the electrode surface and thereby enhancing the oxygen evolution rather than the chlorine evolution. The electrochemical behavior of both polymer modified and bare IrO2/Ti electrodes were characterized by electrochemical polarization studies and the gas evolution efficiencies were calculated. The surface morphology of the electrodes was investigated using scanning electron microscope (SEM). The results suggest that nearly 95% oxygen evolution efficiency could be achieved when the surface of IrO2/Ti electrode was modified with a permselective membrane. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Importantly, the obtained electrocatalyst can display excellent activity for oxygen evolution reaction, which only needs 305 mV at 50 mA cm(-2) in 1 M KOH and 261 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) in 0.1 M KOH. Further mechanism studies disclose that the doping of Ru could reduce the thickness of nanosheets and contribute to the generation of active Co3+ sites by donating electrons from Co to Ru atoms via the Co-O-Ru bonds. This work paves a simple method to fabricate Co based nanosheet catalyst, which may be extended to the preparation of other highly active electrocatalysts. (C) 2021 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC.

Nonetheless, traditional powder electrodes have a high cost, and display problems related to the process itself and the poor stability over operation time. This paper presented a self-supported asymmetric porous ceramic electrode with WO3-x whiskers formed in situ on the walls of the finger-like holes and membrane surface, which was prepared by combining phase inversion tape-casting, pressureless sintering, and thermal treatment in a CO2 atmosphere. The optimized ceramic electrode displayed good catalytic HER activity and outstanding stability at high current densities. More specifically, it demonstrated the lowest overpotentials of 107 and 123 mV and the lowest Tafel slopes of 59.3 and 72.4 mV.dec(-1) at 10 mA.cm(-2) in acidic and alkaline media, respectively. This superior performance was ascribed to the structure of the ceramic membrane and the charge transfer efficiency, which was favored by the in situ developed WC/WO3-x heterostructure and the oxygen vacancies.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			2226-4108	2227-8508		WOS:000826828200005

The oxygen evolution reaction (OER) plays a key role of water decomposition. Here, we attached iron phthalocyanine to graphene, and explored the influence of different graphene substrates to catalytic activity using the first-principles methods based on density functional theory. Graphene improves the dispersion and electrical conductivity of iron phthalocyanine molecules, and facilitates its OER activity. The introduction of substrate promotes the electron transfer between FePc and the oxygen containing intermediates. The results indicated that the iron phthalocyanine exhibits different OER activity on various graphene substrates, among which the defective graphene most promoted the OER activity. The improved activity is originated from the axial interaction between the iron and carbon atoms on the defective graphene, leading to a moderate adsorption of oxygen-containing intermediates. Our study provides a reference for the regulation of molecular catalyst activity.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0039-6028	1879-2758		WOS:000729622500004

The function of CQDs hollowing and forming porous nanosheet shells was found. The resulting hierarchical architecture displays excellent oxygen evolution reaction activity with a low overpotential of 301 mV to drive 100 mA cm(-2) in 1.0 M KOH and long-playing durability in oxygen evolution. The high performance can be ascribed to its highly dispersed Co3O4 nanocrystals, CQDs and nitrogen codoping, internal cavities, and hierarchical pore system.									10	0	0	0	1	0	10			0020-1669	1520-510X		WOS:000461978700019	30810029

We have previously demonstrated that reaction centers from anoxygenic photosynthetic bacteria can be modified to bind a redoxactive Mn cofactor, thus gaining a key functional feature of photosystem II, which contains the site for water oxidation in cyanobacteria, algae, and plants [Thielges M, et al. (2005) Biochemistry 44: 7389-7394]. In this paper, the Mn-binding reaction centers are shown to have a light-driven enzymatic function; namely, the ability to convert superoxide into molecular oxygen. This activity has a relatively high efficiency with a k(cat) of approximately 1 s(-1) that is significantly larger than typically observed for designed enzymes, and a K-m of 35-40 mu M that is comparable to the value of 50 mu M for Mn-superoxide dismutase, which catalyzes a similar reaction. Unlike wild-type reaction centers, the highly oxidizing reaction centers are not stable in the light unless they have a bound Mn. The stability and enzymatic ability of this type of Mn-binding reaction centers would have provided primitive phototrophs with an environmental advantage before the evolution of organisms with a more complex Mn4Ca cluster needed to perform the multielectron reactions required to oxidize water.									15	0	0	0	13	0	15			0027-8424			WOS:000300489200036	22308385

Herein, the synthesized ultrathin PdPtAg-shells are located on twinned PdAg nanocrystals and deposited onto graphene (G) (denoted by PdAg@PdPtAg/rGO). The PdAg@PdPtAg/rGO nanocrystal shows a low overpotential of 22 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) and excellent electrochemical stability with 99.5% retention over either 12 h or 30 000 cycles of HER. Meanwhile, its ORR activities in acidic and alkaline media are very high and better than that of commercially available Pt/C. Both the experimental and calculated results suggest that the presence of an ultrathin PdPtAg alloy shell synthesized on a PdAg twinned support is the main reason for the greatly enhanced activities. Moreover, the twinned PdAg nanocrystal provides a number of twinned grain boundaries and defect sites (such as step, edge and kink sites). This typical structure represents a new strategy for synthesizing high-performance Pt-based catalysts, promoting their practical applications in energy conversion and storage devices.

J	Kim, Hyo-Young; Ju, Young -Wan								Influence of cobalt dopant in NiFe2-xCoxO4 (0 <= x <= 2) on electrochemical catalytic properties								INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY				46	77			38191	38197		10.1016/j.ijhydene.2021.09.065		OCT 2021		NOV 8 2021	2021	Environmental pollution has increased owing to the excessive consumption of fossil fuels. Thus, the combustion of which does not emit pollutants, has attracted attention for as an alternative fuel in various energy application systems. Using hydrogen energy has considered as an environmentally friendly solution to significantly reduce the dependency on fossil fuels and it can be produced by electrochemical water splitting. However, the sluggish kinetic reaction of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) during electrochemical water splitting reduces the efficiency of hydrogen energy. Therefore, an excellent electrochemical catalyst with superior electrochemical activity in OER is required to increase the energy conversion efficiency. In this study, a NiFe2-xCoxO4 (0 <= x <= 2) electrochemical catalyst was prepared by hydrothermal synthesis by controlling the amount of Co dopant. The influence of Co doping on the electrochemical catalytic activity of the prepared sample was evaluated by comparing the oxygen vacancies, bandgap, macroporosity and active surface area. Previous research have reported that abundant oxygen vacancies can improve the electrochemical catalytic activity. However, NiCo2O4 with the least number of oxygen vacancies exhibited excellent bifunctional catalytic activity for OER/oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) owing to the development of macropore, large active surface areas, and lower bandgap. Therefore, the bandgap and porosity such as macroporosity, large surface area, are an important factor that exert a greater influence than oxygen vacancies in electrochemical catalysts.

In this work, we demonstrate the high performance electrolyzer by using Fe-Co phosphide grown on Ni foam (FeCoP/NF) as HER electrode and self-supported FeCo2O4@FeCo2 SINF heterostructure as OER electrode. Thanks to the more active sites and faster charge transfer capability, the FeCoP/NF electrode can deliver low HER overpotentials of 59.6 and 233.6 mV at 10 and 100 mA cm(-2). Furthermore, the synergistic effect at interfaces also endows low overpotentials of FeCo2O4@FeCo2S4/NF at specific current densities. As a result, the designed FeCoP/NFIlFeCo(2)O(4)@FeCo2S4 /NF device just needs a voltage of 1.52 V to afford 10 mA cm(-2), indicating greatly potential in practical application.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			1793-6047	1793-7213		WOS:000793232900006

The solutions of the mass, momentum, energy and species conservation equations were simultaneously carried out by finite volume method. The Joule heating and Lorentz force were taken into account. The thermochemical and electrochemical transfers of oxygen and sulfur were represented through the application of a metallurgical thermodynamic and kinetic module. In order to obtain the evolution of oxygen activity, the chemical reaction between dissolved aluminum and dissolved oxygen in the metal was included. The comparison between the measured and simulated data indicates that the model can predicate the transfer behavior with an acceptable accuracy. The thermochemical reaction always removes oxygen and sulfur from the metal, while the electrochemical reaction brings oxygen and sulfur back to the metal through the metal droplet-slag interface, and takes them away from the metal through the metal pool-slag interface. The oxygen removal ratio is about 60%, and the contribution of the electrochemical reaction is around 82%. The sulfur removal ratio is approximately 76%, and the contribution of the electrochemical reaction is around 39%. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

The thermal stability of the processes of oxygen evolution and electron transfer from the oxygen-evolving complex to 2,6-dichlorophenolindophenol in photosystem II were significantly different: the reduction of 2,6-dichlorophenolindophenol was more resistant to temperature than oxygen evolution. The reaction of 2,6-dichlorophenolindophenol reduction in the Ca2+-depleted preparations of photosystem II was less resistant to heating than in the preparations of native photosystem II. The thermal inactivation of the photosystem II in the Ca2+-depleted membrane preparations was inhibited by cytochrome c at a concentration of 50 cytochrome c molecules per a photosystem II reaction center. The activity of this preparation (the rate of the 2,6-dichlorophenolindophenol reduction) increased by 19%, approaching the activity of the native photosystem II. The protective effect of cytochrome c appears to be determined by its protein nature, rather than its redox activity, since an equal protective effect was observed upon the addition of albumin at a similar concentration. Almost complete inactivation of the 2,6-dichlorophenolindophenol reduction reaction in the native and Ca2+-depleted preparations of photosystem II was observed at the same temperature (50degC). According to the EPR data, photosystem II in the Ca2+-depleted preparation after incubation at this temperature lacked a manganese cluster, while a peripheral protein of 33 kDa was present.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0006-3509			INSPEC:21186577

Compared with the widely studied oxygen vacancies, engineering metal vacancies into photocatalysts and study the effect of metal vacancies on the photocatalytic performance is seldom reported. Herein, we engineering bismuth vacancies into Bi2WO6 via a template-directed strategy to form single unit cell ultrathin nanosheets. Aberration-corrected scanning transmission electron microscopy reveals the formation of bismuth vacancies in the Bi2WO6 ultrathin nanosheets. Density functional theory calculations suggest that the presence of bismuth vacancies create a new defect level in forbidden band and increased density of states at the valence band maximum, resulting in increased charge carrier concentration and electronic conductivity. Moreover, the bismuth vacancy structure benefit for the surface adsorption and activation of water molecule, which favors the water oxidation reactions. As a result, the prepared bismuth vacancy-rich Bi2WO6 exhibit significantly increased visible light photocatalytic oxygen evolution activity than the corresponding bulk Bi2WO6, which is the more challenging half-reaction for fuel-forming due to the sluggish reaction kinetics. This work open the door for designing other metal vacancies engineered photocatalysts via ultrathin-control strategy and achieving highly efficient photocatalytic performances.									126	10	0	0	16	0	130			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000443666000013

Herein, we construct a new core-branch array and binder-free electrode by growing -Ni3S2 nanoflake branches on an atomic-layer-deposited (ALD) -TiO2 skeleton. Through induced growth on the ALD-TiO2 backbone, cross-linked -Ni3S2 nanoflake branches with exposed {(2) over bar 10} highindex facets are uniformly anchored to the preformed -TiO2 core forming an integrated electrocatalyst. Such a core-branch array structure possesses large active surface area, uniform porous structure, and rich active sites of the exposed {(2) over bar 10} high-index facet in the -Ni3S2 nanoflake. Accordingly, the -TiO2@ Ni3S2 core/branch arrays exhibit remarkable electrocatalytic activities in an alkaline medium, with lower overpotentials for both oxygen evolution reaction (220 mV at 10 mA cm(-2)) and hydrogen evolution reaction (112 mV at 10 mA cm(-2)), which are better than those of other -Ni3S2 counterparts.

At present, most of Ru nanoparticles-based HER electrocatalysts with high activity are supported by heteroatom-doped carbon substrates. Few metal oxides with large band gap (more than 5 eV) as the substrates of Ru nanoparticles are employed for the HER. By using large band gap metal oxides substrates, we can distinguish the contribution of Ru nanoparticles from the substrates. Here, a highly efficient Ru/HfO2 composite is developed by tuning numbers of Ru-O-Hf bonds and oxygen vacancies, resulting in a 20-fold enhancement in mass activity over commercial Pt/C in an alkaline medium. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that strong metal-support interaction via Ru-O-Hf bonds and the oxygen vacancies in the supported Ru samples synergistically lower the energy barrier for water dissociation to improve catalytic activities.Although ruthenium nanomaterials have proven to be effective catalysts for H-2 evolution, there is still room for activity improvements. Here, authors develop an efficient Ru/HfO2 electrocatalyst with tuned Ru-O-Hf bonds and oxygen vacancies that shows high activities for alkaline H-2 evolution.									15	1	0	0	1	0	16				2041-1723		WOS:000767892300014	35277494

To pursue cost-effective OER electrocatalysts with high activity and durable stability, we here set a facile strategy to prepare N-doped graphene supported core-shell FeNi alloy@N-doped carbon nanocages (FeNi@NC-NG) by annealing graphene oxides supported Prussian blue analogues under H-2/Ar atmosphere. Based on the specific structural benefits, the present catalyst shows superior OER catalytic activity than precious metal catalyst of RuO2 and Ir/C, with a low overpotential of 270 mV for 10 mA cm(-2), as well as high stability. The simple synthesis process and outstanding electrocatalytic performances show great potential of FeNi@NC-NG to replace the noble metal-based catalysts toward electrochemical water oxidation.									56	3	0	0	4	0	56			2168-0485			WOS:000444924500023

Herein, we report a novel hybrid nanostructure of Zn/Co bimetallic oxide (ZnxCo3-xO4) hollow polyhedron through a pyrolysis-oxidation strategy derived from bimetallic Zn, Co-zeolitic imidazolate frameworks (ZnCo-ZIFs) rhombic polyhedral. Benefiting from the synergistic effects between highly active metal oxide and the unique polyhedron structure, the ZnxCo3-xO4 hollow polyhedron hybrid displayed outstanding electrocatalytic performances in alkaline media. When the ZnxCo3-xO4 polyhedron was employed as electrocatalysts for OER, a potential as low as 1.66 V (vs. RHE) was required to deliver the current density of 10 mA cm(-2) in 1 M KOH, and ZnxCo3-xO4 still presented superior activity after continuously working for cyclic voltammetric scanning of 1000 cycles.

In this work, we report the synthesis of CuCoO2 (CCO) nanoplates through a facile one-step polyvinylpyrrolidone-assisted hydrothermal process. The influence of hydrothermal reaction parameters, including the precursor composition, reaction temperature and duration, on the morphology, size and crystal phase of CCO crystals has been investigated in detail. In addition, X-ray diffractometry (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) have been used to comprehensively characterize CCO's crystal structure, morphology, composition and chemical states of elements. Furthermore, the electrocatalytic performance of CCO nanoplates toward the OER is studied and compared to that of CCO micrometer-sized crystals. The CCO nanoplates only require a low overpotential of 390 mV to attain an anodic current density 10 mA cm(-2) in alkaline solution, and show comparatively fast OER kinetics with a Tafel slope of 70 mV dec(-1) and reasonably good long-term catalytic stability, substantially outperforming CCO microcrystals, which highlights the importance of size and morphology of CCO for use in OER electrocatalysis.									32	2	0	0	0	0	33			2168-0485			WOS:000455288800156

Herein, the coordination environment of a series of Co-based SACs (Co-1-SACs) was tuned to correlate the chemical structures of these catalysts with their electrocatalytic performance. The optimized Co-1-SACs containing Co-S2N2 sites are electrocatalytically active in both the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), which were carried out in alkaline media. The Co-1-SACs containing Co-S2N2 sites exhibit high ORR activity, with an onset potential of 0.99 V vs RHE and good stability, as well as have promising application in a zinc-oxygen battery with a high power density (260 mW cm(-2)) and open-circuit voltage (1.50 V), remarkable tolerance to large current density, and long-term operation. The ORR of the Co-S2N2 site is attributed to the optimized electron density of the Co atom through its cocoordination with adjacent S and N atoms. Moreover, the Co-1-SACs efficiently catalyze the HER, exhibiting a low overpotential (121 mV at 20 mA cm(-2)), a low Tafel slope (47 mV dec(-1)), and long-term stability. This work also provides a facile heteroatom-doping strategy to engineer the desired coordination environments in SACs for efficient electrocatalysis.									38	2	0	0	1	0	39			2155-5435			WOS:000641284700013

However, the sluggish kinetics during the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) can induce large voltage hysteresis, inferior roundtrip efficiency and unsatisfactory cyclic stability. Herein, hydrangea-like NiO@Ni2P heterogeneous microspheres are elaborately designed as high-efficiency oxygen electrodes for LOBs. Benefitting from the interfacial electron redistribution on NiO@Ni2P heterostructure, the electronic structure can be modulated to ameliorate the chemisorption of the intermediates, which is confirmed by density functional theory (DFT) calculations and experimental characterizations. In addition, the interpenetration of the P-O bond at the NiO@Ni2P heterointerface leads to the internal doping effect, thereby boosting electron transfer to further improve ORR and OER activities. As a result, the NiO@Ni2P electrode shows a low overpotential of only 0.69 V, high specific capacity of 18254.1 mA h g(-1) and superior long-term cycling stability of over 1400 h. The exploration of novel bifunctional electrocatalyst in this work provides a new solution for the practical application of LOBs.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			1613-6810	1613-6829		WOS:000742540800001	35032095

Trends of epitaxial perovskite oxide films catalyzing the oxygen evolution reaction in alkaline media [arXiv]								arXiv								31 pp.	31 pp.						14 Oct. 2020	2020	The oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is considered a key reaction for electrochemical energy conversion but slow kinetics hamper application in electrolyzers, metal-air batteries and other applications that rely on sustainable protons from water oxidation. In this review, the prospect of epitaxial perovskite oxides for the OER at room temperature in alkaline media is reviewed with respect to fundamental insight into systematic trends of the activity. First, we thoroughly define the perovskite structure and its parameter space. Then, the synthesis methods used to make electrocatalytic epitaxial perovskite oxide are surveyed, and we classify the different kinds of electrodes that can be assembled for electrocatalytic investigations. We discuss the semiconductor physics of epitaxial perovskite electrodes and their consequences for the interpretation of catalytic results. Prototypical mechanisms of the OER are introduced and comparatively discussed. OER investigations on epitaxial perovskite oxides are comprehensively surveyed and selected trends are graphically highlighted. The review concludes with a short perspective on opportunities for future electrocatalytic research on epitaxial perovskite oxide systems. [J. Phys.

In this work, we construct novel hollow Ni-doped CoP nanoparticles embedded in hollow carbon polyhedron (denoted as H-Ni-CoP@HC) by using Ni-ZIF-67 as precursor through a developed pyrolysis-phosphidation strategy. The hollow structures of both cages and nanoparticles (NPs) endow the materials with abundant exposed active sites and significantly decreased mass transport resistance. Moreover, the material possesses strong electronic coupling between CoP and NiCoP. Consequently, low overpotentials of 170 and 150 mV are able to drive oxygen and hydrogen evolution at current densities of 10 mA cm(-2) in 1.0 M KOH solution over H-Ni-0.04-CoP@HC, respectively. Furthermore, the H-Ni-0.04-CoP@HC as a bifunctional catalyst for overall water splitting yields current densities of 10 mA cm(-2) at 1.47 V vs. RHE.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0022-2461	1573-4803		WOS:000830341600001

The as-prepared samples have been characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS). XRD shows a typically crystal phase of Ni3N on nickel foam. The broad peak of (100) suggests smaller particle size of Ni3N on NF. SEM images confirm that Ni3N films cover on the surface of NF. Ni3N films are composed of many uniform nanoparticles, implying larger surface area and more exposed active sites. Electrochemical measurements show that Ni3N/NF exhibits superior OER activity with excellent stability, which can be attributed to more active sites and the enhanced conductivity derived from NF as support. Ni3N/NF as electrocatalysts for OER may provide novel idea for preparing highly active electrocatalysts from non-noble metallic nitrides.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1947-2935	1947-2943		WOS:000385609300021

However, the increased defects may induce aggregation and decrease active sites over a long period of time, which in turn impairs the catalytic performance. Thus, the development of new strategies for producing non-noble catalysts with maintained active sites for long-term stability is an attractive goal. Here we demonstrate the fabrication of defect-rich carbon nanotubes by the doping of nitrogen and the hybridization of multi-metal chalcogenides with the help of metal-organic-framework (MOF) precursors. The obtained porous carbon nanohybrids exhibit extraordinary electrocatalytic performance in alkaline environments with overpotentials as low as 116 mV for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Remarkably, the overpotential for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) significantly decreased to 137 mV after 6000 cycles. In combination with theoretical calculations, it is revealed that in this HER process, the formed sulfur vacancies can be dynamically occupied by hydrogen atoms. This hydrogen occupation may prevent the aggregation of active sites in the long term. This work thus offers an efficient strategy for improving HER and OER activities.									13	1	0	0	0	0	13			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000485971900051	31461094

Our results show that the reactivity of the TiO2 surface is tuned by electric dipoles dynamically induced by the adsorbed species during the intermediate steps of the reaction while the initial and final steps remain unaffected. Compared to the OER on unsupported TiO2, the combined effects of the dynamically induced dipoles and epitaxial strain strongly reduce rate-limiting thermodynamic barriers and significantly improve the efficiency of the reaction.									47	1	0	0	1	0	47			0031-9007	1079-7114		WOS:000335832300002	24877949

The development of low-cost, highly efficient and stable electrocatalyst is essential to a large-scale application of energy storage and conversion devices. Recently, emerging plasma technology has been employed as one of the practical ways to synthesize and modify electrocatalysts due to its unique property. In this review, we summarized the latest applications of plasma in energy storage and conversion, including using it as the preparation and modification technology of the various electrocatalysts and the usage of it as the synthesis technology directly. Firstly, we presented the definition and types of plasma reactors and their respective characteristics. Then, these applications of plasma technology in many essential electrode reactions including carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CO2RR), nitrogen fixation, oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) were introduced. Finally, the challenges and outlook of plasma technology in energy storage and conversion were summarized, and the solutions and prospected its development in the future were present.

Though many studies have been conducted, it is necessary to systematically summarize and introduce the research on photocatalytic O-2 evolution, and thus a systematic review is needed. First, the corresponding principles about O-2 evolution and some urgently encountered issues based on the fundamentals of photocatalytic water splitting are introduced. Then, several types of classical water oxidation photocatalysts, including TiO2, BiVO4, WO3, alpha-Fe2O3, and some newly developed ones, such as Sillen-Aurivillius perovskites, porphyrins, metal-organic frameworks, etc., are highlighted in detail, in terms of their crystal structures, synthetic approaches, and morphologies. Third, diverse strategies for O-2 evolution activity improvement via enhancing photoabsorption and charge separation are presented, including the cocatalysts loading, heterojunction construction, doping and vacancy formation, and other strategies. Finally, the key challenges and future prospects with regard to photocatalytic O-2 evolution are proposed. The purpose of this review is to provide a timely summary and guideline for the future research works for O-2 evolution.									54	1	0	0	4	0	53				2198-3844		WOS:000589949400001	33437579

Herein, RuSe2/MoOx composite (RSMC) is constructed through a simple and convenient solid phase reaction (SPR) strategy, and is further studied as a potential electrocatalyst for OWS. At first, we prepared RuO2/MoSe2 composite (RMC) precursor. When the RMC was heat-treated in a N2 atmosphere, the SPR occurred between RuO2 and MoSe2. Therefore, RMC was converted into RuSe2/MoOx composite (RSMC) in-situ, accompanied by the formation of oxygen vacancies (VO) in the MoOx phase. In this work, the overpotential of RSMC-500 (prepared by annealing the RMC precursor at 500 degrees C in a N2 atmosphere) at 10 mA cm-2 under alkaline conditions (1 M KOH) are 58 (HER) and 270 mV (OER), respectively. When using RSMC-500 as anode and cathode materials to make an electrolytic cell, a low cell voltage of 1.57 V is required under alkaline condition to achieve the current density of 10 mA cm-2. The good performance shows the potential application of RSMC-500 in the field of renewable and clean energy area.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0254-0584	1879-3312		WOS:000729380500006

In this work, composite electrodes have been prepared containing geopolymer (made from Fly Ash (FA)), zinc, and Multiwalled Carbon Nanotubes (MWCNT) or graphite deposited on a nickel foam with different compositions (FA:Zn:MWCNT or FA:Zn:Graphite, mass ratio = 12:6:1 or 6:6:1). While the commercial zinc plate demonstrated clear oxidation and reduction reactions during cyclic voltammetry, no electrochemical reactions of zinc were observed with the composite electrodes. The composite electrodes suffered from high resistance, which could not be overcome even with reduced geopolymer content. The FE-SEM images indicated that the composite electrodes containing MWCNT were better dispersed than those containing graphite. Moreover, the composite electrode containing FA:Zn:MWCNT = 6:6:1 showed a lower overpotential for Oxygen Evolution Reaction (OER) compared to those with FA:Zn:Graphite at the same mass ratio. The surface morphology, homogeneity and chemical compositions lead to the change of the electrocatalyst activity towards OER. The electrode containing MWCNT may be attractive as anode for alkaline water electrolysis for hydrogen production. Further experiments should focus on optimization of the electrode composition to enhance its conductivity, activity and stability.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			1823-4690			WOS:000451703200002

Cobalt oxides (CoOx) have been explored owing to their high availability and high activity when applied in reactions involving oxygen, including the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). Effective anchoring between the metal oxide active sites and the conducting carbon support is another puzzling task to consider when enhancing the overall catalytic activity of the materials. To investigate the role of anchoring sites on the carbon support, we grew catalytically active cobalt oxide nanoparticles on pristine carbon nanotubes (CNTs), oxy-group functionalized CNTs (fCNTs), and nitrogen-doped (N-doped) CNTs (NCNTs). The anchoring sites on CNTs not only hold the CoOx nanoparticles but they are also involved in controlling the size and distribution of the CoOx during the synthesis process by creating nucleating sites. The distribution and interaction of CoOx on CNT, fCNT, and NCNT was confirmed by employing structural and spectroscopic characterization techniques such as TEM, XRD, XPS, and Raman analysis. The electrochemical OER activity screening of the prepared catalysts showed the highest performance of CoOx-supported NCNT (Co@NCNT) with the lowest overpotential (eta) of 310 mV @ 10 mA cm(-2) and a lower kinetic Tafel slope of similar to 74.67 mV dec(-1).									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			2398-4902			WOS:000616375400018

Herein, we proposed a novel non-noble metal bifunctional HER/OER electrocatalyst by synergistically coupling a dual-active Co-based heterojunction (Co-CoO) with high conductive and stable two-dimensional Ti3C2-MXene (defined as Co-CoO/Ti3C2-MXene). A series of characterizations and theoretical calculations verify that the synergistic effect of metallic Co with HER activity and CoO with OER performance leads to superb bifunctional catalytic performance, and Ti3C2-MXene can enhance electrical conductivity and prevent the aggregation of the Co-based catalysts, thereby improving both the activity and stability. Co-CoO/Ti3C2-MXene presents low onset potential (eta(onset)) of 8 mV and Tafel slope of 47 mV.dec(-1 )for HER (close to that of PVC) and eta(onset) of 196 mV and Tafel slope of 47 mV.dec(-1) for OER (superior to that of RuO2). Assembled as an electrolyzer, Co-CoO/Ti3C2-MXene shows a low voltage of 1.55 V at 10 mA.cm(-2), high Faradaic efficiency and remarkable stability. It can be driven by a solar cell of similar to 1.55 V for consecutive production of hydrogen and oxygen gases.									19	1	0	0	0	0	19			1998-0124	1998-0000		WOS:000657608100001

Further improvement of these complex perovskites is the next necessary topic for specific applications. Herein, two complex perovskites, La0.6Sr0.4Co0.8Fe0.2O3-delta (LSCF) and Ba0.5Sr0.5C0.05Fe0.2O3-delta (BSCF), are exploited as the examples to demonstrate the double cation defectsintroduced method of A1 and A2 to supply superimposed enhancement of the activity and stability. This is based on the fact that the increased content of oxygen vacancies and coordination can balance the oxygen vacancy and B-site element oxidation state. The electrochemical measurements revealed that the optimized A-LSCF10 and A-BSCF10 both exhibit outstanding OER catalytic activity. A small Tafel slope (57 mV dec(-1)) and a low overpotential (228 mV at 10 mA cm(-2)) for A-LSCF10 (vs 93 mV dec(-1) and 345 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) for A-LSCFO), and a small Tafel slope (65 mV dec(-1) and an overpotential (242 mV at 10 mA cm(-2)) for A-BSCF10 (vs 66 mV dec(-1) and 308 mV at 10 mA cm(-2). for A-BSCFO) are determined, as well as good stability for 24 h.									7	1	0	0	2	0	7			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000611066000028	33373179

Therefore, developing highly active and integrated catalysts is of great significance. Herein, we present a facile and viable method to fabricate flower-like NiFe oxide nanosheets electrocatalysts that are directly grown on nickel foam substrates through a hydrothermal reaction. By tuning the Ni:Fe ratio, the as-synthesized NiFe oxide exhibits excellent catalytic activity that surpasses the activity of the RuO2 benchmark catalyst, when tested as an electrocatalyst for the overall water splitting reaction. More importantly, the optimized NiFe oxide electrode possesses excellent OER activity in 1 M KOH with small overpotentials of 255 and 280 mV at 10 and 50 mA cm(-2), respectively. When employed as a stable bifunctional catalyst to split water, this electrode achieved a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at a cell voltage of 1.59 V. This work presents a highly promising candidate for use as an electrode material and represents promising progress in its practical utilization and comprehensive industrialization.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			1452-3981			WOS:000467818200068

After the Co incorporation for water electrolysis and zinc-air systems, the active surface area is enhanced, whereas the charge-transfer and mass-transfer resistances are reduced significantly. Due to the dual modulation in the electric conductivity and active surface area t induced by the Co-doping, the hierarchically porous trimetal nitrides show high activity and good stability for the hydrogen evolution reaction, oxygen evolution reaction, and oxygen reduction reaction. The two-electrode electrolyzer assembled by the bifunctional electrocatalysts can deliver 10 mA cm(-2) at a voltage of merely 1.57 V, compared to the best reported electrocatalysts. Meanwhile, two all-solid-state zinc-air batteries in series can power more than 50 red light-emitting diodes and the two-electrode electrolyzer catalyzed by the multifunctional electrocatalysts with excellent operation stability.									44	4	0	0	4	0	45			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000480498600028	31305065

To enhance electrochemical catalytic activity of catalyst, a series of 3D microporous amorphous metallic phosphides, such as NiP, FeP, CoP, NiFeP, FeCoP, NiCoP and NiFeCoP, were electrodeposited on nickel mesh (dubbed NM) via hydrogen bubbles electroplating technique. The electrocatalytic performances of all as-prepared phosphides in alkaline solution for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) were investigated. The optimal 3D microporous NiFeCoP/NM electrode exhibits remarkable catalytic activity for HER and delivers a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) only required an extremely low overpotential (33mV) and a small Tafel slope (71.1 mV dec(-1)) in 1.0 M KOH solution. Meanwhile the NiFeCoP/NM electrode also shows outstanding strong durability and robustness in alkaline water electrolysis. Further, the NiFeCoP/NM electrode displays superior catalytic activity towards OER. In a two-electrode water electrolytic cell, the bi-functional NiFeCoP/NM electrodes could obtain current densities of 10 and 50 mA cm(-2) at overall cell potentials of only 1.64 and 1.82 V, respectively. The remarkable electrocatalytic activities of the NiFeCoP/NM electrode both for HER and OER are attributed to the synergistic effect of tri-metal elements in metallic phosphide, amorphous phase structure, and the superlarge electrochemical surface area fabricated by the hydrogen bubbles electroplating.

Because metalloporphyrinoids show strong absorption in the visible region and redox active, metalloporphyrinoids are also suited as photoredox catalysts for photo-driven redox reactions using solar energy. In particular, metalloporphyrins are utilized as pivotal components to mimic the structure and function of the photosynthetic reaction center. Metalloporphyrins are used as photoredox catalysts for hydrogen evolution from electron and proton sources combining hydrogen evolution catalysts. Metalloporphyrins also act as thermal redox catalysts for photocatalytic reduction of CO2 with photoredox catalysts. Metalloporphyrins are also used as dual catalysts for a photoredox catalyst for oxygenation of substrates with H2O and a redox catalyst for O-2 reduction when dioxygen is used as a two-electron oxidant and H2O as an oxygen source, both of which are the greenest reactants. Free base porphyrins can also be employed as promising photoredox catalysts for C-C bond formation reactions.									8	0	0	0	0	0	8			1088-4246	1099-1409		WOS:000516708800003

In this work, a nanocomposite electrocatalyst based on partially oxidized Ni nanoparticles supported on Ni-N co-doped carbon nanofibers (PO-Ni/Ni-N-CNFs) was developed using low-cost hydrothermal carbonaceous nanofibers, pyrrole, and NiCl2 as precursors. Benefiting from effective active sites, mesoporous structure, and interlinked nanofiber network, the as-obtained nanocomposite electrocatalyst exhibited superior catalytic activity and durability for both HER and OER in alkaline media.

Li-air batteries are expected to revolutionize the automobile industry (for use in electric and hybrid vehicles) and electrochemical energy storage systems by surpassing the energy capacities of conventional Li-ion batteries. However, the practical implementation of Li-air batteries is still hindered by many challenges, such as low cyclic performance and high charging voltage, resulting from oxygen transport limitations, electrolyte degradation, and the formation of irreversible reduction products. Therefore, various methodologies have been attempted to mitigate the issues causing performance degradation of Li-air batteries. Among myriad studies, theoretical and numerical modeling are powerful tools for describing and investigating the chemical reactions, reactive ion transportation, and electrical performance of batteries. Herein, we review the various multi-physics/scale models used to provide mechanistic insights into processes in Li-air batteries and relate these to overall battery performance. First, continuum-based models describing ion transport, pore blocking phenomena, and reduction product precipitation are presented. Next, atomistic modeling-based studies that provide an understanding of the reaction mechanisms in oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), as well as ion-ion interactions in the electrolyte, are described.									13	0	0	0	0	0	13			1996-1073			WOS:000417046500067

Starting with the embedded cobalt nanoparticles, the concentration of oxygen-vacancy defect can vary with the degree of Kirkendall oxidation, thus regulating the number of active sites and the catalytic performances. The optimized freestanding catalyst shows among the smallest reversible oxygen overpotential of 0.74 V for catalyzing oxygen reduction/evolution reactions in 0.1 m KOH.

Therefore, it is necessary to have in-depth study on the origin behind their favorable inherent OER activity and further improve their catalytic performance. Herein, nickel-cobalt-vanadium trimetallic (oxy)hydroxide nanosheets decorated with silver nanoparticles (Ag NPs) (Ag@NiV0.2Co0.2) are fabricated for OER by a simple spontaneous redox reaction. The Ag@NiV0.2Co0.2 can deliver an overpotential of only 255 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) and a small Tafel slope of 38.3 mV dec(-1) in alkaline solution. We accredit the outstanding catalytic performance to the following aspects: (1) the active (oxy)hydroxide layer on the surface of Ag@NiV0.2Co0.2 generated through the surface reconstruction, (2) the optimal local coordination induced by the interaction between Ag NPs and trimetallic system, (3) the extensively exposed active sites, and (4) the significantly improved charge-transfer ability due to the incorporation of Ag NPs.

Using a potentiostatic double pulse technique, the average particle size was varied in the range from 5 nm to 30 nm in the case of HOPG as a support and between <1 nm and 15 nm on diamond surfaces, while keeping the particle density constant. The distribution of particle sizes was very narrow, with standard deviations of around 20% on HOPG and around 30% on diamond. The electrocatalytic activity towards hydrogen evolution and oxygen reduction of these carbon supported gold nanoparticles in dependence of the particle sizes was investigated using cyclic voltammetry. For oxygen reduction the current density normalized to the gold surface (specific current density) increased for decreasing particle size. In contrast, the specific current density of hydrogen evolution showed no dependence on particle size. For both reactions, no effect of the different carbon supports on electrocatalytic activity was observed.									45	0	0	0	2	0	45			1420-3049			WOS:000298411200021	22146369

Layered double hydroxides (LDHs) are considered as promising electrocatalysts toward OER. However, their electronic properties and active sites need to be optimized for their large-scale application. Herein, rapidly cationic defect and anion dual-regulated CoAl LDHs (PS-CoAl LDHs) were in situ synthesized in a few minutes via a modified water DBD plasma treatment. Abundant Al3+ vacancies and a relatively rough surface for S2- regulation were formed by the etching effect of the plasma. Consequently, the as-obtained PS-LDHs possess improved intrinsic conductivity and an optimal electronic structure. Simultaneously, the synergistic effect of the Al3+ vacancies and S2- regulation promote the exposure of active Co sites, resulting in an amorphous and porous surface for improving the OER performance.									65	6	0	0	3	0	67			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000439319000038	29985509

Cyclic voltammetry on different electrodes was applied to study the electrochemical reaction mechanism of the reduction of NiO in the melt. In addition, NiO pellets were reduced by constant voltage electrolysis for different times. The results disclose that the reduction of nickel oxide is a one-step reaction and the side reaction, hydrogen evolution, may lower the current efficiency during the constant voltage electrolysis. The current efficiency increases from 25.9% to 87.2% with the addition of sodium oxide which leads to a higher cathodic potential for the hydrogen evolution reaction and, therefore, prevents it occurring.

Quantitative and reliable chemical imaging methods can play a crucial role in providing critical catalyst efficiency information for materials development and screening. Here, we developed a reflection optical imaging method to map the performance of transition metal oxide catalysts for oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The generated high concentration of oxygen in the electrolyte will decrease the refractive index of the solutions near the electrode and change the reflectivity of optical images. We successfully imaged and measured the OER on cobalt oxide, and the localized current density and overpotential distribution maps have been extracted. The oxidation and reduction of cobalt oxide can be imaged with our reflection optical imaging method as well. These maps showed that the catalytic activities are quite different at different locations, and some regions showed much higher activities. This is due to the non-uniformity created by the catalyst synthesis process and demonstrates the importance of using the optical imaging method to map the localized catalytic efficiency. In addition, the NiFe alloy's OER catalytic activities have been studied as well. The proposed reflection optical imaging method could find many applications in catalyst activity measurement and screening.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0013-4651	1945-7111		WOS:000791564300001

Here, we synthesized a unique hybrid catalyst characterized by ultrafine cobalt/iron mixed oxide domains embedded in two-dimensional (2D) monolayer hydroxides through thermal reconstruction of layered double hydroxide precursors, which exhibits excellent OER performance in alkaline media, much superior to state-of-the-art iridium oxide catalyst. In addition to the structural advantages, the chemical coordination evolution was found to achieve metal electronic tuning in favor of intrinsic activity, and in-situ bond hydroxyl groups beneficial to conductivity and hydrophilicity, contributing together to OER kinetics. Coordination adaption of transition metal sites suggests an intuitive active-site descriptor with high-covalent transition metal-oxy-hydroxyl coordination. This work not only renders a cost-effective OER catalyst, but also provides a universal guideline for transition metal site activation.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0				2352-4928		WOS:000708809300002

Herein, we report a general in-situ electrochemical approach for the synthesis of amorphous metal hydroxide-based microarrays assembled on nickel foam (NF) by using leaflike CoM-ZIF-L as precursors for boosting OER performance. It is demonstrated that an electrochemical cyclic voltammetry (CV) redox process can promote the ligand substitution of CoM-ZIF-L to afford highly-active amorphous metal hydroxides with abundant oxygen defects via activating the reversible redox of metal ions, removing 2-methylimidazole and subsequently capping OH-. As expected, the optimized aCo(OH)(2)-ZIF-L/NF can provide rich catalytic sites, good conductivity and short ion diffusion paths, all of which are responsible for its excellent OER activity. Further experiment and DFT calculation results confirm that the in-situ formed defective amorphous metal oxy(hydroxide) is the real active species for this electrocatalytic reaction.									27	0	0	0	2	0	27			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000663215600001

Perovskite oxides are a group of promising candidates to lower the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) barriers in water splitting and further improvement of their activity and durability is an important objective. Here we report scandium and niobium cation (Sc3+ and Nb5+) doped strontium cobaltite perovskites (SrScxNbyCo1-x-yO3-delta) as a family of highly active and durable electrocatalysts for the OER in alkaline solution. These perovskites not only manifest up to a factor of 50 increase of the intrinsic activity compared to the gold-standard OER electrocatalysts (such as IrO2 and RuO2) and a factor of 5.8 enhancement to the perovskite-Ba0.5Sr0.5Co0.8Fe0.2O3-delta at an overpotential of 0.35 V, but also, more importantly, show excellent durability in alkaline solutions under operation.									116	1	0	0	8	0	117			2051-6347	2051-6355		WOS:000359586600004

We report a novel misfit-layered compound Gd0.3Ca2.7Co3.82Cu0.18O9-delta (GCCCO) as a superior and durable bifunctional oxygen electrode material for RPCCs. The maximum power densities achieved with GCCCO cells are notably high, reaching 1.16 and 2.05 W cm(-2) at 600 and 700 degrees C, respectively, in the fuel cell mode, surpassing previously reported results. Moreover, in the electrolysis mode, the GCCCO cells reached current densities of -1.53 and -9.35 A cm(-2) at 500 and 700 degrees C, respectively, at an applied voltage of 1.5 V. The superior catalytic performances of GCCCO are correlated to the oxygen defect rich structure, triple (O2-/H+/e(-))-conducting property, needle-like grain morphology, and suitable thermal expansion coefficient.									17	1	0	0	2	0	17			1754-5692	1754-5706		WOS:000639552600001

Analyses of the oxidation products have shown that in 1 M HClO4 the main reaction is oxygen evolution, while in H2SO4 the main reaction is the formation of H2S2O8. In both electrolytes small amounts of O-3 and H2O2 are formed. Finally, a simplified mechanism involving hydroxyl radicals formed by water discharge has been proposed for water oxidation on boron-doped diamond anodes.									249	9	0	0	64	8	254			0021-891X	1572-8838		WOS:000183328600003

It shows high OER catalytic activity and stability under alkaline conditions, which makes it one of the hot spots in OER catalysts. The intrinsic electrocatalytic activity of the NiFe LDH can be further improved via doping to tailor surface electronic structure and valence state. The NiFe-Vx catalysts were prepared by onestep hydrothermal method. Compared with that of undoped NiFe LDH, the oxygen evolution overpotential of NiFe-V1.0 was reduced by 37 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm-2, the Tafel slope is decreased by 43.37 mV dec-1. The results demonstrated that V doping can enhance the electron transfer of LDH, and increase the electrochemical active surface area, leading to the enhanced OER activity.

Learning from the most active catalysts for the OER, iridium oxides, would be the key to the development and establishment of design guidelines for active and stable OER catalysts. This article reviews in situ or operando spectroscopic and advanced computational studies in the past decade concerning the OER over iridium oxide for both the oxidation of water molecules and hydroxide ions. By collectively reviewing the reported findings, we illustrate the plausible OER catalytic cycles including the dissolution of iridium during the reaction, which at the same time disclosed discrepancies in the proposed mechanisms. Such discrepancies are thought to originate from variations in the experimental conditions employed in those studies, calling for comprehensive and systematic in situ or operando studies in the future. Toward the end, we discuss a recent approach for improving the activity and stability of OER catalysts.									26	0	0	0	1	0	26			2052-1553			WOS:000656652700022

The samples were mainly characterized by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), high angle annular dark-field scanning TEM (HAADF-STEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The architectures had larger electrochemically active surface area (ECSA) of 23.84 m(2) g(Pt)(1) than Pt1.2Co1 nanocrystals (NCs, 14.96 m(2) g(Pt)(1)), Pt3.7Co1 NCs (16.96 m(2) g(Pt)(1)) and commercial Pt black (20.35 m(2) g(Pt)(1)). And the as-obtained Pt2.6Co1 catalyst displayed superior catalytic performance and better durability for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) as compared to Pt1.2Co1 NCs, Pt3.7Co1 NCs, commercial 50% Pt/C and Pt black catalysts in acid and alkaline media. Meanwhile, the electrocatalytic performance of Pt2.6Co1 NFs for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is better in acid media as compared with that in alkaline media. It indicates the great potential applications of the as-prepared catalyst in fuel cells. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Remarkably, the excellent activity of RuSn SAO enables it to be the best catalyst for IOR toward energy-saving hydrogen production. Its two-electrode acidic electrolyzer requires a cell voltage of only 1.07 V to afford 10 mA cm(-2), which is 0.51 V less than that required for OER to reach the same current density. Thus, the system drastically reduces energy consumption by more than 40% compared to pure water electrolysis. The chronopotentiometric test shows that the RuSn SAO needed a super-low overpotential increase of Delta eta = 70 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) together with recorded highly durable stability in the acidic electrolyte, indicating enhanced catalytic activity. Furthermore, this strategy simultaneously produces hydrogen with similar to 100% Faradic efficiency and a high-value commodity chemical, I-2, making H-2 production potentially costless. Thus, the proposed concept paves a new way to facilitate the realization of hydrogen economics.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			2168-0485			WOS:000671060400014

The accent is put on the dissolution of the state-of-the-art oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) Pt- and Ir-or Ru-based catalysts, respectively. Two important aspects at the cutting edge of the ORR and OER catalyst stability research, viz. stability of the catalyst layers containing very small loadings of Pt and Ir/Ru and the question of the conformity of the model dissolution studies with degradation of the "real world" catalyst layers are highlighted. It is shown that in both systems catalyst degradation accelerates with decrease in catalyst loading. Situation is more complex though, when model and real systems are contrasted. Thus, while dissolution of Pt is comparable, no convincing comparison for Ir/Ru can be provided yet. The potential near future research directions are emphasized throughout the text.									50	0	0	0	2	0	50			2451-9103			WOS:000442793300019

The oxygep electrode has long been one of the primary limiting factors of reversible AMFCs due to the sluggish kinetics of the oxygen reduction and evolution reactions (ORR and OER, respectively). It is challenging to develop durable and efficient bifunctional ORR/OER electrocatalysts; in particular, few researchers have focused on the durability of the material, which is the most relevant aspect for industrial application of these catalysts. In this work, we present an optimized procedure producing a highly stable bifunctional hybrid catalyst with excellent ORR/OER activities. This catalyst comprises covalently-bonded hybrid structures of cobalt oxide nanocrystals decorated on pre-oxidized carbon nanotubes. We performed the durability test in a broad potential range, from 0.0V to 1.9 V (vs. RHE), which is a harsh condition under which to our knowledge no previous hybrid structure in literature has survived. We have also linked the catalyst durability to metal oxide anchoring sites and its synthesis parameters. This study provides novel perspectives for the design of carbon-based, hybrid materials and insight into the synthesis-property, relationships for the next-generation electrocatalysts.

However, its catalytic impact on transition-metal oxide thin films, such as perovskites, is not widely understood. Here, we epitaxially strain the conducting perovskite LaNiO3 to systematically determine its influence on both the oxygen reduction and oxygen evolution reaction. Uniquely, we found that compressive strain could significantly enhance both reactions, yielding a bifunctional catalyst that surpasses the performance of noble metals' such as Pt. We attribute the improved bifunctionality to strain induced splitting of the e(g) Orbitals, which can customize orbital asymmetry at the surface. Analogous to strain induced shifts in the d-band center of noble metals relative to the Fermi level, :such splitting can dramatically affect catalytic activity in this perovskite and other potentially more active Oxides.									234	9	0	0	17	0	236			0002-7863			WOS:000371453700007	26866808

Herein, Ni and WC (Tungsten Carbide) nanoparticles embedded in carbon nanofibers (Ni-WC/CNFs) electrocatalysts were successfully synthesized by electrospinning followed by subsequent carbonization process. The morphology and composition of the Ni-WC/CNFs composite were characterized by using SEM and XRD analysis. Ni and WC nanoparticles were successfully uniformly dispersed on carbon nanofibers (CNFs). The Ni-WC/CNFs electrocatalysts exhibit excellent electrocatalytic activity towards OER and HER in 1.0 M KOH solutions. The experimental results show that the OER and HER overpotentials of Ni-WC/CNFs are 350 mV and 190 mV respectively when the current density is 10 mA cm-2. The excellent electrocatalytic properties of OER and HER are attributed to the synergistic effect between Ni and WC nanoparticles and the large electrochemically active surface area.

As an important 3D class of porous materials, Metal organic frameworks (MOF) with designable topological structures and compositions have been used as templates to obtain diverse functional materials. In this paper, ZnCo2O4@ C-MWCNTs has been successfully synthesized by embedding dual-MOF into MWCNTs followed by calcinations under N-2 and air atmosphere in turn. The ZnCo2O4@ C-MWCNTs hybrid exhibits enhanced OER performance in terms of an onset potential (1.45 V vs. RHE) and a low overpotential (327 mV) at 10 mA cm(-2). It is noteworthy that the potentials of ZnCo2O4@ C-MWCNTs remain almost constant for 25 h in alkaline solution. Compared with many MOF derived matrix for OER applications, in-situ carbon formed during calcination process under N-2 atmosphere can not only improve the material's conductivity, but also prevent the agglomeration of active nanoparticles. The design concept of dual-MOFs-doped MWCNTs can be significantly expanded to fabricate other novel and stable catalysts for a wide range of applications. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

So, the CO bubble evolution rate constant, k(Ch), and the super-saturation pressure, P(CO)*, for the CO bubble evolution were taken into consideration in a decarburization reaction model. The decarburization behaviors were simulated successfully by the reaction model.3) The value of k(Ch) increased with the increase in the Ar injection flow rate, and the value of P(CO)* was estimated to be 22.5-25.0 mmHg.4) In the pressure decreasing stage, the decarburization reaction was divided into three types, namely, a) an evacuating control, b) a stirring control and c) a mixed control of evacuating and stirring. In order to increase the decarburization rate, it is essential to keep a high oxygen content, to evacuate fast and to supply enough stirring to a molten steel according to the evacuating rate.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			0021-1575			WOS:A1994NU83700006

The corrosion-resistant GDL comprised of a conventional carbon substrate and a protective micro-porous layer (MPL) of iridium-titanium nitride (Ir-TiN). Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images revealed uniform distribution of Pt and Ir nanoparticles on the TiO(2) support with particle sizes of 4.5 and 2.0 nm, respectively, which was also confirmed by the XRD analysis. Among the various Pt-Ir compositions prepared, Pt(85)Ir(15) (with a Pt/Ir weight ratio of 85/15) showed the highest catalyst efficiency towards oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The URFC testing results showed that the round-trip energy conversion efficiency (epsilon(RT)) of supported Pt-Ir/TiO(2) (42%) was significantly higher than that of unsupported Pt-Ir black (30%). The TiO(2) support provided high surface area for the uniform dispersion of the catalyst particles. The URFC performance increase was ascribed to the uniform dispersion and better utilization of noble metal catalysts. Furthermore, the stability of URFC cycle performance was significantly improved by using Ir-TiN as an additional protective MPL mainly due to reduced carbon corrosion of the GDL especially during water electrolysis.

We review recent progress in the preparation of oxides for bifunctional oxygen reduction/evolution applications (ORR/OER) and include a summary of benchmark performances achieved over the past 3 years. Parallel and complementary progress on development of activity descriptors for the OER in oxides is also covered; special attention is dedicated to synergistic effects and the importance of support choice and oxide/support interactions to maximize activity and ensure stability. Finally, exciting mechanistic insights on OER and bifunctional ORR/OER oxide catalysis gained from recent in situ and operando X-ray experiments from the recent literature are discussed.									25	0	0	0	0	0	25			2451-9103			WOS:000433581100031

Here we report a universal, controlled scalable arc-discharge method to produce Ni/NiO nanoparticles encapsulated in graphene as multifunctional catalysts for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), urea oxidation reaction (UOR) and 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) oxidation reaction. We find that the catalytic activity of Ni/NiO@graphene can be altered dramatically by the electronic structure of the graphene layer which can be tuned by introducing oxygen dopants through a post-annealing process. Due to the synergistic effect of Ni nanoparticles, Ni/NiO heterostructures and the oxygen-doped graphene layer, the as-prepared catalysts show superior catalytic activity for the HER and UOR. The overall electrochemical water splitting in alkaline electrolyte with urea only requires 1.46 V. Moreover, the as-fabricated composites can catalyze the HMF oxidation reaction efficiently. This work provides a viable strategy to solve the energy challenge.									20	0	0	0	1	0	20			2044-4753	2044-4761		WOS:000639998200012

The careful choice of the synthesis method and experimental conditions allow for the tailoring of the film nanostructure and surface area. We have prepared various spinel oxides, FeyCux-yCO3-xO4 and FeyNix-yCo3-xO4 (for y = 0.1 or 0.15 and x = 1 or 0.5 for both Fe-Cu and Fe-Ni containing oxides), using the thermal decomposition method. The films were analyzed using several structural, chemical and electrochemical methods such as X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), cyclic voltammetry (CV) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The SEM analysis of FeyCux-yCO3-xO4 electrodes shows that surface is covered with grains, while the surface of FeyNix-yCo3-xO4 appears smoother and more compact. For all our compositions, the X-ray data support the existence of the spinel structure. XPS measurements were performed to study the cation distribution and surface chemical composition of the electrodes, both survey spectra and core level spectra were recorded. The high-resolution spectra for the Co, Cu and Ni 2p peaks indicate the existence of different Co2+/Co3+, Cu+/Cu2+ and Ni2+/Ni3+ ratio for these materials (note that the Fe signal was often too small in the XPS spectra to yield meaningful results). The analysis of O 1s spectra indicate that the main peak is composed of three components that can be assigned to lattice oxygen, adsorbed oxygen containing species such as hydroxides and surface bonded water. Electrochemical measurements show that when the current is corrected for the real surface area, FeyCux-yCo3-xO4 and FeyNix-yCO3-xO4 show significant enhancement with almost double the current density for the oxygen evolution reaction at 1 V under the same conditions compared to Co3O4. Fe has some synergic effect with Ni, Cu and Co, which promote the catalytic activity. A suitable combination of metal cations in the spinel structure could markedly enhance current density and thus, chemical composition plays a crucial role in the electrocatalytic activity of the materials for oxygen evolution reaction.

Herein, the sponge-like unadulterated carbontube-graphene complexes (D/G-CTs-1,000) with multifarious intrinsic defect active sites are fabricated by boric acid-hydrothermal and pyrolysis treatments. The close contact or juncture between open nanotubes and few-layer graphene in D/G-CTs-1,000 constructs the hierarchical networks with plentiful channels, the larger surface area and outstanding conductivity. As a result, the as-prepared D/G-CTs-1,000 electrocatalyst exhibits an excellent trifunctional electrocatalytic performance for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). The primary Zn-air batteries and overall water splitting system using D/G-CTs-1,000 as the electrode materials delivers higher power density outperforming the advanced Pt/C-based batteries and the overall water splitting performance comparable to those using the non-precious metal/carbon-based materials as electrode. This work provides a universal and efficient synthetic strategy to produce the unadulterated carbons with high activity and long-time durability as trifunctional electrocatalysts and promote the widespread applications of metal-free electrocatalysts in sustainable energy conversion technology.									20	4	0	0	0	0	20			1998-0124	1998-0000		WOS:000515619800002

Herein, a three-dimensional (3D), heterogeneous nano-architecture composed of a mixture of CoP, Co2P, and Co3O4 is fabricated via LiCl-assisted thermal phosphidation of porous Co3O4. Thanks to the combination of heterojunction and 3D nano-network which facilitates the mass/charge transport and the spatial redistribution of electron, the resultant electrocatalyst exhibits prominent activities toward the ORR, OER and HER, surpassing most of the previously reported trifunctional electrocatalysts. Notably, the Zn-air battery with CoP/Co2P/Co3O4 as the air cathode exhibits superior efficiency and durability, comparable to those of the apparatus based on the state-of-the-art Pt/C//RuO2. Moreover, the electrolyzer using CoP/Co2P/Co3O4 as both the anodic and cathodic electrodes, requires a potential as low as similar to 1.87 V to drive a current density of 200 mA cm(-2) for overall water splitting. This well-defined nano-heterogeneous network-based catalyst can offer some interesting prospects for the design concept of outstanding multifunctional catalysts toward various energy conversion and storage devices.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1144-0546	1369-9261		WOS:000784942200001

An overpotential of 320 and 630 mV was required to achieve 10 mA cm(-2) for OER and HER, respectively. The overpotential for OER of this CoSe4-containing complex is one of the lowest that has been observed until now for molecular cobalt(II) systems, under the reported conditions. In addition, this cobalt-seleno-based complex exhibits a high mass activity (14.15 A g(-1)) and a much higher turn-over frequency (TOF) value (0.032 s(-1)) at an overpotential of 300 mV. These observations confirm analogous ones already reported in the literature pertaining to the potential of molecular cobalt-seleno systems as efficient OER electrocatalysts.									4	0	0	0	1	0	4				1420-3049		WOS:000624165300001	33579044

Hydrogen evolution reaction, oxygen reduction reaction as well as CO2 and N-2 electrochemical reduction to form methane and ammonia are taken as examples. Calculations of reaction rates based on the estimation of the activation energy of elementary steps from minimum energy paths and transition state theory have been shown to provide accurate estimates of rates even for complex reactions and competing reaction mechanisms.

However, the sluggish and strong irreversible nature of the oxygen electrochemical kinetics makes it difficult to manufacture single bifunctional material. Therefore, we prepared a bifunctional catalyst (Co3O4/N-rGO) with different particle diameters through a one-pot synthesis method, and studied the dependence of the electrocatalytic performance of the catalyst on the particle size of Co3O4. The results showed that Co3O4/N-rGO with 27-31 nm particle size prepared by using N-rGO as the carrier, cobalt acetate concentration of 0.075 M, hydrothermal temperature of 190 degrees C, and hydrothermal time of 3 h takes a 4e-reaction pathway, which exhibited better ORR and OER activity, excellent current stability and methanol tolerance than JM 20% Pt/C and JM 5% RuO2/C.[GRAPHICS].									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			0021-891X	1572-8838		WOS:000572878600004

Herein, we propose a rational linker scission approach to induce lattice strain in metal-organic framework (MOF) catalysts by partially replacing multicoordinating linkers with nonbridging ligands. Strained NiFe-MOFs with 6% lattice expansion exhibit a superior catalytic performance for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) under alkaline conditions; the overpotential is reduced to 230 mV (86.6 mV dec(-1)) from 320 mV (164.9 mV dec(-1)) for the unstrained NiFe-MOFs at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2). Operando studies by using synchrotron radiation X-ray absorption and infrared spectroscopy identified the emergence of a key *OOH intermediate on sites during OER, providing strong evidence that the Ni3+/4+ sites are the active sites and the formation of *OOH is the rate-limiting step. The first-principles calculations were performed to reveal the strain-induced electronic structure changes of the NiFe-MOFs and the Gibbs free energy profile during OER It is found that the optimized Ni 3d eg-orbital facilitates the formation of *OOH, thus enhancing the OER performance of the strained MOFs.									57	3	0	0	0	0	57			2155-5435			WOS:000535291500032

However, the curvature relaxation (kappa R) and Time-of-Flight Secondary Ion Mass Spectroscopy (ToF-SIMS) analyses performed here on Pulsed Laser Deposited thin films of the oxygen exchange catalyst Pr0.1Ce0.9O2-x (PCO) show that unpolarized platinum current collectors dramatically improve the k(chem) of Si-contaminated PCO by reducing the Si concentration at the PCO surface and/or diffusing into the PCO; even for PCO thin films only exposed to mild temperatures of 500 degrees C. This suggests that precious metal current collectors are likely responsible for some of the large k(chem) variation reported in the literature for "identical" materials tested under "identical" conditions.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000713403900001

Recently, core-shell structures have attracted plenty of attention in the field of sustainable and affordable energy conversion and storage. In this research, we have prepared a hierarchical structure of nickel hydroxide (Ni(OH)(2)) coated on CoMn layered double hydroxide (CoMn-LDH) nanowires (labeled as Ni(OH)(2)@CoMn-LDH) as an oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrocatalyst. This as-prepared Ni(OH)(2)@CoMn-LDH/NF electrode exhibits excellent oxygen evolution reaction (OER) performance with a lower overpotential of 250 and 341 mV at a current density of 30 and 100 mA cm(-2) respectively (without iR-correction) along with a lower Tafel slope of 102 mV dec(-1). In addition, Ni(OH)(2)@CoMn-LDH/NF remains stable for more than 25 h in 1 M KOH electrolyte. The outstanding OER behavior was ascribed to the ultrathin Ni(OH)(2) coating deposited on conducting CoMn-LDH, which provides strong active sites with sufficient channels for electron transfer.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			1144-0546	1369-9261		WOS:000740744300001

Herein, PtIr multipods with a low Lewis acidity of the Pt atoms are reported as an advanced cathode for improving overpotentials and stabilities. DFT calculations disclose that electrons have a strong disposition to transfer from Ir to Pt, since Pt has a higher electronegativity than Ir, resulting in a lower Lewis acidity of the Pt atoms than that on the pure Pt surface. The low Lewis acidity of Pt atoms on the PtIr surface entails a high electron density and a down-shifting of the d-band center, thereby weakening the binding energy towards intermediates (LiO2), which is the key in achieving low oxygen-reduction-reaction (ORR) and oxygen-evolution-reaction (OER) overpotentials. The Li-O-2 cell based on PtIr electrodes exhibits a very low overall discharge/charge overpotential (0.44 V) and an excellent cycle life (180 cycles), outperforming the bulk of reported noble-metal-based cathodes.									16	0	0	0	0	0	16			1433-7851	1521-3773		WOS:000726888700031	34719865

Herein, based on the integrated design of chemical composition and geometric structure, Fe-doped CoO nanotubes (NTs) with high OER activity are prepared by a facile template-free approach. The construction of this tubular structure is realized via a simple wet-chemical reaction to prepare solid nanorods as precursor and a subsequent calcination treatment of the precursor to form hollow cavity. The favorable composition and unique hollow structure endow these Fe-doped CoO NTs with remarkable activity toward OER. When used as the electrocatalyst for OER, the Fe-doped CoO NTs show a small overpotential of 282 mV at the current density of 10 mA cm(-2), a low Tafel slope of 78.26 mV dec(-1), and a high turnover frequency of 0.0965 s(-1) at the overpotential of 282 mV, which is superior to those of CoO NTs and solid CoO nanoparticles. Moreover, the Fe-doped CoO NTs also exhibit excellent long-term stability of 24 h at the current density of 10 mA cm(-2).									4	0	0	0	0	0	4				2688-4062		WOS:000754946700001

By the electrochemical measurements, the optimum performance in electrocatalytic activity for oxygen evolution reaction in alkaline media was obtained on the Co + Ni mixed oxide deposited from the solution containing Co2+/Ni2+ ratio of 1:1. The mixed oxide is corresponding to about 68 at% Co contents with spinel-type NiCo2O4 phase and porosity surface structure. The electrochemical kinetic parameters including exchange current density, Tafel slopes, reaction order with respect to [OH-] and standard electrochemical enthalpy of activation were analyzed also. A possible mechanism involving the formation of a physisorbed hydrogen peroxide intermediate in a slow electrochemical step was presented, which accounts for the values of the experimental results.

Electrocatalytic activities of Pd-Ni nanoparticles obtained on multiwalled carbon nanotubes towards oxygen evolution in 1M KOH								INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ELECTROCHEMICAL SCIENCE				3	4			416	426						APR 2008	2008	Pd and Pd-Ni nanoparticles were synthesized on the surface of a new catalytic support, modified multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs), by chemical precipitation method at 90 0 C and their physicochemical and electrocatalytic properties towards oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in 1M KOH have been investigated using transmission electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, cyclic and steady state voltammetries. It is observed that introduction of Ni from 0.6 to 1.7 wt% increases the electrocatalytic activity for the OER of the base metal (Pd) attached to the surface of MWCNTs (C) showing the greatest activity with 1.1 wt% Ni (i. e., PdNi0.5/C). At E = 0.55 V vs. SCE in 1M KOH at 25 0 C, the apparent electrocatalytic activity of the PdNi0.5/C (1.1 wt%) electrode(similar to 45 mAcm(-2)) was more than 90 times higher than that of the base Pd/C electrode (similar to 0.4 mAcm(-2)).									22	1	0	0	3	0	22			1452-3981			WOS:000256383900003

Herein, amorphous Ni1-xFex oxyhydroxide nanosheets (x: 0, 0.25, 0.50, 0.75, and 1) with integrated bulk and surface Fe were synthesized by facile electrodeposition as an active and stable electrocatalyst for OER. Different ratios of Fe and Ni precursors were deposited on nickel foam cathodically for bulk Fe (Fe-B) embodiment. Then, surface Fe (Fe-S) was integrated through anodic cycling from Fe-containing KOH. Benefiting from the amorphous structure and integration between Fe-B and Fe-S, high activity and stability were achieved. Accordingly, FeB+S-NIFE25 has demonstrated the highest OER activity, with the lowest overpotential of 300 mV at a current density of 50 mA cm(-2), a Tafel slope as low as 30 mV dec(-1), and robust stability exceeding 100 h for continuous oxygen generation while the same material (NIFE25) in the absence of FeS, has demonstrated relatively a higher overpotential of 340 mV and a Tafel slope of 65 mV dec(-1). Computation simulation also calculated that the NIFEX composites containing both Fe-B and Fe-S demonstrated weak binding energies enhancing OH- density at the reaction interface facilitating O-2 generation. It is probable that the synergy between Fe-B and FeS coupled with an amorphous structure induces higher OER activity and stability and can be readily applied to generate cheap and clean hydrogen energy.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			2574-0962			WOS:000678382900048

In this work, Fe-doping Co3N catalysts were successfully synthesized by a simple nitridation reaction of the Co3-xFexO4 precursor. This material exhibited a low overpotential of 294 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2), and a small Tafel slope of 49 mV dec(-1) in 1 M KOH solution, superior to the performance of Co3N and IrO2. As revealed by the spectroscopic and electrochemical analyses, the enhanced OER performance mainly originates from the electronic modulation induced by the incorporation of Fe into Co3N, benefitting the formation of CoOOH as active surface species and thus facilitating the OER process. These findings also demonstrate the introduction of heterogeneous element is a simple and effective strategy to regulate the OER property of the cobalt nitrides (Co-3N) catalysts.

Here, by combining experiments and first-principles 60 calculations, we demonstrate that MoS2 quantum dots (MSQDs) are efficient materials for the OER We use a simple route for the synthesis of MSQDs from 4(1 a single precursor in aqueous medium, avoiding the formation of unwanted carbon quantum dots (CQDs). The as-synthesized MSQDs exhibit higher OER activity with a lower Tafel slope in comparison to that for the state of the art catalyst IrO2/C. The potential cycling of the MSQDs activates the surface and improves the OER catalytic properties. Density functional theory calculations reveal that MSQD vertices are reactive and the vacancies at the edges also promote the reaction, which indicates that the small flakes with defects at the edges are efficient for the OER. The presence of CQDs affects the adsorption of reaction intermediates and dramatically suppresses the OER performance of the MSQDs. Our theoretical and experimental findings provide important insights into the synthesis process of MSQDs and their catalytic properties and suggest promising routes to tailoring the performance of the catalysts for OER applications.									149	1	0	0	15	0	148			2155-5435			WOS:000426804100008

Herein, a highly active OER catalyst, Fe0.3Ni0.7OX supported on oxygen-functionalized multi-walled carbon nanotubes, is substantially activated into a bifunctional ORR/OER catalyst by means of additional incorporation of MnOX. The carbon nanotube-supported trimetallic (Mn-Ni-Fe) oxide catalyst achieves remarkably low ORR and OER overpotentials with a low reversible ORR/OER overvoltage of only 0.73 V, as well as selective reduction of O-2 predominantly to OH-. It is shown by means of rotating disk electrode and rotating ring disk electrode voltammetry that the combination of earth-abundant transition metal oxides leads to strong synergistic interactions modulating catalytic activity. The applicability of the prepared catalyst for reversible ORR/OER electrocatalysis is evaluated by means of a four-electrode configuration cell assembly comprising an integrated two-layer bifunctional ORR/OER electrode system with the individual layers dedicated for the ORR and the OER to prevent deactivation of the ORR activity as commonly observed in single-layer bifunctional ORR/OER electrodes after OER polarization.									131	2	0	0	3	0	131			1616-301X	1616-3028		WOS:000496335700001

Because of their stability and abundance, Mn-based materials have been studied as electrocatalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), which is a more sluggish reaction in the water splitting system. To increase the OER activity of Mn, it is imperative to facilitate the structural change of Mn oxide to the active phase with Mn3+ species, known as the active site. Here, we present the relationship between the electronic conductivity in the catalyst layer and the formation of the Mn active phase, 8-MnO2, from wrinkled Mn(OH)2. Mn(OH)2 has poor conductivity, and it disrupts the oxidation reaction toward MnOOH or 8-MnO2. Adjacent conductive carbon to Mn(OH)2 enabled Mn(OH)2 to be oxidized to 8-MnO2. Furthermore, after repetitive cyclic voltammetry activation, the more conductive environment resulted in a higher density of 8-MnO2 through the irreversible phase transition, and thus it contributes to the improvement of the OER activity.

Here, a new class of multifunctional electrocatalysts consisting of dominant metallic Ni or Co with small fraction of their oxides anchored onto nitrogen-doped reduced graphene oxide (rGO) including Co-CoO/N-rGO and Ni-NiO/N-rGO are prepared via a pyrolysis of graphene oxide and cobalt or nickel salts. Ni-NiO/N-rGO shows the higher electrocatalytic activity for the OER in 0.1 M KOH with a low overpotential of 0.24 V at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2), which is superior to that of the commercial IrO2. In addition, it exhibits remarkable activity for the HER, demonstrating a low overpotential of 0.16 V at a current density of 20 mA cm(-2) in 1.0 M KOH. Apart from similar HER activity to the Ni-based catalyst, Co-CoO/N-rGO displays the higher activity for the ORR, comparable to Pt/C in zinc-air batteries. This work provides a new avenue for the development of multifunctional electrocatalysts with optimal catalytic activity by varying transition metals (Ni or Co) for these highly demanded electrochemical energy technologies.									416	23	0	0	18	0	421			1616-301X	1616-3028		WOS:000362517900009

The rational design of electrocatalysts serves as a critical point to achieve efficient water splitting. Layered double hydroxides (LDHs) with two-dimensionally (2D) layered structures hold great potential in electrocatalysis owing to their ease of preparation, structural flexibility, and tenability. However, their application in catalysis is limited due to their low activity attributed to structural stacking with irrational electronic structures, and their sluggish mass transfers. To overcome this challenge, attempts have been made toward adjusting the morphological and electronic structure using appropriate design strategies. This review highlights the current progress made on design strategies of transition metal-based LDHs (TM-LDHs) and their application as novel catalysts for oxygen evolution reactions (OERs) in alkaline conditions. We describe various strategies employed to regulate the electronic structure and composition of TM-LDHs and we discuss their influence on OER performance. Finally, significant challenges and potential research directions are put forward to promote the possible future development of these novel TM-LDHs catalysts.									11	0	0	0	2	0	11				2079-4991		WOS:000667001400001	34070272

In this study, BiOCl/sulfonated graphene (BOC/GS) composites with adequate oxygen vacancies are fabricated through a hydrothermal method and plasma modification for efficient OER. Controllable generation of oxygen vacancies in BOC/GS is achieved through adjusting the loaded plasma, which is beneficial for the enhancement of electrochemical properties such as conductivity, wettability and dissociation of adsorbates. Furthermore, band structure regulation and high response to visible light are realized in BOC/GS composites, which enables light energy compensation for the electrocatalytic OER process, resulting in reduced overpotential and fast reaction kinetics. Compared with pristine BOC/GS, the overpotential of plasma modified BOC/GS is obviously improved by 270 mV at 10 mA cm(-2)with a Tafel slope of 52 mV dec(-1). The OER mechanism is investigated from the perspective of photochemistry and electrochemistry, which provides a novel pathway for designing new efficient photo-compensated OER electrocatalysts.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			2044-4753	2044-4761		WOS:000550578100027

Herein, a Co-derived pre-catalyst that allows gradual exposure of CoOOH that acts as the active center for OER catalysis is obtained by both phosphate ion surface functionalization and Mo inner doping. The obtained catalyst reveals an excellent OER activity with a low overpotential of 265 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) and good durability in alkaline electrolyte, which is comparable to the majority of Co-based OER catalysts. Specifically, the surface functionalization produces lots of Co-PO4 species with oxygen vacancies which can trigger the surface self-reconstruction of pre-catalyst for a favorable OER reaction. Density functional theory calculations reveal that the Mo doping optimizes adsorption-free energy of *OOH formation and thus accelerates intrinsic electrocatalytic activity.

We explored the effects of Mn addition to a cobalt oxide for stabilizing the catalyst by comparing single phase CoOx and (Co0.7Mn0.3)O-x films electrodeposited in alkaline solution. The obtained disordered films were classified as layered oxides using X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS). The CoOx films showed a constant decrease in the catalytic activity during cycling, confirmed by oxygen detection, while that of (Co0.7Mn0.3)O-x remained constant within error as measured by electrochemical metrics. These trends were rationalized based on XAS analysis of the metal oxidation states, which were Co2.7+ and Mn3.7+ in the bulk and similar near the surface of (Co0.7Mn0.3)O-x, before and after cycling. Thus, Mn in (Co0.7Mn0.3)O-x successfully stabilized the bulk catalyst material and its surface activity during OER cycling. The development of stabilization approaches is essential to extend the durability of OER catalysts.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2196-0216			WOS:000824737100004	35915742

In the present work, a combined structure of Co3O4 nanoparticles and CuO microsheets was constructed in an aqueous system and studied as an efficient oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrocatalyst. NH3 molecules as the ligand of metal ions (Cu2+ and Co2+) played vital roles for the uniform growth of Co3O4@CuO microsheets. The synergetic contribution of the two components made the composite samples behave excellent OER activity and fast kinetics both on glassy carbon electrode (GCE) and nickel foam (NF) substrates in alkaline medium. The remarkable small overpotentials (310 and 394 mV) can be obtained for CuO-Co-0.2/GCE sample at current densities of 1 and 10 mA/cm(2) in 1.0 mol L-1 KOH (pH = 13.6). The in-situ deposited CuO-Co-0.2/NF achieved in the aqueous synthetic system demonstrates superior (structural and electrochemical) stability for 20 h-OER performance. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Herein, stacking faults abundant Ni2P/Co2P electrocatalysts with outstanding bifunctional oxygen evolution and hydrogen evolution property have been prepared. The stacking faults are formed by slow dissolution of Ni substrate by Mo6+ and further redeposition of Ni2+ during the growth of Co(OH)F crystals. Unprecedentedly, the distinct mechanistic etching-redeposition pathway dictated by the stacking faults, heterostructures and crystal lattice deformation leads to lattice expansion of Co2P and enables preferred reactants adsorption. Electrolysis cell employing Ni2P/Co2P electrocatalysts as a bifunctional catalyst for both the cathode and the anode delivers a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at a cell voltage of 1.57 V, which is comparable to the integrated Pt/C and IrO2 counterparts. The exceptional electrocatalytic performance of Co2P/Ni2P-x%Mo indicates the redeposition mechanism a new methodology to modulate the structure and surface reactivity of electrocatalysts.									50	2	0	0	4	0	50			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000533148700057

Herein, we propose effective and novel cerium (IV) oxide (CeO2)-induced surface chemical reconstruction strategy to optimize the OER electrocatalytic performance of inverse-spinel MnCo2O4. To reach this aim, a MnCo2O4/CeO2 heterostructure is designed and synthesized through a facile and effective zeolitic imidazolate framework (ZIF)-derived method, which not only successfully implements the surface chemical reconstruction of MnCo2O4 including: (i) the charge redistribution modulating the electronic structure and (ii) the interface reconstruction creating more oxygen vacancies, but also endows MnCo2O4/CeO2 with hierarchical hollow architecture that further extends catalytically active sites. Benefiting from the surface chemical reconstruction triggered structure and composition advantages, the as-synthesized MnCo2O4/CeO2 presents the reduced overpotentials (276 mV at 10 mA cm(-2); 390 mV at 50 mA cm(-2)), improved kinetics (87 mV dec(-1)), low activation energy (E-a = 48.8 kJ mol(-1)) and robust long-term stability, which exceeds benchmark RuO2 and single MnCo2O4 catalysts. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations validate obvious changes for the electronic structure of MnCo2O4 and the increased d-band center of active Co atom after the surface chemical reconstruction, thus optimizing the binding strength of reaction intermediates during the OER. It is believed that this work gives references to the understanding and design of highly active heterojunction electrocatalysts for water oxidation.									20	0	0	0	2	0	20			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000773066500002

Recently, fabricating SACs with rich multidimensional nanoarchitectures has become fascinating but challenging. Here, for the first time, we explore a facile and practicable "sacrificed-template" method to prepare cobalt single-atom electrocatalysts with Urchin-like Nano-Tube hierarchical structures (UNT Co SAs/N-C) derived from well-aligned metal-organic-frameworks (MOFs) superstructure (UNT ZIF-67). The as-prepared UNT Co SAs/N-C catalysts exhibit superior performance both in ORR/OER. XAFS and density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that outstanding catalytic activities stem from high-quality single-atom dispersion, precise local coordination of CoN4, and well-aligned carbon matrix based on MOFs superstructures. Our work provides new perspective in enriching SACs synthesis methodologies.									137	14	0	0	11	0	138			2211-2855	2211-3282		WOS:000471201800029

In this communication, we report a novel Cu-nanoparticle decorated CoS2 nanoneedle array on Ti mesh (Cu@CoS2/TM) as an efficient electrocatalyst for alkaline water oxidation. Benefiting from a large active surface area and a strong interfacial interaction between Cu and CoS2, Cu@CoS2/TM exhibits excellent OER performance in alkaline media with only a small overpotential of 277 mV to deliver 50 mA cm(-2). This value is 62 mV less than that of CoS2/TM. Cu@CoS2/TM achieves a high turnover rate of 0.25 mol O-2 s(-1) at 400 mV, which is approximately 1.7 times higher than that of CoS2/TM.

However, it remains a great challenge to develop highly efficient bifunctional catalysts for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Herein, we design and prepare a highly active bifunctional catalyst for ZnABs by using a cobalt metal-organic framework (Co-MOF) as the precursor. The catalyst has a desirable nanostructure composed of cobalt nanoparticles deposited on N-doped bimodal mesoporous carbon nanorods (Coc.cPN-CNR). This hybrid structure exhibits a higher catalytic activity (a maximum power density of 63 mWcm(-2)) and cycling stability compared to commercial Pt/C Ir/C integrated in ZnABs The high catalytic performance could be attributed to the unique nanostructure composed of Co@N-CNR, which incorporates the advantageous features of cobalt nanoparticles, mesoporous materials, and N-CNR towards OER and ORR. The reported advancement provides a new and efficient strategy for the development of rechargeable ZnABs.									31	3	0	0	3	0	31			2196-0216			WOS:000438339200015

Owing to their unique structural features, two-dimensional (2D) heterostructures have been regarded as promising next-generation electrocatalysts for overall water splitting. Herein, we successfully synthesized three-dimensional (3D) flower-like Co-Ni-P/MoS2 heterostructural hybrid spheres assembled from heterostructural 2D nanosheets. Benefiting from well-exposed interfaces and favorable diffusion channels, the as-prepared 3D flower-like Co-Ni-P/MoS2 heterostructural hybrid spheres manifest excellent overall water splitting performance in an alkaline solution with a low Tafel slope of 71 and 41 mV dec(-1) for oxygen and hydrogen evolution reactions, and show significantly improved long-term durability. Furthermore, the 3D flower-like Co-Ni-P/MoS2 heterostructural hybrid spheres used in both the anode and cathode show a low cell voltage of 1.53 V at a 10 mA cm(-2) current density. Using DFT calculations, we found the outstanding chemisorption of hydrogen and oxygen-containing intermediates making Co-Ni-P/MoS2 heterostructures an efficient bifunctional overall electrochemical water splitting catalyst.

However, the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), which is an important anodic half reaction, shows very slow kinetics due to the multi-step electron transfer process, which severely restricts the efficiency of energy conversion. Herein, we used a simple solvothermal method to dope iron into the cobalt-containing hydroxide precursor, and successfully prepared the Fe-doped Co-oxide electrocatalyst Co3-xFexO4-0.01. It only needs an overpotential of 294 mV to perform the OER at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2), and has a low Tafel slope of 47.3 mV dec(-1). Moreover, Co3-xFexO4-0.01 has excellent stability. There is no significant increase in the overpotential for oxygen evolution at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) after nearly 20 h. BET surface area test and XPS spectroscopy results show that Fe doping provides more mesopores and oxygen bridges, which is conducive to the construction of active sites and electronic regulation during the OER. This work can help design more bimetallic based highly active OER materials.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			1477-9226	1477-9234		WOS:000750192500001	35112674

For the first time, the nickel iron LDHs (NiFe LDHs) with hierarchical morphology and abundant defects are simultaneously constructed by one-step electro-deposition (ED) strategy with easy operation, time-saving and green chemistry. Remarkably, the morphology is elaborately tailored by changing the species of doped anions which is unique. Also, the X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) results elucidate that the Fe sites are in electron-rich state in LDHs which is revealed to enhance the catalytic activity strongly arising from the generation of oxygen vacancy. To deliver the current density of 10 mA cm(-2), the optimal NiFe LDHs require the overpotential of 128, 106 mV for OER and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), and achieve 100 mA cm(-2) at the overpotential of 237, 242 mV, respectively. As a bifunctional electrocatalyst, the NiFe LDHs exhibit the current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at a cell voltage of 1.55 V and 100 mA cm(-2) at 1.76 V, which are lower than that of most of benchmarking materials reported previously.

In this study, a partial disproportionation gallium-oxygen reaction of superoxide in (Ga2O2)(2+)2(O-2(-)) is subtly created prior to the lithium-oxygen one, in-situ growing Ga2O3 nanoparticles at cathode. The Ga2O3 induce the formation of poorly crystalline Li2O2, opposite to the conventional polycrystalline one. Benefitting from the crystallinity and morphology transformations of Li2O2, the chemical oxidation reaction kinetics between iodide redox mediators (RMs) and Li2O2 is significantly enhanced. In this regard, some issues related to RMs, for instance, the well-known Li-I-2 side reactions and shuttle effect between the residual I-3(-) and Li anode, can be predominantly suppressed. As a result, the cyclability of the LOBs are significantly improved with stable electrical energy efficiency. Our results lead to two conclusions: (1) non-lithium metal-oxygen reaction with higher thermodynamic potential than lithium-oxygen one is corroborated by theoretical calculations, which can in-situ produce nano-sized metal oxides particles at cathode, functioning surface growth of poorly crystalline Li2O2, and (2) acceleration of the reaction kinetics between the Li2O2 and the oxidized state of RMs is experimentally confirmed, which creates a new solid-soluble mixed catalytic mechanism.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			2405-8297			WOS:000685110200001

Herein, Cu-rich rhombic dodecahedral PtCu nanoframes (NFs) were obtained via a one-pot solvothermal route with L-proline and cetyltrimethylammonium chloride (CTAC) as co-structure-directing and stabilizing agents, along with OAm as the reductant. The as-prepared Pt24Cu76 NFs were identified as bifunctional catalysts for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in alkaline electrolyte. Specifically, the catalyst showed excellent catalytic activity and durability for ORR with positive half-wave potential at 0.95 V, outperforming that of commercial Pt/C (20 wt%, 0.88 V). Besides, it exhibited dramatically enhanced HER activity with the more positive potential at 10 mAcm(-2) and smaller Tafel slope (-18 mV, 52 mV dec(-1)) relative to those of Pt/C (-63 mV, 69 mV dec(-1)).

Herein, bimetallic (Fe, Co)P nanoparticles decorated in carbon nanotube network (FCP-CN) are synthesized through a facile and scalable spray drying and subsequent phosphorization process. The FCP-CN hybrid delivers excellent performance in hydrogen evolution reaction both in acidic and alkaline media, oxygen evolution reaction, and overall water splitting: it possesses an Pt-like hydrogen evolution reaction activity with an ultralow onset overpotential of 18 mV in acid; remarkably, it shows an ultrasmall Tafel slope of 38 mV dec(-1) in oxygen evolution reaction; being employed as both cathode and anode, this catalyst demonstrates promising performance of overall water splitting with high long-term stability. The performance is superior among recently reported transition-metal-based catalysts for overall water splitting. This work provides a scalable and low-cost synthesis strategy to synthesize nonprecious and multifunctional transition-metal-based catalysts with unique nanoarchitecture and outstanding catalytic performance for water splitting.									30	3	0	0	2	0	31			2168-0485			WOS:000480370500044

For example, the deposition of TiO2 onto IrO2 yielded a 9-fold increase in the OER-specific activity in 1.0 M H2SO4 (0.1 to 0.9 mA cm(ECSA)(-2) at 350 mV overpotential). The oxidation state of titanium and the potential of zero charge were also a function of the number of ALD cycles, indicating a correlation between oxidation state, potential of zero charge, and activity of the tuned electrocatalysts.									42	3	0	0	2	0	43			1754-5692	1754-5706		WOS:000457194500025	33312227

However, in order for them to be commercially viable, effective, stable and low-cost electrocatalysts are needed for the Oxygen Reduction Reaction (ORR) at the cathode. In this contribution, on the basis of Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations, we show that graphitic materials with active sites composed of 4 nitrogen atoms and transition metal atoms belonging to groups 7 to 9 in the periodic table are active towards ORR, and also towards Oxygen Evolution Reaction (OER). Spin analyses suggest that the oxidation state of those elements in the active sites should in general be +2. Moreover, our results verify that the adsorption behavior of transition metals is not intrinsic, since it can be severely altered by changes in the local geometry of the active site, the chemical nature of the nearest neighbors, and the oxidation states. Nonetheless, we find that these catalysts trend-wise behave as oxides and that their catalytic activity is limited by exactly the same universal scaling relations.									344	14	0	0	17	0	346			1463-9076	1463-9084		WOS:000293900400033	21796295

Herein, we reported a synergistic strategy of effectively combining hetero-atom doping and oxygen vacancy in the La-doped RuO2 nanocrystals, successfully realized by a hydrothermal and followed annealing process aiming for efficiently overall water splitting. The as-obtained La-doped RuO(2 )nanocrystals demonstrate superior electrocatalytic performances with ultra-low overpotential of 208 mV for OER and 71 mV for HER at the current density of 10 mA/cm(2) together with robust long-term stability in 0.5 M H2SO4 electrolyte, which are 222 and 15 mV lower in overpotentials than that of bare RuO2 electrocatalyst. Moreover, the La-doped RuO2 nanocrystals only require a cell voltage of 1.53 V to drive the overall water splitting reaction and exhibit a remarkable stability. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations further reveal that the synergistic effect of La doping and oxygen vacancy engineering could tune the d-band center of Ru active sites and optimize the Gibbs free energy of intermediate state, thus enhancing the activity of RuO2. Such synergistic strategy of aliovalent doping and vacancy engineering for much enhanced acid electrocatalysis may offer important referential values for exploring efficient electrocatalysts towards overall water splitting in acidic media.									6	0	0	0	1	0	6			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000783211100002

Due to the harsh reaction conditions and sluggish kinetics of the four-electron transfer involved oxygen evolution reaction (OER) at the anode, precious metal Ir-based electrocatalysts are necessary to enable active and durable acidic water electrolysis. However, the high price and scarcity of Ir spur intensive research on designing robust OER catalysts with decreased Ir loading. In this review, we provide a systematic review on the recent development of Ir-based OER catalysts, initiated with understanding of the reaction mechanism and the degradation process. Particularly, the adsorbate evolution mechanism (AEM) and lattice oxygen participation mechanism (LOM) are discussed in detail, which then serve as guiding principles for catalyst design. Second, the latest progress of Ir-based catalysts in terms of morphology engineering, heteroatom doping and controllable crystal phase design is summarized, with the real world performance of OER electrocatalysts in practical electrolyzers provided. Finally, we put forward our perspective of challenges and prospects for future development of Ir-based OER catalysts.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000810628200001

Surgical masks commonly used for COVID 19 protection by stopping aerosol and droplets have been widely used, and their disposal is critical and often not properly pursued. This work intended to transform surgical masks into platinum group metal-free electrocatalysts for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) as well as into crude oil. Surgical masks were subjected to controlled-temperature and -atmosphere pyrolysis, and the produced char was then converted into electrocatalysts by functionalizing it with metal phthalocyanine of interest. The electrocatalytic performance characterization towards ORR and HER was carried out highlighting promising activity. At different temperatures, condensable oil fractions were acquired and thoroughly analyzed. Transformation of waste surgical masks into electrocatalysts and crude oil can open new routes for the conversion of waste into valuable products within the core of the circular economy.									5	0	0	0	1	0	5			1864-5631	1864-564X		WOS:000728412100001	34889066

However, the four-electron mechanism results in slow reaction kinetics, which needed to be accelerated by efficient catalysts. Herein, a hybrid catalyst of novel nickel-iron layered double hydroxide (NiFe LDH) on porous indium tin oxide (ITO) is presented to lower the overpotential of the OER. The as-prepared NiFe LDH@ITO catalyst showed superior catalytic activity toward the OER with an overpotential of only 240 mV at a current density of 10 mA/cm(2). The catalyst also offered high stability with almost no activity decay after more than 200 h of chronopotentiometry test. Furthermore, the applications of NiFe LDH@ITO in (flexible) rechargeable zinc-air batteries exhibited a better performance than commercial RuO2 and can remain stable in cycling tests. It is supposed that the superior catalytic behavior originates from the ITO conductive framework, which prevents the agglomeration and facilitates the electron transfer during the OER process.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000710924900042	34628856

This hybrid catalyst possesses outstanding oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activity through a four-electron transfer process. Most importantly, the ORR activity of this material is superior to Pt/C catalyst, better stability and fuel (methanol and CO) tolerance than Pt/C catalyst. Besides, the Co-N-C@3D HPG also exhibits outstanding electrocatalytic performance as an efficient hydrogen evolution reaction catalyst with zero onset overpotential, low overpotential at large current density, small Tafel slope, high exchange current density, and excellent durability. It is worth noting that this outstanding bifunctional catalyst is prepared by a novel resin-based self-assembly growth methodology at large-scale.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			2196-7350			WOS:000453864000011

Because of this, tremendous efforts have been devoted to the search for efficient electrocatalysts to reduce the overpotential and increase the selectivity of electrochemical reactions. Of the various approaches, electrochemical tuning is seen as a promising technique to controllably tune the properties of catalytic materials under mild conditions. Based on this, this review will present representative electrochemical tuning methodologies involving insertion and conversion reactions in batteries as well as in situ electrode modulation during electrocatalysis processes. This review will first provide an introduction of electrochemical tuning strategies from the perspective of reactions and devices. Subsequently, this review will present comprehensive discussions on recent advancements in the modulation of various electrocatalyst properties, including electronic structure, crystalline phase, lattice strain and dimensional size, all of which significantly impact corresponding intrinsic activity and active site exposure. This review will also highlight the merits, challenges and issues of electrochemical tuning and propose promising directions in the exploration of corresponding methods in the design and enhancement of electrocatalysts for future energy applications.									14	1	0	0	1	0	14			2520-8489	2520-8136		WOS:000604729000001

However, the poor electrocatalytic activity still remains a huge challenge. Herein, we demonstrate a feasible approach through oxidation of CoFe layered double hydroxide (CoFe-LDH) to synthesize Fe-doped Co3O4@C nanoparticles with size of about 30-50 nm. As OER catalyst, the as-synthesized Fe-doped Co3O4@C nanoparticles exhibited superior OER performance with a small overpotential of 260 mV at the current density of 20 mA cm(-2), a small Tafel slope of 70 mV dec(-1) and long-term durability (there was no obviously OER current density degradation for 100 h) in alkaline solution. The present work opens a new avenue to the exploration of cost-effective and excellent electrocatalysts based on transition metal oxide materials to substitute precious metal materials for water splitting.

Herein, well-designed CoP/Ni2P nanoparticles encapsulated in a nitrogen-doped carbon matrix (named as CoP/Ni2P@NC), derived from an organic-inorganic metal phosphonate precursor, can not only efficiently catalyze the hydrogen evolution reaction at all-pH ranges, but also exhibit outstanding activities for oxygen evolution and oxygen reduction reaction in an alkaline environment. When CoP/Ni2P@NC was used as both anode and cathode electrocatalysts for overall water splitting, a low cell voltage of 1.60 V was sufficient to drive a current density of 10 mA cm(-2). When employed as an air-cathode for rechargeable Zn-air batteries, CoP/Ni2P@NC shows a high peak power density of 77 mW cm(-2) and a long-term cycle life of 100 cycles. The remarkable electrocatalytic performance arises from the inherent catalytic activity of CoP/Ni2P, the unique N-doped core-shell structure and the strong synergistic interactions among CoP, Ni2P and N-doped carbon. This work is expected to inspire the design of advanced, multifunctional and performance-oriented organic-inorganic metal phosphonate-derived catalysts for sustainable energy conversion technologies.									36	7	0	0	0	0	36				2052-1537		WOS:000493071600017

In this work, the electrocatalytic performance of transition metals and oxygen (TM/O) codecorated graphene is evaluated by density functional theory calculations. The outstanding NiO2-pen moiety (a NiO2C2 structure with O atoms in the pentatomic ring) is screened out due to its low overpotential and good stability. Furthermore, the results indicate that the catalytic activity of TM/O sites is inversely correlated with the binding energy E-b. The enhanced E-b weakens the adsorption ability and decreases the corresponding overpotentials. Our finding provides a rational strategy to design functional carbonbased electrocatalysts.									17	0	0	0	0	0	17			2574-0962			WOS:000510104700032

Narrow optical band gaps and high overpotentials are limiting the development of photoelectrocatalysts. In this study, a series of Co1-(x+y)FexMnyWO4 solid solutions of cobalt tungstate codoped with iron and manganese have been synthesized hydrothermally. The synthesized solid solutions have been characterized by powder XRD, UV-visible spectra, cyclic voltammetry (CV), and linear sweep voltammetry (LSV). They all crystallize in a wolframite-type monoclinic crystal system with space group P2/c. Doping of iron and manganese leads to narrowing of the optical band gap of Co1-(x+y)FexMnyWO4 from 2.60 to 2.04 eV. The electrocatalytic activity toward oxygen evolution reaction of all of the samples has been evaluated through LSV measurements. It is found that the sample named CS, which is codoped with manganese and iron, has the lowest onset potential and needs the lowest overpotential to attain the targeted 5 mA cm(-2) and standard 10 mA cm(-2) current densities as compared with all other synthesized samples. This study shows that the synthesized tungstates can be good candidates for the photoelectrocatalytic oxygen evolution reaction.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			2470-1343			WOS:000634542300011	33778246

Here, the new core-shell NiFe@ N-graphite electrocatalysts with excellent electrocatalytic activity and stability toward OER and ORR are reported and the Ni0.5Fe0.5@ N-graphite electrocatalyst is applied as the air electrode in Zn-air batteries. The respective liquid Zn-air battery shows a large open-circuit potential of 1.482 V and a small charge-discharge voltage gap of 0.12 V at 10 mA cm(-2), together with excellent cycling stability even after 40 h at 20 mA cm(-2). Interestingly, the all-solid-like Zn-air battery thus derived shows a highly desired mechanical flexibility, whereby little change is observed in the voltage when bent into different angles. Using the same Ni0.5Fe0.5@ N-graphite electrode, a self-driven water-splitting device, which is powered by two Zn-air batteries in-series, is constructed. The present study opens a new opportunity for the rational design of metal@N-graphite-based catalysts of core-shell structures for electrochemical catalysts and renewable energy applications.									132	14	0	0	3	0	132			1616-301X	1616-3028		WOS:000429410400024

Physical chemistry chemical physics : PCCP				13	12			5264	70		10.1039/c0cp02408b				2011-Mar-28	2011	Photoelectrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (PEIS) has been used to characterize the kinetics of electron transfer and recombination taking place during oxygen evolution at illuminated polycrystalline alpha-Fe(2)O(3) electrodes prepared by aerosol-assisted chemical vapour deposition from a ferrocene precursor. The PEIS results were analysed using a phenomenological approach since the mechanism of the oxygen evolution reaction is not known a priori. The results indicate that the photocurrent onset potential is strongly affected by Fermi level pinning since the rate constant for surface recombination is almost constant in this potential region. The phenomenological rate constant for electron transfer was found to increase with potential, suggesting that the potential drop in the Helmholtz layer influences the activation energy for the oxygen evolution process. The PEIS analysis also shows that the limiting factor determining the performance of the alpha-Fe(2)O(3) photoanode is electron-hole recombination in the bulk of the oxide.									6	1	0	0	0	0	6				1463-9084		MEDLINE:21229167	21229167

Here, the nature of cytomembrane having the most effective and functional surface structure is mimicked to fabricate a new configuration of Ni-N-O porous interface nanoparticles (NiNO INPs) with strongly interacting nanointerface between the Ni3N and NiO domains, for enhancing the electrocatalytic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) performance. The combination of transmission electron microscopy and electrochemical investigations, tracking the correlation between microstructure evolution and catalytic activity, demonstrate the strongly coupled nanointerface for an approximately sixfold improvement of electrolytic efficiency. Density functional theory simulates the electrocatalytic process with a maximum of 85% reduction of the energy barrier. Further investigations find that the real active site for the OER in the NiNO INPs is the strongly coupled Ni-N-O nanointerface, not the derived amorphous hydroxide, during the OER process. The determination of the correlation of constructed nanointerface with catalytic properties suggests a significant strategy toward the rational design of catalysts for efficient water electrocatalysis.									89	4	0	0	4	0	89			0935-9648	1521-4095		WOS:000445327500024	30133002

However, the catalytic activity of LDHs is normally limited by their poor electronic conductivity and low electrochemical active areas. Herein, a novel sputtering-painting-alloying-dealloying strategy is reported to synthesize CoGa LDH anchored on stainless steel mesh (CoGa LDH/stainless steel mesh, SSM), in which abundant oxygen vacancies are introduced into the ultrathin CoGa LDH nanosheets. Owing to the unique painting-like operation, the nanosheet-decorated CoGa LDH/SSM electrode can be fabricated on a large scale (8 x 8 cm(2) for instance), and possesses excellent flexibility and self-supported feature. Free of any conducting/binder agents, the CoGa LDH/SSM electrode shows excellent electrocatalytic activity toward OER in an alkaline solution (low overpotential of 258 mV @ 10 mA cm(-2), small Tafel slope of 34.1 mV dec(-1), long-term stability of 70 h), which is superior to that of state-of-the-art Co-based electrocatalysts. More importantly, the electrode needs only an overpotential of 198 mV to reach 10 mA cm(-2) at 335 K. The OER performance of CoGa LDH/SSM can be rationalized by numerous oxygen vacancies, ultrathin nanosheet morphology, self-supported nature, and low activation energy barrier.									29	2	0	0	2	0	30			2366-9608			WOS:000458557500002

Herein, a novel cathode plasma electrolytic deposition (CPED) technology is successfully applied to directly fabricate ternary noble metal-free FeCoNi alloys with duplex phases on 304 stainless steel substrate as self-supporting electrocatalysts for oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Effects of the CPED technical parameters on the microstructure, morphology, and electrochemical properties of ternary FeCoNi alloys are systematically investigated by a series of orthogonal experiments. The as-received FeCoNi alloy, composed of duplex phases (i.e. face-centered cubic and body-centered cubic), is found to be able to achieve a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at an overpotential of 285 mV in 1 M KOH electrolyte with a Tafel slope of 42 mV dec(-1), and long-term stability. This work provides a new way to synthesize multi-component electrocatalysts for energy storage and conversion in a large scale base for practical commercialization. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V.

The morphology, structure, and composition of the product were characterized by a series of characterization techniques, and the formation mechanism was discussed in detail. The nanocomposite exhibited improved catalytic activity for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) with the positive onset potential (E-onset, 0.91 V vs. RHE) and half-wave potential (E-1/2, 0.82 V vs. RHE), and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) with the low E-onset (-39 mV vs. RHE), overpotential (56 mV vs. RHE) at the fixed current density of 10 mA cm -2, and small Tafel slope (39 mV dec(-1)). This is ascribed to the synergistic effects of the bimetals, rGO as the good support, and electronic coupling between the Pd shell and the Pt core.									43	1	0	0	0	0	43			2168-0485			WOS:000412382700023

During depositing the MgO layer, oxygen atoms from the MgO combine with the neighboring Co atoms, leading to the formation of CoO at the Co/MgO interface. Meanwhile, the films show in-plane magnetic anisotropy (IMA). After annealing, most of the oxygen atoms in CoO migrate back to the MgO layer, resulting in obvious improvement of Co/MgO interface and the enhancement of effective Co-O orbital hybridization. These favor the evolution of magnetic anisotropy from IMA to perpendicular magnetic anisotropy (PMA). The oxygen migration effect is achieved by the redox reaction at the Co/MgO interface. On the contrary, the transfer from IMA to PMA cannot be observed in Pt/Co/Pt films due to the lack of interfacial oxygen migration.

Herein, by means of cutting edge operando surface and bulk sensitive X-ray spectroscopy techniques, specifically designed electrode nanofabrication and ab initio DFT calculations, we were able to reveal the electronic structure of the active IrOx centers (i.e., oxidation state) during electrocatalytic oxidation of water in the surface and bulk of high-performance Ir-based catalysts. We found the oxygen evolution reaction is controlled by the formation of empty Ir 5d states in the surface ascribed to the formation of formally Ir-V species leading to the appearance of electron-deficient oxygen species bound to single iridium atoms (mu(1)-O and mu(1)-OH) that are responsible for water activation and oxidation. Oxygen bound to three iridium centers (mu(3)-O) remains the dominant species in the bulk but do not participate directly in the electrocatalytic reaction, suggesting bulk oxidation is limited. In addition a high coverage of a mu(1)-OO (peroxo) species during the OER is excluded. Moreover, we provide the first photoelectron spectroscopic evidence in bulk electrolyte that the higher surface-to-bulk ratio in thinner electrodes enhances the material usage involving the precipitation of a significant part of the electrode surface and near-surface active species.									24	0	0	0	2	0	24			0002-7863	1520-5126		WOS:000686555000017	34355571

Catalysts minimized in single-atom level (SACs) anchored on two-dimensional substances are highly active for various electrocatalytic reactions, but so far represent the limited performance for OER. Herein we report a general strategy for the fabrication of bi-metal Ni and Fe SACs loaded on graphene to significantly boost the OER activity. Notably, this unique structure of single Ni and Fe atoms co-existed on graphene has a strong synergetic effect, which can substantially elevate the charge transfer of catalysts. As a result, the obtained bi-metal SACs with the appropriate ratio of 4 for single Ni and Fe atoms show a small overpotential of 247 mV at 10 mA center dot cm(-2) of OER current density in KOH electrolyte, outperforming individual-metal Ni (329 mV) or Fe (384 mV) SACs. Furthermore, such catalyst exhibits excellent stability without significant decay with increasing time at high current of 20 mA center dot cm(-2) continuously for 48 h. This work provides a new avenue for regulating the properties of transition metal SACs on graphene for water electrolysis.									16	1	0	0	1	0	16			2296-8016			WOS:000499941300001

Herein, cobalt layered double hydroxide decorated with sub-1 nm platinum clusters (Pt/Co-LDH) were synthesized for oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The integration of platinum unexpectedly induced unique nanocage structures assembled by ultra-thin LDH nanosheets via an insitu redox process. The as-prepared Pt/Co-LDH nanocages exhibit high OER activity with a low overpotential of 265 mV at 10 mA cm(-2). Experiments and density functional theory calculations indicate the high catalytic activity is mainly attributed to the strong interactions between Pt and Co-LDH, which can regulate the local coordination environment and electronic structures of cobalt. The well-defined Co-Pt - OH structures could help promote the adsorption energy of water molecules and reduce the energy barrier of rate-limiting step, benefiting from the enhanced electron transfer during the electrocatalytic process, playing the role of "electronic pump". Furthermore, the novel in-situ redox synthetic strategy also presents a facile universality to obtain metal-doped (Pt, Au, Pd) Co-LDH nanocage structures.									23	1	0	0	3	0	23			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000532683200040

Single-atom catalysts (SACs) can maximize the efficiency of metal-atom utilization, thus achieving high activity, stability, and selectivity in electrocatalytic reactions. SACs can overcome some limitations of bulk materials in electrocatalytic applications. In this review, we introduce SACs consisting of various single metal atoms, including noble and transition metals, anchored on various supports, such as metals, metal oxides, porous carbon, graphene, and g-C3N4. These catalysts possessed various binding modes between the single atoms and anchoring sites. We also review and highlight novel and promising methods to obtain SACs. Such methods include wet chemistry, metal etching, electrodeposition, and metal-organic-framework-derived methods. We also focused on the electrocatalytic applications of SACs in representative electrochemical applications such as oxygen reduction, hydrogen evolution, oxygen evolution, carbon dioxide reduction, and nitrogen reduction reactions. Significantly, the electrocatalytic performance can be tuned by engineering the structure of SACs in terms of binding mode, coordination number, and dispersion tendencies. Finally, we provide perspectives on the design of SACs for future applications in various electrocatalytic processes in energy conversion.									164	13	0	0	6	1	167			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000443116700002

Herein, a class of Ir-based alloys is reported with flower-like structure as excellent electrocatalysts both for hydrogen and oxygen generation in acid. Specially, the IrNi alloy nanoflowers (IrNi NFs) present the best hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) performance, revealed by a low Tafel slope and overpotential at current density of 10 mA cm(-2), exceeding the commercial Pt/C. It is discovered that alloying Ir with Ni can decrease the hydrogen binding energy (HBE) of Ir metal, resulting in almost 2.5 times increase in the HER intrinsic activity of IrNi NFs than Ir NFs. The IrNi NFs catalyst is also highly efficient in oxygen evolution reaction with mass activity of 379 A g(-1) Ir at 1.51 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode. Furthermore, the overall water-splitting devices using the IrNi NFs as catalysts for both cathode and anode show a low cell voltage of 1.60 V at 10 mA cm(-2) and long-term stability within 1000 cycles. This work uncovers that HBE optimization is the key of enhancing HER activity on Ir-based alloys and these Ir-based NFs hold great promise in future application in the PEMWE.									50	2	0	0	5	0	50			2366-9608			WOS:000540806600012

Although a lot of OER electrocatalysts have been developed, the actual active sites during OER have not been fully understood. Herein, we report that the distorted FeOOH/Ni hydroxide on Ni foam (NF) (d-FeOOH/Ni hydroxide-NF) shows better electrochemical performance (1.50 Vat 100 mA/ cm(2) and long-term stability for 32 h at 425 mA/cm(2)) than crystalline FeOOH/Ni hydroxide-NF (c-FeOOH/ Ni hydroxide-NF) and outperforms most of the state-of-the-art electrocatalysts. By using in-situ and ex situ techniques, we show that the interfaces in d-FeOOH/Ni hydroxide-NF, which are the key active sites for OER, are well maintained during the reaction, leading to promoted catalytic performance and longterm stability at high current density. We demonstrate that the structure rearrangement in d-FeOOH/Ni hydroxide-NF endows high flexibility of the lattice and tolerates the volume expansion during OER. Our study provides an insightful understanding on the catalytic performance of Fe-Ni-based electrocatalysts and the guidance to their design and synthesis for practical application.

In this review, recent investigations where Cr has been utilised for alkaline OER has been summarised and evaluated. The Cr-based electrocatalysts have been categorised and discussed according to their anion counterparts. From the majority of reviewed studies, Cr comes across as a beneficial co-catalyst owing to its ability to act as either an electron acceptor or electron donor. This characteristic property stems from the many possible oxidation states of Cr, with Cr3+ and Cr6+ being the most pronounced states. This review emphasises on providing a holistic view of the role Cr plays in OER electrocatalysis, focussing mainly on the correlations of activity, structure, and electronic configuration.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1867-3880	1867-3899		WOS:000810044500001

Herein, a novel hollow core-branch CoSe2 nanoarray on carbon cloth is designed by a facile selenization reaction of predesigned CoO nanocones. And the electrochemical reaction mechanism of CoSe2 in supercapacitor is studied in detail for the first time. Compared with CoO, the hollow core-branch CoSe2 has both larger specific surface area and higher electrical conductivity. When tested as a supercapacitor positive electrode, the CoSe2 delivers a high specific capacitance of 759.5 F g(-1) at 1 mA cm(-2), which is much larger than that of CoO nanocones (319.5 F g(-1)). In addition, the CoSe2 electrode exhibits excellent cycling stability in that a capacitance retention of 94.5% can be maintained after 5000 charge-discharge cycles at 5 mA cm(-2).

Herein, a core-double shell nanocubic gamma-Fe2O3@FeS2@C with energy level matching was fabricated to regulate the electrochemical electronic structure and enable efficient charge transfer at the double-interface, which could effectively reduce the OER reaction barrier and activate fast OER kinetics. Although the concept of energy level matching has been widely applied in semiconductor, it was rarely studied in OER electrocatalyst. The gamma-Fe2O3@FeS2@C catalyst displayed exceptional small overpotential (268 mV) at 10 mA/cm(2) and Tafel slope (54 mV/dec), which was superior than that of the benchmark 20 wt% Ir/C catalyst (with an overpotential of 287 mV and a Tafel slope of 71 mV/ dec). This work presented a novel approach for developing earth-abundant and highly active OER electrocatalysts based on energy level matching and phase transformations for alkaline-based water electrolysis.

These collective characteristics are essential in creating high-efficiency electrocatalysts for energy conversion and fuel generation in metal-air batteries and fuel cells. Recent years have witnessed considerable advances in rational design and controllable fabricate of COF-based electrocatalysts for oxygen reduction, oxygen evolution, hydrogen evolution, and CO2 reduction reactions. In this review, engineering strategies of COFs toward electrocatalysts are first summarized and given particular attention, highlighting their influence on intrinsic electrocatalytic performance. A systematic overview of the fundamental principles behind specific electrocatalysis reactions is then performed. Significant breakthroughs of COFs and their derivatives are presented in detail with an emphasis on the relationship between the molecular structures of COFs and their electrocatalytic performance. Lastly, current challenges and future perspectives on tailoring COFs for high-performance electrocatalysts are discussed. This review aims to identify general guidelines and the potential of COFs to outperform state-of-the-art electrocatalysts that use their noble metal-based counterparts.									92	7	0	0	5	0	94			2211-2855	2211-3282		WOS:000521052900035

Herein, we demonstrate a facile and novel strategy to prepare an amorphous N-doped cobalt borophosphate catalyst through the calcination of zeolite-type cobalt borophosphate precursor with NH3 molecule. The as prepared material displays robust catalytic activity and high stability within 18 h for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in 1.0 M KOH, e.g., an overpotential of 276 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) (eta @ 10 mA cm(-2)) and a Tafel slope of 55.8 mV dec(-1), which is comparable to that of the benchmark IrO2 electrocatalyst. Its excellent catalytic activity should be ascribed to the N-dopant which could accelerate the electron transfer by tuning the electronic structure of this borophosphate; moreover, this amorphous phase with zeolite-like porous structures could increase its active site density and improve the electron and mass transport as well as facilitating gas release. Our study not only discovers a high-efficiency OER electrocatalyst but also provides a facile and practical pathway to develop promising electrocatalysts for water splitting.									18	1	0	0	1	0	18			2168-0485			WOS:000482173100037

The analysis suggests that the surface exchange kinetics have a direct link to the acidity of the mixed conducting oxide. The possible interplay between acidity and transport properties is discussed. The analysis is also applied to oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrocatalysts but does not show a link between OER overpotentials and acidity, suggesting that the link is more relevant for gas/oxide interactions at high temperatures. The observations suggest that acidity impacts most directly the oxygen adsorption process while impacting the electron charge transfer only indirectly.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0897-4756	1520-5002		WOS:000746432100001

A rational design of trifunctional nanocarbon catalyst requires balancing the heteroatoms-doping and defect-engineering to afford desired active centers and satisfied electric conductivity, which however is conceptually challenging while desires in-depth research both experimentally and theoretically. This work reports a N,B-codoped graphitic carbon nanocage (NB-CN) with graphitic yet defect-rich characteristic as a promising trifunctional electrocatalyst through a facile thermal pyrolysis assisted in-situ catalytic graphitization (TPCG) process. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations are conducted, for the first time, to demonstrate that the best performance for ORR/OER and HER can be originated from the configuration with B meta to a pyridinic-N, which presents a minimum theoretical overpotential of 0.34 V for ORR, 0.39 V for OER, and a lowest Gibbs free-energy (Delta G(ads)) of 0.013 eV for HER. A primary zinc-air battery is assembled presenting a maximum power density of 320 mW cm(-2) along with excellent operation durability, evidencing great potential in practical applications.									175	12	0	0	7	0	177			2211-2855	2211-3282		WOS:000418344200040

The synthesis of stable, efficient, non-noble metal-based electrocatalysts for OER has been a long-standing challenge. In this work, a facile and scalable method to synthesize hollow and conductive iron-cobalt phosphide (Fe-Co-P) alloy nanostructures using an Fe-Co metal organic complex as a precursor is described. The Fe-Co-P alloy exhibits excellent OER activity with a specific current density of 10 mA/cm(2) being achieved at an overpotential as low as 252 mV. The current density at 1.5 V (vs reversible hydrogen electrode) of the Fe-Co-P catalyst is 30.7 mA/cm(2), which is more than 3 orders of magnitude greater than that obtained with state-of-the-art Fe-Co oxide catalysts. Our mechanistic experiments and theoretical analysis suggest that the electrochemical-induced high-valent iron stabilizes the cobalt in a low-valent state, leading to the simultaneous enhancement of activity and stability of the OER catalyst.									248	12	0	0	10	1	252			1936-0851	1936-086X		WOS:000423495200017	29211437

However, the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is the most challenging multi-electron and proton transfer reaction during water electrolysis for hydrogen production. The electrocatalyst is the critical component that controls the efficiency of oxygen evolution. Therefore, it is essential to explore efficient and durable electrocatalysts that must have significant efficiency compared to the benchmark catalyst (i.e., RuO2) for OER. Herein, self-supported carbon nanowires (CNWs) decorated with bimetallic palladium-cerium PdCe alloys nanoparticles (NPs) were synthesized through an electrospinning-thermal carbonation approach to overcome the kinetic barriers and deliver decent alkaline OER activity. As a result, the PdCe/CNWs requires a low overpotential of similar to 360 and similar to 450 mV vs. RHE to deliver the current density of 10 and 50 mA/cm(2) with low Tafel slope (62 mV/dec) for OER, which is even comparable to the benchmark, RuO2 (360 mV and 73 mV/ dec). Notably, only a slight increase (-10 %) in overpotential was observed after 10,000 cycles indicating high electrocatalyst stability. The high stability and improved OER performance of the PdCe/CNWs electrode can be explained by the cooperative catalytic influence between Pd, Ce, and C species.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			2468-8231			WOS:000789397400002

In this work, for the first time, Fe(OH)(3)/NiS composite nanolayers with high-performance for OER are synthesized in a controllable way at an ionic layer level. Specific amounts of NiS and Fe(OH)(3) are loaded onto coral-like CuO/Cu microarrays (c-CuO/Cu) in an easily controlled way by successive ionic layer adsorption and reaction (SILAR); the resulting OER activity depends heavily on the number of SILAR cycles. The optimized Fe(OH)(3)/NiS/c-CuO/Cu electrode exhibits a very low OER overpotential of 257 mV (vs. RHE) at 10 mA/cm(2) (with no IR compensation) in 1 M KOH and is stable toward OER for at least 10 h. We also prepared high-performance Fe(OH)(3)/Ni(OH)(2)/c-CuO/Cu OER electrocatalysts in a similar way. It is expected that this approach will be used to fabricate further semiconductor electrocatalysts for water splitting.									10	0	0	0	0	0	10			1388-2481	1873-1902		WOS:000419834400009

Here, we present a molecule-in-material integration concept based on immobilizing the polyoxometalate (POM) anion ([Co-4(H2O)(2)(PW9O34)(2)](10-)) as a molecular precursor on commercial TiO2 (P25) nanoparticles using the cationic polymer polyethylenimine (PEI) as a linking agent. The resulting composite shows promising electrocatalytic OER performance in 0.1 M aqueous KOH solution over prolonged periods (>10 h), during which a remarkable self-activation is observed, leading to a decreased OER overpotential, increased current density, and high Faradaic efficiency (91 +/- 1%). Mechanistic studies shed light on the underlying reasons for this self-activation and show that the formation of a highly active cobalt oxide and/or hydroxide catalyst and an increase in the electrocatalytically active surface area as well as electrical conductivity are the main contributing factors. The reported approach enables the scalable fabrication of POM-derived composite electrocatalysts, while self-activation could be a viable route to the more robust and more active electrocatalysts for challenging energy-conversion reactions.									9	0	0	0	0	0	9			2574-0962			WOS:000734186000005

Mixed metal sulfide, CuCo2S4, synthesised by hydrothermal method, reveals the presence of highly crystalline nanocoral sheets of CuCo2S4 with mixed oxidation states of Co and Cu ions. Electrochemical measurements show superior oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity and high exchange current density over CuCo2S4 in comparison with pristine (Co3S4 and Cu2S) and sintered CuCo2S4. In 0.5 M KOH, the nanocoral CuCo2S4 catalyst and its sintered form show a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at overpotential of 368 mV and 511 mV, respectively. A close inspection of the electrocatalytic performance in correlation with XPS spectra reveals the synergistic effect of Co and Cu ions through a redox interaction. Density Functional Theory calculations also indicate strong dependence of redox activity on redox couples as accompanied with changes in the partial charges of different constituent ions in the catalyst upon adsorption of hydroxyl ions which is a key step in OER. The study not only details sulfidebased catalytic compound for OER but also provides conclusive insights into the surface redox processes thereby providing an alternative direction to the search on novel OER catalysts.

However, the OER mechanism is highly debated, partially because of the lack of an ideal catalyst with 100% exposed active sites for unambiguous characterization. Herein, we develop an alcohol intercalation method to prepare ultrathin Ni-Fe LDH with a 1/3 unit-cell thickness and 100% exposed active sites. The ultrathin LDH catalyst exhibits an intrinsic activity similar to the bulk LDH and allows a direct and reliable characterization of the catalyst without any interference from "bulk" inactive species. Operando synchrotron X-ray analysis indicates that the metallic ions in ultrathin Ni-Fe LDH are fully oxidized into tetravalence states at low applied potentials and that the OER occurs on the tetravalent Ni and Fe ions following a decoupled proton/electron mechanism. Our findings demonstrate that a full oxidization of metal ions is crucial for highly active NiFe LDHs and that it can be accomplished by engineering ultrathin nanostructures.									107	8	0	0	5	0	109			2155-5435			WOS:000474812400024

Herein, we report porous NiO/CoN interface nanowire arrays (PINWs) with both oxygen vacancies and a strongly interconnected nanointerface between NiO and CoN domains for promoting the electrocatalytic performance and stability for OER and ORR. Extended X-ray absorption fine structure spectroscopy, electron spin resonance, and high resolution transmission electron microscopy investigations demonstrate that the decrease of the coordination number for cobalt, the enhanced oxygen vacancies on the NiO/CoN nanointerface, and strongly coupled nanointerface between NiO and CoN domains are responsible for the good bifunctional electrocatalytic performance of NiO/CoN PINWs. The primary Zn-air batteries, using NiO/CoN PINWs as an air-cathode, display an open-circuit potential of 1.46 V, a high power density of 79.6 mW cm(-2), and an energy density of 945 Wh kg(-1).

J	Salimi, Payam; Najafpour, Mohammad Mahdi					Salimi, Payam/0000-0002-2583-7646			A Simple Method for Synthesizing Highly Active Amorphous Iridium Oxide for Oxygen Evolution under Acidic Conditions								CHEMISTRY-A EUROPEAN JOURNAL				26	71			17063	17068		10.1002/chem.202000955		NOV 2020		DEC 18 2020	2020	Water splitting for hydrogen production has been recognized as a promising approach to store sustainable energy. The performance of this method is limited by the oxygen-evolution reaction. Herein, an approach for synthesizing a highly active oxygen-evolving catalyst by a one-step, low-cost, environmentally friendly, and easy-to-perform method is presented, which works by using iridium metal as the anode at a relatively high potential. The obtained IrOx/Ir interface showed an overpotential of 250 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) in 0.1 m HClO4 and remained stable under electrochemical conditions. The IrOx that was mechanically separated from the surface of IrOx/Ir metal after operation showed a threefold increase in activity compared to the current benchmark IrO2 catalyst. Various characterization analyses were used to identify the structure and morphology of the catalyst, which suggested nanosized, porous, and amorphous IrOx on the surface of metallic Ir. This synthetic approach can inspire a variety of opportunities to design and synthesize efficient metal oxide-based electrocatalysts for sustainable energy conversion and utilization.									3	0	0	0	1	0	3			0947-6539	1521-3765		WOS:000594048300001	32852097

Though other chalcogenides such as sulphides and tellurides have also been shown to possess appreciable electrocatalytic water splitting activity as both cathode and anode material, the electrocatalytic activity of nickel selenides in oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) is unmatched by the former one. In the case of HER, nickel selenides are good electrocatalysts in both acid and alkali with some metal dissolution in acid and surface modification to nickel hydroxide in alkali. In the case of OER, nickel selenides have been shown to behave in a unique way in which it acted better than simple nickel hydroxides/oxyhydroxides. This is quite intriguing to researchers and many studies have been recently carried out. However, there is still no exclusive review summarizing the recent development of this material for OER electrocatalysis with highlights on challenges and opportunities. Hence, we have dedicated to discuss the same in this review. In addition, the significance of OER electrocatalysis has been briefly introduced. Finally, all the studies that reported the OER activity of nickel selenides are benchmarked based on the Tafel slope values. With the collective information provided in this review, readers would be updated with the recent trend in utilizing nickel selenides as OER electrocatalysts.

Herein, we suc-cessfully construct an unique CoP3/Fe2P nanosheet catalyst grown on Ni foam (CoP3/Fe2P@NF NSs) via a successive solvothermal-phosphating strategy for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER). It should be emphasized that abundant heterointerfaces and lots of nanopores are formed by in-situ phosphating CoFe layered double hydroxides (CoFe-LDHs) precursor. Specifically, the redis-tribution of electrons at heterogeneous interfaces provides more active sites for reactant molecules or in-termediates, and abundant nanopores on the nanosheets facilitate escape of resulting gas, thus releasing active sites in time. Density functional theory (DFT) calculation also proves that CoP3-Fe2P heterointerfaces can further optimize hydrogen adsorption energy (Delta GH*) to effectively reduce free energy barrier. Thus, the CoP3/Fe2P@NF-2 catalyst presents extraordinary electrocatalytic performance towards HER and OER with overpotentials of 81 mV and 236 mV at 10 mA cm-2. As an encouraging result, it provides a low voltage of 1.53 V at 20 mA cm-2 and satisfactory cycling stabilization of over 28 h, comparable to most reported catalysts. This work affords a promising approach for synthesis of binary and above transition metal phosphides.(c) 2022 Elsevier B.V.

Current efforts mainly focus on surface modification to suppress this unwanted structural transformation. However, the true challenge probably originates from the continuous oxygen release upon charging. Here, the usage of dielectric polarization in surface coating to suppress the oxygen evolution of Li-rich material is reported, using Mg2TiO4 as a proof-of-concept material. The creation of a reverse electric field in surface layers effectively restrains the outward migration of bulk oxygen anions. Meanwhile, high oxygen-affinity elements of Mg and Ti well stabilize the surface oxygen of Li-rich material via enhancing the energy barrier for oxygen release reaction, verified by density functional theory simulation. Benefited from these, the modified Li-rich electrode exhibits an impressive cyclability with a high capacity retention of approximate to 81% even after 700 cycles at 2 C (approximate to 0.5 A g(-1)), far superior to approximate to 44% of the unmodified counterpart. In addition, Mg2TiO4 coating greatly mitigates the voltage decay of Li-rich material with the degradation rate reduced by approximate to 65%. This work proposes new insights into manipulating surface chemistry of electrode materials to control oxygen activity for high-energy-density rechargeable batteries.									88	9	0	0	1	0	88			0935-9648	1521-4095		WOS:000522758800001	32239556

Herein, we report a unique strategy for in-situ grafting three-dimensional (3D) MnFe-PBA cubes on the top of two-dimensional (2D) MnO2 nanosheet arrays (PBA@MnO2) via a facile two-step hydrothermal method with the participation of Ni foam (NF). After experiencing low-temperature pyrolysis in NH3/Ar atmosphere, the above catalysts are transformed into metal-nitride derivatives (N-FeMnNi). Remarkably, when operated in 1.0 M KOH aqueous solution, the as-obtained PBA@MnO2-150/30 (where 150 and 30 represent the hydrothermal temperature (degrees C) and the concentration of K3Fe(CN) 6 (mM) for preparation, respectively) shows the most outstanding OER activity, with an overpotential of 238 mV at 10 mA cm(-2). Moreover, N-FeMnNi-130/10 requires an overpotential of 101 mV to reach 10 mA cm(-2) for HER. As a result, the two samples are organized to establish a two-electrode cell, with a voltage of only 1.60 V needed to reach 10 mA cm(-2). Meanwhile, it can stably work for 30 h without obvious current attenuation. This work provides a brand new perspective for the design of PBA electrocatalysts towards high-efficiency overall water splitting.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000674654300020

Over past years, observable progress has been made by constructing core-shell structures free from or with few noble-metals. They afford particular merits,e.g., a highly-exposed active surface, modulated electronic configurations, strain effects, interfacial synergy, or reinforced stability, to promote the kinetics and electrocatalytic performance of the HER, OER and overall water splitting. So far, a large variety of inorganics (carbon and transition-metal related components) have been introduced into core-shell electrocatalysts. Herein, representative efforts and progress are summarized with a clear classification of core and shell components, to access comprehensive insights into electrochemical processes that proceed on surfaces or interfaces. Finally, a perspective on the future development of core-shell electrocatalysts is offered. The overall aim is to shed some light on the exploration of emerging materials for energy conversion and storage.									37	2	0	0	5	0	37			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000558928800001	32761000

There remains a big challenge to fabricate low-cost and durable electrocatalysts with optimal catalytic performance for ORR, OER and HER. 3D hollow porous carbon based materials with attractive structural properties are usually constructed as promising candidates for electrocatalysis. Herein, we report a reactable ionic liquid (IL) in situ-induced synthesis of Fe3O4 nanoparticles decorated willow catkins derived N-doped 3D hollow porous carbon microtubes multifunctional electrocatalyst (Fe3O4/NCMTs-800(IL)). IL shows a huge advantage of control in synthesizing small size Fe3O4 nanoparticles, achieving uniform nanoparticles on hollow carbon microtubes owing to the interaction between the IL and carbon substrate. The Fe3O4/NCMTs-800(IL) electrocatalyst affords a positive half-wave potential for ORR, small overpotential for the OER and HER, and high stability for water splitting activity. The as-obtained electrocatalyst exhibits efficient and robust electrocatalytic performance can be ascribed to the special 3D porous structure and the synergistic effect of Fe3O4 and doped-N species. The approach indicates the great electrochemical energy applications for biomass and ionic liquids. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

To further improve its performance as EAOP electrode, a Ga2O3-doped PbO2 electrode (Ga2O3-PbO2 electrode) was fabricated by the composite plating method. SEM and XRD results showed that the crystalline in the coating of Ga2O3-PbO2 electrode is more uniform and in smaller size than that in the undoped PbO2 electrode, which provided a higher specific surface area. The electrochemical studies showed that the Ga2O3-PbO2 electrode had higher oxygen evolution potential (OEP) and smaller electrode surface impedance, which is a benefit for the formation of hydroxyl radicals (OH). The electrochemically degradation test using bromocresol green sodium (BG) solution and glucose solution as the simulated wastewater showed that the kinetics of electrochemical catalytic degradation is a pseudo-first-order reaction, and the reaction rate constant on Ga2O3-PbO2 electrode was 2 times accelerated.									16	0	0	0	4	0	16			1432-8488	1433-0768		WOS:000449819800014

Herein, we successfully incorporated Mo into NiCo LDH on the surface of nickel foam (NF) using a hydrothermal approach (NiCoMo LDH/NF), and then used an electrodeposition method to deposit FeOOH uniformly on the surface of ternary NiCoMo LDH/NF to configure an FeOOH-NiCoMo LDH/NF electrocatalyst. The synthesized nanoarray exhibits excellent electrocatalytic performance for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) both in alkaline medium (1.0 M KOH) and simulated alkaline seawater (1.0 M KOH and 0.5 M NaCl aqueous solution), the overpotential is 256 mV and 272 mV at the current density of 50 mA cm(-2), respectively. In addition, the long-term stability is evaluated for 50 h at 50 mA cm(-2) and only a 0.07% increase is observed. The enhanced OER activity is attributed to: (I) the defect - rich structure of holey nanobrush arrays, which increases the number of electrocatalytic active sites; (II) the incorporation of high-valence Mo into the LDH structure, which can tune the electronic structure to reduce the reaction resistance; (III) the improved kinetics from synergistic coupling of FeOOH with ternary NiCoMo LDH.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1144-0546	1369-9261		WOS:000781269300001

In this study, a catalyst was prepared with Pt3Fe nanoparticles anchored on the B,N-codoped carbon (Pt3Fe/BNC) having significant HER activity in pH-universal electrolytes and significant ORR activity in acidic media. The as-prepared Pt3Fe/BNC catalyst exhibits notable HER catalytic activity with small overpotentials (eta) at j = 10 mA cm(-2) (eta = 24 mV in 1.0 M KOH, 72 mV in 1.0 M phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), 38 mV in 0.5 M H2SO4, respectively) and significant ORR performance with a half-wave potential (E-1/2) of 0.835 V in acidic media. Metal-B bonds are demonstrated to form at the interface between Pt3Fe alloys and the B,N-codoped carbon layer, in addition to abundant immobilized Pt3Fe alloys that boost the activity of Pt3Fe/BNC.

In this work, hierarchical CoOOH@Co-FeOOH double-shelled arrays (DSAs) are designed and fabricated through an etching/coprecipitation reaction followed by a simple electrooxidation reaction. The reaction between ZIF-67 and FeSO4 solution is of crucial importance in developing double-shelled structure and highly active material. The formed FeCo layer-double-hydroxide (LDH) not only functions as microreactor and protective layer to effectively prevent CoOOH from collapse, but also acts as precursor to deliver active Co-FeOOH. As expected, the asprepared hierarchical CoOOH@Co-FeOOH DSAs exhibit superior OER activity with a low overpotential of 224 mV and a small Tafel slope of 32 mV dec(-1), far more outperforming RuO2 benchmark. The outstanding performance can be attributed to the remarkable electron transfer rate, robust structure, and abundant accessible active sites.									8	0	0	0	0	0	8			0022-4596	1095-726X		WOS:000607851200046

In this work, a versatile electrocatalyst was developed by growing P-doped CoCO3 nanosheets on Co foam (P-CoCO3/CF). Benefiting from the well-designed nanostructure, good electrical conductivity and high intrinsic activity, the P-CoCO3/CF exhibits excellent multifunctional electrocatalytic performance towards the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), and the hydrazine oxidation reaction (HzOR), respectively. According to the results, only low cell voltages (at j = 10/100 mA cm(-2)) of 1.55/1.77 V are required for the P-CoCO3/CF(+)||P-CoCO3/CF(-) two-electrode couples in 1 M KOH, which are both better than those of RuO2(+)||Pt/C(-) couples. Surprisingly, for using the HzOR as a substitute for the OER, only a voltage (at j = 100 mA cm(-2)) of 0.13 V is needed, which is the smallest potential for hydrogen production reported so far. Theoretical calculations demonstrate that P doping tunes the electronic properties of catalytic center-Co, leading to the desired decrease of the free energy of the rate-determining-step (rds) and efficiency amelioration of HER and HzOR processes.									7	0	0	0	0	0	7			2398-4902			WOS:000632509300001

Here, a N-doped few-layer porous carbon nanosheets catalyst (labeled as NPCSS) with high specific surface area, enormous active sites and high atom ratio of pyridinic/pyrrolic N was obtained by pyrolysis of mixture of corn stalks soot and melamine. Compared with corn stalks soot during pyrolysis without melamine, the NPCSS is featured with more electrochemically active sites and smaller mass transfer resistance, leading to a superior water splitting activity in 1 M KOH solution. NPCSS shows outstanding water splitting performance with small overpotentials of 195 mV and 358 mV for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) at the current density (j) of 10mA cm(-2), respectively.

Herein, we developed a facile fabrication route to prepare N-doped graphene oxide encapsulating nanoparticles of a ternary NiFe metal oxide (NiFeMo@N-rGO) serving as an efficient bifunctional catalyst. The obtained NiFeMo@N-rGO bifunctional catalyst demonstrates a comparable catalytic reactivity when compared to precious metal catalysts in alkaline electrolytes regarding ORR/OER performance (ORR: half-wave potential of 0.82 V; OER: overpotential of 330 mV; E: 0.73 V at 10 mA cm(-2)). The assembled zinc-air batteries (ZABs) catalyzed by NiFeMo@N-rGO exhibit a high power density of 120 mW cm(-2) and a capacity of 721 mAh g(Zn)(-1), coupled with long-term durability of over 200 h. This contribution paves a practical avenue to prepare efficient bifunctional catalysts for superior ZABs.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			2196-0216			WOS:000603140000001

Recently, many non-noble metal-iridium mixed oxides are prepared for catalyzing OER efficiently. Herein, we report a cubic fluorite-type praseodymium iridium oxide with the surface of IrOx (IrOx/Pr3IrO7) that shows the improved activity and stability in 0.1 mol L-1 HClO4 solution, characterized by an overpotential of 305 mV at the benchmark of 10 mA cm(-2) and a small Tafel slope of 37 mV dec(-1), indicating a fast reaction kinetics and a competitive activity compared with the benchmark IrO2 and most reported electrocatalysts. The initial potential increases by less than 0.07 V after continuous OER testing over 60,000 s. In contrast, IrO2 becomes nearly inactive for the OER within 20,000 s. Density functional theory calculations uncover that the optimal energy level path follows lattice oxygen mechanism (LOM). This work enlarges the family of the IrOx-type OER electrocatalyst in acid media.									8	0	0	0	0	0	8			2095-8226	2199-4501		WOS:000631492200003

In this work, we reported a facile morphology regulation strategy for the synthesis of a spherical superstructure of MOF nanosheets. The use of metal hydroxide nanosheets on Zn particles as precursors/templates allowed MOFs with general polyhedron shape to form nanosheets and assemble into a spherical superstructure in the ligand solution. Further, a hollow spherical superstructure of carbon nanosheets decorated with metal-based nanoparticles was fabricated through the pyrolysis of MOF nanosheet superstructures at 950 degrees C, where the substrate/template Zn particle cores were evaporated away. The obtained composites possess carbon-based superstructures with abundant mesopores and metal-based nanoparticles with rich alloy/oxide interfaces. These features endow this MOF-derived carbon-based material with outstanding bifunctional activity for oxygen reduction/evolution reactions and great performances in Zn-air batteries.									23	1	0	0	0	0	23			1530-6984	1530-6992		WOS:000645560000039	33848169

In this study, Pt-Ni alloy nanoparticles supported on carbon black are selected as a model catalyst to understand the relationship between the annealing conditions (temperature and atmosphere) and the electrocatalytic performance for oxygen reduction, hydrogen evolution, and ethanol oxidation reactions. The impacts of thermal treatment temperature and atmosphere on structures, compositions, and in turn electrocatalytic activities are systematically studied. Interestingly, an ultrathin carbon layer can be formed on the nanoparticle surface by heat treatment in Ar atmosphere at temperatures higher than 350 degrees C, which significantly decreases its activity toward oxygen reduction and ethanol oxidation reactions. This carbon coating, however, is absent in other atmospheres including N-2, air, 7% H-2/Ar, and vacuum. Aberration-corrected scanning transmission electron microscopic characterizations with atomic-level resolutions confirm the formation of a Ni-enriched surface on Pt-Ni/C after treatment in Ar, which plays a critical role in catalyzing the growth of stable carbon layers from the surrounding carbons. Further density functional theory calculation results suggest that the absence of a carbon layer in N-2 may originate from the stable N-C bond formed during heat treatment and passivation effect of adsorbed N-2. It illustrates different effects of inert gases on carbon layer formation by combining experimental and computational approaches. These results may shed light on the proper design of postheat treatment protocols for carbon-supported catalysts and may also provide a feasible method to coat carbon layers on nanoparticle surfaces for various energy storage and conversion applications.									18	3	0	0	1	0	19			2155-5435			WOS:000502169900052

However, the know-how required to fabricate distinct interfaces and electronic structures for metal oxides is still a challenge, and the synergistic effect between metal and metal oxides that enhances electrocatalytic activity is still ambiguous. As described here, by controlling the lithium-induced conversion reaction of metal oxides, metal/metal-oxide composites with plentiful interfaces and prominent electrical interconnections were fabricated, which can boost active sites and accelerate mass transfer during electrocatalytic reactions. As a consequence, the superior catalytic activity of ECT-NiMo/NiMoO(4)exhibited a low overpotential of 61 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2)for the hydrogen evolution reaction and 331 mV at 100 mA cm(-2)for the oxygen evolution reaction. When integrated into a two-electrode system, the ECT-NiMo/NiMoO(4)revealed a highly stable and efficient performance in overall water splitting. This work provides a promising approach to enhance the metallicity and electron redistribution of catalysts for numerous water-splitting applications and many other possibilities for energy storage devices.									10	0	0	0	0	0	10			0957-4484	1361-6528		WOS:000575390500001	32975226

Herein, N-, O- and P-doped hollow carbons (NOPHCs) are successfully synthesized via pyrolysis of Co2P-containing polypyrrole (Co2P@PPY) precursors and removal of Co2P templates. The materials are proven to serve as efficient and stable metal-free bifunctional electrocatalysts toward hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in basic media. Notably, NOPHC10-900, which is obtained using 0.10 g of Co2P as template and pyrolyzed at 900 degrees C, exhibits high electrocatalytic performance for HER with a small overpotential of 290 mV at(-10) mA cm(-2), a low Tafel slope of 102 mV dec(-1), and a great long-term stability for 19 h. Moreover, it affords decent electrocatalytic performance for ORR, with positive onset potential, high electron-transfer number, good methanol crossover tolerance and outstanding durability. The excellent electrocatalytic performance is mainly due to the synergistic effect of the multi-heteroatoms dopants in it and the large density of active sites on the surface of the hollow carbons.									101	4	0	0	4	0	102			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000463126200024

The D1 and D2 chloroplast encoded reaction center polypeptides bind cofactors essential for Photosystem II function. Transformation of the chloroplast genome of the eukaryotic green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii has allowed us to engineer site-directed mutants in which aspartate residue 170 of D1 is replaced by histidine (D170H), asparagine (D170N), threonine (D170T), or proline (D170P). Mutants D170T and D170P are completely deficient in oxygen evolution, but retain normal (D170T) or 50% (D170P) levels of Photosystem II reaction centers. D170H and D170N accumulate wild-type levels of PSII centers, yet evolve oxygen at rates approximately 45% and 15% those of control cells, respectively. Kinetic analysis of chlorophyll fluorescence in the mutants reveals a specific defect in electron donation to the reaction center. Measurements of oxygen flash yields in D170H show, however, that those reaction centers capable of evolving oxygen function normally. We conclude that aspartate residue 170 of the D1 polypeptide plays a critical role in the initial binding of manganese as the functional chloroplast oxygen-evolving complex is assembled.									38	0	0	0	32	0	38			0021-9258			WOS:A1995QA28700038	7814379

The preparation of high-efficiency OER electrocatalysts is key to improving the OER efficiency and the only way forward. In this work, a NiFeCo ternary OER high-efficiency electrocatalyst, NiFeCoP@CAP/NF, comprising coexisting crystalline and amorphous phases (CAP), was prepared on nickel foam (NF) by a simple one-step hydrothermal reaction and high-temperature gas-phase phosphating. The as-synthesized catalyst exhibits an ultralow overpotential of 202 mV (10 mA cm-2) in 1 M KOH solution with a Tafel slope (eta 10 = 202 mV) of 28.9 mV dec- 1. Further, it is understood that owing to the combination of the crystalline and amorphous phases, the catalyst can rapidly transform the amorphous phase into the true active (NiOOH) phase of the OER process while retaining the fast charge transport properties of the crystalline phase, as observed by in situ Raman analysis.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0013-4686	1873-3859		WOS:000829304500006

The NiCoFe-S/Ti shows an efficient and stable electrocatalytic performance for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). As an OER catalyst, NiCoFe-S/Ti shows a low overpotential of 230 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) and a small Tafel slope of similar to 65 mV dec(-1). As a HER electrocatalyst, it also shows a low potential of 150 mV at 10 mA cm(-2), a small Tafel slope of 38 mV dec(-1), and a superior durability of maintaining the same catalytical activity for at least 10 h under basic condition. The superior activity and high stability of NiCoFe-S/Ti can be attributed to the highly exposed active sites, excellent charge transfer ability, and good synergistic effect resulted from multi-components. The NiCoFe-S/Ti based overall water splitting exhibits a low onset potential (similar to 1.47 V), a low splitting potential (similar to 1.51 V) at 10 mA cm(-2) in 1.0 M KOH.

While most studies focus on a particular oxide in isolation, a consistent experimental examination of the oxides of adjacent elements is likely to be fruitful with respect to mechanistic elucidation. In the present comprehensive work, the kinetics of the OER proceeding on the anodic passive oxides of iron, cobalt and nickel are probed using steady state polarisation to ascertain values of the Tafel slope, b, and the OH(-) ion reaction order, m(OH-) The critically important matter of the interplay between the observed OER kinetic parameters and the electrochemistry and structure of the underlying oxide, is explored using cyclic voltammetry. Tafel slopes of b approximate to 46 mV dec(-1) observed for pre-reduced Fe and Co anodes, are rationalised on the basis of a "barrier oxide" associated with the inner anhydrous region of the passive film. A reaction path involving the rate determining formation of a superoxy (-OOH) intermediate is proposed. A meaningful comparison of the catalytic performances of the oxides is facilitated by the estimation of active surface areas, using a transient decay measurement technique. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

It was indicated that the most thermodynamically stable location of the Au-Ag bimetal-support interface is the bridging row oxygen vacancy site. On the active region of the Au-Ag catalyst, the Au site is the most active for OER catalyzing the reaction with an overpotential of 0.60 V. Whereas the photocatalytic activity of other active sites follows the trend of Au > Ag > Ti. This finding evident from the projected density of states revealed the formation of the trap state that reduces the band gap of the catalyst promoting activity. In addition, the Bader charge analysis revealed the electron relocation from Ag to Au to be the reason behind the activity of the bimetallic that exceeds its monometallic counterparts.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			2045-2322			WOS:000757107700003	35173262

To this end, the wise assimilation of transition metal compounds with carbon materials is a promising approach to prepare efficient electrocatalysts. Here, we report a facile and cost-effective solvothermal route to synthesize cobalt-pyrazolate framework (Co(pz)) followed by thermal treatment in the air to yield N-doped porous carbon encapsulating uniform cobalt oxides nanoparticles (Co3O4/N-C). The resulting composite material is evaluated as electrocatalyst for the OER in basic media with a low onset potential of similar to 1.52 V (vs. RHE), very small Tafel slope of 44 mV dec(-1), and overpotential of only 390 mV to achieve a stable current density of 10 mA cm(-2) in 1.0 M KOH. The achieved superior oxygen evolution activity in comparison with the state-of-the-art noble metal catalysts originates from in situ incorporation of metal oxides into highly porous carbon matrix, resulting in strong synergistic effects between Co3O4 and N-doped carbon with ordered mesoporous structure leading to the enhanced charge transport and conductivity, and high structural stability. The excellent electrocatalytic performance and superior stability make the Co3O4/N-C a promising non-precious electrode material for the OER.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			1868-2529	1868-5994		WOS:000493633000001

To rationally design COF-based electrocatalysts for oxygen reduction and evolution reactions in fuel cells and metal-air batteries, activity descriptors, derived from orbital energy and bonding structures, are identified with the first-principle calculations for the COFs, which correlate COF structures with their catalytic activities. The calculations also predict that alkaline-earth metal-porphyrin COFs could catalyze the direct production of H2O2, a green oxidizer and an energy carrier. These predictions are supported by experimental data, and the design principles derived from the descriptors provide an approach for rational design of new electrocatalysts for both clean energy conversion and green oxidizer production.									125	7	0	0	7	0	127			0935-9648	1521-4095		WOS:000400344800024	28230916

Crystal structure, morphology and stoichiometry of the catalysts were evaluated by X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX). The face-centred cubic (fcc) crystalline structure of NiO was revealed as being dominant, having an average crystallite size of 9.6 nm. SEM revealed a non-uniform, cotton-like surface for NiO showing aggregation of particles. Crystallinity of the different synthesised compounds decreased as the Ag content increased. The maximum OER activity was observed for pristine NiO, without any Ag additive, requiring an overpotential of only 263 mV to obtain a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at 25 degrees C. The addition of Ag inhibited the OER electrocatalytic activity, which might be due to Ag oxidation being observed at 1.431 V.									21	0	0	0	3	0	21			1868-2529	1868-5994		WOS:000429123900001

Herein, the nanocoral-like hematite film is designed using a simple hydrothermal method. The conductivity of the material improves by Ti ion doping, and a thin ZnFe2O4 film is deposited on the surface to form the type-II heterostructure, which regulates the transport path of the carriers. At the same time, the FeOOH catalyst accelerates the oxygen evolution kinetics on the electrode surface. Finally, the photocurrent density of the Ti-Fe2O3/ZnFe2O4/FeOOH photoanode reaches 1.93 mA cm(-2) at 1.23 V-RHE, and the open voltage is negatively shifted by 200 mV, compared with the Fe2O3 photoanode, down to 0.62 V. This work proves that element doping and surface modification improve the PEC performance by optimizing the transport path of carriers and increasing the reaction rate of oxygen evolution reaction.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			2194-4288	2194-4296		WOS:000664345700001		
J	Ma, Zhong; Zhang, Shuai; Xiao, Rui								Insights into the relationship between microstructural evolution and deactivation of Al2O3 supported Fe2O3 oxygen carrier in chemical looping combustion								ENERGY CONVERSION AND MANAGEMENT				188				429	437		10.1016/j.enconman.2019.03.073				MAY 15 2019	2019	The Fe2O3-Al2O3 oxygen carrier is regarded to a promising candidate for chemical looping combustion (CLC). However, Fe2O3-Al2O3 oxygen carrier was often subjected to a decrease of oxygen carrying capacity. The deactivation mechanism of Fe2O3-Al2O3 oxygen carrier in chemical looping combustion was investigated over consecutive 20 cycles. The Fe2O3-Al2O3 oxygen carrier exhibited relatively poor redox stability in a fixed bed reactor. The physico-chemical properties of cycled Fe2O3-Al2O3 oxygen carrier were characterized by different characterization methods. No carbon deposit was detected in the reduction process, indicating that carbon deposition was not the cause for Fe2O3-Al2O3 oxygen carrier deactivation under this experimental condition. The characterization results showed that the deactivation of Fe2O3-Al2O3 oxygen carrier in redox cycles was mainly attributed to thermal sintering. The cycled Fe2O3-Al2O3 oxygen carrier showed lower surface area, lower reducibility and oxygen mobility than that of fresh sample. After a certain number of redox cycles, Fe diffusion and enrichment at the surface of cycled oxygen carrier was observed. The surface Fe is unstable under high reaction temperature, leading to accelerate thermal sintering. A deactivation mechanism of Fe2O3-Al2O3 oxygen carrier in CLC was proposed based on the Fe diffusion and surface sintering.									40	2	0	0	4	0	41			0196-8904	1879-2227		WOS:000470051000033

Different analytical techniques confirm that the 3D graphene exhibit rose petal-like structure, which is decorated with Co(OH)(2) hexagonal micro coin structure. The hexagonal micro-coin Co(OH)(2) are the actual active sites for electrochemical reactions, while conductive graphene eases the transport of electrons which may further heighten their performance. The as-synthesized electrocatalysts are used to study different electrochemical measurement in an alkaline (1 M KOH) solution. The as-prepared Co(OH)(2)-3 dimensional graphene-0.5 delivered the overpotential value of -0.367 and 1.599 V (vs RHE) (10 mA cm(-2)), the calculated Tafel slope values were 96 and 110 mV dec(-1) for hydrogen and oxygen evolution reactions correspondingly. Different concentrations of Co were used to study the effect of Co on electrochemical measurements. The data shows that Co(OH)(2)-3DG-0.5 exhibited better performance than the other as-prepared Co(OH)(2) based electrocatalysts. The as-prepared electrocatalyst also shows low R-ct and reasonable stability for hydrogen and oxygen evolution reaction. (C) 2019 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Maximum power densities of NCBCO with zirconia-based cells are high, reaching 2.6 W.cm(-2) at 800 ? in solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) mode. Under a solid oxide electrolysis cell (SOEC) mode, the zirconia-based cell with NCBCO achieves an outstanding current density of -4.36 A.cm(-2) at 800 ? with an applied voltage of 1.6 V, surpassing many results of the reported oxygen evolution reaction catalysts with the high activities. Furthermore, RSOCs with NCBCO presents no degradation over entire 400 h in SOFC and SOEC modes. Such outstanding electrocatalytic performances of NCBCO for oxygen electrode reactions might be attributed to its high oxygen vacancy content with a high electrical conductivity. This is confirmed by X-ray absorption spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, temperature-programmed desorption of oxygen, and electron paramagnetic resonance measurements. These results validate that the layered structure NCBCO can be a potential oxygen electrode material for RSOCs.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000856543800004

Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) are promising oxygen electrocatalysts due to their flexible structures, ultrahigh surface area, porosity, and high catalytic activity. However, it is still a significant challenge to achieve bifunctional oxygen electrocatalysts based on MOF materials with comparable activity and durability. Herein, the electronic and catalytic properties of M-3(triphenylene-2,3,6,7,10,11-hexathiol)(2) [M-3(THT)(2)] nanosheets with nine different central metal atoms (Fe, Co, Ni, Ru, Rh, Pd, Os, Ir and Pt) are investigated systematically based on density functional theory. It is found that the electronic and catalytic properties of M-3(THT)(2) nanosheets are mainly based on the central metal atoms. Of the nine different M-3(THT)(2) nanosheets considered, Co-3(THT)(2) displays the best ORR catalytic activity, while Fe-3(THT)(2) shows the best OER catalytic activity. Due to the separation by THT molecules, the electronic and catalytic properties of MS4 groups in bi-metallic M-3(THT)(2) nanosheets are consistent with their single-metal counterparts. Bi-metallic FexCo3-x(THT)(2) nanosheets exhibit bifunctional catalytic activity for both the ORR and OER. The ORR occurs on the Co atom, while the active site for the OER is the Fe atom. With desirable architecture and excellent electrocatalytic activities, the FexCo3-x(THT)(2) nanosheets can be considered as promising bifunctional oxygen electrocatalysts.									15	1	0	0	0	0	15			2044-4753	2044-4761		WOS:000438934700023

The charge/discharge cycle helps to alter the electronic structure via stabilizing more active components on the surface and increases the electronic conductivity by increasing the oxygen vacancies. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and X-Ray Diffraction assists in identifying the chemical states and the structure of different components. The electrochemical techniques suggest that an increase in Co3+ on the surface with the available oxygen vacancies at 2500 charge/discharge cycled sample promotes intermediates like CoOOH, which help in decreasing the overpotential for the OER. We report specific current density with respect to the electrochemical surface area (ECSA), and our best sample shows a specific activity of similar to 6.2 mu A/cm(ECSA)(2) with Tafel slope 85.12mV/dec. Further, the reaction mechanism and different interfacial resistances are identified with the help of electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. This study suggests that an optimum number of charge/discharge cycles are needed to balance the competing factors of electrocatalysts activation and decomposition of the active material.

To resolve this problem, continuous colossal efforts are required to develop the active, affordable and sustainable electrocatalysts. Shape-tailoring of the catalysts, constructed from non-noble metals is one of the emerging strategies to augment the activity of the material toward electrochemical reactions. In the present work, we demonstrate the template-assisted hydrothermal synthesis of hierarchical CoSnO3 hollow microspheres, constructible from the wafer-thin sheets of CoSnO3. The hierarchical CoSnO3 hollow microspheres possess a high specific surface area of 153.59 m(2)/g, and mesoporous configuration, which are the essential pre-requisites of an electrochemical system. In addition to this, the proposed CoSnO3 hollow microspheres possess adequate electroactive surface area (793.5 cm(2)) and happens to be a suitable candidate for driving the oxygen evolution reaction with a low overpotential of 282 my and Tafel slope of 96.5 mV/dec in alkaline medium. The higher turnover frequency (0.0045 s(-1)), high specific and mass activities (2.195 mA/cm(EASA)(2) and 28.752 mA/mg, respectively) were observed for CoSnO3 hollow spheres. Furthermore, the chronoamperometric measurement reveals a good stability of CoSnO3 hollow microspheres in alkaline condition, satisfying the fundamental demand of an energy system.

However, the direct evidence of bridged-bond between ORR and OER catalyst which is crucial for enhancing the electrocatalytic performance, has never been confirmed in the literature. In this manuscript, we exploited a new class of strongly coupled Fe2NiSe4@Fe-NC hybrid material, in which the Fe2NiSe4 nanocubes strongly coupled to the Fe-NC through the selenium-graphitic-nitrogen bond (Se-GNG). Additional characterizations and DET calculations have confirmed that the Se-GNG bond can act as a bridge to deliver the electrons from Fe and Ni to the graphitic-N (Quaternary-N), which is beneficial to enhance both the ORR/OER activity and durability. Due to this strong electronic interaction, this novel hybrid Fe2NiSe4@Fe-NC electrocatalyst reveals superior performance and durable operation without chemical instability towards both ORR/OER.									32	0	0	0	3	0	32			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000514218900001

Herein, we report the crafting of MoC2-doped NiFe alloy nanoparticles (NPs) encapsulated within a-few-layer-thick N-doped graphene (denoted NG-NiFe@MoC2) via one-step calcination of hybrid precursors containing polymer-encapsulating binary Prussian blue analogues NPs and Mo6+ cations. The resulting NG-NiFe@MoC2 nanohybrids were exploited as electrocatalysts and exhibited excellent performance on either HER or OER separately as a direct consequence of the synergistic effects of unique compositions (i.e., MoC2 dopants and NiFe alloy NPs; both exerted profound influence on HER and OER) and advantageous architecture (i.e., a-few-layer-thick N-doped graphene encapsulating shell). Remarkably, an alkaline electrolyte capitalizing on NG-NiFe@ MoC2 nanohybrids as bifunctional electrocatalysts achieved overall water-splitting (i.e., concurrent HER and OER) current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at a low potential of 1.53 V over a period of 10-h operation, outperforming the precious Pt/C//RuO2 counterpart.									164	9	0	0	6	0	164			2211-2855	2211-3282		WOS:000438076200025

Furthermore, the recycling of compounds, such as lithium cobaltate (LiCoO2) from Li-ion battery cathodes, contributes to the recovery of important elements, such as Co and Li. The applicability of high-temperature (HT) LiCoO2 as a multifunctional material has been tested. In this work, HT LiCoO2 is used as an electrocatalyst for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Cyclic voltammetry and chronoamperometry tests show that the evolution of oxygen starts at 0.35 V accompanied by the formation of Co4+ ions. The activation free energy of the reaction calculated using Tafel plot is 28.0 kJ mol(-1) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy elucidates an equivalent circuit with a transfer charge resistance of 1.55 Omega, Warburg impedance of 150.3 Omega, and constant phase elements of 3.50 and 1.35 m F inside the pores and at the double layer, respectively.									13	2	0	0	3	0	15			0025-5408	1873-4227		WOS:000454378400013

As for HER, a low overpotential of 200 mV is required to obtain the same catalytic current density. The overall water electrolyzer by using Co-Cu3P/CF as both anode and cathode showed a low cell voltage of 1.55 V to deliver 10 mA cm(-2). The excellent electrocatalytic performance of Co-Cu3P/CF could be ascribed to its paintbrush-like hierarchical architecture, offering plentiful of active sites and accelerating electrolyte penetration, the presence of Co dopant also could rationally modify its electronic properties, and thus lead to the synergetic effects.

While a relatively good catalytic activity of Pt-Ir catalysts has been shown, data on dissolution stability is less convincing. In this work, two representative oxygen bifunctional catalysts for application in URFCs are synthesized by depositing Pt nanoparticles on hydrous Ir oxide (Pt/IrOx) and rutile Ir oxide (Pt/IrO2). A set of spectroscopy and microscopy techniques is used to characterize the synthesized materials. Regarding the catalytic activity, it is shown that Pt/IrO2 and Pt/IrOx are superior for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER), respectively. Further, the catalysts' stability toward dissolution is evaluated using a scanning flow cell coupled to an inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer (SFC-ICP-MS) setup. Dissolution data reveal that Pt is relatively stable in either ORR or OER potential ranges. On the other hand, dissolution of Ir in the OER protocol is considerable. In the ORR-OER potential range, dissolution of both elements enhances significantly. Especially critical is high dissolution of Pt, which limits lifetime of the catalysts. These results must be considered in the development of novel bifunctional catalyst to be used in URFC. (C) The Author(s) 2018.

Although the best electrocatalyst is IrO2 for OER in the PEMWEs, the practical application of Ir has been impeded because of its high cost and limited activity. Herein, a galvanic replacement reaction mechanism was developed for the preparation of polycrystalline Ni-Ir nanocages (NCs) by using Ni nanoparticles as templates. The formation of Ni-Ir NCs achieves the enhancement of OER catalytic performance, accompanied by the reduction of Ir loading but significantly increasing the efficiency of Ir atoms. The as-prepared Ni2.53Ir NCs exhibit improved catalytic activity toward OER in acid solution, which requires only an overpotential of 302 mV to deliver a current density of 10 mA/cm(2). At an overpotential of 300 mV, the Ir-based mass activity of Ni2.53Ir catalysts reaches 114.7 mA/mg(Ir), which is 2.1 times higher than that of commercial Ir black. The obtained Ni2.53Ir NCs could be potentially applied for industrial scale PEMWE systems.									38	2	0	0	3	0	39			2168-0485			WOS:000414825900032

Herein, four cobalt porphyrins and corroles are deposited on electrode substrates using a simple and fast electropolymerization method. Our results showed that Co-1-P@CC, formed by electropolymerizing Co tetrakis(p-N -pyrrolylphenyl)porphyrin (Co-1-P) on carbon cloth (CC), is the most active OER catalyst in the examined Co porphyrins and corroles in alkaline aqueous solutions by displaying an onset overpotential of 380 mV.

Aiming at increasing the interfacial proton concentration to improve the ORR/HER activity, we synthesize PdNi alloy nanostructures (PdNi-ANSs)-polyethyleneimine (PEI) inorganic-organic nanocomposites (PdNi-ANSs@PEI) by a PEI assisted cyanogel-reduction strategy. Various physical characterization techniques show that PdNi-ANSs are successfully functionalized by the PEI polymer during the synthesis of PdNi-ANSs@PEI because of the N-Pd interaction. Thanks to the increased interfacial proton concentration caused by the protonation of amine groups at PEI in acidic media, the molecular weight optimized PdNi-ANSs@PEI exhibit enhanced ORR/HER activity compared to PdNi-ANSs without PEI and commercial electrocatalysts, which indicates that the electrocatalytic activity of metal nanostructures can be remarkably improved by reasonable interface design.									23	1	0	0	0	0	24			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000448147200055

Despite tremendous efforts, developing bifunctional catalysts with high activity at low cost still remain a great challenge. Here, we report a nanomaterial consisting of core-shell-shaped Fe-Co3O4 grown on carbon nano tubes (Fe-Co3O4/CNTs) and employed as a bifunctional catalyst for the simultaneous electrocatalysts on oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). The Fe Co3O4/CNTs electrocatalyst outperforms the commercial RuO2 catalyst in activity and stability for OER and approaches the performance of Pt/C for HER. Particularly, it shows superior electrocatalytic activity with lowering overpotentials of 120 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) for HER and of 300 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) for OER in 1 M KOH solution. The superior catalytic activity arises from unique core-shell structure of Fe-Co3O4 and the synergetic chemical coupling effects between Fe-Co3O4 and CNTs. (C) 2018 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC.

Traditional fabrication of Nickel foam limits the element modification choices to several inert transition metals only on polymer foam precursor and subsequent preparation of foam-based catalysts in aqueous solution or organic electrolyte. To expand the modification horizon, molten salt with wide electrochemical window and fast ion diffusion can achieve the reduction of highly active elements. Herein, we reported is a general and facile method to deposit directly of highly reactive element La and prepare hierarchical honeycomb LaNi5 alloy on Ni foam (ho-LaNi5/NF). This self-supporting electrode presents excellent electrical coupling and conductivity between the Ni foam and LaNi5, which provides a 3D self-supported heterostructure with outstanding electrocatalytic activity and excellent durability for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER). It exhibits excellent overpotential (1.86 V) comparable to commercial coupled IrO2//Pt/C (1.85 V) at a high current density of 100 mA cm(-2). This work may pave the way for fabricating novel 3D self-supported honeycomb alloy that can be applied as electrode for usage of clean energy.

Here, oxygen vacancy-rich Co3O4 nanorods (NRs) were prepared by treating Co3O4 NRs with a NaBH4 solution. The oxygen vacancy-rich Co3O4 NRs could promote the OER and generation of radicals, thus increasing the ECL intensity of the superoxide radical (O-2(center dot-))- luminol system in a neutral medium without other co-reactants (e.g., H2O2 and dissolved O-2). Hence, the nanocomposite of oxygen vacancy-rich Co3O4 NRs and luminol was promising for ECL analysis. As proof of concept, a novel O-2(center dot-)- luminol ECL sensor was developed for the detection of carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA). It exhibited high selectivity and sensitivity; the linear detection range was 0.005-500 ng/mL and the detection limit was 0.0029 ng/mL. The ECL sensor was applied for the detection of CEA in real samples to evaluate its application feasibility, and satisfactory results were obtained.									5	0	0	0	1	0	5				2574-0970		WOS:000677582900077

Manganese-based spinel oxides usually do not show impressive OER performance, and their activity is generally lower than the counterparts containing cobalt. The OER activity and the electronic structure of spinel oxides ZnMn2O4, ZnCo2O4, and the cobalt-substituted ZnMn2O4 were investigated. It has been found that compared to ZnCo2O4, the lower activity of ZnMn2O4 arises from the limitation of spin-selective electron transfer and orbital symmetry restrictions between adsorption of the oxygen species onto the conduction band and the electron transfer from the conduction band to the valence band. The substitution of cobalt into ZnCo2O4 alleviates the spin incompatibility and enables the increase in OER activity.									42	4	0	0	5	0	42			0897-4756	1520-5002		WOS:000489678800032

Here, Nb-doped TiO2 rod-like particles were synthesized using NaCl-Na2HPO4 molten salt as a reaction medium and applied as a catalyst support in ORR/OER bifunctional GDEs for use in metal-air batteries. The Nb-doped TiO2 rod-like particles were successfully synthesized when Nb(OH)(5) and TiO2 powder consisting of the anatase and rutile phases were used as the Nb and Ti sources, respectively. Heat treatment with solid NaBH2 at 370 ?& nbsp;was able to reduce the Nb-doped TiO2 rod-like particles while avoiding the thermal agglomeration of particles, which led to an increase in the electrical conductivity and OER activity of the Nb-doped TiO2 rod-like particles. The reduced Nb-doped TiO2 & nbsp;rod-like particles showed high stability against anodic corrosion during the OER and higher OER activity than reduced graphene oxide (rGO), which has been reported as a catalyst support in ORR/OER bifunctional GDEs. The loading of LaNiO3 as an ORR/OER bifunctional catalyst onto the reduced Nb-doped TiO2 rod-like particles achieved higher ORR/OER bifunctional activity than the loading of LaNiO3 on rGO, indicating that the reduced Nb-doped TiO2 rod-like particles are superior to rGO as the catalyst support in ORR/OER bifunctional GDEs.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0272-8842	1873-3956		WOS:000791846200004

Scanning electron microscopy observation and X-ray photoelectron spectra analysis show that the Fe2+ -doped layered double hydroxide is grown in situ on nickel foam (NF). CB (XC-72) and NCP further improve the electrical conductivity. At 10 mA.cm(-2), the overpotentials of the OER and HER are 203 mV and 83 mV, respectively, in 1 M KOH. Only 1.48 V is needed when both electrodes are applied for water splitting, and it has a stability of more than 100 h.

The overall water splitting reaction proceeds as two half reactions, namely the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), each of which require catalysts specifically tailored to maximize efficiency. The benchmark catalysts for the HER are noble metals. However, their expense and rarity makes them economically unfeasible for large-scale H(2)production from water. Consequently, there are considerable efforts to find cheap, abundant materials that can efficiently catalyze the HER. Over the last decade, metal chalcogenides and phosphides have emerged as promising candidates for HER. In this review article, we discuss a selection of the multitude of studies and materials in these two classes of catalyst to give a flavor of the relevant developments and properties of these materials. In addition to the selection of catalyst materials, preparation and structuring are playing a strong role in enhancing HER and overcoming fundamental challenges. The role of modeling in the performance of HER catalysts is also discussed and we end with a short perspective on the key attributes of a good HER catalyst.									12	1	0	0	1	0	12			2515-7655			WOS:000570183500001

In this paper, Mo doped CoNi metal-organic framework (MOF)-layered double hydroxide (LDH) nanosheet supported on Ni foam was con-structed. The obtained MOF@LDH-Mo heterostructure array possessed large tangible surface area, rich active species and open electron transport channels, which was employed as electrocatalyst for benzyla-mine oxidation reaction (BOR) to replace OER for boosting hydrogen evolution. Benefitting from the unique structures, the MOF@LDH-Mo presented unprecedented intrinsic activity toward BOR, a high current density of 325 mA cm(-2) can be reached at 1.7 V (vs RHE) in 1 molmiddotL-1 KOH solution. Meanwhile, the cell voltage decreased sharply, especially compared with that of overall water splitting (e.g. a reduction of 260 mV for the benchmark current density of 100 mA cm(-2)). Apart from H-2 production at cathode, value added chemical, benzonitrile, was yielded at anode with high Faradaic efficiency. This research provides an environmental friendly aqueous electrocatalytic route for production of valuable chemicals as well as green energy, hydrogen. (c) 2022 Elsevier B.V.

Moreover, the structural evolution of the metal phosphides in the oxygen evolution process has been well monitored. X-ray absorption near-edge structure analyses and computational studies reveal that the structural merits and the effective intramolecular electronic coupling between the Fe and Co atoms via P/O bridges are responsible for the greatly improved electrocatalytic activity.									169	9	0	0	14	0	170			1754-5692	1754-5706		WOS:000494816300006

However, the electrocatalytic performance is usually not distinctly improved because the interfacial resistance between metal oxides and carbon is still large and thereby hinders the charge transport in catalysis. Herein, the conductive interface between poorly conductive NiO nanoparticles and semi-conductive carbon nitride (CN) is constructed. The NiO/CN exhibits much-enhanced oxygen evolution reaction (OER) performance than corresponding NiO and CN in electrolytes of KOH solution and phosphate buffer saline, which is also remarkably superior over NiO/C, commercial RuO2, and mostly reported NiO-based catalysts. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and extended X-ray absorption fine structure spectrum reveal that a metallic Ni-N bond is formed between NiO and CN. Density functional theory calculations suggest that NiO and CN linked by a Ni-N bond possess a low Gibbs energy for OER intermediate adsorptions, which not only improves the transfer of charge but also promotes the transmission of mass in OER. The metal-nitrogen bonded conductive and highly active interface pervasively exists between CN and other transition metal oxides including Co3O4, CuO, and Fe2O3, making it promising as an inexpensive catalyst for efficient water splitting.									126	5	0	0	8	0	126			1616-301X	1616-3028		WOS:000481383800001

Herein, a facile strategy was first developed to tune the morphology of coordinated transition bimetal complexes via controlling the growth rates of {111} and {100} facets using sulfur as a morphological modulator and template-engaged pyrolysis to form a unique hollow polyhedron (S-FeNi@NC). By virtue of the structural and compositional features, the optimized S-FeNi@NC hollow cuboctahedron shows excellent activities with a remarkably small overpotential of 272 mV to reach 20 mA cm(-2), a lower Tafel slope with 84 mA dec(-1), and an excellent durability without degradation after 5000 CV cycles toward oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in an alkaline medium.

Therefore, it is essential to explore exceptional electrocatalysts for these energy systems. Nanostructured manganese dioxide (MnO2) and its composites perform well as electrocatalysts in OER owing to their morphologies, pore structures, and crystallographic structures. This review exhaustively summarizes MnO(2)and its composites with respect to their applications in the OER. Moreover, the influence of structures and polymorphs of MnO(2)and its composites on OER properties is thoroughly discussed. We believe that in future, MnO(2)and its composites as electrocatalysts for OER can have a profound and lasting impact.									18	0	0	0	1	0	18			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000572173300003

Design and construction of appropriate defects is an effective strategy to enhance catalytic activity. Mn has stronger e(-)-e(-) repulsion by the local influence of its 3d orbital electrons. When Mn(iii) was successfully introduced into two dimensional F-doped Ni(OH)(2), it can tune the surface electronic structure of the F-doped Ni(OH)(2) to increase its oxygen deficiency content. In this work, the as-synthesized Mn and F co-doped Ni(OH)(2)-NF on Ni foam (Mn-F/Ni(OH)(2)-NF) shows remarkable oxygen evolution performance, exhibiting 233 mV overpotential at 20 mA cm(-2), and the Tafel slope is 56.9 mV dec(-1) in 1 M KOH. The performance is better than that of the same loading of IrO2 on Ni foam. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations further show that the introduction of oxygen defects can significantly improve the OER catalytic performance of Mn-F/Ni(OH)(2)-NF.									16	1	0	0	0	0	16			2516-0230			WOS:000492772600027	36132091

The electrochemical characteristics of ternary-oxide electrodes with a general formula Ru0.2Ti0.8-xSnxO2 for oxygen evolution from 1M H2SO4 solution were examined as a function of x by CV and AC impedance measurements. The stability of ternary-oxide electrodes was examined by accelerated corrosion test in 1M H2SO4 solution. The morphologies of ternary-oxide electrodes before and after accelerated corrosion test were investigated by SEM. Introducing SnO2 into Ru-Ti binary-oxide electrodes would improve the performance of electrodes by increasing q*and C(dl) and decreasing R(ct). For the greater the content of SnO2 in ternary-oxide electrodes, the larger the R(ct) and the better the stability for oxygen evolution would occur.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0368-1653			WOS:A1994NQ10100002

The effect of composition on the electrocatalytic activity of anodes for oxygen evolution reaction in acidic solution was investigated. The electrochemical behaviour of coatings was studied using different electrochemical techniques. Surface properties of the mixed metal oxide in solution and related redox reactions were measured by cyclic voltammetry. The reaction mechanisms and electrocatalytic properties of mixed metal oxide coatings were studied systematically by anodic polarisation measurement in 0.5M H2SO4 solution. It was observed that the electrochemically active surface areas reach a maximum around intermediate composition. The different reaction mechanisms were proposed according to different Tafel slopes obtained from the Tafel lines. It was shown the real electrochemical activity is related to electronic factors and synergetic effects.									2	0	0	0	1	0	2			0020-2967	1745-9192		WOS:000319003600007

However, metal SACs anchored on carbon materials are relatively uncommon for the OER. In this paper, using carbon black as carrier, NiFe SACs are fabricated by one step pyrolysis method. When the weight ratio of Ni/Fe is lower than 5:3, NiFe@C exibits highly-dispersed SACs over carbon in addition to some Ni3Fe alloy. The prepared NiFe@C 5:3 SACs showed excellent OER performance with an overpotential of 322 mV and 438 mV for current density of 10 mA/cm2 and 100 mA/cm2, respectively. The Tafel slope of NiFe@C 5:3 was as small as 87.6 mV/dec, indicating fast charge transfer of NiFe@C 5:3 during OER process, which was also confirmed by electrochemical impedance spectra with Rct 1/4 18.07 Ucm2. Meanwhile, NiFe@C 5:3 had the highest specific capacitance of 5 mF/cm2 with good stability. This work provides a reference for designing electocatalyst material for efficient, stable and economical OER process. (c) 2022 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Herein, we report the successful creation of a class of hollow iridium (Ir)-silver (Ag) nanotubes (NTs) via a facile selective etching approach. Because of the unique properties of hollow structure and enriched oxidized Ir on the surface, the optimized Ir6Ag9 NTs show low oxygen evolution reaction overpotentials of 285 mV and 296 mV at 10 mA/cm(2) in 0.5 M and 0.05 M H2SO4, respectively, being superior to the commercial Ir/C. The Ir6Ag9 NTs also exhibit lower hydrogen evolution reaction overpotentials (only 20 mV and 34 mV at 10 mA/cm(2) in 0.5 M and 0.05 M H2SO4, respectively). More significantly, the Ir6Ag9 NTs/C can be further applied as bifunctional electrocatalysts with very low cell voltage of only 1.55 V at 10 mA/cm(2) in 0.5 M H2SO4 as well as excellent durability with very small activity loss after 1000 cycles, holding much potential in the practical application in proton exchange membrane water electrolyzer.									89	5	0	0	4	0	89			2211-2855	2211-3282		WOS:000455264600034

This research finds that the as-prepared NiFe LDH@ NiCoP/NF electrodes have a more sophisticated inner structure and intensive interface than a simple physical mixture. The NiFe LDH@ NiCoP/NF electrodes require an overpotential as low as 120 and 220 mV to deliver 10 mA cm(-2) for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in 1 M KOH, respectively. Tafel and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy further reveal a favorable kinetic during electrolysis. Specifically, the NiFe LDH@ NiCoP/NF electrodes are simultaneously used as cathode and anode for overall water splitting, which requires a cell voltage of 1.57 V at 10 mA cm(-2). Furthermore, the synergistic effect of the heterostructure improves the structural stability and promotes the generation of active phases during HER and OER, resulting in excellent stability over 100 h of continuous operation. Moreover, the strategy and interface engineering of the introduced heterostructure can also be used to prepare other bifunctional and cost-efficient electrocatalysts for various applications.									505	32	0	0	20	0	508			1616-301X	1616-3028		WOS:000429410400022

In this work, a facile strategy is developed for scalable fabrication of dicobalt phosphide (Co2P)-cobalt nitride (CoN) core-shell nanoparticles with double active sites encapsulated in nitrogen-doped carbon nanotubes (Co2P/CoN-in-NCNTs) by straight forward pyrolysis method. Both density functional theory calculation and experimental results reveal that pyrrole nitrogen coupled with Co2P is the most active one for HER, while Co-N-C active sites existing on the interfaces between CoN and N-doped carbon shells are responsible for the ORR and OER activity in this catalyst. Furthermore, liquid-state and all-solid-state Zn-air batteries are equipped. Co2P/CoN-in-NCNTs show high power density as high as 194.6 mW cm(-2), high gravimetric energy density of 844.5 W h kg(-1), very low charge-discharge polarization, and excellent reversibility of 96 h at 5 mA cm(-2) in liquid system.

Although many photocatalysts were reported to be active for this reaction, the efficiency is still quite low. In this work, we found that hydrogen and oxygen recombination took place rapidly in the Pt/TiO2 dispersion and resulted in very low hydrogen generation rate in pure water. The activation energy of H-2 and O-2 recombination reaction is 16.5 kJ/mol regardless of light irradiation or not. In this case, the photocatalytic evolved H-2 could react rapidly with the evolved O-2 to form H2O again, eventually leading to no net H-2 and O-2 evolution during irradiation. The recombination of hydrogen and oxygen can be inhibited by addition of oxygen transfer reagent hemin chloride (HC). With help of HC, photocatalytic generated oxygen was captured by HC and transferred away from photocatalyst surface, then the backward reaction of hydrogen-oxygen recombination was successfully restrained. The photocatalytic hydrogen evolution amount in Pt/TiO2 dispersion was significantly enhanced under this condition. The isotopes' analysis results confirmed that both the H-2 and O-2 were from water. The HC could be recycled by releasing the O-2 with Ar gas bubbling. The HC could be poisoned by carbon monoxide and lost its oxygen transfer property, therefore no hydrogen could be formed under irradiation. This study clarified the main impediment reason of low efficient photocatalytic hydrogen generation in semiconductor-water dispersion and present available method to avoid this negative reaction. This finding will help to design high active catalytic system for solar energy to hydrogen conversion and open a new window for overall water splitting research. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Here, we report the individual functionality of Co3O4 and the N-doped carbon nanoweb (CNW) in ORR and OER. The Co3O4/CNW bifunctional catalysts were synthesized by an in situ growth of Co precursors onto CNW followed by a controlled heat treatment. The specific functions of Co3O4 and CNW were delineated by rotating disk electrode measurements. It was found that Co3O4 alone exhibited poor ORR catalytic activity. However, in the presence of CNW, Co3O4 assisted the selective four-electron oxygen reduction over the two-electron pathway. Analyses of the Tafel slope and reaction order suggested that Co3O4 acted as the primary catalytic site for OER. CNW improved the electronic conduction between Co3O4 and the current collector. CNW underwent serious degradation at the high potential of the OER but its stability improved greatly upon the deposition of Co3O4. Two possible mechanisms for the improved catalytic stability are discussed. The findings demonstrate the specific functions of Co3O4 and CNW in catalyzing the OER and ORR and further establish an understanding of the synergy of the composite in electrocatalysis.									84	3	0	0	3	0	85			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000354952500052

Electron-deficient palladium and free electron at oxygen vacancies facilitate the adsorption of oxygen species, thereby enhancing the OER performance. Moreover, hybridization of defect-rich N-doped carbon with catalytically active Pd nanoparticles advances the ORR activity. Through a delicate synthetic method, we synthesized the bi-functional catalysts, Pd and CoOx embedded in defect-rich and N-doped carbon materials (Pd/CoOx/d-NC), for rechargeable Zn-air battery. Pd/CoOx/d-NC exhibits superior activities and robust durability for both the ORR and OER. In addition, it shows higher performance than the benchmark Pt/C + IrO2 when applied to the Zn-air battery.

NiCO(2)S(4)pN/S-rGO was synthesized by a one-pot solvothermal strategy using Co(OAc)(2), Ni(OAc)(2), thiourea, and graphene oxide as precursors and ethylene glycol as the dispersing agent; simultaneously, traces of nitrogen and sulfur were double-doped into the reduced graphene oxide (rGO) in the forms of pyrrolic-N, pyridinic-N, and thiophenic-S, which are often desirable for metal-free ORR catalysts. In, comparison with commercial Pt/C catalyst, NiCo(2)S(4)pN/S-rGO shows less reduction activity, much better., durability, and superior methanol tolerance toward ORR in 0.1 M KOH; it reveals,higher activity toward OER in both KOH,electrolyte and phosphate buffer at pH 7.0. NiCo2S4@graphene demonstrated excellent overall. bicalytic performance, and importantly, it suggests a novel kind of promising nonprecious bifunctional catalyst in the related renewable energy devices.									584	16	0	0	21	0	587			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000320484000069	23662625

Here, nitrogen-doped carbon engrafted Mo2N/CoN hybrid nanosheets that are seamlessly oriented on hierarchical nanoporous Cu scaffold (Mo-/Co-N-C/Cu), as highly efficient electrocatalysts for alkaline hydrogen evolution reaction are reported. The constituent heterostructured Mo2N/CoN nanosheets work as bifunctional electroactive sites for both water dissociation and adsorption/desorption of hydrogen intermediates while the nitrogen-doped carbon bridges electron transfers between electroactive sites and interconnective Cu current collectors by making use of Mo-/Co-N-C bonds and intimate C/Cu contacts at interfaces. As a consequence of unique architecture having electroactive sites to be sufficiently accessible, self-supported nanoporous Mo-/Co-N-C/Cu hybrid electrodes exhibit outstanding electrocatalysis in 1 m KOH, with a negligible onset overpotential and a low Tafel slope of 47 mV dec(-1). They only take overpotential of as low as 230 mV to reach current density of 1000 mA cm(-2). When coupled with their electro-oxidized derivatives that mediate efficiently the oxygen evolution reaction, the alkaline water electrolyzer can achieve approximate to 100 mA cm(-2) at 1.622 V in 1 m KOH electrolyte, approximate to 0.343 V lower than the device constructed with commercially available Pt/C and Ir/C nanocatalysts immobilized on nanoporous Cu electrodes.									21	0	0	0	1	0	21			1616-301X	1616-3028		WOS:000645562500001

We investigate the initial stage activities and the electrocatalytic durability of bifunctional catalysts composed of MnO2 and perovskite (LaNiO3 or LaCoO3) in a 1:1 weight ratio. Gas diffusion electrodes (GDE) with a catalyst layer composed of MnO2:co-catalyst (LaNiO3 or LaCoO3):Vulcan XC-72 were prepared and studied in O-2 saturated 6 M KOH. The initial stage bifunctional activities of MnO2-LaCoO3 and MnO2-LaNiO3 are markedly superior compared to either MnO2 or perovskite alone, demonstrating a synergistic effect. Furthermore, we show for the first time that the degradation of the bifunctional electrocatalytic activity of the MnO2-perovskite electrodes during extensive potential cycling can be fully restored by resting the electrodes at open-circuit potential in 6 M KOH. A hypothesis is proposed to explain this catalytic promotion and 'healing' effect based on XPS results showing potassium ion incorporation in the electrocatalyst structure. Lastly, a thorough comparison of the results obtained in the present work with those reported in the literature with a variety of bifunctional catalysts is presented, demonstrating the effectiveness of the MnO2-perovskite electrodes.

The hybrid structures are synthesized via heat treatment of N-doped hollow carbon microspheres with cobalt nitrate, and both the specific ratio of these precursors and the selected annealing temperature are found to be the key factors for the formation of the unique hybrid structure. The as-obtained product (Co-N/Co-O@N-C) presents a large specific surface area (493 m(2) g(-1)), high-level heteroatom doping (Co-N, Co-O, and N-C), and hierarchical porous nanoarchitecture containing macroporous frameworks and mesoporous walls. Electronic interaction between the thin N-C layers and the encapsulated Co-N and Co-O nanofragments efficiently optimizes oxygen adsorption properties on the Co-N/Co-O@N-C and thereby triggers bifunctional oxygen electrochemical activity at the surface. The Co-N/Co-O@N-C nanohybrid exhibited a high onset potential of 0.93 V, and a limiting current density of 5.6 mA cm(-2) indicating 4-electron oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), afforded high catalytic activity for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and even exceeded the catalytic stability of the commercial precious electrocatalysts; furthermore, when integrated into the oxygen electrode of a regenerative fuel cell device, it exhibited high-performance oxygen electrodes for both the ORR and the OER.									25	3	0	0	1	0	26			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000413870900013	28994435

Herein, the cobalt sulfide nanocrystals uniformly dispersed on porous chemical-modified carbon sheets were fabricated through a facile polymerization-carbonization strategy based on dopamine. The well-developed architecture and sufficient electrochemically accessible active centers of the developed catalysts together contribute to the highly bifunctional oxygen electrochemistry in alkaline medium in terms of positive half-wave potential of 0.84 V for ORR and low applied potential of 1.58 V to afford 10 mA cm(-2) current density for OER, with performance comparable to the state-of-the-art noble metal benchmarks. Impressively, the assembled Zn-air batteries using the synthesized bifunctional catalysts as the air electrode reveal superior charge-discharge performance and robust durability, exhibiting great potential in practical implementation of new-generation and powerful metal-air batteries. This universal work would provide an effective strategy for the development of carbon-based materials with controllable nanostructure for energy-related applications.									31	4	0	0	1	0	31			2168-0485			WOS:000470331800044

Despite exhibiting initially high activity for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), a rapid and reversible activity decay is observed during continuous operation. The potential dependence of recovery of the activity is explored, and 0.0 V vs NHE is found to be an effective potential to recover the initial water oxidation performance. Iridium thin films on rotating disk electrodes are used to show that this OER activity decay is neither explained by progressive oxidation of the iridium nor by reduced mass transport to/from the electrode surface. Careful examination of the time dependence of the activity decay reveals that it is well described by a t(-1/4) functional dependence across multiple electrochemical cell geometries. Tafel behavior is analyzed by normal pulse voltammetry, suggesting that, after 10 minutes of activity decay, the catalyst exhibits a five-fold decrease in active site density while the mechanism of water oxidation is not altered. We hypothesize that this decay may result from a loss of active sites capable of forming the Ir(V) = O species, possibly via progressive cross-linking of iridium sites by bridging mu-oxides.

X-ray diffraction (XRD) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) tests reveal that IrO2 is uniformly supported on RGO surface with ultrafine IrO2 nanoparticles (ca. 1.7 nm). Linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) tests indicate that the catalytic activity of IrO2/RGO hybrid towards oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is 2.3 times that of commercial IrO2. The superior OER activity of IrO2/RGO hybrid is attributed to the enhanced surface area and the improved electrical conductivity of IrO2 due to the introduction of graphene support. Lifetime tests demonstrate that IrO2/RGO hybrid has unexpectedly high OER durability. It also displays an excellent performance in long-time water electrolysis. This may be interpreted in terms of the dispersion retention of IrO2 nanoparticles on RGO surface, which is caused by the interaction between IrO2 and Pi-electrons of RGO.

Thus, it is vital to design highly active and durable electrocatalyst for OER.

Compared with the limited amount of fresh water, seawater is an abundant resource that has attracted increasing attention for electrolysis. However, seawater electrolysis has thus far suffered from degraded activity and stability, and from low oxygen evolution reaction (OER) selectivity, due to the existence of chloride ions and insoluble solids in seawater. This short review summarizes trends in the rational design of OER catalysts, providing some effective strategies, including constructing 3D hierarchical porous structures, employing protective layers, and engineering surface wettability, to synthesize efficient and stable OER catalysts for seawater electrolysis.

In this work, we propose a facile approach to fabricate a self-supported Co-Mo-B/CC electrode, via electrodepositing amorphous Co-Mo-B spheres on the carbon cloth (CC) supports. The prepared Co-Mo-B/CC electrode possesses comparable catalytic activity for HER with a low overpotential of 84.5 mV at -10 mA cm(-2) (cathodic current density). Meanwhile, it displays high activity for OER with 92.6 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) (anodic current density). In addition, the two-electrode electrolysis system of Co-MoB/CC(-)//Co-Mo-B/CC(+) exhibits a quite low cell voltage of 1.694 V to drive j(cell) = 10 mA cm(-2) for overall water splitting and outstanding durability, which makes it a promising bifunctional electrocatalyst for both the HER and OER.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			1452-3981			WOS:000629654700001

Metal-organic framework (MOF) catalysts, which are porous solid materials at the frontier between homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysis, have emerged as promising candidates. Earth-abundant MOF-74 materials have recently shown great performance towards the OER, but the true nature of their active sites remains unclear. Here, we employ density functional theory (DFT + U) to elucidate the reaction mechanism and rationalize the electrocatalytic activity of Fe-MOF-74. Our results demonstrate that the open metal sites of the pristine catalyst do not promote the OER; instead, metal sites associated with defective structures do. This study provides new insights into guiding the rational synthesis and post-synthetic engineering of MOFs for electrocatalysis.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			2044-4753	2044-4761		WOS:000624503000019

Herein, we propose a facile micelle-assisted reduction method for the development of uniform RhIr mesoporous nanospheres (RhIr MNs). Benefiting from the 3D mesoporous morphology and favorable electron structure, the RhIr MNs show superior electrocatalytic activity compared to the Rh MNs for both the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and HzOR in alkaline media. When the RhIr MNs are used as a bifunctional catalyst for the two-electrode overall hydrazine splitting, it only requires a low voltage of 0.13 V to afford 10 mA cm(-2), much lower than that of the overall water splitting system. This proposed approach is universal for the rational design of efficient bifunctional Rh-based nanomaterials for hydrazine-assisted water splitting.									7	0	0	0	1	0	7			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000686245900001

In this work, a hybrid material consisting of well-dispersed sub-nanometer-sized (SNS) iridium (Ir) species decorated on mesoporous Co3O4 was fabricated as electrocatalyst for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) through pyrolysis of IrCl3/Co(NO3)(2) complexes confined within the mesoporous KIT-6 template. It was found that the KIT-6 template played a critical role in the formation of SNS Ir species. The optimized Ir-Co3O4-1 showed highly efficient OER catalytic performance with an overpotential of 1.527V to achieve the current density of 10mAcm(-2), and superior stability in alkaline condition. The electrochemical results demonstrated that moderate Ir incorporation was conductive to form the high valence Co ions in form of Co oxyhydroxide during the OER process. The present work would open a new route for material design of SNS Ir species decorated mesoporous metal oxides for the application in catalysis.									9	0	0	0	0	0	9			2196-0216			WOS:000463752300030

The evidence obtained with a combination of in situ surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy, online electrochemical mass spectrometry and density functional theory calculations suggests the existence of several mechanisms for the evolution of O-2 on Au electrodes, depending on the electrode potential. Significantly, at approximately 2.0 V vs. RHE the first O-2 that is evolved consists of two oxygens from the surface oxide, suggesting an oxide decomposition or oxide disproportionation step. At somewhat higher potentials, O-2 is formed by a combination of oxygen from the oxide lattice and oxygen provided by water. The oxide decomposition step implies a more three-dimensional mechanism for oxygen evolution than suggested in previous mechanisms, which involve only surface-adsorbed intermediates.									169	4	0	0	12	0	171			2041-6520	2041-6539		WOS:000318559700004

OER is a four-electron process with sluggish reaction kinetics. RuO2 and IrO2 are the benchmark catalysts for OER. Thus, finding a low-cost, earth-abundant, and stable electrocatalyst for OER is a big challenge. In this work, we report OER over Se-CuO/CF nanoarrays with an ultralow overpotential of 440 mV (at 50 mA/cm2 current density). Se-CuO/CF nanoarray has a TOF of 0.05 s-1 at 300 mV. The catalyst showed consistent OER performance upto1000 cycles run over a period of 10 h. The OER performance of Se-CuO/CF nanoarrays was compared with RuO2/CF catalyst and the overpotential for RuO2/CF nanoarray was only 10 mV lower than Se-CuO/CF 50 mA/cm2 current density. Se-CuO/CF nanoarray showed 50 mV lower overpotential than the state of the art RuO2/CF catalyst at a current density of 100 mA/cm2. The Tafel slope of Se-CuO/CF is 21 mV/decade lower compared to RuO2/CF suggesting faster reaction kinetics of Se-CuO/CF. The electrochemical surface area and the conductivity were increased upon doping Se into CuO/CF nanoarrays which can be attributed to enhanced OER performance of the Se-CuO/CF nanoarrays.

The NFN-MOF/NF achieves ultralow overpotentials of 240 and 87 mV at current density of 10 mA cm(-2) for the oxygen evolution reaction and hydrogen evolution reaction, respectively, in 1 m KOH. For the overall water splitting, it requires only an ultralow cell voltage of 1.56 V to reach the current density of 10 mA cm(-2), outperforming the pairing of Pt/C on NF as the cathode and IrO2 on NF as the anode at the same catalyst loading. The stability of the NFN-MOF/NF catalyst is also outstanding, exhibiting only a minor chronopotentiometric decay of 7.8% at 500 mA cm(-2) after 30 h. The success of the present NFN-MOF/NF catalyst is attributed to the abundant active centers, the bimetallic clusters {Fe2Ni(mu(3)-O)(COO)(6)(H2O)(3)},in the MOF, the positive coupling effect between Ni and Fe metal ions in the MOF, and synergistic effect between the MOF and NF.									204	6	0	0	10	0	203			1614-6832	1614-6840		WOS:000441741900027

The morphology of the CoPO is regular circular nanoflakes with the diameter size of 2-5 mu m. The nickel foam supported cobalt phosphate (CoPO/NF) which presents more prominent oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity and stability shows an overpotential (116 mV at 10 mA cm(-2)) and Tafel slope (65.6 mV dec(-1)) superior to previously reported CoPO and commercial RuO2 catalysts. Furthermore, after 48 h current-time test, the CoPO/NF maintains 96.7% compared to initial current density. The maximum current densities of CoPO/NF in the linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) curves are basically stable from the 1st cyclic voltammetry (CV) cycle to the 20000th CV cycles. The prominent OER performance of CoPO/NF can be put down to the nickel foam substrate, which amplifies the electrochemically active superficial area of CoPO nanoflakes. The low-cost, simple and convenient preparation method, favorable catalytic activity and stability make this CoPO/NF material a hopeful OER electmcatalyst for electrochemical water oxidation.									15	0	0	0	1	0	15			0378-7753	1873-2755		WOS:000530838000029

Herein, we synthesized cobalt nanoleaves metal-organic framed work (MOF) on nickel foam substrate with uniform growth. After calcination of Co-MOF, molybdenum disulfide nanosheets is grown by a facial hydrothermal method. The as-prepared heterostructure (Co3O4/MoS2) can act as bifunctional electrocatalysts for overall water splitting. Under optimized condition, synthesized Co3O4/MoS2 heterostructure catalyst exhibited excellent catalytic activity for both OER and HER in 1 M KOH solution with a current density of 20 mA cm(-2) at overpotential of 230 mV for OER and 205 mV for HER (@ j = 10 mA cm(-2)) and Tafel slopes of 45 and 98 mV dec(-1), respectively. The superior catalytic activity for both OER and HER arises from the unique heterostructure of Co3O4/MoS2 and the synergistic effects of Co3O4 and MoS2.									207	12	0	0	8	0	208			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000463126200020

However, the development of a general strategy for the preparation of metal phosphides has remained challenging. In this work, we demonstrate a two-step, aerosol spray-based strategy for the synthesis of various mesoporous monometallic and multimetallic phosphide microspheres. Four monometallic (FeP, CoP, Ni2P, and Cu3P), one bimetallic (Co6Ni4P5) and one trimetallic (Co4Ni3Cu2P10) phosphide samples are successfully prepared, suggesting the generality of our method. In addition, the CoP sample is found to be an excellent material for the hydrogen evolution reaction over a wide pH range through the introduction of corrosion-resistant Cr2O3. On the other hand, its catalytic activity can be switched to the oxygen evolution reaction in combination with Fe2O3. The overpotential for the oxygen evolution reaction to generate a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) is as low as 302 mV. This activity can be maintained for at least 50 h. More importantly, a two-electrode electrolyzer constructed from 10% Cr-CoP and 30% Fe-CoP samples delivers a current density of 100 mA cm(-2) at a cell voltage of merely 1.67 V, showing the use of these cost-effective materials for bifunctional water splitting.									47	4	0	0	0	0	47			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000428848400026

However, how the active layer forms and works in the OER process has not been understood clearly. Here, we demonstrate a facile approach to reveal the mechanism for the formation of active layer and its role in OER by fabricating the NiCobased hybrid as a precatalyst. We find that the anodization can improve its OER activity, leading to a low OER overpotential of 276 mV at 20 mA cm(-2) and favorable durability (>= 100 h). In -situ Raman spectroscopy and ex situ characterizations reveal that the Ni-CoOOH nanosheets array with promising surface wettability is generated via deep reconstruction during the OER process and the high-valence Co is the active site for efficient oxygen evolution. Theoretical analysis further illustrates that the Co site can be activated by the Ni incorporation, thus optimizing the adsorption capability toward the intermediates.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000799993000001

Downsizing the conventional nanoparticle catalyst to single atoms and constructing single-atom catalysts (SACs) is a rapidly emerging research focus. Because of the involvement of unique single-atom active moieties and the strong metal support interactions arising from interfacial bonding, SACs as promising alternatives to noble metal-based nanoparticle catalysts exhibit profound power in the HER and OER. Here, we present a perspective on the exciting advances of SACs for HER and OER applications, with an emphasis on innovative synthetic strategies and an in-depth understanding of the structure activity relationship through a combination of systematic characterization and theoretical studies.

In this work, a novel four-part electrocatalyst of mesoporous cobalt/iron phosphorus selenide nanocomposite (CoFe-Se-P) was derived from hollow CoFe Prussian blue analogues (CoFe-PBA) and combined by phosphatization and selenylation. This novel electrocatalyst displays an efficient and durable bifunctional catalysis performance for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER). In view of strong electron interaction among Co, Fe, Se, and P, this four-part electrocatalyst exhibits a lower onset potential of -5.9 mV and an overpotential of -72.5 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) in acidic solution for HER In alkaline solution, the onset potential and the overpotential are maintained at approximately -3 and -183.1 mV, respectively. Moreover, the proposed CoFe-Se-P catalyst possesses superior OER performance with a lower onset potential of 1.07 V and overpotential of 1.44 V at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) in 0.1 M KOH solution. The versatile electrocatalyst can catalyze water splitting in a two-electrode system at a potential of 1.59 V.

However, their large-scale applications have been severely limited by precious and unsustainable noble-metal electrocatalysts. Hence, it is highly desirable to develop robust electrocatalysts composed exclusively of low-cost and earth-abundant elements, to reduce or replace expensive and scarce noble-metals. Carbon-based nanomaterials, including heteroatoms-doped carbons and carbon-encapsulated metal materials, have recently attracted great interests because they show remarkable electrocatalytic performance and long-term stability for energy-related reactions, such as oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), hydrogen and oxygen evolution reactions (OER), hydrazine oxidation reaction (HzOR), etc. This review summarizes the recent progress in heteroatoms-doped carbon and carbon-encapsulated metal materials, highlighting the promise as cost-efficient electrocatalysts.

Herein, a Zn-doped Ni3FeN/nitrogen-doped graphene (Zn-Ni3FeN/NG) electrocatalyst was designed and synthesized via a facile and reliable method. Thanks to the electronic synergistic effect, the stress caused by lattice distortion from the Zn dopant embedded in Ni3FeN can alter the electronic environment of the peripheral regions and generate more catalytical active sites. The resultant Zn-Ni3FeN/NG exhibits a remarkable bifunctional electrochemical activity and stability, giving an overvoltage difference as low as 0.74 V. A Zn-air battery with Zn-Ni3FeN/NG as the air cathode shows an excellent cycle life and a high-power density of 158 mW cm(-2), exceeding that of the apparatus based on commercial Pt/C and RuO2 (120 mW cm(-2)). Density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that the inserted Zn2+ ions can modulate the electronic structure of Ni3FeN and modify the adsorption/desorption features and lower the overall reaction barriers during the oxygen electrocatalytic reaction. This study offers a facile strategy for the design of highly efficient oxygen bifunctional electrocatalysts for energy-related technology.									25	1	0	0	0	0	26			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000614172600031

These electrochemical reactions are crucial for desirable clean energy technologies, including advanced water electrolyzers, hydrogen fuel cells, and ammonia electrosynthesis and utilization. Their sluggish reaction kinetics lead to inefficient energy conversion. Innovative electrocatalysis, i.e., catalysis at the interface between the electrode and electrolyte to facilitate charge transfer and mass transport, plays a vital role in boosting energy conversion efficiency and providing sufficient performance and durability for these energy technologies. Herein, a comprehensive review on recent progress, achievements, and remaining challenges for these electrocatalysis processes related to water (i.e., oxygen evolution reaction, OER, and oxygen reduction reaction, ORR) and nitrogen (i.e., nitrogen reduction reaction, NRR, for ammonia synthesis and ammonia oxidation reaction, AOR, for energy utilization) is provided. Catalysts, electrolytes, and interfaces between the two within electrodes for these electrocatalysis processes are discussed. The primary emphasis is device performance of OER-related proton exchange membrane (PEM) electrolyzers, ORR-related PEM fuel cells, NRR-driven ammonia electrosynthesis from water and nitrogen, and AOR-related direct ammonia fuel cells.									136	8	0	0	2	0	136			0935-9648	1521-4095		WOS:000549734000001	32671924

The limiting oxygen diffusion current and effective number of electrons involved in oxygen electroreduction were determined. The limiting current and the number of electrons increased with the content of metal nanoparticles and transition to larger nanoparticles. The oxygen electroreduction occurs by the four-electron mechanism, whereby the hydrogen peroxide intermediate product does not accumulate, and oxygen is reduced directly to water molecules. The electrochemical reduction of the metal oxidation products and hydrogen evolution can be observed depending on the ionic form of the matrix.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1023-1935	1608-3342		WOS:000516575400011

However, it still remains challenges due to their uncontrollable factor at atomic level during the catalysts preparation, which requires the precise regulation of active sites and structure engineering to accelerate the reaction kinetics for both oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Herein, a novel Co-doped mixed lanthanum oxide and hydroxide heterostructure (termed as Co-LaMOH|OV@NC) was synthesized by pyrolysis of La-MOF-NH2 with spontaneous cobalt doping. Synergistic coupling of its hollow structure, doping effect and abundant oxygen vacancies creates more active sites and leads to higher electroconductivity, which contribute to the better performance. As employed as a bifunctional oxygen electrocatalyst, the resulting 3Co-LaMOH|OV@NC exhibits superior electrocatalytic activity for both ORR and OER. In assembled ZAB, it also demonstrates an excellent power density of 110.5 mW cm-2, high specific capacity of 810 mAh gZn-1, and good stability over 100 h than those of Pt/C + RuO2. Density functional theory (DFT) calculation reveals that the heterointerfaces coupled with oxygen vacancies lead to an enhanced charge state and electronic structure, which may optimize the conductivity, charge transfer, and the reaction process of catalysts. This study provides a new strategy for designing highly efficient bifunctional oxygen electrocatalysts based on rare earth oxide and hydroxides heterointerface.

Here, SR was used to guide the design of new oxide perovskite catalysts with improved oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activities. An unprecedentedly simple descriptor, mu/t, where mu and t are the octahedral and tolerance factors, respectively, was identified, which accelerated the discovery of a series of new oxide perovskite catalysts with improved OER activity. We successfully synthesized five new oxide perovskites and characterized their OER activities. Remarkably, four of them, Cs0.4La0.6Mn0.25Co0.75O3, Cs0.3La0.7NiO3, SrNi0.75Co0.25O3, and Sr0.25Ba0.75NiO3, outperform the current state-of-the-art oxide perovskite catalyst, Ba0.5Sr0.5Co0.8Fe0.2O3 (BSCF).

Herein, we develop an in-situ reduction and vulcanization strategy to prepare MoO2@MoS2@Co9S8 heterostructure nanorods by utilizing MoO3@ZIF-67 as a precursor. The reduction of MoO3 can produce more conductive MoO2, and the vulcanization reaction can produce highly active MoS2 for the HER as well as highly active Co9S8 for the OER. In addition, the MoS2 anchor on the MoO2 not only facilitates electron transfer, but also interacts with Co9S8 to induce a synergic catalytic effect by the electron transfer between them. Moreover, the 2D nanosheet assembled heterostructure nanorods can provide a large electrochemical surface area. Therefore, the merits of the materials are fully utilized and outstanding catalytic performances are achieved. MoO2@MoS2@Co9S8 can catalyze HER and OER effectively with overpotentials of 160 and 310 mV at 10 mA cm(-2), indicating its bifunctional activity. In addition, the two electrode electrolyzer catalyzed by MoO2@MoS2@Co9S8 can reach 10 mA cm(-2) current density at a cell voltage of 1.62 V with very high stability, demonstrating its practical application for water splitting.									32	2	0	0	0	0	32			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000613945500001

The reactive oxygen species (ROS) generated in atmospheric pressure plasmas have been believed to play a crucial role in these biomedical applications. The experimental measurement of the atomic oxygen density showed that the highest density was measured at an admixture of 0.5% of O-2. The similar trend of the atomic oxygen density varying the concentration of O-2 was reproduced through a global model of He/O-2 in atmospheric pressure plasmas. The evolution of the dominant production and loss reactions for the atomic oxygen was analyzed. With increase in the concentration of O-2, the atomic oxygen was produced mainly by the dissociation of O-2 and lost through the recombinations with themselves and oxygen molecules.									66	4	0	0	1	0	67			1612-8850	1612-8869		WOS:000276547700012

The influence of MSA concentration on OER is studied. EIS measurements highlighted the impact of the hydrated lead dioxide layer upon decreasing MSA or sulphuric acid concentration. The evolution of the Tafel curves plotted from EIS measurements and quasi-stationary currents while varying acid concentration was interpreted in the light of this hydrated layer which could enhance the electrocatalytic activity when it is thin, and on the contrary act as an electronic barrier when growing for low acid concentration. Both EIS and CVA revealed that OER on lead dioxide is less favoured in MSA than in sulphuric acid. It is finally concluded that a high-concentrated MSA electrolyte is better for lead acid flow battery application in terms of oxygen evolution. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Various methods have been investigated to obtain high catalytic activity, but the use of electronic structure regulation by incorporation of different elements is of particular simplicity and significance for development of a universal TMP synthesis method. We herein describe a novel approach for fabricating a series of TMPs by pyrolyzing phytic acid (PA) cross-linked metal complexes. The introduction of oxygen atoms into TMPs not only enhanced their intrinsic electrical conductivity, facilitating electron transfer, but activated active sites via elongating the M-P bond, favoring the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) or oxygen evolution reaction (OER). MoP exhibited relative low HER overpotentials of 118 mV and 93 mV while supporting a current density of 20 mA.cm(-2) in 0.5 M H2SO4 and 1 M KOH electrolytes, respectively. When CoP was applied as a catalyst for OER, only 280 mV overpotential was required to reach current density of 10 mA.cm(-2). Additionally, PA-containing precursors enabled intimate embedding of TMPs onto a flexible substrate surface (carbon cloth), so that electron injection from substrate and transport to the active sites was facilitated. Remarkably, an alkaline electrolyzer was able to achieve a current density of 40 mA.cm(-2) at the low voltage of 1.6 V, demonstrating its potential for practical overall water splitting without the use of noble metals.									541	29	0	0	21	0	546			0002-7863			WOS:000387625300028	27797511

In this paper, active cobalt-doped pyrite nanospheres with a porous structure are fabricated for the first time as advanced catalysts for water splitting in an alkaline solution. With the incorporation of cobalt atoms, the electronic structure of pyrite is well-tuned, with high conductivity as well as more active sites being obtained, which finally results in a superior bifunctional water splitting performance. Only 1.60 V is required to reach the current density of 10 mA cm(-2), which is smaller than that of other transition metal sulfides.									17	1	0	0	0	0	17			1144-0546	1369-9261		WOS:000511381800055

Without other metal incorporation, which was typically followed for enhancing the OER activity, the electrochemical performance was observed to be superior in comparison to all reported cobalt-based nanostructured metal phosphides. For anodic metamorphosis, these nanostructures, like all other metal phosphides, undergo surface oxidation but remain more active and superior to pure cobalt oxides as well as surface-oxidized different shaped monocobalt phosphides. Moreover, the synthesis was also followed by adopting a moderate synthetic protocol where PH3 gas was used as a phosphorus source and also scaled up to the gram level. In addition, the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) performance of these phosphides was further studied, and the performance was observed to be comparable to that in the best reports.									201	13	0	0	6	0	203			2380-8195			WOS:000389617700028

Iridium oxide exhibits the best available compromise between catalytic activity and stability in acid media, but it is prohibitively expensive for large-scale applications. Therefore, preparing oxygen-evolving catalysts with lower amounts of the scarce but active and stable iridium is an attractive avenue to overcome this economical constraint. Here we report on a class of oxygen-evolving catalysts based on iridium double perovskites which contain 32 wt% less iridium than IrO2 and yet exhibit a more than threefold higher activity in acid media. According to recently suggested benchmarking criteria, the iridium double perovskites are the most active catalysts for oxygen evolution in acid media reported until now, to the best of our knowledge, and exhibit similar stability to IrO2.									253	9	0	0	22	0	253			2041-1723			WOS:000380860000001	27498694

The catalysts performance for the oxygen evolution reaction was studied using cyclic voltammetry and their performance in a high temperature proton exchange membrane water electrolyser (PEMWE) examined. Physiochemical characterization was carried out to study the thermal stability, oxygen-metal bond formation, crystallinity phase and crystallite size, particle size and elemental analysis by TGA, FTIR, XRD, TEM and EDX respectively. The electrolyte used for electrochemical characterisation was 1.0 M H3PO4 and 0.5 M H2SO4. Additionally, the effect of calcination and electrolyte temperature on oxygen evolution reaction of RuO2 catalysts was studied and the apparent activation energy was determined using chronoamperometry. The prepared RuO2 were tested as anode catalyst in PEMWE in the temperature range of 120-150 degrees C using phosphoric acid doped polybenzimidazole membrane electrolyte. The physio-chemical and electrochemical characterization results indicate that RuO2 calcined at 500 degrees C gave the best performance with a current density of 0.875 A cm(-2) at 1.8 V in a PEMWE operated at 150 degrees C.

Therefore, the development of a sustainable technology for heavy metal recycling and reuse is essential. The present study proposed a new way to convert Cr(VI) into value-added biological Cr2O3 nanoparticles (bio-Cr(2)O(3 )NPs) with B. megaterium-secreted tryptophan residues proteins (TPN). In this process, Cr(VI) was reduced extracellularly to Cr(III) by B. megaterium without additional reductant and electron donors. This study overcomes the difficulty of separation of NPs and biomass, and realizes the recovery of bio-Cr2O3 NPS from biomass. The conversing efficiency of bio-Cr2O3 NPs reached the highest level (96.56%) at the concentration of 10 ppm Cr (VI). In particular, bio-Cr2O3 NPs exhibited excellent catalytic activity for both hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in 1 M KOH, outperforming chemically synthesized Cr-base catalysts. Three-dimensional matrix fluorescence (EEM), verification of tryptophan reduction and computation chemistry fully confirmed that TPN was responsible for the bio-Cr(2)O(3 )NPs formation. This comprehensive approach to bioremediation, synthesis NPs and recovery, as well as application will open a window for sustainable energy development and heavy metal pollution remediation.									11	0	0	0	5	0	11			0304-3894	1873-3336		WOS:000621665800012	33421882

There are great challenges to thermodynamically and kinetically enhance the electrocatalysis of OER. Here a thermo-selenization is presented to rationally tune the surface composition and largely evolve the structure of stainless steel (SS) for highly active sites toward OER. The modified SS remarkably delivers a high current density of 500 mA cm(-2) with only 293 mV overpotential and high stability for 96 h continuous operation at a current density of 500 mA cm(-2) with only similar to 10 mV increases of overpotential, which is superior to all reported SS based catalysts. The enhancement mechanism of the structural evolution toward OER is systematically investigated and supported by both experimental results and theoretical calculations. This work holds a great promise for a cost-effective, mass-production method to produce electrocatalysts toward OER, while offers fundamental insights to the enhancement mechanism of structure evolution for highly reconstructive reaction active sites in electrocatalysis.									27	2	0	0	2	0	28			2211-2855	2211-3282		WOS:000560729200008

Herein, through the selection of two different metal oxides with particular intrinsic features, advanced Co3O4/CeO2 nanohybrids (NHs) with CeO2 nanocubes anchored on Co3O4 nanosheets are developed, which show not only high oxygen vacancy concentration but also remarkable 2D electron gas (2DEG) behavior with approximate to 0.79 +/- 0.1 excess e(-)/u.c. on the Ce3+ sites at the Co3O4-CeO2 interface. Such a 2DEG transport channel leads to a high carrier density of 3.8 x 10(14) cm(-2) and good conductivity. Consequently, the Co3O4/CeO2 NHs demonstrate dramatically enhanced oxygen evolution reaction (OER) performances with a low overpotential of 270 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) and a high turnover frequency of 0.25 s(-1) when compared to those of pure Co3O4 and CeO2 counterparts, outperforming commercial IrO2 and some recently reported representative OER catalysts. These results demonstrate the validity of tailoring the electrocatalytic properties of metal oxides by 2DEG engineering, offering a step forward in the design of advanced hybrid nanostructures.									179	8	0	0	11	0	178			0935-9648	1521-4095		WOS:000474801000020	30957929

Herein, Pt/C (20%) is doped and inserted into the CoSSeNi catalyst through two steps of hydrothermal reaction and high temperature calcination process. Compared with the single metal Pt/C doped CoSSe-Pt/C, the bimetal doped CoSSeNi-Pt/C can greatly enhance the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) activity. The optimized Pt content in CoSSeNi-Pt/C is 2.25 wt%, which achieves the optimal HER and OER activity. The OER and HER overpotentials of CoSSeNi-Pt/C-0.3 nanosheets at 10 mA cm(-2) only required 295 mV and 180 mV, respectively. During the accelerated durability test, in the presence of Pt/C dopants, CoSSeNi-Pt/C catalyst exhibited excellent long-time durability in alkaline media. Meanwhile, CoSSeNi-Pt/C showed much higher DOS near the Fermi level and the higher electron density near the Fermi level would facilitate the adsorption of adsorbates.

Here we first report that Fe-leaching could induce the electrochemical activation of strongly coupled Ni-Fe alloy on N-doped carbon composites to boost the OER performance. It is demonstrated that the leaching of unstable FeOOH mixed layer from the surface of FeNi3 alloy is responsible for the surface reconstruction and exposure of more active sites. Furthermore, the N-doped carbon, FeNi3 alloy, together with the accompanying generation of Fe-doped Ni(OH)(2), synergistically promote the OER activity after fully activation. It is also verified that the high valent Ni species, pyridinic N and the metal-N species are the exact active centers and the fully activated catalyst Fe0.2Ni0.8/NC-600-a is among the best non-noble OER catalysts to date, which exhibits superior OER performance with a low overpotential (eta(20) = 290 mV) and small Tafel slope (76 mV dec(-1)). This study is helpful to understand the fundamentals of the Ni-Fe alloy catalysts and provides guidance to design advanced catalysts for water oxidation through in-situ electrochemical activation.									29	3	0	0	0	0	30			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000551901000043

The deposition of an oxygen evolution catalyst on the photoanode can enhance oxygen evolution, although the precise interplay between the semiconductor and the catalyst remains poorly understood and unoptimized. In this work, we use a combination of electrochemical approaches, including photoelectrochemical impedance spectroscopy and intensity modulated photocurrent spectroscopy, to unravel the nature of the interactions between different loadings of an electrocatalyst (CoFeOx) and a hematite (-Fe2O3) semiconductor. A thin layer of CoFeOx mainly reduces surface charge recombination, while an extremely thin layer enhances charge transfer kinetics. Moreover, an interlayer of GaOx modifies the surface state distribution and increases the charge transfer rate even further. These findings point to new opportunities for understanding and manipulating complex photoanodes for oxygen evolution.									84	6	0	0	7	0	85			1754-5692	1754-5706		WOS:000448339100021

The advantages that thin membranes offer include reduced mass transport resistance and ohmic resistance. A membrane electrode assembly (MEA) with a thinner membrane will have improved hydroxide ion transfer due to the shorter ion transfer pathway. We fabricated a MEA with a commercially available ultrathin A-901 membrane (9 mu m thick) and non-noble metal catalysts. We determined the efficiency and stability of this ultrathin membrane using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. The best performance recorded was 400 mA cm(-2) at 1.94 V at 50 degrees C. Over a period of 200 h, the voltage increase was only 200 mu V h(-1), which is < 60% that of the more commonly used A-201 membrane. The ultrathin A-901 membrane exhibited slightly higher performance compared to the A-201 for a given catalyst, catalyst loading, and electrolyte concentration. Acta 3030 (R) (CuCoOx) and Acta 4030 (R) (Ni/(CeO2-La2O3)/C) were employed as the oxygen evolution reaction and hydrogen evolution reaction catalysts, respectively.									22	1	0	0	0	0	23			1452-3981			WOS:000452744500002

It was found that the doped phosphorus played an important role in the formation of amorphous structure and improving active sites. The Ni-Fe-P electrocatalysts with the optimized phosphorus concentration exhibited the simultaneously enhanced HER and OER performances. Furthermore, NiFe-P electrocatalysts as the bifunctional electrodes displayed the excellent water splitting performance and durability with a cell potential of 1.71 V (on Cu sheet) and 1.59 V (on Ni foam) reaching 10 mA.cm(-2) significantly better than that of as-synthesized Ni-Fe alloys. Additionally, the boosting electrocatalytic performance was discussed in detail. The simultaneous improving HER and OER performances of Ni-Fe-P electrocatalyst might broaden the horizon in designing the highly efficient and earth-abundant electrocatalyst to produce hydrogen by electrocatalytic water splitting.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0022-3093	1873-4812		WOS:000793130500001

JIP-test, Q (A) (-) reoxidation kinetic test and S-state test were used in this study to study the energy distribution and electron transport in PSII. Treatment with Sb(V) at various concentrations ranging from 5 to 100 mg/l had long-term effects on growth, pigments content, and oxygen evolution of M. aeruginosa. Low concentration of Sb(V) had no significant inhibition of the biomass production and PSII activity but inhibited the pigment synthesis. Growth, pigments content, oxygen evolution, and PSII activity were seriously inhibited when treated by high concentration of Sb(V) (100 mg/l). The target sites of Sb(V) toxic effect on the PSII of M. aeruginosa were mainly on the donor side and the apparatus in the light-dependent reaction. The quantum yield for photochemistry, density of reaction centers and photosynthesis performance index decreased, whereas the dissipated energy increased. PSII activity of M. aeruginosa was promoted when exposure to 50 mg/l Sb(V) by increasing the density of active reaction centers and electron transport after Q (A) (-) .									12	1	0	0	12	0	12			0343-8651	1432-0991		WOS:000310073500014	22968687	
J	Xiong, Kun; Yu, Linjian; Xiang, Yang; Zhang, Haidong; Chen, Jia; Gao, Yuan								Cerium-incorporated Ni2P nanosheets for enhancing hydrogen production from overall water splitting and urea electrolysis								JOURNAL OF ALLOYS AND COMPOUNDS				912						165234	10.1016/j.jallcom.2022.165234				AUG 15 2022	2022	Hydrogen production from water splitting is a green and efficient technology for storing clean energy. Herein, cerium-incorporated Ni2P nanosheets are designed as trifunctional electrocatalysts to generate hydrogen by hydrothermal self-oxidation of surface nickel foam (NF) in pure water to in-situ form Ni(OH)2 nanosheets, followed by incorporation of Ce and phosphorization. The prepared material exhibits excellent electrocatalytic performance in hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and urea oxidation reaction (UOR). When the current density is 100 mA cm-2, the UOR potential of Ce-Ni2P is 1.473 V lower than that in the OER (1.731 V), suggesting a great potential to replace the sluggish OER for overall water splitting. Moreover, the Ce-Ni2P/NF can be applied to the electrochemical treatment of real urine electrolysis with similar performance to the urea electrolysis. Such remarkable performance is attributed to the incroporation of Ce with "Ce3+/Ce4+ redox pairs", which can not only provide abundant reactive sites by the charge transfer appearance of defect sites, but also offer an effective buffering space for the pre-oxidation process from Ni2+ to Ni3+. It is thus beneficial for overall water splitting and coupled urea electrolysis, providing a promising candidate for urine wastewater treatment and clean energy production. (c) 2022 Elsevier B.V.

Here, we have developed a minute-scale Fenton-like reaction to produce a three-dimensional (3D) FeOOH/NiFe-LDH heterojunction OER electrode by using industrial Ni foam as an Ni source to react directly with a Fenton-like reagent. The resulting 3D electrode, comprising a xlow-crystalline nano-scale FeOOH/NiFe-LDH heterojunction with high electrolyte-permeability, afforded a remarkable OER performances with an overpotential of 238 mV at 100 mA cm(-2), a Tafel slope of 28.9 mV dec(-1), and stable running over 700 h. Our results suggested that the fully maximized three-dimensional FeOOH/NiFe-LDH heterojunction interactions would be the origination of the high OER activity, exhibiting big prospects for industrial-scale applications.									15	0	0	0	0	0	15			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000700116100001

This paper will address the question of the first step, the formation of heavier elements such as carbon and oxygen from the primordial elemental abundance distribution in first stars. This nucleosynthesis can be facilitated by nuclear clustering of primordial isotopes in hot and highly convective first stars, provided that a helium rich or hydrogen depleted environment is available. The paper will summarize the associated nuclear reactions and the nucleosynthesis paths linking 4He to 12C. This will be based on an analysis of new experimental data for several of the anticipated nuclear reactions, and the role they might play at different temperature and density conditions in first star matter.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			1434-6001	1434-601X		WOS:000610425000004

Current non-noble metal oxide catalysts developed to drive oxygen evolution in alkaline solution have poor performance in neutral solutions. Here we report a highly active and stable oxygen evolution catalyst in neutral pH, Brownmillerite Sr2GaCoO5, with the specific activity about one order of magnitude higher than that of widely used iridium oxide catalyst. Using Sr2GaCoO5 to catalyze oxygen evolution, the integrated CO2 reduction achieves the average solar-to-CO efficiency of 13.9% with no appreciable performance degradation in 19 h of operation. Our results not only set a record for the efficiency in sunlight-driven CO2 reduction, but open new opportunities towards the realization of practical CO2 reduction systems.									34	1	0	0	1	0	34			2041-1723			WOS:000484779500009	31501446

Traditional catalyst fabrication methods include the carbonization of ordered templates and high-temperature dehydration. All these methods involve complicated meso-structural disordering and allow little control over morphology. To this end, a eutectic GaInSn alloy (EGaInSn) was proposed and employed as an intermediate to fabricate low-dimensional ordered catalyst support materials. Owing to the lower Gibbs free energy of Ga2O3 compared to certain types of metals (e.g., Al, Mn, Ce, etc.), we found that a skinny layer of metal oxides could be formed and exfoliated into a two-dimensional nanosheet at the interface of liquid metal (LM) and water. As such, EGaInSn was herein employed as a reaction matrix to synthesize a range of two-dimensional catalyst supports with large specific surface areas and structural stability. As a proof-of-concept, Al2O3 and MnO were fabricated with the assistance of LM and were used as catalyst supports for loading Ru, demonstrating enhanced structural stability and overall electrocatalytic performance in the oxygen evolution reaction. This work opens an avenue for the development of functional support materials mediated by LM, which would play a substantial role in electrocatalytic reactions and beyond.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0				2079-4991		WOS:000824226500001	35807989

The most important factor in the synthesis of SACs is the selection of appropriate support and formation of metal-support interaction. Among a large number of nanomaterials, MXenes can be utilized as benign supports for fixing SACs because of their expansive specific surface area, regulable bandgap, superior electronic conductivity, and strong mechanical stability. The structure and property of MXenes can be manipulated by changing transition metal elements and surface termination. Here, the uniqueness and superiority of MXenes as superexcellent supports for confining SACs are analyzed from structure and property. The synthetic strategy of MXene-supported SACs is also summarized, especially emphasizing the immobilization of isolated atom against aggregation by utilizing the formidable metal-support covalent coordination interaction. In addition, the applications of MXene-supported SACs in electrocatalytic field are highlighted, including hydrogen evolution reaction, oxygen evolution reaction, overall water splitting, oxygen reduction reaction, and nitrogen reduction reaction.

We focus on their energy applications in electrocatalysis of the oxygen reduction reaction, the oxygen evolution reaction, the hydrogen evolution reaction, CO2 reduction reactions, photocatalytic water splitting and CO2 reduction, electrical double layer capacitors, pseudocapacitors, and batteries. Effects of synthesis parameters and surface modification are examined as a means to tune conductivity, catalytic activity, and other performance-related properties. Activity parameters of leading 2D materials and their hybrids are discussed and compared with more classical benchmark materials to provide an evolutionary perspective of performance progress. Doped graphenes are currently producing about half their theoretical electrostatic maximum energy storage in electrical double layer capacitors at about 260 F g(-1). Nanosheet pseudocapacitors have yielded significant early advances in hybrids of graphene with layered double hydroxides and with metal oxide nanosheets to store energy at about 3000 F g(-1). These pseudocapacitor results also have enabled promising early developments in using similar electrodes in batteries. Nanosheet hybrid structures are also yielding improved electrodes for lithium and sodium ion batteries. High electrical conductivity, robustly porous nanosheet assemblies, and facile ionic and molecular diffusion pathways are design criteria important for nanosheet-based energy conversion and storage materials.

Herein, taking the graphene-confining single-atom M-N-4 motif as an example, we explored the effect of a graphene edge (armchair and zigzag configurations) on their bifunctional ORR and OER activities. It is clarified that the symmetry breaking of the M-N-4 motif around the edge has a potential influence on the intermediates' adsorption and thermodynamic pictures. Based on the evaluation of the electrochemical step symmetry index (ESSI) and bifunctional index (BI), Co-N-4 and Rh-N-4 motifs at the armchair edge with BIs of 0.49 and 0.61 V are predicted as optimal bifunctional catalytic sites for the ORR/OER due to the d-band modulation from the edge environment. Our results unfold the effect of the graphene edge on the oxygen-involving electrocatalytic mechanism and provide a clear theoretical guidance for the design of bifunctional oxygen electrode materials in reversible fuel cells, electrolyzers, and rechargeable metal-air batteries.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			1932-7447	1932-7455		WOS:000735966900001

Absolute evolution rates as well as volume fractions of Cl-2 and O-2 were quantified using differential electrochemical mass spectrometry (DEMS), while the catalyst surface redox behavior was analyzed using cyclic voltammetry. The spatial inhomogeneity of the surface catalytic reaction rate was probed using Scanning Electrochemical Microscopy (SECM). Although the nature of the competition between electrochemical discharging of chloride ions and water molecules remains elusive on a molecular scale, new insights into the spatial reactivity distribution of the CER and OER were obtained. Oxidation of water is the initial step in corrosion and concomitant deactivation of the oxide electrodes; however, at the same time the nature of interaction between the oxide surface and water is used as a rational indicator of selectivity and catalytic activity. An experimental procedure was established that would allow the study of selectivity of a variety of different catalyst materials using polycrystalline electrode surfaces.									70	1	0	0	5	0	72			1463-9076	1463-9084		WOS:000338116700023	24752521

In the spinel structure of the electrospun Co2RhO4 nanotubes, Co3+ cations and Rh3+ cations randomly occupy the octahedral sites, while the remaining half of the Co2+ cations occupy the centres of the tetrahedral sites as proved by microscopic and spectroscopic observations. Furthermore, electrospun spinel Co2RhO4 nanotubes exhibit excellent catalytic performances with the least positive onset potential, greatest current density, and low Tafel slope which are even better than those of the commercial Ir/C electrocatalyst for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in alkaline solution. Our demonstration of significantly enhanced OER activity with a single phase of electrospun spinel Co2RhO4 nanotubes thus opens up the broad applicability of our synthetic methodology for accessing new OER catalysis.									17	2	0	0	1	0	17			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000468868200006	31049518

To further explore the potential of CoP in hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER), we utilize vertical graphene nanohills (VGNHs) that are known to enhance catalytic performances through super-aerophobicity. Unique CoP chrysanthemum-like structures are formed on VGNHs through a facile, one-step electrodeposition reaction. Because of the highly conductive VGNH support and the modified CoP nanostructures, the optimized CoP/VGNHs hybrid catalyst exhibits excellent electrocatalytic activities toward HER in 0.5 M H2SO4, such as a low overpotential at 10 mA cm(-2) (eta(10)) of 51 mV, a small Tafel slope of 36 mV dec(-1), and a long-term stability. Specifically, the overpotential at 100 mA cm(-2) (eta(100)) is merely 125 mV, an outstanding performance for a noble metal-free catalyst. Furthermore, the HER performance in 1.0 M KOH (eta(10) of 93 mV) and the OER performance in the same alkaline medium (eta(10) of 300 mV) are highly competitive, making CoP/VGNHs also an excellent bifunctional electrocatalyst yielding a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at a low voltage of 1.63 V. This novel nanostructure offers an efficient strategy for the development of nonprecious metal catalysts for water electrolysis.									25	2	0	0	0	0	25			2168-0485			WOS:000460600500006

Herein, a mesoporous CoS/MoS2 polyhedron is synthesized for in situ embedded with CeO2 nanoparticles (denoted as CeO2@CoS/MoS2). Electrochemical experimental results indicate that dispersion of a proper amount of CeO2 (20 wt%) cocatalyst on the interface of CoS/MoS2 has activated abundant Co/Mo sites and induced oxygen vacancies/defects to boost the OER activity. 20%CeO2@CoS/MoS2 displays excellent OER electrocatalytic performance in alkaline with an overpotential of 247 mV to reach the current density of 10 mA cm-2 and a Tafel slope of 64 mV dec-1. More importantly, the embedded CeO2 particles have effectively prevented the binary metal sulfide from corrosion through Ce3+/Ce4+ switching, thus enhancing its stability and displaying a 12-hours continuous OER electrocatalysis at 10 mA cm-2. Our result represents one of rare examples by assembling cocatalyst within mesoporous hetero-structural binary sulfides to improve the electrocatalytic performance for OER.									29	1	0	0	3	0	29			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000664793400002

Different reaction sites (Fe, Co, Ni, and an oxygen vacancy) were investigated at three terminations: the B-layer with octahedrally coordinated Co/Ni and with an additional half and full monolayer of Fe (0.5A and A-layer, respectively). Ni substitution with an equal concentration of Co and Ni (x = 0.5) reduces the overpotential over the end members for the majority of reaction sites. Surface Co cations are identified as the active sites and the ones at the A-layer termination for x = 0.5 exhibit one of the lowest theoretically reported overpotentials of 0.26 V. The effect of the additional iron layer on the active site modification is 2-fold: analysis of the electronic properties and spin densities indicates that the additional Fe layer stabilizes a bulk-like oxidation state of +2 for Co and Ni at the A-layer termination, whereas at the B-layer termination, they are oxidized to 3+. Moreover, the unusual relaxation pattern enables the formation of a hydrogen bond of the OOH intermediate to a neighboring surface oxygen that lowers the reaction free energy of this formerly rate-limiting step, leading to a deviation from the scaling relationship and almost equidistant reaction free-energy steps of intermediates. This renders an example of how a selective surface modification can result in a significant improvement of OER performance.									40	3	0	0	0	0	40			2155-5435			WOS:000453491100078

In this field, understanding the role of electronic structure of catalysts on catalytic activity is essential but still lacking. Herein, a family of pyrochlore oxides R2Ir2O7 (R = rare earth ions) is reported as acidic oxygen-evolving catalysts with superior-specific activities. More importantly, it is found that the intrinsic activity of this material significantly increases with the R ionic radius. Electronic structure studies reveal that the increased R ionic radius weakens electron correlations in these iridate oxides. This weakening induces an insulator-metal transition and an enhancement of Ir-O bond covalency, both of which promote oxygen evolution kinetics. This work demonstrates the importance of engineering the electron correlations to rationalize the catalytic activity toward water oxidation in strongly correlated transition-metal oxides.									64	6	0	0	4	0	64			0935-9648	1521-4095		WOS:000459630600008	30549113

Although transition metal-based phosphide catalysts have been widely studied as effective catalysts for the HER and OER, their catalytic applications are significantly limited by low electrical conductivity and the agglomeration effect. Herein we report a highly active electrocatalyst for HER and OER comprising CoP nanoparticles embedded in CNT-grafted carbon nanofibers (CNF@CoP-CNTs) obtained by the pyrolysis of a cobalt metal-organic framework (ZIF-67) in a reductive H-2 atmosphere and subsequent adjustable phosphating process. The optimized CNF@CoP-CNTs showed excellent HER and OER performance, evidenced by the small overpotentials of 65 mV @ 10 mA cm(-2) for HER and 367 mV @ 50 mA cm(-2) for OER. Remarkably, the CNF@CoP-CNTs can also display excellent long-term stability for more than 48 h for the OER test in an alkaline medium. In short, this research demonstrates that CNF@CoP-CNTs with a hierarchical structure could be a potential electroactive material in advanced electrocatalysts systems.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2398-4902			WOS:000870373300001

Herein, a hierarchical porous NiS@NiO nanoarray with a large surface area was prepared in situ on nickel (Ni) foam as a water-splitting catalyst via a simple hydrothermal method. The core-shell NiS@NiO/NF hybrid exhibits an excellent bifunctional performance with low overpotentials of 150 and 319 mV to achieve an HER current density of 10 mA cm(-2) and a large OER current density of 100 mA cm(-2), respectively, in the 1.0 M KOH solution because of its high specific surface area and the interface between the two phases. Furthermore, NiS@NiO/NF exhibits a cell voltage of 1.54 V for overall water splitting and extremely high stability for more than 50 h at 10 mA cm(-2).

In this regard, anion-exchange membrane (AEM) electrolysis is the technology of best choice due to its compactness and high efficiency. Here, we proposed a low cost electrocatalyst composed of cadmium sulfide (CdS) nanoparticles decorated in a Cobalt-based metal-organic framework (CdS/ZIF-67), synthesized using a simple coprecipitation method. Compared with pristine Cobalt-based metal-organic framework (ZIF-67), 5 wt%CdS/ZIF-67 has excellent electrochemical oxygen evolution reaction activity, low overpotential (294 mV), low Tafel-slope (100 mV dec(-1)), higher mass activity (25.8 mA mg(-1)), and better stability. The AEM electrolyzer with the 5 wt%CdS/ZIF-67 anode can attain a potential of 1.85 V at a current-density of 1 A cm(-2), which is lower than that of bare Cobalt-based metal-organic framework electrolyzers. Thus, these catalysts are not only very active but also scalable, making them a promising electrolyzer for application in commercial power market.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			0378-7753	1873-2755		WOS:000782426900001

Herein, we present a facile method to fabricate lanthanides (L = La, Eu, Yb)-doped graphene materials as catalyst for the HER and ORR that show desirable electrocatalytic activities as well as long-term stability. The Eu-graphene hybrid has showed unbeatable HER performance such as small values of onset potential (81 mV), overpotential (160 mV), and Tafel slope (52 mV dec(-1)), along with a high exchange current density (7.55 x 10(-6)A cm(-2)). The L-graphenes also exhibit superior electrocatalytic activity for ORR, including small Tafel slopes (96, 66, and 105 mV dec(-1) for La-Gr, Eu-Gr, and Yb-Gr, respectively), positive onset potential (similar to 0.83-0.92V), high electron transfer numbers (similar to 3.84-4.03), and excellent enduring strength, analogous to those of viable Pt/C catalysts. The excellent electrocatalytic performance is attributed to the synergistic effect of abundant edges and doping sites, high electrical conductivity, large active surface areas and fast charge transfer; which renders lanthanide-based graphene hybrids as potentially great candidate for energy conversion systems.

However, the natural scarcity and high cost greatly hamper their large-scale commercialization. The combination of graphene shell with metal core could tune the electronic structure of carbon active sites. Recently, nitrogen doped graphene encapsulated metal or alloy (M@NG) has emerged as novel and fascinating electrocatalysts. In this review, we focus on some recent advances in designing M@NG electrocatalysts for HER, OER and ORR through tuning electronic structure and activity of carbon active sites. We have summarized some facile and universal strategy for synthesizing various M@NG via direct annealing of metal-organic frameworks (MOFs). With elaborated MOFs precursor design, careful control over the nitrogen doping level, metal element types and alloy structure, the electronic structure of carbon active sites can be rationally tuned to optimize activity for different electrochemical reactions. We hope this review can provide new insights into the design of M@NG with high catalytic activity.									4	1	0	0	0	0	4			1001-604X	1614-7065		WOS:000685069200037

Here, we report a facile and effective strategy for the rational design and construction of three-dimensional (3D) architectures for superior electrocatalysis through the integration of one-dimensional (1D) electrospun carbon nanofibers (CNFs), 1D carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and 0D oxygen-deficient Mn3Co7-Co2Mn3O8 nanoparticles (NPs). The rationale behind the marriage and integration of nanostructures with different dimensions presented in this work is that during heat treatment, the in situ-produced CoMnO NPs are partly reduced to Co2Mn3O8 by a carbon precursor with an amount of metallic Mn3Co7 formed at the interface between the Co2Mn3O8 NPs and carbon, which can act as the catalysts for the growth of 3D CNT forests. The 3D CoMnO@CNT/CNF architectures exhibit superior electrocatalytic activity and stability for the oxygen reduction, oxygen evolution and hydrogen evolution reactions. The remarkable electrochemical properties are mainly attributed to the synergistic effects from the engineering of oxygen-deficient binary CoMn oxide NPs with exposed active sites and 3D hierarchical porous structures consisting of branched CNTs and interconnected CNFs. The present work demonstrates the first example of integrating multiple active catalytic centers onto/into 3D architectures for developing highly efficient non-precious metal nanocatalysts for electrochemical energy devices.									93	5	0	0	2	0	93			1754-5692	1754-5706		WOS:000395208000029

Transition metal-containing perovskite oxide is attractive in this regard. The OER on such perovskite oxide in an alkaline solution is nonetheless often limited by proton transfer step. To overcome such limitation, here we apply mixed protonic-electronic conductor BaCo(0.8-x)FexZr(0.1)Y(0.1)O(3) (x = 0, 0.2, and 0.4) as an OER catalyst. Among these three, BaCo0.8Zr0.1Y0.1O3 (BC(0.8)ZY) in particular shows the lowest OER overpotential, the lowest Tafel slope, the highest OER mass activity, and the highest OER specific activity, which surpass those of Ba0.5Sr0.5Co0.8Fe0.2O3-delta (BSCF) benchmark. Using O-2-temperature programmed desorption, impedance spectroscopy, and O1s X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, we attribute such superior OER performance to the highest oxygen desorption capacity, the lowest charge transfer resistance, and the highest hydroxide species content for BC(0.8)ZY. We also demonstrate that the OER current of BC(0.8)ZY exhibits a first-reaction order dependence to the solution pH between 12.5 and 14, which confirms its proton transfer rate-determining step.

Thence, we report a ponderable and accomplished method to fabricate active bifunctional electrocatalysts, in which hydrangea-like NiFe LDH sulfide nanosheets are supported on a hill-like nickel framework (NiFe LDH-Ni-S/NF). This optimal NiFe LDH-Ni-S/NF electrode exhibits excellent electrochemical properties in an alkaline medium, which requires 256 mV to fulfill a current density of 100 mA/cm(2) for the OER and 94 mV to reach 10 mA/cm(2) for the HER. An electrochemical water splitting appliance uses this bifunctional electrocatalyst as both anode and cathode, exhibiting a small cell potential (1.56 V@10 mA/cm(2)). Besides, the water electrolyzer can suffer a long time of 20 h at 10 mA/cm(2), showing the feasibility in a practical unbiased alkaline water splitting system. (C) 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

Herein, we constructed an oxygen vacancy-rich and highly reactive (222) facet in Co3O4 nanocrystals anchored on carbon nitride nanofiber (CNF) by a solvothermal reduction method. The resulting Co3O4 nanocrystals/CNF (COCNF) demonstrated a dramatically enhanced OER with a rate of 24.9 mu mol/h under visible light, which is 124 times higher than that of CNF. This excellent catalytic activity of COCNF is based on a synergistic effect between its binary components for charge separation, oxygen vacancies for enhanced conductivity, and facet (222) exposure of Co3O4 nanocrystals for improved heterogeneous kinetics. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations revealed the water oxidation mechanism at different facets and found that the formed oxygen vacancies lead to a reduction of the materials bandgap. The correlation between Co3O4 crystal facets and the inherent OER catalytic activities under acidic solution was in the order of (222) > (220) > (311).									26	0	0	0	3	0	26			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000579956100020	32921050

The phase evolution and reaction mechanism during the reaction were investigated. The mixed gas evolution of CO, CO2 and N-2 were observed in the heat-treatment of Ta3N5/SrCO3. The SrTaO2N product possessed an average particle size of 330 nm in a narrow distribution with the stoichiometric oxygen and nitrogen content. Its ceramics with various relative density were also fabricated by pressureless sintering of the as-prepared SrTaO2N powder, showing a high sinterability.

In this paper, NiFe layered double hydroxide (LDH) nanosheets were grown on Ni foam (NF) through a straightforward hydrothermal method. The Fe doping effects were systemati-cally investigated by controlling Ni/Fe ratios and Fe valence states, and the in-depth in-fluence mechanisms were discussed. The results indicate that, through controlling structure morphology and enhancing Ni2+ oxidation, NiFeIII(1:1)-LDH displays the best and outstanding OER performance, with a low over potential of 382 mV at 50 mA cm-2, a low Tafel slope of 31.1 mVdec-1 and only 20 mV increase after 10 h continuous test at 50 mA cm-2. To our knowledge, this is one of the best OER electrocatalysts in alkaline media to date.

Herein, cobalt hydroxide carbonate (CCH) has been used as a model to demonstrate the boost of its oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity by atomic doping of W6+(W-CCH). The 5 at % W doping reduced the OER overpotential of CCH by 95.3 mV at 15 mA cm(-2), and increased the current density by 2.8 times at 1.65 V. 5%W-PCCH parallel to 5%W-CCH-based electrolyzer only required a potential of 1.65 V to afford 10 mA cm(-2) for full water splitting. The W6+ in CCH are active sites for O-2(-) adsorption and induced an incesaed electron density near the Fermi level, which facilitates the charge transfer during electrocatalysis. The W6+ doping has been validated as an efficient booster for transition-metal carbonate hydroxides-based electrocatalysts, which has half or more than half-filled d-bands. (c) 2020 Elsevier Inc.

The physical and optical properties of these photocatalysts were characterized by X-ray diffraction, X-ray absorption fine structure, UV-visible diffuse reflectance spectra, and the band structure along with density of states were calculated by the plane-wave-based density functional theory. The photocatalytic activity of oxygen evolution from water was evaluated under visible light irradiation. The Mo doping significantly increased the photocatalytic activity of Ca2NiWO6. The optimal Ca2NiW0.97Mo0.03O6 showed an oxygen evolution rate approximately 2 times higher than that of the pure Ca2NiWO6. The characterization results indicated that the Mo-doped Ca2NiWO6 maintained the double perovskite structure. The Mo6+ ions were substituted into the W6+ sites in the lattice, causing a certain amount of lattice distortion and promoting the formation of oxygen vacancies. Furthermore, the Mo doping introduced impurity energy levels into the band structure of Ca2NiWO6. Consequently, the conduction band changed from discrete to continuous and the bottom of the conduction band was shifted to more positive potential, compared to that of pure Ca2NiWO6, leading to a lower band gap and higher absorbance in the wider visible light region. These characteristics are responsible for the high photocatalytic activity of the oxygen evolution reaction.									10	1	0	0	0	0	11			2046-2069			WOS:000393754100033

Traditional anode materials have been relatively low-cost lead alloys, though the active lead dioxide layer has a high oxygen evolution overpotential. This causes a significant increase of cell voltage. To lower total energy use in metal production, electrocatalytical properties or corrosion resistance to decrease replacement costs must be improved. Addition of an catalyzing ion will decrease oxygen evolution potential. The effective area of an anode increases by calcium additions and by producing anodes with fine microstructure.

High-resolution transmission electron microscopy indicates the appearance of an amorphous layer after the electrochemical reaction. We conclude that the formation of the amorphous layer at the surface, induced by Sr doping, is crucial for achieving high OER activity, and we offer insights into the self-reconstruction of the OER catalyst.

Herein, we design and construct a bifunctional N-doped electrocatalyst, which is made up of cobalt (Co) driven from VB12 (Co-containing porphyrin) and nanoscaled molybdenum carbide (Mo2C) anchored on N-doped carbon (VB12Mo@NC). The synergistic interaction between the Co and Mo2C nanoparticles in the carbon matrix, along with the high electrochemical surface area of the electrocatalyst greatly altered the catalytic activity of the electrocatalyst for both HER and OER in alkaline medium (1M KOH). At 10 mA cm(-2), the as-synthesized VB12Mo@NC possessed a minimal overpotential of 195 and 396 mV for HER and OER, respectively. Its electrochemical activity is analogous to most hitherto reported Co-Mo-based electrocatalysts for HER and OER. This work provides a simple and productive synthesis scheme for a stable non-noble metal electrocatalyst, which has great activity for water splitting.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			0363-907X	1099-114X		WOS:000625174300001

However, high cost performance oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalysts become the key to realize the industry-scale hydrogen production from water electrolysis. Herein, we for the first time report a polymetallic transition metal phosphide (Fe2P-NiCoP) catalyst derived from iron-containing metal-organic frameworks (MIL-88A) and NiCo-LDH as double precursors, effectively driving the OER in alkaline media. Experimental and density functional theory (DFT) calculation results verify that, the NiOOH/FeOOH, as real active site for OER generated by Fe2P-NiCoP reconstruction, reduces the adsorption energy of oxygen-containing intermediates and accelerate the reaction kinetics. As expected, only 239 and 260 mV overpotentials are required to reach current densities of 20 and 50 mA cm(-2) in 1 M KOH solutions, which is far better than commercial RuO2 toward OER. Besides, Fe2P-NiCoP also achieves long-term stability up to 100 h, providing the possibility of commercial large-scale applications. Furthermore, it still obtains the outstanding activity in direct electrolysis of alkaline seawater, with only 258 and 278 mV overpotentials needed to reach current densities of 20 and 50 mA cm(-2), respectively. Undoubtedly, Fe2P-NiCoP is one of the most promising non-noble metal electrocatalysts for practical hydrogen production from water splitting. (c) 2022 Elsevier Ltd.

Complicated electrochemical reactions and product transformations occur in the cell during mode switching. Thus, identifying dynamic behaviors during this procedure can improve cell durability and system design. In this study, the dynamic behaviors of cell voltage and electrochemical reaction during the switch from the FC mode to the WE mode are experimentally investigated. Reactant switching time significantly affects the electrochemical reactions. The water pumped into the cell in the FC mode reduces the cell voltage to a negative value and results in a hydrogen evolution reaction at the oxygen electrode side. Before FC mode voltage rapid decrease caused by supplied water, current transition could efficiently avoided the hydrogen evolution reaction at oxygen side. Ensuring that the moment water reaches the channels is close to the moment of current transition can improve the stability of unitized regenerative FCs. (C) 2018 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC.

Herein, the electronic state of the MnO2 sheets assembled on nickel foams by hydrothermal reaction was tuned by the intercalated transition metal ions including Fe, Co and Ni. Cationic intercalation leads to the convert of manganese ions from a stable d(3) (Mn4+) state to an unstable high-spin d(4) state (Mn3+), and the reduction of the average chemical state of Mn species greatly increases the density of oxygen vacancies in the material, thereby improving the adsorption capacity of the material for free -OH when performing a catalytic reaction. Due to its higher valence state and oxidation activity, Fe3+ showed higher diffusion control contribution and produced more redox active sites in MnO2, which is in an advantageous position among all ions embedded in the MnO2 layer. Then achieving current density of 20 mA cm(-2) on Fe-MnO2/NF only requires a driving voltage of 330 mV for OER. This work not only established a method to activate the self-generated oxygen vacancies by using electronic effects, but also provided new ideas for improving the OER performance of MnO2.									18	0	0	0	3	0	18			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000653229500005

Among all electrochemical energy storage devices, metal-air batteries have potential to offer the highest energy density, representing the most promising systems for portable (electronics), mobile (electrical vehicles), and stationary (micro-grids) applications. To date, however, many fundamental issues are yet to be overcome to realize this potential. For example, efficient catalysts for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) at the air-electrode are yet to be developed to significantly reduce the polarization loss in metal-air batteries, which severely hinders the rate capability, energy efficiency, and operational life. In this progress report, a brief overview is first presented of the critical issues relevant to air-electrodes in metal-air batteries. Some recent advancements in the development of non-precious catalysts for ORR in Li-air and Zn-air batteries are then highlighted, including transition metal oxides, low-dimensional carbon-based structures, and other catalysts such as transition-metal macrocycles and metal nitrides. New directions and future perspectives for metal-air batteries are also outlined.									564	34	0	0	25	0	575			1614-6832	1614-6840		WOS:000306311100008

Herein, a 2D-3D nanostructure composed of metal hydroxides and Prussian blue analogus (PBA) was in-situ decorated onto the NiFe foam (Pt-NiFe PBA) through a facile and scalable corrosive-coordinate approach. The specifically designed morphology favored the provision of abundant active sites, optimized the reaction pathway, and accelerated mass transport during the electrocatalytic process. Consequently, the as-synthesized Pt-NiFe PBA reached 10 mA cm(-2) with small overpotentials of 29 and 210 mV in 1 mol L-1 KOH deionized water for HER and OER, respectively. Remarkably, Pt-NiFe PBA required an overpotential of 21 mV to drive 10 mA cm(-2) in seawater containing 1 mol L-1 KOH with prominent durability. Moreover, with the as-synthesized Pt-NiFe PBA as bifunctional electrocatalyst, the Pt-NiFe PBA parallel to Pt-NiFe PBA electrolyzer needed 1.46 and 1.48 V to drive 10 mA cm(-2) in 1 mol L-1 KOH with deionized water and 1 mol L-1 KOH with seawater, respectively. Remarkably, sustainable energies were utilized to power the overall water splitting and stored as easily portable hydrogen energy.									16	0	0	0	0	0	16			2095-8226	2199-4501		WOS:000740190200001

Herein, we develop a method to synthesize uniform nitrogen-doped bamboo-like carbon nanotubes (NBCNT) encapsulated with NiFeP nanoparticles (NiFeP@NBCNT). When the as-fabricated nanocomposites are used to catalyze the OER, it exhibits exceptionally high activity in alkaline solution (180 mV @10 mA cm(-2) and a low Tafel slope of 59 mV dec(-1)) and outstanding long-term stability. The turnover frequency (TOF) for NiFeP@NBCNT at an overpotential of 350 mV are calculated to 3.38 s(-1). The OER reaction mechanism on the NiFeP@NBCNT modified electrode is explored by comparing the XPS spectra before and after electrochemical OER testing. The excellent catalytic properties make NiFeP@NBCNT a promising candidate for electrochemical catalysis in water splitting. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

The metallic Co nanoparticles with a large number of exposed active sites are distributed uniformly and adhere firmly to the VN substrate to enhance the OER efficiency, facilitate fast charge transfer, and improve the stability. As a result, a small overpotential of 320 mV is required to achieve a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) with a small Tafel slope of 55 mV dec(-1). The excellent stability is indicated by an overpotential shift of only 34 mV after 2000 cyclic voltammetry cycles at a large current density of 200 mA cm(-2).

Herein, 3d, 4d, and 5d single transition metal atom supported C4N catalysts (TM-C4N) are explored using density functional theory methods. First, seven thermodynamically stable TM-C4N (TM = Sc, Ti, V, Mn, Cu, Y, and Ag) are identified. Next, the calculated Delta G(*H) values reveal that all screened TM-C4N materials exhibit considerable catalytic performance for the HER. Besides, the ORR and OER activities of all screened TM-C4N materials are inferior to those of Pt(111) and Ru-/IrO2(110). Considering that the binding strength of *OH limits the catalytic performance of most TM-C4N, high-valent metal complexes (TM-OH-C4N) are further studied. Owing to the modification of OH, the binding strength of reaction species on most TM-OH-C4N is weakened, thereby improving the performance of the ORR and OER. In particular for Cu-OH-C4N, the overpotentials for the ORR and OER (0.61 and 0.48 V, respectively) are closest to those of Pt(111) and Ru-/IrO2(110), manifesting that it exhibits good bifunctional catalytic activity. Additionally, the variation trend of Delta E-*OH on TM-C4N and TM-OH-C4N can be appropriately described by the intrinsic descriptor phi.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1463-9076	1463-9084		WOS:000870764000001	36268782

We report the synthesis of 3-D interconnected pristine graphene supported NiO nanosheets via in situ self-assembly. Its overpotential at 10 mA cm(-2 )is 320 mV and Tafel slope is 52.4 mV dec(-1), both of which are low er than most reported values of NiO-based catalysts and even Ir and Ru-based ones. It exhibits only a slight loss of the current density after 20 h of chronoamperometric measurement at an overpotential of 320 mV (from 10.09 to 9.62 mA cm( -2)) and a small increase after 1000 CV cycles (from 41.47 to 46.01 m A cm(-2 )at 1.58 V). The synthesis of NiO nanosheets on graphene offers key insights into the self-assembly mechanism. The reported in situ self-assembly of metal oxide nanostructures with 3-D architecture on graphene is a low-cost, facile and mild strategy for making high-performance OER catalyst demonstrating the advantages of 3-D interconnected nanostructures supported on graphene.

Herein, an efficient oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalyst composed of a unique porous tunnel carbon cube and cobalt nanoparticles (Co@NPCC) was fabricated to facilitate oxygen diffusion and create electron conduction networks. As an OER catalyst for zinc-air batteries (ZABs), the resulting Co@NPCC demonstrate enhanced OER activity, similar to that of the benchmark RuO2. In OER performance, Co@NPCC exhibits the excellent mass activity of 49.9 mA mg(-1) at overpotential (eta) of 0.47 V and the high current density of 91.5 mA cm(-2) at 1.75 V (vs RHE), compared to commercial RuO2 catalysts. The use of Co@NPCC as the OER catalyst for ZAB maintains stable charge overpotential with as little as 0.05 V variation during 250 cycles, which extends the stable discharge-charge cycle performance compared to RuO2. This work highlights a facile approach to fabricate OER catalysts without noble metals for enabling stable charge state and long life ZABs.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0363-907X	1099-114X		WOS:000734785100001

Herein, we report a one-pot pyrolysis strategy to construct binary transition metal oxide (TMO) interfaces on a nitrogen doped porous carbon framework (CN) for bifunctional oxygen reaction catalysis. The constructed Fe3O4/Co3O4 interfaces not only help promote the stabilization of Fe2+ ions, but also generate abundant oxygen vacancies on the surface of composite catalysts (Fe3O4/Co3O4-CN), which boost the intrinsic oxygen reaction activity. The Fe3O4/Co3O4-CN catalyst exhibits a bifunctional electrocatalytic performance with a significantly lowered potential difference (Delta E) of 0.68 V between the half-wave potential of the ORR (E-1/2) and the potential of the OER at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) (E-j=10), rivaling the best performance of previously reported bifunctional TMO catalysts to the best of our knowledge. The rechargeable Zn-air battery with Fe3O4/Co3O4-CN as the cathode catalyst exhibits superior performance with an energy density of 1045.82 W h kg(Zn)(-1) and a peak power density of 105.7 mW cm(-2), as well as excellent cycling stability (over 80 h at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2)), demonstrating our new bifunctional oxygen electrocatalyst as a promising candidate for practical energy storage applications.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			2398-4902			WOS:000652176900001

In this mechanistic study of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalyzed by cobalt-intercalated layered MnO2, we show that confinement effects and local cobalt atomic ordering in the interlayer space can be synergistically used to tune the adsorption energies of O, OH, and OOH reaction intermediates and the scaling relationship between them. In general, the interlayer confinement destabilizes the adsorption of intermediates for the OER, but clustering Co atoms can selectively stabilize the adsorption of OOH in particular. After considering both effects, our model predicts an overpotential of 0.30 V for the Co-intercalated MnO2 catalyzed OER, in excellent agreement with the experimental result of 0.36 V. These new insights explain the enhanced catalytic performance of MnO2 by intercalating atoms and illuminate a route for engineering non-toxic precious-metal-free catalysts through designed layered materials.

Surface regulation has achieved great success in enhancing catalytic performance, but it has been rarely demonstrated for the coupled hydrogen evolution reaction (HER)/EOR to date. Herein, the three-dimensional PtCu nanoframe (NF) with high-index facets and multi-channels is designed through a dealloying strategy to achieve bifunctional catalysis for HER and EOR The PtCu NF/C needs only 0.58 V to arrive at 10 mA cm(-2) in the coupled HER/EOR, while 1.88 V is required in water splitting. Moreover, ethanol can be oxidized by PtCu NF/C to acetate with a high Faradaic efficiency of 92%. Mechanistic studies reveal that the combination of the three-dimensional structure, Cu introduction, and high-index facets endows the PtCu NF/C with enhanced adsorption capacity for ethanol and H2O, is well as dissociation capacity for C-H bonds of ethanol.

A pure brownmillerite-type Ca2Fe2-xCoxO5 phase, which was categorized as an oxygen-deficiency-ordered perovskite-type structure, was synthesized in a range of x = 0-1.25. Brownmillerite-type Ca2FeCoO5 showed higher activity and durability for the OER in a neutral solution than perovskite-type LaFe0.5Co0.5O3 and SrFe0.5Co0.5O3-delta. Furthermore, the durability of Ca2Fe2-xCoxO5 was drastically improved by increasing the Co content from x = 1 to 1.25. Ca2Fe0.75Co1.25O5 was remarkably durable for about 70 h during the OER in a neutral solution whereas Ca2FeCoO5 lost activity within 20 h, and perovskite-type oxides lost activity within a few hours. The detailed analysis of structures and compositions of local regions of Ca2Fe2-xCoxO5 and their changes by the reaction based on electron microscopy clarified the important role of the brownmillerite structure itself in catalytic activity under neutral conditions, while, under alkaline conditions, it has been known that the amorphous phase derived from brownmillerite mainly played the role of active species.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			2398-4902			WOS:000790415300001

Further annealing at an elevated temperature under a nitrogen atmosphere yielded alloy nanorods textured nanoparticles. Numerous characterization techniques were used, revealing the bimetallic nature of the synthesised product. The product was a highly efficient and stable material for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in an alkaline medium. In 1.0 M KOH solution, the copper nickel alloy with graphitic carbon (Cu3.8Ni@C) catalyst showed remarkable OER activity, obtaining an overpotential of 233 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) with stability up to 18 h under continuous electrolysis. Consequently, we believe that this work could contribute insights into low-cost electrocatalysts for OER. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Among them, copper has attracted signi?cant attention due to its excellent electrocatalytic activity, low price, and abundance. Herein, a nanostructured copper oxide (CuO-A) is generated in situ from a cuprous selenide (Cu2Se) precursor under oxygen evolution reaction conditions. The as-prepared CuO-A/copper foam (CF) electrode delivers a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at an overpotential of 297 mV with good stability for over 50 h in 1 m KOH solution, which is superior to most recently reported copper-based water oxidation catalysts. The high catalytic performance of CuO-A is mainly attributed to the improved surface area offered by the morphology reconstruction during the in situ transformation process. As a result, it paves a way to synthesize effective and stable transition metal oxide catalysts via the in situ conversion of transition metal chalcogenides for energy conversion and storage applications.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			2194-4288	2194-4296		WOS:000535609400001

The model self-consistently accounts for the diffusion of all components, interfacial oxidation/reaction kinetics and the effect of stress on transport through the oxide layer. This model is employed to predict stress evolution in gadolinia doped ceria electrolyte-based fuel cells. Numerical solution of the model shows that the relative rates of interfacial reaction and oxygen diffusion in the oxide critically determine both the variation of stress across the thickness of the oxide film and its evolution. Calculated results, in agreement with experimental observations, show that doped ceria electrolyte-based fuel cells are safe to operate at temperatures less than 700degreesC. The dopant content in the electrolyte and the specific configuration of the fuel cell are also found to significantly influence stress evolution in the electrolyte layer.

Electrochemical water splitting is the most promising method to generate hydrogen, which is composed of two half-reactions: oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). However, conventional catalysts for OER are mainly based on precious metals, whose high cost interrupts the further practical applications in HER. In contrast, Co_3O_4-based oxides doped with transition metals have advantages of low cost, high catalytic activity and strong stability. But the researches of Co-based oxides mainly focus on the effect of doping transition metals (such as Zn, Ni and Fe) on catalytic performance, few of them explore the influence of electrochemically inactive materials. In this paper, a new CoFeNi oxide mixed with ZnO is synthetized. This CoFeNiZn oxide has a superior performance with small Tafel slope (40 mV/dec) and long-term stability. In 1 mol/L KOH electrolyte, the overpotential of the CoFeNiZn oxide is as low as 310 mV at the current density of 10 mA/cm~2, which is 90 mV lower than the overpotential of original CoFeNi oxide. The electrochemically inactive ZnO is the critical factor for this remarkable improvement, which can effectively disperse the active materials and fully expose the active sites of CoFeNi oxide. This discovery provides a strategy to design novel catalysts structures for improving electrochemical performance.			氢能因热值高、燃烧产物无污染等优良特性,成为目前新型能源研究的焦点,有望成为化石能源的理想替代品。电催化水分解作为最具前景的氢气制备方法,包含两个半反应:析氧反应(OER)和析氢反应(HER)。其中OER目前主要采用贵金属作为催化剂,但其高成本极大地限制了电催化产氢的工业化。基于Co_3O_4的Co基掺杂氧化物具有成本低廉、催化活性高且稳定性强等优良特性。目前对于Co基掺杂氧化物的研究主要集中于探究掺杂不同金属元素(Zn,Ni,Fe等)对其催化活性的影响,极少研究掺杂惰性氧化物对其催化活性的影响。合成了一种CoFeNiZn复合氧化物,且具有优良的电催化活性和稳定性。在1 mol/L KOH的电解液中,10 mA/cm~2的电流密度下,CoFeNiZn复合氧化物过电势(eta_(10))为310 mV,塔菲尔斜率(Tafel slope)为40 mV/dec,相比原始CoFeNi氧化物(eta_(10)为400 mV)过电势降低了90 mV。CoFeNiZn催化剂催化性能的提高主要是由于以惰性ZnO作为基质可有效地分散催化活性物质,并充分暴露CoFeNi氧化物的催化活性位点。这一基于催化材料掺杂非活性物质提高催化剂催化活性的发现可以为现有催化剂开发提供新的思路。						0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1674-3962			CSCD:6696721

For this reason, they are used widely in alkaline electrolysers. Several open questions remain as to the reason for their exceptionally high catalytic activity. Here we use a model system of mass-selected NiFe nanoparticles and isotope labelling experiments to show that oxygen evolution in 1M KOH does not proceed via lattice exchange. We complement our activity measurements with electrochemistry-mass spectrometry, taken under operando conditions, and transmission electron microscopy and low-energy ion-scattering spectroscopy, taken ex situ. Together with the trends in particle size, the isotope results indicate that oxygen evolution is limited to the near-surface region. Using the surface area of the particles, we determined that the turnover frequency was 6.2 +/- 1.6 s(-1) at an overpotential of 0.3 V, which is, to the best of our knowledge, the highest reported for oxygen evolution in alkaline solution.									221	3	0	0	22	0	221			2520-1158			WOS:000449799200009

Conventional electrolysers usually require stable power inputs in order to operate effectively and safely and so may be unsuited to harnessing renewable power, which is often intermittent and diffuse. Electrolysis mediated by Electron-Coupled-Proton Buffers has the potential to overcome some of the challenges surrounding electrolysis using low and/or sporadic power inputs (especially those related to gas crossover) as the use of Electron-Coupled-Proton Buffers allows the oxygen and hydrogen evolution reactions to be completely decoupled from one another. Herein, we show that silicotungstic acid can be used as an Electron-Coupled-Proton Buffer in a proton exchange membrane cell, decoupling the hydrogen and oxygen evolution reactions at steady state current densities as high as 500 mA cm(-2). O-2 and H-2 can be produced continuously by this system by cycling a fixed volume of the Electron-Coupled-Proton Buffer solution. Even at current densities as low as 25 mA cm(-2), the level of hydrogen in the oxygen stream is <0.4%, whereas a conventional proton exchange membrane electrolyser operating at this current density produces oxygen containing nearly 2% hydrogen (unacceptable for most applications). Furthermore, using silicotungstic acid as an Electron-Coupled-Proton Buffer also confers greater tolerance to non-deionised water inputs and reduces fluoride release from the perfluorosulfonated membrane (a marker for membrane degradation) relative to a conventional proton exchange membrane electrolyser. Together, these results highlight the promise and potential advantages of Electron-Coupled-Proton Buffers (and silicotungstic acid in particular) for the electrolytic production of hydrogen and oxygen over a wide range of current densities, such as might be delivered by renewable power inputs.

In order to enhance the energy conversion efficiency of these electrochemical devices, high performance and stable electrocatalysts are essential to accelerate the sluggish electrochemical kinetics, e.g. oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), oxygen evolution reaction (OER), hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and redox reaction. In recent years, as cost-effective and high-efficient catalysts, perovskite oxides have attracted much attention. In addition, the potential of perovskite electrocatalysts may be further boosted due to their flexible composition and tunable electronic structures. This review provides the readers with a comprehensive understanding and updated information of improvements towards the electrocatalytic performances of perovskite oxides. It will focus on research papers regarding low to intermediate temperature electrochemical devices, e.g., water splitting, fuel cells, chemical looping technology and three-way catalysis (TWC) published over the last five years. Various design strategies for optimizing the conductivity and catalytic activity of perovskite are discussed in detail. In the end, this review discusses challenges for the future researches in regard to perovskite based electrocatalysts.									22	0	0	0	4	0	21			1369-7021	1873-4103		WOS:000726983600003

The surface morphology, structural, and electrochemical properties of as-synthesized RuO2 materials were characterized by x-ray diffraction (XRD), field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM), Cyclic voltammetry (CV), N-2 adsorption-desorption isotherms and polarization curve for oxygen evolution reaction (OER). It was found that the morphology and crystalline structures and electrochemical properties of as-synthesized RuO2 materials were strongly dependent on the calcining temperature. The ruthenium-surfactant mesophase with mesoporous structure transformed from network to regular olivary or petal-like RuO2 materials and remaining partial mesoporous character after calcination at lower temperature (i.e., 300 and 400 degrees C). However, the mesophase transformed into RuO2 agglomeration consisted of nanosized particles after calcination at 650 degrees C, which may be attributed to complete deorganization and porous structure collapse of RuO2 materials. In addition, the as-synthesized RuO2 materials showed higher specific surface area and better electrochemical activities for oxygen evolution reaction compared with the RuO2 prepared without surfactant. The electrochemical activity of as-synthesized RuO2 material calcined at 400 degrees C is about 3 times than that of RuO2 prepared without surfactant for oxygen evolution reaction. This can be attributed to the porous structure and large surface area of as-synthesized RuO2 materials.									7	0	0	0	0	0	7			1480-2422			WOS:000326710600007

However, the 4-electron reaction and the slow transfer of holes render the oxidation reaction upon oxygen evolution photocatalyst to be the rate-determining step. Herein, we report on promoting the oxidation reaction in UiO-66-NH2@Au@CdS Z-scheme photocatalysts by using the aminated-functionalized linker bdc-NH2. Compared with pristine UiO-66 MOFs, UiO-66-NH2 not only extends the light harvesting range but also offers the high oxidation reaction performance matched with photocatalytic hydrogen generation. As a result, the highest H-2 generation rate obtained is 39.5 mu molh(-1), which is 2.18 times higher than that of the Z-scheme photocatalysts constructed by UiO-66. The present work clearly shows the essential importance in tuning the oxidation capacity of photosystem II in constructing Z-scheme photocatalysts for maximizing the water splitting.									7	1	0	0	1	0	7			0957-4522	1573-482X		WOS:000461168600091

This research outlines how kinetic parameters and the reaction behaviours of complex chemical processes resulting in fundamental technologies ranging from monometallic surfaces (Ni and Pt) to heterometallic surfaces (NiO, Fe/Ni, Pt/Ni) in an alkaline environment of approximately 30% KOH at 300 K-550 K can be extracted using reactive molecular dynamics (RMD) approach. The analytical overview of the detailed hydrogen evolution response of a multifaceted chemical system from reactants to products through different intermediates is provided, in order to maximize the performance of the reactive processes to deliver the desired products and eliminate unnecessary side products. Here, we concentrate on demonstrating that the kinetics information and reaction mechanisms required to explain the reactions analytically from such RMD are realistic. It is then possible to use this analytical definition to integrate the right reaction chemistry from the atomistic description of ReaxFF into larger-scale simulations using continuum chemical dynamics and/or computational fluid dynamics approaches. By systematically altering the composition of the surface, the integration of the second metal into the monometallic surfaces by aligning the ratio can dramatically increase the progressive alkaline electrolytic hydrogen evolution reaction (EHER) activity, and the best activity outperforms other advanced analogues in this study, is delivered from Fe/Ni heterometallic surface with a Fe/Ni ratio of 50%. The findings indicate that it is efficient to incorporate bimetallic component active sites for elementary steps to promote alkaline electrolytic hydrogen evolution reaction.									5	1	0	0	0	0	6			0254-0584	1879-3312		WOS:000682403200003

However, electrochemical CER is bridled with parallel oxygen evolution reaction (OER) reducing the performance of anodic CER In this context, guiding principles behind enhancing the selectivity of CER is investigated experimentally and computationally in RuO2 doped with earth-abundant first-row-transition-metals (i.e. Ti, Fe, Mn, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn). Computational studies suggest that doping of metals having higher d-electrons than Ru in RuO2 tend to lower the binding strength of OER intermediates thereby increasing its overpotential. However, doping has less effect on the binding strength of monovalent CER intermediates resulting in higher CER selectivity. Computational studies suggest that Cu (d9)-doped RuO2 would show maximum CER selectivity and this is corroborated by experiments in acidic medium with electrodeposited Cu-doped RuO2 where 95% selectivity was obtained at a dopant concentration of 2%.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			1938-5862			INSPEC:18520562

However, the cell voltage is limited by the anodic oxygen evolution reaction (OER), requiring a higher overpotential than cathodic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Herein, to boost water electrolysis, we replace the anodic OER with glucose oxidation reaction (GOR) over engineered ultra-thin cobalt nickel hydroxide nanosheet on carbon cloth, in which can synergistically improve its numbers of active sites, conductivity, intrinsic activity and stability with the Co doped alpha-Ni(OH)(2). When it couples with Pt cathode, the resulting cell voltage to drive water splitting at the current density of 100 mA cm(-2) with the assistance of glucose is as low as 1.56 V. While without the glucose in the electrolyte, the potential reaches as high as 1.75 V. Therefore, replacing OER with the GOR can reduce the potential of water electrolysis. This work is contributed to the development the other highly active and robust electrocatalysts in water electrolysis with the assistance of glucose or similar organic molecular.

Here, ultrathin NiCoFe layered double hydroxide (LDH) nanoplates, which directly grow on a cobalt-based nanowire array, forming a hierarchical nanoarray structure, are constructed as efficient oxygen evolution electrodes. In alkaline media, the ordered ultrathin hierarchical LDH nanoarray electrode shows dramatically increased catalytic activity compared to that of LDH nanoparticles and pure nanowire arrays due to the small size, large surface area, and high porosity of the NiCoFe LDH nanoarray. Only a small water oxidation overpotential (eta) of 257 mV is needed for a current density of 80 mA cm(-2) with a Tafel slope of 53 mV per decade. The hierarchical LDH nanoarray also shows excellent structural stability in alkaline media. After continuous testing under a high OER current density (similar to 300 mA cm(-2)) for 10 h, the sample maintains the ordered hierarchical structure with no significant deactivation of the catalytic properties.									154	19	0	0	2	0	162			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000343000800026	25162938

Herein, heterogeneous catalysts of NiTe@RuO2 and NiTe@NiFe-LDH are constructed by coupling ruthenium oxide (RuO2) and nickel-iron layered double hydroxide (NiFe-LDH) on T-shaped NiTe. The as-made NiTe@RuO2 and NiTe@NiFe-LDH catalysts exhibit outstanding hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity, respectively. Theoretical calculation and experimental measurement show that the electron transfer at the interface favors the H* adsorption during HER process. We construct full electrochemical cells for overall water splitting using NiTe@RuO2 as the cathode and NiTe@NiFe-LDH as the anode, which delivers a current density of 200 mA cm(-2) under a voltage of 1.63 V. When powdered by a solar cell with a voltage of 1.5 V, the full-cell worked well for continuous hydrogen/oxygen generation, showing its potential for sustainable green energy generation.									69	6	0	0	2	0	70			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000533148700060

Here we report a facile soft-template mediated approach for fabrication of nanostructured cobaltiron double sulfides that are covalently entrapped in nitrogen-doped mesoporous graphitic carbon (Co(0.5)Fe(0.)5S@N-MC). Notably, with a positive half-wave potential (0.808 V) and a high diffusion-limiting current density, the composite material delivers unprecedentedly striking ORR electrocatalytic activity among recently reported nonprecious late transition metal chalcogenide materials in alkaline medium. Various characterization techniques, including X-ray absorption spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and X-ray diffraction, are conducted to elucidate the correlation between structural features and catalytic activities of the composite. Moderate substitution and well-dispersion of iron in bimetallic sulfide composites are believed to have positive effect on the adsorption and activation of oxygen-containing species, thus leading to conspicuous ORR and OER catalytic enhancement compared to their monometallic counterparts. Besides, the covalent bridge between active sulfide particles and mesoporous carbon shells provides facile pathways for electron and mass transport. Beneficially, the intimate coupling interaction renders prolonged electrocatalytic performances to the composite. Our results may possibly lend a new impetus to the rational design of bi- or multimetallic sulfides encapsulated in porous carbon with improved performance for electrocatalysis and energy storage applications.									242	13	0	0	9	0	247			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000348332700021	25531776

Herein, we develop a space-confined strategy with a sacrificial template for preparing Fe7C3 nanoparticles embedded in an interconnected porous graphene-like Fe-/N-doped carbon matrix (Fe7C3@FeNC). This approach relies on pyrolysis of precursor hybrids of an iron-ellagic acid (Fe-EA) complex and polydopamine (PDA) from the pyrocondensation polymerization of dopamine (DA) that are confined in the interlayer gaps of the sacrifice template g-C3N4. Such a functionalized configuration can avoid the uncontrollable growth of polydopamine (PDA) during the usual solution polymerization and postsynthetic removal of the template. The as-prepared Fe7C3@FeNC catalyst shows an impressive half-wave potential of 0.83 V for ORR and a low overpotential of 358 mV for reaching the current density of 10 mA cm(-2) for OER in alkaline solution. Moreover, when used as an air cathode for the Zn-air battery, the Fe7C3@FeNC-based device also exhibits remarkable performance with a narrow charge-discharge voltage gap and high cycling stability. The space-confined strategy is unique, and the bifunctionality of Fe7C3@FeNC with hierarchical structures is appealing and may be of value for practical applications in energy conversion and storage systems.									31	0	0	0	1	0	31			2168-0485			WOS:000480370500102

Whereas structure activity relationships are rapidly evolving, the corresponding structure stability relationships are still missing. This is primarily because there is no adequate experimental approach capable of monitoring the stability of well-defined single crystals in situ. Here, by utilizing the power of inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) connected to a stationary probe and coupling this technique to the rotating disk electrode method, it was possible to simultaneously measure the dissolution rates of surface atoms (as low as 0.4 pg cm(-2) s(-1)) and correlate them with the kinetic rates of electrochemical reactions in real time. Making use of this unique probe, it was possible to establish almost "atom by atom" structure-stability-activity relationships for platinum single crystals in both acidic and alkaline environments. We found that the degree of stability is strongly dependent on the coordination of surface atoms (less coordinated yields less stable), the nature of covalent and noncovalent interactions (i.e., adsorption of hydroxyl groups, oxygen atoms, and halide species vs interactions between hydrated Li cations and surface oxide), the thermodynamic driving force for Pt complexation (Pt ion speciation in solution), and the nature of the electrochemical reaction (the oxygen reduction/evolution and CO oxidation reactions). These findings open new opportunities for elucidating key fundamental descriptors that govern both activity and stability trends and will ultimately assist in the development of real energy conversion and storage systems.									141	5	0	0	9	0	143			2155-5435			WOS:000373524400048

Here, we report a concept whereby graphene defects trap atomic Ni species (aNi) inside to form an integrity (aNi@defect). X-ray adsorption characterization and density-functional-theory calculation revealed that the diverse defects in graphene can induce different local electronic densities of state (DOSs) of aNi, which suggests that aNi@defect serves as an active site for unique electrocatalytic reactions. As examples, aNi@G585 is responsible for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), and aNi@G5775 activates the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). The derived catalyst exhibits exceptionally good activity for both HER and OER, e.g., an overpotential of 70 mV at 10 mA/cm(2) for HER (analogous to the commercial Pt/C) and 270 mV at 10 mA/cm(2) for OER (much superior to that of Ir oxide).									450	34	1	0	25	0	455			2451-9294			WOS:000429434000009

However, the high overpotential limits the conversion efficiency, even when precious metal catalysts are used to drive it. Plasmonic metal-semiconductor systems can potentially overcome this problem, because hot electrons generated by localized surface plasmon resonance are rapidly injected into the semiconductor, and concentrated hot holes oxidize water on the catalysts for oxygen evolution. Using Ni-modified Au/TiO2, we investigated distinct Raman spectral characteristics of water-oxidation intermediates at electrochemical potentials near the flat-band potential of TiO2. Specifically, in situ electrochemical surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy was performed over the pH range 7-13. Significantly enhanced photocurrents at near-neutral conditions were generated with low-energy photons (1.58 eV), providing the first robust experimental evidence that nickel-based catalysts accelerated the four-electron multistep reaction via plasmon-assisted water oxidation.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			2380-8195			WOS:000731062000026

Multimetallic nanoframe structures have received great attention as promising electrocatalysts for these reactions, because their inherent high surface area and tunable surface energy states are beneficial to the electrocatalyst performance. We envisaged that the stability and activity of multimetallic nanoframe catalysts could be simultaneously augmented by introducing an additional structural feature of activity-enhancing lattice mismatch via formation of a structure-fortifying core-shell structure. Herein, we successfully demonstrate that hemi-core@frame AuCu@IrNi nanocrystals, possessing structural features of both nanoframe and core-shell, are active and durable bifunctional catalysts toward both the OER and HER under acidic conditions. The hemicore@frame AuCu@IrNi nanocrystals exhibit superior efficient electrocatalytic performance toward the overall water splitting reaction, and show 355 mV overpotential at the current density of 10 mA cm(-2) in a 0.5 M H2SO4 electrolyte. The robustness of the catalysts was also verified through the long-term stability test.									32	2	0	0	1	0	32			2055-6756	2055-6764		WOS:000471816500018

The maximal enhancement is achieved, within the thermodynamic argument, by aligning the adsorption free energies of reaction intermediates so that energy barriers along the reaction path are minimized. Full alignment is, however, difficult to realize. This is due to the linear scaling relation between the adsorption energies of intermediates along the reaction path, which has been observed almost universally in electrocatalyst materials including Pt. Thus, finding a way to deviate from this universal relation is an important issue in the catalyst design. Here, we investigate such possibility by studying TiO2 surfaces modified with substitutional dopants or oxygen vacancies. Our density functional calculations suggest that universal scaling is violated on TiO2, particularly when the adsorbent forms bonds not only with a metal atom but also with a lattice oxygen atom. This fact suggests that TiO2 has the potential to surpass conventional catalysts such as Pt in terms of oxygen reduction reaction activity.									10	1	0	0	0	0	10			1932-7447	1932-7455		WOS:000481568900027

Herein, a tandem catalysis strategy based on a single-atom catalyst with Cr atoms atomically dispersed at a CoSe2 support (Cr-1/CoSe2) is presented. Thereinto, Co and Cr sites are endowed with a specific function to activate water and styrene respectively, and the competition between the OER and styrene oxidation is turned into mutual benefits via cooperated active sites. Under a potential of 1.6 V-Ag/AgCl, excellent selectivity of 95% to benzaldehyde and a high conversion rate of styrene at 88% without any exogenous oxidizing reagent are achieved. Isotopic tracing, isotope-labeled in situ Raman spectra, and detailed theoretical calculation further reveal the tandem mechanism, showing that the transfer of *OOH intermediates from the Co to the Cr sites serves as a bridge to link the oxidation of water and styrene. This work develops a new strategy for the co-oxidation of multi-species based on tandem catalysis, providing novel insights for the design of single-atom catalysts.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0935-9648	1521-4095		WOS:000800653000001	35460128

A trifunctional electrocatalyst for water splitting (hydrogen evolution, oxygen reduction and oxygen evolution reaction, HER/ORR/OER) was designed via eco-friendly and facial way. CoFe2O4 nanoparticles embedded in nitrogen doped mesoporous carbon were prepared using chicken egg white/albumin after pyrolysis at different temperatures, 700, 800, 900 and 1000 degrees C. The specific surface area, pore size and the interaction between CoFe2O4 nanoparticles and carbon matrix were tuned via pyrolysis temperature. The catalyst prepared at 900 degrees C, (N/CF-EC-900) exhibit superior catalytic activity as well as the superior stability than that other nanocomposites prepared and other commercial catalyst (Pt/C, RuPO2) for water splitting. Our findings emphasize the importance of CoFe2O4 nanoparticles embedded in the carbon and suggest the catalytic activities with low onset potential, high current densities, small Tafel slope in basic medium.

This transient OCV overshoot behavior was due to the hydrogen evolution and subsequent oxidation reactions at the anode catalyst layer. Furthermore, within the OCV overshoot period the DMFC anode behaved like a hydrogen electrode due to the existence of hydrogen at the catalyst layer, resulting in a transient reference hydrogen electrode, which allows quantifying the respective anode and cathode potentials of the DMFC.

In this study, a Ni3S2-MoS2 nanoheterojunction catalyst with strong electronic interactions is prepared. It exhibits high efficiency for both the HER and the electrooxidation of 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF). In a two-electrode cell with Ni3S2-MoS2 serving as both the anode and cathode, the potential is only 1.44 V at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2), which is much lower than that of pure water splitting. Density functional theory calculations confirm that the strong chemisorption of H and HMF at the interface leads to outstanding electrocatalytic activity. The findings not only provide a strategy for developing efficient electrocatalysts, but also provide an approach for the continuous production of high value-added products and H-2.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1613-6810	1613-6829		WOS:000795780200001	35570703

Herein, a unique type of NiFe-based oxide catalyst with abundant defects is successfully synthesized via pulsed laser ablation in a specific atmosphere containing reductive NH3. The catalyst is self-supported and assembled from ultrafine nanoparticles with size of less than 5 nm. X-ray diffraction, transmission electron microscopy, and x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analyses suggest that the reductive NH3 results in a large number of oxygen and nickel vacancies and lower crystallinity. Consequently, the catalyst exhibits a high-performance OER activity with a low overpotential of 223 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) and a small Tafel slope of 35.0 mV dec(-1), surpassing most NiFe-based OER electrocatalysts.									3	1	0	0	0	0	4			1042-346X	1938-1387		WOS:000531740200006

Herein, using comprehensive first-principles computations, the potential of a variety of single metal based catalysts supported by MoSe2 nanosheet to boost the ORR or OER process was evaluated. The computations revealed that these considered metal atoms can be more stably anchored on 1 T-MoSe2 than those of on 2H-MoSe2. In particular, the supported Ni and Pd catalysts on 1 T-MoSe2 exhibit high OER activity due to their quite low overpotential (0.47 and 0.49 V). Meanwhile, the anchored Pd atom on 1 T-MoSe2 also displays excellent ORR performance with an ultra-low overpotential of 0.32 V, thus implying its superior bifunctional activity for ORR/OER. Our results provide a quite promising avenue to design a new class of MoSe2-based single atom catalysts for fuel cells, which also further enriches the application fields of MoSe2 nanosheets in advanced catalysis.

In this work, dense NiMoO4 micropillars arrays (MPAs) were in-situ grown on nickel foam (NF) through facile hydrothermal method, then the NiMoO4/NF were converted into NiMoO4-P/NF and NiFe/NiMoO4/NF via phosphating and electrodeposition method, respectively. The NiMoO4-P/NF electrode required small overpotentials of 34 mV@10 mA cm(-2) and 130 mV@100 mA cm(-2) for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). The NiFe/NiMoO4/NF electrode exhibited excellent oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity with overpotentials of 210 mV@10 mA cm(-2) and 300 mV@100 mA cm(-2). The overall water splitting using the anode-cathode couple of NiFe/NiMoO4/NF parallel to NiMoO4-P/NF only consumes low voltages of 1.47 V@10 mA cm(-2) for 100 h and 1.66 V@100 mA cm(-2) for 50 h in 1 M KOH. The electronic modification and the well-designed hierarchical structure contribute the high energy-efficient and stabile overall water splitting. (C) 2019 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC.

In this work, a hybrid of CoFe2O4 nanoparticles supported on nitrogen/sulfur dual-doped three-dimensional (3D) reduced graphene oxide networks (CFO/NS-rGO) has been designed and fabricated. The doping of N and S provide the graphene networks with a large amount of defects. Moreover, both N and S doped in reduced graphene oxide play important roles in engineering the covalent coupling between CoFe2O4 and the 3D graphene networks. The covalent coupling between CoFe2O4 and NS-rGO along with the hierarchical porous structure and 3D networks endow the hybrid with a pronounced ORR activity (4-electron pathway), superior OER activity (comparable to that of the state-of-the-art RuO2/C catalyst) and high durability toward both ORR and OER.

Modelling the impedance responses by using equivalent circuits inhibits the investigation of kinetic parameters of the basic electrochemical reactions, which take place at single electrode-electrolyte inter-faces. Therefore, we evaluate single electrode impedance measurements by a kinetic model, which is based on specific reaction pathways, either for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) or the hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR). As a consequence, it is possible to obtain kinetic parameters for the specific reaction of interest. Furthermore, the information gained from the single electrode impedance measurements and the kinetic model can give insight into single reactions steps. In particular, the ORR has to include a chemical step in the reaction pathway. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

However, both OER and ORR still suffer from sluggish kinetics, even when using the mainstream precious metal-based catalysts. Herein, oxygen vacancies-rich CeO2 decorated CoSe2 nanocubes are proposed as a novel air electrode to drive OER and ORR for ZABs. The resultant CeO2 coupled CoSe2 nanocubes (CeO2@CoSe2-NCs) catalyst exhibits a significantly enhanced bifunctional activity relative to the pristine CoSe2-NCs and the pristine CeO2. Moreover, an assembled ZABs using this CeO2@CoSe2-NCs electrode delivers a high output power density of 153 mW cm(-2) and a long-life stability over 400 cycles, superior to the benchmark Pt/C-IrO2 electrode. Theoretical calculations reveal that the electronic interaction and oxygen vacancies in CeO2@CoSe2-NCs contribute to efficient oxygen electrocatalysis. This protocol provides a promising approach of constructing oxygen vacancies in hybrid catalysts for energy conversion and storage devices. (C) 2022 Elsevier Inc.

In this work, through a simple hydrothermal method and following annealing process, Mo2C and Ni nanoparticles were encapsulated in a nanoporous hierarchical structure of carbon (Ni/Mo2C/C). The ingenious structure delivers several favorable characteristics including abundant active sites resulting from hollow and mesoporous architecture, boosted reaction kinetics from metallic components, sufficient interfacial effect and synergistic effect from intimate integration of Mo2C, Ni and C. The multifunctional Ni/Mo2C/C hybrid electrocatalyst performs excellently for ORR, OER and HER, better than most of the reported electrocatalysts with three functions.

During hydrogen evolution reaction, ingress of H severely affects the physical and mechanical properties of the material causing catastrophic brittle failures (hydrogen embrittlement). In this work, by chronoamperometry technique, an electrode with CoSe catalyst system is intentionally diffused with H to serve as a hydrogen stressed CoSe electrode. Surprisingly this H-embrittled CoSe electrode exhibits enhanced oxygen evolution reaction (OER) behavior as confirmed by linear sweep voltammetry (LSV), impedance, and Tafel analysis, a cathodic shift of 80 mV at the current density of 10 mA cm(-2), impedance analysis reveals half the time of R-ct decreasing in the OER on H-embrittled CoSe than pristine CoSe. The Tafel slope of the H-embrittled CoSe exhibits of 30 mV, which is relatively lower than the pristine CoSe at OER condition. These results collectively support the enhanced activity of the H-embrittled CoSe electrode towards OER. Diffusion of hydrogen into metal lattice is confirmed by the high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM) fringes analysis, where a 22% decrease Q2 in the lattice distance is revealed by the H-embrittled CoSe catalyst.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			2196-7350			WOS:000721465000001

In this study, self-supported carbon nanofiber (CNF) electrodes decorated with nickel/nickel oxide (Ni/NiO) and palladium (Pd) nanoparticles (NPs) were prepared by combining electrospinning, peroxidation, and thermal carbonation with atomic layer deposition (ALD), and then employed for hydrogen evolution and oxygen evolution reactions (HER/OER). The best CNF-Ni/NiO-Pd electrode displayed the lowest overpotential (63 mV and 1.6 V at j = 10 mA cm(-2)), a remarkably small Tafel slope (72 and 272 mV dec(-1)), and consequent exchange current density (1.15 and 22.4 mA cm(-2)) during HER and OER, respectively. The high chemical stability and improved electrocatalytic performance of the prepared electrodes can be explained by CNF functionalization via Ni/NiO NP encapsulation, the formation of graphitic layers that cover and protect the Ni/NiO NPs from corrosion, and ALD of Pd NPs at the surface of the self-supported CNF-Ni/NiO electrodes.

Herein, we prepare metal-organic framework based, cobalt sulfide nanoleaves followed by hydrothermal growth of hierarchical MoS2-Ni3S2 nanorods on a three-dimensional nickel foam substrate. The heterostructure of Co3S4@ MoS2-Ni3S2 catalyst electrode was served directly as an electrocatalyst for overall water splitting reactions such as oxygen evolution (OER) reactions and hydrogen evolution reactions (HER). The as-prepared Co3S4@ MoS2-Ni3S2 nanorods display outstanding electrocatalytic performance towards OER and HER with overpotential (eta) of 270 mV and 136 mV at a current density of 50 mA cm(-2) for OER, 10 mA cm(-2) for HER in 1 M KOH solutions respectively. These results mainly originate the unique architecture of Co3S4@MoS2-Ni3S2 heterostructure, which leads to enhance electrical conductivity, exposing a number of active sites and assisting the transport of ion to the electrode and electrolyte interface. This work suggests that the rational design of hybrid architecture have possible to develop for high-performance energy conversion applications. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Here, we report a strategy using Fe substitution to enable the inactive spinel CoAl2O4 to become highly active and superior to the benchmark IrO2. The Fe substitution is revealed to facilitate surface reconstruction into active Co oxyhydroxides under OER conditions. It also activates deprotonation on the reconstructed oxyhydroxide to induce negatively charged oxygen as an active site, thus significantly enhancing the OER activity of CoAl2O4. Furthermore, it promotes the pre-oxidation of Co and introduces great structural flexibility due to the uplift of the oxygen 2p levels. This results in the accumulation of surface oxygen vacancies along with lattice oxygen oxidation that terminates as Al3+ leaches, preventing further reconstruction. We showcase a promising way to achieve tunable electrochemical reconstruction by optimizing the electronic structure for low-cost and robust spinel oxide OER catalysts.									380	27	0	0	34	0	388			2520-1158			WOS:000486144700008

Carbon catalysts have many advantages over others due to their low cost, excellent electrical conductivity, high surface area, and easy functionalization. However, they typically cannot withstand the highly oxidative OER environment. Here, a new class of bifunctional electrocatalyst is reported, consisting of ultralarge sized nitrogen doped graphene tubes (N-GTs) (>500 nm) decorated with FeCoNi alloy particles. These tubes are prepared from an inexpensive precursor, dicyandiamide, via a template-free graphitization process. The ORR/OER activity and the stability of these graphene tube catalysts depend strongly on the transition metal precursors. The best performing FeCoNi-derived N-GT catalyst exhibits excellent ORR and OER activity along with adequate electrochemical durability over a wide potential window (0-1.9 V) in alkaline media. The measured OER current is solely due to desirable O-2 evolution, rather than carbon oxidation. Extensive electrochemical and physical characterization indicated that high graphitization degree, thicker tube walls, proper nitrogen doping, and presence of FeCoNi alloy particles are vital for high bifunctional activity and electrochemical durability of tubular carbon catalysts.									191	9	0	0	3	0	192			1614-6832	1614-6840		WOS:000388993100012

Moreover, a high conductivity of electrocatalysts ensures a fast electron transfer and thus plays a significant role in OER. Therefore, the development of efficient electrocatalysts with synergistically engineered structure and conductivity is urgently needed. Here, we present an ingenious design of manganese-modulated cobalt selenide nanosheets with systematically engineered structure and conductivity for efficient OER. Tailored atomic disorder, tuned electronic structure, and optimized electrical conductivity could be simultaneously realized by Mn modulation, leading to effective generation of active sites and promoted OER rate. The resultant (CoMn)Se-2 catalysts exhibited remarkable electrocatalytic OER performance with a 5.8-fold and 10.8-fold higher activity relative to CoSe2 and state-of-the-art IrO2. This work provides a comprehensive understanding on origin of high activity of transition metal non-oxide electrocatalysts and enables the rational design of highly efficient electrocatalysts with precisely engineered structural and electrical properties.									84	4	0	0	4	0	84			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000437965900056

The electrodes employ high surface area conductive carbon as the reaction host, and polytetrafluoroethylene as the binding agent to enhance the oxygen reduction reaction ( ORR)/oxygen evolution reaction ( OER) reversibility. Roll-pressed, self-standing electrodes ( SSEs) and thinner, spray deposited electrodes ( SDEs) are characterized in lithium-oxygen cells using an ionic liquid ( IL) based electrolyte formed by mixing lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl) imide ( LiTFSI) salt and N,N-diethyl-N-(2-methoxyethyl)-N-methylammonium bis( trifluoromethanesulfonyl) imide ( DEMETFSI). The electrochemical results reveal reversible reactions for both electrode configurations, but improved electrochemical performance for the self-standing electrodes in lithium-oxygen cells. These electrodes show charge/discharge polarizations at 60 degrees C limited to 0.4 V, with capacity up to 1 mAhcm(-2) and energy efficiency of about 88%, while the spray deposited electrodes reveal, under the same conditions, a polarization of 0.6 V and energy efficiency of 80 %. The roll pressed electrode combined with the DEMETFSI-LiTFSI electrolyte and a composite LixSn-C alloy anode forms a full Li-ion oxygen cell showing extremely limited polarization, and remarkable energy efficiency.									7	0	0	0	0	0	7			0947-6539	1521-3765		WOS:000426495100018	29244897

However, the sluggish kinetics of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) hinder its larger-scale application. NiFe-based catalysts are some of the most efficient oxygen evolution catalysts (OECs). High-valence Ni is considered as an active site or conductive framework in NiFe-based OECs. However, the oxidation of Ni is usually hindered in the presence of Fe. This paper describes an effective strategy to produce NiFe (oxy)hydroxide with easily oxidized Ni and a hierarchical nanosheet structure as the most efficient OEC. High valence Ni may provide frameworks with good conductivity and facilitate OERs in Fe active sites. In addition, the hierarchical structure can increase the electrochemical surface area, resulting in more active sites for the OER. The as-prepared Fe-O-Ni(OH)(2) supported on nickel foam needs overpotentials of 185, 220 and 261 mV to drive current densities of 10, 100 and 500 mA cm(-2), respectively. The catalyst also shows excellent stability at the current densities of 100 and 500 mA cm(-2) for 50 hours.									46	3	0	0	0	0	48			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000445218000005

The product exhibited greatly enhanced photocatalytic activities for water oxidation under visible-light irradiation. Further characterizations and spectroscopic analyses revealed that the grafted Co(4)(III)O(4)cubane units could effectively capture the photogenerated holes from excited PCN, lower the overpotential of oxygen evolution reaction (OER), and serve as efficient catalysts to promote the multi-electron water oxidation process.

In the present work, we synthesized NiFeV-LDH with abundant highly active sites for the OER. The evolution of the microstructure, composition, and electrocatalytic activity of NiFeV-LDH was studied by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray absorption fine structure (XAFS), and electrochemical characterization methods. Results showed that electrochemical activation promotes the release of vanadium and reconstruction of the surface composition. Due to the synergistic effect of iron and vanadium, the derived NiFeV-LDH exhibited excellent OER activity and good stability. This work suggests that the surface reconstruction is an efficient strategy to improve the OER activity.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			2398-4902			WOS:000660091200001

Pyrolysis of the Co-MOF-1 under Ar atmosphere (at 800 degrees C) yielded a Co nanoparticle-embedded N-doped carbon nanotube matrix (Co/NCNT-Ar) while pyrolysis under a reductive H-2/Ar atmosphere (at 800 degrees C) and further mild calcination yielded Co3O4@Co core-shell nanoparticle-encapsulated N-doped carbon nanotubes (Co3O4@Co/NCNT). Both catalysts show bi-functional activity towards ORR and OER, however, the core-shell Co3O4@Co/NCNT nanostructure exhibited superior electrocatalytic activity for both the ORR with a potential of 0.88V at a current density of -1mAcm(-2) and the OER with a potential of 1.61V at 10mAcm(-2), which is competitive with the most active bi-functional catalysts reported previously.									60	2	0	0	4	0	62			0947-6539	1521-3765		WOS:000418356700029	28914980

Here, a facile room-temperature strategy has been developed to synthesize an iron-nickel amorphous ICP (Ni2Fe-ICP) nanosheet array on Ni foam as a self-supported electrode. Ni2Fe-ICP exhibits excellent electrocatalytic performance in the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Specifically, Ni2Fe-ICP shows a low overpotential of 275 mV at a current density of 100 mA cm(-2), outperforming commercial RuO2, and has superior stability at a high current density (150 mA cm(-2) can be retained for at least 30 h). Furthermore, the real OER active species are revealed to be metal oxides that evolve during the OER process. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V.

In this work, nitrogen-doped hollow carbon spheres with nanoporous shells (NHCS-W) are prepared by using the ionic liquid 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium chloride as a source of both carbon and nitrogen. A systematic investigation of the electrocatalytic performance and durability of NHCS-W reveals excellent performance and high stabilities for the oxygen reduction reaction, oxygen evolution reaction, and hydrogen evolution reaction in alkaline electrolytes. This multifunctionality facilitates promising practical applicability for NHCS-W. An alkaline exchange membrane fuel cell (AEMFC) with NHCS-W as the cathode electrocatalyst has a peak power density of 109 mW cm(-2), which is 7 mW cm(-2) higher than that of an AEMFC with Pt/C (20%) as the cathode electrocatalyst. By using NHCS-W as an air electrode, two rechargeable Zn-air batteries in series can power a 5 mm red light-emitting diode (similar to 2.2 V). Moreover, a cell voltage of only 1.61 V is needed to achieve a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) in a water-splitting electrolyzer employing NHCS-W as both the cathode and anode catalysts. This work reveals the potential of ionic liquid precursors for constructing nitrogen-doped carbon-based materials for a wide variety of electrocatalytic applications.									32	3	0	0	3	0	32			0378-7753	1873-2755		WOS:000494885800025

This paper also reveals the disaster mechanism of development and evolution of coalfield fire area as a series of activities: Heat releasing originated from coal oxygen complex chemical reactions and overlying strata collapse made by burn out area, followed by the fracture network formed by cracks in coal and rock mass, which provide circulation channel for oxygen and combustion products, ultimately the expansion of the fire disaster mechanism extending to the deep. Thus, the coupling of the coal fire thermal hydrological mechanical and chemical field is an accelerating nonlinear dynamic cycle process of coal combustion. The results provide a scientific basis for the prevention and control of coalfield fire.									5	1	0	0	0	0	5			1000-7857			INSPEC:16081016

RuO2 is one of the most active anode oxides for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). However, RuO2 is very expensive and unstable under alkaline water electrolysis conditions. Here, we report a CeO2 supported RuO2 as a highly efficient electrocatalyst for the OER in alkaline media. We fabricated nano-sized CeO2 particles by an "explosion" reaction using Ag@CeO2 core-shell nanospheres as the precursor. High resolution transmission electron microscopy and Raman spectroscopy reveal that the obtained CeO2 particles possess a large number of oxygen defects. We decorated the defective CeO2 with nano-sized RuO2 (3-5 nm) through wet impregnation. The OER activity of RuO2 is improved by similar to 150% on the defective CeO2 as compared to the pristine RuO2 electrocatalyst. Moreover, the RuO2 supported on defective CeO2 shows better stability in 0.1 M KOH electrolyte. The improved activity and stability likely originate from the highly oxidative oxygen species O-2(2-)/O- formed in the defective CeO2, which can easily migrate from CeO2 and "spillover" to the surface of RuO2 during the OER process.									175	7	0	0	9	0	180			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000346082100024

Aid of cobalt ions in boosting the electrocatalytic oxygen and hydrogen evolution functions of NdFeO3 perovskite nanostructures								JOURNAL OF MATERIALS RESEARCH AND TECHNOLOGY-JMR&T				11				2246	2254		10.1016/j.jmrt.2021.02.047		MAR 2021		MAR-APR 2021	2021	Inorganic perovskite nanostructures based on neodymium (Nd) were processed in form of nanostructures for bi-functional electrocatalytic reactions. The active role of Co ions in influencing the material characteristics of Nd-ferrite (NdFeO3) were investigated in detail. The nanostructural characteristics were adjudged through the aid of diffraction and high resolution microscopic studies. Evidences relating to the co-occurrence of neodymium oxides (Nd2O3) were also noticed. The valency of Nd, Co and Fe ions and their nature of interaction in the ferrite architecture was studied through X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. Here, convincing affirmations relating to the partial substitution of Co ions in place of Nd and Fe sites were also made. NdFeO3 and NdxCo(1-x)FeO(3) nanostructures were studied for their electrocatalytic functions under varied alkaline pH (10 and 14) conditions. The improved conductivity studied via electrochemical impedance analysis in Co incorporated ferrites were noted to accelerate oxygen/hydrogen production in the corresponding electrodes. The overpotential values corresponding to oxygen evolution reactions reduced to 198 mV from 227 mV, while hydrogen evolution reactions lowered to 206 mV from 239 mV upon Co substitution. Similarly, the related Tafel slope values got improved in Co substituted ferrite matrix. The overall stability related electrochemical data suggested the processed ferrites as viable bi-functional electrocatalysts possessing essential features required for effective oxygen and hydrogen evolution reactions.(C) 2021 The Author(s).

J	Lu, Ding; Xu, Chunjian; Wang, Yan; Cai, Wangfeng								Mechanistic study on pH-related behavior in rocking-chair capacitive deionization								DESALINATION				510						115090	10.1016/j.desal.2021.115090		APR 2021		AUG 15 2021	2021	Rocking-chair capacitive deionization (RCDI) is a semi-continuous desalination technology, however, suffering from issues pertaining to effluent salinity and pH. We thoroughly investigated the composition evolution and pHrelated behavior in RCDI and disclosed the underlying causes for quality decay. RCDI concomitantly produces two streams: the desalted cathodic effluent becomes basic, whereas the brine anodic stream becomes acidic. These pH-related species deteriorate the outflow quality and distort conductivity profiles. Under variation in dissolved oxygen and potential distribution, we verified the carbon oxidation and oxygen evolution reactions as causes for the acidic anode and oxygen reduction as the cause for the basic cathode. Faradaic reactions and resultant pH fluctuation were exacerbated with increasing charging voltages, even at 0.9 V, whereas they were negligibly affected by the resembling potential distribution at different flowrates. To improve pH stability and water recovery, we integrated the ion exchange and flowrate adjustment procedures; consequently, water recovery increased to 71.43% and pH was stabilized at 5-6.5 for over 80 cycles, with significant adsorption capacity enhancement owing to the ion exchange with pH-related species. Thus, with a better understanding of pHrelated behaviors, RCDI can be optimized and extended more specifically for demands such as acid/base production and resource enrichment.									1	0	0	0	1	0	1			0011-9164	1873-4464		WOS:000648628300004

Ionically dispersed platinum in Ce1 -aEuro parts per thousand x Pt (x) O2 -aEuro parts per thousand delta and Ce1 -aEuro parts per thousand x -aEuro parts per thousand y Ti (y) Pt (x) O2 -aEuro parts per thousand delta is active toward these reactions compared with CeO2 alone. Higher electrocatalytic activity of Pt2+ ions in CeO2 and Ce1 -aEuro parts per thousand x Ti (x) O-2 compared with the same amount of Pt-0 in Pt/C is attributed to Pt2+ ion interaction with CeO2 and Ce1 -aEuro parts per thousand x Ti (x) O-2 to activate the lattice oxygen of the support oxide. Utilization of this activated lattice oxygen has been demonstrated in terms of high oxygen evolution in acid medium with these catalysts. Further, ionic platinum in CeO2 and Ce1 -aEuro parts per thousand x Ti (x) O-2 does not suffer from CO poisoning effect unlike Pt-0 in Pt/C due to participation of activated lattice oxygen which oxidizes the intermediate CO to CO2. Hence, higher activity is observed toward formic acid and methanol oxidation compared with same amount of Pt metal in Pt/C.									21	0	0	0	0	0	21			1432-8488	1433-0768		WOS:000295867100015

In light of this, biomass activated carbon-decorated tungsten oxide (WO3/B-AC) nanocomposites are synthesized through a simple sonochemical method. The WO3/B-AC nanocomposites show an aggregated structure of activated carbon nanosheet-encapsulated tungsten oxide nanoflakes. The WO3/B-AC nanocomposites exhibit the overpotential of 320 mV at 10 mA/cm(2) with the Tafel slope of similar to 48 mV/dec and good stability for the oxygen evolution reaction. For the hydrogen evolution reaction, the nanocomposites also show the overpotential of 360 mV at 10 mA/cm(2) with the Tafel slope of similar to 14 mV/dec and excellent durability in 1 M KOH. The superior electrocatalytic activity of the WO3/B-AC nanocomposite electrode is attributed to the synergetic effect from both the high electrical conductivity of activated carbon nanosheets and the high electrochemically-active surface area of WO3 nanoflakes. These results advocate that the sonochemically synthesized WO3/B-AC nanocomposites hold promise as excellent electrocatalysts for green energy conversion and storage applications.

Recently, layered double hydroxides (LDHs), especially NiFe-LDH, have been regarded as highly performed electrocatalysts for OER in alkaline condition. Here we first present a new class of NiLa-LDH electrocatalyst synthesized by an electrochemical process for efficient water splitting. The as-prepared NiLa-LDH nanosheet arrays (NSAs) give remarkable electrochemical activity and durability under alkaline environments, with a low overpotential of 209 mV for OER to deliver a current density of 10 mA cm(-2), surpassing most of previous reported LDHs eletrocatalysts. The presence of NiLa-LDH in this work extends the studies about LDHs-based electrocatalysts, which will benefit the development of electrochemical energy storage and conversion systems.

Herein, a new hybrid catalyst i.e. het-erometallic FeCo oxyhydroxides (FexCo1-xOOH) decorated on borate-treated BiVO4 photoanode (B-BiVO4), is prepared via a simple immersion procedure. The obtained photoanode serves as a water oxidation catalyst capable of accelerating the transportation of the photo-generated holes from the B-BiVO4 photoanode to the surface active sites of FexCo1-xOOH nanoparticles, while the Fe and Co species in the FexCo1-xOOH serve as hole shuttling mediators beneficial to the oxygen evolution reaction. Particuarly, introducing Co into BiVO4 lattice boosts the photostability by inhibiting the photooxidation-coupled dissolution of V5+ from BiVO4 lattice. The B-BiVO4/FexCo1-xOOH photoanode displays an extremely excellent photocurrent density of 5.21 mA cm-2 at 1.23 VRHE, with a 60% increase over the B-BiVO4 (3.26 mA cm(-2)). Particularly, the photocurrent density of the B-BiVO4/FexCo1-xOOH & nbsp;photoanode during consecutive illumination for 10 h shows a negligible decay, corre-sponding to more 95% of the initial photocurrent density. The improved PEC performance is attributed to the accelerated charge separation/transfer and surface water oxidation reaction occurring in the photoanode matrix and/or at the photoanode/electrolyte interface due to the synergistic effect of bifunctional (FexCo1-xOOH )and B-BiVO4.									5	0	0	0	2	0	5			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000777587900007

However, a comprehensive study is yet to be done to reveal the surface structure-performance relationship of NiFe alloys. In particular, the role of the ultrathin surface oxide layer, which is unavoidable for pure NiFe alloys, is always neglected. Herein, a series of NiFe alloys with different Ni/Fe ratios are fabricated. It is found that different Ni/Fe ratios lead to significant differences in surface composition and structure of the NiFe alloys, and thus affect their catalytic performance. Then, the oxide/metal interface of the Ni4Fe1 alloy is tailored by adjusting the hydrogenation temperature to further understand the surface structure-activity relationship, and the optimal OER performance is achieved at the oxide/metal interfaces that have suitable surface Fe/Ni ratio and an appropriate amount of oxygen vacancies. In-situ Raman characterization shows that the Ni4Fe1 alloy with well-tailored oxide/metal interface facilitates the formation of active species.

Unlike the conventional viewpoint of focusing on single active site, the concept of local microstructure active zone is more comprehensive and new methods to regulate the reaction zone for electrocatalytic reactions are developed accordingly. The local microstructure active zone refers to the zone with high catalytic activity formed by the interaction between active atoms and neighboring coordination atoms as well as the surrounding environment. Instead of the traditional single active atom site, the active zone is more suitable for the actual electrochemical reaction process. According to this concept, the activity of electrocatalysts can be coordinated by multiple active atoms. This strategy is beneficial for understanding the relationship between material, structure, and catalysis, which realizes the design and synthesis of high-performance electrocatalysts. This review provides the research progress of this strategy for electrocatalytic reactions, with emphasis on their applications in oxygen evolution reaction, urea oxidation reaction, and carbon dioxide reduction.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0947-6539	1521-3765		WOS:000728686500001	34734654

The electrodes were prepared as films on a nickel substrate by painting with an oxide-slurry, followed by sintering at 400 degrees C. The electrocatalytic activity for O-2 evolution was found to be a maximum with the MnFe2O4 electrode. Based on the observed current density at 0.625 V, the activity of MnFe2O4 was 20 times higher than that of Fe3O4. The reaction followed approximately second-order kinetics in [OH-] at the pure and manganese-substituted ferrite film electrodes. The Tafel slope values were ca. RT/F on Fe3O4 and Mn0.5Fe2.5O4 and ca. 2RT/3F on MnFe2O4 and Mn1.5Fe1.5O4. Based on the electrode kinetic results, a reaction mechanism for oxygen evolution is suggested.									67	0	0	0	1	0	68			0956-5000			WOS:A1996UY18600012

Herein, we adopt a multi-step consequential induced strategy to construct a bifunctional electrocatalyst for the overall water splitting. Graphene oxide (GO) was used as a carbon matrix and in situ oxygen source, which was supported by the octahedral PtNi alloy to form the PtxNiy-GO precursor. When calcinating in Ar atmosphere, the oxygen in GO induced the surface segregation of Ni from the PtNi octahedron to form a core-shell structure of Pt-x@Ni-y. Then, the surface-enriched Ni continuously induced the reformation of C in reduced graphene oxide (rGO) to enhance the degree of graphitization. This multi-step induction formed a nanocatalyst Pt-x (C)Ni-y-rGO which has very high catalytic efficiency and stability. By optimizing the feeding ratio of PtNi (Pt:Ni = 1:2), the electrolytic overall water splitting at 10 mA cm(-2) can be driven by an electrolytic voltage of as low as 1.485 V, and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) only needs an overpotential of 37 mV in 1.0 M KOH aqueous solution. Additionally, the catalyst exhibited consistent existence form in both HER and oxygen evolution reaction (OER), which was verified by switching the anode and cathode of the cell in the electrolysis of water. This work provides a new idea for the synthesis and evaluation of the bifunctional catalysts for water splitting.									10	0	0	0	0	0	10			1998-0124	1998-0000		WOS:000694799100001

Herein, we report the construction of a new class of 3D hollow nanoflower catalysts that assembled by ultrathin nickel-molybdenum phosphide nanosheets. Owing to the increased electronic and ion transport channels, the heteroatom doping, and synergistic effects from the interconnected compositions, the newly-generated 3D MoNiP hollow nanoflowers display superior OER activity than that of Ir/C. And the optimized Mo1Ni1P hollow nanoflowers (Mo1Ni1P HNFs) can afford a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at the overpotential of 275 mV in 1.0 M KOH solution. More importantly, the resultant Mo1Ni1P HNFs also display excellent stability with negligible activity and morphology decay. This work provides insights for the utilization of earth-abundant and highly efficient electrocatalysts via rationally designing the morphology of electrocatalysts. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc.

Their reconstruction phenomena, that are closely associated with actual contributions and intrinsic catalytic mechanisms, are expected to be well summarized. Here, the recent advances in understanding reconstruction chemistry of coordination compounds are reviewed, including their main classifications and structural properties, reconstruction phenomena in electrocatalysis (e.g., oxygen/hydrogen evolution reaction, CO2 reduction), influence factors of reconstruction parameters (e.g., reconstruction rate and reconstruction degree), and reconstruction-performance correlation. It is outlined that the reconstruction processes are influenced by electronic structure of coordination compounds, pH and temperature of testing solution, and applied potentials. The characterization techniques reflecting the evolution information before and after catalysis are also introduced for reconstruction-related mechanistic study. Finally, some challenges and outlooks on reconstruction investigations of coordination compounds are proposed, and the necessity of studying and understanding of these themes under actual working conditions of devices is highlighted.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			1613-6810	1613-6829		WOS:000674497700001	34288417

Herein, hybrid Ni5P4 @FeP nanosheet arrays were evaluated as promising OER pre-catalysts. The dynamic surface evolution was probed by in situ Raman spectroscopy, which revealed that Ni5P4 @FeP was rapidly reconstructed to NiFe2O4 during the anodic scan. The structural instability of amorphous NiFe2O4 led to partial reconstitution to Ni/FeOOH at high oxidation potentials. As-formed Ni/FeOOH@NiFe2O4 hybrid with high structural reversibility was established as a truly active species, which exhibited excellent alkaline OER performance with a low overpotential of 205 and 242 mV under current densities of 10 and 100 mA cm(-2), respectively.

Herein, we designed phosphate doped Ni(OH)2/FeOOH hierarchical microtubes (denoted as POx-Ni(OH)2/FeOOH HMTs), obtained by phosphate doped NiFe Prussian blue analogue hierarchical microtubes (denoted as P-NF-PBA HMTs) completely reconstructing in OER process. POxNi(OH)2/FeOOH HMTs possess an extremely low overpotential of 237 mV at 30 mA cm-2 in alkaline electrolyte with the Tafel slope of 35 mV dec-1, and the catalysts can maintain excellent durability for 100 h at 30 mA cm-2. The remarkable electrochemical catalytic activity comes from the advantages of the hierarchical hollow structure, the modulation of electronic structure caused by phosphate doping, and the synergistic effect of Ni(OH)2 and FeOOH species produced by catalyst complete reconstruction in the OER process.

Understanding the mechanism of IrOx under realistic photoelectrochemical conditions is important for the development of integrated water-splitting systems. Herein, we have developed a highly efficient OER photoanode in pH 1 aqueous solutions based on a sputtered IrOx film and a p(+)n-Si light absorber, interfaced with a sputtered Au layer. Operando high-energy-resolution fluorescence detection X-ray absorption spectroscopy (HERFD XAS) was employed to monitor the oxidation state changes of IrOx during both electrochemical and photoelectrochemical (PEC) water oxidation reactions in pH 1 aqueous solutions. We observed a gradual increase of the average oxidation state of Ir with increasing anodic potential in the precatalytic region, followed by a reduction of Ir under O-2 evolution conditions. Consistent results were obtained on dark anodes and illuminated photoanodes. However, when the thickness of IrO2 was increased to 2 and 3 nm, the spectral changes became much less pronounced, and the reduction of Ir oxidation state after the OER onset was not observed. This is due to the lower surface-to-bulk ratio, where lattice oxygen sites in the bulk are not accessible for the formation of hydroxide. More generally, the operando method developed here can be extended to other materials, thereby providing a powerful tool for mechanism discovery and an enabling capability for catalyst design.									14	0	0	0	0	0	14			2574-0962			WOS:000459948900051

In this work, iron doped strontium titanates with a general formula SrTi1-xFexO3-delta (x = 0.35, 0.50, 0.70, 0.90, and 1.00) denoted as STFx, were synthesized via a solid state reaction technique and characterized in terms of oxygen evolution reaction electrocatalysis in an alkaline electrolyte (0.1 M KOH). The produced powders were characterized by a high specific surface area (>20 m(2) g(-1)), beneficial for OER. The evaluation of specific activity indicated the following trend of increasing performance: STF35 < STF50 < STF70 < SFO < STF90. The lowest overpotential at 10 mAcm(-2) (GEO) of 410 mV (350 mV at 25 mu A cm(OX)(-2)) was achieved by STF90 with the corresponding Tafel slope of 60 mV dec(-1). The two materials with the highest Fe content (i.e. STF90 and SFO) showed, however, poor chemical stability in alkaline solution demonstrated by the dissolution of Sr. Based on the good electrochemical performance (similar to 460 mV at 10 mA cm(GEO)(-2), similar to 405 mV at 25 mu A cm(OX)(-2)) and chemical stability for at least 30 days (no Sr dissolution) of STF50, it can be considered an interesting, working at room temperature OER catalyst based on non-toxic and abundant elements.

However, developing efficient approaches to further improve the catalytic ability of the well-defined nanostructured catalysts is still a big challenge. Herein, we report a facile and universal cation-exchange process for synthesizing Fe-doped Ni(OH)(2) and Co(OH)(2) nanosheets with enriched active sites toward enhanced oxygen evolution reaction (OER). In comparison with typical NiFe layered double hydroxide (LDH) nanosteets prepared by the conventional one-pot method, Fe-doped Ni(OH)(2) nanosheets evolving from Ni(OH)(2) via an Fe3+/ Ni2+ cation-exchange process possess nanoporous surfaces with abundant defects. Accordingly, Fe-doped Ni(OH)(2) nanosheets exhibit higher electrochemical active surface area (ECSA) and improved surface wettability in comparison to NiFe LDH nanosheets and deliver significantly enhanced catalytic activity over NiFe LDH. Specifically, a low overpotential of only 245 mV is required to reach a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) for Ni0.83Fe0.17(OH)(2) nanosheets with a low Tafel slope of 61 mV dec(-1), which is greatly decreased in comparison with those of NiFe LDH (310 mV and 78 mV dec-1). Additionally, this cation exchange process is successfully extended to prepare Fe-doped Co(OH)(2) nanosheets with improved catalytic activity for oxygen evolution. The results suggest that this cation-exchange process should have great potential in the rational design of defect enriched catalysts toward high-performance electrocatalysis.									208	16	0	0	7	0	215			2155-5435			WOS:000434369600066

Studies on oxygen evolution reaction performance of porous Co3O4-NiO-B2O3 composites								CHEMICAL PAPERS											10.1007/s11696-022-02526-0		OCT 2022			2022	In this article, Co3O4-NiO-B2O3 composites were synthesized via a simple solution combustion method where B2O3 composition is varied from 0 to 50%. The oxygen evolution performance of the Co3O4-NiO-B2O3 composites was investigated. The 40% of B2O3 added Co3O4-NiO composite exhibits an enhanced OER performance where it requires low overpotential of 322 mV (1.54 V vs. RHE) to reach the current density of 50 mA cm(-2), which is much lower than that of the 738 mV (1.96 V vs. RHE) and 492 mV (1.72 V vs. RHE) exhibited by bare screen printed electrode (SPE) and pristine Co3O4-NiO composite, respectively. The enhanced OER performance is attributed to significant enhancement in the accessible surface active sites and decrease in charge transfer resistance. Further, the NCB40 shows excellent OER stability and durability over 25 h of continuous electrolysis.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0366-6352	2585-7290		WOS:000865674900003

In the present study, Fe doped Ni3S2 nanosheets have been directly grown on nickel foam via a facile hydrothermal process. The OER electrocatalytic activity of Fe-Ni3S2/NF can be enhanced by adjusting the addition amount of Fe. It requires an overpotential of 246 mV to afford a current density of 20 mA cm(-2) and a Tafel slope of 66 mV dec(-1), significantly lower than that of Ni3S2/NF electrode. This catalyst is highly stable, showing a slight overpotential rise of 15.1 mV over continuous testing for 20 h. In addition, combine EIS measurement and density functional theory calculations, revealing that Fe doped Ni3S2/Ni electrodes have both high conductivity and excellent intrinsic activity, leading to a promising OER electrocatalytic activity.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			1572-6657	1873-2569		WOS:000767881100006

Herein, we used quasi in situ scanning electron microscopy and energy-dispersive X-ray spectrometry to investigate the structural transformation of the precatalyst V8C7 microparticles during extended cyclic voltammetric (CV) OER testing. Interestingly, an anisotropic morphological transformation (from a distorted sphere to a cuboid) of V8C7 was observed. Our theoretical and experimental results strongly suggest that this morphological change happens due to the selective self-oxidation and dissolution of the V8C7(110) and (111) surfaces and the subsequent exposure of the relatively stable (100), (010), and (001) surfaces. These results also suggest that these stable facets are preferable for the OER, and a current density of 10 mA.cm(-2) was delivered at an overpotential of 503 mV after the extended CV OER testing.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			2168-0485			WOS:000575352800024

Based on the Sabatier principle, which suggests a not too strong, nor too weak binding of reaction intermediates as prerequisite for high reaction rates, it provides a straightforward and intuitive explanation for a plethora of experimental results. However, while the Sabatier principle as a main paradigm of heterogeneous catalysis was never really disputed in the case of gas-phase reactions, it remains questionable if it can be the main driving principle that governs activity trends of electrocatalytic reactions. This work provides an overview on this topic for the model hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), pointing out certain inconsistencies and contradictions found in literature. The critical assessment provides a viewpoint which could have important practical consequences and could provide different perspective on future catalyst design.									165	4	0	0	9	0	166			1040-0397	1521-4109		WOS:000387886500002

Fe and N co-doped carbon (Fe-N-C) catalysts have drawn great attention due to their low cost and good performance in the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and recently in the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Based on the recent advances of a variety of physical characterization techniques, more information about the chemical environment of the catalytic active sites has been acquired. However, due to the complexity of the catalytic material and process, the real active structures are still controversial. In this work, several active sites are proposed for Fe-N-C catalysts (L-FeNx, x = 2 or 4, L = nothing, O or OH) and their performance in electrochemical ORR and the OER are investigated. The computations are based on density functional theory (DFT), including Van der Waals interaction and solvation effect with an implicit electrolyte model. Calculations indicate that the catalytic activity of the Fe centers depends strongly on the N coordination number and on the presence of extra ligands like OH group. In particular, HO-FeN2, but not FeN4, appears as the most active site. Scaling relations are obtained by connecting the free energy of potential-determining steps with the adsorption free energy of intermediates. Furthermore, three promising active sites suggested from scaling relations are studied by the more elaborate surface charging approach, which includes the influence of the applied potential and the electrolyte. The results show that the specific treatment of the influence of the applied potential has a minor influence at low potential, which is the case for the ORR, but a major influence at higher potential, as for the OER, changing the calculated overpotential by up to 0.34 V.									20	0	0	0	1	0	20			2044-4753	2044-4761		WOS:000518579100006

The one-dimensional CoC2O4 structure was fabricated by a facile anodization process, i.e., reacting the Co metal surface with oxalate ions. The dense CoC2O4 nanowires were evenly distributed on the Co substrate. By thermal treatment, Co3O4 one-dimensional structures were easily formed from CoC2O4 structures. In addition, we confirmed that fabricated CoC2O4 could also be transformed to Co(OH)(2) with one-dimensional structures via a spontaneous chemical reaction in alkaline, which serves better electrocatalytic performance for an OER.									26	2	0	0	1	0	26			1932-7447			WOS:000327110500031

However, this reaction is known to be kinetically sluggish and proceeds at rather high overpotential due to the universal scaling relationship, namely, the adsorption energies of intermediates are linearly correlated and cannot be optimized simultaneously. Several approaches have been proposed to break the scaling relationship by introducing additional active sites; however, positive experimental results are still absent. Herein, a different solution is suggested on the basis of dynamic tridimensional adsorption of the OER intermediates at NiO/NiFe layered double hydroxide intersection, by which the adsorption energy of each intermediate can be adjusted independently, so as to bypass the scaling relationship and achieve high catalytic performance. Experimentally, the OER overpotential is reduced to approximate to 205 mV at current density of 30 mA cm(-2), which represents the best performance achieved by state-of-the-art OER catalysts.									200	18	0	0	9	0	203			0935-9648	1521-4095		WOS:000461575300003	30680808

However, its sluggish kinetics severely limits the development of next-generation energy technologies. Recently, two-dimensional(2D) metal-organic frameworks(MOFs) have attracted much attention as a class of promising electrocatalysts. Their diverse components and tunable structures provide a new platform to design and explore ideal electrocatalysts. The ultrathin characteristics including high specific surface area, abundant exposed metal sites and fast electronic transfer further promote the electrocatalytic performance of 2D MOFs. Therefore, many attempts have been made in synthesizing 2D MOF-based electrocatalysts in recent years. This review focuses on the strategies to fabricate 2D MOFs with high electrocatalytic performances for OER. The discussion on challenge and development of their electrocatalytic application is also presented.									16	4	0	0	0	0	17			1005-9040	2210-3171		WOS:000551737100002

Herein, a cheap and effective catalyst mixed with alpha-MnO2 and nitrogen-doped Ketjenblack (N-KB) (denoted as MnO2-SM150-0.5) is examined as a potential electrocatalyst in oxygen reduction reactions (ORR) and oxygen evolution reactions (OER). This alpha-MnO2 is prepared by redox reaction between K2S2O8 and MnSO4 in acid conditions with a facile hydrothermal process (named the SM method). As a result, MnO2-SM150-0.5 exhibits a good catalytic performance for ORR in alkaline solution, and this result is comparable to a Pt/C catalyst. Moreover, this catalyst also shows superior durability and methanol tolerance compared with a Pt/C catalyst. It also displays a discharge voltage (similar to 1.28 V) at a discharge density of 50 mA cm(-2) in homemade Al-air batteries that is higher than commercial 20% Pt/C (similar to 1.19 V). The superior electrocatalytic performance of MnO2-SM150-0.5 could be attributed to its higher Mn3+/Mn4+ ratio and the synergistic effect between MnO2 and the nitrogen-doped KB. This study provides a novel strategy for the preparation of an MnO2-based composite electrocatalyst.									38	1	0	0	2	0	40			1996-1944			WOS:000434710200143

The results showed that the apparent activation energy of the anode reaction for bauxite electrolysis with a low slurry concentration was lower than that of water electrolysis, indicating that the bauxite particles had some microcell disturbance effects on liquid diffusion. As expected, it was also lower than that of bauxite electrolysis with a high slurry concentration, indicating that the bauxite particles had some inhibition effects on oxygen evolution. Compared with adding bauxite, the increase in stirring speed did not change the concentration polarization of water electrolysis, indicating that the microcell disturbance effect of the bauxite particles was more important. Compared with the low slurry concentration electrolysis, the high slurry concentration electrolysis resulted in a low desulfurization ratio and high current efficiency during bauxite electrolysis.									13	0	0	0	0	0	13			0888-5885			WOS:000402690800005

The traditional removal of NO is hindered by the harsh operating conditions and sacrifice of value-added chemicals. Efficient electrocatalytic oxidation of NO was achieved over plasma-treated commercial carbon cloth, serving as a promising anode substitution reaction to couple with the hydrogen evolution reaction without consumption of hydrogen-containing resources. The introduction of carboxyl groups onto the carbon cloth boosted the electrocatalytic activity via the enhancement of NO chemisorption. Only potentials of 1.39 V and 1.07 V were applied to reach the current density of 10 mA cm(-2) in neutral and acidic conditions, respectively, which is superior to the state-of-the-art electrocatalysts for oxygen evolution. Energy and environmental concerns on fossil-fuel-derived hydrogen production, ammonia manufacture and nitrate synthesis, are greatly alleviated. This work provides an original strategy to realize the resource utilization of NO, the sustainable nitrate synthesis and hydrogen production in a green and economical way.									13	0	0	0	0	0	13			1433-7851	1521-3773		WOS:000704319900001	34427033

However, the difficulty in promoting both processes simultaneously hinders the realization of overall water splitting (OWS) over this material. Herein, we demonstrate the activation and stabilization of BaTaO2N-based photocatalysts for visible-light-driven OWS by combining flux-assisted nitridation with Mg doping and co-loading of Cr2O3/(Na)Rh and IrO2 co-catalysts. RbCl-assisted nitridation produced single-crystal BaTaO2N particles doped with Mg and so promoted charge transfer to the co-catalysts. The coloading of Cr2O3/(Na)Rh and IrO2 at moderate temperatures as co-catalysts to promote the hydrogen and oxygen evolution reactions, respectively, allowed the BaTaO2N photocatalyst to evolve hydrogen and oxygen simultaneously from water. This work highlights the importance of carefully tuning semiconducting and catalytic properties to realize effective charge transfer when preparing narrow-bandgap oxynitrides for OWS.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			2155-5435			WOS:000840981500001

However, it is still a great challenge to rationally design robust MOF catalysts with reasonable ligands due to the lack of research on tunable structure architecture. Herein, a series of Fe-based MOFs with tunable ligands have been designed and synthesized for OER for the first time. The functionalized Fe-MOFs-NHCHO and Fe-MOFs-NO2 derived catalysts show higher OER activity than the pristine Fe-MOFs. Remarkably, the best-performing Fe-MOFs-NHCHO shows an ultra-low overpotential of 246 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2), which is 37 mV lower than Fe-MOFs. This research provides a new design concept based on MOFs materials, in the hope of finding excellent OER catalysts.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			1867-3880	1867-3899		WOS:000704679300001

Nevertheless, its wide applications are always restricted by slow dynamics and limited durability. This paper reports a type of Mn-doped RuO2 nanocrystals for boosting the OER catalytic performance in acidic media. The catalyst (named Mn-RuO2) is prepared through annealing of Ru-exchanged Mn-based derivative at 300 degrees C. Such Mn-RuO2 exhibits excellent acidic OER activity, with an overpotential of 158 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) and a stability of 5000 cycles in the presence of sulfuric acid (0.5 mol/L). Both structural characterization and theoretical analysis show that the Mn doping in RuO2 can tune the d-band center of Ru active sites and lower antibonding surface-adsorbate states, which leads to a decreased free energy of the rate-determining step, ultimately enhancing the intrinsic activity of RuO2.									126	6	0	0	5	0	129			2155-5435			WOS:000508466700020

Water electrolysis is a sustainable way for large-scale hydrogen production when electricity is generated from renewable energy resources. The key challenge in water splitting is the sluggish kinetics of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Thus, it is important and necessary to develop highly efficient electrocatalysts in a cost-effective way for OER. Porous materials have proven to be versatile in catalysis due to their large surface area, the fast mass diffusion, and the buffer ability of volume change. Herein, we summarize the recent progress of representative methodologies for the synthesis of porous materials toward electrocatalytic OER. The materials discussed in this Review include the cheap transition-metal-based (Co, Ni, and Fe) and metal-free porous materials. This Review sheds light on the different strategies to construct catalysts with porous structures to facilitate OER.									56	4	0	0	1	0	58			1867-3880	1867-3899		WOS:000428375400001

Based on the density functional theory, we investigate the HER catalytic activity of a serials of transition metal atoms (TM = V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni) implanted into or anchored on Ti3C2O2 as a low-cost 2D electrocatalyst with high thermodynamic stability. The results show that compared with the host Ti, the dopant TM donates less electrons to its adjacent oxygen atoms, leading to a stronger H and O bonding, while the anchored TM atom donates excess electrons to its adjacent oxygen atoms, leading to the extremely weak H and O bonding. For TM-anchored Ti3C2O2, those oxygen sites far away from TM exhibit the optimal hydrogen adsorption free energy because of their moderate electrons, indicating that the active sites and catalytic performance of Ti3C2O2 are both modulated by TM atoms.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000691508500005

Herein, we reported a fast electro-deposition of highly efficient NiFe alloy onto three-dimension nickel foam (NF). Benefiting from the hierarchical structure, NiFe/NF exhibits high OER efficiency with a low onset potential and a low over-potential (191 mV at 10 mA cm(-2)), which outperforms the commercial catalyst and most reported catalysts up-to-date. Also, it shows a remarkably low Tafel slope of 44.1 mV as well as a long-time stability that the potential increased less than 10mV after 30000 s OER at 100mA cm(-2). NiFe/NF is expected to surpass the commercial catalyst to serve as a non-noble-metal-based electrocatalyst for OER practical application. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Herein, a unique and universal self-template strategy has been developed to fabricate Fe-incorporated CoNi (oxy)hydroxide (Fe-CoNi-OH) nanosheet-assembled nanorod arrays toward OER. The reorganized nanosheet-assembled nanorod hierarchical structure induced by Fe incorporation exposes more active sites and facilitates mass transfer. Furthermore, Fe incorporation modifies the electron structure of CoNi (oxy)hydroxide (CoNi-OH), and enhances its electronic conductivity for rapid electron transport, thus intrinsically enhancing the OER activity. Consequently, the Fe-CoNi-OH possesses excellent OER activity with low overpotentials of 210, 248, 304, and 349 mV to achieve current densities of 10, 100, 500, and 1000 mA cm(-2), respectively, along with a very small Tafel slope of 28.0 mV dec(-1), which are superior to the CoNi-OH and benchmark RuO2. By paring the Fe-CoNi-OH anode with a CoP cathode, an outstanding alkaline electrolyzer has been constructed, which only requires cell voltages of 1.506 and 1.623 V to deliver current densities of 10 and 100 mA cm(-2), respectively, and can stably work for 100 h. This work provides a universal strategy to synthesize Fe-containing hierarchical nanostructured catalysts for energy conversion application.									46	1	0	0	2	0	46			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000579752500036

TRENDS IN PLANT SCIENCE				24	11			1008	1021		10.1016/j.tplants.2019.06.016				NOV 2019	2019	One of the earliest events in the molecular evolution of photosynthesis is the structural and functional specialisation of type I (ferredoxin-reducing) and type II (quinone-reducing) reaction centres. In this opinion article we point out that the homodimeric type I reaction centre of heliobacteria has a calcium-binding site with striking structural similarities to the Mn4CaO5 duster of photosystem II. These similarities indicate that most of the structural elements required to evolve water oxidation chemistry were present in the earliest reaction centres. We suggest that the divergence of type I and type 11 reaction centres was made possible by a drastic structural shift linked to a change in redox properties that coincided with or facilitated the origin of photosynthetic water oxidation.									26	0	0	0	13	0	26			1360-1385	1878-4372		WOS:000493287600008	31351761

In view of the multi-step catalytic reaction in electrocatalytic oxygen evolution, NiSe2 and CoSe2 with the same crystallographic space group are selected to construct NiSe2/CoSe2 nanosheet arrays on carbon cloth by a facile layered double hydroxides (LDHs) selenization derived method. Moreover, the effect of phosphorus doping on electronic structure and electrocatalytic activity of NiSe2/CoSe2 is also investigated. When the mole ratio of phosphorus to selenium is 10%, the prepared phosphorus-doped NiSe2/CoSe2 nanosheet arrays (10%P-NiSe2/CoSe2) show superior oxygen evolution reaction (OER) performance in alkaline media. It exhibits a small overpotential of 287 mV to realize a current density of 50 mA cm(-2) and a low Tafel slope of 68 my dec(-1) in 1 M KOH solution. Furthermore, the cyclic stability test displays that the current density of 10%P-NiSe2/CoSe2 only decreases from 30.0 to 26.5 mA cm(-2), after 12 h of continuous water oxidation reaction at 270 mV overpotential. The excellent OER activity of 10%P-NiSe2/CoSe2 can be attributed to the changes in charge density on the crystal surface and the lattice distortion in crystal caused by phosphorus doping. Our work provides an efficient approach for designing OER electrocatalysts through a LDHs derivation assembling with an anion doping method. (C) 2022 Elsevier B.V.

Herein, a facile reduction-induced surface reconstruction process was proposed for fabricating cobalt hydroxide/molybdenum oxide hybrid nanosheets with high porosity, rough surface and facile charge transport behavior. Benefitted from the structural merits, the highly porous ?-Co(OH)2/Mo9O26 hybrid nanosheets exhibit an ultralow overpotential of 279 mV for achieving a 10 mA cm-2 current density and a high current density of 225.2 mA cm-2 at 1.8 V vs. RHE. In addition, a remarkable normalized current density of 11.9 A F-1 can be identified at ? = 400 mV, which is much larger than previously reported Co-based catalysts and even benchmarking RuO2 and IrO2. Moreover, for CoMoO-r displays stable OER activity towards long-term operation with no performance degradation but obvious enhancement even for 72 h. The high OER activity combined with the excellent stability makes the hybrid catalyst a promising candidate for commercial water splitting.									12	1	0	0	1	0	12			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000638233600005

In recent years, LMDs with more exposed electrochemically active sites have been explored as cost-effective alternatives for the water-splitting reaction. However, morphology engineering and heterostructure synthesis of LMDs through low-cost and high-yield methods are still challenging. Herein, we present a simple and facile wet-chemical method to synthesize few-layered MoSe2 and WSe2 nanoflowers with a large number of exposed edges. Temperature-controlled reactions reveal the faster synthesis of MoSe2 as compared to WSe2. Exploiting the faster kinetics of the synthesis of MoSe2, we have synthesized a hierarchical heterostructure of MoSe2@WSe2 through a one-step synthesis method. The as-synthesized nanostructures were used for the water-splitting reaction that involves the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) at the cathode and the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) at the anode. The hierarchical nanostructure exhibits better electrocatalytic activity among the as-synthesized nanostructures. The hierarchical nanostructure requires an overpotential of 231 mV (HER) and 300 mV (OER) to achieve a current density of 10 mA cm(-2).

Herein, the hierarchical Co3O4/ CoO nanowires@Cu micro-pillars with abundant oxygen vacancies (VOs) were designed and directly grown on nickel foam, combining robust integrated electrode. This electrode shows a superb OER performance with an overpotential of 304 mV at 100 mA cm-2. Particularly, it could achieve the industrially required 1000 mA cm-2 at an overpotential of 391 mV, superior to most reported electrodes. The hierarchical structure of electrode, high conductivity of introduced Cu micro-pillars, and porous structure of Ni foam provide large specific surface areas and open channels for fast mass and electron transfers. DFT calculation reveals the H2O molecules and the intermediate of OH* are preferably adsorbed on Co(III) site near VOs due to increased oxygen vacancies, which promotes electrocatalytic performance.

Herein, we report the in situ preparation of an efficient OER electrocatalyst CoFePi/Ni(PO3)(2) on carbon cloth (CC) by decorating amorphous CoFe phosphate (CoFePi) on crystalline nickel phosphate (Ni(PO3)(2)). The as-synthesized hierarchically heterogeneous electrocatalyst can be directly used as a working electrode for the OER without extra substrates or binders. Electrocatalytic studies showed that the CoFePi/Ni(PO3)(2)/CC electrode displays excellent OER catalytic activity and stability. A current density of 10 mA cm(-2) during the OER process can be achieved at a low overpotential of 213 mV in 1.0 M KOH solution, comparable to the results reported for the most efficient OER electrocatalysts. The ultrahigh oxygen evolution activity and high durability are ascribed to the unique 3D hierarchical heterogeneous nanostructure and in situ generated amorphous-crystalline composite, as well as the highly conductive substrate of CC, which endows the composite catalyst with sufficient active sites, strong structural stability and good electrical conductivity.

The resulting material shows a low overpotential of 263 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) and a Tafel slope of 74 mV dec(-1) in 1.0 M KOH. The morphology and properties of the material before and after electrocatalysis did not change significantly over a long period of time and it maintained electrochemical stability for 12 000 s. The unsaturated CoII active center on the surface of the ultrathin two-dimensional cobalt-organic framework nanosheets enhances their oxygen evolution reaction performance. These results are significantly superior to most of the previously reported transition metal-organic framework or metal oxide electrocatalysts. We believe that the ultrathin two-dimensional metal-organic framework nanosheets synthesized by this simple process will be widely used in future energy conversion devices.									205	13	0	0	9	0	209			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000456724800037

The process requires a highly active electrocatalyst for oxygen evolution to improve the overall water splitting efficiency. The present study showed that oxygen evolution improved dramatically upon the addition of glycine to cobalt phosphate, when the glycine was added to the electrolyte solution during electrodeposition. The functionality of the organic molecules was investigated using in situ UV-vis absorption, in situ X-ray absorption fine structure, and in situ infrared (IR) absorption spectroscopy in the attenuated total reflection mode. The results demonstrated that the glycine molecules assembled cobalt oxide clusters composed of CoO6 (CoOOH) octahedrons a few nanometers in diameter upon the electrodeposition of cobalt catalysts. This suggests that the cobalt-glycine catalyst can decompose water to oxygen gas efficiently, because the number of cobalt oxide clusters increased as active reaction sites upon the addition of glycine molecules.									7	0	0	0	0	0	7			0910-6340	1348-2246		WOS:000817311800006	31761817

The reaction leads to the evolution of hydrogen which reduces partly the polyacid, and to the formation of a [Et2MeSi] species interacting weakly with the polyoxometalate.

The diffusion coefficient and solubility of oxygen in these mixed electrolytes are determined by nonlinear fitting of potential-step chronoamperometry obtained at a platinum micro electrode. The mixed electrolytes exhibit enhanced oxygen diffusion coefficient (6.2-11.3 X 10(-6) cm(2) s(-1)) compared to neat ILs, and solubility (2.9-6.8 mM), compared to DMSO. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) shows that all the IL-mixed electrolytes display good stability against superoxide (O-2(center dot-)) except for 1-butyl-3-methyl-pyridinium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide [BMPy][NTf2], where the generated superoxide is found to be unstable and reacts with the cations of the IL. Using digital simulation of cyclic voltammograms for ORR, the heterogeneous rate constant, k(het), for reduction of O-2 to O-2(center dot-) in these mixed electrolytes is obtained (k(het) = 3.6-3.9 x 10(-3) cm s(-1)). The presence of Li+ in the mixed electrolytes shows minor influence on the k(het). The cations of ILs show strong interaction with O-2(center dot-) thus stabilizing the ORR products. The role of anions of ILs on the stability of electrolytes and reversibility of ORR-OER processes is also investigated.					6th International Congress on Ionic Liquids (COIL-6)6th International Congress on Ionic Liquids (COIL-6)	JUN 16-20, 2015JUN 16-20, 2015		Jeju City, SOUTH KOREAJeju City, SOUTH KOREA	11	2	0	0	1	0	13			2168-0485			WOS:000369347800016

Besides traditional noble-metal-based catalysts, carbon-based materials have been found to be effective for catalyzing these reactions. Various carbon structures doped with heteroatoms (N, S, P, B, and transition metals) and graphitic-layer-encapsulated metal and compound particles have shown good activities toward HER and OER at universal pHs. In this Perspective, recent research on the development of carbon-based electrocatalysts for HER and OER, as well as their challenges and opportunities are discussed.									305	12	0	0	15	0	307			2155-5435			WOS:000414724700057

Mono/few-layered TMDs have been widely explored as active electrocatalysts for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). A controlled synthesis of TMD nanostructures with unique structural and electronic properties, leading to highly active sites or higher conductivity, is essential to achieve enhanced HER activity. Here, we demonstrate a new approach to controllably synthesize highly catalytically active oxygen-incorporated 1T and 2H WS2 nanoclusters from oxygen deficient WO3 nanorods, following chemical exfoliation and ultrasonication processes, respectively. The as-synthesized 1T nanoclusters, with unique properties of tailored edge sites, and enhanced conductivity resulting from the metallic 1T phase and oxygen incorporation, have been identified as highly active and promising electrocatalysts for the HER, with a very low Tafel slope of 47 mV per decade and a low onset overpotential of 88 mV, along with exceptionally high exchange current density and very good stability. The study could be extended to other TMD materials for potential applications in energy conversion and storage.									58	1	0	0	2	0	58			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000433260300012	29737994

The modified glassy carbon electrode was then prepared by casting the graphene aerogel solution followed by immersing the GA/GCE in Co+2 solution. The results showed that graphene aerogels improved the adsorption ability of the Co (II) ions. The electrocatalysis of oxygen evolution reaction (OER) at the Co-GA modified glassy carbon electrode (Co-GA/GCE) has been investigated using linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) in alkaline solution. The OER was noticeably enhanced at Co-GA/GCE, representing a negative shift in the LSV curve at the Co-GA/GCE compared to that obtained at the bare GCE. The high electrocatalytic activity, good reproducibility and low cost of proposed electrode provides desired characteristics of a potential candidate in the industrial water electrolysis process.									3	0	0	0	1	0	3			0009-4536	2192-6549		WOS:000380228600005

The controllable surface composition, oxygen vacancies together with hierarchical micro/nanoarchitectures resulted in superior electrochemical properties when used as the anode materials for lithium-ion batteries and as an electro-catalyst for the oxygen evolution reaction. The excellent electrochemical performance is attributed to the synergistic effects of novel hierarchical morphology, crystal structure of the active materials, the improvement of intrinsic conductivity and inner surface area induced by the oxygen vacancies. The present strategy not only provides a facile method to assemble novel hierarchical architectures, but also paves a way to control surface structures (chemical composition and crystal defects) in other transition-metal compounds, and thus will hold great promise in the fields of energy storage and conversion.									65	4	0	0	3	0	66			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000412407300016	28920625

Furthermore, an ultrathin Fe-ion-containing polydopamine layer has been introduced to generate highly effective FeNxC active sites into the carbon framework and to induce a high degree of graphitization. The synergistic effects between the hierarchically porous 1D carbon structure and the embedded FeNxC active sites in the carbon framework manifest in superior catalytic activity toward oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) compared to Pt/C catalyst in both alkaline and acidic media. A rechargeable zinc-air battery assembled in a decoupled configuration with the nonprecious pCNT@Fe@GL/CNF ORR electrode and Ni-Fe LDH/NiF oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrode exhibits charge-discharge overpotentials similar to the counterparts of Pt/C ORR electrode and IrO2 OER electrode.									119	25	0	0	5	0	121			0935-9648	1521-4095		WOS:000404982700004	28437022

The photochemically prepared CoAc catalyst is chemically and morphologically similar to the electrochemically prepared CoAc catalyst. The on-set potential of oxygen evolution reaction is lower on CoAc-ZnO photoanode in relation to bare ZnO photoanode. There is a three to four fold increase in photooxidation current of OER due to the presence of CoAc co-catalyst on ZnO. Thus, the photochemically prepared CoAc on ZnO is an alternative and efficient co-catalyst for photoelectrochemical oxygen evolution reaction. The enhancement in photocatalytic activity of ZnO by the CoAc catalyst photochemically deposited from acetate buffer solution is significantly greater than the cobalt-phosphate (CoPi) co-catalyst deposited from phosphate buffer solution.
