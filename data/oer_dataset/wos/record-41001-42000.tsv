We report the characterization by ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy of reactively radio-frequency sputtered II-IV-nitride -ZnSnN2 thin films. For samples transferred in high vacuum, the -ZnSnN2 surface work function was 4.0 +/- 0.1 eV below the vacuum level, with a valence-band onset of 1.2 +/- 0.1 eV below the Fermi level. The resulting band diagram indicates that the degenerate bulk Fermi level position in -ZnSnN2 shifts to mid-gap at the surface due to band bending that results from equilibration with delocalized surface states within the gap. Brief (<10 s) exposures to air, a nitrogen-plasma treatment, or argon-ion sputtering caused significant chemical changes at the surface, both in surface composition and interfacial energetics. The relative band positioning of the n-type semi-conductor against standard redox potentials indicated that -ZnSnN2 has an appropriate energy band alignment for use as a photoanode to effect the oxygen-evolution reaction.									12	0	0	0	0	0	12			0947-8396	1432-0630		WOS:000416484200003

In this study, the SOFC real delivered voltage is defined by the Nernst potentials and overpotentials due to the activation polarizations of the chemical reactions in the anode and the cathode, the losses due to the species concentration in these two electrodes (anode and cathode), and the ohmic losses caused by the Joule's effect in the electrolyte and both electrodes. The obtained results show that the SOFC power density is proportional to the variations of the operating temperature and the oxygen concentration in the oxidizer; conversely, it is inversely proportional to the evolutions of the fuel humidification and the thicknesses of the electrolyte, cathode and anode. The operating temperature and the electrolyte thickness are the most influential parameters on the power density; conversely, the cathode and anode thicknesses are the least influential parameters on the power density.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			1454-2331			WOS:000434271500014

The reaction mechanisms involved in the thermal transformation of two different MOF precursors obtained by using fumaric (H2FUM) and terephthalic (H2BDC) acid as linkers were investigated. The transformation of these two precursors, characterized by two different C/Zr ratio proceeds through an intermediate zirconia phase formed during heating, in association with turbostratic carbon. The zirconia is shown to nucleate within carbon areas coming from the decomposition of the precursors. Zirconia is mainly observed under its tetragonal form in the Zr-BDC carbon rich system (C/Zr = 8) while the monoclinic form predominates in the Zr-FUM low carbon system (C/Zr = 4). The transformation then finally appears very similar to the classical carbothermal reaction between zirconia and carbon black. The reconstructive transformation of zirconia into an oxycarbide phase being highly energy consuming, high temperature heat treatment are required precluding the possibility to obtain the expected nanocrystalline oxycarbide phase by such a way of synthesis. Coupled XRD and TEM study reveals that Zr-BDC system is considered as carbon saturated and the Zr-FUM system appears as carbon deficient. In the Zr-BDC system, zirconia first disappears during the thermal reaction and the oxygen rich oxycarbide that is first formed then reacts with residual carbon to provide progressive carbon enrichment until the saturation of the ZrCxOy oxycarbide solid solution. On the opposite, in the Zr-FUM system, the carbon is the rate-limiting factor of the reaction and the residual zirconia is shown to react with the oxycarbide earlier formed, suggesting the occurrence of a peritectoid like transformation.

Clinically, AD is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by a global cognitive decline. Accumulating evidence indicates that reactive oxygen species-mediated reactions, particularly of neuronal lipids, are extensive in those AD brain areas directly involved in the disease processes. Traditional views claim that oxidative-mediated tissue injury in the AD brain is the result of neurodegeneration. In recent years, numerous investigations have pointed to the functional importance of oxidative imbalance as a crucial event in mediating AD pathogenesis. The availability of specific and sensitive markers to monitor in vivo oxidative stress, in combination with studies performed in living patients with clinical diagnosis of AD are helping us to elucidate these issues. The evidence we have accumulated so far clearly indicates that oxidative imbalance and subsequent oxidative stress are early events during the evolution of the disease. and secondary to specific mechanism(s) present in AD but not in other neurodegenerative diseases. These new concepts implicate that this phenomenon may play a more important role in AD pathogenesis than previously anticipated, and that any therapeutic intervention targeting oxidative stress should be initiated at the earliest possible stage of the disease.									176	3	0	0	144	1	178			1387-2877	1875-8908		WOS:000224498100009	15096701

However, the rapid recombination of photogenerated electron-hole pairs deeply restricts photocatalytic activity of catalysts. Here, the in-situ transient photovoltage (TPV) technique was developed to investigate the interfacial photogenerated carrier extraction, photogenerated carrier recombination and the interfacial electron delivery kinetics of the photocatalyst. The carbon dots/NiCo2O4 (CDs/NiCo2O4) composite shows weakened recombination rate of photogenerated carriers due to charge storage of CDs, which enhances the photocatalytic water decomposition activity without any scavenger. CDs can accelerate the interface electron extraction about 0.09 ms, while the maximum electron storage time by CDs is up to 0.7 ms. The optimal CDs/NiCo2O4 composite (5 wt.% CDs) displays the hydrogen production of 62 mu mol.h(-1).g(-1) and oxygen production of 29 mu mol.h(-1).g(-1) at normal atmosphere, which is about 4 times greater than that of pristine NiCo2O4. This work provides sufficient evidence on the charge storage of CDs and the interfacial charge kinetics of photocatalysts on the basis of in-situ TPV tests.									18	1	0	0	0	0	18			1998-0124	1998-0000		WOS:000686417300004

A concept of realizing the caged-wrapping and sustained-releasing function of polymer as regard to high-activity chemical inhibitor was proposed, basing on which the composite inhibitor was prepared with poly(acrylic acid)/sodium alginate super absorbent and (+)-catechin. Subsequently, synchronous thermal analysis was carried out to investigate the influence of inhibitors on the tendency of coal to spontaneous combustion, Which was characterized by four characteristic temperatures and three other characteristic parameters marked. Furthermore, hot-surface ignition tests were conducted to validate the inhibition on coal ignition behavior. Finally, non-isothermal isoconversional methods were performed by Starink model and Friedman-Reich-Levi model, respectively. The results demonstrate that PAA/SA-CC synergizes the inhibiting characteristics of the two distinctive inhibitors, especially exerts a continuously high-efficiency inhibition on the coal-oxygen chemisorption, Which performs better than the case of mechanically blending. Besides, both the two kinetic analysis approaches agree on the results that the incorporation of 3 wt% PAA/SA-CC shifts the apparent activation energy-temperature evolution to higher levels.

In this study, a highly porous Cu2O catalyst was prepared by using combined surfactants of triblock copolymer P123 and n-butanol through a simple solution reduction method by ascorbic acid. Transmittance electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, and N-2 adsorption-desorption characterizations verify the highly porous structure with a relatively high surface area of 79.5 m(2)center dot g(-1) and a small crystallite size of 2.7 nm. The highly porous Cu2O shows 90% ozone conversion activity in harsh conditions, such as a high space velocity of 980,000 cm(3)center dot g(-1)center dot h(-1), or a high relative humidity of 90% etc., which is not only attributable to the high surface area but also to the high concentration of surface oxygen vacancy. The results show the promising prospect of the easily synthesized, highly porous Cu2O for effective ozone decomposition applications.									2	0	0	0	1	0	2				2073-4344		WOS:000653710100001

Highly active, selective, and robust electrocatalysts are strongly demanded to accelerate CO2 conversion and deploy this technology to practical applications. In this review, we focus on single-atom catalysts (SACs), a unique category of electrocatalysts with atomically dispersed metal active sites, which have shown distinctive performances in CO2R and offer an ideal platform for in-depth mechanistic studies at the atomic level. Despite various SACs with attractive CO2R performances have been reported, the relationship between electronic/geometric structure of SACs and the corresponding electrocatalytic performance still needs to be discussed with caution. Here we take a broad overview on the recent progress in understanding the structure-function correlation of SACs in CO2R, with the purpose of providing deep insights and guiding the future rational design of SACs. First, we provide the fundamental understandings of CO2R on SACs, following different reaction pathways. Then, we describe the progresses in the development of well-defined SACs and the mechanistic studies on the influences from particular structural parameters, such as first-shell and second-sphere coordination, conductive supports and interface with a secondary catalyst. Finally, some perspectives are highlighted on the path towards efficient CO2R on SACs.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1998-0124	1998-0000		WOS:000788936500002

In this context, novel nitrogen-doped graphene quantum dots (NGQDs) with high photoluminescence and upconversion emission have been synthesized as excellent light harvester. Subsequently, ordered hierarchical TiO2 nanowires were decorated with upconversion N-GQDs as a photoanode by a simple preparation method to improve the photocatalytic performance in the visible and near-infrared (NIR) regions of solar light, not otherwise absorbable by bare TiO2 nanostructures. Moreover, the enhancement of charge transfer efficiency and electron-hole separation according to the energy states of N-GQDs and TiO2 are considered for the improved photocatalytic performance of water splitting. N-GQDs/TiO2 shows superior photoelectrocatalytic (PEC) performance, achieving a photocurrent density of 3.0 mA.cm(-2) in 1.0 M KOH solution, which is eight times that of unmodified TiO2 at an applied voltage of 1.23 V vs. RHE. The high stability and photoelectrocatalytic activity of oxygen evolution reaction in the presence of newly synthesized N-GQDs are confirmed by chronoamperometry, open-circuit potential measurement, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. The as-fabricated photoanode provides an increased solar light harvesting from UV-Vis to NIR due to the application of newly synthesized upconversion GQDs, which increase energy conversion with an appealing perspective.

The reaction can be presented as consisting of 10 main steps separated by fold and cusp catastrophes. The description of the mechanism of C-O bond breaking is complicated and depends on the DFT method used. It proceeds through a heterolytic cleavage (B3LYP, M052x) with the formation of the V-3(O) non-bonding basin in step II (M052x) or with electron density resonating between oxygen and carbon atoms in step II (B3LYP). The C-C bond between the allyl group and the phenol ring is formed after the TS in step VIII. The reaction is terminated by the formation of two localized CQC bonds in the phenyl ring in steps IX and X. The localization of Vi=1,2(C,C) basins - typical of localized double bonds - in the phenyl ring proves the process of dearomatisation. The electronic structure of the transition structure distinguishes the non-bonding electron density concentrated in the vicinity of the C2 atom, represented by the V(C2) basin, with a population of 0.28e. This basin is a "bridgehead'' for the "construction'' of the C-C bond between the phenyl ring and the allyl group.									14	0	0	0	2	0	14			1144-0546	1369-9261		WOS:000384754300066

In this work, different metal oxides such as MnCo2O4, FeCo2O4, Co3O4, NiCo2O4, CuCo2O4, and ZnCo2O4, were synthesized using a hydrothermal method. The effects of metal ion substitution on the electrochemical properties of Co3O4 for energy storage applications were studied. The synthesized FeCo2O4 electrodes showed a maximum specific capacitance of 1319 F/g at 1 mV/s. Supercapacitor device was fabricated using FeCo2O4 electrodes, which showed improvement in energy storage capacity with an increase in temperature. An over 100% improvement in charge storage capacity was reached when the temperature increases from 10 to 60 degrees C. Furthermore, FeCo2O4 electrodes were studied as energy generation in oxygen evolution reaction (OER). These electrodes showed promising electrocatalytic activity with a low overpotential of 308 mV at 10 A/g.

The free carbon functions as electron trapping and the bridge of g-C3N4 and co-catalyst Pt, producing a high charge separation efficiency. The carbon content in the C/g-C3N4 hybrid nanosheets can be adjusted by changing ethanol content in the treating ambience.

It is an ideal way to develop high-performance electrocatalysts with enhanced activity and stability by combining the two compounds together. Herein, we present a new strategy to promote the sulfidation process of Ni nanoparticles by modifying with MoxC, which can increase the ratio of pyrrolic-N and pyridine-N. Interestingly, the increase of pyrrolic-N can further promote the metal Ni completely sulfurized into NiS2 nanoparticles. The as-synthesized material of NiS2 nanoparticles coated with self-grown carbon nanotubes modified by Mo2C can serve as bifunctional electrode, which achieves a current density of 10 mA cm(-)2 at a voltage of 1.52 V to generate H-2 and O-2 gases in alkaline media. Moreover, it can maintain 24 h stability at different current densities, which is more stable than N-CNTs/NiS2-Ni without Mo element. This finding provides a new method and idea for the development of new composite electrocatalysts toward more efficient water splitting.									51	2	0	0	2	0	51			0378-7753	1873-2755		WOS:000464485200014

It was found that the activity of the Au/Fe2O3 catalysts not only depends on the number of the gold atoms at the interfacial perimeter but also strongly depends on the geometrical structure of these gold atoms, which is determined by the size of the gold particle. Aberration-corrected scanning transmission electron microscopy images unambiguously suggested that the gold particles, transformed from a two-dimensional flat shape to a well-faceted truncated octahedron when the size slightly enlarged from 2.2 to 3.5 nm. Such a size-induced shape evolution altered the chemical bonding environments of the gold atoms at the interfacial perimeters and consequently their catalytic activity. For Au particles with a mean size of 2.2 nm, the interfacial perimeter gold atoms possessed a higher degree of unsaturated coordination environment while for Au particles with a mean size of 3.5 nm the perimeter gold atoms mainly followed the atomic arrangements of Au {111} and {100} facets. Kinetic study, with respect to the reaction rate and the turnover frequency on the interfacial perimeter gold atom, found that the low-coordinated perimeter gold atoms were intrinsically more active for CO oxidation.

The degradation of p-aminobenzoic acid (PABA) by peroxymonosulfate (PMS) along with the evolution of EfOM in the presence of Clwere assessed in this study. In PMS/Cl-/EfOM system, the degradation efficiency of PABA was enhanced with the increase of Clconcentration. Direct PMS oxidation made a major contribution to the degradation of PABA when Cldosage was lower than 50 mM. Hypochlorous acid/hypochlorite (HClO/ClO-) were identified to be the main reactive chlorine species (RCS) by experiments together with modelling results. Additionally, singlet oxygen (O-1(2)) also contributed to the decomposition of PABA. The pseudo-first-order rate constant (k') of direct PMS oxidation (k ' PMS) rose slightly with the increase of pH value (6.0-9.0). The k' of RCS (k '(RCS)) improved significantly with increasing Clconcentration, while k '(RCS) reduced upon increasing EfOM concentration due to the scavenging effect by EfOM. Comparatively, the contribution of k' of O-1(2) (k ' O-1(2)) witnessed a slight rise from 4.17% to 7.96% with the increase of Clconcentration. Furthermore, the removal efficiency of EfOM showed a marked increase as the Cl- dosage increased. Humic-like component of EfOM was most liable to decomposition, whereas tryptophan-like aromatic protein in EfOM was not amenable to degradation. This study provides useful insights for PABA degradation by PMS in the coexistence of Cland EfOM in the advanced treatment of wastewater.									6	1	0	0	2	0	6			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000624523300006

In this study, Ni/Al2O3 catalyst was modified with Fe, Zn, Cu or Co and the influences on formation of intermediate product and nature of coke was paid particular attention in steam reforming of acetic acid. The results indicated that iron or cobalt oxide reacted with NiO, forming NiFe2O4 and NiCo2O4, while copper or zinc oxide reacted with alumina, forming Al2CuO4 and ZnAl2O4, respectively. This weakened interaction between nickel oxide and alumina but also led to increase of nickel size, except Zn additive. Presence of Zn or Co in the catalyst enhanced adsorption of -OH or CO2, facilitating gasification of precursors of amorphous coke. The Cu additive intensifies adsorption/activation of oxygen-containing intermediates, while Fe was the opposite. The additive of Zn, Cu or Co, with exception of Fe, enhanced catalytic stability by suppressing formation of polymeric coke, although overall amount of coke was much higher. The coke formed in Zn, Cu or Co modified catalyst was mainly catalytic coke with a higher C/H ratio, higher crystallinity, higher thermal stability, higher portion of graphite structures, and nanotube-like structure of irregular inner cavity but with less impacts on catalytic stability.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0016-2361	1873-7153		WOS:000783213000003

However, the formation of well-defined junctions between low dimensional semiconductors and cocatalysts is still challenging. In this study, CdS nanorod photoanodes loaded with cobalt phosphate (CoPi) cocatalyst were synthesized by a facile two-step route, in which CdS nanorods were prepared using a hydrothermal method followed by photo-assisted electrodeposition of CoPi. It was found that the formation of intimate junctions between CoPi and CdS nanorods in the form of Co-S bonding effectively facilitated the charge separation and lowered the activation energy of the water oxidation reaction. This resulted in highly efficient and stable photoelectrochemical water splitting on the CdS photoanode. The optimal CdS/CoPi photoanode showed a maximum photocurrent of 4.7 mA/cm(2) at 0 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode under an AM 1.5 G solar simulator, which was 5.5-fold higher than that of bare CdS photoanode. This work expands the potential application of the cocatalyst CoPi in CdS photoanode systems and improves our understanding of the nature of cocatalysts with well-defined interface junctions in semiconductors. Graphic Well-defined interfacial junction with Co-S bonding over cobalt phosphate cocatalyzed CdS nanorod photoanode facilitates the charge separation and lowers the activation energy, thus achieving a considerable photocurrent of 4.7 mA/cm(2) at 0 V vs. RHE.[GRAPHICS].									5	1	0	0	0	0	5			1011-372X	1572-879X		WOS:000507784900002

The as-synthesized NiCo2O4 nanomaterial based anode exhibits an excellent catalytic activity towards glucose oxidation with a low oxidation potential of similar to 0.43 V (vs. Ag/AgCl), a high current density of similar to 26.2 mA cm(-2), a high mass activity of similar to 263.0 A g(-1) and a long term durability of over similar to 500 continuous cycles. The flower-like NiCo2O4 nanomaterial delivers an over similar to 1.4, similar to 1.9, and similar to 2.0 times higher catalytic current density with a less positive shift by similar to 70 mV, similar to 80 mV and similar to 40 mV, respectively, when compared to NiO, Co3O4, and commercial Pt/C. The enhanced catalytic activity of the as-developed Earth-abundant NiCo2O4 nanomaterial may be ascribed to its exclusive architecture with a less agglomerated structure, high electrochemically active surface area (ECASA), small pore size, mixed active sites of nickel and cobalt cations and favourable atmosphere for the enriched electron transfer process between analytes and electrodes. The present anode material is competent in performing direct electron transfer to the surface of the electrode and removes the requirement for enzymes and mediators.									17	2	0	0	0	0	18			1144-0546	1369-9261		WOS:000487373300012

Electrochemical CO2-to-CO Conversion Catalyzed by Iron Porphyrins								JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY C				120	51			28951	28960		10.1021/acs.jpcc.6b09947				DEC 29 2016	2016	Redox pairs of transition metal complexes are often involved in small molecule activation in response to modem energy challenges as well as in other areas of electrocatalysis. Within such a family of molecular electrocatalysts, ligand substitution is a means of varying catalytic efficiency, best gauged through catalytic Tafel plots relating overpotential and turnover frequency. In practice, efficient molecular catalysis involves multielectron-multistep processes. It is in this framework that we discuss through-structure inductive substituent effects. What the best choice is for the reference thermodynamic index, how the global substituent effect may be expressed as a function of this index, and how it may be dissected into individual effects assigned to each of the reaction steps are challenging questions that are addressed and resolved here for the first time. The discussion is illustrated by the effect of successive phenyl perfluoration and of o,o'-methoxy substitution of the Fe-I/0 tetraphenylporphyrin catalysts of the CO2-to-CO electrochemical conversion. Consequences on the relative position of the catalytic Tafel plots are also examined. This analysis of through-structure electronic effects is a necessary preliminary to of substituent through-space effects (electrostatic, H-bonding) because, albeit of different nature, they may occur simultaneously. Investigation of these two aspects of substituent effects and of the rules that emerge thereof pave the way to future imaginative design of catalysts for the CO2-to-CO-conversion and also for any other molecular catalytic reactions.									100	2	0	0	12	0	100			1932-7447	1932-7455		WOS:000391160400007

With the recent availability of nanocarbon catalysts, the application of carbon materials in catalysis has gained a renewed momentum. The research is concentrated on tailoring the surface chemistry of nanocarbon materials, since the pristine carbons in general are not active for heterogeneous catalysis. Surface functionalization, doping with heteroatoms, and creating defects are the most used strategies to make efficient catalysts. However, the nature of the catalytic active sites and their role in determining the activity and selectivity is still not well understood. Herein, the types of active sites reported for several mainstream nanocarbons, including carbon nanotubes, graphene-based materials, and 3D porous nanocarbons, are summarized. Knowledge about the active sites will be beneficial for the design and synthesis of nanocarbon catalysts with improved activity, selectivity, and stability.									69	9	0	0	2	0	72				2198-3844		WOS:000506006000001	32154069

In the present paper, we investigated the effects of Ce(3+), which has the most significant catalytic effects and similar characteristics with Ca(2+), on light energy conversion of spinach chloroplasts under Ca(2+)-deficient stress. The results illuminated that the Hill reaction activity, electron flow both photosystems and photophosphorylation rate of spinach chloroplasts reduced significantly under Ca(2+)-deficient condition, and activities of Mg(2+)-ATPase and Ca(2+)-ATPase on the thylakoid membrane were severely inhibited. Meanwhile, the activity of Rubisco, which is the key enzyme of photosynthetic carbon assimilation, was also prohibited. However, Ce(3+) decreased the inhibition of calcium deprivation the electron transport rate, the oxygen evolution rate, the cyclic and noncyclic photophosphorylation, the activities of Mg(2+)-ATPase, Ca(2+)-ATPase and Rubisco of spinach chloroplasts. All above implied that Ca(2+)-depletion could disturb light energy conversion of chloroplasts strongly, which could be reversed by Ce(3+).									18	7	0	0	14	0	24			0966-0844			WOS:000258897100005	18404405

Applications in the energy sector are of particular importance, with the pressing need to decarbonize our economy and to live more sus-tainably. For a material to be optimal for an application we typically tailor their specific properties and characteristics to best fit with the desired parameters. In the past, this has included the forging of metal alloys or the doping of semiconductors, allowing us to controllably adjust the material properties. For two-dimensional materials, one of the best routes for such controlled manipulation is via forming a heterostructure, or hybrid, with another nanomaterial. In this review, we will explore the emergence of 0D-2D hybrid materials, where a 2D layered material is combined with a zero-dimensional (0D) nano-particle or fullerene to adjust and enhance overall performance. We will cover the basics of their structure and modes of interaction, the different synthetic methods used for their assembly and prep-aration and review several energy applications in which promising results have already been achieved.

Although significant progress has been made in the synthesis of bimetallic nanodendrites, few works involve a systemconsisting of Pd and Cu, particularly in the case of alloyed nanodendrites. Here, we report a facile and powerful approach for the synthesis of PdCu alloy nanodendrites with tunable composition through varying the molar ratio of the Pd and Cu salt precursors. The key to achieving PdCu alloy nanodendrites is the use of W(CO)(6), which serves as a strong reducing agent. In addition, variation in the molar ratio of the precursors, from Pd rich to Cu rich, leads to shape evolution of the PdCu alloy, moving from a polyhedral to a dendritic nanostructure. This result indicates that galvanic replacement between a Cu rich alloy and a Pd precursor also plays an important role in the formation of PdCu alloy nanodendrites. When used as electrocatalysts for the methanol oxidation reaction (MOR), PdCu alloy nanodendrites exhibit remarkably enhanced catalytic properties relative to commercial Pd/C. Specifically, Pd35Cu65 alloy nanodendrites show the highest specific activity and mass activity for the MOR, 9.3 and 7.6 times higher than that of commercial Pd/C, respectively. This enhancement can be attributed to their dendritic structure and a possible bifunctional mechanism between Pd and Cu.									20	1	0	0	0	0	20			2046-2069			WOS:000393754100030

CaO and SrO) with Nd2O3. The concentration as well as the evolution of surface carbonate species with temperature, reflecting the basic properties of mixed oxides, was analyzed by TPD, XPS and IR methods to obtain information on the reaction mechanism. The concentration of surface basic sites contributing to the formation of C-2(+) was determined by measuring the amount of evolved CO2 in the 300-820 degrees C temperature range. The experimental data showed that the higher was the catalyst basicity the better was the efficiency for selectively converting methane to C-2(+). The turnover frequency (TOF) values were calculated by quantitatively determining the total number basic sites retaining CO2. The experimental results led to the idea that methane is converted to products on two types of active sites by independent pathways. The alkaline active sites are responsible for C-2(+) formation whereas the acidic sites with low affinity for carbonate formation are responsible for methane combustion. The synergetic effect between a selected alkaline-earth oxide (MgO) and a series of rare-oxide on the OCM catalytic activity has been also investigated. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Experiments were conducted at 300-1,220 mg L-1 initial chemical oxygen demand (COD) concentrations, 0.05-1.35 V versus SHE and 1.39-1.48 V versus SHE potential windows, 15-50 mA cm(-2) current densities, 0-20 mM NaCl, Na2SO4, or FeCl3 concentrations, 80 degrees C temperature, and acidic conditions. Partial and total oxidation reactions occur with the overall rate being near first-order kinetics with respect to COD. Oxidation at 28 Ah L-1 and 50 mA cm(-2) leads to quite high color and phenols removal (86 and 84%, respectively), elimination of ecotoxicity, and a satisfactory COD and total organic carbon reduction (52 and 38%, respectively). Similar performance can be achieved at the same charge (28 Ah L-1) using lower current densities (15 mA cm(-2)) but in the presence of various salts. For example, COD removal is less than 7% at 28 Ah L-1 in a salt-free sample, while addition of 20 mM NaCl results in 54% COD reduction. Decolorization of OMW using Ti/RuO2 anode seems to be independent of the presence of salts in contrast with Ti/IrO2 where addition of NaCl has a beneficial effect on decolorization.									69	5	0	0	29	1	74			0021-891X			WOS:000286141700002

However, developing such flexible power sources with high efficiency and durability remains a great challenge, largely due to the low effectiveness of the key components within the ZAB configuration. Herein, we demonstrate an efficient, flexible and rechargeable ZAB by integrating an active Co-N-C reversible electrocatalyst and a highly conductive alkalined polyacrylate hydrogel. The active sites for the oxygen reduction and evolution reactions (ORR-OER) within the catalyst are carefully identified and facily tuned, enabling the engineered catalyst to deliver much better bifunctional activities than the noble-metal counterparts yet with only approximately 7% cost of the latter. The alkalined hydrogel affords preeminent ionic conductivity and water retention capability, well satisfies the role for solid-state electrolyte. Impressively, the thus fabricated solid-state flexible ZAB exhibits an open circuit voltage of 1.45 V, a peak power density of 144.6 mWcm(-2), a round trip efficiency of 62%, a stable rechargebility for over 400 cycles at 2 mA cm(-2) along with excellent flexibility, which even outperform those from many aqueous ZABs, highlighting its great potential as flexible power source for next-generation electronics.									74	3	0	0	1	0	76			2405-8297			WOS:000472961700023

Here, we disclose that sulfur doping induces an obvious proton-feeding effect for CO2RR. The model SAC catalyst with sulfur doping in the second-shell of FeN4 (Fe-1-NSC) was verified by X-ray absorption spectroscopy and aberration-corrected scanning transmission electron microscopy. Fe-1-NSC exhibits superior CO2RR performance compared to sulfur-free FeN4 and most reported Fe-based SACs, with a maximum CO Faradaic efficiency of 98.6 % and turnover frequency of 1197 h(-1). Kinetic analysis and in situ characterizations confirm that sulfur doping accelerates H2O activation and feeds sufficient protons for promoting CO2 conversion to *COOH, which is also corroborated by the theoretical results. This work deepens the understanding of the CO2RR mechanism based on SAC catalysts.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			1433-7851	1521-3773		WOS:000817203800001	35674117	
J	Oku, Hirosuke; Mutanda, Ishmael; Fukuta, Masakazu; Inafuku, Masashi								Non-enzymatic formation of isoprene and 2-methyl-3-buten-2-ol (2-MBO) by manganese								SCIENTIFIC REPORTS				12	1					2465	10.1038/s41598-022-06520-0				FEB 14 2022	2022	It has been suggested that isoprene synthesis by isoprene synthase (IspS) proceeds via a substrate-assisted mechanism. The authors observed a non-enzymatic isoprene formation by Mn2+, which represents the basis of IspS enzyme reaction. Because IspS and many other terpene synthases require Mn2+ metal ions as cofactor, this study characterized the formation reaction for the first time. Metal ions including Mn2+ non-enzymatically produced both isoprene and 2-methyl-3-buten-2-ol (2-MBO) from dimethylallyl pyrophosphate (DMADP). Isoprene formation was most enhanced by Fe2+ and, to a lesser extent, by Mn2+ or Cu2+. Ni2+, Co2+, Mg2+, and Ba2+ exhibited a low activity to generate both isoprene and 2-MBO. The proportion of isoprene and 2-MBO varied with the Mn2+ concentration: isoprene predominated over 2-MBO at a higher Mn2+ concentration. Similarly, isoprene formation by Mn2+ increased exponentially as temperature increased with predominance of isoprene over 2-MBO at higher temperature. Both isoprene and 2-MBO formation was enhanced by acidic and neutral pH compared to alkaline conditions. Molecular dynamic simulation of DMADP suggested that the formation reaction is initiated by deprotonation of hydrogen on allyl terminal carbon by phosphate oxygen and generates carbocation and allyl anion intermediates. This is followed by quenching to produce isoprene or by hydroxyl addition to form 2-MBO. Thus, this study provided an insight into reaction mechanism of isoprene and 2-MBO biosynthesis and highlighted some parts of isoprene emission from terrestrial plants, which could be formed by non-enzymatic mechanism.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2045-2322			WOS:000755212600031	35165356

We characterize the special micromilieu of glauconitization developed during early diagenesis and present a model for glauconite formation in fecal pellets.Glauconitization at Oker (Central Germany) occurred predominantly in fecal pellets deposited in a shallow marine-lagoonal environment during the Kimmeridgian. Within the fecal pellets, rapid oxidation of organic matter provides the post-depositional, physicochemical conditions favourable for glauconitization. Replacements of matrix calcite, dissolution of detrital quartz, K-feldspar, and clay minerals, and Fe redox reactions were observed within the early micro-environment, followed by the precipitation of euhedral pyrite, matrix-replacive dolomite, and megaquartz accompanied by IS formation as thin section analyses and SEM observations show. Carbonate geochemical compositions based on ICP-OES and stable oxygen and carbon isotope signatures demonstrate that glauconite formation started in a suboxic environment at a pH of 7-8 and a temperature of 22 +/- 3 degrees C to 37 +/- 2 degrees C at maximum.TEM-EDX-SAED and XRD analyses on separated glauconite fecal pellets and on the <2 mu m clay mineral fraction reveal the predominance of authigenic 1M(d)-glauconite, 1M(d)-glauconite-smectite, and 1M(d) cis-vacant I-S, besides accessory detrital 2M(1)-illite and montmorillonite. Kinetic modelling of the glauconite (93-94% Fe-illite layers and 6-7% Fe-smectite layers, R3) and of I-S (66-68% Al-illite layers and 32-34% Al-smectite layers, RI) leads us to conclude that the I-S formed solely by slow burial diagenesis, whereas the glauconite formed close to the seafloor, suggesting significantly faster kinetics of the glauconitization reaction compared with smectite-illitization related to burial diagenesis. Thermodynamically, the substitution of octahedral Al3+ for Fe3+ and Mg2+ during the Fe-Mg-smectite to glauconite reaction via the formation of glauconite-smectite mixed-layered clay minerals may have resulted in a higher reaction rate for this low-temperature glauconitization process.									40	3	0	0	8	0	41			0009-8558	1471-8030		WOS:000312681700009

Single phases of KM(2)Nb(5)O(15) and K(2)LnNb(5)O(15) were successfully prepared by solid-state reaction (SSR) method and polymerizable complex (PC) method. The band gaps of these niobates were estimated to be 3.1-3.5 eV. These metal oxides loaded with an activated NiO(x) cocatalyst showed photocatalytic activities for water splitting into H(2) and O(2) under UV irradiation. When K(2)LaNb(5)O(15) was doped by Rh ions, a new visible-light absorption band was observed around 400-500 nm in addition to the band gap absorption band of the K(2)LaNb(5)O(15) host.

Mesoscopic pattern formation during initial oxidation of Ni(111) observed by electron emission microscopy								SURFACE SCIENCE				602	3			724	732		10.1016/j.susc.2007.12.003				FEB 1 2008	2008	An apparatus available for metastable-atom electron emission microscopy (MEEM) and photoelectron emission microscopy (PEEM) was constructed for the present study, based on our electron trajectory simulations. In MEEM, information on the local electronic states at the topmost layer is selectively obtained. The mesoscopic (mu m-scale) images during initial oxidation of Ni(111) at temperature of 300-700 K were monitored and compared with the spectroscopic data. The MEEM images obtained upon thermal collision of He*(2(3)S) are shaded in ascending order of brightness: the chemisorbed, clean, and oxidized surfaces. Their brightness is in good agreement with the emission yield estimated from the corresponding electron emission spectra. During nucleation and lateral growth of oxide at 300 K, the PEEM and MEEM images reveal dappled and sometimes periodic patterns, probably due to surface defects that lingered even after the surfaces were cleaned. The evolution of the images suggests that the initial oxidation proceeds via successive multinucleation. It is also found that the pin-scale patterns of oxide strongly depend on the substrate temperature and dose pressure of gaseous oxygen. The oxide formation in the mesoscopic scale is discussed in terms of a diffusion-reaction field. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V.

The nature of the thin films fabricated by ablation is dependent on the ablation rate, exposure time, oxygen partial pressure, and temperature. The influence of chemical and morphological features of thin films can be fruitfully engaged for various applications. In this work, using the pulsed laser deposition (PLD) method, the 2H-MoS2 target was laser-ablated, forming thin films of 1T-MoS2. A time-dependent study was carried out by keeping the 2H-MoS2 in the target carousal, and the laser was ablated for 5, 15, 30, and 45 min. For 5 and 15 min of laser ablation, the prominent phase was 2H-MoS2, whereas, for 30 and 45 min, 1T-MoS(2 )was the stable phase. The as-formed MoS2 thin films at 5, 15, 30, and 45 min were studied for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in 0.5 M H2SO4 for the first time, and they showed impressive results with low loading. As 1T-MoS 2 (30, 45 min) with both edge and basal planes are active for HER, they showed prominent activities compared to 2H-MoS2 (5, 15 min). The 1T-MoS2 phase prepared at 30 and 45 min showed overpotentials of 152 and 156 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) with Tafel slopes of 59 and 89 mV/dec, respectively. This new time-dependent study on MoS2 thin films for HER can be beneficial for making stable 1T-MoS2, which proved quite stable compared to other methods. A minimum deviation in overpotential was observed after PSTAT analysis. The lattice was heavily distorted by the harsh cathodization, and the lattice was expanded due to intercalation and deintercalation of the H+ ion, creating a lattice strain in the sample, which enhanced the activity by keeping the IT phase stable. From TEM results, a 16% increase in lattice expansion along (1 (1) over bar1) and an similar to 14.5% expansion along (10 (2) over bar) were observed, as supported by XRD (shift to lower Braggs' angles). The activity of the film was still stable and it showed that there was no change in the phase throughout cycling; further aging study proved the stability of the IT phase.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			2168-0485			WOS:000717346600011

The material was characterized by scaning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), Raman spectroscopy, physical adsorption, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). It was found that the as-prepared CANG features a robust three-dimensional hierarchically porous structure. The contents of Co and Al can achieve the maximum value of 2.18 at% and 0.51 at% at the annealing temperature of 950 degrees C. Upon using the electrocatalyst for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), the CANG exhibited remarkable electrocatalytic performance in both acidic (eta(10) = 105 mV) and alkaline media (eta(10) = 270 mV), and outperforms Co,N-codoped graphene and Al,N-codoped graphene, respectively. In combination with the density functional theory (DFT) calculations, it was revealed that the introduction of the Al heteroatom can decrease the absolute value of hydrogen adsorption free energy (Delta G(H*)) of Co-N-C catalysts, thus greatly enhancing the HER activity. This discovery will provide new guidance to the design of advanced and inexpensive carbon materials for fuel cell, water-splitting and other electrochemical devices.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3				2046-2069		WOS:000496137600055	35528912

To overcome this limitation, it is essential to understand the four proton-coupled electron transfer (PCET) steps in the reaction mechanism and their implications to the overpotential. Herein, a simple scheme to compute the energies of the PCET steps in water oxidation on the aqueous TiO2 surface using a hybrid density functional is described. An energy level diagram for fully decoupled electron-and proton-transfer reactions in which both electronic and protonic levels are placed on the same potential scale is also described. The level diagram helps to visualize the electronic and protonic components of the overpotential, and points out what are needed to improve. For TiO2, it is found that its catalytic activity is due to aligning the protonic energy levels in the PCET steps, while improving the activity requires also aligning the electronic levels.									63	2	0	0	8	0	65			1433-7851	1521-3773		WOS:000344052000004	25056713

Here, a prototype pristine rational design of all-solid-state coupled confronting Z-scheme (CCZ) system is synthesized by coprecipitation and hydrothermal method. This proof of concept comprises BiVO4 (B) and MgAl layered double hydroxide (L) as photosystem II (PS-II) whereas CdS quantum dots (QDs, C) as photosystem I (PS-I). CdS QDs trigger H-2 production that subsequently boosts O-2 production at PS-II. Furthermore, this rare CCZ system shows tremendous performance in methyl orange (MO) and tetracycline (TC) degradation. The prepared Z-scheme photocatalysts are capable of generating 17 350 and 33 000 mu mol h(-1) g(-1) of O-2 and H-2 under UV light irradiation, which correspond to apparent conversion efficiency of 7.22% and 13.73%, respectively. The catalyst is able to degrade, respectively, 92% and 51% of 20 mg L-1 TC and MO in 1 h. Maximum accessibility of charge carriers at final charge-separated state appears to be the basic cause in driving the photocatalytic activity efficiently. In spite of their various morphologies, synergistic interaction among C, B, and L can be effectively utilized to trigger various photocatalytic reactions.									24	1	0	0	0	0	24			2196-7350			WOS:000477191400001

The results indicate that both the oxidation state of Pt in the salt and the pH value of the aqueous solution comprising the platinum salt and formic acid are critical factors for the formation of Pt nanowires. Nanowires are obtained from platinum atoms in a +IV oxidation state, with ligating chloride anions (H2PtCl6 and K2PtCl6) or nonligating chloride anions (PtCl4). Increasing the pH of the aqueous Pt salt and HCOOH solution leads to a drastic reduction of the nanowires' length between pH 3 and 4.5. A mechanism involving formate as a reducing agent and formic acid as a structure directing agent explains these results. The Pt nanowires are stable up to 200 degrees C; therefore, these nanowires are suitable for use as catalysts in proton-exchange-membrane fuel cell. The optimized synthesis conditions are then selected for investigating the kinetics of the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) of such nanowires in a fuel cell. The ORR mass activity of the Pt nanowires is 130 A g(-1) Pt at 0.9 V iR-free potential; significantly higher than that of two commercial Pt/C catalysts tested in the same conditions. The higher mass activity is explained based on a higher surface specific activity. Accelerated degradation tests indicate that Pt nanowires supported on carbon are as stable as Pt nanoparticles supported on carbon.									28	3	0	0	1	0	29			1613-6810	1613-6829		WOS:000357943000014	25682734

At low temperatures (<350 degrees C), the total conversion of CO on the W-Cu-Ce systems was two times larger than on binary Cu-Ce mixed oxides which are well known catalysts for the WGS. In addition and in contrast with Cu-Ce, W-Cu-Ce catalysts were stable and no signs of deactivation were found after 10 h of reaction time. The rationale for the excellent catalytic performance presented by the W-Cu-Ce ternary oxide was elucidated from the viewpoint of a complete structural (e.g. analysis of the long and short range order) and redox behavior characterization using in situ, time-resolved X-ray diffraction (XRD) as well as X-ray absorption (XAS), infrared (diffuse reflectance Fourier transform DRIFTS) and Raman spectroscopies. From a single phase fluorite-type structure, the catalysts show significant structure/redox evolution under reaction conditions as a function of the W and Cu content. As it occurs in the parent Cu-Ce system, the dominant presence of metallic Cu and fluorite-type oxide phases is detected under reaction conditions for the ternary systems. An outstanding promotion of catalytic properties is nevertheless evidenced for samples with W content above 10 at.% and is shown to be related to the presence of oxidized W-Cu local entities. Such local entities, which are obviously characteristic of the ternary system, greatly enhance fluorite redox properties and play an interfacial role between the main metallic Cu and fluorite-type oxide phases. As a consequence of all these effects, incorporation of W into the initial material leads to efficient WGS catalysts, most promising for their application in the so-called low temperature region, e.g. below 350 degrees C.

Under all conditions studied, the concentration decay of pmp during electrooxidation follows first-order reaction kinetics. Through analysis of rotating ring-disc currents, the faradaic efficiencies for oxidation at various concentrations of pmp in solution were determined. Using u.v.-vis. and (HRMN)-R-1 spectroscopy for solution analysis, it is shown that partial oxidation of pmp occurs in chloride-free aqueous solutions. The principal products were p-benzoquinone and maleic acid, with low production of CO2 up to 1000 C dm(-3) charge. Mineralization to CO2 was considerably improved upon addition of chloride ions to the solution. In situ FTIR spectra of the electrode surface during electrolysis indicated that the presence of chloride ions enhances the mineralization of pmp by reaction of benzoquinone with anodically generated hypochlorite.									24	2	0	0	4	2	25			0021-891X			WOS:000220450700003		
J	DeBerry, D								Chemical evolution of liquid redox processes								ENVIRONMENTAL PROGRESS				16	3			193	199		10.1002/ep.3300160316				FAL 1997	1997	A multitude of processes have been proposed for removal of hydrogen sulfide from gaseous streams. Removal of H2S from sour natural gas streams is particularly difficult since low outlet concentrations must be reached before the gas is put into a pipeline Liquid redox sulfur recovery (LRSR) processes use a solution containing an oxidizing agent that absorbs H2S from the gas stream and oxidizes it to sulfur. The chemistry of these processes has undergone considerable evolution in the last 30 years.A number of tradeoffs must be considered in designing LRSR processes. For example, the rate of reaction of the oxidized agent with H2S often determines the scrubbing efficiency, but excessive rates of sulfur formation in the scrubber can lead to plugging. Systems based on vanadium and/or anthraquinone disulfonates (ADA) as the redox catalyst had several drawbacks, most of which can be traced to sluggish redox agent kinetics. Current LRSR processes use chelated iron as the catalyst for sulfur recovery. This gives faster scrubbing and reoxidation kinetics, but chemical degradation of the chelating agent can affect the economics of the process. Plugging of sorption vessels continues to be a problem in some applications. New nonaqueous solvent-based or biological processes may overcome these problems.									20	1	0	0	6	0	21			0278-4491			WOS:000073593800019

The effect of the gradual substitution of Sb by Ru in the nominal composition on the physicochemical and electrochemical properties were evaluated. The electrochemical stability of the electrodes was estimated from accelerated tests at 0.5 A cm(-2) in 1 M NaOH. Both as-synthesized and deactivated electrodes were thoroughly characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy-dispersive X-ray microanalysis (EDX), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and X-ray diffraction analysis (XRD). The incorporation of a small amount (about 3 at. %) of both Pt and Ru into the SnO2-Sb electrodes produced a 400-times increase in their service life in alkaline medium, with no remarkable change in the electrocatalysis of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). It is concluded that the deactivation of the electrodes is promoted by alkaline dissolution of metal species and coating detachment at high potentials. The introduction of Pt has a coating compacting effect, and Ru(IV), at low amounts until 9.75 at. %, replaces the Sn(IV) cations in the rutile-like SnO2 structure to form a solid solution that strongly increases the stability of the electrodes. The observed Ru segregation and decreased stability for larger Ru contents (x > 9.75 at. %), together with the selective dissolution of Ru after deactivation, suggest that the formation of a homogeneous (Ru delta Sn1-delta)O-2 single-phase is crucial for the stabilization of these electrodes.									58	1	0	0	11	0	59			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000347139400124	25453898

However, the heavier mass and larger radius of Na+ inevitably result in lower electrochemical kinetics and larger volume expansion of active materials than that of lighter and smaller Li+. To solve these problems, rational electrode design by integrating nanomaterials with graphene is an effective approach. In this review, the authors mainly focus on recent progress of graphene-based nanomaterials for SIBs, including their design principle, preparation, characterization, and electrochemical performance. The important roles of graphene in graphene-based inorganic and organic electrode materials are discussed in depth. In such composites, graphene can effectively enhance the electrical conductivity and mitigate volume change due to the robust and highly conductive networks formed by graphene. Moreover, the nanosized materials can enhance the reaction kinetics. Future research should focus on revealing the interaction mechanism between graphene and active materials, and improving the whole energy/power density, cycling stability, and the initial Coulombic efficiency of graphene-based nanomaterials via elaborate design.									137	6	0	0	1	0	139			1614-6832	1614-6840		WOS:000435258700001		
J	Chenglie Ma; Barry, B.A.								Electron paramagnetic resonance characterization of tyrosine radical, M+, in site directed mutants of photosystem II								Biophysical Journal				71	4			1961	72						Oct. 1996	1996	Photosystem II contains two well-characterized tyrosine radicals, D. and Z..Z is an electron carrier between the primary chlorophyll donor and the manganese catalytic site and is essential for enzymatic function. On the other hand. D forms a stable radical with no known role in oxygen evolution. D. and Z. give rise to similar, but not identical, room temperature electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) signals, which can be distinguished by their decay kinetics. A third room temperature EPR signal has also been observed in site-directed mutants in which a nonredox active amino acid is substituted at the D or Z site. This four-line EPR signal has been shown to have a tyrosine origin by isotopic labeling (Boerner and Barry, 1994, J. Biol. Chem. 269, 134-7), but such an EPR signal has never before been observed from a tyrosyl radical. The radical giving rise to this third unique signal has been named M+. Here we provide kinetic evidence that this signal arises from a third redox active tyrosine, distinct from tyrosine D and Z, in the photosystem II reaction center. Isotopic labeling and EPR spectroscopy provide evidence that M is a covalently modified tyrosine.									0	0	0		0	0	0			0006-3495			INSPEC:5491479

Janik, Michael/AAE-7213-2019				pH and Alkali Cation Effects on the Pt Cyclic Voltammogram Explained Using Density Functional Theory								JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY C				120	1			457	471		10.1021/acs.jpcc.5b10979				JAN 14 2016	2016	Platinum electrode cyclic voltammograms show features at low potentials which correspond to adsorption/desorption processes on Pt(111), Pt(100), and Pt(110) facets that have traditionally been ascribed to hydrogen adsorption. The 100 and 110 associated features exhibit a dependence on pH beyond the expected Nernstian shift. Herein we use density functional theory (DFT) to explain these shifts. We examine the specific adsorption of hydrogen, hydroxide, water, and potassium onto the low index facets of platinum, Pt(111), Pt(100), and Pt(110). In support of a growing body of evidence, we show that the low potential features which correspond to adsorption/desorption on Pt(100) and Pt(110) contain contributions from the competitive or coadsorption of hydroxide. This allows us to simulate cyclic voltammograms for Pt(100) and Pt(110), as well as Pt(111), which match experimentally measured cyclic voltammograms in a pH = 0 electrolyte. Furthermore, we find that potassium cations can specifically adsorb to all three low index facets of platinum, weakening the binding of hydroxide. As potassium-specific adsorption becomes more favorable with increasing pH, this allows us to explain the measured pH dependence of these features and to simulate cyclic voltammograms for the three low index facets of platinum which match experiment in a pH = 14 electrolyte. This has significant implications in catalysis for hydrogen oxidation/evolution, as well as for any electrocatalytic reaction which involves adsorbed hydroxide.									114	2	0	0	5	0	114			1932-7447	1932-7455		WOS:000368562200056

However, a large room for improving their activity and durability remains. Herein, we construct atomically dispersed Fe sites in N-doped carbon supports by secondary-atom-doped strategy. Upon the secondary doping, the density and coordination environment of active sites can be efficiently tuned, enabling the simultaneous improvement in the number and reactivity of the active site. Besides, structure optimizations in terms of the enlarged surface area and improved hydrophilicity can be achieved simultaneously. Due to the beneficial microstructure and abundant highly active FeN(5)moieties resulting from the secondary doping, the resultant catalyst exhibits an admirable half-wave potential of 0.81 V versus 0.83 V for Pt/C and much better stability than Pt/C in acidic media. This work would offer a general strategy for the design and preparation of highly active SACs for electrochemical energy devices.									68	6	0	0	3	0	69			2311-6706	2150-5551		WOS:000562862200002	34138162

Performances of NiFe-MgAl bifunctional catalysts, in terms of activity, stability, and regenerability, in chemical looping reforming (CLR) of ethanol were studied. The NiFe-MgAl bifunctional catalysts were prepared from hydrotalcite-like compounds by the co-precipitation method. Various characterization techniques, that is, X-ray diffraction, inductively coupled plasma, nitrogen adsorption/desorption, H-2-temperature-programmed reduction, and transmission electron microscopy, were used to determine properties of fresh and spent catalysts. In addition, O-2 temperature-programmed oxidation, scanning electron microscopy, and Raman analyses were used for observation of coke formation on the spent catalysts. Meanwhile, in situ diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy can verify the evolution of the catalyst during the reactions. It was observed that the NiFe-MgAl catalyst showed higher catalytic activity and stability than the monometallic Fe-MgAl and Ni-MgAl catalysts. More specifically, the NiFe-MgAl catalyst provided the highest H-2 concentration up to 80% at a low reaction temperature of 500 degrees C. This high performance was ascribed to the formation of Ni-Fe alloy particles. The combination of pulse experiments and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analysis elucidated that the iron particle at the surface was in the form of FeO that can oxidize the carbon deposits, resulting in the suppression of coke formation. In addition, the NiFe-MgAl catalyst can maintain high hydrogen selectivity for 10 repeated cycles.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			0887-0624	1520-5029		WOS:000674859500048

The goal is to deposit the majority of metal dissolved in the electrolytic bath during a reasonable time (no longer than several hours) providing an acceptable quality of the deposits in terms of purity, surface roughness, compact and crack-free structure and mechanical stability. The electrodeposition is carried out from novel aqueous baths prepared by dissolution of a metal powder in a HNO3-free solution due to the limited availability of isotopically enriched nickel concentration of the metal in the bath is low or moderate. This factor combined with the requirement of deposition of all dissolved metal makes serious differences between the target deposition and regular industrial plating. The impact of the electrolytic bath pH and the plating current density is analysed in order to optimise deposition parameters. The pH was varied from 3.8 to 5.3 while the applied current density ranged from 30 to 240 mA cm(-2). Progress in the deposition process was analysed using in situ UV-vis spectroscopy while a scanning electron microscope was applied to study the morphology of the deposits. Optimal electroplating conditions, which allow relatively fast deposition (up to ca. 7.2 h) of good quality metallic deposits containing most of the metal present in the bath (>= 95%), are suggested.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1432-8488	1433-0768		WOS:000812104100002

Nevertheless, irreversible phase transitions, structural instability, and moisture sensitivity place obstacles in their way to approach higher performance. Aiming at tackling these challenging issues, an in-depth understanding of the structural evolutions, morphology changes, composition and valence variations, as well as the electrode/electrolyte interface reactions upon battery cycling is of vital importance. Current state-of-the-art characterization techniques can gain valuable insights into the elusive reaction mechanisms, yield an overall picture of the battery configurations, and provide a guideline for the design of new electrode materials. Herein, the latest progresses on the applications of advanced analytical techniques to probe the Na-storage layered oxide cathodes are comprehensively summarized. In-situ or operando techniques are highlighted in this review to directly link the real-time structure, morphology, composition information with the electrochemical response, and the electrochemical measurements are also mentioned in selected examples. Special attention is paid to the detection principle of each technique and what valuable information can be obtained. Finally, the future developments of layered oxides towards highperformance SIB cathode materials with the help of advanced diagnostic methods are well prospected.									20	1	0	0	1	0	19			2405-8297			WOS:000621388200008

Here we prepared one advanced Pd/MnO2-Ni foam electrode via the construction of oxygen-deficient MnO2 nanosheet arrays on Ni foam skeleton, which then served as the support and electron donator to capture and reduce Pd precursor to nanoparticles. With the threedimensional porous structure, hierarchical skeleton surfaces and improved Pd dispersion, the Pd/MnO2-Ni foam electrode delivered an unprecedented large mass activity (k obs ) of 0.883 min(-1) mmolp d(-1) for EHDC of 2,4-dichlorophenol (2,4-DCP), in comparison to 0.081 min(-1) mmolp d(-1) of the Pd/Ni foam electrode and those reported in literatures. The Pd/MnO2-Ni foam electrode also displayed high durability during the repeated batch EHDC experiments without the efficiency decay and the leaching of Mn/Ni/Pd, unless some reduced sulfur compounds and nitrite were included. The mechanism study revealed the MnO2 in electrode served as a mediator to transfer H* from Pd to 2,4-DCP, which extended the reactive area beyond Pd and hindered the molecular hydrogen evolution, leading to the enhanced reactions between H* and 2,4-DCP. The Pd/MnO2-Ni foam electrode was also tested in a continuous-flow EHDC system, and displayed the potential and retention time-dependent performances.									14	2	0	0	4	0	16			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000514827600059

Providing more (Sr0.6Bi0.305)(2)Bi2O7 (SBO) catalysts to function as active sites of TiO2, together with the ability to construct heterojunction structures, is highly desirable for photocatalytic hydrogen evolution and pollutant photodegradation. To achieve this goal, in this work, (Sr0.6Bi0.305)(2)Bi2O7/P25 (SBO/P25) binary heterojunction catalyst is formed in situ on the TiO2 surface by a simple one-step hydrothermal method. To evaluate the feasibility of SBO/P25 as a very efficient photocatalyst for degradation of MB and photocatalytic hydrogen evolution, a series of photocatalytic experimental studies were carried out. The experimental result indicated that the existence of heterojunction structure in the SBO/P25 nanocomposites improves the photocatalytic activity of P25. The photocatalytic performance of H-2 evolution from water splitting and MB degradation for an optimal SBO/P25 photocatalyst reached 3.18 mmol g(-1) h(-1) and 3.42 x 10(-2) min(-1), respectively, which were 7.40 and 5.26 times higher than those of pure P25, respectively. The significantly improved catalytic capability on SBO/P25 is mainly ascribed to the enhanced visible light absorption and charge transfer in comparison with P25. In addition, SBO/P25 composites have excellent stability and recyclability, showing great potential for application in wastewater treatment and photocatalytic hydrogen evolution.									15	0	0	0	0	0	15			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000618283400002

The as extruded and annealed samples were examined by means of SEM, TEM and X-ray analysis. Heavily refined matrix grains and particles of cerium oxides were observed in the as extruded material. Fine microstructure attained by mechanical alloying and high affinity of oxygen to aluminum-magnesium matrix results in promoted solid state reactions between the matrix and reinforcements at elevated temperatures. Consequently, Al4Ce intermetallic grains and Al/Mg oxides are formed in the result of CeO2 decomposition. Hot compression tests were performed at constant true strain rate of 5.10-3 s-1 within the temperature range of 293 - 823K. Highly refined structure of the material was found to result in high strength of the composite, particularly for samples tested at low and intermediate temperatures.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			1013-9826			INSPEC:16383831		
J	Leister, Dario								Enhancing the light reactions of photosynthesis: Strategies, controversies, and perspectives.								Molecular plant											10.1016/j.molp.2022.08.005				2022-Aug-22	2022	Photosynthesis is central to life on Earth, employing sunlight, water, and carbon dioxide to produce chemical energy and oxygen. It is generally accepted that boosting its efficiency offers one promising way to increase crop yields under agronomically realistic conditions. Since the components, structure, and regulatory mechanisms of the light reactions of photosynthesis are well understood, concepts for enhancing the process have been suggested and partially tested. These approaches vary in complexity, from targeting single components to comprehensive redesign of the whole process on the scales from single cells or tissues to whole canopies. Attempts to enhance light utilization per leaf, by decreasing pigmentation, increasing levels of photosynthetic proteins, prolonging the lifespan of the photosynthetic machinery, or massive reconfiguration of the photosynthetic machinery and the incorporation of nanomaterials, are discussed in this review first. Secondly, strategies intended to optimize the acclimation of photosynthesis to changes in the environment are presented, including redesigning mechanisms to dissipate excess excitation energy (e.g., non-photochemical quenching) or reduction power (e.g., flavodiiron proteins). Moreover, schemes for improving acclimation, inspired by natural or laboratory-induced adaptation, are introduced. However, all these endeavors are still in an early exploratory phase and/or have not resulted in the desired outcome, largely because photosynthesis is embedded within large networks of closely interacting cellular and metabolic processes, which can vary among species and even cultivars. This explains why integrated, systems-wide approaches are required to achieve the breakthroughs required for effectively increasing crop yields.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1				1752-9867		MEDLINE:35996755	35996755	
J	Tailby, Nicholas D.; Cherniak, Daniele J.; Watson, E. Bruce								Al diffusion in quartz								AMERICAN MINERALOGIST				103	6			839	847		10.2138/am-2018-5613				JUN 2018	2018	Aluminum diffusion in synthetic and natural quartz was characterized under anhydrous conditions at 1 atm and temperatures from 700 to 950 degrees C. Experiments were carried out on polished quartz slabs immersed in fine-grained powder of spodumene or K-feldspar. Diffusion profiles were measured using Nuclear Reaction Analysis (NRA) and yield the following Arrhenius parameters: Dal = 2.48 x 10(11) exp(-199 +/- 10 kJ/mol/RT)m(2)s(-1), where log D-0 = -10.6 +/- 0.55.The diffusivity of Al through the quartz lattice is sufficiently slow (e.g., akin to Ti) that diffusive modification or loss of Al in magmatic or metamorphic quartz is unlikely in all but the most extreme temperature-time conditions seen in natural systems. In other words, core to rim Al zonation produced during crystal fractionation from a granitoid, or metamorphic overgrowths on quartz during metamorphism, are likely to be preserved at the crystal scale but may show some diffusive relaxation at sub-micrometers to tens of micrometers in scale. The similar diffusivities of Al and Ti also suggest that diffusive modification of Al/Ti is highly unlikely to occur at all but the smallest length scales (e.g., sub-micrometers to tens of micrometers). These observations indicate that the two most abundant impurities in quartz (Al and Ti) are likely to record primary information regarding the crystallization conditions in most geological environments.									17	0	0	0	2	0	17			0003-004X	1945-3027		WOS:000435340700002

The experiments primarily consisted of dropping 2 g of Fe-C droplets(s) into a much larger slag bath and measuring the reduction rate by determining the rate of evolution of CO (g) resulting from the reduction of FeO in the slag by C in the droplet. The eff ect of adding a small quantity of transition metal oxide (TiO2 or Nb2O5) to the slag or bringing the slag surface and the Fe-C droplet in contact with an inert metallic conductor (Mo foil) were also studied. Flash X-ray images were taken periodically to study the droplet/slag interface behaviour during the reactions. It was found that the reaction stopped when the carbon level in the Fe-C droplet reached 2-3%, though thermodynamic calculations showed that the reaction should proceed to almost 0%C underbar. Analysis of the experimental results revealed that during the initial reduction period (%C underbar > 2-3), the rate controlling step was likely to be gas film diffusion and transport in the slag phase. While, at lower carbon levels (%C underbar < 2-3), an electrochemical transport barrier in the slag phase was the rate controlling step. It is postulated that, when the electrochemical potential gradient between the bulk slag and the Fe-C droplet interface decreases at lower carbon levels (%C < 2-3), the electrons do not have sufficient driving force to migrate through the slag phase and consequently this also slows the counter migration of oxygen ions from the slag bulk to the Fe-C droplet interface. This theory is supported by the fact that when the slag and the droplet were brought in contact with an inert metallic conductor (Mo foil) which is much less electronically resistive than the slag, the reaction proceeded to almost 0%C underbar. Further work needs to be done to find out the precise nature of the rate controlling mechanism at low carbon levels.									28	1	0	0	0	0	28			0301-9233			WOS:A1993LT09600007

A well-aligned TiO2 nanotubes was successfully prepared by using 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium tetrafluoroborate as the electrolyte. The surface structure of anodes were characterized by scanning electron microscope, X-ray diffraction and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy. During the electrochemical degradation experiments, the effects of different anodes, current density, initial pH value and concentration were discussed. The results showed that co-doped Ta2O5 coating is an effective method to improve the surface morphology and the electrochemical characterization of Ti/TiO2 NTs/PbO2. At the initial pH value of 3 and current density of 12 mA cm(-2), the removal rates of Acid Orange 7 and total organic carbon with Ti/TiO2 NTs/Ta2O5-PbO2 anode were almost 100% and 98.3%. Comparing with Ti/PbO2 anode at the same charge consumption (3 A h L-1), the instantaneous current efficiency of the Ti/TiO2 NTs/Ta2O5-PbO2 anode and Ti/TiO2 NTs/PbO2 anode increased by 40.0% and 27.1%, respectively. The highest rate of k(center dot OH) on Ti/TiO2 NTs/Ta2O5-PbO2 anode was 12.4 mu mol (L min)(-1). The organic dyes are oxidized into CO2 and H2O by center dot OH radical. The reaction process and mechanism during the electrochemical degradation were discussed.

Despite significant improvements in material preparation, opera-tional performance and durability for these applications remain impractical, mainly due to poor multilayer structures and component design. This paper reviews recent ideas on improving the assembly design for three types of PEM applications, focusing on aspects of configuration optimization of the membrane electrode assembly and microstructured anode/cathode materials. Well-designed interfaces in catalyst layers (CLs) and diffusion layers (DLs), and between multilayers, are critical for reducing contact resistance and enhancing water management. Modification of catalyst/ionomer interfaces, such as order -structured CLs and patterned PEM/CLs, can improve catalyst utilization and notably reduce loading. Combining multiple CLs and DLs with different porosity or hydrophobicity, or using metal-based DLs (metal fiber or foam) is also feasible. Another approach receiving much attentions is to improve the common plate-and-frame structure to a plate-less one. Eliminating bipolar plates with ridge grooves or integrating the flow field with DLs can improve the reaction, and reduce mass transfer and interface ohmic resistances. Stack compactness can also be enhanced. From the microstructure of materials to the macro-structure of assembly configurations, this review pointed out systematical guidance for further research to achieve well-designed PEM assemblies.(c) 2022 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC.

JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL PHYSICS				151	18					180901	10.1063/1.5124710				NOV 14 2019	2019	Semiconductor photoelectrochemistry is a fascinating field that deals with the chemistry and physics of photodriven reactions at solid/liquid interfaces. The interdisciplinary field attracts (electro)chemists, materials scientists, spectroscopists, and theorists to study fundamental and applied problems such as carrier dynamics at illuminated electrode/electrolyte interfaces and solar energy conversion to electricity or chemical fuels. In the pursuit of practical photoelectrochemical energy conversion systems, researchers are exploring inexpensive, solution-processed semiconductor nanomaterials as light absorbers. Harnessing the enormous potential of nanomaterials for energy conversion applications requires a fundamental understanding of charge carrier generation, separation, transport, and interfacial charge transfer at heterogeneous nanoscale interfaces. Our current understanding of these processes is derived mainly from ensemble-average measurements of nanoparticle electrodes that report on the average behavior of trillions of nanoparticles. Ensemble-average measurements conceal how nanoparticle heterogeneity (e.g., differences in particle size, shape, and surface structure) contributes to the overall photoelectrochemical response.

J	Rajesh, John Anthuvan; Lee, Young-Noon; Yun, Yong-Han; Vu Hong Vinh Quy; Kang, Soon-Hyung; Kim, Hyunsoo; Ahn, Kwang-Soon								Potentiostatic deposition of CoNi2Se4 nanostructures on nickel foam as efficient battery-type electrodes for supercapacitors								JOURNAL OF ELECTROANALYTICAL CHEMISTRY				850						113371	10.1016/j.jelechem.2019.113371				OCT 1 2019	2019	Bimetallic CoNi2Se4 nanostructures on nickel-foam substrates were fabricated by a potentiostatic deposition method by adjusting the deposition solution pH, and used as electrode materials in battery-type supercapacitors. The electrodeposition solution pH had an important role in the fabrication of the desirable CoNi2Se4 nanostructures. At a deposition solution p(H) of 2.0, the synthesized product contained CoNi2Se4 nanoparticles. In contrast, a partially converted flake-like morphology was obtained at p(H) = 2.5. The appropriate flake-like morphology was formed by increasing the deposition solution pH to 3.0. The robust flake-like structure facilitated the electron transport during redox reactions, providing an excellent electrochemical behavior in terms of specific capacity, rate capability, and cyclic stability. A battery-type supercapacitor based on the flake-like CoNi2Se4 structure exhibited a maximum specific capacity of 632.5 C g(-1) at a current density of 1 A g(-1) and excellent rate performance (capacity retention of 91%) in the range of 1 to 40 A g(-1). The material retained 83.31% of its initial capacity after 3000 cycles of charging/discharging at a current density of 40 A g(-1), which suggests a high long-term cycling stability. The excellent electrochemical performance of the CoNi2Se4 electrode material make it very promising for application in supercapacitors. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

A novel procedure predicting a possibility of direct formation of magnesium oxide during electrodeposition from the nitrate melt used is reported. XRD analysis of the obtained deposits showed the formation of magnesium oxide along with magnesium hydroxide. The electrodeposition of magnesium oxide/hydroxide commences in magnesium underpotential (UPD) and continues through the magnesium overpotential (OPD) region. Network of individual or intertwined very thin needles as well as those grouped in flower-like aggregates or honeycomb-like structures were formed in both magnesium UPD and OPD regions. Formation of the long needles was explained through theories of mechanisms of dendrite formation. Hydrogen evolution commences in the magnesium OPD region and increases with the applied overpotential. Holes observed in the deposit originated from the detached hydrogen bubbles. The number, shape and size of the hole strongly depended on both the applied cathodic potential and the hold time of electrodeposition. Magnesium oxides/hydroxides syntheses taking part simultaneously at various applied potentials are a result of reactions between magnesium cations and products of water and nitrate anions reduction processes. Chemical reactions responsible for direct formation of magnesium oxide observed are those of magnesium ions and oxygen ions, formed by nitrate reduction taking part in the close vicinity of the working electrode.

In this work, we developed a particular chemical activation process assisted by nitrogen/sulfur co-doping for the preparation of hierarchical porous carbon materials with high specific surface area, aiming at improving the energy density of supercapacitors. The as-obtained hierarchical porous carbon materials exhibited both high Brunauer-Emmett-Teller surface area of up to 3652 m(2) g(-1) for more ions adsorption and high porosity (2.61 cm(3) g(-1)) for rapid ion transport. Attributed to the synergistic effects of these two features, the porous carbon displays high gravimetric specific capacitance (324 F g(-1)) in KOH aqueous electrolyte with outstanding rate performance (73.3% capacitance retention at 100 A g(-1)). The symmetrical supercapacitor based on our hierarchical porous carbon displays a maximum specific energy of 9.76 Wh kg(-1) and 94.5% retention over 10000 cycles at 15 A g(-1). This synthesis strategy is facile, low-cost and industrialized, which provide a promising route to prepare the hierarchical porous carbon materials for energy storage and renewable delivery devices.

The grains obtained in Ni-P matrix have been tuned to obtain a uniform and homogenous coating by incorporating nano WO3 catalyst. The improved electrocatalytic activity was evidenced from the low overpotential, high exchange current density and improved double layer capacitance obtained from the Tafel polarization and EIS analysis of Ni-P-WO3 coating. The retention of catalytically active sites and surface homogeneity was evidenced from the intermittent potential scan and EIS spectra obtained after HER of Ni-P-WO3 coating. The tolerance performance under vigorous conditions provided an insight into the sustained catalytic activity and electrochemical stability of the internal layers of Ni-P-WO3 coating. The incorporation of nano WO3 catalyst into the Ni-P matrix has also improved the metallurgical characteristics of electroless Ni-P coatings. (C) 2016 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC.

NPG showed a clear reductive current in the presence of alpha-keto acid and NH2OH, and the electrolysis experiments confirmed the production of L-amino acid. A reductive voltammetric signal at the NPG electrode appeared at a more positive potential by 0.18-0.79 V, compared with those at the planar-gold electrode without anodization and other previously reported electrode systems, indicating the high activity of the prepared nanostructure for the electrochemical reaction. Maximum Faradaic efficiencies (FEs) of 74-93% in the reductive molecular conversion to amino acids of Ala, Asp, Glu, Gly, and Leu were obtained under the optimized conditions. The FE values were strongly dependent on the applied potential in the electrolysis, suggesting that the hydrogen evolution reaction at the electrode surface was more significant as the applied potential became more negative. The effect of potential at the NPG was lower than that at the planar-gold electrode. These results indicate that nanostructurization decreases the overpotential for the electrochemical reductive amination, resulting in high FE.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0				1422-0067		WOS:000694366200001	34502351

Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and high-resolution TEM analyses revealed that the growth at early stages of the synthesis was dominated by particle coalescence, followed by shape focusing via recrystallization and further growth via atomic addition. We also investigated the detailed surface structure of the nanobars using aberration-corrected scanning TEM and found that the exposed {100} surfaces contained several types of defects such as an adatom island, a vacancy pit, and atomic steps. Upon thermal annealing, the nanobars evolved into a more thermodynamically favored shape with enhanced truncation at the corners.									81	5	0	0	6	0	83			1998-0124	1998-0000		WOS:000275754900004

Reaction products were characterized via X-ray powder diffraction (XRDP), chemical analysis (elemental analysis and atomic absorption spectrophotometry), thermal analysis combined with evolved gasses mass spectrometry (TGA-MSEGA) and synchrotron-based X-ray absorption spectroscopy via extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) characterization. Sorption isotherms for Cd(II) in presence of different substrates, shows that Cd(II) uptake depends both on Cd(II) starting concentration and the nature of the substrate. Thermal decomposition of Cd-cysteine treated clay minerals evidences the evolution of H2O, H2S, NO2, SO2, and N2O3. These results are well consistent with XRDP data collected both at room and at increasing temperature and further stress the influence of the substrate, in particular cysteine, on the interlayer. EXAFS studies suggest that Cd(II) coordinates with oxygen atoms, to give monomer complexes or CdO molecules, either on the mineral surface and/or in the interlayer. For Cd-cysteine complexes EXAFS data agree with the existence of Cd-S clusters, thus suggesting a predominant role of the thiol group in the bonding of Cd with the amino acid. (C) 2006 Elsevier B.V.

For catalytic systems in which the O-O bond is formed via radical coupling of two metal oxyl subunits, self-assembly of mononuclear catalysts into vesicles or fibrous aggregates can be used to improve the interaction of two catalytic centers. Similarly, the catalytic subunits can be brought into spatial proximity by coordination chemistry, which allows the construction of highly efficient metallosupramolecular multinuclear structures. However, if the O-O bond is formed by the nucleophilic attack of water at a metal oxide species, the interaction of the catalytic center with substrate water molecules has to be improved. Here, by introducing tailored ligand systems, the second coordination sphere can be adjusted specifically to preorganize water for O-O bond formation whereas the implementation of proton accepting residues can be used to lower the activation barrier of crucial proton-coupled reaction steps. In a particularly outstanding example, both principles were combined in a multinuclear metallosupramolecular macrocycle.									23	1	0	0	3	0	23			1614-6832	1614-6840		WOS:000408246300009

The catalyst was prepared using the Pechini method, and subsequently characterized by XRD, SEM-EDS, EIS and CV. The microstructural analysis of Ti/SbRuZr shows the formation of RuO2 (P4(2)/mnm) and ZrO2 (P2/m) crystalline phases, with an average crystallite size about twice (61.2 nm) lower than Ti/RuO2 (109 nm). Additionally, SEM micrographs reveal that ZrO2 affects the morphological features of the deposited RuO2 layer, turning it into a more heterogeneous material. The electrode capacity was evaluated through the elimination of antibiotic activity (AA) of CIP, revealing that 83 and 45% of AA was removed using Ti/SbRuZr and Ti/RuO2, respectively at 0.19 A h L (1). According to CV analysis, the electrochemical mechanism for CIP degradation was found to proceed through active chlorine species (Cl-2-active) on Ti/SbRuZr. This facile kinetics occurring on the ternary catalyst resulted from a high charge transfer resistance for oxygen evolution reaction, as revealed by EIS analysis. HPLC, HPLC-MS, and density functional theory were employed to propose a reaction pathway for CIP degradation. Findings from this work stands out prospective applications of anodic electrochemical oxidation to efficiently eliminate CIP, and the associated proliferation of antibiotic resistant microorganisms in aqueous media.

However, the interaction between the clay minerals and the colloidal oxides affecting the stability and the strength of geotechnical materials remains poorly understood. In the present work, the interaction between the clay minerals and the colloidal oxides was investigated by reaction molecular dynamics simulations to explore the mechanical properties of illite-based materials. It was found that the metal atoms of the intercalated amorphous iron and aluminum oxides interact with oxygen atoms of the silica tetrahedron at the interface generating chemical bonds to enhance the strength of the illite-based materials considerably. The deformation and failure processes of the hybrid illite-based structures illustrated that the Al-O bonds were more favorable to the mechanical properties' improvement of the hybrid system compared with Fe-O bonds. Moreover, the anisotropy of illite was greatly improved with metal oxide intercalation. This study provides new insight into the mechanical properties' improvement of clay-based materials through metal oxides intercalation.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0				2079-4991		WOS:000774518600001	35335810

IR measurements performed ex situ and in situ reveal the chemical reactions which take place during annealing at the interface of silicon bonded wafers with thin native (Si/Si) or thick thermally grown interfacial oxide (Si-SiO2/Si). A comparative analysis of the IR response of the buried interface in low temperature silicon bonded wafers prepared using different surface activation treatments is presented. The evolution with annealing temperature of the chemical species at the interface is used to explain the bonding mechanism of Si wafers in the temperature range of 30-400degC. Very good bonding (~3000 mJ m-2) at 200degC was obtained between pairs of Si wafers covered with native and thermally grown oxide in the case when the wafers were treated by reactive ion etching oxygen plasma.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0268-1242			INSPEC:8870660

However, the kinetics of CO(2 )conversion into other chemicals remains a challenge due to its thermodynamic stability. Herein, P and S co-doped graphitic-carbon nitride (PSCN) catalyst was synthesized through one-step thermal condensation to improve its Lewis acidity and basicity and investigate carbon dioxide/glycerol (CO2/GLY) conversion. The catalytic GLY conversion at 210 C reached 60% and 85% using pristine g-C3N4(CN) and PSCN, respectively, with CO2 as a carbon feedstock and CH3CN as a dehydrating agent. Density-functional theory (DFT) calculations revealed that the efficient charge transfer resulting from P and S doping could increase the catalytic activity for CO2/GLY conversion by lowering the activation barrier. This is the first study to demonstrate the catalytic activity of the PSCN catalyst for the CO2/ GLY conversion and the computational work for the GLY carboxylation reaction. Moreover, the interaction site and adsorption energy were investigated for the adsorption of CO(2)and GLY on PSCN and CN to elucidate the reaction mechanism. Our results demonstrated that PSCN could serve as a superior catalyst and pave new light for CO2/GLY conversion.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0008-6223	1873-3891		WOS:000864523600003

This method was applied to study the electro-oxidation of methanol on nickel films deposited galvanostatically on gold. This analysis suggests a strong dependence of the NiOOH formation and methanol oxidation on the scan rate. According to the EVLS deconvolution, at high scan rates (> 100 mV s-1), the oxidation of Ni(OH)2 to NiOOH has a remarkable resemblance to a reaction that proceeds in an adsorbed state. Decreasing the scan rate results in qualitative changes of the particular currents, implying the occurrence of electrochemical processes that require a larger time scale (>0.5 s), like the formation of the water intercalated gamma-NiOOH. For the methanol electro-oxidation process, the main contribution comes from the kinetic current; however, increasing the scan rate reveals a parallel diffusional process related to the oxygen evolution.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1938-5862			INSPEC:20328807		
J	Huang, Jun; Chen, Shengli								Interplay between Covalent and Noncovalent Interactions in Electrocatalysis								JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY C				122	47			26910	26921		10.1021/acs.jpcc.8b07534				NOV 29 2018	2018	Electrocatalysis has been advanced to a point that understanding how noncovalent interactions interplay with covalent interactions becomes essential to precision design of efficient electrocatalysts. However, a conceptual framework for facilitating such understandings is yet missing; existing theories of electrocatalysis usually neglect noncovalent interactions. To fill in this gap, this study presents a refined theory of electrocatalysis by adding a noncovalent term that is self-consistently derived from a mean-field electrical double-layer (EDL) model into the model Hamiltonian, in addition to the electronic interaction term described by the Anderson-Newns model and the solvent term inspired by the Marcus theory. Applying the Green function technique allows us to portray the potential energy surface, to pinpoint multiple states along the reaction pathway and further to determine the reaction free energy and activation energies. Multifaceted interplay between covalent and noncovalent interactions is revealed. On the one hand, chemisorption-induced surface dipoles modify the work function and electrostatic properties of the metal, leading to nonmonotonicity in the surface charging relation and then the activation energy profile. As an immediate consequence, the sum of anodic and cathodic transfer coefficient is less than unity and the cathodic transfer coefficient can even be negative. On the other hand, EDL effects modulate covalent interactions, in return, via dictating the electrochemical potential of ions. The theory brings forth a new adsorption isotherm, which provides fundamental insights into the perplexing strong indirect adsorbate-adsorbate interactions, and furnishes a theoretical approach to analyze the electrosorption valency as well.									18	1	0	0	1	0	19			1932-7447			WOS:000451933400015

Among them, the preparation of Pt-based catalysts with high atom utilization efficiency can induce more active sites between the Pt atoms and participating molecules, resulting in improved mass activity. In addition, the combination of high atom utilization efficiency with well-controlled surface structure and composition could boost the mass activity for Pt-based catalysts. This review describes recent progress in the design and synthesis of Pt-based catalysts with high atom utilization efficiency and their enhanced catalytic performance in electrochemical catalytic reactions. The significance for the fabrication of nanostructures and single atom catalysts with high atom utilization will be presented in the introduction section. We discuss the synthetic strategies according to two routes: (1) the rational design of Pt nanostructures, including porous, nanowire, core-shell and hollow structures; and (2) preparation of Pt single atom catalysts and the stabilization of single atoms. Additionally, we discuss the superior electro-catalytic applications of Pt-based catalysts with high atom utilization efficiency. These recent advancements in rational design of Pt-based catalysts offer numerous cases for potential industrialized catalysts with high mass activity and reduced cost in the future.									277	25	0	0	11	0	278			1754-5692	1754-5706		WOS:000459741700002

Titanocene(III) triflate complexes are readily obtained by reaction of a titanocene source with Yb(OTf)(3). Subsequent reactions with water and with/without TEMPO as hydrogen scavenger are studied. The as-obtained titanocene(IV) compounds can be photoreduced to give titanocene(III) triflate complexes, which can undergo further hydrolysis to form a closed catalytic cycle of water splitting. No further degradation of the photoreduced species was observed because of the presence of the OTf group. The stability of the system was evaluated in an experiment with high concentrations of water and TEMPO. X-ray crystallography on all titanocene complexes, EPR and NMR spectroscopy, and DFT were used to support our observations.									14	0	0	0	1	0	14			0002-7863			WOS:000367636600032	26641723

A special attention has been paid to take into account the microstructure properties of the ionic, electronic and gas phases as well as the processes occurring therein.A commercial LSM-YSZ symmetrical cell has been tested at 700, 750 and 850 degrees C in air. Simulations have been carried out to interpret the experimental data. It is suggested that the kinetic of O-2 formation is controlled by a single charge transfer.A sensitivity analysis has been performed using the micro model to quantify the role of the microstructure in the electrode behaviour. Transport of oxygen ions in the functional layer has a strong impact on the cell response since it governs the delocalization of the electrochemical reactions. The density of TPB length is also a key parameter controlling the electrode efficiency. Evolutions of the microstructural parameters in operation have been associated to the degradation of the electrochemical performances. The decrease in TPB length due to Ni agglomeration has a moderate impact whereas the decrease in ionic conductivities of 8YSZ or LSFC could explain a large amount of the cell degradation.

Modern systems show that mat biogeochemistry is the outcome of concerted activities and intimate interactions between various microbial metabolisms. Emerging knowledge of the regulation of oxygenic and sulfide-driven anoxygenic photosynthesis by versatile cyanobacteria, and their interactions with sulfur-oxidizing bacteria and sulfate-reducing bacteria, highlights how ecological and geochemical processes can control O-2 production in cyanobacterial mats in unexpected ways. This review explores such biological controls on O-2 production. We argue that the intertwined effects of light availability, redox geochemistry, regulation and competition of microbial metabolisms, and biogeochemical feedbacks result in emergent properties of cyanobacterial mat communities that are all critical yet largely overlooked mechanisms to potentially explain the protracted nature of Earth's oxygenation.									21	0	0	0	20	0	21			0084-6597	1545-4495	978-0-8243-2046-1	WOS:000434381100006

This work characterizes the coke formed in reaction of a subbituminous coal tar at 300, 400, and 500 degrees C in 40 min in a semibatch system which allows natural evaporation of light fractions. The coke is categorized into two types, the one suspended in tetrahydrofuran (THF), coke-S, and the one deposited on the wall of tube reactor, coke-D. It is found that coke-D accounts for 70-85% of total coke. With increasing tar reaction temperature and time the quantity of coke increases from 1.0% to 16.3 wt % and the particle size of coke-S increases from a most probable size of approximately 0.1 to 700-800 um. This change is accompanied by reduction in alkyl side chains and heteroatoms (0, N, and 5), as well as the enrichment in the aromatic C-ar-C-ar bond, which lead to a decrease in H/C ratio from 0.9 to 0.6 and increase in aromaticity f(a) from 0.70 to 0.86. The carbon distribution in coke-S is similar to that in bituminous coals and is composed of 3-7 fused aromatic rings. The changes in coke-S also include increase in radical concentration and decreases in the radicals' g value and line width, indicating continued pyrolysis and condensation of the coke due to the removal of oxygen atoms and side chains on the aromatic structure. When compared with coke-S, coke-D formed under the same conditions is more condensed as indicated by higher radical concentration and lower g value and line width. The morphological change in coke-D includes transformation of small irregular particles to spherical-like particles and to coke film that crack in 30 min at 300 degrees C or 10 min at 500 degrees C.									7	2	0	0	0	0	8			0887-0624	1520-5029		WOS:000392553800045

Conventional desulfurization wastewater treatment methods, such as chemical precipitation, evaporation and crystallization, and emerging zero discharge technologies like flue evaporation technology, cannot only effectively solve the negative problems caused by high chlorine situation, but also limit its security application. Based on this, this paper proposes electrochlorination technology coupled with existing wastewater treatment methods to treat this wastewater. The current mechanism of electrochlorination technology and the research progress of electrode materials are summarized. Followed by the CER theory, factors affecting the economic and reliable operation of the electrolytic desulfurization wastewater process are analyzed, including the regulation of electrolysis conditions and the selection of process flow. The influence of chemical oxygen demand(CODcr), ammonia nitrogen, F-, Ca~(2+), Mg~(2+)and heavy metal ions in the wastewater of coal-fired power plants on electrolysis is also analyzed. Finally, the economic potential of this process compared with other zero-discharge desulfurization wastewater technologies is analyzed. It is believed that with the continuous improvement of the chlorine evolution reaction mechanism and the continuous improvement of the technical feasibility of electrolytic chlorine production technology, it also has a certain competitive advantage in terms of economy. However, how to reduce the tendency of plate fouling, the adverse effects of other ions on electrolysis, and how to effectively control the interface reaction, still need more attempts.			燃煤电厂末端废水中高浓度的氯离子是制约废水回用和全厂废水零排放的关键因素,传统的脱硫废水处理方法如化学沉淀法、蒸发结晶,以及新兴的零排放技术如烟道蒸发技术,都不能有效地解决高氯带来的负面问题,甚至因为氯含量过高使技术应用受到限制。基于此,提出电解制氯技术耦合已有的废水处理方法处理燃煤电厂末端废水,并总结了现阶段电催化析氯反应的机理及电极材料研究进展;从电解制氯原理角度剖析了影响电解脱硫废水工艺经济可靠运行的因素,包括宏观电解条件的调控,工艺流程的选择;并分析了燃煤电厂末端废水中的化学需氧量、氨氮、F-、硬度离子以及重金属离子对电解的影响;认为随着析氯反应机理的不断完善,电解制氯技术的技术可行性不断提高的同时,在经济方面也有一定竞争优势。但如何减缓极板结垢倾向,降低其他离子对电解的不利影响,以及优化界面反应过程等还需要开展多方面的研究。						0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1002-3364			CSCD:7156601

Life (Basel, Switzerland)				5	1			604	36		10.3390/life5010604				2015 Feb 27	2015	Ribonucleotide reduction is the only pathway for de novo synthesis of deoxyribonucleotides in extant organisms. This chemically demanding reaction, which proceeds via a carbon-centered free radical, is catalyzed by ribonucleotide reductase (RNR). The mechanism has been deemed unlikely to be catalyzed by a ribozyme, creating an enigma regarding how the building blocks for DNA were synthesized at the transition from RNA- to DNA-encoded genomes. While it is entirely possible that a different pathway was later replaced with the modern mechanism, here we explore the evolutionary and biochemical limits for an origin of the mechanism in the RNA + protein world and suggest a model for a prototypical ribonucleotide reductase (protoRNR). From the protoRNR evolved the ancestor to modern RNRs, the urRNR, which diversified into the modern three classes. Since the initial radical generation differs between the three modern classes, it is difficult to establish how it was generated in the urRNR. Here we suggest a model that is similar to the B12-dependent mechanism in modern class II RNRs.									49	0	0	0	43	0	50			2075-1729			MEDLINE:25734234	25734234

Herein we demonstrate the size dependence of perovskite-type BaNbO2N particles, responsive to intensive-visible-light up to 740 nm, on the PEC water splitting activity. The layered perovskite Ba5Nb4O15 particles in different sizes, as a starting oxide for synthesis of BaNbO2N, were synthesized by polymerized complex method, followed by calcination at different temperatures (1073, 1173, 1273, and 1373 K). The size of Ba5Nb4O15 particles was dependent on the calcination temperature so that low-temperature calcination led to smaller BaNbO2N particles. Although the different Ba5Nb4O15 particles experienced nitridation at 1123 K for 13 h, the sizes of the resulting BaNbO2N particles were nearly unchanged from those of the starting oxides. The sizes and Brunauer-Emmett-Teller surface areas of porous BaNbO2N particles largely influenced the PEC water splitting activity. As a result, photoelectrode employing the small BaNbO2N particles, prepared from the calcination at 1173 K, produced the highest photocurrent of 2.20 mA cm(-2) at 1.23 V-RHE during the sunlight-driven water splitting, showing the size dependence of oxynitride particles on photoactivity. Therefore, findings from this study support that the size reduction of oxynitride particles largely improved the PEC water splitting activity. (C) 2022 Elsevier Inc.

However, semiconductor along usually inactivates bacteria tardily due to the fierce competition between high recombination rate of photo-excited charge carriers and the capture of them on surface to catalyse reactions. In this study, we in situ hybridized a cost-effective co-catalyst (MoS2) on an earth-abundant semiconductor (g-C3N4 in nanosheets) based on similar nano-layered configuration. The spontaneously synthesized MoS2 nano-layers (5-8 layers) was dominant in 1 T-phase which was found serviceable for efficient charge separation possibly by extracting electrons from g-C3N4 nanosheets through the fully contacted interface and accelerated charge transfer in highly conductive metallic MoS2, meanwhile affording additional active sites both at edges and on basal plans relative to edge-active 2H MoS2. The optimized 1 T-rich MoS2/g-C3N4 nanocomposite impressively enlarged the photocurrent density by a factor of 5.5 compared to bare g-C3N4 and promoted the formation of H2O2 as the main ROS, thus leading to a better photocatalytic water disinfection performance than those of single component catalysts, 2H-rich counterpart and physical MoS2/g-C3N4 mixture. This strategy would potentially enlighten the construction of other effective co-catalysts as alternatives to the expensive noble metals in catalysing photo-activated reactions.									71	6	0	0	9	0	74			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000521513300095

Native PSII is a supercomplex consisting of core and light-harvesting chlorophyll proteins. Although the structure of PSII has been resolved by x-ray crystallography, the mechanism underlying its assembly is poorly understood. Here, we report that an immunophilin of the chloroplast thylakoid lumen is required for accumulation of the PSII supercomplex in Arabidopsis thaliana. The immunophilin, FKBP20-2, belongs to the FK-506 binding protein (FKBP) subfamily that functions as peptidyl-prolyl isomerases (PPlases) in protein folding. FKBP20-2 has a unique pair of cysteines at the C terminus and was found to be reduced by thioredoxin (Trx) (itself reduced by NADPH by means of NADP-Trx reductase). The FKBP20-2 protein, which contains only two of the five amino acids required for catalysis, showed a low level of PPlase activity that was unaffected on reduction by Trx. Genetic disruption of the FKBP20-2 gene resulted in reduced plant growth, consistent with the observed lower rate of PSII activity determined by fluorescence (using leaves) and oxygen evolution (using isolated chloroplasts). Analysis of isolated thylakoid membranes with blue native gels and immunoblots showed that accumulation of the PSII supercomplex was compromised in mutant plants, whereas the levels of monomer and dimer building blocks were elevated compared with WT. The results provide evidence that FKBP20-2 participates specifically in the accumulation of the PSII supercomplex in the chloroplast thylakoid lumen by means of a mechanism that has yet to be determined.									98	7	0	0	91	0	104			0027-8424			WOS:000239867500077	16894144

However, this method faces the lack of descriptor for designing SACs due to limited data. Herein we proposed a robust empirical rule to estimate 312 credible limiting potentials for NRR over 104 C3N-supported SACs. It is found that the limiting potential scales clearly with the adsorption free energies of two key reaction intermediates (*N2H and *NH2), which are significantly dependent on the structure relating descriptor 4, and the activity of SACs with and without N coordination exhibits similar catalytic efficiency. We identified four high-performance SACs having moieties of CrC2N2, CrC4, MnC4 and OsC4 with high selectivity towards NRR and competitive limiting potentials of -0.40, -0.45, -0.53 and -0.54 V, respectively. The 4 values for these four SACs are around 19-25 which fall within its optimal ranges of 20-25 validating its prediction fidelity. This work broadens the discovery of two-dimensional carbon-nitrides supported SACs free of N coordination towards efficient N-2 reduction and opens a new route of descriptor-guided design of efficient SACs for electrocatalysis process.

We have used site-directed mutagenesis to replace one or both Cys residues in spinach MSP with Ala. Previous experiments using native and reduced MSP led to the conclusion that a disulfide bridge between these two cysteines is essential both for its binding and its functional properties. We report here that the disulfide bridge, though essential for MSP stability, is otherwise dispensible. The mutation C51A by itself had a delayed effect on MSP function: [C51A]MSP restored normal rates of O-2 evolution to PSII but was defective in stabilizing this activity during extended illumination. In contrast, the Cys-free double mutant, [C28A,C51A]MSP, was functionally identical to the wild-type protein. Based on results presented here, we propose a light-dependent interaction between MSP and PSII that occurs only during the redox cycling of the Mn cluster and which is destabilized by the single mutation, C51A.									43	0	0	0	38	0	43			0005-2728	0006-3002		WOS:A1996UT52200009	8664305

IPCE values are determined by a variety of factors such as the absorption constant of the active layer, bulk and surface recombination of photogenerated carriers, as well as their characteristic diffusion length. These parameters are particularly crucial in nanostructured photoelectrodes, which commonly display low carrier mobility. In this article, we examine the photoelectrochemical responses of a mesoporous TiO2 film in which the IPCE is enhanced by fast extraction of carriers via chemical reactions. TiO2 films are spontaneously formed by destabilisation of colloidal particles at the polarisable interface between two immiscible electrolyte solutions. The photocurrent arises from hole-transfer to redox species confined to the organic electrolyte, which is coupled to the transfer of electrons to oxygen in the aqueous electrolyte. The dynamic photocurrent responses demonstrate that no coupled ion transfer is involved in the process. The interplay of different interfacial length scales, molecularly sharp liquid/liquid boundary and mesoporous TiO2 film, promotes efficiencies above 75% (without correction for reflection losses). This is a significant step change in values reported for these interfaces (below 1%), which are usually limited to sub-monolayer coverage of photoactive molecular or nanoscopic materials.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			1463-9076	1463-9084		WOS:000375689200006	27103001

THE CARBOXY-TERMINAL DOMAIN OF THE D1 POLYPEPTIDE								BIOCHEMISTRY				34	17			5859	5882		10.1021/bi00017a017				MAY 2 1995	1995	To identify amino acid residues that ligate the manganese and calcium ions of photosystem II or are otherwise crucial to water oxidation, site-directed mutations were constructed in the unicellular cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 at all conserved carboxylate and histidine residues in the carboxy-terminal domain of the D1 polypeptide. Mutants with impaired photoautotrophic growth or oxygen evolution were characterized in vivo by measuring changes in the yield of variable chlorophyll a fluorescence after a saturating flash or brief illumination given in the presence of an electron-transfer inhibitor or following each in a series of saturating flashes given in the absence of inhibitor [Chu, H.-A., Nguyen, A. P., and Debus, R. J. (1994) Biochemistry 33, 6137-6149]. Mutants were also characterized after propagation in media having other cations substituted for calcium. We conclude that His-332, Glu-333, His-337, and Asp-342 influence the assembly and/or stability of the manganese cluster, that His-332, Glu-333, and His-337 may ligate manganese, that Asp-342 may Ligate manganese, calcium, or both, that Glu-333 and Asp-342 may play important structural roles, and that His-332, Glu-333, and His-337 influence the binding of calcium, although Glu-333 is unlikely to ligate Ca2+ directly. Several His-332, Glu-333, His-337, and Asp-342 mutants were very light sensitive, possibly because toxic activated oxygen species were released from altered or partly assembled manganese clusters. Finally, mutations at Asp-342 do not prevent posttranslational cleavage of the carboxy-terminal extension of the D1 polypeptide's precursor form in vivo.									115	2	0	0	92	0	116			0006-2960			WOS:A1995QW14600017	7727446

However, rapid charge recombination and low visible-light utilization are severely detrimental to photocatalytic CO2 conversion. Zero-dimensional/two-dimensional (OD/2D) heterostructures are considered the promising materials with size tunability and enhanced charge separation efficiency for photo catalysis. Herein, a OD/2D heterostructure of oxygen vacancy-rich TiO2 quantum dots confined in g-C3N4 nanosheets (TiO2-x/g-C3N4) was prepared by in-situ pyrolysis of NH2-MIL-125 (Ti) and melamine. Charge dynamics analysis by time-resolved photoluminescence (tr-PL) and femtosecond and nanosecond pump-probed transient absorption (TA) spectra revealed that charges transfer occured from 2D-g-C3N4 to OD-TiO2 at an ultrafast sub picosecond time scale ( < 1 ps) through the intimate interface. The overall fast decay of the charge carriers was attributed to interfacial charge transfer, which was accompanied by recombination relaxation mediated by shallow trapped sites. Ultrafast interfacial charge transfer greatly promoted charge separation and electrons in shallow trapped sites were easily trapped by CO2. In addition, combining with the synergetic advantage of strong visible light absorption, high CO2 adsorption and large surface area, TiO2. /g-C3N4 exhibited a superior CO evolution rate of 77.8 pmol g(-1) h(-1), roughly 5 times that of pristine g-C3N4 (15.1 pmol g(-1) h(-1)). This work provides in-depth insights into optimizing the heterojunction for robust solar CO2 conversion.									88	4	0	0	5	0	89			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000467661700076

Recently, their emergence in the aquatic environment has become a global concern. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of streptomycin on growth and photosynthetic activity of Chlorella vulgaris after 72 h exposure. We found that growth, photosynthetic activity and the content of the D1 protein of photosystem II decreased. Analysis of chlorophyll a fluorescence emission shows a reduction in the energy transfer between the antenna complex and reaction center. Also the activity of the oxygen evolution complex and electron flow between Q(A) and Q(B) were significantly reduced; in contrast, we found an increase in the reduction rate of the acceptor side of photosystem I. The foregoing can be attributed to the inhibition of the synthesis of the D1 protein and perhaps other coded chloroplast proteins that are part of the electron transport chain which are essential for the transformation of solar energy in the photosystems. We conclude that micromolar concentrations of streptomycin can affect growth and photosynthetic activity of Chlorella vulgaris. The accumulation of antibiotics in the environment can become an ecological problem for primary producers in the aquatic environment. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

J	Guo, Zhengang; Yang, Fasong; Zhang, Bo; Wang, Xiaofeng; Liu, Zhifeng								In situ formed CuInS2/SnS2 hybrid on foam-like nickel as bifunctional electrode for water splitting								ELECTROCHIMICA ACTA				405						139802	10.1016/j.electacta.2021.139802				FEB 10 2022	2022	Developing low-cost, efficient and robust non-noble electrocatalysts for overall water splitting is of primary importance in the future of energy solutions. In this paper, the CuInS2/SnS2 composite nanosheets array on foam-like nickel (CuInS2/SnS2/NF) was synthesized in situ via a facile hydrothermal approach and the successive ionic layer adsorption reaction method (SILAR). The as-obtained heterostructure array exhibits high electrocatalytic activity toward HER with a small overpotential of 78, 191 and 337 mV at 10, 20, and 100 mA/cm(2), and remarkably enhanced OER activities with the overpotential of 258, 286 and 382 mV at 10, 20, and 100 mA/cm(2) in an alkaline electrolyte. Meanwhile, the CuInS2/SnS2/NF electrode shows a lower tafel slope and outstanding electrochemical stability in both the HER and OER, displaying an excellent application foreground in the field of electrocatalytic water splitting. Moreover, the overall water splitting performance of CuInS2/SnS2/NF electrode was studied, in which the electrode serves as both the anode and cathode, and at a comparatively low voltage of 1.79 V, the current density achieves 100 mA/cm(2). This study establishes a primitive strategy for obtaining mixed multimetal sulfides on selfsupporting porous metal substrate, which can be used as an efficient bifunctional electrocatalyst, and is of great practical significance in future energy application.

The lack of effective treatment and utilization methods not only causes serious environmental pollution,but also leads to severe waste of resources. To improve this situation,a co-utilization method for the two solid wastes based on chemical looping gasification was proposed. Red mud was used to prepare an oxygen carrier(OC)and herbal medicine residue was used as a fuel for gasification, so as to achieve the energy-oriented utilization of herbal medicine residue,thus realizing effective utilization of resources and low environmental impact. To optimize the operating parameters,firstly,a thermal gravimetric analyzer was used to investigate the effects of calcination temperature on the performance of OCs;then, the effects of OC/fuel mass ratio and steam on the gasification characteristics of herbal medicine residue were studied by using a lab-scaled fluidized bed apparatus;finally,the evolution characteristics of OCs during the reaction were characterized by SEM,XRD,and BET. The results show that:OC calcined at 1 050 ℃ had the best performance; OC/fuel mass ratio of 4∶1 was most beneficial to enriching H2 in the syngas;syngas production was affected by steam significantly and its output can be maximized with 3 g/min steam. The chemical composition of OC was stable and the pore structure can be maintained well,but slight sintering on the surface during the reaction was observed by characterization.			我国年排放约1亿吨赤泥和3 500万吨中药渣,主要依靠堆放和填埋处理,缺乏有效的处置和利用方法,不仅造成严重的环境污染,亦导致极大的资源浪费.针对这一现状,提出了一种基于化学链气化技术的双固废协同利用方法.以赤泥制备载氧体,中药渣为燃料,实现了中药渣的能源化利用,具有资源利用率高、环境影响小的优势.为优化操作参数,首先使用热重分析仪探究了煅烧温度对载氧体反应性能的影响;其次在小型流化床实验台上研究了载氧体/燃料质量比、水蒸气对中药渣化学链气化特性的影响;最后通过SEM、XRD、BET对载氧体在反应过程中的演变特征开展研究.结果表明:1 050 ℃煅烧的赤泥载氧体反应性能最好;载氧体/燃料质量比为4∶1时最有利于提高合成气中H2浓度;水蒸气显著影响合成气产量,流量为3 g/min时可使合成气产量达到最大;载氧体化学组成稳定,孔隙结构能较好地保持,但反应过程中表面存在轻度烧结现象.						0	1	0	0	0	0	1			1006-8740			CSCD:6905138

Despite reports on a variety of Pt nanostructures with improved durability, a clear understanding of the structure-durability relationship is still missing as a rigorous correlative investigation is lacking. Using five-fold twinned Pd nanowires as templates, we have prepared Pt nanotubular skeleton structures which duplicate the crystal structure of the template. By comparing the durability of these structures with commercial Pt/C catalysts and Pt nanotubes, we found that grain boundaries in Pt nanocatalysts contribute most to the instability of the catalyst structures. These results not only highlight a strategy to prepare more durable fuel cell catalysts, but also provide a new method to prepare elongated Pt catalysts with controlled crystal structures, which together will perpetuate the commercial success of this green energy conversion technology.									17	1	0	0	1	0	17			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000356022800012

IR measurements performed ex situ and in situ reveal the chemical reactions which take place during annealing at the interface of silicon bonded wafers with thin native (Si/Si) or thick thermally grown interfacial oxide (Si-SiO2/Si). A comparative analysis of the IR response of the buried interface in low temperature silicon bonded wafers prepared using different surface activation treatments is presented. The evolution with annealing temperature of the chemical species at the interface is used to explain the bonding mechanism of Si wafers in the temperature range of 30-400degC. Very good bonding (~3000 mJ m-2) at 200degC was obtained between pairs of Si wafers covered with native and thermally grown oxide in the case when the wafers were treated by reactive ion etching oxygen plasma.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0953-2048			INSPEC:8974896		
P	LOMAS D A								Fluidized catalytic cracking of heavy hydrocarbons to produce gasoline and light hydrocarbons involves the use of hot stripping zone arrangement					US6139720-A	UOP LLC																			NOVELTY - Fluidized catalytic cracking of hydrocarbon involves a hot stripping zone arrangement. The stripper involves mixing of spent and regenerated catalyst to establish a uniform catalyst temperature and thorough contacting of the well-mixed hot catalyst with a stripping gas within the hot stripping zone. USE - For the production of gasoline and light hydrocarbon products from heavy hydrocarbon charge stocks such as vacuum gas oil and reduced crudes. ADVANTAGE - Production of carbon monoxide is maximized. The process delivers spent catalyst with about 1 wt.% of coke to the reaction zone and a spent combustion gas or flue gas stream having a CO2:CO ratio of at least 1. The operation reduces the heat evolution in the regeneration step and allows relatively low temperature operation of the regeneration zone without use of catalyst coolers or heat withdrawal devices. DETAILED DESCRIPTION - Fluidized catalytic cracking (FCC) of hydrocarbon comprises: (a) contacting fluidized particles of regenerated FCC catalyst with a hydrocarbon feed to produce a mixture of FCC catalyst and converted lower boiling hydrocarbons; (b) separating the mixture of FCC catalyst and converted hydrocarbons into a first gaseous effluent. The separated catalyst carries adsorbed and/or entrained hydrocarbons; (c) passing the separated catalyst through a prefactory stripping zone and contacting the particles with a stripping gas. The stripping gas strips hydrocarbons from the separated FCC catalyst and from the void volume between the catalyst particle, to produce an initially stripped catalyst and a stripper stream. The stream comprises displaced hydrocarbons and a stripping fluid that is recovered from the process; (d) passing the initially stripped catalyst and regenerated catalyst from a hot regenerated catalyst stream to an outer portion of a heated stripping zone , and mixing the initially stripped catalyst and the regenerated catalyst by injecting a fluidizing gas into a first segregated volume of the heated stripping zone. This further strips the initially stripped catalyst of additional strippable material and to produce the hot stripped catalyst; (e) filling a second, and relatively smaller, segregated volume of heated stripping zone with heated stripping catalyst by withdrawing hot stripped catalyst from the bottom of the second segregated volume, and contacting the heated stripping catalyst with a final stripping fluid in the second segregated volume to strip additional strippable compounds from the heated stripping catalyst and produces the hot stripped catalyst; (f) recovering a light gas stream comprising fluidizing gas, stripping fluid, light hydrocarbon and gaseous sulfur and nitrogen compounds from the heated stripping zone; (g) injecting a transport fluid into a regenerator transport conduit to withdraw hot stripped catalyst from the bottom of the second segregated volume and to transport the hot stripped catalyst into a regeneration zone; (h) discharging a stream of partially regenerated catalyst and gas which has an oxygen concentration of less than 5 mol% from the transport conduit into an upper portion of a dense bubbling bed of catalyst contained within a regeneration zone. (i) passing an oxygen containing regeneration gas upwardly through the dense bubbling bed of catalyst to regenerate the catalyst and produce regenerated FCC catalyst for contact with the hydrocarbon feed and the hot regenerated catalyst stream; and (j) collecting from the regeneration zone a flue gas having a CO2:CO ratio of at least 1.															0						DIIDW:2000678821

The experiments are performed behind reflected shock waves over a temperature range of 1100-1900 K at a pressure of similar to 1 bar. The effects of fuel-to-oxidizer equivalence ratio and the structure of the hydrocarbon molecule on the time profiles of the signals for each of the emitters are examined. A detailed kinetic mechanism for describing the emission signals from CH*, OH*, C-2*, and CO2* recorded during the self-ignition of hydrocarbons is developed. To make the simulations more rigorous and reliable, the NASA thermodynamic polynomials for C-2*, and CO2* were calculated based on the respective rotational and vibrational parameters given in the literature. Numerical simulations satisfactorily reproduce the measured time profiles of the signals from the studied emitters.					5th IAA Space Flight Safety Symposium5th IAA Space Flight Safety Symposium	SEP 24-28, 2018SEP 24-28, 2018	IAAIAA	St. Petersburg, RUSSIASt. Petersburg, RUSSIA	9	0	0	0	0	0	9			0094-5765	1879-2030		WOS:000489191800003

However, the trajectory and mechanisms of Earth's oxygenation are still poorly constrained, and little is known regarding attendant changes in ocean ventilation and seafloor redox. We have a particularly poor understanding of ocean chemistry during the mid-Proterozoic (similar to 1.8-0.8 Ga). Given the coupling between redox-sensitive trace element cycles and planktonic productivity, various models for mid-Proterozoic ocean chemistry imply different effects on the biogeochemical cycling of major and trace nutrients, with potential ecological constraints on emerging eukaryotic life. Here, we exploit the differing redox behavior of molybdenum and chromium to provide constraints on seafloor redox evolution by coupling a large database of sedimentary metal enrichments to a mass balance model that includes spatially variant metal burial rates. We find that the metal enrichment record implies a Proterozoic deep ocean characterized by pervasive anoxia relative to the Phanerozoic (at least similar to 30-40% of modern seafloor area) but a relatively small extent of euxinic (anoxic and sulfidic) seafloor (less than similar to 1-10% of modern seafloor area). Our model suggests that the oceanic Mo reservoir is extremely sensitive to perturbations in the extent of sulfidic seafloor and that the record of Mo and chromium enrichments through time is consistent with the possibility of a Mo-N colimited marine biosphere during many periods of Earth's history.									328	19	0	0	104	0	342			0027-8424			WOS:000318037800036	23515332

Heterojunction samples of varied WS2 compositions and fixed g-C3N4 concentrations (CNW-0.5, CNW-1.0 and CNW-1.5) were synthesized. All samples were physiochemically and electrochemically examined to understand their materials' chemistry and performance. The particle size of the composite varied from 2.55 mu m to 2.58 mu m with a high crystalline structure. The Nyquist Plot demonstrated an improved charge mobility, and the transient photo current showed a prolonged lifetime of the charge carriers for the CNW-1.0 sample. The Mott Schottky plot proved the p-n junction formation of the composite with a potential energy barrier at the junction. The time-resolved transient PL decay curves demonstrated an average lifetime (tau(avg)) of 8.51 mu s for CNW-1.0, which was 2.6 times higher than that of WS2 alone. The highest solar photocatalytic degradation of 95.5% for Methylene Blue and 84.5% for Tetracycline were achieved with CNW-1.0 in 2 h, where (O-2(-)) and (OH) radicals were dominant in the reaction. The obtained band positions suggested the Z-Scheme mechanism for the charge mobility across the heterojunction. The developed p-n heterojunction photocatalyst proved its ability in utilizing the solar energy for a robust photocatalysis reaction.									9	0	0	0	2	0	9			0038-092X	1471-1257		WOS:000707358800004

However, approaches for tailoring the rate-determining step have been largely overlooked. Herein, Ca-intercalated g-C3N4 is designed as a model photocatalyst to deeply understand the electron transportation behavior and the mechanisms of photocatalytic NO removal. The intercalation of Ca builds an interlayer channel for electron migration between g-C3N4 layers, which extends the sp(2) hybridized planes and enables the electrons to transform from a delocalized state to a localized state around Ca, leading to the formation of localized excess electrons (e(ex)(-)). Under visible light irradiation, these e(ex)(-), are subsequently captured by gas molecules for more efficient reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation and reactant activation. The ROS generated by Ca-intercalated g-C3N4 demonstrate stronger oxidation capability than those generated by pure CN. The ROS directly participate in photocatalytic NO oxidation and tailor the rate-determining step by decreasing the reaction activation energies, resulting in an overall increase in NO removal efficiency and a reduction in NO2 production. The photocatalytic efficiency and selectivity have been significantly improved owing to the functionality of the e(ex)(-). Using closely combined experimental and theoretical methods, this work provides a new approach for understanding the behaviors of e(ex)(-) in environmental photocatalysis and tailoring the rate-determining step to enhance reaction efficiency, achieving efficient and safe air purification.									115	10	0	0	26	0	116			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000446283800020

In this process, molybdenum oleate served as the source of both molybdenum and carbon, while crystalline sodium sulfate (Na2SO4) served as both reaction template and sulfur source. The remarkable integration of MoS2 and graphene in a well-assembled 2D hybrid architecture provided large electrochemically active surface area and a huge number of active sites and also exhibited extraordinary collective properties for electron transport and H+ trapping. The MoS2/G inlaid nanosheets deliver ultrahigh catalytic activity toward HER among the existing electrocatalysts with similar compositions, presenting a low onset overpotential approaching 30 mV, a current density of 10 mA/cm(2) at similar to 110 mV, and a Tafel slope as small as 67.4 mV/dec. Moreover, the strong bonding between MoS2 nanoplatelets and graphene enabled outstanding long-term electrochemical stability and structural integrity, exhibiting almost 100% activity retention after 1000 cycles and similar to 97% after 100 000 s of continuous testing (under static overpotential of -0.15 V). The synthetic strategy is simple, inexpensive, and scalable for large-scale production and also can be extended to diverse inlaid 2D nanoarchitectures with great potential for many other applications.									145	10	0	0	7	0	146			0897-4756	1520-5002		WOS:000381960300021		
J	Gao, Xueqing; Yang, Shujiao; Zhang, Wei; Cao, Rui								Biomimicking Hydrogen-Bonding Network by Ammoniated and Hydrated Manganese (II) Phosphate for Electrocatalytic Water Oxidation								ACTA PHYSICO-CHIMICA SINICA				37	7					2007031	10.3866/PKU.WHXB202007031				JUL 15 2021	2021	Asymmetric manganese cluster, the active center of photosystem II (PSII) in nature, is hydrogen-bonded to surrounding amino acid residues and water molecules. This phenomenon is of great inspiration significance for developing and studying artificial Mn-based oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalysts. Herein, we prepared manganese phosphate nanosheets through intercalation of ethylenediamine ions and water molecules ((EDAI)(H2O)MnPi) using a simple co-precipitation method. (EDAI)(H2O)MnPi is also hydrogen-bonded to interlayer ethylenediamine ions and water molecules, forming a hydrogen-bonding network. The morphology of the (EDAI)(H2O)MnPi sample was characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy. The thickness of (EDAI)(H2O)MnPi was characterized by atomic force microscopy. The composition and structure of (EDAI)(H2O)MnPi were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy. For control studies, manganese phosphate (EDAI)MnPi and (H2O)MnPi samples were also synthesized. The structure and morphology of (EDAI)MnPi and (H2O)MnPi samples were characterized by XRD and SEM. The difference between (EDAI)(H2O)MnPi, (EDAI)MnPi, and (H2O)MnPi were further characterized by thermal gravimetric analysis and derivative thermogravimetric analysis. Electrocatalytic properties of the (EDAI)(H2O)MnPi, (EDAI)MnPi, and (H2O)MnPi for OER were studied in 0.05 mol.L-1 pH = 7 phosphate buffered saline solution, through linear sweep voltammetry, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, and controlled potential electrolysis (CPE) test. The electrochemical surface area (ECSA) analyses of (EDAI)(H2O)MnPi, (EDAI)MnPi, and (H2O)MnPi samples were recorded by charging currents in the non-Faradaic potential region at different scan rates. Considering the different ECSAs of different materials, the water oxidation activities of three materials were normalized by ECSA. Compared with counterparts of (EDAI)MnPi (610 mV) and (H2O)MnPi (580 mV), manganese phosphate nanosheets (EDAI)(H2O)MnPi exhibited a lower overpotential of 520 mV when driving a current density of 1 mA.cm(-2) in neutral conditions. The CPE experiment revealed that (EDAI)(H2O)MnPi remained active for at least 10 h. Manganese phosphate nanosheets containing a rich, extensive, and continuous hydrogen bond network exhibited improved OER performance in neutral conditions. The hydrogen-bonding network in manganese phosphate nanosheets has similar functions to the hydrogen-bonding network in PSII, which could accelerate the transfer rate of protons and facilitate electrocatalytic water oxidation. This study may provide guidance for the design of water oxidation catalysts with rich hydrogen bond network.									3	2	0	0	0	0	3			1000-6818			WOS:000616616500002

Significantly, CYPs catalyze chemically challenging C-H and C-C activation reactions using a reactive high-valent iron-oxo intermediate generated upon dioxygen activation at their heme center, while the other oxygen atom is reduced to the level of water by electrons provided through a reductase partner protein. Self-sufficient CYPs, encoding their heme domain and reductase protein in a single polypeptide, facilitate increased catalytic efficiency and render a less complicated system to work with. The self-sufficient CYP enzyme from CYP102A family (CYP102A1, BM3) is among the earliest and most-investigated model enzymes for mechanistic and structural studies as well as for biotechnological applications. An increasing number of self-sufficient CYPs from the same CYP102 family and from other families have also been reported in last decade. In this review, we introduce chemistry and biology of CYPs, followed by an overview of the characteristics of self-sufficient CYPs and representative reactions. Enzyme engineering efforts leading to novel self-sufficient CYP variants that can catalyze synthetically useful natural and non-natural (nature-mimicking) reactions are highlighted. Lastly, the strategy and efforts that aim to circumvent the challenges for improved thermostability, regio- and enantioselectivity, and total turnover number; associated with practical use of self-sufficient CYPs are reviewed.

The folate species underwent at least two independent photo-oxidation pathways, which were not observed when the acid form was photolyzed at pH < 7 The presence of O-2 was essential in these oxidation pathways. Evidence for the role of singlet oxygen was established. In one of the pathways, the folate underwent cleavage, yielding 6-formylpterin (=2-amino-1,4-dihydro-4-oxopteridine-6-carboxaldehyde) and (4-aminobenzoyl)glutamic acid as photoproducts. The other pathway yielded a new photostable product A of molecular mass 455, which could be isolated and stored in acidic or neutral aqueous solution. However. A was rather unstable in alkaline media undergoing a thermal reaction to a product B of lower molecular mass (427). ne kinetics of this thermal reaction was analyzed with a stopped-flow spectrophotometer. A linear dependence of the first-order rate constant with the OH- concentration was observed. ne corresponding bimolecular rate constant was 1.1 M-1 s(-1). The quantum yields of substrate consumption and of photoproduct formation were determined. The here-reported photochemical behavior of folate solutions departs from results in acid media, where phototransformation proceeded via the cleavage of the acid form into 6-formylpterin and (4-aminobenzoyl)glutamic acid as the first major photoproducts, and where no thermal reactions were observed.									31	0	0	0	17	0	31			0018-019X			WOS:000177926000004

These changes explained the reasons for the enhanced UV/Vis photocatalytic efficiency towards oxidative degradation of ethylene and acetylsalycylic acid. The samples were characterized by a set of methods: Raman spectroscopy, Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), Diffuse-Reflectance Spectroscopy (DRS), Differential Thermal Analysis (DTA-TG), X-ray Photolelectron Spectroscopy (XPS), Transmission Electron Microscopy and High-Resolution Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM/HRTEM), Electron Paramagnetic resonance (EPR) and X-ray Diffraction (XRD) analyses. The combination of the optimal set of values of Ti3+, oxygen radicals and vacancies, Ti-O-P bonds, narrower band gap is responsible for the higher quantum yield due to the increased number of charge carriers, while the unique phase mixture prevents the recombination of charge carriers. These factors guarantee enhanced rate of the photocatalytic reaction, and extended response to the visible light region.									6	1	0	0	1	0	7			1044-5803	1873-4189		WOS:000620431000001

In this work, a simple while effective strategy was proposed to fabricate well-aligned Ni-Fe hydroxide nanosheets array on Ni foam (NiFe-OH NS/NF) by the ambient spontaneous redox reaction between Ni foam and Fe3+ and accompanied hydrolysis co-deposition of the generated Ni2+, Fe2+/Fe3+, and OH-. The tailored highly-oriented amorphous and nanoporous nanosheets structure as well as the strong electronic interaction between Ni and Fe species endow this NiFe-OH NS/NF with excellent OER activity that a large current density of 500 mA cm(-2) could be well afforded at a low overpotential of 292 mV. Importantly, the manufacturing and raw-materials cost to synthesize the NiFe-OH NS/NF by this strategy is estimated to be just $0.0165 per cm(2), much lower than those for other reported self-supported Fe-containing catalyst materials. Also, this ambient means not only could be applicable to the large-scale production of size-tunable NiFe-OH NS/NF with stable nanoarray structure, but also could be easily used for the synthesis of NiCo NS/NF and NiCoFe NS/NF for applications.									94	4	0	0	4	0	95			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000457952600087

The production of hydrogen through water splitting seems a promising and appealing solution. We found that a robust nanoparticulate electrocatalytic material, H-2-CoCat, can be electrochemically prepared from cobalt salts in a phosphate buffer. This material consists of metallic cobalt coated with a cobalt-oxo/hydroxo-phosphate layer in contact with the electrolyte and mediates H-2 evolution from neutral aqueous buffer at modest overpotentials. Remarkably, it can be converted on anodic equilibration into the previously described amorphous cobalt oxide film (O-2-CoCat or CoPi) catalysing O-2 evolution. The switch between the two catalytic forms is fully reversible and corresponds to a local interconversion between two morphologies and compositions at the surface of the electrode. After deposition, the noble-metal-free coating thus functions as a robust, bifunctional and switchable catalyst.									690	14	0	0	47	0	695			1476-1122	1476-4660		WOS:000308191700020	22863815

However, due to the limited stability, it has not been reported as a main catalyst in the photocatalytic reduction of CO2. For the first time, we have successfully demonstrated that an excellent stable monolayer BP with hydroxyl modification (M-BP-OH) can be in-situ obtained via a green exfoliation method assisted by liquid nitrogen, and used as photocatalysts for CO2 reduction. The hydroxy functional groups could occupy the lonely pair electrons site, inhibiting the reaction between this lonely pair electrons and oxygen to finally form stable monolayer BP. The as-prepared M-BP-OH showed a visible light active photocatalytic CO production rate of 112.6 mu mol h(-1) g(-1), which was 4 times higher than that of bulk BP (25.3 mu mol h(-1) g(-1)). Moreover, the M-BP-OH survived with the stringent humid air (90 % humidity, 24 h), ambient conditions (30 days) and cycling tests (300 W Xe lamp, 60 h). Metal-free BP as a main catalyst, has high potential in photocatalytic CO2 reduction demonstrated by the combined characteristics of high stability, high performance and low cost.									92	9	0	0	13	0	94			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000532683200019

When applied for ORR, CoNx/HCN-CNTs show excellent ORR activity, with good onset potential and higher current density, comparable to that of the commercial 20% Pt/C. The half-wave potential is 0.92 V (vs reversible hydrogen electrode, RHE) in 0.1 M KOH, 20 mV higher than that of 20% Pt/C. Most importantly, CoNx/HCN-CNTs display better methanol tolerance and higher stability. After 28,800 s, the current density only decreased by 1.4%. The high ORR performance maybe related with synergistic enhancement effect, in which CoNx-based nanoparticles can induce a host-guest electronic interaction and according improve the local work function of the HCN-CNTs, making carbon layer have higher ORR activity; meanwhile, the ORR activity of embedded CoNx-based nanoparticles can be greatly improved, mainly attributing to the protection of HCN-CNTs and weakness of the Ostwald-ripening-like effect in ORR progress. The features make it one of the best non-noble-metal catalysts for ORR.									23	0	2	0	0	0	25			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000502040600004

Herein, bimetallic doping strategywas adopted to obtain jasminum nudiflorum-like Fe, V doped NiS arrays (Fe, V-NiS/NF) via typicalhydrothermal process and subsequent anion exchange reaction. The as-obtained Fe, V-NiS/NF array displayshigh catalytic activity and stability toward oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and urea oxidationreaction (UOR) in alkaline media, with reduced overpotentials of 273 and 214 mV to deliver the currentdensity of 50 mA cm 2 for OER and UOR, respectively. More notably, when employing Fe, V-NiS/NF assymmetric electrolytic cell for urea electrolysis, a low cell voltage of 1.45 V is needed at 10 mA cm 2,which is about 110 mV lower than the conventional water electrolysis. Meanwhile, the catalyst also displayssuperior stability for over 72 h. Such outstanding performance is attributed to the following points:(i) 3D porous flower-like structure facilitates the mass transfer and abundant exposure of active sites; (ii)in situ growth of catalysts on conductive substrate and the effective interface engineering of differentcomposition shorten the charge transport pathways and expedite electron transfer. Density functionaltheory calculations demonstrate that the Fe and V dopants regulate the electronic environment of Ni sitesand optimize the adsorption free energy of urea. This work provides a universal pathway to design highefficientand non-noble electrocatalysts for H2 production in an energy-saving way via urea electrolysis.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1226-086X			KJD:ART002878420

Photothermal heating, local-field enhancement, and hot carrier generation have been identified as three major plasmon-induced photo physical effects, all of which are directly relevant to plasmon-driven photocatalysis. However, delineation of the contribution of each effect has long been challenging due to the strong synergy among the three effects and the mechanistic complexity of plasmon-driven molecular transformations. Aiming at unambiguously elucidating the photothermal effect, local-field dependence, and hot carrier channeling mechanisms that underpin plasmon-driven photocatalysis, we conducted a detailed case study on the aerobic reductive coupling of p-nitrothiophenol chemisorbed on Ag nanocube surfaces under near-infrared excitations. We used surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) as a plasmon-enhanced, molecular fingerprinting spectroscopic tool to track the plasmon-driven structural evolution of molecular adsorbates in real time, based on which we were able to correlate the molecule-transforming kinetics with local-field intensities and photothermal heating at the nanoparticle surfaces. The information extracted from the time-resolved SERS results allowed us not only to clarify several controversial issues regarding the photothermal effect and local field dependence but also to unravel a unique function of surface-adsorbed molecular oxygen as an interfacial charge carrier relaying cocatalyst that works in conjunction with the plasmonic Ag photocatalysts to mediate the multistep coupling reaction.									19	1	0	0	0	0	19			1932-7447	1932-7455		WOS:000493865700071		
J	Belkacemi, K; Larachi, F; Sayari, A								Lumped kinetics for solid-catalyzed wet oxidation: A versatile model								JOURNAL OF CATALYSIS				193	2			224	237		10.1006/jcat.2000.2891				JUL 25 2000	2000	Kinetic modeling of solid-catalyzed deep oxidation of pollutants in water is crucial to the design and scale-up of wastewater wet oxidation treatment. Due to their simplicity, the overall kinetics using power-law rates are often unable to capture the important features in such oxidation systems. However, detailed mechanistic approaches aimed at establishing complex reaction networks where several species and intermediates need to be identified become quickly cumbersome and costly. Lumped kinetic approaches offer a balanced trade-off between sophistication and simplicity. A versatile "three-lump" triangular kinetic model was proposed for the description of solid-catalyzed wet oxidation of various pollutants in wastewater effluents. The model is an offshoot of the well-known "generalized lumped kinetic model" introduced for homogeneous wet oxidation. This model was extended, using the Langmuir-Hinshelwood-Hougen-Watson framework, to describe the evolution of heterogeneous catalytic wet oxidation reactions. The model, in the form of a set of three implicit nonlinear differential equations, was validated using literature data obtained under a variety of experimental conditions, such as subcritical or supercritical water conditions, batch and continuous reactors, a multitude of organic loads in the form of carbon-, nitrogen-, and oxygen-bearing compounds, and using different kinetic variables such as TOC and COD. In all cases, this strategy led to calculated parameters that met the thermodynamic, kinetic, and statistical criteria. The uncertainty and confidence joint regions were estimated using bootstrap "Monte Carlo" techniques. (C) 2000 Academic Press.									35	5	0	0	7	1	40			0021-9517	1090-2694		WOS:000088488700006

The oxidation state was investigated using state-of-the-art analysis of the reaction in a continuously stirred tank reactor (CSTR) connected to a micro gas chromatograph equipped with a pulsed discharge detector (PDD) detector and ex-situ XPS. We demonstrate an initially large, but transient, peak in the oxygen production rate during the conversion of acidified water using SrTiO3 loaded with Pt nanoparticles prepared by photo-deposition (in the absence of methanol). This was confirmed by XPS analysis to be the result of a change in oxidation state from PtOx to metallic Pt. Remarkably, when PtOx was present on SrTiO3 doped with Rh delta+, the transient peak in the O-2 production was of much lower magnitude than when in the absence of Rhd(delta+). The XPS analysis demonstrates that this can be explained by the incomplete reduction of the Pt nanoparticles in the presence of Rhd(delta+). The average oxidation state of Pt deposited on SrTiO3 during the water-splitting reaction thus appears very much dependent on the absence or presence of dopants. This effect is often neglected, but is highly relevant for the discussion of composition-activity correlations of (doped) semiconductors functionalized with metal(oxide) nanoparticles in overall water splitting.									13	0	0	0	0	0	13			2044-4753	2044-4761		WOS:000386424200016

The structural features of the catalysts were characterized by X-ray diffraction, transmission electron microscopy, inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrum, and H-2 Temperature-programmed reduction. The photocatalytic property was studied by the 02 evolution from water oxidation, which was examined with respect to the influences of Ru contents as well as the oxidation and reduction treatments, suggesting the charge separation effect of the Ru species co-catalysts on different facets of TiO2 nanosheets. In contrast to Ru/TiO2 and RuO2/TiO2 with the single deposited co-catalyst, the optimized catalyst 0.5%Ru-1.0%RuO2/TiO2 with dual co-catalysts achieved a much improved catalytic performance, in terms of the synergetic effect of dual co-catalysts and the enhanced charge separation effect.									9	1	0	0	0	0	9			1674-0068	1003-7713		WOS:000388063400011

The following results were obtained: (a) within the range 0-35 degrees C, the probabilities of misses (alpha) and double-hits (beta) and the dark population of redox state S-1 exhibit similar dependencies on the temperature; (b) below a characteristic temperature upsilon(c) these parameters remain virtually independent of temperature, above upsilon(c) (upsilon(c) = 20 degrees C for alpha, and beta; upsilon(c) = 30 degrees C for S-1) the values of alpha and beta increase whereas S-1 decreases; and (c) the dark decay of S-2 and S-3 via fast and slow kinetics owing to reduction of the water oxidase by Y-D and other endogenous electron donor(s), respectively, exhibits comparatively strong temperature dependencies with the following activation energies: E(A)(S-2(fast)) = 60 +/- 10 kJ/mol, E(A)(S-3(fast)) = 55 +/- 10 kJ/mol, E(A)(S-2(slow)) = 80 +/- 5 kJ/mol, and E(A)(S-3(slow)) = 75 +/- 5 kJ/mol. These values of PQ-9 reconstituted PS II membrane fragments are very similar to those that were previously reported for thylakoids [Messinger, J., Schroder, W. P., & Renger, G. (1993) Biochemistry 32, 7658-7668]. These findings reveal that the reaction coordinates of feeding electrons by endogenous electron donors into the water oxidizing complex (WOC) that attains the redox states S-2 and S-3 is virtually invariant to Triton X-100 treatment used in the isolation procedure of PS II membrane fragments from thylakoids. Implications of these findings are discussed.									12	0	0	0	9	0	12			0006-2960			WOS:A1997WL64300013	9054550

We have obtained an insight into the complex textures resulting from this competition by studying experimentally the transformation of Au-Ag-telluride sylvanite to Au-Ag alloy under hydrothermal conditions, and exploring the effects of temperature (160-220 degrees C), pH (2-10), and redox conditions on the sample textures and the reaction kinetics. Sylvanite transformed to Au-Ag alloy over all hydrothermal conditions investigated, but not under dry conditions. The replacement was pseudomorphic, as the Au-Ag alloy preserved the external dimensions of the sylvanite grains. The resulting Au-Ag alloy was porous, consisting of worm-like aggregates with diameters ranging from 200 nm to 1 mu m. In addition to Au-Ag alloy, a range of other phases were observed as intermediate products, including petzite (Ag3AuTe2), hessite (Ag2Te), and two compositions of calaverite: an Ag-rich-Te-depleted composition, (Au0.78Ag0.22)Te-1.74, and a normal calaverite, (Au0.93Ag0.07)Te-2.The transformation of sylvanite to Au-Ag alloy follows a complex reaction path, with competing reactions proceeding either via interface-coupled dissolution and reprecipitation (ICDR) mechanism or via solid-state exsolution. Initially, sylvanite was replaced by an Au-Ag alloy following an ICDR mechanism, with sylvanite dissolution being the rate-limiting step relative to Au-Ag alloy precipitation. Tellurium was lost to the bulk solution as tellurite or telluride complexes, depending on the redox conditions. Once the concentration of Te in solution reached a critical state, the reaction switched and sylvanite dissolution was coupled to the precipitation of an Ag-rich-Te-depleted calaverite. This Agrich-Te-depleted calaverite decomposes via exsolution to calaverite and phase X (Ag3+xAu1-xTe2 with 0.1 < x <0.55), which in turn breaks down to a mixture of low petzite and low hessite below 120 degrees C via exsolution. As the reaction continues, the calaverite and phase X are all transformed to Au-Ag alloy via ICDR. In the ICDR reactions the Au-Ag alloy precipitated locally near the telluride dissolution site. Such local Au-Ag alloy precipitation is facilitated by fast heterogeneous nucleation onto the sylvanite, calaverite, and petzite surfaces. The dissolution of sylvanite and of the intermediate telluride species, and the overall reaction, are oxidation reactions. The diffusion of oxygen through the porous Au-Ag alloy layer plays an important role in sustaining the reaction.A similar combination of dissolution-reprecipitation and solid-state processes may be responsible for the formation of some of the Au and Au-Ag telluride assemblages observed in Nature. These processes may also play a role in the formation of mineral assemblages in Cu-Fe sulfide systems, where the solid-state mobility of Cu+ ions is relatively high at moderate temperatures. The interplay of different reaction mechanisms results in complex textures, which could easily be misinterpreted in terms of complex geological evolution. At 220 degrees C, solid-state replacement of sylvanite by Au-Ag alloy is slow (months), but under hydrothermal conditions sylvanite grains similar to 100 mu m in size can be fully replaced in as little as 96 h, providing a possible alternative to roasting as a pre-treatment of telluride-rich gold ores.									40	2	0	0	1	0	41			0003-004X	1945-3027		WOS:000313148500003

However, its practical feasibility depends on the development of advanced electrocatalysts, and limited experimental work has been done on non-precious-metal-based materials for the H2O2 electrogeneration in acids. Our study here introduces NiS2 nanosheets for the first time as an efficient electrocatalyst for the 2e(-) ORR under acidic conditions. In 0.05 M H2SO4, the NiS2 catalyst shows an onset overpotential of similar to 130 mV and offers high selectivity (H2O2 percentage up to 99%). Moreover, the NiS2 catalyst attains the largest faradaic efficiency of 98% and the highest H2O2 yield rate of 109 ppm h(-1) at 0.456 V and 0.156 V in the H-cell testing, respectively. The catalytic mechanism is revealed by theoretical calculations.									48	2	0	0	3	0	48			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000631985900011

Our results show that the lowest-energy structures of these clusters can be obtained by the sequential oxidation of small "core" iridium clusters. The iridium-monoxide-like clusters have relatively higher stability because of their relatively high binding energy and second difference in energies. On the basis of the optimized lowest-energy structures of neutral and cationic (IrO2)(n) (n = 1-5), DFT has been used to study the hydrolysis reaction of these clusters with water molecules. The calculated results show that the addition of water molecules to the cationic species is much easier than the neutral ones. The overall hydrolysis reaction energies are more exothermic for the cationic clusters than for the neutral clusters. Our calculations indicate that H2O can be more easily split on the cationic iridium oxide clusters than on the neutral clusters.									18	1	0	0	2	0	19			1089-5639	1520-5215		WOS:000309648800024	22985267

Like Ce(IV), periodate is a very strong oxidant that is able to oxidise water to oxygen and can be readily monitored spectrophotometrically at 280 nm, compared with 430 nm for Ce(IV). More importantly, unlike Ce(IV), which is unstable towards hydrolysis above pH 1, periodate is stable in acid, water and strong alkali. A spectrophotometric study of the kinetics of periodate reduction, and concomitant oxidation of water to O-2, reveals that in the presence of a suitable redox catalyst, Ru(Adams) in this work, periodate is able to effect the stoichiometric oxidation of water, with a turnover number >48. In just water, the kinetics of the latter reaction appear diffusion-controlled, due to the large thermodynamic driving force, a measure of which is the difference in redox potential, i.e. Delta E = 423 mV. As this difference is decreased, Delta E = 396 mV in acid and 290 mV in strong alkali (0.1 M KOH), the kinetics become increasingly activation-controlled and slower. These findings are discussed briefly with regard to the possible use of (i) periodate as an alternative oxidant in the rapid screening of new potential water oxidation catalyst material powders that are stable only under near neutral and/or alkaline conditions, and (ii) Ru(Adams) as a benchmark catalyst.									11	0	0	0	0	0	11			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000371077300012

It is often proposed that temperate species are more cold-tolerant, less heat-tolerant, more plastic, have broader thermal performance curves (TPCs) and lower optimal temperatures when compared to tropical species. However, relatively little empirical work has provided support for this using large interspecific studies. In the present study, we measure thermal tolerance limits and thermal performance in 22 species of Drosophila that developed under common conditions. Specifically, we measure thermal tolerance (CTmin and CTmax) as well as the fitness components viability, developmental speed and fecundity at seven temperatures to construct TPCs for each of these species. For 10 of the species, we also measure thermal tolerance and thermal performance following developmental acclimation to three additional temperatures. Using these data, we test several fundamental hypotheses about the evolution and plasticity of heat and cold resistance and thermal performance. We find that cold tolerance (CTmin) varied between the species according to the environmental temperature in the habitat from which they originated. These data support the idea that the evolution of cold tolerance has allowed species to persist in colder environments. However, contrary to expectation, we find that optimal temperature (T-opt) and the breadth of thermal performance (T-breadth) are similar in temperate, widespread and tropical species and we also find that the plasticity of TPCs was constrained. We suggest that the temperature range for optimal thermal performance is either fixed or under selection by the more similar temperatures that prevail during growing seasons. As a consequence, we find that T-opt and T-breadth are of limited value for predicting past, present and future distributions of species.This article is part of the theme issue 'Physiological diversity, biodiversity patterns and global climate change: testing key hypotheses involving temperature and oxygen'.									45	0	0	0	41	0	45			0962-8436	1471-2970		WOS:000473329200006	31203763

Commercial CO2 electroreduction systems will require high current densities (>100 mA cm(-2)) as well as improved energetic efficiencies (EEs), achieved via high CO selectivity and lowered applied potentials. Here we report a silver (Ag)-based system that exhibits the lowest overpotential among CO2-to-CO electrolyzers operating at high current densities, 300 mV at 300 mA cm(-2), with near unity selectivity. We achieve these improvements in voltage efficiency and selectivity via operation in a highly alkaline reaction environment (which decreases overpotentials) and system pressurization (which suppresses the generation of alternative CO2 reduction products), respectively. In addition, we report a new record for the highest half-cell EE (>80%) for CO production at 300 mA cm(-2).									158	10	0	0	10	1	162			1754-5692	1754-5706		WOS:000445215400019

Computational studies on the high coverage and mixed coverages of reaction intermediates are still challenging, especially for transition-metal compounds. In this work, we present a framework to predict differential adsorption energies and identify low-energy structures under high- and mixed-adsorbate coverages on oxide materials. The approach uses Gaussian process machine-learning models with quantified uncertainty in conjunction with an iterative training algorithm to actively identify the training set. The framework is demonstrated for the mixed adsorption of CHx, NH(x)and OH(x)species on the oxygen vacancy and pristine rutile TiO2(110) surface sites. The results indicate that the proposed algorithm is highly efficient at identifying the most valuable training data, and is able to predict differential adsorption energies with a mean absolute error of similar to 0.3 eV based on <25 % of the total DFT data. The algorithm is also used to identify 76 % of the low-energy structures based on <30 % of the total DFT data, enabling construction of surface phase diagrams that account for high and mixed coverage as a function of the chemical potential of C, H, O, and N. Furthermore, the computational scaling indicates the algorithm scales nearly linearly (N-1.12) as the number of adsorbates increases. This framework can be directly extended to metals, metal oxides, and other materials, providing a practical route toward the investigation of the behavior of catalysts under high-coverage conditions.									6	0	0	0	1	0	6			1867-3880	1867-3899		WOS:000555509000001

Over this range, the deposition rate changes by only a factor of 2.5 implying that deposition is continuing in the postdischarge with a time constant of 1 ms. For duty cycles of 30% and above, the films show good characteristics but the 10% duty cycle has a somewhat higher "p etch" implying some porosity. The pulsing reduces the compressive stress by at least a factor of two. This is correlated with the reduction in the measured plasma potential and density implying that for the present conditions, the stress is determined by the energy and number of ions striking the growing film. For the low ion energies considered here (less than or equal to 50 eV) a simple model using a temporal evolution of the ion energies and fluxes measured in an argon plasma suggests that the compressive stress would decrease in the postdischarge with a time constant of about 80 mu s, assuming that the total stress is the integral of the stress over the on and "off" periods. The experimental results in oxygen/silane plasmas show that this is probably an upper limit and the actual decay time may be considerably less.

An Aerodyne soot particle aerosol mass spectrometer (SP-AMS) was used to monitor the bulk chemical and elemental compositions of aqueous secondary organic aerosol (aqS0A) formed. AqS0A mass yields varied in ranges of 80-190% and 0-200% under sunlight and UV light conditions, respectively. AqS0A oxygento-carbon (0/C) ratio and carbon oxidation state increased steadily under sunlight + OH condition, but increased then decreased under UV + OH condition. Organic acids including malic acid, glycolic acid, formic acid and oxalic acid were formed, and their total accounted for-12% of SOA mass. The UV-vis spectral change suggested formation of light-absorbing organics. Reaction pathways were proposed by combining gas chromatographymass spectrometry (GC-MS) and SP-AMS results. Under sunlight + OH condition, oligomerization, functionalization, and fragmentation processes all involved in aqS0A evolution, with more contribution from functionalization via hydroxylation and oxygenation reactions. Reaction mechanism of UV + OH oxidation was initially dominated by functionalization then by fragmentation, indicating by the decrease of total organic carbon (TOC) contents, formation of small organic acids and low-molecular-weight products. Our work highlights that combination of SP-AMS with GC-MS is a powerful method for laboratory investigation of aqueous-phase reactions.									17	3	0	0	8	0	20			1352-2310	1873-2844		WOS:000517660200076

Herein, hollow flower-like W18O49@ZnIn2S4 core-shell Z-type heterojunctions were prepared on carbon fiber cloth (CC) by two methods, hydrothermal method and solvent heat, which are easy to operate. The prepared photocatalysts showed very excellent photocatalytic degradation for the redox removal of Cr(VI) and degeneration of bisphenol A (BPA) under simulated sunlight, and the W18O49@Znln2S4/CC composites showed 95% and 100% removal of bisphenol A (BPA) and Cr(VI), respectively. The formation of Z-type heterojunctions promoted rapid carrier transfer, and the hollow structure improved light utilization, while the core-shell structure increased the interfacial area and number of active sites. In addition, the oxygen vacancies in W18O49 have ligated unsaturated sites and unpaired electrons, which can lower the reaction energy barrier and promote molecular activation. The effects of different catalyst types, different pH values, and different initial concentrations of BPA on the photocatalytic performance were demonstrated. Furthermore, the W18O49@Znln2S4/CC composite exhibited excellent stability and reusability in 10 consecutive cycles of experiments. Its easy recovery and high stability imply potential practical applications, providing an effective strategy for the development of a new efficient catalyst for the treatment of wastewater and a sustainable environment.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0959-6526	1879-1786		WOS:000810096500002

In this work, we fabricated ternary TiO2/MoSe2/gamma-graphyne nanocomposite and demonstrated its superior photocatalytic hydrogen evolution activity. The samples were investigated by transmission electron microscopy, UV-Vis diffuse reflectance spectra, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, and photoluminescence spectra. The optimized sample exhibited a high H-2 production rate of 16 mu mol h(-1), which was 3.2-fold as high as that of binary TiO2/MoSe2 and 6.2-fold as high as that of pristine TiO2. The enhanced photocatalytic activity is mainly because of the higher light-harvesting capacity, more active edge sites, and more charge-transfer channels induced by the multicomponent heterojunction through a cascade-driven electronic mechanism. This work presents a practical way to design noble-metal-free photocatalysts for solar energy-driven water splitting by band-engineering tailoring.									5	2	0	0	1	0	5			0957-4522	1573-482X		WOS:000528139500002

In order to interpret ancient lipid signatures confidently we require a complementary understanding of how these modern biochemical pathways evolved since their conception. For example, generally it has been assumed that hopanoid biosynthesis was an evolutionary predecessor to steroid biosynthesis. Here we re-evaluate this assumption. Using a combined phylogenetic and biochemical perspective, we address the evolution of polycyclic triterpenoid biosynthesis and suggest several constraints on using these molecules as aerobic biomarkers. Amino acid sequence data show that the enzymes responsible for polycyclic triterpenoid biosynthesis (i.e. squalene and 2,3-oxidosqualene cyclases) are homologous. Numerous conserved domains correspond to active sites in the enzymes that are required to complete the complex cyclization reaction. From these sites we develop an evolutionary analysis of three independent characters to explain the evolution of the major classes of polycyclic triterpenoids. These characters are: (i) the number of unfavourable anti-Markovnikov ring closures, (ii) all-chair (CCC) or chairboat-chair (CBC) substrate conformation, and (iii) the choice between squalene and 2,3-oxidosqualene as the substrate. We use these characters to construct four competing phylogenies to describe the evolution of polycyclic triterpenoid biosynthesis. The analysis suggests that malabaricanoids would be the most ancient polycyclic triterpenoids. The two most parsimonious evolutionary trees are the ones in which hopanoid and steroid cyclases diverged from a common ancestor. The transition from a CCC- to CBC-fold marks the major divergence in the evolution of these pathways, and it is diagnosable in the geological record. However, this transition does not require the simultaneous adoption of the aerobic substrate, 2,3-oxidosqualene, because these characters are controlled by independent parts of the enzyme.									40	0	0	0	21	0	40			1472-4677			WOS:000247176400003	36298871

We show that this protein is a component of photosystem II (PSII) core particles but absent from light-harvesting complexes or PSII reaction centres. PsbX is, however, localised to the near vicinity of the reaction centre because it can be cross-linked to cytochrome b559, which is known to be associated with the D1/D2 dimer. We also show that the expression of this protein is tightly regulated by light, since neither protein nor mRNA is found in dark-grown plants.									17	0	0	0	17	0	17			0167-4412			WOS:000081950000019	10480397

Improving and Understanding the Hydrogen Evolving Activity of a Cobalt Dithiolene Metal-Organic Framework								ACS APPLIED MATERIALS & INTERFACES				13	14			16384	16395		10.1021/acsami.1c01727		MAR 2021		APR 14 2021	2021	Despite the promising previous reports on the development of electrocatalytic dithiolene-based metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), these materials often display poor reproducibility of the HER performance because of their poor bulk properties upon integration with electrode materials. We demonstrate here an in-depth investigation of the electrocatalytic HER activity of a cobalt 2,3,6,7,10,11-triphenylenehexathiolate (CoTHT) MOF. To enhance the durability and charge transport properties of the constructed CoTHT/electrode architecture, CoTHT is deposited as an ink composite (1) composed of Nafion and carbon black. We leverage here the well-established use of catalyst inks in the literature to increase adhesion of the catalyst to the electrode surface and to improve the overall electrical conductivity of the integrated catalyst/electrode. The utilization of the composite 1 leads to a significant improvement in the overpotential (eta) to reach a current density of 10 mA/cm(2) (eta = 143 mV) compared to prior reports, resulting in the most active MOF-based electrocatalyst for the HER that contains only earth-abundant elements. Extensive density functional theory (DFT) calculations were applied to understand the structure of CoTHT and the mechanistic pathways of the HER. The computational results suggest that an AB stacking geometry is energetically favorable, where one layer is slipped by 1.6 A relative to the neighboring one along the a and b vectors. Additionally, the DFT calculations indicate that the catalytic cycle likely involves a Volmer discharge step to generate a cobalt hydride, followed by a Heyrovsky step to form a cobalt-H-2 intermediate, and finally the dissociation of H-2.									12	0	0	0	0	0	12			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000641156600040	33788537

One targets the phosphodiester position involved in DNA recombination and follows a related mechanistic path. In this two-step reaction, first-strand scission is mediated by a nucleophilic attack of the scissile phosphodiester bond by the active site tyrosine of Flp. The resultant 3'-O-phosphoryl tyrosine bond is then attacked by the adjacent 2'-hydroxyl group. The second activity targets the immediately adjacent phosphodiester bond to the 3' side using a distinct mechanism. In this reaction, the vicinal 2'-hydroxyl directly attacks the phosphate group in a manner that is reminiscent of the pancreatic RNase mechanism. The Flp protein can also be shown to possess a topoisomerase-like activity.									31	0	0	0	27	0	31			1097-2765			WOS:000073342400010	9660956

The different approaches provide surface area values that are comparable and, in all cases, linearly increasing with thickness. However, whereas Cu UPD and Au oxidation/reduction methods yielded surface area values in good quantitative agreement, estimates based on EIS measurements were found to be 1.5-1.75 times larger. This discrepancy is tentatively attributed to a higher specific capacitance of nanoporous gold, possibly due both to the presence of residual surface Ag and to the high curvature of the nanoporous structures, that may have different interfacial properties as compared to planar surfaces.

Do the organic reaction mechanism pathways (ionic or free radical) decide the catalyst's facets selectivity? To answer these questions, Cu2O nanocrystals (NCs) with different morphologies were synthesized by wet chemical methods. By powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD), field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM), it was confirmed that the synthesized material was Cu2O NCs with octahedral (o-Cu2O), dodecahedral (d-Cu2O) and cubic (c-Cu2O) morphologies with {111}, {110}, and {100} facets exposed, respectively. To confirm the phase purity and eliminate any probability of the presence of Cu or CuO as impurities in the material, fitting of the experimental XRD data was carried out by employing the Rietveld refinement. The synthesized Cu2O NCs with the above morphologies were employed as the catalysts for benzylic C-sp3-H bond oxidation. For this purpose, a model reaction of oxidation of diphenylmethane (DPM) by using t-butyl hydropemxide (TBHP) as an oxidant at RT was carried out in an acetonitrile medium. Out of all the morphologies evaluated, c-Cu2O NCs show the highest activity. They could complete the model oxidation reaction within 3 days with similar to 99% yield and 100% selectivity for benzophenone as a sole product without any catalyst obliteration. Based on chemical kinetics experiments, electrochemical analyses, and DFT calculations, a reaction mechanism (similar to the Mars-van Krevelen reaction cycle for semiconductor metal oxide surfaces) involving (100) surfaces of c-Cu2O NCs was proposed. Furthermore, BET surface area analyses and zeta potential measurements were carried out to confirm the catalytic effect due to {100}, {111}, and {110} facets exposed. To demonstrate the efficiency of the developed oxidation protocol, industrially important oxidation of cumene to cumene hydmperoxide (CHP) was carried out under solvent-less conditions with 95% yield and 70% selectivity for CHP.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2468-8231			WOS:000829527600003

Using our computational results, we derive phase diagrams for different nanocarbon structures, and we report which structures are suitable for hydrogen transfers to CO2 with low over potentials. With the incorporation of N atoms, standard reduction potentials resulting in hydrogenated surfaces become less negative, and this effectively opens pathways for hydrogen atom shuttling to CO2 with reversibly hydrogenating nanocarbon catalysts. Of all morphologies considered, N-doped zigzag nanocarbon edges are most favorable for energetically efficient CO2 electroreductions. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

The instrumental technique is a refinement of that employed in the 'double-flash' kinetic fluorimeter (Joliot 1974 Biochim Biophys Acta 357: 439-448) where a low-intensity short-duration light pulse is used to measure the fluorescence yield changes following saturating single-turnover light pulses. The present instrument uses a rapid series of short-duration (2 mu-s) pulses to resolve a complete microsecond to millisecond time-scale kinetic trace of fluorescence yield changes after each actinic flash. Differential optics, using a matrix of optical fibers, allow very high sensitivity (noise levels about 0.05% F(max)) thus eliminating the need for signal averaging, and greatly reducing the intensity of light required to make a measurement. Consequently, the measuring pulses have much less actinic effect and an entire multi-point trace (seven points) excites less than 1% of the reaction centers in a leaf. In addition, by combining the actinic and measuring pulse light in the optical fiber network, the tail of the actinic flash can be compensated for, allowing measurements of events as rapidly as 20 mu-s after the actinic flash. This resolution makes practical the routine measurement of the microsecond turnover kinetics of the oxygen evolving complex in leaves of intact plants in the field. The instrument is demonstrated by observing flash number dependency and inhibitor sensitivity of the induction and decay kinetics of flash-induced fluorescence transients in leaves of intact plants. From these traces the period-two oscillations associated with the turnover of the two-electron gate and the period-four oscillations associated with the turnover of the oxygen evolving complex can be observed. Applications of the instrument to extending our knowledge of chloroplast function to the whole plant, the effects on plants of environmental stress, herbicides, etc, and possible applications to screening of mutants are discussed.									50	0	0	0	39	0	51			0166-8595			WOS:A1990EP57500004	24420583

To progress electrochemical storage and conversion devices to commercialization, improving the electrocatalyst performance and cost are of utmost importance. Research into dual-metal atom catalysts (DACs) is rising in prominence due to the advantages of these sites over single-metal atom catalysts (SACs), such as breaking scaling relationships for the adsorption energy of reaction intermediates and synergistic effects. This review provides an examination of the fundamental theoretical principles and experimental electrochemical performance of DACs in idealized half cells, as well as fuel cells, before proceeding to analyze the methods used for producing and identifying DACs. Current challenges and potential future research directions of DACs are also discussed.									13	0	0	0	1	0	13			1614-6832	1614-6840		WOS:000726558600001		
J	Yue, Guikuan; Asselin, Edouard								Kinetics of Ferric Ion Reduction on Chalcopyrite and its Influence on Leaching up to 150 degrees C								ELECTROCHIMICA ACTA				146				307	321		10.1016/j.electacta.2014.08.060				NOV 10 2014	2014	The reduction kinetics of ferric ion on chalcopyrite in the quaternary H2SO4-Fe-2( SO4)(3)-FeSO4-H2O system were systematically studied by cathodic potentiodynamic polarization (0.5 mV/s) through a wide range of solution compositions and temperatures (25-150 degrees C). Results reveal that all of the pseudo-polarization plots exhibit reproducible well-defined linear Tafel regions and thus the temperature dependence of various kinetic parameters, such as the exchange current density, transfer coefficient and rate constant, has been determined. The exchange current densities of the Fe3+/Fe2+ couple obtained by extrapolating the cathodic linear Tafel line to the reversible potential are on the order of 10(-7)-10(-5) A/cm(2) in the range of 25-150 degrees C, substantially less than that on platinum due to the formation of a passive film. In general, at the same nominal Fe3+/Fe2+ ratio, increasing the temperature from 25 to 150 degrees C was observed to give rise to an increase in io, especially when a larger amount of free ferrous existed in the solution. Based on the obtained exchange current densities, the rate constants for ferric ion reduction were calculated, and further analysis indicates that the rate constants can be well described by the Arrhenius equation. Experimental evidence clearly shows an anomalous independent variation of Tafel slope with temperature and a corresponding unexpected increased linear variation of transfer coefficient with respect to temperature (rather than being constant throughout the investigated temperature range). Analysis by mixed potential theory indicates that in the acidic iron sulfate leaching system the control scenario highly depends on both the solution composition and temperature. The importance of the cathodic ferric ion reduction reaction on the overall leaching process is progressively increased when increasing the nominal Fe3+/Fe2+ ratio and temperature. The leaching reaction is under anodic control when the nominal Fe3+/Fe2+ ratio is around 1:1, whereas at higher nominal Fe3+/Fe2+ ratios and temperatures the reaction is under mixed control, by both anodic oxidation and cathodic reduction reactions.

Furthermore, earth-abundant photocatalysts with high efficiency and product selectivity are essential for commercialization. Thus, two earth-abundant photocatalysts based on copper and nickel oxides were selected to produce solar fuels from CO2 photoreduction. The photocatalysts were immobilized on commercial glass fibers substrates by a facile one-step microwave-hydrothermal method. CuxO (x = 1, 2) and NixOy (x = 1, 2 and y = 1, 3) coatings on glass fiber were evaluated as photocatalysts in two different reactors to investigate the selectivity in a continuous reactor and a batch system. Two different light sources were employed: a heterochromatic lamp to simulate part of the solar light in the continuous reactor and a LED visible light in the batch reactor. CuO/Cu2O photocatalysts exhibited a selective production of CH4 (95 mu mol g(-1) h(-1)) and CH3OH (177 mu mol g(-1) h(-1)) from CO2 photoreduction in the continuous and batch continuous systems, respectively. The superior performance was attributed to the unique rod-shape morphology, the presence of oxygen vacancies, and efficient charge transfer in the CuO/Cu2O heterostructure with high affinity towards CO2, resulting the formation of mono- and bidentate carbonate species during the CO2 photoreduction reaction. NixOy coating with 2D cubic shape produced CO (103 mu mol g(-1) h(-1)) and HCOOH (4245 mu mol g(-1) h(-1)), associating with the low CO2 affinity and less efficient charge separation compared to CuO/Cu2O heterostructure.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			2213-2929	2213-3437		WOS:000829809000006

They have specific properties such as high acidity, oxygen-rich surface, and good redox capability from POMs. In contrast, they do not have weaknesses of POMs such as a low surface area, and high solubility in aqueous media. Herein, a novel organic-inorganic nanohybrid compound based on H3PW12O40 (PW12), a Co-based MOF, and GO was prepared. The prepared hybrid nanocomposite (PW12/MOF/GO) was characterized using different techniques. Then, a PW12/MOF/GO nanocomposite modified glassy carbon electrode (GCE) was fabricated by the drop-casting method and next was dried at room temperature. Then, the PW12/MOF/GO/GCE was subjected to electrochemical reduction at a constant potential of -1.5 V, in 0.1 M H3PO4 solution containing 0.10% w/v PW12/MOF/GO additive. The morphology, electrochemical activity, and stability of the modified electrode (PW12/MOF/P@ERGO/GCE) were studied with FE-SEM coupled with EDS, CV, and amperometry. The obtained results confirmed that the PW12/MOF/P@ERGO/GCE could be effective in hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). The electrochemical activity of the PW12/MOF/P@ERGO/GCE due to the desirable microstructure of the electrocatalyst (e.g. high active surface area and homogeneous distribution of the PW12/MOF/P@ERGO), and also the synergistic effect of the blocks, is more than those of PW12/GCE, MOF/GCE, PW12/MOF/GCE, and P@ERGO/GCE. Moreover, the PW12/MOF/P@ERGO/GCE showed an excellent long-term stability under the air atmosphere.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0				2046-2069		WOS:000772126300001	35424841

Reaction runs were carried out in a fixed-bed reactor (FBR) with concurrent upflow by feeding a 1000 mg L-1 aqueous solution on each pollutant concurrently with a gas oxygen flow. Temperature and oxygen pressure of the reactor were set to 160 degrees C and 16 bar, respectively. The basic medium was maintained by using 500 ppm sodium bicarbonate as buffer reagent to keep the pH in the range 7-8. The initial pH 3.5 was set by adding sulphuric acid. Oxidation intermediates were identified and their distribution with respect to the pollutant oxidation progress was measured. Utilizing these results, oxidation routes for each phenolic compound were deduced. The intermediates produced were diverse in acid and basic media and their composition explains the evolution of the corresponding toxicity measured at the reactor effluent. While under acidic conditions hydroxybenzoic acids, dihydroxyl benzenes and quinones were obtained as primary products, these last two compounds (more toxic than the original pollutant) were not detected in basic conditions, and with such media lower toxicities at the reactor exit were obtained. Moreover, the catalyst was found to be stable in the time range studied (300 h). (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.									78	7	0	0	22	1	83			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000238076700012

Powders were prepared by the solid state reaction method or by the EDTA precursor method. Pure Sr4Fe6O13 is stable above 775 +/- 25 degreesC in air until it melts peritectically at 1220 +/- 5 degreesC. Below 775 degreesC, Sr4Fe6O13 is unstable with respect to the formation of Sr1-xFeO3-delta and SrFe12O19. Co substituted Sr4Fe6O13 is only stable in a narrow temperature region near 900 degreesC. At higher or lower temperature, the Co-content is reduced due to formation of the perovskite SrFe1-zCozO3-delta and the solid solutions CO3-yFeyO4 (below 900 degreesC) or Co1-yFeyO (above 900 degreesC). A plate-like morphology of Sr4Fe6-xCoxO13 grains was observed both in calcined powders and in sintered ceramics. Ball milling of the calcined powders was necessary prior to the sintering in order to achieve dense materials in the temperature region 1120-1170 degreesC. Only pure Sr4Fe6O13 appeared as a single-phase material after sintering. Increasing amounts of the phases SrFe1-zCozO3-delta and Co1-yFeyO were observed with increasing sintering temperature and increasing Co-content due to the limited solubility of Co in Sr4Fe6-xCoxO13. The thermal expansion coefficient of the materials deviates from linear behavior due to the decreasing oxidation state of iron with increasing temperature. The present investigation demonstrates that Sr4Fe4Co2O13 materials with high oxygen permeability are not single-phase materials when sintered at high temperature. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

Because OHads also is an intermediate product in the anodic generation of O-2, efforts to electrocatalyze anodic O-transfer reactions must contend with undesirable co-evolution of O-2, as indicated by:(3) 2S[OHads] --> 2S[ ] + O-2 + 2H(+) + 2e(-)Efforts described to achieve this goal are based on the doping of inert metal oxide surfaces with catalyst sites at a sufficiently low density so the resulting large intersite distances (> 10 Angstrom) prevents adjacent OHads species from combining to form O-2.Evidence also grows to support the claim that a distinct benefit to anodic O-transfer reactions can come as a result of adsorption of the reactant species (R), as indicated by:(4) S'[ ] + R --> S'[R-ads]where S'[ ] represents the site for adsorption of R. The S[ ] and S'[ ] sites in Eqns. (2) and (3) may or may not be identical. Benefit of the adsorption of R is concluded to result from: (i) partial desolvation of R to facilitate an O-transfer step that probably does not occur readily by tunneling, and (ii) increased residence time for R within the electrified interfacial region to increase the probability of successful O-transfer reactions.Results are reviewed from: (i) tests of concepts described, above, and (ii) comparison of various anode materials for the electrolytic degradation of aromatic compounds chosen as models of aromatic insecticides and herbicides, These model compounds include benzene, phenol, benzoquinone, 2,4-dichlorophenol and pyridine. Major intermediate and final products are identified on the basis of chromatographic and mass spectrometric data.					10th International Forum on Electrolysis in the Chemical Industry - the Power of Electrochemistry10th International Forum on Electrolysis in the Chemical Industry - the Power of Electrochemistry	NOV 10-14, 1996NOV 10-14, 1996	Electrosynthesis Co IncElectrosynthesis Co Inc	CLEARWATER BEACH, FLCLEARWATER BEACH, FL	1	0	0	0	0	0	1						WOS:A1996BH59X00020

Elucidating its surface chemical pathways is key to improving its performance. Here, we use redox titrations in the Surface Interrogation mode of Scanning Electrochemical Microscopy (SI-SECM) to quantitatively probe in situ the reactivity and time evolution of surface species formed on hematite during photo assisted water oxidation. Using SI-SECM, two distinct populations of oxidizing surface species were resolved with measured k(si) of 316 m(3)/(mol.s) and 2 m(3)/(mol.s) for the more and less reactive species, respectively. While the surface coverage of both species was found to increase as a function of applied bias, the rate constants did not change appreciably, suggesting that the mechanism of water oxidation is independent of bias potential. In the absence of applied potential, both populations exhibit decay that is well described by second order kinetics, with k(d) values of 1.2 X 10(5) +/- 0.2 x 10(5) and 6.3 X 10(3) +/- 0.9 X 10(3) m(2)/(mol.s) for the fast and slow reacting adsorbates, respectively. Using transient substrate generation/tip collection mode, we detected the evolution of as much as 1.0 mu mol/m(2) of H2O2 during this decay process, which correlates with the coverage observed by one of the titrated species. By deconvoluting the reactivity of multiple adsorbed reactants, these experiments demonstrate how SI-SECM enables direct observation of multiple adsorbates and reaction pathways on operating photoelectrodes.									19	1	0	0	1	0	19			0003-2700	1520-6882		WOS:000427095700014	29392940

However, it has been reported that Chlamydomonas reinhardtii transformants carrying N-terminal histidine-tagged version of the PSII D1 reaction center protein could not grow photoautotrophically. We report here a successful generation of C. reinhardtii transformants expressing histidine-tagged version of the PsbA protein that are capable of photoautotrophic growth. Biochemical and physiological analyses revealed that the histidine tag present at the N terminus of the D1 subunit did not cause total instability to the PSII complex as assessed by their phototrophic growth and oxygen evolution capability. Simple one-step affinity column chromatography also revealed that the histidine-tagged D1 subunit as well as its associated proteins could be effectively purified. These transformants could potentially serve as very good tools for the study of the PSII complex particularly the D1 protein.									1	0	0	0	1	0	1			0921-8971	1573-5176		WOS:000316023400010

Doping foreign atoms into an efficient catalyst such as CoSe2 could further enhance its activity toward the HER. Herein, we developed a solvothermal ion exchange approach to doping S into CoSe2 nanosheets (NSs). We provide a combined experimental and theoretical investigation to establish the obtained S-doped CoSe2 (S-CoSe2) nanoporous NSs as highly efficient and Earth-abundant catalysts for the HER. The optimal S-CoSe2 catalyst delivers a catalytic current density of 10 mA.cm(-2) for the HER at an overpotential of only 88 mV, demonstrating that S-CoSe2 is one of the most efficient CoSe- and CoSbased catalysts for the HER. We performed density functional theory (DFT) calculations to determine the stable structural configurations of S-CoSe2, and on the basis of which, we calculated the hydrogen adsorption Gibbs free energy (Delta G(H)) on CoSe2, CoS2, and the SCoSe2 and the barrier energies of the rate-determining step of the HER on S-CoSe2. DFT calculations reveal that S-doping not only decreases the absolute value of Delta G(H) (move toward zero) but also significantly lowers the kinetic barrier energy of the rate-determining step of the HER on S-CoSe2, leading to a greatly improved HER performance.									52	2	0	0	2	0	52			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000543780900044	32490660

Deep understanding of structural and physical properties of BaTiO3 over a broad temperature range								INORGANIC CHEMISTRY COMMUNICATIONS				144						109771	10.1016/j.inoche.2022.109771				OCT 2022	2022	BaTiO3 (BT) ceramic has been prepared by the solid-state reaction method. The Rietveld refinement and the Raman spectroscopy have been employed to characterize the structural information of the BT ceramic based on the analysis of dielectric at room temperature (RT). Detailed microstructure has been observed by scanning electron microscopy. The dielectric properties of our ceramic have been investigated over wide frequency (10(2)-10(6) Hz) and temperature (-100-600 degrees C) ranges. At high temperature region (250-600 degrees C), a dielectric relaxation phenomenon has been observed. To better understand the physical mechanisms at high temperature, a macroscopic and phenomenological statistical model has been used. The calculated activation energy for relaxation and conduction was approximated to 1 eV. This suggests that relaxation in our studied sample at high temperature region is associated with the short-range hopping of ions. This is caused by oxygen vacancies in the bulk of the material. The BT ceramic demonstrated optimum electrical properties: epsilon(r) = 1105, tan delta = 0.079, T-C = 130 degrees C, epsilon(max) = 4050, P-max= 18.35 mu C/cm(2), Pr = 7.93 mu C/cm(2), E-C = 2.65 kV/cm, vertical bar Y vertical bar = 1.86*10(11) N/m(2), d(33) = 197 pC/N, kp = 14%, and Q(m) = 196. In addition, the evolution of energy storage performance with an increase in the applied electric field has been investigated. The energy storage efficiently has achieved 40 % at RT, under an electrical field of 30 kV/cm.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1387-7003	1879-0259		WOS:000848643600001

The present work aims to exfoliate the gC(3)N(4 ) stacking layers and fragment the layers horizontally to form ultra-thin nanosheets (NS) by a facile mixed-acid treatment. The surface area of gC(3)N(4 ) increased by one order of magnitude (120 m(2)/g), due to the formation of nanosheets with planar size below-50 nm. Moreover, incorporating non-metal (oxygen) anion dopants and metal (iron) nanoparticles enhances the overall reactivity of gC(3)N(4 ) NS under light irradiation. Co-integration of these strategies led to-17 times improvement in the photocatalytic pollutants degradation rate compared to pristine gC(3)N(4 ). First-principles calculations and experimental evidence suggest the formation of an intermediate band within the bandgap of gC(3)N(4 ), caused by the hybridization of N-Fe-O, which assists in harvesting a larger number of photons. Nanosheet morphology provides a shorter distance to photogenerated charges towards the surface, while the incorporation of Fe and O together offers the lowest charge transfer resistance at the interface to efficiently degrade the adsorbed pollutant molecules on the surface. With all these promoting features along with cost-effective and stable elements, Fe-O- gC(3)N(4 ) NS provides an ideal solution for tuning the intrinsic morphological and electronic structure of gC(3)N(4 ) for its effective application in various photocatalytic reactions.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000868415600004

The performance and lifetime of energy devices are critically dependent on nanoscale interfacial phenomena. From the viewpoint of materials design, the improvement of current technologies inevitably relies on gaining control over the complex interface between dissimilar materials. In this sense, interfacial nanoarchitectonics with polymer brushes has seen growing interest due to its potential to overcome many of the limitations of energy storage and conversion devices. Polymer brushes offer a broad variety of resources to manipulate interfacial properties and gain molecular control over the synergistic combination of materials. Many recent examples show that the rational integration of polymer brushes in hybrid nanoarchitectures greatly improves the performance of energy devices in terms of power density, lifetime and stability. Seen in this light, polymer brushes provide a new perspective from which to consider the development of hybrid materials and devices with improved functionalities. The aim of this review is therefore to focus on what polymer brush-based solutions can offer and to show how the practical use of surface-grafted polymer layers can improve the performance and efficiency of fuel cells, lithium-ion batteries, organic radical batteries, supercapacitors, photoelectrochemical cells and photovoltaic devices.									88	1	0	0	2	0	89			0306-0012	1460-4744		WOS:000457793900003	30543263

The 33rd IEEE International Conference on Plasma Science (IEEE Cat. No. 06CH37759)								175	175						2006	2006	Summary form only given. A time-dependent air-plasma model based upon the Boltzmann equation for the electron energy distribution function, coupled with an extensive non-equilibrium air-chemistry kinetics was developed to study the breakdown dynamics of electric discharges in preformed plasma channels. Incorporated in the model are the species balance equations, nitrogen vibrational kinetics as well as the thermal balance equation. The temporal evolution of various nitrogen and oxygen species in ground and excited states, as well as electrons, atomic and molecular ions was obtained from the model. The electrical breakdown process was studied for different combinations of applied external electric field strengths (5-30 kV/cm) and different initial electron densities (1015-1017 cm-3). The model predicts low plasma channel electric breakdown field of 5-10 kV/cm, with a delay time of hundreds of nanoseconds, when the electron density drops to ~1013-1012 cm-3. It was observed that a combination of factors such as increased ionization due to relaxation of the electron energy distribution function toward a Maxwellian distribution, strong electron detachment, and the gas heating dynamics contribute to the reduction of the breakdown field.

The efficiency of atmospheric erosion Of CO2-rich exoplanets, having the size and mass similar to that of the Earth, due to dense stellar plasma flows within close-in habitable zones of active M-type dwarf stars is investigated. Since M stars are active at the X-ray and EUV radiation (XUV) wavelengths over long time periods, we have applied a thermal balance model at various XUV flux input values for simulating the thermospheric heating by photodissociation and ionization processes, due to exothermic chemical reactions and cooling by the CO2 IR radiation in the 15 mu m band. Our study shows that intense XUV radiation of active M-stars, together with the photochemical production of excited atomic oxygen results in atmospheric expansion and extended exospheres which can interact with the stellar plasma flow. Using the calculated thermospheric neutral and ion densities, we applied a 3-D magnetohydrodynamic and a test particle model for calculating the non-thermal loss rates from the extended exospheres of magnetized and non-magnetized Earth-like exoplanets. The consequences of our preliminary results for the evolution of habitable planets within active M star environments are discussed.					14th Cambridge Workshop on Cool Stars, Stellar Systems and the Sun14th Cambridge Workshop on Cool Stars, Stellar Systems and the Sun	NOV 05-10, 2006NOV 05-10, 2006		Pasadena, CAPasadena, CA	4	0	0	0	1	0	4					978-1-58381-331-7	WOS:000255549400033

In the present work, abundant carbon defects and holes in g-C3N4 have been successfully created with a novel NH4Br-assisted programmed heating method. The decomposition of NH4Br provides an ammonia atmosphere for the preparation of g-C3N4. It also acts as an exfoliating agent, which not only dramatically decreases the average layer thickness, but also creates abundant holes on the surface of planar nanosheets. The g-C3N4 nanosheets prepared have a significantly enlarged surface area and more exposed catalytically active sites. More importantly, carbon vacancies were simultaneously introduced in the tri-s-triazine repeating units of g-C3N4, which leads to greatly suppressed recombination of charge carriers and increased concentration of photogenerated electrons and holes. As a result, this holey g-C3N4 (CN-Br) photocatalyst showed a much higher photocatalytic H-2 evolution activity (5-fold) and photooxidative ability (12 times) under visible light irradiation in comparison with bulk CN. The newly developed synthetic strategy is simple and convenient, and might be used in the design of other efficient photocatalysts.									7	2	0	0	0	0	7			2044-4753	2044-4761		WOS:000673009000001

A titanium complex, know as an effective catalyst in the reduction of nitro groups, was immobilized on the electrode surface by encapsulation into a Nafion (R) film. The different operating conditions used to prepare the modified electrode, i.e. the initial concentrations of catalyst and Nafion (R) and the sonication time, were optimized and the modification of the electrode was highlighted by cyclic voltammetry and electronic scanning microscopy coupled with energy dispersive spectroscopy analysis. The results show a good stability and reproducibility of the modified electrode. Flow heterogeneous catalytic reduction of metronidazole was then carried out with the titanocene/Nafion (R)-modified graphite felt as working electrode. The HPLC analysis underlined the total reduction of metronidazole after 1 hour and the evolution of the biological oxygen demand to chemical oxygen demand ratio showed a significant increase of biodegradability from 0.06 before pretreatment to 0.35 +/- 0.05 after electrolysis on the modified graphite felt electrode. The comparison of both homogeneous and heterogeneous reactions underlined the interest of the immobilization process that led to a higher stability of the catalyst, giving rise to a higher turnover number and an improvement of biodegradability. The stability of the modified electrode was investigated after electrolysis by cyclic voltammetry and successive electrolyses. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

This amount of water can turn into ice and block the reaction before the temperature inside the fuel cell reaches positive values. The mechanism of the physical process which leads to oxidant starvation phenomena when ice appears is not yet well identified. In order to obtain a deeper understanding of this problem, the article presents some experimental investigations conducted on a short fuel cell stack. These experiments simulate vehicle technology operated in cold start conditions not with the primary objective to reach a successful and rapid start-up but much rather to characterise and understand the cold start phenomena until starvation occurs. A number of polarisation curves, electrochemical spectroscopy and cyclic voltammetry measurements are done on the stack before, after and also during the cold starts experiments. It is observed that the process of drying and cooling down prior to cold start have a great impact on the electrochemical cathode area. The results obtained show the evolution of the stack behaviour during the low temperature operation with a slow production of frost. The consequence on the individual cells in terms of inhomogeneous degradation is highlighted.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			1286-0042	1286-0050		WOS:000293786400002

Moisture-Assisted Oxygen Activation in CO Oxidation on Gold/gamma-Alumina								JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY C				114	40			16989	16995		10.1021/jp102477g				OCT 14 2010	2010	Although a poor catalyst under dry conditions, gamma-Al2O3-supported gold (Au/gamma-Al2O3) turns out to be a superior CO oxidation catalyst under moisture conditions. In this work, extensive density functional theory calculations have been carried out to investigate the physical origin of the moisture promotion effect. By supporting Au strips on the two most stable gamma-Al2O3 surfaces, namely, the (110) and (100) faces, we show that the majority (110) surface is catalytically inert due to the saturation of Al cationic sites by dissociated H2O. On the other hand, the minority (100) surface in combination with Au is responsible for CO oxidation activity, where O-2 can adsorb at the Au/gamma-Al2O3(100) interface with a tilted Au-O-O-Al-5c configuration. In the presence of coadsorbed H2O and CO, the adsorption energy of O-2 reaches to 0.7 eV. We find that H2O enables the direct dissociation of the reaction intermediate cis-OCOO produced by the bimolecular coupling between CO and O-2, whereas an extra cis-to-trans rotation of OCOO is required in the absence of H2O. In the H2O-assisted pathway, no atomic oxygen is produced, and the overall barrier is only 0.25 eV, which is 0.28 eV lower than that without H2O. By electronic structure analyses, we suggest that a modest acidity of the gamma-Al2O3 (100) surface contributes to the O-2 adsorption. although Al2O3 lacks the d-states that were shown to be important for O-2 activation.									23	3	0	0	1	0	24			1932-7447	1932-7455		WOS:000282546000016

Deposition of clusters and nanoparticles onto boron-doped diamond electrodes for electrocatalysis								JOURNAL OF APPLIED ELECTROCHEMISTRY				36	8			847	862		10.1007/s10800-006-9159-2				AUG 2006	2006	Metal and metal oxide particles and nanoparticles, differing from each other by their nature and synthesis technique, were deposited onto boron-doped diamond (BDD) thin film electrodes. The applicability in electrocatalysis of thermally decomposed IrO2 and Au nanoparticles, electrodeposited Pt particles, dendrimer-encapsulated Pt nanoparticles (Pt DENs) and microemulsion-synthesized Pt/Ru nanoparticles was studied, once deposited on BDD substrate. In all cases, the electrochemical response of the composite electrodes could be solely attributed to the supported particles. All the particles, with the exception of Pt DENs, exhibited electrocatalytic activity. Pt DENs inactivity has been attributed to insufficient removal of the dendrimer polymer matrix. It was concluded that the BDD electrode is a suitable substrate for the electrochemical investigation of supported catalytic nanoparticles.									49	0	0	0	2	1	51			0021-891X	1572-8838		WOS:000239038400001

Ion-ion plasmas from discharges based on electron beam ionization								IEEE Conference Record - Abstracts. PPPS-2001 Pulsed Power Plasma Science 2001. 28th IEEE International Conference on Plasma Science and 13th IEEE International Pulsed Power Conference (Cat. No.01CH37255)								158	158		10.1109/PPPS.2001.960720				2001	2001	Use of both positive and negative ions in plasma processing of materials has been shown to be advantageous in terms of better feature evolution and control. The formation of these ion-ion plasmas is dictated by electron attachment to the neutral gas, which is enhanced at low electron temperatures. Thus, ion-ion plasmas are usually formed in the afterglow of a pulsed plasma as the electron temperature drops during the plasma decay. Discharges produced by electron-beams inherently have low electron temperatures (<1 eV in molecular gases), and therefore are good candidates to form ion-ion plasmas continuously. Using simple Langmuir probes, we have studied the electronegative gases O2 and SF6 which have very different attachment cross sections resulting in very different ionic species. Analysis of temporally resolved plasma characteristics deduced from these measurements will be presented for pure O2 and Ar/SF6 mixtures with mixture fractions varying from 0-100%. Oxygen discharges show no noticeable negative ion contribution during the active or afterglow. In contrast, SF6 discharges demonstrate ion-ion plasma characteristics in the active glow and are completely ion-ion in the afterglow. Comparison between these discharges with accepted cross sections and production mechanisms will also be presented.					IEEE Conference Record - Abstracts.

J	Zhao, Yue; Yang, Ping; Li, Jia								Fabrication of one-dimensional MnxCd1-xS@D-MoSeyS2-y heterostructure with enhanced visible-light photocatalytic hydrogen evolution								INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY				46	43			22422	22433		10.1016/j.ijhydene.2021.04.063		JUN 2021		JUN 23 2021	2021	Developing a visible light photocatalysts for hydrogen (H-2) production to replacing fossil fuels is a huge challenge. Herein, one-dimensional MnxCd1-xS@D-MoSeyS2-y heterostructure was prepared for improving the hydrogen generation. The molar ratio of Mn to Cd in MnxCd1-xS solid solution was adjusted, which effectively enhances the photocatalytic H-2 evolution efficiency. MoSeyS2-y with defects (D-MoSeyS2-y) was synthesized by solvothermal method during the photocatalytic process as cocatalyst, which wrapping on the MnxCd1-xS solid solution. MnxCd1-xS@ D-MoSeyS2-y shows improved photocatalytic H-2 evolution activity, which was endowed by suitable energy band structure, exposure of active sites, high carrier concentration and fast electrons transfer. The highest photocatalytic H-2 evolution rate of sample among prepared MnxCd1-xS@D-MoSeyS2-y is 12.46 mmol/g/h, which is equivalent to 37 times that of CdS. This present study offers a insight to the preparation of CdS-based photocatalysts. (C) 2021 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

J	Suzuki, T; Yuasa, H; Imai, K								Convergent evolution. The gene structure of Sulculus 41 kDa myoglobin is homologous with that of human indoleamine dioxygenase								BIOCHIMICA ET BIOPHYSICA ACTA-GENE STRUCTURE AND EXPRESSION				1308	1			41	48		10.1016/0167-4781(96)00059-0				JUL 31 1996	1996	The abalone Sulculus diversicolor contains abundant myoglobin in its buccal mass. The myoglobin consists of 377 amino acid residues and has a molecular mass of 41 000 Da, 2.5 times larger than that of other myoglobins. Sulculus myoglobin can bind oxygen reversibly, and the P-50 was determined to be 3.8 mmHg at 20 degrees C and pH 7.4, showing that the oxygen affinity of Sulculus myoglobin is lower than those of vertebrate and invertebrate myoglobins. The cDNA-derived amino acid sequence showed no significant homology with those of any other invertebrate myoglobins and hemoglobins, but surprisingly showed 35% homology with a vertebrate tryptophan-degrading enzyme, indoleamine dioxygenase (IDO). The structure of the Sulculus myoglobin gene has been determined to consist of 14 exons and 13 introns (15.3 kbp). Compared with the gene of human IDO (10 exon-9 intron structure), the splice junctions of 7 introns were exactly conserved between the two genes, suggesting that these introns have been conserved for at least 600 million years. The Sulculus gene has 5 additional introns, one of which is located outside the coding region. From these results we conclude that Sulculus myoglobin evolved from an IDO gene and represents a typical case of functional convergence. Comparison of the amino acid sequence of each exon of Sulculus myoglobin with those of usual globin sequences showed that then is no significant evolutionary relationship between them. The IDO-like myoglobin is unexpectedly widely distributed among gastropodic molluscs, such as Sulculus, Nordotis, Battilus, Omphalius and Chlorostoma.									20	1	0	0	16	0	26			0167-4781			WOS:A1996VB03500009	8765749

Herein, in situ X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) coupled with ab initio FEFF calculations rule out specific adsorption of AM(+) and hydroxyl (OHad) but not interfacial water with the oxygen facing toward the Pt surface (H2O down arrow(ad)) within the hydrogen underpotential deposition (H-UPD) potential region in alkaline solutions. We further show that AM(+) greatly affects the H-UPD peaks and the kinetics of the hydrogen evolution/oxidation reactions (HER/HOR) of Pt in alkaline solutions. We accordingly propose that H2O down arrow(ad) is specifically adsorbed on undercoordinated Pt surfaces and bonded with the water molecules coordinated to AM(+), forming the sandwich structure of Pt-H2O down arrow(ad)center dot center dot center dot[(H2O)(x)-AM](+) across the interface; and the exchange between the H2O down arrow(ad)center dot center dot center dot[(H2O)(x)-AM](+) and Had yields the sharp H-UPD peaks. The AM(+) weakens the Pt-H2O down arrow(ad) bond via noncovalent interactions and in turn positively shifts the H-UPD peaks and hinders the HOR by delaying the oxidative removal of H-ad. The AM(+) promotes the HER of Pt by facilitating the removal of the OHad in the form of OHad center dot center dot center dot[(H2O)(x)-AM](+) subsequent to the dissociation of H2O down arrow(ad).									14	1	0	0	0	0	14			2155-5435			WOS:000577156300024

In this work, we report the in-situ growth of ultrathin MOF material (ZIF-67) nanosheets on conductive Ti@TiO2/CdS substrate for high-efficient electrochemical catalysis due to optimized charge transport. The ultrathin ZIF-67 nanosheets were grown on Ti@TiO2/CdS nanowire array substrates resulting unique 3D hierarchical structures, which were investigated as electrocatalyst for the oxygen-evolution reaction (OER) and H2O2 oxidation. The nanowire-supported ZIF-67 nanosheet electrode shows remarkable electrocatalytic activity and excellent stability toward OER and H2O2 oxidation, which can be explained by the rapid electron transport along the 1D Ti@TiO2/CdS nanowire to Ti substrates, large electrochemical active surface area and the rising valence state of Co ions induced by electronegative N atom in imidazole ligands. Compared with other MOFs catalysts, we obtained a very small Tafel slope (42 mV/dec) and a small overpotential (0.41 V) at 10 mA cm (2) for OER. When used for H2O2 detection, the electrode gave a high sensitivity of 1214.3 mu AmM (1)cm (2), a wide linear range of 5 mu M-14mM and a low detection limit of 1.11 mu M. This research suggests that the in-situ grown nanostructure of Ti@TiO2/CdS/ZIF-67 hold great promise for advanced electrocatalytic electrode in water oxidation and H2O2 detection.

Then, the hierarchical Bi2MoO6/Mn0.2Cd0.8S heterostructured composite was prepared by combining Mn0.2Cd0.8S composite with Bi2MoO6 nanocrystalline through a hydrothermal process. The optimized Mn0.2Cd0.8S composite's photocatalytic activity is more than 3 times of pristine CdS and the prepared Bi2MoO6/Mn0.2Cd0.8S nanocomposites exhibited a significantly improved photocatalytic activity for hydrogen evolution from water with visible light response comparing with single Mn0.2Cd0.8S composite. The optimized photocatalytic activity of Bi2MoO6/Mn0.2Cd0.8S composite is around 10 times of pristine CdS. The excellent photocatalytic activity of Bi2MoO6/Mn0.2Cd0.8S composite might be ascribed to the well-matched energy band structures of the Bi2MoO6 and Mn0.2Cd0.8S. Furthermore, the heterojunctions in Bi2MoO6/Mn0.2Cd0.8S composite might also do some contributions to improve its photocatalytic activities to some extent. A possible photocatalytic mechanism was proposed. Due to its excellent photocatalytic activity and good stability for hydrogen evolution from water, the obtained hierarchical Bi2MoO6/Mn0.2Cd0.8S composite has potential application in photocatalytic hydrogen evolution from water by using solar power.

J	Lang, Sandra M.; Helzel, Irene; Bernhardt, Thorsten M.; Barnett, Robert N.; Landman, Uzi								Spin-Gated Selectivity of the Water Oxidation Reaction Mediated by Free Pentameric CaXMn5-XO5+ Clusters								JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN CHEMICAL SOCIETY				144	33			15339	15347		10.1021/jacs.2c06562		AUG 2022		AUG 24 2022	2022	We report on the first preparation of isolated ligandfree CaMn4O5+ gas-phase clusters, as well as other pentameric CaxMn5-xO5+ (x = 0-4) clusters with varying Ca contents, which serve as molecular models of the natural CaMn4O5 inorganic cluster in photosystem II. Ion trap reactivity studies with D2O and H218O reveal a pronounced cluster composition-dependent ability to mediate the oxidation of water to hydrogen peroxide. First-principles density functional theory simulations elucidate the mechanism of water oxidation, proceeding via formation of a terminal oxyl radical followed by oxyl/hydroxy (O/OH) coupling. The critical coupling reaction step entails a single electron transfer from the oxyl radical to the accommodating cluster core with a concurrent O/OH coupling forming an adsorbed OOH intermediate group. The spin-conserving electron transfer step takes place when the spin of the transferred electron is aligned with the spins of the d-electrons of the Mn atoms in the cuboidal high-spin cluster isomer. The d electrons provide a ferromagnetically ordered environment that facilitates the spin-gated selective electron transfer process, resulting in parallel-spin-exchange stabilization and a lowered transition state barrier for the coupling reaction involving the frontier orbitals of the oxyl and hydroxy reactant intermediates.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0002-7863	1520-5126		WOS:000840927100001	35943864

It was found that the sulfur content of 50 ppm in the electrode decreased to 8-12 ppm in the air atmosphere, while reduced to 9-14 ppm in a protective atmosphere. The desulfurization rates were 82% and 78%, respectively. Correspondingly, the sulfur content of 0.12% in initial slag increased to 0.125% and 0.15%. The coupled desulfurization kinetics model was established, the oxygen activity (ao) and sulfur distribution coefficient (L-s) are taken into consideration, and they change with the remelting time during the calculation. The results show that the calculated values are in good agreement with the experimental values. The desulfurization effect at the electrode tip is significantly better than the positions where the droplet passes through the slag layer and the slag pool/molten pool interface. The Ls and comprehensive mass transfer coefficient of sulfur (k*(s)) decrease with the remelting time,. while the ao at each reaction position increases. Compared with the protective atmosphere, L-s and k*(s) have larger values during the air atmosphere ESR process, but the ao value is equal. Under the different atmospheres, the most types of inclusions in the steel are MnS, and the refining atmosphere has no significant effect on the types of inclusions.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0915-1559	1347-5460		WOS:000630090800026

Surface-Specific DFT plus U Approach Applied to alpha-Fe2O3(0001)								JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY C				120	9			4919	4930		10.1021/acs.jpcc.5b12144				MAR 10 2016	2016	We report the bulk properties and ab initio thermodynamics surface free energies for alpha-Fe2O3(0001) using density functional theory (DFT) with calculated Hubbard U values for chemically distinct surface Fe atoms. There ate strong electron correlation effects in hematite that are not well described by standard DFT. A better description can be achieved by using a DFT + U approach in which U represents a Hubbard on-site Coulomb repulsion term. While DFT + U calculations result in improved predictions of the bulk hematite band gap, surface free energies using DFT + U total energies result in surface structure predictions that are at odds with most experimental results. Specifically, DFT + U predictions stabilize a ferryl termination relative to an oxygen termination that is widely reported under a range of experimental conditions. We explore whether treating chemically distinct surface Fe atoms with different U values can lead to improved bulk and surface predictions. We use a linear response technique to derive specific U-d values for all Fe atoms in several slab geometries. We go on to add a Coulomb correction, U-p, to better describe the hybridization between the Fe d and oxygen p orbitals, accurately predicting the structural and electronic properties of bulk hematite. Our results show that the site specific U-d is a key factor in obtaining theoretical results for surface stability that are congruent with the experimental literature results of alpha-Fe2O3(0001) surface structure. Finally, we use a model surface reaction to trace how the various DFT + U methods affect the surface electronic structure and heterogeneous reactivity.									73	1	0	0	3	0	74			1932-7447			WOS:000372042600023

In order to reduce the number of experiments, the study was carried out using a two-level fractional factorial design with resolution III. It was observed that the charge depends mainly on the temperature of calcination and on the composition of the precursor solution. An average decrease of 26.9 (mC cm(-2) mg(-1)) was observed by changing the calcination temperature from 400 to 500 degrees C. The average anodic charge decreased by 8.93 (mC cm(-2) mg(-1)) when the molar ratio CA/EG (citric acid/ethylene glycol) was changed from 1:6 to 1:12. A similar behaviour was observed when the molar ratio between CA/PS (citric acid/precursor salt) was changed from 6:1 to 12:1, a decrease of 10.3 (mC cm(-2) mg(-1)) being observed. The anodic charge decrease also occurred by increasing the time of calcination as well as controlling the heating rate. Once the temperature was the main variable affecting the anodic charge it was widely investigated in a range between 250 and 700 degrees C. A maximum anodic charge was observed at 300 degrees C while the electrode calcinated at 600 degrees C showed the maximum value in the accelerated stability test (AST) for the oxygen evolving reaction in acid medium. The effects observed on the electrochemical properties were correlated with the morphological and microstructural changes occurring in the samples. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd.

To affirm the characteristics of alkaline stress and the subsequent adaptive responses in Arthrospira platensis NIES-39 and Arthrospira platensis PCC 7345, photosynthetic pigments, spectral properties of thylakoids, PSII and PSI activities, and pigment-protein profiles of thylakoids under different pH regimes were examined. The accessory pigments showed a pH-mediated sensitivity. The pigment-protein complexes of thylakoids are also affected, resulting in the altered fluorescence emission profile. At pH 11, a possible shift of the PBsome antenna complex from PSII to PSI is observed. PSII reaction center is found to be more susceptible to alkaline stress in comparison to the PSI. In Arthrospira platensis NIES-39 at pH 11, a drop of 68% in the oxygen evolution with a significant increase of PSI activity by 114% is recorded within 24 h of pH treatment. Alterations in the cellular ultrastructure of Arthrospira platensis NIES-39 at pH 11 were observed, along with the increased number of plastoglobules attached with the thylakoid membranes.

It is postulated that these components represent ejecta from the precursor star's helium mantle and a mixture involving products of oxygen burning, respectively. There is striking spatial asymmetry, with the nitrogen-rich gas located primarily in the north-northwest part of the remnant and the sulfur-rich mixture found mainly south of the pulsar. This implies directional ejection of the more highly processed material. The nitrogen-rich gas is also characterized by higher velocities, as would be expected from an accelerating shock following core bounce.									23	0	0	0	0	0	23			0004-637X	1538-4357		WOS:A1996UM94500025

In the present study, microstructure and defect evolution in the oxidized SiC layer of surrogate TRISO fuel particles under 1.2 MeV krypton ion irradiation was observed by in-situ transmission electron microscopy. The SiC layers oxidized in water vapor at 1200 degrees C were irradiated azt room temperature and 800 degrees C and at damage levels of 0.28-11.2 dpa, respectively. SiC and SiO2 were found to still be in their crystal structures at the damage level of 11.2 dpa at 800 degrees C, while SiC was observed to have been amorphized at only 0.56 dpa irradiation at room temperature. The defect number density at 800 degrees C was an order of magnitude lower than that in the sample irradiated at room temperature. Also, crystalline SiO2 had higher radiation resistance compared to SiC. A defect reaction rate theory was utilized to understand the fundamental defect evolution process and irradiation resistance difference. (C) 2022 Elsevier B.V.

J	Lascelles, D.F.				Lascelles, Desmond/AAQ-5950-2020				Plate tectonics caused the demise of banded iron formations								Applied Earth Science				122	4			230	41		10.1179/1743275814Y.0000000043				Dec. 2013	2013	Early models for the origin of banded iron formations (BIFs) assumed that under a reducing atmosphere the supergene anoxic hydrolysis of mafic silicate minerals would provide an abundance of ferrous iron in solution to be transported to the oceans, there to be oxidised and precipitated by locally produced oxygen in shallow seas. The sparse distribution of BIFs in the Archaean era, its greater abundance during the Palaeoproterozoic era and perceived absence thereafter was considered to be essentially linked to the concentration of O2 in the atmosphere and this was a key factor in hypotheses of atmospheric evolution from anoxic to oxidising. Several assumptions regarding the deposition of BIFs were used to infer atmospheric evolution; however, chemical considerations indicate that the deposition of BIF is independent of atmospheric oxygen levels. Ferrous iron is only soluble in acid solution and in anoxic conditions in natural waters is precipitated as ferrous hydroxide or by carbon dioxide as ferrous carbonate. Silica in solution typically exists in equilibrium between ionic solution and colloidal suspension. Flocculation of colloidal silica is catalysed by the presence of cations and polymerises to a hydrophobic gel, thus removing silica from solution. It is highly unlikely that the oceans could ever have been the reservoir of iron and silica for the deposition of BIFs. Modern interpretations consider BIFs as deep sea sediments with the source of the iron and silica derived from reactions between circulating sea water and hot mafic to ultramafic rocks producing hydrothermal systems venting onto the sea floor. The solubility of ferrous and ferric iron and silica is greatly increased at elevated temperatures and hydrothermal solutions would immediately precipitate iron hydroxide and iron silicates on quenching by cold seawater, even in the absence of ambient oxygen, to form hydrothermal plumes and mound deposits, subsequently resedimented by turbidity and density currents across the ocean floor. No transportation of ferrous iron in solution at ambient temperatures and no external source of O2 or Fe2+ is necessary and the deposition of BIFs was independent of atmospheric oxygen, biogenic processes and continental sources of dissolved ferrous iron and silica, although any or all of these may have been present during deposition. A similar process occurs today with black smoker hydrothermal vents depositing large quantities of iron hydroxide and iron silicates on the ocean floor that will eventually be subducted beneath the continents by plate tectonic processes. During the Archaean era, shallow oceans and immature continents, preserved sea floor deposits as greenstone belts and in marginal sedimentary basins until the formation of large buoyant continents caused the subduction of deep sea ocean crust including BIF deposits. The temporal distribution of BIFs is thus related to the preservation of deep ocean sedimentary rocks that since the onset of modern style plate tectonics in the late Archaean to Proterozoic eras have largely been destroyed by subduction of the ocean floor beneath the continents.									6	1	0	0	0	0	7			0371-7453			INSPEC:14379965

We perform a series of three-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations of turbulence driven with various degrees of compressibility. The average conditions in the simulations are representative of models of merging binary white dwarfs. We find that material with very short ignition times is abundant in case turbulence is driven compressively. This material forms contiguous structures that persist overmany ignition times, and that we identify as prospective detonation kernels. Detailed analysis of prospective kernels reveals that these objects are centrally condensed and their shape is characterized by low curvature, supportive of self-sustained detonations. The key characteristic of the newly proposed detonation mechanism is thus high degree of compressibility of turbulent drive. The simulated detonation kernels have sizes notably smaller than the spatial resolution of any white dwarf merger simulation performed to date. The resolution required to resolve kernels is 0.1 km. Our results indicate a high probability of detonations in such well-resolved simulations of carbon-oxygen white dwarf mergers. These simulations will likely produce detonations in systems of lower total mass, thus broadening the population of white dwarf binaries capable of producing Type Ia supernovae. Consequently, we expect a downward revision of the lower limit of the total merger mass that is capable of producing a prompt detonation. We review application of the new detonation mechanism to various explosion scenarios of single, Chandrasekhar-mass white dwarfs.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			0035-8711	1365-2966		WOS:000399429600007

Photocatalysis is a process that aims to efficiently convert solar-to-chemical energy. This technology is extensively used in the environmental and energy fields, water purification systems and hydrogen evolution. This paper surveys metal oxides' antibacterial properties with special attention to reactive oxygen species (ROS), lipid peroxidation as a main process governing photocatalytic activity against E. coli, and theoretical models aiming at predicting disinfection rates. Furthermore, the paper highlights ways to improve photocatalytic efficiency, such as increased amount of ROS, specific light spectrum and intensity, and particles' morphology. This work would be incomplete without attention to physiochemical toxicity mechanisms towards E. coii. These processes are primarily based on metal oxides' solubility, and depending upon solubility properties, the mechanism is driven either by physical (mechanical) or chemical (metal ions) interaction. Finally, potential challenges to overcome during ROS-bacteria interaction (like, gas and nanobubbles formation) are enumerated. The review aims to fill the gap between photocatalysis as a chemical reaction and photocatalysis as a disinfection process. It would be helpful for materials scientists to get acquainted with another application of semiconductors, and challenges/opportunities laying on the boundary between materials and biological sciences.

The obtained W NPs has been spin-coated on graphite (C) electrodes. Heat treatment of the W/C electrodes at elevated temperatures (>= 900 degrees C) allows the preparation of metallic W and tungsten carbide (W2C@WC) thin films. The obtained W2C@WC electrodes were used for hydrogen evolution studies (HER) in 0.5 M H2SO4. Cyclic voltammetry tests for 1000 cycles showed that W2C@WC exhibit long term stability without significant drop in current density. The overpotential defined at 10 mA/cm(2) is 310 mV vs. RHE giving an excellent catalytic activity for HER. Materials characterization has been achieved using transmission electron microscopy (TEM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). Here, EIS studies were used to access the charge-transfer resistance of tungsten carbide electrodes.									73	4	1	0	2	0	74			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000437965900015

While the cathode particle degradation is a problem other issues contribute to electrochemical performance loss. Graphite/LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 cells have been cycled to different upper cutoff voltages and investigated with electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), gas analysis with online electrochemical mass spectroscopy (OEMS), nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, gas chromatography with MS (GCMS) and inductively coupled plasma MS (ICP-MS). Increased gas evolution was observed when the upper cutoff voltage was increased from 4.2 to 4.6 V. An increase in O-2 evolution upon cycling as well as an increase of CO2 upon increasing the voltage, have been observed. More electrolyte decomposition products are observed on the anode for cells cycled to higher voltage. An increased amount of nickel has been detected on the graphite electrode in accordance with an increased reaction of the cathode surface with the electrolyte leading to transition metal dissolution. Finally, an increase in carbonate solvent transesterification products has been observed. (c) The Author(s) 2019. Published by ECS.

In this work, the photocatalytic degradation of Aldrich-Sigma HA as a model of refractory organic of stabilised leachate was studied. The experiments were carried out in HA aqueous suspension of TiO2 (P-25) in CPC reactor at pilot-plant scale in the Plataforma Solar de Almeria (Spain) under solar irradiation and natural pH. The adequate quantity of catalyst for this process was found to be 0.7 g(1-1). The effect of inorganic ions, commonly present in real leachate such as HCO3-, SO42-, Cl- on photocatalytic degradation of HA was also studied. The ions examined, even in higher concentration for Cl- (4.5 g/l) and SO42- (7.75 g/l) were found to not affect the photocatalytic process and the similar efficiency of HA removal was ensured. However, the presence of hydrogen carbonate into solution matrix inhibited strongly the photocatalytic reaction. The catalytic oxidation of HA, in particular in the mixture of anions, did not agree with Langumir-Hinshelwood kinetics and the evaluation of results was expressed only as an effect of HA removal versus accumulated energy (Q(UV), kJ 1(-1)) by photoreactor. Moreover, the effect inorganic matrix on initial adsorption of HA has been discussed on the basis of the results obtained in laboratory batch test. Additionally, the biodegradability evolution during photodegradation of HA was evaluated in terms of biological oxygen demand (BOD5) as well as by oxygen uptake rate. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V.

Platinum-, iridium- and ruthenium-containing coatings were deposited onto titanium substrates. Platinum bis-(2,4-pentanedionate), iridium tris-(2,4-pentanedionate), and ruthenium tris-(2,4-pentanedionate) were used as precursors. Corrosion resistance of the obtained samples is investigated with respect to the deposition conditions (substrate temperature and flow rate of the gas reagent-oxygen). Investigation was carried out using the electrolysis in seawater simulated solutions under active evolution of oxygen. It is stated that platinum coatings exhibit longer mean lifetime, in comparison with iridium and ruthenium samples. Service lifetime of the best electrodes exceeded 600 hours.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1155-4339			INSPEC:7149463

Enhanced electrical properties of TiO2 are ensured, especially by a careful selection of the bottom electrode material. Iridium dioxide (IrO2) is an excellent choice, as it favors the high-k rutile phase growth of TiO2. In this study, we introduce the fabrication of IrO2/TiO2/IrO2 capacitors and thoroughly characterize their electrical behavior. These capacitors show a dielectric constant for low temperature sputtered TiO2 of similar to 70. From leakage current measurements, a coupled capacitive-memristive behavior is determined, which is assumed due to the presence of a reduced TiO2-x layer at the IrO2/TiO2 interface observed from transmission electron microscopy analyses. The memristive effect most probably originates from trapping and detrapping of electric charges in oxygen vacancy defects, which themselves can be generated and annihilated through an applied electric field, subsequently changing the resistance of the capacitor. The electric degradation type is identified as a filament-forming mechanism. Additionally, the temperature dependence of the leakage current is measured, demonstrating that the temperature behavior is strongly influenced by the ambient atmosphere. The latter dependency leads to the hypothesis that the oxygen evolution reaction of water incorporated in the IrO2/TiO2 interface passivates vacancies, thus significantly impacting the vacancy density in TiO2 and, as a further consequence, the electrical performance.

We speculated that ancient protection mechanisms could still be present in cyanobacteria and studied the effect of ionizing radiation and space flight during the Foton-M4 mission on Synechocystis sp. PCC6803. Spectral and functional characteristics of photosynthetic membranes revealed numerous similarities of the effects of alpha-particles and space flight, which both interrupted excitation energy transfer from phycobilisomes to the photosystems and significantly reduced the concentration of phycobiliproteins. Although photosynthetic activity was severely suppressed, the effect was reversible, and the cells could rapidly recover from the stress. We suggest that the actual existence and the uncoupling of phycobilisomes may play a specific role not only in photo-, but also in radioprotection, which could be crucial for the early evolution of Life on Earth.									3	0	1	0	4	0	4			0005-2728	1879-2650		WOS:000457660700002	30465750

Photoinhibition occurs when light energy absorption largely exceeds the energy consumption of photosynthetic reactions. Today, the mechanism of photoinhibition has become a major topic of photosynthesis research. It is generally accepted that PS II is affected predominantly by photoinhibition[(1)], which causes a loss of electron transfer capacity and oxygen evolution activity, bleaching of pigment, degradation of D-1 and other proteins, cross-linking between polypeptides([2,3]). Moreover, the damage of histidyl residues of D-1/D-2/cyt b559 complex under illumination has been first reported by our laboratory by using method of amino acid composition analysis[(4)]. It was speculated that histidyl residues binding with P680 were damaged because they were more easily attacked by intermediate and active oxygen generated during the charge separation and recombination in the D-1/D-2/cyt b559 complex due to their nearest distance to P680. However, up to now, the mechanism for photodamage of histidyl residues and their relationship with primary electron donor P680 remains unclear. Photodamage of histidyl residues is an important phenomenon. In this paper, PS II core complex was modified by diethyl-pyrocarbonate (DEPC), a histidyl modifier, so as to provide the information about the mechanism of photoinhibition.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0577-7496			WOS:000088115400017

Among the existing theories of the autotrophic origin of life in hydrothermal environments, CO2 is usually considered to be the carbon source for nascent autotrophic metabolism. However, the ancestral carbon used in metabolism may have been derived from CH4 if the outflow of magma fluid to the surface of the Earth consisted mainly of methane. In such an environment, the primary autotrophic metabolic systems had to be methanotrophic. Due to the absence of molecular oxygen in the Archean conditions, this metabolism would have been anaerobic; i.e., oxidation of methane must be realized by inorganic high-potential electron acceptors. In light of the primacy and prevalence of CH4-dependent metabolism in hydrothermal systems of the ancient Earth, we propose a model of carbon fixation where the methane is fixed or transformed in a sequence of reactions in an autocatalytic methane-fumarate cycle. Nitrogen oxides are thermodynamically the most favorable among possible oxidants of methane; however, even the activity of oxygen created by mineral buffers of iron in hydrothermal conditions is sufficient for methanotrophic acetogenesis. The hydrothermal system model is considered in the form of a phase diagram, which demonstrates the area of redox and P and T conditions favorable for the development of the primary methanotrophic metabolism.									3	1	0	0	1	0	4			1726-4170	1726-4189		WOS:000466419400002

However, the synthesis of SrTiO3 with controlled morphology, high surface area, and enhanced photocatalytic activity are still lacking. Herein, a series of porous SrTiO3 with well-controlled morphologies including assembled nanoparticles (ANPs), golf-like particles (GLPs), star-like microspheres (SLMs), urchin-like microspheres (ULMs), and flower-like microspheres (FLMs) were successfully prepared via an ethylene glycol-water mixed solvothermal route. The ratio of V-EG/V-H2O play an important role in the shape-evolution during the solvothermal reaction. A comparative study of photocatalytic H-2 production and photodegradation was performed, and a possible photocatalysis mechanism of SrTiO3 has been proposed. Significantly, the ULMs and FLMs photocatalysts of SrTiO3 with optimized low Pt loading amount (0.075 wt%) exhibited outstanding H-2 production rates (8.21 and 7.29 mmol g(-1) h(-1)) due to its unique structure of high-surface area and defect-rich surface. The facile and shape-controlled synthesis of varied SrTiO3 structures is believed to be useful for the design and application of perovskite. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

We conducted comparative gene expression profiling across a developmental time-course of fibers from G. longicalyx and G. herbaceum using microarrays with; 22,000 genes. Expression changes between stages were temporally protracted in G. herbaceum relative to G. longicalyx, reflecting a prolongation of the ancestral developmental program. Gene expression and GO analyses showed that many genes involved with stress responses were upregulated early in G. longicalyx fiber development. Several candidate genes upregulated in G. herbaceum have been implicated in regulating redox levels and cell elongation processes. Three genes previously shown to modulate hydrogen peroxide levels were consistently expressed in domesticated and wild cotton species with long fibers, but expression was not detected by quantitative real time-PCR in wild species with short fibers. Hydrogen peroxide is important for cell elongation, but at high concentrations it becomes toxic, activating stress processes that may lead to early onset of secondary cell wall synthesis and the end of cell elongation. These observations suggest that the evolution of long spinnable fibers in cotton was accompanied by novel expression of genes assisting in the regulation of reactive oxygen species levels. Our data suggest a model for the evolutionary origin of a novel morphology through differential gene regulation causing prolongation of an ancestral developmental program.									79	7	0	0	70	0	83			1553-7404			WOS:000255386100034	18248099	
J	Cordiner, M. A.; Charnley, S. B.								GAS-GRAIN MODELS FOR INTERSTELLAR ANION CHEMISTRY								ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL				749	2					120	10.1088/0004-637X/749/2/120				APR 2012	2012	Long-chain hydrocarbon anions CnH- (n = 4, 6, 8) have recently been found to be abundant in a variety of interstellar clouds. In order to explain their large abundances in the denser (prestellar/protostellar) environments, new chemical models are constructed that include gas-grain interactions. Models including accretion of gas-phase species onto dust grains and cosmic-ray-induced desorption of atoms are able to reproduce the observed anion-to-neutral ratios, as well as the absolute abundances of anionic and neutral carbon chains, with a reasonable degree of accuracy. Due to their destructive effects, the depletion of oxygen atoms onto dust results in substantially greater polyyne and anion abundances in high-density gas (with n(H2) greater than or similar to 10(5) cm(-3)). The large abundances of carbon-chain-bearing species observed in the envelopes of protostars such as L1527 can thus be explained without the need for warm carbon-chain chemistry. The C6H - anion-to-neutral ratio is found to be most sensitive to the atomic O and H abundances and the electron density. Therefore, as a core evolves, falling atomic abundances and rising electron densities are found to result in increasing anion-to-neutral ratios. Inclusion of cosmic-ray desorption of atoms in high-density models delays freeze-out, which results in a more temporally stable anion-to-neutral ratio, in better agreement with observations. Our models include reactions between oxygen atoms and carbon-chain anions to produce carbon-chain-oxide species C6O, C7O, HC6O, and HC7O, the abundances of which depend on the assumed branching ratios for associative electron detachment.									24	0	0	0	0	0	24			0004-637X	1538-4357		WOS:000302785700024

The geometry and the structure of the final skeletal nickel coatings can be manipulated by altering the time interval of the diffusion. In that way the actual electrochemical surface area and, thus, the electrocatalytic activity of the coatings towards HER and OER can be influenced. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) investigations, display that the electrocatalytic surface area increases in proportion to the thickness of the developed porous nickel structure.In the case of the HER, an increase in roughness factor (R-f) from 1 (for polished Ni) to 800, results in reduction of the hydrogen overpotential of 337 mV. When further increasing Re, up to above 2000, additional 40 mV are gained. For the OER, smaller roughness values were observed with the same activity trend as for the HER. The electrocatalyst are however found not to be stable in the anodic environment during electrolysis. The corrosion mechanism of a skeletal nickel electrocatalyst during the OER in an alkaline environment is briefly discussed.The structure and composition of the electrocatalysts are characterised by scanning electron microscopy and X-ray diffraction. The actual electrocatalytic surface area and the electrocatalytic behaviour are studied with potentiodynamic polarisation, CV and EIS. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Further understanding of catalysis in natural photosynthetics could benefit such technological developments. Photosynthetic organisms convert solar energy into NADPH and ATP (the biological fuels) through a process that is initiated at the oxygen evolving complex (OEC) of photosystem II (PSII). Such a catalytic site oxidizes water to generate the reducing equivalents for NADPH production and a pH gradient necessary for ATP biosynthesis. Water oxidation is a challenging four-electron reaction [2H(2)O -> O-2 + 4e(-) + 4H(+)] that is difficult to carry out efficiently in artificial photosynthetic systems. In this chapter, we review our recent studies of the OEC of PSII based on the recent X-ray diffraction model resolved at 1.9 angstrom resolution. We characterize the dark-adapted Si state of the OEC and address the potential functional role of chloride during O-2 evolution in PSII. These results are discussed in light of recent comparative studies on biomimetic oxomanganese complexes, revealing how Lewis base centers (such as carboxylate groups from the buffer solution, or surrounding environment) can play an important role as acid/base and redox cofactors in photosynthtetic water splitting. These findings have direct implications to catalytic water oxidation in photosystem II and provide useful information for the design of Mn-based biomimetic catalysts for artificial photosynthesis.

In this work, ultrathin TiO2 nanosheets were integrated into the growth of ZnIn2S4 to produce TiO2-ZnIn2S4 heterostructure nanoflowers. Both the matched energy band and (- )TiO2/(+)ZnIn2S4 internal electric field promote the formation of DZH. The prepared heterojunction holds the highest redox potential in the system, avoids the charge consumption from occurring in the electron mediator, and suppresses the recombination of photogenerated charges, leading to more separated electrons and holes. The formed DZH can consume residual photogenerated holes of ZnIn2S4 and enable water oxidation to occur solely at the TiO2 site, improving the overall stability of the system. The optimized DZH nanoflowers show enhanced PWS activity (214.9 mu mol g-1 h-1 for H2 evolution and 81.7 mu mol g-1 h-1 for O2 evolution without any cocatalyst and sacrificial agent) and excellent stability (50 h).									58	3	0	0	6	0	58			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000663287600006

Numerous noble metal-free catalysts have been developed with excellent catalytic performance for cathodic oxygen reduction reaction in AEMFCs. However, the anodic catalysts for hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR) still rely on noble metal materials. Since the kinetics of HOR in alkaline media is 2-3 orders of magnitude lower than that in acidic media, it is a major challenge to either improve the performance of noble metal catalysts or to develop high-performance noble metal-free catalysts. Additionally, the mechanisms of alkaline HOR are not yet clear and still under debate, further hampering the design of electrocatalysts. Against this backdrop, this review starts with the prevailing theories for alkaline HOR on the basis of diverse activity descriptors, i.e., hydrogen binding energy theory and bifunctional theory. The design principles and recent advances of HOR catalysts employing the aforementioned theories are then summarized. Next, the strategies and recent progress in improving the antioxidation capability of HOR catalysts, a thorny issue which has not received sufficient attention, are discussed. Moreover, the significance of correlating computational models with real catalyst structure and the electrode/electrolyte interface is further emphasized. Lastly, the remaining controversies about the alkaline HOR mechanisms as well as the challenges and possible research directions in this field are presented.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			1936-0851	1936-086X		WOS:000813143100001	35420784

Review of electrochemical production of doped graphene for energy storage applications								JOURNAL OF ENERGY STORAGE				46						103527	10.1016/j.est.2021.103527				FEB 2022	2022	Graphene has been investigated and studied over the years due to its exceptional electrical, thermal, quantum and optical properties. A low-cost, simple, and environmentally friendly method to produce graphene is of great importance and such a method is required to fully exploit its physical and chemical properties for various applications. The present review reports the recent progress and developments on efficient methods for graphene synthesis, focusing primarily on the electrochemical exfoliation of graphite in inorganic salts or aqueous acids, assessing the method capabilities for mass production of doped electrochemically exfoliated graphene (EEG) for energy storage applications. A facile electrochemical exfoliation of graphite is typically carried out in a parallel two-electrode electrolytic cell system with aqueous inorganic salt-based electrolytes under ambient conditions. The nature of the EEG can be easily tuned by controlling the exfoliation conditions. Furthermore, the qualities of the graphene produced from the electrochemical exfoliation method using different electrolytes and setup parameters were reviewed comprehensively, regarding yield, chemical and physical properties (i.e., the morphology (layers and lateral size distribution), the nature and concentration of doped heterogeneous atoms, temperature stability, the degree of disorder, carbon/oxygen ratio, electrical conductivity (or sheet resistance), and the electrochemical performance in energy storage applications. Heteroatom doped EEG presents great promise for future design and large-scale production of affordable and high-performance composite electrodes for energy storage devices, e.g., hybrid supercapacitors, batteries, and full cells.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4				2352-152X		WOS:000774010600001

This study aims to improve the mechanical properties of the titanium surface. A new surface modification process for titanium is proposed, wherein Ar is used to dilute O-2 and laser gas oxidizing is performed on the titanium surface in this dilute O-2 environment. The feasibility of this process was verified at different O-2/Ar gas flow ratios. The evolution of the molten pool generated by laser irradiation was analyzed using a high-speed camera combined with a welding glass filter. The surface and cross-section of the modified layer were observed by scanning electron microscopy and X-ray diffraction to study its forming characteristics. The microhardness was characterized, and friction and wear tests were carried out to study the properties of the modified layer. The experiments proved that diluting O-2 with Ar can reduce the rate of the reaction between O-2 and titanium and enhance the process controllability; therefore, laser gas oxidizing of the titanium surface in a dilute O-2 environment is feasible. The O-2 to Ar gas flow ratio significantly affected the process controllability, as well as the surface roughness, number of cracks, microhardness, and wear resistance of the modified layer. With a moderate O-2 to Ar gas flow ratio, optimal formation and performance of the modified layer can be achieved. The oxygen content and hardness below the modified layer were lower than those of the modified layer; however, they higher than those of commercially-pure titanium.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0257-8972	1879-3347		WOS:000697567600023

However, large-scale implementation of PEC water splitting is now hampered by insufficient solar-to-hydrogen conversion efficiency, which requires the development of high-performance photoelectrodes. Key processes that determine the water splitting performance of photoelectrodes are the light absorption, separation, and transport efficiency of photogenerated electrons and holes and the surface reaction of water oxidation/reduction. Concerning these three key processes, various material design and surface/interface engineering strategies have been explored to improve the performance of photoelectrodes. Herein, these strategies for photoelectrode optimization of the past decades are summarized and discussed in terms of micro- and nanostructuring, heterojunction construction, element doping, surface passivation, plasmonic metal coating, and electrocatalyst modification. Special attention is given to how these strategies play their roles in improving the performance of photoelectrodes, based on which it is hoped light is shed on the design principles and modification routes for high-performance photoelectrodes.									12	1	0	0	0	0	12			2367-198X			WOS:000626161600001

Here we report a systematic investigation of particle size effect of hydrogen oxidation and evolution reaction (HOR/HER) on carbon supported Pd nanoparticles with sizes ranging from 3 to 42 nm in both acidic and alkaline electrolytes using rotating disk electrode (RDE) method. Similar particle size effect was obtained in both acid and base: the HOR/HER activity in terms of specific exchange current density increases as Pd particle size increases from 3 to 19 nm, and then reaches a plateau with activity similar to that of bulk Pd. The enhanced activity with rising particle size could be attributed to the increased ratio of the sites with weaker hydrogen binding energy revealed in cyclic voltammograms (CVs). Pd catalysts with different Pd particle sizes all showed much higher HOR/HER activity in acid than in base, which is largely attributed to their smaller hydrogen binding energy in acid evidenced by the lower potential of the underpotential deposited hydrogen (H-upd) peak in CVs as well as the smaller activation energy in acid.

Herein, based on first-principles calculations, we demonstrate that the two-dimensional beta-PdSe2 monolayer is a promising candidate for efficient photocatalytic water splitting in acidic and alkaline media as well as neutral medium with highly efficient solar-to-hydrogen efficiency. beta-PdSe2 monolayer shows low cleavage energy which endorses the possibility of its mechanical exfoliation from layered bulk beta-PdSe2. Remarkably, beta-PdSe2 monolayer is semiconducting with indirect band gap of 1.96 eV with perfect engulfing the redox potential of water in a wide range of pH of medium. beta-PdSe2 monolayer exhibits good light harvesting ability and adequate driving forces for water redox reaction in wide range of pH (0 to 12). Comprehensive investigation of pH dependent water splitting indicates that the beta-PdSe2 monolayer is a better candidate for efficient water splitting in alkaline media rather than acidic or neutral medium. In addition, high solar-to-hydrogen efficiency as high as similar to 17% is obtained that shows beta-PdSe2 monolayer a promising candidate for overall photocatalytic water-splitting.									7	0	0	0	0	0	7			2044-4753	2044-4761		WOS:000692362400001

The model was calibrated with data for Ni- and Mn-ferntes taken from the literature. We demonstrate that the lattice parameter of a NixFe3-O-x(4)-(delta) spinel can be predicted within a precision of 0.01 A. This model was used to monitor the value of x and delta of NixFe3-(x)0(4)-(delta) nanopowders (with initial x = 0, 0.25, 0.5, and l) during reactive in situ X-ray diffraction H-2 reduction and C0(2) oxidation at 400 degrees C. Results show that H-2 reduction occurs in two steps: (i) transition from a gamma-type (delta < 0) to a regular (delta approximate to 0) spinel and (ii) preferential reduction of nickel from the spinel lattice to form a (Ni,Fe) solid solution. The face-centered cubic configuration for this alloy is favored in cases of high initial contents of nickel (x = 0.5, l), and body-centered cubic for samples with low initial nickel content (x = 0, 0.25, 0.5). A subsequent CO2 reoxidation of the samples shows that the process is partly reversible: iron will first be preferentially reintegrated into the lattice, and the initial excess of oxygen will be partially replenished. In addition to providing a thorough description of the phases and their evolution during reaction, these results describe the thermochemical behavior of nonstoichiometric nickel ferrites for the first time.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			1932-7447			WOS:000433403400041

The last two samples have a sufficiently low iron concentration to be considered true catalysts (i.e., having Fe dilutions as low as that used in the industrial conversion of benzene to phenol (Si/Fe > 80)) in partial oxidation reactions. A systematic spectroscopic study is presented in order to obtain a global picture of a system whose complexity can be understood by assuming the formation of a wide variety of transient coordinatively unsaturated iron species, with different oxidation states, which ultimately lead to grafted or anchored isolated and/or clustered species by interaction with residual tetrahedral Si(OH)Fe, defective SiOH groups, or strained SiOSi bridges of the hosting matrix. The structure characterization was obtained by means of the parallel use of IR, X-ray absorption near-edge spectroscopy, and electron paramagnetic resonance techniques, before, during, and after interaction with CO, N2O, and NO probe molecules. This approach was applied to samples characterized by different iron content, activation temperature, and redox treatments. This allowed us to throw light onto structure, oxidation state, and mutual interconversion of a very complex family of extraftamework iron species. Oxidation with O-2 or N2O led to the formation of strongly bonded oxygen. species. The relation between these species and the so-called alpha-oxygen species, claimed as the active sites for the hydroxylation of benzene to phenol by N2O, is discussed.

Elsewhere in the remnant, we see silicon rich ejecta from explosive oxygen burning. The Fe-rich ejecta lie outside the Si-rich material, indicating that bulk motions were extensive and energetic enough in Cas A to cause a spatial inversion of a significant portion of the supernova core. It is likely that this inversion was caused by "Fe"-rich ejecta emerging in plumes from the rising bubbles in the neutrino-driven convection layer during the supernova explosion. In addition, the radioactive decay energy from Ni-56 may have contributed to the subsequent evolution of the material. We have also discovered faint, well-defined filaments with featureless X-ray spectra that are possibly sites of cosmic-ray acceleration in Cas A.									269	3	0	0	1	0	270			0004-637X			WOS:000085210700014	10600630

In this study, hierarchical zigzag-like phosphorus doped CuCo2O4 nanosheets based 3D electrode materials were successfully synthesized via a hydrothermal method and followed by thermal treatment. Since the unique morphology of 2D nanosheets with zigzag-like edges could provide more reactive sites, which is not only conducive to the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), but also conducive to the electrochemical energy storage. Meanwhile, the doping of phosphorus was adopted to improve the conductivity, which would further enhance the electrochemical properties of CuCo2O4. Thereafter, its performance for HER and SCs in 1 M KOH were systematically investigated. As an electrode for HER, it only required a low overpotential of 152 mV to reach 10 mA cm-2 with a Tafel slope of 115.7 mV dec-1. Furthermore, I-t test result showed an excellent stability. As an electrode for SCs, it exhibited a high specific capacity of 896.9C g-1at 1 A g-1 in three-electrode system. All in all, the obtained hierarchical zigzag-like phosphorus doped CuCo2O4 nanosheets provided a feasible route for the design of bi-functional electrode materials both for energy conversion and storage.

Modified electrodes GC-1-GC-3 were prepared with films of 1-3 deposited on glassy carbon and evaluated as potential hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) catalysts. HER studies in 0.5 M aqueous H2SO4 (10 mA cm(-2)) revealed dramatic shifts in the overpotential from 0.740 to 0.450 V after extended cycling for 1 and 2. The charge-transfer resistances for GC-1-GC-3 were determined to be 270, 160, and 630 Omega, respectively. Characterization of the modified surfaces for GC-1 and GC-2 by scanning electron microscopy and Raman spectroscopy revealed similar crystalline coatings before HER that changed to surface-modified crystallites after conditioning. The surface of GC-3 had an initial glasslike appearance before HER that delaminated after HER The differences in the surface morphology and the effect of conditioning are correlated with crystal-packing effects.

Conversion of CO2 into useful fuels along with rechargeable metal air batteries and water splitting is one way to combat the energy crisis, which is bottlenecked due to the lack of multifunctional electrocatalyst. Herein simple but multifunctional electrocatalyst, which combined CoNi nanoalloy, N-doped carbon nanotubes, and single atomic Ni sites together is reported. The prepared electrocatalyst has shown remarkable performance for CO2RR, ORR, OER, and HER. The practical utilization of the catalyst is mansifested by a dual model metal CO2/air battery and water electrolyzer. An excellent CO2RR with FE of 99% is achieved in 0.5 M KHCO3 medium. The catalyst exhibits more positive onset (0.98 V) and half wave potential (0.86 V) than Pt/C for ORR, extremely low overpotential (eta(10)) of 250 mV for OER, and thus the lowest ORR/OER potential gap of 0.62 V. In alkaline medium, the catalyst also shows excellent HER performance with eta(10) of 49 mV, resulting in the smallest cell bias of 1.57 V for overall water splitting to date. This work provides a new pathway to design more stellar multifunctional electrocatalyst for sustainable and clean renewable energy technology.									10	0	0	0	0	0	10			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000537394100062	32388972

Herein, a photo-catalytic system composed of NixP/biocarbon composite as reactive center and erythrosine B (ErB) as sensitizer was constructed for the removal of sulfamethoxazole (SMX) antibiotic under visible light irradiation. NixP/ biocarbon composites were fabricated via a facile impregnation-pyrolysis approach using baker's yeast as both phosphorus and carbon precursor. It was found that NixP with pure Ni12P5, almost pure Ni2P or mixed crystal phases could be obtained by simply adjusting Ni:P molar ratio in precursor and pyrolysis temperature. Inter-estingly, the variation of NixP crystal phases remarkably affected photocatalytic removal efficiency of SMX. The obtained NixP(1:4)- 900 sample with mixed phases of Ni12P5 and Ni2P displayed excellent photodegradation performance with 98.71% removal efficiency for SMX (C-0 = 20 mg L-1) in ErB-sensitized photocatalytic system. Moreover, the reusability of NixP/biocarbon composite was confirmed by four consecutive runs. The slight loss of activity in recycle study could be fully recovered after thermal regeneration. Further investigation indicated that photo-generated electrons from excited ErB molecules could be transferred to NixP/biocarbon, triggering a series of reactions to form various reactive oxygen species (eg., center dot & nbsp;O-2(-), H2O2, center dot & nbsp;OH) for SMX degradation. The better photocatalytic activity of NixP mixed crystal phases should be ascribed to its faster electron transfer ability. Overall, this study provides useful guidance in terms of the development of transition metal phosphide and efficient photocatalytic system.& nbsp;									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			2213-2929	2213-3437		WOS:000793200500008

Herein, we report an evaluation of a series of heteroatom-doped graphene materials as oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) catalysts with the aid of density functional theory (DFT) calculations. The results of the DFT calculations indicate that the intrinsic catalytic activity and the ORR mechanism depend on the triple effect, that is, the charge, the spin density and the coordinate state (ligand effect) of the carbon sites. The contribution of the above effects towards increasing the binding energies of *OOH or *OH has the following order: negative charge effect < positive charge effect < low spin effect < ligand effect < high spin effect. For nonmetallic single-heteroatom-doped-G, the triple effect separately activates the carbon sites around the doped atom. On each single carbon active site, only the end-on adsorption of *OOH is preferred, leading to the ORR following the associative mechanism, which has an intrinsic limitation in its overpotential of 0.44 V. However, for metal-doped-G and dual-heteroatom-doped-G, the triple effect can activate double carbon sites, and lead to the ORR following the dissociative mechanism, which breaks through the activity limitation of the associative mechanism, and further enhances the catalytic activity for the ORR. With comprehensive theoretical calculation, we conclude that it is possible for the heteroatom-doped-G, if well-modulated via the triple effect, to exceed Pt-based materials in catalysis of the ORR.									81	3	0	0	4	0	81			2041-6520	2041-6539		WOS:000437467400013	30079190

The polycrystalline powders consist of lath-shaped crystallites, tens of nanometres in maximum dimension. Powder neutron diffraction shows that the materials have an expanded a axis and contracted c axis compared to the parent RuO2, but there is no evidence of lowering of symmetry to other AO(2)-type structures, supported by Raman spectroscopy. Rietveld refinement shows no evidence for oxide non-stoichiometry and provides a formula (MxRu1-x)O-2 with 0.14 < x < 0.2, depending on the substituent metal. This is supported by energy-dispersive X-ray analysis on the transmission electron microscope, while Ru K-edge XANES spectroscopy shows that upon inclusion of the substituent the average Ru oxidation state is increased to balance charge. Variable temperature magnetic measurements provide evidence for atomic homogeneity of the mixed metal materials, with suppression of the high temperature antiferromagnetism of RuO2 and increased magnetic moment. The new rutiles all show enhanced electrocatalysis compared to reference RuO2 materials for oxygen evolution in 1 M H2SO4 electrolyte at 60 degrees C, with higher specific and mass activity (per Ru) than a low surface area crystalline RuO2 and with less Ru dissolution over 1000 cycles compared to an RuO2 with a similar surface area. Magnesium substitution provides the optimum balance between stability and activity, despite leaching of the Mg2+ into solution, and this was proved in membrane electrode assemblies.									7	0	0	0	0	0	7			0897-4756	1520-5002		WOS:000557753300023

These included short-term high PAR (1600 mu mol m(-2) s(-1)) which was given for 4 h either alone or in combination with an enhanced level of UV-B-BE radiation (4.6 kJ m(-2) h(-1) biologically effective UV-B, 280-320 nm), Recovery from the radiation treatment was studied for 4 h under the light conditions for growth. Since it is known that the atrazine-tolerant mutant is susceptible to photoinhibition, one of the aims of the present study was to determine the effects of a supplemental, enhanced level of UV-B radiation with regard to the mutant, The results indicate an additive effect of UV-B radiation on F-v/F-m, photochemical yield and photosynthetic oxygen evolution during both exposure and recovery, and also a higher susceptibility of the mutant to photoinhibitory PAR conditions alone and in combination with UV-B, which may have implications in a changing environment. Both cultivars also showed a higher D1 turnover during the radiation stress than during recovery, as shown by immunoblotting and S-35-methionine incorporation measurements.									25	2	1	0	22	1	29			0022-0957	1460-2431		WOS:000085380200012	10938832

Herein, piezocatalytic water splitting and degradation of organic pollutants have been realized in three few-layer transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) (namely MoS2, WS2, and WSe2). We showed that the H-2 evolution rate reached 29.1, 15.4, and 11.3 mu mol g(-1) h(-1) for MoS2, WS2, and WSe2 nanosheets respectively, under mechanical force provided by ultrasonic vibration. Moreover, their piezocatalytic activities can be further promoted by loading with heavy metal (e.g. Pt and Au) nanoparticles. In addition, all the samples exhibited good piezocatalytic degradation efficiency and reusability toward different organic pollutants (e.g. tetracycline and Rhodamine B). We also provided a systematic investigation on the piezoelectricity by piezoresponse force microscopy and piezoelectric stress coefficients (e(11)) by first-principle calculations of these three studied compounds, which are accordant with the piezocatalytic results. The present work clearly demonstrates a high correlation between piezoelectricity and mechanical vibration induced catalytic reactions in few-layer TMDs and may provide insight into the mechanisms of piezocatalytic effect.									93	3	0	0	13	0	93			2211-2855	2211-3282		WOS:000503062400005

Here we rationally, atomistically design and synthesize the hetero-interfaced Ni-Co phosphide nanowires which deliver exceptional activity and stability in water electrolysis under industry-relevant current densities. The compositional and crystallographic design produces extra-stable Ni5P4-Co2P nanowires sprouting from a Ni-Co alloy foam (NCF). The extraordinary reactivity is ensured by the heterointerfaces between the highly-active (303) crystal planes of Co2P and Ni5P4 nanowire phases. The overpotentials of Ni5P4-Co2P/NCF catalysts at-10,-100, and-1000 mA cm(-2) are about 21, 92 and 267 mV in 1 M KOH, respectively, far exceeding the commercial Pt/C catalysts. The Tafel slope of Ni5P4-Co2P/NCF catalyst is only 23 mV dec(-1) , indicating an even faster HER kinetic compared to Pt/C (32 mV dec(-1)). Moreover, the Ni5P4-Co2P/NCF catalyst shows an ultra stable and lasting performance, evidenced by only a minor 3.6% drop at j250 after 100 h continuing operation. The DFT calculations confirm that the exposed heterointerfaces between (303) planes of Ni5P4 and Co2P phases play a key role for boosting the HER activity of Ni5P4-Co2P electrocatalyst.									7	0	0	0	1	0	7			2211-2855	2211-3282		WOS:000781820300004

It provides element-specific contrast images that allows the study of the surface morphology and the identification of the various components of the composite electrode. It also enables the acquisition of local X-ray absorption spectra (XAS) on single particles of the electrode, such as the C and O K-edges to track the stability of carbonate-based electrolytes, F K-edge to study the electrolyte salt and binder stability, and the transition metal L-edges to gain insights into the oxidation/reduction processes of positive and negative active materials. Here we discuss the optimal measurement conditions for XPEEM studies of Li-ion battery systems, including (i) electrode preparation through mechanical pressing to reduce surface roughness for improved spatial resolution; (ii) corrections of the XAS spectra at the C K-edge to remove the carbon signal contribution originating from the X-ray optics; and (iii) procedures for minimizing the effect of beam damage. Examples from our recent work are provided to demonstrate the strength of XPEEM to solve challenging interface reaction mechanisms via post mortem measurements. Finally, we present a first XPEEM cell dedicated to operando/in situ experiments in all-solid-state batteries. Representative measurements were carried out on a graphite electrode cycled with LiI-incorporated sulfide-based electrolyte. This measurement demonstrates the strong competitive reactions between the lithiated graphite surface and the Li2O formation caused by the reaction of the intercalated lithium with the residual oxygen in the vacuum chamber. Moreover, we show the versatility of the operando XPEEM cell to investigate other active materials, for example, Li4Ti5O12.									11	1	0	0	0	0	12			0003-2700	1520-6882		WOS:000514758900021	31961659	
J	Spiegel, S; Bader, KP								Interaction of quaternary ammonium and phosphonium salts with photosynthetic membranes								ZEITSCHRIFT FUR NATURFORSCHUNG SECTION C-A JOURNAL OF BIOSCIENCES				56	11-12			1057	1066						NOV-DEC 2001	2001	Distinct concentration ranges of selected quaternary ammonium and phosphonium salts were elaborated to induce stimulatory or inhibitory effects, respectively, on photosynthetic reactions. By means of fluorescence induction measurements 3 different effects of alkylbenzyldimethylammonium chloride (ABDAC; zephirol) in chloroplast preparations from Pisum sativum were observed. 60 muM ABDAC produced a strong increase in F-max with concurrently improved Kautsky kinetics. Increased ABDAC concentration (500 muM) led to a strong fluorescence quenching - virtually indistinguishable from the conditions following the addition of photosystem II electron acceptors like K3Fe[CN](6). Further increase of ABDAC to 5 mm provoked a drastic increase in the fluorescence yield together with the complete loss of any detectable kinetics. We suggest a 3-step interaction of ABDAC with the thylakoid membranes of photosynthetic organisms similar to our earlier discussion (Bader and Hoper (1993), Z. Naturforsch. 49 c, 87-94). We examined a series of derivatives with selectively modified side chains, central atoms and counter ions, respectively. Both an alkyl chain of the type ([-CH2-](n); n similar to > 10) and effective polar components are indispensable for the adsorption and intercalation of the molecule onto and into the thylakoid membranes. The benzyl group could be replaced by a methyl residue without any loss of effectiveness; replacement of the central nitrogen (N) by phosphorus (P) and the counter ion Cl by Br did not modify the effects and the results were indistinguishable from the ABDAC effect proper. Shortening of the alkyl chain to (-CH2-)(6) resulted in a less effective interaction of e.g. tetraoctylammonium bromide with the photosynthetic membrane. Flash-induced oxygen evolution measurements with selected derivatives (15 muM) substantiated our interpretation of an improved OEC functioning by a substantial lowering of the miss parameter a and the exclusion of a chemical reduction as the standard S-state distribution was not affected. As evidenced by both SDS-PAGE and Western blot analyses the investigated molecules showed a direct interaction. The polypeptide patterns were characterized by a severe shift of the molecular weight components from high (20-67 kDa) to low (< 20 kDa) values.									2	0	0	0	1	0	2			0939-5075	1865-7125		WOS:000173761900024	11837658

The 20% 2D-C3N4/Ag3VO4 showed the best photocatalytic activity on the degradation of RhB and BPA. The enhanced photocatalytic activity is ascribed to the effective electron-hole separation efficiency and the larger specific surface area. The photogenerated electrons and holes can quickly separate by Z-scheme passageway in composite. Through ESR analysis, the photocatalytic mechanism was also researched in detail.									16	0	0	0	1	0	16			1862-6300	1862-6319		WOS:000403339900021

The synthesized materials viz., n-Pd@NDCDs and NDCDs were duly characterized by high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM), Raman spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR). The optical properties of NDCDs were studied by ultraviolet visible (UV-Vis), and fluorescence spectroscopy techniques. Further, the electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) performance of n-Pd@NDCDs was evaluated by linear sweep voltammetry (LSV), Tafel, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements in 0.5 M aqueous H2SO4. The onset potential of n-Pd@NDCDs was about -0.195 V-RHE, which was lower than NDCDS (-0.392 V-RHE) and bare glassy carbon (-0.603 V-RHE). The calculated Tafel slope values of n-Pd@NDCDs were 135 and 141.8 mV/dec, from the voltammetric and EIS methods, respectively. Moreover, the n-Pd@NDCDs exhibited small overpotential of 0.291 V to attain a current density of 10 mA/cm(2). The EIS studies revealed that the HER charge transfer resistance was dropped from 84.3 to 18.3 Omega/cm(2) while increasing of potential, which revealed good conductivity and electrocatalytic activity of n-Pd@NDCDs. Thus the present work vouched for the candidature of n-Pd@NDCDs as an effective electrocatalyst for the HER in acidic medium. (C) 2020 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Here, ultrathin BP nanosheets were prepared through organic salt sodium citrate assisted exfoliation of bulk BP. Further, an efficient photoelectrode for photoelectrochemical water splitting was developed based on TiO2 nanorod arrays, coated with ultrathin black phosphorus nanosheets. Compared to the pure TiO2 nanorod arrays, this structure exhibits reduced photoluminescent emission, longer carrier lifetime, and a strong photocurrent density enhancement of about 140 %. The high photoelectrochemical performance indicated the formed 2D-1D BP/TiO2 heterostructure facilitates the charge separation and transfer. The interfacial interactions between black phosphorus and TiO2 were thoroughly investigated with XPS and FTIR spectroscopy.									16	1	0	0	1	0	16			2196-0216			WOS:000496881700001

The films were formed on platinum electrodes from the monomer and tetrabutylammonium hexafluorophosphate, tetrabutylammonium tetrafluoroborate, or tetraethylammonium perchlorate in acetonitrile. Results were also discussed with the aid of X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), electron probe microanalysis (EPMA), and primarily by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). It was shown that there is some oxygen contamination not only after ClO4, doping. However, it was shown by XPS and EPMA that C-O-C bonds are present in the films, which confirmed that there was no destruction of the furan ring during electropolymerization. SEM study showed film morphology evolution with monomer concentration, and with the electrolyte or the dopant used. The undoping effect was also visualized, showing that doped polyfuran was more homogeneous than the respective undoped deposits.

Under simulated light irradiation, the photocurrent density of the resulting N-CDs@alpha-Fe2O3/Ti as a photoanode exhibits a 3.4 times increase with a 280 mV cathode shift of the onset potential relative to that of pristine alpha-Fe2O3/Ti, with excellent photostability. The up-conversion fluorescent properties of N-CDs enable the absorption of longer wavelength irradiation with emission of short wavelength light to excite alpha-Fe2O3, leading to the generation of more electron-hole pairs.									72	5	0	0	9	0	73			2052-1553			WOS:000398182200016

Two-dimensional (2D) semiconductors hold significant promise because of their large surface area compared to bulk photocatalysts. To overcome the crucial problem of the short lifetime of photogenerated charges, 2D van der Waals (vdW) heterostructures are being considered due to their awesome ability to separate photogenerated electrons and holes. This review summarizes the state-of-the-art studies on the topic of 2D photocatalysts, especially vdW heterostructure, for water splitting. After demonstrating the fundamental concepts of the light-driven redox reaction for water splitting, we discuss a number of promising 2D vdW heterostructures, highlighting the transition metal dichalcogenides and phosphorene based heterostructures, from both theoretical and experimental insights. Finally, we discuss the opportunities and challenges in this area of investigation. This article presents the advanced understanding of 2D vdW heterostructures in photocatalysis, which provides new opportunities for improving the efficiency of hydrogen generation from water splitting.									23	0	0	0	0	0	23				2399-1984		WOS:000568385600001

It has been shown that the formation of a polymeric transfer film is crucial to achieving ultralow wear on a metal countersurface. However, the detailed chemical mechanism of transfer film formation and its role in the exceptional wear performance has yet to be described. There has been much debate about the role of chemical interactions between the PTFE, the filler, and the metal countersurface, and some researchers have even concluded that chemical changes are not an important part of the ultralow wear mechanism in these materials. Here, a stripe test allowed detailed spectroscopic studies of PTFE/alpha-alumina transfer films in various stages of development, which led to a proposed mechanism which accounts for the creation of chemically distinct films formed on both surfaces of the wear couple. PTFE chains are broken during sliding and undergo a series of reactions to produce carboxylate chain ends, which have been shown to chelate to both the metal surface and to the surface of the alumina filler particles. These tribochemical reactions form a robust polymer-on-polymer system that protects the steel countersurface and is able to withstand hundreds of thousands of cycles of sliding with almost no wear of the polymer composite after the initial run-in period. The mechanical scission of carboncarbon bonds in the backbone of PTFE under conditions of sliding contact is supported mathematically using the Hamaker model for van der Waals interactions between polymer fibrils and the countersurface. The necessity for ambient moisture and oxygen is explained, and model experiments using small molecules confirm the reactions in the proposed mechanism.									158	11	6	0	3	0	169			0024-9297	1520-5835		WOS:000356201100038

Two well defined 1-e(-) redox systems are observed related to Co2+/Co3+ and Co3+/Co4+ reactions of non-equivalent oxide surface sites. Oxide stoichiometry is directly estimated by voltammetry in 'wet' conditions and depends on preparation temperature as in ex situ solid state data. Adsorption of surface intermediates involved in charge transfer is examined. Langmuir and Temkin-type adsorption isotherms are obeyed for the Co2+/Co3+ and Co3+/Co4+ redox systems, respectively. Unusually negative (attractive) lateral interaction parameters are calculated for the latter system. Separation of oxide and graphite currents is achieved to permit real electrode surface area determination. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science S.A.

Here, we cloned the complete cDNA of cytoglobin 1 and 2 (Cygb1 and Cygb2) from S. pylzovi and then investigated transcriptional changes of both genes in the selected tissues in response to hypoxia. Both the two genes had the standard exon-intron structure of vertebrate Mb genes but lacked an exon at downstream of the H helix (HC11.2) as seen in mammals. We applied severe hypoxia (4h at PO2=3.6% saturation) and moderate hypoxia (72h at PO2=36.0% saturation) to adult S. pylzovi. Under severe hypoxia, the Cygb1 mRNA levels decreased significantly in the liver, kidney, and brain, but increased significantly in the heart, while the Cygb2 mRNA levels downregulated significantly in the muscle and liver. But, the transcriptional activity of Cygb1 in muscle and that of Cygb2 in the kidney, brain, and heart remained almost unchanged. Under moderate hypoxia, the transcriptional activities of both genes in muscle and brain were turned down quickly after onset hypoxia, while in the liver, kidney, and heart, the transcriptional activities of both genes showed a short-term upregulation in different time periods of hypoxia exposure. Our data suggest that both the Cygb1 and Cygb2 in S. pylzovi are hypoxia-induced genes, and the responses of the transcription regulation of Cygb1 and Cygb2 genes to hypoxia are tissue specific and also depend on the hypoxia regime, which are different from that of other fish species.									4	1	0	0	5	0	5			0920-1742	1573-5168		WOS:000474354700003	30406573

In the SLRFB, lead metal and lead dioxide are plated on the negative and positive electrodes from a single electrolyte reservoir containing soluble lead(II) species. Although the membrane-less cell configuration bestows SLRFB cost-effectiveness over other flow batteries, there are challenges associated with the plating of PbO2, Pb dendrite formation and the presence of parasitic reactions. This review mainly focuses on the present status and major challenges of the SLRFB. The solutions to prevent the dendritic growth of Pb metal, accelerate the redox kinetics of Pb2+/PbO2 redox couple, and suppress the oxygen evolution at cathode have been discussed in detail. The role of electrolyte concentration, electrolyte additives, current density, charging time and temperature on the phase change and surface morphology of the PbO2 electrodeposit has been extensively reviewed. Besides, the modification to the electrolyte in terms of the additive chemistry improving the electrochemical performance and cycle life of SLRFB has been discussed in this review. Finally, the aspects of cell design on improving the performance at a lab-scale as well as stack level are highlighted.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0013-4651	1945-7111		WOS:000787511900001

Mn(II), (III) and (IV) ions are present in the structure, and, thus, the electrochemistry of the solid is very complicated. Herein, the cyclic voltammetry of nanolayered Mn oxides in the presence of LiClO4 at pH = 6.3, under different conditions, was studied using scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction and visible spectroelectrochemistry. The scan rates, calcination temperatures and the range of the cyclic voltammetry have very important effects on the electrochemistry of nanolayered Mn oxides. The effect of the use of D2O instead of H2O on the electrochemistry of nanolayered Mn oxides was also considered. Such nanolayered Mn oxides were reported as water-oxidizing catalysts in the presence of cerium(IV) ammonium nitrate. As a next step, we studied the cyclic voltammetry of nanolayered Mn oxides under acidic conditions and in the presence of cerium(IV) ammonium nitrate.									22	0	0	0	2	0	21			2044-4753	2044-4761		WOS:000407636600010

Intense electrostatic hydration of charged combustible nanoparticles converts the nanoparticle's oxide-based shells into the hydroxide-based electrolyte shells, transforming these nanoparticles into reductant/air core-shell nanobatteries, periodically short-circuited by intraparticle field and thermionic emission. Partially synchronized electron emission breakdowns within trillions of nanoparticles-nanobatteries turn a cloud of charged nanoparticles-nanobatteries into a powerful radiofrequency aerosol generator. Electrostatic oxidative hydration and charge-catalyzed oxidation of charged combustible nanoparticles also contribute to a self-oscillating thermocycling process of evolution and periodic autoignition of inflammable gases near to the nanoparticle's surface. The described effects might be of interest for the improvement of certain nanotechnological heterophase processes and to better understand ball lightning phenomenon.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			1687-4110	1687-4129		WOS:000289094000001

The addition of metals such as Ru or Ni increases the oxophilicity of the Pd surface, as observed from the shifting of the Pd oxide reduction peaks. As a consequence, the onset potential for the electrooxidation of ethanol shifts to less positive values on the bimetallic catalysts. The nature and evolution of the species formed during the electrooxidation of ethanol over the catalysts under study has been monitored using in situ infrared spectroscopy. In order to assess properly the evolution of the species formed during the electrooxidation of ethanol, infrared spectra have been recorded in both H2O and D2O electrolytes. The results presented in this work demonstrate that the scission of the C-C bond of ethanol takes place at the surface of Pd/C and PdM/C (M = Ni and Ru) at potentials as low as 30 mV. However, at potentials above E >= 400 mV, acetates are the main species formed during the electrooxidation of ethanol. (C) 2019 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Solar hydrogen is the pillar of this new green economy, but the technological readiness level of PV electrolysis and direct photoelectrochemical (PEC) electrolysis are still too low to allow broad commercialization. Direct conversion through PEC technology has more potential in the medium-long term but must be first guided by the scientific enhancements to improve device efficiencies. For this purpose, in situ and operando photoelectrochemistry will guide the discovery of new materials and processes to make solar fuels and chemicals in PEC cells.The use of advanced in situ and operando characterizations under working photoelectrochemical (PEC) conditions is reviewed here and anticipated to be a fundamental tool for achieving a basic understanding of new PEC processes and for enabling the large-scale development of PEC technology by 2050, thus delivering fuels and chemicals having zero (or negative) carbon footprint. Hydrogen from solar water splitting is the most popular solar fuel and can be mainly produced by indirect photovoltaic-driven electrolysis (PV electrolysis) and direct photoelectrochemistry. Although PV electrolysis has already been developed on a level of MW-scale pilot plants, PEC technology, which is much less mature, holds several advantages in the long term over PVelectrolysis systems. The key enabling feature to developing PEC technology is the improvement of the photoelectrode materials which are responsible for the absorption of light, and transport of the photo-generated charge carriers to drive the electrochemical surface reaction. These processes are often complex and multistep, spanning multiple timescales and following the simultaneous detection of photoelectrodes modification and formation of reaction intermediates/products can be achieved using eight well-known characterization techniques here presented.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			2329-2229	2329-2237		WOS:000584392000001

There exists a group of processing methodologies by which np-M are formed through a top-down nanostructure evolution driven by the selective removal of a sacrificial component, all of which are a variation of dealloying. Nanoporosity evolution through current dealloying methodologies, however, is governed by strict requirements including sufficient separation in "reactivity" of the participating components and a homogeneous solid solution precursor alloy. This limits the viable alloy systems that may be used and the range of np-M's that may be formed. Here, we report thermal decomposition of crystalline transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) as a new processing methodology for np-M formation, adding to the spectrum of dealloying protocols. We demonstrate application of this process to the formation of a broader class of np-M including W, Re, Mo, and Ta with feature sizes below 100 nm. The presented facile thermal treatment of TMDs offers a new methodology for the evolution of nanoporosity in a broad range of metals. (C) 2019 Acta Materialia Inc. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

It is characterized by a pyrite-quartz vein type, a medium-high temperature, and the development of visible gold and abundant bismuthides. It is the first reported Au-Bi-associated deposit in this area and remains poorly understood. In this study, the mineral paragenesis has been studied to further understand ore formation, including sulfides (pyrite, chalcopyrite, pyrrhotite, bornite, bismuthinite, tetrahedrite and arsenopyrite), Cu-Bi(Sb) sulfosalts (emplectite, wittichenite, and skinnerite), sulfoselenide (unnamed sulpho-tellurian nevskite), tetradymite group minerals (jose ' ite-A, jose ' ite-B and tetradymite), native bismuth and electrum. The physicochemical conditions of the ore-forming process can be estimated based on the mineral paragenetic sequence. The calculated log alpha H2S and logfO2 of the main mineralization stage are higher than -2.25 and lower than -37.96, respectively. EPMA mapping indicated that ore-forming fluid with low sulfur and oxygen fugacities may have played an important role in provoking the activity of the semimetals such as Bi, Sb, Se and Te. This may have result in the formation of accessory minerals, including native bismuth, skinnerite and an unnamed sulpho-tellurian nevskite via coupled dissolution-reprecipitation (CDR) reactions. Mineralography, EPMA and LA-ICP-MS analysis have revealed a close relationship between Au mineralization and Bi-blebs. It suggests that the "liquid bismuth collector model" contributed to the Au enrichment of the Anfangba deposit. As the coexistence of native bismuth and bismuthinite is commonly seen in different types of hydrothermal gold deposits, the presence of Bi-melts and the influence of the "liquid bismuth collector model" in these gold deposits may have been underestimated.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0169-1368	1872-7360		WOS:000710441100001

The almost exclusive presence of isolated M-N-4 centers as catalytic sites was determined by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The catalysts were electrochemically investigated in a gas diffusion electrode arrangement in bypass mode coupled in-line to a mass spectrometer. This allowed for the nearly simultaneous detection of products and current densities in linear sweep voltammetry experiments, from which potential-dependent specific production rates and faradaic efficiencies could be derived. Postmortem XPS analyses were performed after various stages of operation on the Cu-N-C catalyst, which was the only catalyst to produce hydrocarbons (CH4 and C2H4) in significant amounts. The data provided insights into the potential-induced electronic changes of the Cu-N-C catalyst occurring under operating conditions. Our work further experimentally revealed the high affinity of M-N-C catalysts to convert CO2 to industrially relevant carbonaceous raw materials, while effectively suppressing the competing hydrogen evolution reaction. These results led to a better understanding of the role of the active sites, especially the central metal ion, in M-N-C and could contribute significantly to the improvement of selectivities and activities for the CO2RR in this catalyst class through tailor-made optimization strategies.									19	1	0	0	0	0	20			2155-5435			WOS:000649106200081

Engineering the active sites of electrocatalysts is an important aspect to promote their catalytic performance. In particular, defect engineering provides a feasible and efficient approach to improve the intrinsic activities and increase the number of active sites in electrocatalysts. In this review, recent investigations on defect engineering of a wide range of electrocatalysts such as metal-free carbon materials, transition metal oxides, transition metal dichalcogenides and metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) will be summarized. Different defect creation strategies will be outlined, for example, heteroatom doping and removal, plasma irradiation, hydrogenation, amorphization, phase transition and reduction treatment. In addition, we will overview the commonly used advanced characterization techniques that could confirm the existence and identify the detailed structures, types and concentration of defects in electrocatalysts. The defect characterization tools are beneficial for gaining an in-depth understanding of defects on electrocatalysis and thus could reveal the structure-performance relationship. Finally, the major challenges and future development directions on defect engineering of electrocatalysts will be discussed.									13	0	0	0	1	0	13			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000619559900001	33564804

A gene coding for putative chlorophyll a synthase (chlG) from cyanobacterium Prochlorococcus marinus was amplified by nested polymerase chain reaction and cloned into an inducible-expression plasmid which was subsequently transferred to R. sphaeroides for heterologous expression. Induced expression of chlG in R. sphaeroides led to changes in light absorption spectrum within 400-700nm. The hydrogen production capacity of the mutant strain was evaluated on hydrogen production medium with 15mM malate and 2mM glutamate. Hydrogen yield and productivity were increased by 13.6 and 22.6%, respectively, compared to the wild type strain. The results demonstrated the feasibility of genetic engineering to combine chlorophyll and bacteriochlorophyll biosynthetic pathways which utilize common intermediates. Heterologous expression of key enzymes from biosynthetic pathways of various pigments is proposed here as a general strategy to improve absorption spectra and yield of photosynthesis and hydrogen gas production in bacteria.									2	0	0	0	1	0	2			0233-111X	1521-4028		WOS:000399295900006	27902845

In this work, we examined the use of a concentration/chemical bias as a means of facilitating water-splitting under light illumination without the need for such an externally applied voltage. Such a concentration bias was created by employing a pH differential in the liquid electrolytes within the O-2-generating anode half-cell and the H-2-generating cathode half-cell. A novel, stretchable, highly ion-conductive polyacrylamide CsCl hydrogel was developed to connect the two half-cells. The key feature of the cell was the half-cell electrodes, which comprised thin-film conducting polymer composites that were previously designed to maximize light-driven catalysis at moderate pH. Upon being connected with the hydrogel in the presence of light irradiation (0.25 sun intensity on each electrode), the half-cells spontaneously produced hydrogen and oxygen from water, without the need for an externally applied voltage bias greater than 1.23 V. The cell operated reliably and efficiently for 14 h of continuous testing. These results demonstrate the fundamental feasibility of light-driven water-splitting in a photoelectrochemical concentration cell when employing electrodes that operate efficiently at moderate pH, even with low levels of light illumination. The designed conducting polymer composites proved ideal in that regard.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			2504-477X			WOS:000590991600017

However, the practical utility of these nanocrystals has been hindered by their poor air stability, which induces undesired changes in the optical and electronic properties. An understanding of the degradation of PbSe nanocrystals when they are exposed to air is critical for improving the stability and enhancing their applications. Here, we use in situ transmission electron microscopy (TEM) with an environmental cell connected to air to study PbSe nanocrystal degradation triggered by air exposure. We have also conducted a series of complementary studies, including in situ environmental TEM study of PbSe nanocrystals exposed to pure oxygen and PbSe nanocrystals in H2O using a liquid cell, and ex situ experiments, such as O-2 plasma treatment and thermal heating of PbSe nanocrystals under different air exposure. Our in situ observations reveal that when PbSe nanocrystals are exposed to air (or oxygen) under electron beam irradiation, they experience a series of changes, including shape evolution of individual nanocrystals with the cuboid intermediates, coalescence between nanocrystals, and formation of PbSe thin films through drastic solid-state fusion. Further studies show that the PbSe thin films transform into an amorphous Pb rich phase or eventually pure Pb, which suggest that Se reacts with oxygen and can be evaporated under electron beam illumination. These various in situ and ex situ experimental results indicate that PbSe nanocrystal degradation in air is initiated by the dissociation and removal of ligands from the PbSe nanocrystal surface.									13	0	0	0	1	0	13			0897-4756	1520-5002		WOS:000455558100020		
J	Renger, Gernot								Light induced oxidative water splitting in photosynthesis: Energetics, kinetics and mechanism								JOURNAL OF PHOTOCHEMISTRY AND PHOTOBIOLOGY B-BIOLOGY				104	1-2	SI		35	43		10.1016/j.jphotobiol.2011.01.023				JUL-AUG 2011	2011	The essential steps of photosynthetic water splitting take place in Photosystem II (PS II) and comprise three different reaction sequences: (i) light induced formation of the radical pair P680(+center dot) Q(A)(-center dot) (ii) P680(+center dot) driven oxidative water splitting into O-2 and four protons, and (iii) two step plastoquinone reduction to plastoquinol by Q(A)(-center dot). This mini-review briefly summarizes our state of knowledge on energetics, kinetics and mechanism of oxidative water splitting. Essential features of the two types of reactions involved are described: (a) P680(+center dot) reduction by the redox active tyrosine Y-z, and (b) sequence of oxidation steps induced by Y-z(ox) in the water-oxidizing complex (WOC).The rate of the former reaction is limited by the non-adiabatic electron transfer (NET) step and the multi-phase kinetics shown to originate from a sequence of relaxation processes. In marked contrast, the rate of the stepwise oxidation by Y-z(ox) of the WOC up to the redox level S-3 is not limited by NET but by trigger reactions which probably comprise proton shifts and/or conformational changes. The overall rate of the final reaction sequence leading to formation and release of O-2 is assumed to be limited by the electron transfer step from the S-3 state of WOC to Y-z(ox) due to involvement of an endergonic redox equilibrium. Currently discussed controversial ideas on possible pathways are briefly outlined.Several crucial points of the mechanism of oxidative water splitting, like O-O bond formation, role of local proton shift(s), details of hydrogen bonding, are still not clarified and remain a challenging topic of future research.

The "Oil-Spill Snorkel" consists of a single conductive material (the snorkel) positioned suitably to create an electrochemical connection between the anoxic zone (the contaminated sediment) and the oxic zone (the overlying O-2-containing water). The segment of the electrode buried within the sediment plays a role of anode, accepting electrons deriving from the oxidation of contaminants. Electrons flow through the snorkel up to the part exposed to the aerobic environment (the cathode), where they reduce oxygen to form water. Here we report the results of lab-scale microcosms setup with marine sediments and spiked with crude oil. Microcosms containing one or three graphite snorkels and controls (snorkel-free and autoclaved) were monitored for over 400 days. Collectively, the results of this study confirmed that the snorkels accelerate oxidative reactions taking place within the sediment, as documented by a significant 1.7-fold increase (p = 0.023, two-tailed t-test) in the cumulative oxygen uptake and 1.4-fold increase (p = 0.040) in the cumulative CO2 evolution in the microcosms containing three snorkels compared to snorkel-free controls. Accordingly, the initial rate of total petroleum hydrocarbons (TPH) degradation was also substantially enhanced. Indeed, while after 200 days of incubation a negligible degradation of TPH was noticed in snorkel-free controls, a significant reduction of 12 1% (p = 0.004) and 21 1% (p = 0.001) was observed in microcosms containing one and three snorkels, respectively. Although, the "Oil-Spill Snorkel" potentially represents a groundbreaking alternative to more expensive remediation options, further research efforts are needed to clarify factors and conditions affecting the snorkel-driven biodegradation processes and to identify suitable configurations for field applications.									55	2	0	0	40	0	57			1664-302X			WOS:000360626700001	26388841

Both transient absorption and time-resolved infrared spectroscopy were used to probe the excited state dynamics of this photosensitising unit in a variety of solvents. These studies indicated how environmental factors can influence the photophysics of the BODIPY polymer. A homogeneous photocatalytic hydrogen evolution system has been developed using the BODIPY copolymer and cobaloxime which provides hydrogen evolution rates of 319 mu mol h(-1) g(-1) after 24 h of visible irradiation.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			2296-2646			WOS:000583287900001	33195076

Reliable and sustainable energy conversion devices are highly dependent on engineering of electrocatalysts. State-of-the-art electrocatalysts for these electrochemical conversion systems are usually platinum group metal (PGM)-based nanoparticles with high cost, which has sparked intensive research on atomically dispersed single metal site electrocatalysts for decreasing metal loadings and boosting catalytic efficiencies by taking advantage of their inherent electronic effects, quantum size effects, and metal-support interactions. In this review, we first introduce the concept of atomically dispersed single metal site electrocatalysts, including highlighting their key properties and synthesis strategies, followed by a discussion of the mutual metal-support interactions, and most importantly, how these factors correlate with catalytic properties. Next, the advances in synthetic strategies and characterization techniques for single metal site electrocatalysts are highlighted. Recent advances in single metal site electrocatalysts designs for applications in electrochemical conversion reactions are also presented. Finally, remaining challenges and a forward-looking perspective on this field of research are provided.									41	2	0	0	0	0	42			1369-7021	1873-4103		WOS:000562130000020

The experiments have been carried out in an apparatus with two steps in series: (1) thermal treatment (at 500 degrees C, for the controlled deposition of pyrolytic lignin) and (2) catalytic in-line reforming in a fluidized bed. The reaction conditions have been as follows: oxygen/carbon ratio (O/C), 0, 0.17, 0.34, and 0.67; 700 degrees C; steam/carbon ratio (S/C), 6; space time, 0.3 g(catalyst)h/g(bio-on) (for Ni/La2O3-alpha Al2O3) and 0.1S g(catalyst)h/g(bio-oil) (for Rh/CeO2-ZrO2); time on stream, 4 h. The content and morphology of the coke deposited on the catalysts has been determined by temperature-programmed oxidation (TPO), and the deterioration of the metallic properties of the catalysts by temperature-programmed reduction (TPR) and X-ray diffraction (XRD). The results (bio-oil conversion, product yield and their evolution with time on stream) show that for Rh/CeO2-ZrO2 catalyst the decrease in coke deposition as O/C ratio is increased involves attenuation of catalyst deactivation. Consequently, this catalyst is stable after 24 h operation for high O/C ratios, thus keeping constant the activity for reforming reactions and the WGS reaction, with a high yield of H-2 and low yields of CO, CH4, and hydrocarbons. However, for the Ni/La2O3-alpha Al2O3 catalyst of lower activity than the Rh/CeO2-ZrO2, the decrease in coke content as O/C ratio is increased does not involve a noticeable attenuation in catalyst deactivation, which is due to Ni sintering.									17	0	0	0	0	0	17			0887-0624	1520-5029		WOS:000406356600051

In recent years,researchers have constructed single-atom electrocatalysts with heteroatomic coordination structures by using two or more heteroatoms coordinated to the active center metal atom. It was found that this asym-metric coordination structure effectively modulated the electronic structure of the central metal atom,optimizing the adsorption and desorption energies of the catalytic reaction,and improving the electrocatalytic performance. This paper presents a comprehensive review of the synthesis strategies and characterization techniques of carbon-based single-atom electrocatalysts with heteroatomic coordination structures,and their structure-property correlation for energy electrocatalysis. We give prospects of the future research for this field at the end of the review.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0251-0790			WOS:000819185600001

Recently, a rechargeable aprotic lithium-CO2 (Li-CO2) electrochemical system has been proposed as a new strategy for both energy storage and CO2 capture. However, the study of such a system remains preliminary, and its development still faces huge challenges such as low energy efficiency and electrolyte decomposition caused by a large charge overpotential, which are primarily attributed to the sluggish kinetics of the CO2 activation reaction in Li-CO2 batteries. Therefore, the reasonable design and fabrication of catalysts with excellent catalytic activity and high stability remain a formidable challenge to develop practical Li-CO2 batteries. In this review, based on the introduction of the structure and fundamental electrochemistry of Li-CO2 batteries, we provide an up-to-date and comprehensive review on state-of-the-art design strategies toward highly active catalytic materials and cathode structures for Li-CO2 batteries, inspiring research interests and concerns to this emerging energy storage system and promoting its practical application for future advances in this field.									56	5	0	0	2	0	57			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000490235800003

The current efficiency is maintained at 100% for more than 6 times longer period compared to the conventional plating method using a one-compartment cell. The present iridium plating is also superior in crack formation. The addition of glycerol is effective in reducing the crack formation not only in freshly prepared plating baths but also in plating baths used for long periods. (C) 2010 The Electrochemical Society.

J	Chaplin, Brian P.; Hubler, David K.; Farrell, James								Understanding anodic wear at boron doped diamond film electrodes								ELECTROCHIMICA ACTA				89				122	131		10.1016/j.electacta.2012.10.166				FEB 1 2013	2013	This research investigated the mechanisms associated with anodic wear of boron-doped diamond (BDD) film electrodes. Cyclic voltammetry (CV), x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) were used to measure changes in electrode response and surface chemistry as a function of the charge passed and applied current density. Density functional theory (DFT) modeling was used to evaluate possible reaction mechanisms. The initial hydrogen-terminated surface was electrochemically oxidized at lower potentials than water oxidation (<= 1.83 V/SHE), and was not catalyzed by the hydrogen-terminated surface. In the region where water oxidation produces hydroxyl radicals (OH center dot), the hydrogen-terminated surface may also be oxidized by chemical reaction with OH center dot. Oxygen atoms became incorporated into the surface via reaction of carbon atoms with OH center dot, forming both C=O and C-OH functional groups, that were also detected by XPS measurements. Experimental and DFT modeling results indicate that the oxygenated diamond surface lowers the potential for activationless water oxidation from 2.74 V/SHE for the hydrogen terminated surface to 2.29 V/SHE for the oxygenated surface. Electrode wear was accelerated at high current densities (i.e., 500 mA cm(-2)), where SEM results indicated oxidation of the BDD film resulted in significant surface roughening. These results are supported by EIS measurements that document an increase in the double-layer capacitance as a function of the charge passed. DFT simulations provide a possible mechanism that explains the observed diamond oxidation. DFT simulation results indicate that BDD edge sites (=CH2) can be converted to COOH functional groups, which are further oxidized via reactions with OH center dot to form H2CO3(aq.) with an activation energy of 58.9 kJ mol(-1).

Controlled incorporation of oxygen into the first two layers of the silicon surface is achieved via sequential water (H2O) exposures and stepwise annealing in ultrahigh vacuum. Transmission infrared spectroscopy is used to monitor the transition from vibrational modes characteristic of isolated Si-O structures, so-called silicon epoxides, to extended modes with the character of transverse optical and longitudinal optical phonons in an extended SiO2 film. Quantum chemical calculations on two-dimer silicon clusters identify these modes as arising predominantly from coupling between species on adjacent dimer units, consistent with the thermodynamic driving force for local oxygen agglomeration. The vibrational signature of this surface is proposed to offer a link between well-characterized local surface Si-O structures and the extended SiOx film that exists between Si(100) and SiO2 after thermal oxidation of silicon.

The microstructure and electrochemical properties of the electrodes were investigated within the sintering temperature range of 1,000-1,100 degrees C. An obvious effect of sintering temperature on the microstructure and electrochemical properties was detected. The variation of the electrochemical properties with sintering temperature was explained in relation to the microstructural evolution of the porous electrodes. It was detected that the electrode processes greatly depended on the microstructure of the electrodes. The polarization of surface oxygen exchange process was found to be the major contribution to the total electrode polarization. The electrode sintered at 1,050 degrees C showed the optimum electrocatalytic activity among the investigated electrodes. At 800 degrees C, the electrode exhibited a polarization resistance of 0.42 Omega cm(2), an overpotential of 48 mV at a current density of 200 mA cm(-2) and an exchange current density of 121 mA cm(-2).									20	0	0	0	0	0	20			0947-7047			WOS:000300677300011

Efficient energy conversion from methanol requires an active and durable catalyst to drive the anodic methanol oxidation reaction (MOR) in direct methanol fuel cells. As an alternative to high cost noble metals, cobalt-based electrocatalysts are considered potential replacements that meet the high activity and long-term stability for MOR. Herein, we report the preparation of hierarchical Co9S8 nanowires trapped in Ndoped carbon nanotubes (N,S-Co@CNT) derived from melamine showing high activity for MOR in alkaline medium. In order to identify the main active sites, we synthesized cobalt particles embedded in carbon structures in absence of a sulphur source (Co@CNT) and evaluated its performance for MOR. The material characterization shows that adding sulphur during pyrolysis enhances the surface area, pore size and lattice defect. In addition, the morphology changes from hemi-spherical particles to nanowires, that significantly improves the electrochemical properties. The current density of N,S-Co@CNT is exceptionally higher (5.5 times) and the onset potential of MOR is shifted to lower potential when compared to Co@CNT. The enhanced activity, durability and stability of N,S -Co@CNT is ascribed to the unique hierarchical structure and surface properties. (c) 2021 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC.

The Mn K-edge energy for the Ca-depleted S1-state was lower by 1.5 eV than that for the normal S1-state. The K-edge energy upshifted by 1 eV after one flash, indicative of an oxidation of Mn. After two flashes, the K-edge was elevated as well by 0.4 eV, and then reached a steady-state high level after continuous illumination where the K-edge energy was higher by 0.9 eV than that after one flash. The results indicate that the Mn-cluster and/or its direct ligand could be oxidized up to two electrons but further events are blocked.									16	0	0	0	9	0	16			0014-5793			WOS:A1993LW02300007	8396538

The optical analysis showed a redshift displacement in the case of C3N4/LaMnO3 and C3N4/LaCoO3 composites due to perovskite particles act as electron traps. By photoluminescence, we elucidate that LaFeO3 generates intermediate states inside the structure of C3N4 indicating an intimate intermixing, which is also corroborated by electrochemical characterizations. The activity of the composites towards the hydrogen evolution reaction was tested under simulated solar irradiation without sacrificial agent neither noble metals. Incorporation of 2% of perovskite over C3N4 showed the best efficiencies. C3N4/2%LaFeO3 SG and C3N4/2%LaFeO3 SS showed the highest activities (140 mu mol h(-1) g(-1) and 40 mu mol h(-1) g(-1) respectively). These results are attributed to the better coupling between C3N4 and LaFeO3 and the formation of a type II heterostructure. Meanwhile, the activity of C3N4/LaMnO3 and C3N4/LaCoO3 composites exhibited lower performance compared with composites prepared with LaFeO3 particles, related to the creation of a type I heterostructure where the flow of charges is not efficient, limiting the photocatalytic performance.									8	1	0	0	1	0	9			1369-8001	1873-4081		WOS:000483376900029

Unencysted metacercariae of Tylodelphys sp. inhabit the cranial cavity of the fish Galaxias maculatus; however, to date they have not been documented to alter their host behavior. The goal of this study was to evaluate the potential effects of Tylodelphys sp. inhabiting the cranial cavity of Galaxias maculatus on host physiology and swimming behavior as well as its reaction to a simulated predation attempt. Blind experiments in the lab were carried out on 56 fish that were filmed individually. The Fulton condition factor (K) was used as an approximation of nutritional status and a respirometry chamber was used to evaluate oxygen consumption rates of fish. Of the 56 fish, 21 were parasitized by Tylodelphys sp. (mean intensity = 30, range from 1 to 101). Parasitized and non-parasitized fish were similar in condition factor and oxygen consumption rates. Furthermore, the oxygen consumption rate of G. maculatus was not correlated with the abundance of Tylodelphys sp. However, parasitized fish more frequently swam close to the water surface, whereas non-parasitized fish more frequently swam at intermediate depths. When faced with a simulated predator attack, unparasitized fish showed more frequent fleeing behavior as well as a more intense post-fleeing activity. Collectively, these results suggest that Tylodelphys sp. inhabiting the cranial cavity of fish may alter their behavior predisposing them to predation by birds.									1	0	0	0	1	0	1			2167-8359			WOS:000631247300004	33828918

(1990) Biochim. Biophys. Acta 1017, 63-69; Messinger, J., Schroder, W. P., and Renger, G. (1993) Biochemistry 32, 7658-7668], but the difference between the activation energies of the Slow S-2 and S-3 decays is significantly larger in S. elongatus than in spinach. These results are discussed in terms of differences between cyanobacteria and higher plants on the acceptor side of PSII and a shift of the redox potential of the couple Y-D/Y-D(ox). The obtained data are also suitable to address questions about effects of the redox state of Y-D on the miss probability and the possibility of an S state dependent miss parameter.									50	0	0	0	39	0	50			0006-2960			WOS:000184499000002	12885225

As a consequence, introducing N functionalities in organic molecules is attracting strong continuous interest. The past decade has witnessed the emergence of very efficient and selective catalytic systems achieving this goal thanks to engineered hemoproteins. In this review, we examine how these enzymes have been engineered focusing rather on the rationale behind it than the meth-odology employed. These studies are put in perspective with respect to in vitro and in vivo nitrene transfer processes performed by cytochromes P450. An emphasis is put on mechanistic aspects which are confronted to current molecular knowledge of these reactions.

Cu2O is a potential candidate because it is non-toxic, inexpensive, an abundant compound in the Earth's crust, and has good optical properties, such as a high absorption coefficient. In this work, Cu2O was obtained simply by reducing Benedict's solution with glucose in an alkaline medium (pH 10.2 +/- 0.2) at 65 degrees C. The samples were synthesized by varying glucose content from 1 g to 7 g. The results showed a phase proportion variation between 95.56% and 99.50% of the Cu2O phase. It was found that the changes in crystallite size, microstrains, particle size, and morphology are due to reaction times, which were influenced by the use of different glucose amounts. The use of a higher glucose amount in the synthesis favors a faster reaction, forming smaller crystallites with more microstrains. Lower glucose amount leads to a slower reaction giving the crystallites more time to grow, which relaxes the microstrains. When increasing glucose content, the obtained morphologies changed from cubes, irregular cubes, prismatic spheres, cauliflower-like, to spherical shapes. The XPS spectra confirmed only the presence of chemical species such as Cu(I) and Cu(II), and chemical defects, such as oxygen vacancies (Vo), were detected in the samples. All samples presented a broad absorption range from 200 nm to 570 nm indistinctly of the morphology. The band gap showed an insignificant change from 2.04 eV to 2.09 eV when glucose was increased from 1 g to 7 g. The in-situ phase transformation study was analyzed from 25 degrees C to 700 degrees C. The results indicated a phase transition from Cu2O to Cu and CuO when the temperature was above 280 degrees C.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1687-4110	1687-4129		WOS:000858644900002

The main goal of the regulation is to keep the basic photosynthetic reactions, i.e. capturing light energy, conversion into chemical energy and production of carbohydrates, in balance. The rationale behind the evolution of strong regulation mechanisms is to keep photosynthesis functional under all conditions encountered by sessile plants during their lifetimes. The regulatory mechanisms may, however, also impair photosynthetic efficiency by overriding the photosynthetic reactions in controlled environments like crop fields or bioreactors, where light energy could be used for production of sugars instead of dissipation as heat and down-regulation of carbon fixation. The plant chloroplast has a high number of regulatory proteins called thioredoxins (TRX), which control the function of chloroplasts from biogenesis and assembly of chloroplast machinery to light and carbon fixation reactions as well as photoprotective mechanisms. Here, we review the current knowledge of regulation of photosynthesis by chloroplast TRXs and assess the prospect of improving plant photosynthetic efficiency by modification of chloroplast thioredoxin systems.									51	2	0	0	42	0	52			0264-6021	1470-8728		WOS:000465201600009	30988137

As an alternative to noble metals, Ni-based alloys have shown excellent performance and good stability toward the MOR. Herein, we present a series of Ni3-xCoxSn2 colloidal nanoparticles (NPs) with composition tuned over the entire Ni/Co range (0 x 3). We demonstrate electrodes based on these ternary NPs to provide improved catalytic performance toward the MOR in an alkaline medium when compared with binary Ni3Sn2 NPs. A preliminary composition optimization resulted in Ni2.5Co0.5Sn2 NP-based electrodes exhibiting extraordinary mass current densities, up to 1050 mA mg(-1), at 0.6 V vs. Hg/HgO in 1.0 M KOH containing 1.0 M methanol. This current density was about two-fold higher than that of Ni3Sn2 electrodes (563 mA mg(-1)). The excellent performance obtained with the substitution of small amounts of Ni by Co was concomitant with an increase of the surface coverage of active species and an enhancement of the diffusivity of the reaction limiting species. Additionally, saturation of the catalytic activity at higher methanol concentrations was measured for Ni3-xCoxSn2 NP-based electrodes containing a small amount of Co when compared with binary Ni3Sn2 NPs. While the electrode stability was improved with respect to elemental Ni NP-based electrodes, the introduction of small amounts of Co slightly decreased the cycling performance. Additionally, Sn, a key element to improve stability with respect to elemental Ni NPs, was observed to slowly dissolve in the presence of KOH. Density functional theory calculations on metal alloy surfaces showed the incorporation of Co within the Ni3Sn2 structure to provide more effective sites for CO and CH3OH adsorption. However, the relatively lower stability could not be related to CO or CH3OH poisoning.									51	1	0	0	1	0	51			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000451738200056

Despite substantial removal of oxide ions, all the reduced monoliths retain the macropore properties of the precursor, i.e., uniform pore size distribution and pore volume. Furthermore, compared to commercial porous Ebonex (shaped conductive TinO2n-1), the bulk densities (1.8 g cm(-3)) are half, and the porosities (60%) are about 3 times higher. The obtained TinO2n-1 (n = 2, 3, 4, 6) macroporous monoliths could find applications as electrodes for many electrochemical reactions.									98	12	0	0	11	0	103			0002-7863			WOS:000305863900035	22686579	
J	He, Yan; Tang, Meiling; Fan, Lin; Sun, Jingting; Gao, Xingjun								Investigation of the atomistic behavior in nanofinishing single-crystal aluminium nitride with hydroxyl radical center dot OH environment								COMPUTATIONAL MATERIALS SCIENCE				214						111770	10.1016/j.commatsci.2022.111770				NOV 2022	2022	The effect of depth of pressing and sliding velocity on chemical reaction, wear and atom removal mechanisms was investigated in nanofinishing single-crystal aluminum nitride with hydroxyl radical center dot OH environment. The simulation results show that aluminum nitride can be oxidized by hydroxyl radical center dot OH from the perspective of free energy change. Only chemical action, the decomposed atoms in the solution form bonds with the Al atoms on the aluminum nitride surface, and the bonds are expressed in the form of O-[A](n), H-[Al](n) and OH-[Al](n). However, no Al atoms were discovered to break away from the substrate. The potential energy of substrate and the number of Al-O bonds are positively correlated with the depth of pressing and sliding velocity, and the degree of chemical reaction can be promoted by strong mechanical behavior. The tangential force relies on interfacial Al-C and Al-O-C bonds, the more interfacial bonds between substrate and abrasive, the more severe wear of the substrate surface. The sliding of diamond abrasive leads to the amorphous evolution of the crystal structure, and the separation of atoms from the initial position produces defects, which destroys the stable covalent bond structure of aluminum nitride. As a result, the total number of dangling bonds (i.e. unsaturated bond) of surface layer atoms increases, and the greater the depth of pressing and velocity, the more obvious this phenomenon will be, and the more atoms will be removed. In this study, atomic removal behavior of aluminum nitride was systematically analyzed at atomic scale, which will provide theoretical guidance for ultra-precision and low-damage processing of aluminum nitride.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0927-0256	1879-0801		WOS:000855271200005

The first part of the paper focuses on the discussion of the opportunities and challenges of this method for the characterization of the solid-liquid interface in water splitting. The second part of the paper focuses on recent results and future perspectives. We present stable and robust operando ATR-FTIR measurements using low temperature processing of hematite and a set-up where the functional thin film is integrated on the ATR crystal. We find increased absorbance as a function of applied potential at wavenumber values of 1000 cm(-1)-900 cm(-1) and relate this to changes in the surface species during water oxidation. We argue that this approach has the potential to be developed to a routine method for the characterization of interfaces in water splitting. Such ATR-FTIR data is of crucial importance for the validation of models in microkinetic modeling. We show some recent results of microkinetic modeling of the hematite-electrolyte interface and explain how a combination of operando ATR-FTIR measurements and microkinetic modeling enables the identification of the reaction mechanism in water splitting. We discuss how this combined approach will enable designing of tailored catalysts and accelerating their development in the future.									4	1	0	0	1	0	5			0022-3727	1361-6463		WOS:000609435900001

Here, a few layered black phosphorus/MoS2 (BP-MoS2) nanohybrid was successfully prepared and verified it for photocatalytic hydrogen evolution using CdS nanorods as light absorbers. The resulting nanohybrids manifest remarkable catalytic performance with high amount of H-2 production (CdS/BP-MoS2: 183.24 mmol h(-1) g(-1)) and outstanding catalytic stability. The observed amount of H-2 is much higher than that of various CdS/BP and CdS/MoS2 based nanohybrids reported earlier. We expect that the demonstrated new heterostructured design strategy may bring novel insights to develop low-price noble metal free photocatalysts for hydrogen evolution.									111	4	0	0	7	0	112			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000449444000051

It is difficult to describe this transition process simply because there are no recognized intermediary organisms between the two bacterial groups. Gloeobacter violaceus PCC 7421 might be a model organism that is suitable for analysis because it still possesses primordial characteristics such as the absence of thylakoid membranes. Whole genome analysis and biochemical and biophysical surveys of G. violaceus have favored the hypothesis that it is an intermediary organism. On the other hand, species differentiation is an evolutionary process that could be driven by changes in a small number of genes, and this process might give fair information more in details by monitoring of those genes. Comparative studies of genes, including those in Acaryochloris marina MBIC 11017, have provided information relevant to species differentiation; in particular, the acquisition of a new pigment, chlorophyll d, and changes in amino acid sequences have been informative. Here, based on experimental evidence from these two species, we discuss some of the evolutionary pathways for the appearance and differentiation of cyanobacteria.									29	0	0	0	28	0	30			0166-8595	1573-5079		WOS:000257956400005	18568415

Photocatalytic water splitting utilizing particulate semiconductors offers great potential for the production of renewable hydrogen, while this cross-road among biology, chemistry, and physics features a topic with fascinating interdisciplinary challenges. Progress in photocatalytic water splitting has been achieved in recent years, ranging from fundamental scientific research to pioneering scalable practical applications. In this review, we focus mainly on the recent advancements in terms of the development of new light-absorption materials, insights and strategies for photogenerated charge separation, and studies towards surface catalytic reactions and mechanisms. In particular, we emphasize several efficient charge separation strategies such as surface-phase junction, spatial charge separation between facets, and polarity-induced charge separation, and also discuss their unique properties including ferroelectric and photo-Dember effects on spatial charge separation. By integrating time- and space-resolved characterization techniques, critical issues in photocatalytic water splitting including photoinduced charge generation, separation and transfer, and catalytic reactions are analyzed and reviewed. In addition, photocatalysts with state-of-art efficiencies in the laboratory stage and pioneering scalable solar water splitting systems for hydrogen production using particulate photocatalysts are presented. Finally, some perspectives and outlooks on the future development of photocatalytic water splitting using particulate photocatalysts are proposed.									17	1	0	0	0	0	18			0306-0012	1460-4744		WOS:000780469100001	35403632

The Au-20Sn solder, which is one of the hot topics of the current research in the field of electronic packaging, is widely used in flip-chip, light-emitting diode and hermetic package fields because of its good creep resistance, corrosion resistance and flux-free soldering. Recent research about the microstructure, wettability, interfacial intermetallic compounds, and mechanical properties of Au-20Sn solder were reviewed. This paper focuses on the interfacial reaction of Au-20Sn with different substrates and the mechanical properties of Au-20Sn solder joints.

Herein, PdNi-S/C nanowires with inductive sulfite has been successfully crafted through hydrothermal synthesis and applied as a superior hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) catalyst. Based on the autocatalytic mechanism, PdNi alloy nanoparticles were synthesized by controlling reduction kinetics with the presence of formic acid. Meanwhile, the sulfite is selected as an effective inductive agent to form PdNi-S/C nanowires with amorphous interfaces. The morphology, composition, and electronic structure of the synthesized PdNi-S/C were studied in detail. The PdNi-S/C manifests excellent HER performance in alkaline solution with an overpotentials of 67 mV at current density of 10 mA cm(-2), a Tafel slope of 69.4 mV dec(-1), and significantly long-term durability. The improvement of HER performance of the PdNi-S/C is attributed to the one-dimensional nanowire structure, abundant sulfur vacancies and defects, and the synergistic effect between PdNi-S nanowires with the graphite carbon. Furthermore, this present work offers a novel method for structure adjustment of materials to effectively control their property and catalytic performance.									15	2	0	0	1	0	15			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000508464500028	31851479

The active sites can be coordinatively unsaturated metal ions, substituents at the organic linkers or guest species located inside the pores. The defects on the structure also create these open sites. The present review summarizes the current state of the art in the use of MOFs as solid catalysts according to the type of site, making special emphasis on the more recent strategies to increase the population of these active sites and tuning their activity, either by adapting the synthesis conditions or by post-synthetic modification. This review highlights those reports illustrating the synergy derived from the presence of more than one of these types of sites, leading to activation of a substrate by more than one site or to the simultaneous activation of different substrates by complementary sites. This synergy is frequently the main reason for the higher catalytic activity of MOFs compared to homogeneous catalysts or other alternative solid materials. Besides dark reactions, this review also summarizes the use of MOFs as photocatalysts emphasizing the uniqueness of these materials regarding adaptation of the linkers as light absorbers and metal exchange at the nodes to enhance photoinduced electron transfer, in comparison with conventional inorganic photocatalysts. This versatility and flexibility that is offered by MOFs to optimize their visible light photocatalytic activity explains the current interest in exploiting these materials for novel photocatalytic reactions, including hydrogen evolution and photocatalytic CO2 reduction.									792	36	2	0	82	1	808			0306-0012	1460-4744		WOS:000449968700012	30003212

To overcome the drawback of MoO2 electronic conductivity, a novel hierarchical carbon coated molybdenum dioxide (MoO2@C) nanotube built from ultra-thin nanosheets was utilized as a nanostructured support. Pt NPs were uniformly deposited onto the MoO2@C support and a hierarchical Pt-based anode catalyst was successfully synthesized. Benefitting from several favourable features, including high exposed surface area, short diffusion distance, fast charge transfer and homogeneous Pt NPs dispersion, the Pt/MoO2@C catalyst exhibited an improved activity along with enhanced stability for methanol electrooxidation when compared with that of the Pt/C catalyst. This novel hierarchical structure is helpful for the further applications in hydrogen evolution reaction, supercapacitors and batteries.									34	0	0	0	0	0	34			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000395309800034

The investigation included aqueous chemical and isotopic composition, chemistry of mineral phases, geochemical modelling, and tritium and radiocarbon groundwater dating. Chemical diversity in the groundwater system is created by the mixing of modern fresh water and older sulphate water with higher dissolved solids. The system is treated as a system of flows of two end-member water types. Geochemical modelling is used for: (1) explaining the origin of the chemistry of both water components, (2) quantifying the groundwater mixing, (3) correcting the radiocarbon age of the groundwater for the effects of chemical water-rock interactions, and (4) calculating reaction rates. Study of stable (C, S, O, H) and unstable (H-3, C-14) isotopes allowed the inverse mass balance geochemical models to be verified and specified, and the groundwater to be dated.The chemistry of the modern, tritium-bearing, fresh water is a result of dissolution of limestones, dolomites and gypsum. The mean tritium-age of this water, based on the lumped-parameter approach, varies between 10 and 200 years. The sulphate mineral water owes its chemistry to the process of dedolomitization driven by gypsum dissolution. Its radiocarbon age is about 5.9 ka BP, i.e., during the Mid-Holocene Climatic Optimum. Rates of chemical reactions responsible for the formation of sulphate type water are estimated to be: dissolution of gypsum (2.85 mu mol/L/year) and dolomite (0.21 mu mol/L/year), calcite precipitation (0.20 mu mol/L/year), organic matter decomposition (0.08 mu mol/L/year).									3	0	0	0	1	0	3			0001-5709	2300-1887		WOS:000271026200005

Photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting (WS) is seen as a leading strategy for producing an extremely promising renewable store of energy - hydrogen (H-2). However, PEC-WS is a complex process involving several sequential physicochemical reaction steps including light absorption, separation of photoexcited charges, and surface redox reactions. At present, FeO-based semiconductors represent a unique class of materials known to exhibit very high performance in all these processes. This review summarizes and critically discusses the major components of PEC-WS systems incorporating FeO-based light-harvesting systems, and outlines the progress that has been made, particularly over the last decade. Emphasis is placed on materials used as photoanodes (including hematite and nonhematite iron oxides, spinel iron ferrites, and pseudobrookite iron titanates) as well as materials used as cocatalysts and passivation layers - notably iron hydroxyoxides and their composites. We discuss strategies for overcoming the main limitations of the aforementioned materials via nanostructuring, elemental doping, surface decoration, and the formation of advanced hybrid nanoarchitectures. Finally, we use this knowledge to present a critical overview of the field and the future prospects of Fe-O semiconductors in PEC-WS applications.									33	0	0	0	5	0	33			0079-6425	1873-2208		WOS:000518872700003

We find that a helium detonation cannot easily descend into the core unless it commences (artificially) well above the hottest layer calculated for the helium shell in current presupernova models. Compressional waves induced by the sliding helium detonation, however, robustly generate hot spots which trigger a detonation in the core. Our simulations show that this is true even for non-axisymmetric initial conditions. If the helium is ignited at multiple points, then the internal waves can pass through one another or be reflected, but this added complexity does not defeat the generation of the hot spot. The ignition of very low-mass helium shells depends on whether a thermonuclear runaway can simultaneously commence in a sufficiently large region.									62	1	0	0	0	0	62			0004-637X	1538-4357		WOS:000323888900046

Due to the significantly reduced grain boundaries, ZnO nanorods facilitate a fast electron transfer through their smooth tunnels and are well suited as a photocatalyst. However, the photocatalytic hydrogen evolution performance of pristine ZnO nanorods is still low due to the high recombination rate of photogenerated electron-hole pairs and the less light absorption. Here, a novel structure about black ZnO nanorods (NRs)/TiO2-X mesoporous spheres (MSs) heterojunction has been prepared and the photocatalytic hydrogen evolution performance has been explored. The photocatalytic activity test results showed that ZnO NRs/TiO2-X MSs exhibited higher catalytic activity than ZnO NRs for hydrogen production. Compared to the pure ZnO NRs photoanode, the photocurrent of ZnO NRs/TiO2-X MSs heterojunction photoanode could reach 0.41 mA/cm(2) in view of the expanding spectral response region and effective inhibition of e(-)/h(+) recombination at the same condition. Using a relatively integrated experimental investigation and mechanism analysis, we scrutinized that after being treated with NaBH4, TiO2 MSs introduce oxygen vacancies expanding the photocatalytic activity of pure TiO2, and improving conductivity and charge transport capabilities through coating on ZnO NRs. More importantly, the results provide a promising approach in the NRs/MSs composite structure serving as photoanodes for photocatalytic hydrogen production.									7	0	0	0	0	0	7				2079-4991		WOS:000594513500001	33105770

Early researchers employed fluorometry primarily for two tasks: to elucidate the role in photosynthesis, if any, of other plant pigments, such as Chl b, Chl c, carotenoids and phycobilins; and to use it as a convenient inverse measure of photosynthetic activity. In pursuing the latter task, it became apparent that Chl a fluorescence emission is influenced (i) by redox active Chl a molecules in the reaction center of photosystem (PS) 11 (photochemical quenching); (ii) by an electrochemical imbalance across the thylakoid membrane (high energy quenching); and (iii) by the size of the peripheral antennae of weakly fluorescent PSI and strongly fluorescent PSII in response to changes in the ambient light (state transitions).In this perspective we trace the historical evolution of our awareness of these concepts, particularly of the so-called 'State Transitions'. 2011 Elsevier B.V.

All films prepared by chemical solution deposition exhibited smooth and crack-free surfaces, which were observed using an atomic force microscope. After 10(4) field cycling, a maximum remanent polarization of 10.5 mu C/cm(2) was achieved in HfO2 films with 4.8 mol. % Ca content. Meanwhile, the breakdown of the film occurred after 7 x 10(6) electric cycles. A phase transition from the monoclinic phase to cubic/orthorhombic phases was observed with increasing Ca concentration. We suggest the change in oxygen vacancy concentration as the origin of phase evolution, which was confirmed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analysis. These results open a new pathway for realizing ferroelectricity in HfO2-based films. Published under license by AIP Publishing.									22	0	0	0	0	0	22			0021-8979	1089-7550		WOS:000503996400016

In this study, we use a multi-scale modeling approach to interrogate the implications of three metabolic scenarios of potential clinical relevance: the Warburg effect, the reverse Warburg effect and glutamine addiction. At the intracellular level, we construct a network of central metabolism and perform flux balance analysis (FBA) to estimate metabolic fluxes; at the cellular level, we exploit this metabolic network to calculate parameters for a coarse-grained description of cellular growth kinetics; and at the multicellular level, we incorporate these kinetic schemes into the cellular automata of an agent-based model (ABM), iDynoMiCS. This ABM evaluates the reaction-diffusion of the metabolites, cellular division and motion over a simulation domain. Our multi-scale simulations suggest that the Warburg effect provides a growth advantage to the tumor cells under resource limitation. However, we identify a non-monotonic dependence of growth rate on the strength of glycolytic pathway. On the other hand, the reverse Warburg scenario provides an initial growth advantage in tumors that originate deeper in the tissue. The metabolic profile of stromal cells considered in this scenario allows more oxygen to reach the tumor cells in the deeper tissue and thus promotes tumor growth at earlier stages. Lastly, we suggest that glutamine addiction does not confer a selective advantage to tumor growth with glutamine acting as a carbon source in the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, any advantage of glutamine uptake must come through other pathways not included in our model (e.g., as a nitrogen donor). Our analysis illustrates the importance of accounting explicitly for spatial and temporal evolution of tumor microenvironment in the interpretation of metabolic scenarios and hence provides a basis for further studies, including evaluation of specific therapeutic strategies that target metabolism.									21	0	0	0	15	0	21				1553-7358		WOS:000454835100016	30532226

The surface hole trap is a critical factor that limits the photocatalytic activity of pristine La2Ti2O7. Deposition of cobalt phosphate (Co-Pi) and platinum (Pt) nanoparticles on La2Ti2O7 cannot remove the surface traps although they are essential for enabling the oxygen and hydrogen evolution reactions. It is interesting that doping bismuth (Bi) into La2Ti2O7 nanosheets has eliminated the surface traps due to surface enrichment of Bi. The Co-Pi/Bi-La2Ti2O7/Pt nanosheets exhibit increasing photocatalytic activity toward overall water splitting with increasing the Bi-dopant level up to 5 at.%. Further increasing the Bi-dopant level leads to the formation of localized states above the valence band, leading to the lifetime reduction of photogenerated charge-carriers, and jeopardizing the photocatalytic activity. This work proposes an effective strategy to address the surface trapping and surface catalysis issues in the nanostructured metal oxide photocatalysts.									7	0	0	0	0	0	7			1998-0124	1998-0000		WOS:000656780500001		
J	Yu, Chunlin; Zhang, Xingwang								Synthesis of a Cu2O/Carbon Film/NiCoB-Graphene Oxide Heterostructure as Photocathode for Photoelectrochemical Water Splitting								CHEMELECTROCHEM				6	7			2004	2012		10.1002/celc.201801701				APR 1 2019	2019	Photoelectrochemical cells (PECs) for water splitting offer a promising way to convert solar energy into chemical energy. The electron transfer rate and surface-catalyzed ability toward the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) play key roles in the efficiency of PEC water splitting. In this work, a photocathode based on a Cu2O/Carbon film/NiCoB-graphene oxide (Cu2O/C/NiCoB-GO) heterostructure is fabricated. The thickness-controllable carbon film served as the electron transport and protective layer with favorable optical properties. The NiCoB-GO amorphous catalyst displays efficient performance towards HER in neutral condition. The optimized photocathode shows a PEC-HER performance with a photocurrent density of -2.9 mA/cm(2) at 0 V vs. RHE, and it also presents better stability than bare Cu2O. This work provides a novel heterostructure photocathode for promoting solar-driven PEC water splitting efficiently.									10	0	0	0	0	0	10			2196-0216			WOS:000466798700008

Chemical reactions in liquid steel in the deoxidation process were analyzed and the predominance diagram of inclusion was obtained by thermodynamic calculation. The results indicate the order of deoxidant addition had a great influence on the morphology of inclusions. When Ti was added prior to Al, many Al-Ti composite inclusions containing Fe phase with concentration gradient ("hollow") formed in the liquid steel. The radial length of inclusions increases, and inclusions are more likely to be partial. So this deoxidation method is not conducive to refining and dispersing inclusions. When Al was added prior to Ti, alumina is formed in the steel, which will not be reduced by dissolved titanium, so the inclusion does not contain iron phase inside. The inclusions are mainly Al-Ti-O (-N) inclusions. The size and quantity of inclusions are less than Ti was added prior to Al.The formation and evolution mechanism of inclusions under different Al-Ti deoxidation order and the formation mechanism of Al-Ti composite inclusions with "hollow structure" with concentration gradient was explored and analyzed based on the results of FactSage calculation, chemical reaction analysis, and experimental detection. The effect of the addition order of deoxidizer on the size, number and distribution of inclusions was discussed. It is found that under the deoxygenation mode of adding titanium first and then aluminum, titanium oxides will react with aluminum metal, titanium oxides will gradually change into "hollow" alumina shell, while dissolved aluminum, titanium and oxygen oxidation reaction, forming a concentration gradient of Al_2O_3-TiOx complex inclusions, and finally titanium oxide completely converted into alumina shell and disappear. With the filling of iron liquid, an aluminum titanium inclusion containing iron phase is formed.			通过扫描电镜-能谱仪检测和分析了不同铝钛脱氧顺序下钢中夹杂物的形貌、成分、尺寸、数量和分布等参数,通过热力学计算分析了脱氧过程中钢液中的化学反应和夹杂物优势区图。结果表明,脱氧剂添加顺序对夹杂物形貌影响很大,先加钛后加铝的脱氧方式下,钢液中形成了较多含有铁相("空心")的具有浓度梯度的铝钛复合夹杂物。夹杂物径向长度增加,夹杂物也更容易偏聚。所以先加钛后加铝不利于夹杂物尺寸细小化,不利于夹杂物弥散分布。先加铝后加钛的脱氧方式下,钢中形成氧化铝夹杂,不会被溶解的钛还原,因此夹杂物内部不含有铁相。夹杂物主要为Al-Ti-O(-N)类夹杂。夹杂物尺寸和数量小于先加钛后加铝钢中的夹杂物。通过FactSage计算结果、化学反应分析和试验检测结果,探究了不同铝钛脱氧顺序下夹杂物形成和演变机理,分析了具有浓度梯度的"空心结构"的铝钛复合夹杂物形成机理,讨论了脱氧剂添加顺序对夹杂物尺寸、数量和分布等特征的影响规律。发现先加钛后加铝的脱氧方式下,钛氧化物会与金属铝反应,钛氧化物逐渐转变为"空心"氧化铝壳,同时溶解的铝、钛和氧发生氧化反应,形成了具有浓度梯度的Al_2O_3-TiOx复合夹杂物,最终钛氧化物完全转变为氧化铝壳而消失。随着铁液的填充,形成了含有铁相的铝钛夹杂物。						1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0449-749X			CSCD:7101317

ACS CATALYSIS				10	1			253	264		10.1021/acscatal.9b01925				JAN 3 2020	2020	We use density functional theory calculations to study a group of 213 materials known as MXenes toward the electrochemical nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR) to ammonia. So far, all computational studies have only considered the NRR chemistry on unfunctionalized (bare) MXenes. In this study, we investigate a total of 65 bare and functionalized MXenes. We establish free energy diagrams for the NRR on the basal planes of 55 different M2XTx MXenes (M = Ti, V, Zr, Nb, Mo, Ta, W; X = C, N) to span a large variety of possible chemistries. Energy trends with respect to the metal as well as nonmetal constituent of the MXenes are established for both bare and functionalized MXenes. We determine the limiting potentials and find that either the formation of NH3 from *NH2 or the formation of *N2H is the potential limiting reaction step for bare and functionalized MXenes, respectively. We find several Mo-, W-, and V-based MXenes (Mo2C, Mo2N, W2N, W2NH2, and V2N) to have suitable theoretical overpotentials for the NRR. Importantly, calculated Pourbaix stability diagrams combined with selectivity analysis, however, reveal that all bare MXenes are not stable under relevant NRR operating conditions. The only functionalized MXene with the three minimum required properties (i) having a low theoretical overpotential, (ii) being stable under NRR conditions, and (iii) having selectivity toward NRR rather than the parasitic HER is W2CH2, which is a H-terminated MXene. Finally, on the basis of our findings, we explore other routes for improving the NRR chemistry by studying 10 additional MXenes with the chemical formula M3X2Tx and MXenes with other functional groups (T-x = S, F, Cl). This opens up a larger variety and tunability of MXenes to be considered for the NRR.									66	5	0	0	4	0	66			2155-5435			WOS:000506725100030		
J	Hirayama, Tasuku								Fluorescent probes for the detection of catalytic Fe(II) ion								FREE RADICAL BIOLOGY AND MEDICINE				133		SI		38	45		10.1016/j.freeradbiomed.2018.07.004				MAR 2019	2019	Iron (Fe) is the most abundant redox-active metal ion in the human body, and its redox-active inter-convertible multiple oxidation states contributes to numerous essential biological processes. Moreover, iron overload can potentially cause cellular damage and death, as wel as numerous diseases through the aberrant production of highly reactive oxidative species (hROS). Protein-free or weakly-protein-bound Fe ions play a pivotal role as catalytic reactants of the Fenton reaction. In this reaction, hROS, such as hydroxyl radicals and high valent-iron-oxo species, are generated by a reaction between hydrogen peroxide and Fe(II), which is re-generated through reduction using abundant intracellular reductants, such as glutathione. This results in the catalytic evolution of hROS. Thus, selective detection of the catalytic Fe(II) in the living systems can explain both of the pathological and physiological functions of Fe(II). Written from the perspective of their modes of actions, this paper presents recent advances in the development of fluorescent and bioluminescent probes that can selectively detect catalytic Fe(II) together with their biological applications.									37	4	0	0	18	0	41			0891-5849	1873-4596		WOS:000457712300005	29990536

Antimony doped Bi2O3 films were deposited onto glass substrate from bismuth nitrate and antimony precursor solutions. As chelating agent polyethyleneglycol (PEG) was used and the above-mentioned precursor solutions were sufficiently viscous.Crystallization behavior and microstructure evolutions of the obtained films were investigated using spectroscopic ellipsometry (SE), polarized microscope observation, X-ray diffractometry (XRD), and infrared spectrometry (IR). The thickness and the porosity of the films were evaluated.The preparation techniques differ mainly in precursor materials and method of deposition, leading to different quality of the resulting films.					8th Conference of the European-Ceramic-Society8th Conference of the European-Ceramic-Society	JUN 29-JUL 03, 2003JUN 29-JUL 03, 2003	Turkish Ceram Soc; European Ceram SocTurkish Ceram Soc; European Ceram Soc	Istanbul, TURKEYIstanbul, TURKEY	1	0	0	0	0	0	1			1013-9826		0-87849-946-6	WOS:000223059700295

However, knowledge about the thermal stability of CeO2 is still deficient. Here, we conduct in-situ transmission electron microscopy experiments and theoretical calculations to elucidate the thermal stability of CeO2 nanomaterials under different environments. A sinter (< 700 degrees C) and a structural decomposition (> 700 degrees C) are observed within CeO2 nanoflowers under O-2. The sinter firstly occurs among the nanoflowers' monomers and then the sintered nanoparticles structurally decompose to tiny nanoparticles from the strain interface. Under a vacuum environment, the CeO2 nanoflowers firstly undergo a transition from cubic fluorite CeO2 to hexagonal Ce2O3, accompanied by the oxygen release. The Ce2O3 nanoparticles further atomically sublimate from the edges to the center under high temperatures. Theoretical calculation results reveal a considerably lower energy barrier for the structural decomposition under O-2 and for the sublimation under vacuum. This work provides a perspective on the structural design and performance optimization of CeO2-based catalysts.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			1998-0124	1998-0000		WOS:000682660400010

Principal dissociation and recombination products were analysed by optical emission spectroscopy (OES) and mass spectrometry (MS) for different experimental conditions. Actinometric measurements were used to test the tail of the Electronic Energy Distribution Function (EEDF) and to estimate the main creation and destruction processes of some excited states. Electronic temperature variation was estimated in nitrogen plasmas by emission spectroscopy measurements and chemical titration was used to determinate atomic nitrogen rate in N2 and N2-Ar post-discharge regions. Most part of these diagnostics were associated with infrared spectroscopy (IRS) and chemical composition analysis of the amorphous C-H(N) films deposited on SiO2 or Zr substrates. Emission spectroscopy and mass spectrometry analyses of an oxygen plasma created after deposition processes have permitted to estimate N, C and H evolution relative rates in the film, as a function of experimental parameters. Correlations between the plasma chemistry processes and film properties were used to suggest experimental conditions permitting to create a higher concentration of carbonitride species in the gaseous phase and to increase nitrogen rate in the film.					11th International Conference on Gas Discharges and their Applications11th International Conference on Gas Discharges and their Applications	11-15 Sept. 199511-15 Sept. 1995		Tokyo, JapanTokyo, Japan	0	0	0		0	0	0			0385-4205			INSPEC:5500721

Due to the energy and environmental problems, the renewable energy resources have critical importance. Owing to their exceptional properties, including very high electrical conductivity and thermal stability, MXenes are finding increasing applications in energy conversion and storage devices to solve the energy problems of modern society. In this review, we aim to provide a timely snapshot of recent advances in the synthesis, design, and engineering of MXene-based materials for the energy sector. Strategies for optimizing the performance of MXenes materials in energy applications, such as surface nano-engineering and compositing with 0D, 1D, 2D, and/or 3D materials are explored in the context of key energy conversion and storage devices. To fulfil the basic requirement of renewable energy devices, electrocatalysis of small molecular reactions such as ORR, OER, HER, NRR, and CO2RR, are comprehensively discussed on MXene-based electrode materials. Further, the MXene-based electrode materials for energy storage devices such as metalion batteries (Na+, Li+, K+, etc.), Li-S batteries and supercapacitors, are also summarized. Finally, challenges and future opportunities for MXenes in these different energy applications are discussed.

Photodegradation of folates may have played a role in the development of different human skin colours. 5MTHF can be degraded directly by exposure to ultraviolet radiation or by exposure to visible light in the presence of endogenous sensitizers like riboflavin (RF). These photochemical reactions were studied by absorption spectroscopy. While 5MTHF is stable under UV and visible light exposure in pure aqueous media, it is quickly degraded in the presence of RF during UVA and blue light exposure. The degradation of 5MTHF is dependent on the concentration of RF, but not on the concentration of 5MTHF itself. UVA and blue light gave similar reactions. Further investigations are necessary to evaluate the consequences of large light exposures in vivo in humans. Our findings should be taken into the ongoing discussion about the development of human skin colours. Due to the presence of RF in human blood, folate can be significantly degraded during prolonged or intense blue light exposure. Thus, a dark skin colour may be favourable for prevention of folate degradation under high solar fluence rates, such as in equatorial areas.									36	0	1	0	24	0	37			1474-905X	1474-9092		WOS:000257426200008	18597029

Herein, pure phase Fe5C2 magnetic materials with different morphologies were prepared by a simple ethylenediamine carbonization method. This method included the preparation of FeC2O4 center dot 2H(2)O precursors with different morphologies and the co-calcination process of ethylenediamine and the precursors. At the same time, the optimum experimental conditions for the formation of pure phase Fe5C2 particles with different morphologies were investigated. More importantly, the magnetic properties of Fe5C2 particles and the electrocatalytic activities of Fe5C2 particles as electrocatalysts for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) are improved by adjusting the morphologies of Fe5C2 particles. The saturation magnetization (M-s) and coercivity (H-c) of Fe5C2 particle with the cuboid rod-like structure can reach 134.53 emu/g and 305.93 Oe, respectively, demonstrating good soft magnetic properties at 298 K. Simultaneously, the Fe5C2 particle with the porous cuboid rod-like structure exhibits efficient HER activity (225 mV for j = - 10 mA cm(-2)). In this work, a simple and generalized Fe5C2 particle synthesis method is proposed, and new explorations are provided for the further applications of Fe5C2 particles with different morphologies in the fields of magnetism and catalysis.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0957-4522	1573-482X		WOS:000721662500001

The development of effective electrocatalysts and a corresponding working mechanism during cycling are critically important for lithium-oxygen batteries. Here, a single cobalt atom electrocatalyst is synthesized for lithium-oxygen batteries by a polymer encapsulation strategy. The isolated moieties of single atom catalysts can effectively regulate the distribution of active sites to form micrometre-sized flower-like lithium peroxide and promote the decomposition of lithium peroxide by a one-electron pathway. The battery with single cobalt atoms can operate with high round-trip efficiency (86.2%) and long-term stability (218 days), which is superior to a commercial 5wt% platinum/carbon catalyst. We reveal that the synergy between a single atom and the support endows the catalyst with excellent stability and durability. The promising results provide insights into the design of highly efficient catalysts for lithium-oxygen batteries and greatly expand the scope of future investigation. Li-O-2 batteries represent one of the promising paths toward high energy density battery systems. Here the authors synthesize single atom Co electrocatalysts to regulate the formation and decomposition of the major discharge product Li2O2, realizing high round-trip efficiency and stability in a Li-O-2 cell.									105	11	0	0	3	0	109			2041-1723			WOS:000533952200009	32366827

The thermal performance of EP thermosets was performed via thermogravimetric analysis coupled with Fourier transformation infrared spectroscopy (TG-FTIR). The results showed that the presence of Lig-F had significant influence on thermal stability (tested by TG) and flame retardancy (determined by limited oxygen index, vertical burning and cone calorimeter) of EP thermosets. H-1 NMR and FTIR analyses confirmed the successful synthesis of flame retardant (DOPO-PA) and modification of lignin, and the evolution of gas produced by thermal decomposition was different with different quantities of Lig-F added. Finally, the activation energy (E) of cured 10% Lig-F/EP was measured by two different methods, namely Flynn-Wall-Ozawa and Kissinger-Akahira-Sunoe, which was obviously higher than that of neat EP.									5	0	0	0	1	0	5			1388-6150	1588-2926		WOS:000663699100003

In addition to the constituent elements and hence intrinsic activity, the morphology, porosity, and specific surface area of a nanostructured catalyst would substantially impact its overall electrocatalytic performance. In this paper, we report a facile and rapid two-step microwave-assisted anion-exchange route to prepare nanostructured CoS. By simply controlling the microwave sulfurization time, CoS of various morphologies such as hollow prisms, broken prisms, and nanoparticles could be obtained. Importantly, the correlation between morphology and HER activity of CoS in neutral water was systematically studied through a set of material characterization and electrochemical techniques. It's revealed that the morphology of CoS changed from hollow nanoprisms to 3D nanoparticles when increasing the microwave sulfurization time from 5 to 60 min. The results demonstrated that CoS with 3D nanoparticle morphology, prepared by microwave sulfurization of 30 min, possessed the largest specific surface area and electrochemically active surface area. These nanostructured features resulted in the promoted accessibility of active sites, enhanced mass/charge transport and easier release of hydrogen bubbles, rendering its highest HER activity and excellent stability and showing small overpotentials of 233, 314, and 364 mV to achieve current densities of 10, 50, and 100 mA cm(-2), respectively, in neutral water.									28	2	0	0	4	0	29			2052-1553			WOS:000371162200010

Here we demonstrate a "hitting three birds with one stone" method to synthesize less toxic metallic WO2-carbon mesoporous nanowires with high concentration of oxygen vacancies (OVs) via calcination of inorganic/organic WO3-ethylenediamine hybrid precursors. The products exhibit excellent performance for Fly generation: the onset overpotential is only 35 mV, the required overpotentials for 10 and 20 mA/cm(2) are 58 and 78 mV, the Tafel Slope is 46 mV/decade, the exchange current density is 0.64 mA/cm(2), and the Stability is over 10 h. Further studies, in combination with density functional theory, demonstrate that the unusual electronic structure and the large amount of active sites, generated by the high concentration of OVs, As well as the Closely attached carbon materials, were key factors for excellent performance. Our results experimentally and theoretically establish metallic transition metal. oxides (TMOs) as intriguing novel eleetrocatalysts for H-2 generation. Such TMOs with OVs might be promising candidates for other energy storage and conversion applications.									378	17	0	0	17	0	382			0002-7863	1520-5126		WOS:000356322300003	25992910

Herein, a CQDs/Au/TiO2 nanorod array composite photoanode was constructed with special attention to local photothermal effects. The intensity and characteristics of the local thermal effect generated by the photothermal conversion of plasmonic Au nanoparticles (Au NPs) and carbon quantum dots (CQDs) are accurately represented by an equivalent simplified temperature field model constructed innovatively. Further studies demonstrated that the local thermal effect not only stimulates the activity of the small polaron semiconductor TiO2, but also accelerates the charge transfer and surface dynamic reaction from the aspects of kinetics and thermodynamics. Simulation and experimental results also showed that the surface plasmon resonance (SPR) effect of Au NPs and the up-conversion fluorescence characteristics of CQDs can cooperate to improve the carrier concentration. Meanwhile, the formation of a Schottky heterojunction between Au and TiO2, and CQDs as hole collectors synergistically promoted the bulk charge separation. Therefore, the CQDs/Au/TiO2 photoanode achieved a remarkable H-2 evolution rate of 641.9 mu L h(-1) cm(-2) under AM 1.5 illumination, five times higher than that of the pure TiO2 photoanode.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			2044-4753	2044-4761		WOS:000750936500001

Nevertheless, some fundamental issues are yet to be fully understood and a comprehensive mastering of their solid-state chemistry, kinetics and thermal stability is required. Here, we select a high capacity cation-disordered positive electrode-Li1.2Ni0.4Nb0.4O2 as a model compound to study intrinsic reaction mechanism, including charge compensation mechanism, kinetics, thermal stability, and structural evolution. By combining soft and hard X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) with operando and exsitu differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), galvanostatic intermittent titration technique (GITT), cyclic voltammetry (CV), and X-ray diffraction (XRD), we present holistic information on disordered rock-salt cathode. This work provides beneficial insights into designing and tailoring new positive electrodes with disordered rock-salt structure.

The up-conversion of infrared light into visible light is a probable strategy to utilize NIR in solar energy storage and conversion into hydrogen. Herein, a cooperative photocatalyst consisting of RGO, CdS and an up-conversion component (NaYF4-Yb3+/Er3+) has been identified as an excellent photocatalyst for overall water splitting to hydrogen. By uniting an up-conversion component with a visible light catalyst, a cooperative catalyst has been developed and 980 nm NIR driven water splitting has been achieved. RGO and CN were selected, and their water splitting performances based on their incorporation into combined catalysts were compared. The results indicated that only RGO had a significant promotion effect on photocatalytic water splitting activity due to its good conductivity on its huge net-like 2D structure. A highest hydrogen evolution rate of 4.54 mu mol g(-1) h(-1) was achieved.									7	2	0	0	0	0	7			2044-4753	2044-4761		WOS:000530288800005		
J	Wang ChangJian; Xu ShengLi; Jia GuangMing								Laser-induced spark ignition of H-2/O-2/Ar mixtures								SCIENCE IN CHINA SERIES E-TECHNOLOGICAL SCIENCES				50	6			797	806		10.1007/s11431-007-0034-0				DEC 2007	2007	Laser-induced spark ignition of hydrogen-oxygen-argon mixtures was experimentally investigated using a Q-swiched Nd:YAG laser to break down the gas at 532 nm. The laser-based high-speed schlieren system was employed to record flame front evolution for the gas mixtures with different initial pressure or laser output energy or argon dilution. The results show that the breakdown of the gas leads to the generation of ellipsoidal plasma. The rarefaction waves create the toroidal rings at the leading and trailing edges of the plasma, which provides a reasonable explanation for inward wrinkle of the plasma and the resultant flame. The toroidal rings at leading edge decays more rapidly and a gas lobe is generated that moves towards the laser. The hot gas in the plasma induces the generation of the spark kernel. Affected by the very weak shock wave or compression waves reflected off the wall, the initial laminar flame decelerates. The arc flame front interactions with the wall, reversed shock wave or compression waves, rarefaction waves, etc. induce the transition from laminar flame to turbulent one. These induce the transition from laminar flame to turbulent flame. For stoichiometric hydrogen-oxygen mixtures diluted by 76.92% argon at an initial pressure of 53.33 kPa, the minimum output energy of the laser is 15 mJ for successful laser-induced spark ignition. With increasing initial pressure or the output energy of the laser, or decreasing argon dilution, the speed of the flame front increases.									4	0	0	0	1	0	4			1006-9321			WOS:000251020400009

Upon adsorption at 120 K two different SO2 species were detected, which were identified as upright-standing and flat-lying molecules by comparing the calculated core level shifts. In agreement with the relative stabilities determined by the calculations the intensities of the photoelectron spectra indicate that the majority species are upright-standing SO2. Upon heating the quantitative analysis of the data indicates desorption of SO3 and formation of atomic sulfur. On the oxygen precovered surface small amounts of SO3 are formed already upon SO2 adsorption at low temperatures. Upon heating stepwise oxidation of SO2 to SO3 and, eventually, to SO4 is found. Two different SO4 species were detected, which are assigned to SO4 bound in the proximity of or remote from oxygen adatoms, according to core level shift estimates.									18	2	0	0	0	0	18			1463-9076	1463-9084		WOS:000294441900016	21826326

These reactions are accompanied by a change in batch volume, the release of several (batch) gases and occurrence of melting phases, gas bubbles and foam. Evolution of gas species, such as CO, CO2, O-2, and SO2 can be monitored as a function of temperature. From this information, the reaction mechanisms and temperatures can be derived during the fusion of the batch into a molten glass.CelSian developed and uses experimental equipment to enable the observation of the melting-in of a batch in transparent vitreous crucibles and simultaneous analysis of the evolved gases from the batch during heating up, melting and fining. The furnace atmosphere during melting and fining is controlled and the effect of different batch compositions on the temperature of fining-onset and fining gas production can be measured. For instance, changes in the furnace atmosphere can strongly influence the fining temperatures and fining efficiency.The equipment is applied to study the effect of:Batch pretreatment, such as grinding of the batch or pelletizing;Addition of cokes or different sulfate/ coke ratios in the batch;Exchange one raw material for another type;Changing oxygen or water vapor level in the furnace atmosphere;Batch humidification;Addition of oxidizing agent;on the melting-in behavior, foam formation and fining gas release. The experimental facility and method will be described in this paper and a few relevant examples for industrial glass production will be shown and discussed.This experimental method provides important information for glass technologists to optimize the raw material chemistry and glass melting conditions to improve melting and fining whilst limiting foam formation. This paper shows and discusses the application of this equipment to examine the effect of batch preparation techniques (coarse, fine batch, pellets) on melting-in and fining behavior.					74th Glass Problems Conference (GPC)74th Glass Problems Conference (GPC)	OCT 14-17, 2013OCT 14-17, 2013	Alfred Univ, Kazuo Inamori Sch EngnAlfred Univ, Kazuo Inamori Sch Engn	Columbus, OHColumbus, OH	5	0	0	0	0	0	5					978-1-118-93296-4; 978-1-118-93297-1	WOS:000350550900007

However, the water splitting efficiency needs further improvement, which can be achieved by boosting the exciton dissociation and charge transfer. Herein, a gelatin-confined strategy is developed to construct 3D tube-assembled g-C3N4 open frameworks. The gelatin plays multiple roles in the thermal polymerization. It not only engineers the grain growth of g-C3N4, but also supplies in situ external C and O sources. Experimental and density functional theory (DFT) calculation results indicate that the self-integration effects of the unique 3D architecture and bridging electron delocalization channels lead to prompt exciton production and dissociation, and subsequent carrier transfer. Consequently, the g-C3N4 open framework achieves a hydrogen evolution rate of 99.4 mu mol h(-1) and an apparent quantum efficiency of 7.43% at 450 nm, significantly superior to previously reported C and (or) O-doped 2D g-C3N4 and other 3D g-C3N4 materials. These findings provide promising guidance for designing efficient 3D architectures to drive photocatalysis and support the broader application of cost-effective biopolymers.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			2044-4753	2044-4761		WOS:000744624300001

Recently, LDH nanosheets have been shown to be very effective for photocatalytic N(2)reduction to NH(3)using water as the reducing agent. Herein, it is demonstrated that a simple pretreatment of ZnCr-LDH, ZnAl-LDH, and NiAl-LDH nanosheets with aqueous NaOH can greatly enhance the concentration of oxygen vacancies and low coordination metal centers in the nanosheets, thus significantly enhancing their photocatalytic activity for N(2)reduction to NH(3)under UV-vis irradiation (without the need for added sacrificial agents or cocatalysts). The facile alkali etching strategy introduced here is expected to be widely adopted in the future development of high-performance LDH photocatalysts for ammonia production and other challenging chemical transformations (e.g., CO(2)reduction and water splitting).									95	6	0	0	4	0	96			1614-6832	1614-6840		WOS:000552301300001

The Mott-Schottky effect between a metal with larger work function and n-type semiconductor with a higher Fermi level will facilitate the electron transfer from the semiconductor toward the metal. As a result, it is possible to design optimal H* adsorption active sites with thermoneutral hydrogen adsorption free energy (DGH*). Herein, MoC nanoparticles with a diameter of about 3.4 nm embedded in N, P-codoped carbon were converted from well-defined polyoxometalates (around 1 nm) and polypyrrole nanocomposites by carbonization and further wrapped on the surface of CNTs. On the basis of improved electron transfer rate, increased carrier densities, and enhanced active site activities on MoC after lowering the work function due to the Mott-Schottky effect with n-type domains in N, P-codoped carbon, our electrocatalysts could drive the current density of 10 mA cm-2 at 175 mV with a Tafel slope of 62 mV dec-1 and TOF value of 1.49 s-1 at 150 mV, as well as long-term H2 production stability. The present study provides a new guideline for the design and preparation of Mott-Schottky HER electrocatalysts.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2398-4902			INSPEC:21389513

At low doses, at an adsorption temperature of 140 K, HCOOH decomposed to yield CO, CO2, H-2 and H2O during TPD. CO and H-2 were evolved in desorption-limited peaks at 470 and 320 K, respectively. The CO and H2O desorptions were saturated at very low doses indicating only a small degree of formate dehydration in such a transient experiment. The CO2 and H-2 evolution continued to increase with dose and the CO2 evolved in a decomposition-limited peak at 237 K at low doses which broadened to lower temperature with increasing coverage. This dehydrogenation of HCOOH was of first order with an activation energy of 40 kJ mol-1. At doses above 0.5 L molecularly chemisorbed HCOOH was observed to desorb at 210 K and at still higher doses physisorbed multilayers were present and desorbed at 180 K. XPS confirmed the presence of CO above 250 K and formate below this temperature. When oxygen was pre-dosed the formate was significantly stabilized and its coverage increased, the CO desorption was removed and H-2 was produced at higher temperatures at the expense of the H-2 peak at 320 K.					9TH INTERDISCIPLINARY SURFACE SCIENCE CONF ( ISSC-9 )9TH INTERDISCIPLINARY SURFACE SCIENCE CONF ( ISSC-9 )	APR 22-24, 1991APR 22-24, 1991	BRIT PETR RES; CADBURN; ELSEVIER; SHELL RES; UNILEVER RES; RON UNWIN, SCI INSTRUMENT CONSULTANT; USAF, EUROPEAN OFF AEROSP RES & DEV; VACUUM GENERATORSBRIT PETR RES; CADBURN; ELSEVIER; SHELL RES; UNILEVER RES; RON UNWIN, SCI INSTRUMENT CONSULTANT; USAF, EUROPEAN OFF AEROSP RES & DEV; VACUUM GENERATORS	SOUTHAMPTON, ENGLANDSOUTHAMPTON, ENGLAND	33	1	0	0	1	0	33			0953-8984			WOS:A1991GU83100045

Eight fractions corresponding to eight potential oxidation dimeric products were detected. The fractions profiles were compared with profiles obtained with two other oxidoreductases: polyphenoloxidase extracted from grapes and laccase from Botrytis cinerea. The profiles were very similar, although some minor differences suggested possible dissimilarities in the reactivity of these enzymes. Five fractions were then isolated and analyzed by 1D and 2D NMR spectroscopy. The addition of traces of cadmium nitrate in the samples solubilized in acetone-d(6) led to fully resolved NMR signals of phenolic protons, allowing the unambiguous structural determination of six reaction products, one of the fractions containing two enantiomers. These products can further be used as oxidation markers to investigate their presence and evolution in wine during winemaking and wine ageing.									2	0	0	0	1	0	2				1420-3049		WOS:000714475100001	34684746

Early after ischemia, perivascular astrocytes release cytokines and activate metalloproteases (MMPs) that contribute to blood brain barrier (BBB) disruption and vasogenic oedema; whereas at later stages, they provide extracellular glutamate uptake, BBB regeneration and neurotrophic factors release. Similarly, early activation of microglia contributes to ischemic brain injury via the production of inflammatory cytokines, including tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and interleukin (IL)-1, reactive oxygen and nitrogen species and proteases. Nevertheless, microglia also contributes to the resolution of inflammation, by releasing IL-10 and tumor growth factor (TGF)-beta, and to the late reparative processes by phagocytic activity and growth factors production. Indeed, after ischemia, microglia/macrophages differentiate toward several phenotypes: the M1 pro-inflammatory phenotype is classically activated via toll-like receptors or interferon-gamma, whereas M2 phenotypes are alternatively activated by regulatory mediators, such as ILs 4, 10, 13, or TGF-beta. Thus, immune cells exert a dualistic role on the evolution of ischemic brain damage, since the classic phenotypes promote injury, whereas alternatively activated M2 macrophages or N2 neutrophils prompt tissue remodeling and repair. Moreover, a subdued activation of the immune system has been involved in ischemic tolerance, since different preconditioning stimuli act via modulation of inflammatory mediators, including toll-like receptors and cytokine signaling pathways. This further underscores that the immuno-modulatory approach for the treatment of ischemic stroke should be aimed at blocking the detrimental effects, while promoting the beneficial responses of the immune reaction.									139	11	0	0	100	0	147				1662-453X		WOS:000353649500001	25972779

An aqueous solution containing reactants was produced to ensure the combustion reaction taking place at the molecular level. A suite of characterization techniques, including X-ray diffraction, Raman, transmission electron spectroscopy, as well as X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES), is employed to investigate the structural and phase changes of the series. Both X-ray and electron diffraction patterns show that the Y2HfxTi2-xO7 system undergoes a clear composition-induced phase transition from ordered pyrochlore to disordered defect-fluorite at x similar to 1.5. On the other hand, Raman and XANES spectra reveal a gradual evolution of the local structure with the substitution of Hf for Ti. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd and Techna Group S.r.l.

Herein, a series of transition metal (M = Mn-Cu, Ru-Ag) doped C3N monolayer (M-C3N) as a novel CO2ER catalyst has been investigated by employing the density functional method. By a careful computational screening, Mn-C3N is identified as the best catalyst for CO2ER, due to its high catalytic activity and high selectivity. HCOOH is the final product with a low overpotential of 0.04 V and a low kinetic energy barrier of 0.75 eV. The hydrogen evolution is also suppressed on Mn-C3N surface. Therefore, the CO2ER activity could be tuned by adjusting the metal atom in the C3N monolayer, which may shed new light on designing novel C3N-based CO2ER catalyst.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000608537500003

The importance of this enzyme to life on Earth has ironically been paralleled by the elusiveness of a detailed understanding of its precise catalytic mechanism. Computational investigations have in recent years provided more and more insights into the structural and mechanistic details that underlie the workings of PSII. This review will present an overview of some of these studies, focusing on those that have aimed at elucidating the mechanism of water oxidation at the CaMn4 cluster in PSII, and those exploring the features of the structure and dynamics of this enzyme that enable it to catalyse this energetically demanding reaction.

Tenuous exospheres with relatively dense surface layers are likely to form around more massive icy satellites, such as, for example, the Galilean satellites Europa and Ganymede in the Jovian system. Escaping exospheres are formed in the case of low-mass icy moons, as happens for the icy satellite Enceladus in the Saturnian system. The main parent component of such gaseous envelopes is water vapor, which enters into the atmosphere as a result of thermal degassing processes, nonthermal radiolysis, and other active processes and phenomena on the icy surface of a satellite. A numerical kinetic model has been developed to study on a molecular level the processes of the formation, chemical evolution, and dynamics of tenuous gaseous envelopes dominated mainly by H2O. The ionization processes in such tenuous gaseous envelopes are caused by solar ultraviolet (UV) radiation and solar-wind and/or magnetospheric plasma. The primary processes when ultraviolet solar photons and plasma electrons affect the tenuous gas of the H2O-dominated atmosphere are responsible for the chemical diversity of the gaseous envelopes of icy moons. Ionization chemistry, including ion-molecular reactions, dissociative recombination of molecular ions, and the reactions of the charge exchange with magnetospheric ions, is important for the formation of chemical diversity in gaseous envelopes of icy satellites. The model considered in the study was used to numerically simulate the formation and development of chemical diversity in the tenuous gaseous envelope of Enceladus. The numerical results were compared to the direct Cassini measurements during its close flyby near Enceladus.									11	0	0	0	0	0	11			0038-0946	1608-3423		WOS:000261176900002

Our Fe abundances were derived in LTE and then corrected for non-LTE (NLTE) effects. The new oxygen abundances confirm previous findings for a progressive linear rise in the oxygen-to-iron ratio with a slope -0.33 +/- 0.02 from solar metallicity to [Fe/H] similar to -3. A slightly higher slope would be obtained if the Fe NLTE corrections were not considered. Below [Fe/H] = -2.5 our stars show [O/Fe] ratios as high as similar to1.17 (G64-12), which can be interpreted as evidence for oxygen overproduction in the very early epoch of the formation of the halo, possibly associated with supernova events with very massive progenitor stars. We show that the arguments against this linear trend given by Fulbright & Kraft in 1999, based on the LTE Fe analysis of two metal-poor stars, cannot be sustained when an NLTE analysis is performed. We discuss how the Fulbright & Kraft LTE ionization balance of Fe lines underestimates the gravity of the very metal-poor star BD +23 degrees 3130 ([Fe/H] = -2.43) and how this leads to an underestimation of the oxygen abundance derived from the forbidden line. Gravities from Hipparcos appear to be in good agreement with those determined in NLTE, giving higher values than previously assumed, which reduces the discrepancies between the oxygen abundances determined from OH, triplet, and forbidden lines. Using one-dimensional models, our analysis of three oxygen indicators available for BD +23 degrees 3130 gives an average [O/Fe] ratio of 0.78(-0.18)(+0.15). The high oxygen abundances at very low metallicities do not pose a problem to theoretical modeling since there is a range of parameters in the calculations of nucleosynthesis yields from massive stars at low metallicities that can accommodate our results.									94	0	1	0	0	0	95			0004-637X	1538-4357		WOS:000168383600020

Both surface-treated and untreated carbon fibre reinforcements were investigated. The STEM/EELS technique was found to be a particularly useful characterization tool. The results of quantitative EELS linescans have been interpreted in terms of the migration of gaseous SiO and CO, produced by the reaction between the small amount of SiO2 and excess carbon within the PCS-derived SiC matrix, from the central matrix region towards the fibre-matrix interfaces, Generally, the migration of gaseous SiO and CO results in an enrichment of SiO2 at the region adjacent to the fibre-matrix interface. However, differing final composite microstructures are formed depending on the strength of the fibre-matrix bonding, In the case of strong fibre-matrix interfacial bending where few escape channels are present, a distinct Si-C-O layer was identified within the matrix adjacent to the fibre-matrix interface: both crystalline beta-SiC and the segregated Si-O-C phase coexist in this microstructure up to at least 1450 degrees C, In the case of weak fibre-matrix bonding this oxygen segregated interfacial layer is eventually removed at high enough temperatures. The final interfacial microstructure has important consequences for the mechanical properties of the composite material.

However, the formation of a crystalline disordered layer in BiVO4 and its effectiveness towards photoelectrochemical water splitting has remained a big challenge. Here, we report a rapid solution process (within 5s) that is able to form a disordered layer of a few nanometers thick on the surface of BiVO4 nanoparticles using a specific solution with a controllable reducing power. The disordered layer on BiVO4 alleviates charge recombination at the electrode-electrolyte interface and reduces the onset potential greatly, which in turn results in a photocurrent density of approximately 2.3 mA cm(-2) at 1.23 V versus the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE). This value is 2.1 times higher than that of bare BiVO4. The enhanced photoactivity is attributed to the increased charge separation and transfer efficiencies, which resolve the intrinsic drawbacks of bare BiVO4 such as the short hole diffusion length of around 100 nm and poor surface oxygen evolution reactivity.									28	1	0	0	2	0	28			1864-5631	1864-564X		WOS:000427005900015	29274301

The effects of subsequent catalytic ammonization pyrolysis upgrading of the torrefied biomass with Co/HZSM-5/HZSM-5 catalysts under an NH3/N2 atmosphere on product yield and N-containing compound selectivity were also evaluated with GC/MS and UV-fluorescence spectrometry. Furthermore, nitrogen fixation and migration mechanisms were also proposed in depth. The results showed that NH3 torrefaction was more effective in enhancing N fixation and retarding the release of N-containing volatiles in torrefied biochar (0.26%-9.43%) and reducing the oxygen content (43.18%-21.81%) via Maillard reactions compared with N2 torrefaction. With increasing torrefaction severity, the N-containing compound content, higher heating values (HHV), deoxygenation ratio (DEO) and nitrogen-doping ratio (NDR) increased, which were much higher than those of conventional N2 torrefaction. Higher temperatures promoted the evolution of graphitic-N and oxidized-N and reduced pyrrolic-N and pyridinic-N group formation in torrefied biochar. The maximum content of N-containing compounds of 88.71% was obtained at a torrefaction temperature of 275 degrees C under NH3 pyrolysis coupled with the Co/HZSM-5 catalyst, and was achieved via substrate interaction with the -Co-O-Si- catalyst sites and Maillard reactions. Furthermore, the N2 atmosphere combined with the HZSM-5 catalyst significantly promoted the conversion of HC compounds (~56.97% at 225 degrees C during N2 torrefaction), while the Co/HZSM-5 catalyst combined with the NH3 atmosphere significantly improved N-containing compound formation. NH3 pyrolysis facilitated the formation of pyrroles and pyrazines while reducing the formation of amides by deamination and dehydrogenation reactions. Cellulose was conducive to the transformation of pyrrole in NH3 pyrolysis, while lignin was conducive to the formation of aniline. These results could offer strategies to regulate nitrogen functional groups to enhance N-containing chemicals.									6	0	0	0	1	0	6			1743-9671	1746-0220		WOS:000792896900004

The XRD, UV-vis, SEM and PL results indicate that the introduction of phosphorus and oxygen enhances the specific surface area of graphitic carbon nitride (from 12.8 to 92.5 m(2) g(-1)), restrains the crystal growth, decreases the band gap energy (from 2.68 to 2.51 eV) and increases the separation efficiency of photogenerated electrons and holes, which increases the anoxic photocatalytic RhB degradation constants by approximately 27 times under visible light. Oxygen doping not only promotes the adsorption ability of reactant but also captures the photogenerated electrons to produce photogenerated holes for RhB degradation under anoxic condition.

Herein, ultralong hollow chain-ball-like carbon nitride implanted with oxygen (OCNT) was prepared through a facile supramolecular self-assembly route. The ultralong hollow chain-ball-like structure results in enhanced photoinduced charge carrier separation. In particular, the implantation of oxygen into the chemical backbone leads to the formation of a midgap state, which can more effectively capture visible light. The H-2 production rate (HPR) of OCNT is 5.47 mmol h(-1) g(-1), which is much higher than that of BCN by a factor of 14.0 under visible light irradiation. Moreover, BCN displays the very low HPR with values close to zero, while OCNT exhibits much superior efficiency (1.62 mmol h(-1) g(-1)) under long visible light illumination (lambda > 510 nm). The current research results may furnish fresh insights into the exploration of carbon nitride with different morphologies for high solar energy utilization. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

The substituted niobate crystallizes in an orthorhombic symmetry and the semiconducting and photo-electrochemical properties are investigated for the first time. The oxide exhibits a dark brown color and the UV-Visible spectroscopy gives an optical gap of 1.42 eV, due to the crystal field splitting of Cu2+ in octahedral site. The thermal variation of the conductivity shows that Nb: 4d-electrons are localized and the data are fitted by a small-polaron hopping model sigma = sigma(o) exp {- 0.053 eV/kT} with a carrier density thermally activated. The capacitance measurement done in ionic electrolyte (Na2SO4, 10(-2) M) indicates n type semiconductor with mixed valences Nb5+/4+, due to the hetero-valent substitution Li+ /Cu2+, with a flat band potential of 0.28 V-SCE and electrons density of 2.17x10(17) cm(-3). The Nyquist diagram shows mainly the bulk contribution with a diffusion process. The valence band (6.39 eV below vacuum) derives from O-2-: 2p orbital with a small admixture of Cu2+: 3d character while the conduction band is made up of Nb5+: 4d orbital.

In general, marine, biotaparticularly in euphotic and dysphotic zonesdepends directly or indirectly on light, but ultraviolet radiation (UV-R) can damage vital molecular machineries. UV-R induces the formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and impairs intracellular structures and enzymatic reactions. It can also affect organismal physiologies and eventually alter trophic chains at the ecosystem level. In Antarctica, physical drivers, such as sunlight, sea-ice, seasonality and low temperature are particularly influencing as compared to other regions. The springtime ozone depletion over the Southern Ocean makes organisms be more vulnerable to UV-R. Nonetheless, Antarctic species seem to possess analogous UV photoprotection and repair mechanisms as those found in organisms from other latitudes. The lack of data on species-specific responses towards increased UV-B still limits the understanding about the ecological impact and the tolerance levels related to ozone depletion in this region. The photobiology of Antarctic biota is largely unknown, in spite of representing a highly promising reservoir in the discovery of novel cosmeceutical products. This review compiles the most relevant information on photoprotection and UV-repair processes described in organisms from the Southern Ocean, in the context of this unique marine polar environment.									26	0	0	0	23	1	27				1660-3397		WOS:000445636600047	30223486

In order to evaluate our ability to determine C and O isotope compositions of siderite in modern sediments and soils containing immature organic matter, we prepared and analyzed synthetic samples made of variable proportions of pure siderite and yeast (selected for representing an immature organic matter because of its potential high reactivity to H3PO4 digestion). Replicate analyses of CO2 produced by phosphoric acid (H3PO4) digestion of our pure siderite standard at 130 degrees C provided delta C-13(sid) and delta O-18(sid) values of -12.3 +/- 0.1 parts per thousand and -16.2 +/- 0.3 parts per thousand (2 sigma) relative to PDB. Analysis of the synthetic sample mixtures shows delta C-13 and delta O-18 values undistinguishable from those of pure siderite within uncertainties, for proportion of yeast in the mixture equal to or lower than 10wt.% (corresponding to similar to 5wt.% of total organic carbon). In contrast, samples with proportions of yeast higher than 10wt.% were progressively shifted to more negative values (down to -21.8 parts per thousand for C and -19.6 parts per thousand for O) with increasing proportion of yeast, as a result of an increasing contribution of CO2 produced by the reaction of yeast with H3PO4 at 130 degrees C. Although in the case of natural samples this organic matter CO2 contribution probably strongly depends on both organic matter source organisms and diagenetic history, our data indicate that the removal of organic matter prior to siderite analysis may be often required. We thus tested three different methods for organic matter removal on our synthetic samples, using either oxidation in solution with NaOCl or H2O2, or oxidation in low temperature oxygen-plasma ashing system. For both methods based on oxidation in aqueous solution, we show that the determination of delta C-13 and delta O-18 is improved for concentration of yeast lower than 75 wt.% in the "siderite-yeast" mixture but is still shifted to lower values by 4.1 and 0.7 parts per thousand for C and O respectively, for a yeast proportion higher than 75 wt.%. Moreover, these two methods induce partial siderite dissolution, preventing determination of siderite content in the samples. The best method of yeast removal for coupled C and O isotopes analysis is the oxidation by low-temperature oxygen-plasma ashing, which strongly improves the accuracy of the delta C-13 and delta O-18 measurements and perfectly preserves siderite. In conclusion, any study of siderite isotope composition in organic-rich samples should include an evaluation of the need for organic matter removal using low-temperature oxygen-plasma ashing, the only method shown here to be efficient while preserving the siderite.

Nevertheless, conventional hazardous fluoride-based synthesis routes and the intense intralayer bonding restrict the development of MXenes. Herein, a fluoride-free, facile, and rapid method for synthesizing self-assembled 1D architecture from an MXene-based compound is reported. The MXene nanowire (NW) not only provides a robust connection to the flexible substrate but also effectively increases the electrochemically active surface area. The kinetics-favorable structure yields a boosted performance for the hydrogen/oxygen evolution reaction and the intake of the zinc ion. The 1D NW based on MXene compound maintains high stability in a quite low overpotential of 236 mV for 24 h without detachment from the substrate and manifests an exceptional high-power density of 420 W kg(-1) over 150 cycles as a flexible aqueous zinc ion battery. This work paves a novel and non-toxic synthesis method for the 1D nanofiber structure from MXene composition and demonstrates its multifunctional applications for energy conversion and storage.									36	4	0	0	5	0	37				2198-3844		WOS:000536690400018	32440484	
J	Lovato, Maria; Buffelli, Jose Real; Abrile, Mariana; Martin, Carlos								Kinetics and efficiency of ozone for treatment of landfill leachate including the effect of previous microbiological treatment								ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH				26	5			4474	4487		10.1007/s11356-018-1710-2				FEB 2019	2019	The application of conventional physicochemical and microbiological techniques for the removal of organic pollutants has limitations for its utilization on wastewaters as landfill leachates because of their high concentration of not easily biodegradable organic compounds. The use of ozone-based technologies is an alternative and complementary treatment for this type of wastewaters. This paper reports the study of the degradation of landfill leachates from different stages of a treatment plant using ozone and ozone + UV. The experimental work included the determination of the temporal evolution of COD, TOC, UV254, and color. Along the experimental runs, the instantaneous off-gas ozone concentration was measured. The reaction kinetics follows a global second order expression with respect to COD and ozone concentrations. A kinetic model which takes into account the gas liquid mass transfer coupled with the chemical reaction was developed, and the corresponding parameters of the reacting system were determined. The mathematical model is able to appropriately simulate COD and ozone concentrations but exhibiting limitations when varying the leachate type. The potential application of ozone was verified, although the estimated efficiencies for COD removal and ozone consumption as well as the effect of UV radiation show variations on their trends. In this sense, it is interesting to note that the relative ozone yield has significant oscillations as the reaction proceeds. Finally, the set of experimental results demonstrates the crucial importance of the selection of process conditions to improve ozone efficiencies. This approach should consider variations in the ozone supply in order to minimize losses as well as the design of exhaustion methods as multiple stage reactors using chemical engineering design tools.					3rd Iberoamerican Congress on Advanced Oxidation Technologies (CIPOA) . 2nd Colombian Conference on Advanced Oxidation Processes (CCPAOX)3rd Iberoamerican Congress on Advanced Oxidation Technologies (CIPOA) . 2nd Colombian Conference on Advanced Oxidation Processes (CCPAOX)	NOV 14-17, 2017NOV 14-17, 2017		Guatape, COLOMBIAGuatape, COLOMBIA	9	1	0	0	3	1	11			0944-1344	1614-7499		WOS:000458990300030	29557042

Since a very plausible mechanism for the oxygen-evolving complex involving the cuboidal Mn4Ca structure in photosystem II (PSII) has recently been established, the most important part of the present study concerns a detailed comparison between cobalt and manganese as water oxidation catalysts. One similarity found is that a M(IV)-O-center dot state is the key precursor for O-O bond formation in both cases. This means that simply getting a M(IV) state is not enough; a formal M(V)=O state is required, with two oxidations on one center from M(III). For cobalt, not even that is enough. A singlet coupled state is required at this oxidation level, which is not the ground state. It is shown that there are also more fundamental differences between catalysts based on these metals. The favorable low-barrier direct coupling mechanism found for PSII is not possible for the corresponding cobalt complexes. The origin of this difference is explained. For the only oxygen-evolving cubic Co4O4 complex with a defined structure, described by Dismukes et al., the calculated results are in good agreement with experiments. For the Co-4 models of the amorphous cobalt-oxo catalyst found by Nocera et al., higher barriers are found than the one obtained experimentally. The reasons for this are discussed.									90	0	0	0	22	0	90			0002-7863	1520-5126		WOS:000330163000033	23968287

In this study, Au-Cu2O heterostructure particles (HPs) with unique inter-embedded heterostructures were controllably fabricated by a universal reaction between Cu particles and HAuCl4 solution. Besides, the boosted catalytic performance from the plasmon effects, Au-Cu2O inter-embedded heterostructure exhibits additional structural advantages to promote the photocatalytic property of hydrogen generation overall water splitting. Under the visible light, the H-2 evolution rate of the Au-Cu2O HPs is 152 and 22 times higher than that of pure Cu2O and traditional Cu2O@Au HPs with Au anchored on the surface of Cu2O, respectively. On one hand, inter-embedded heterostructure brings more contact areas as the active sites to carry out the direct electron transfer and electromagnetic transfer for the reduction. On the other hand, the finite difference time domain (FDTD) simulations indicate that enhanced electromagnetic fields of Au-Cu2O HPs form a netlike structure to maximumly accelerate the transfer of hot electrons and separate the electron-hole pairs. Under the joint action of the two, the inter-embed heterostructure exhibits superior photocatalytic property, demonstrating that this study could instruct the design of other metal-semiconductor photocatalysts.									15	1	0	0	1	0	16			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000621647100003

But only relatively moderate CO2-reducing solar-to-fuel efficiency (eta(STF)<ca.18%) was achieved previously even using the most active gold-based electrocatalyst for the CO(2)reduction reaction (CO2RR), which is much lower than the current highest solar-to-hydrogen efficiency (eta(STH)= 30%). Here, we report a strategy based on a monolithic nanoporous silver-based membrane electrocatalyst (npm-Ag) to increase the density of active sites while breaking the three-phase diffusion-limit length of previous membrane electrodes, improving the effective thickness of the catalyst layer from tens of nanometers to several micrometers without any polymer additive. Thenpm-Ag showed exceptionally selective reduction of CO(2)to CO at low overpotentials (ca.80%@40 millivolts,ca.100%@90-290 millivolts). The catalyst also allowed a nearly full use of the photocurrent of the state-of-the-art solar cells and gave a projected maximum eta(STF)ofca.25%. Combined with a NiFe-based O-2-evolving anode, a stable CO2-reducing photosynthetic system with an eta(STF)ofca.20.1% was demonstrated experimentally for 28 hours in the absence of a DC/DC converter.									18	0	0	0	2	0	18			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000569873400039

Herein, we report the development of a bifunctional electrocatalyst having target-specific Fe-N-4/C and Co-N-4/C isolated active sites, exhibiting a symbiotic effect on overall oxygen electrocatalysis performances. The dualism of N-dopants and binary metals lower the d-band centers of both Fe and Co in the Fe,Co,N-C catalyst, improving the overpotential of the overall electrocatalytic processes (Delta EORR-OER = 0.74 +/- 0.02 V vs RHE). Finally, the Fe,Co,N-C showed a high areal power density of 198.4 mW cm(-2) and 158 mW cm(-2) in the respective liquid and solid-state Zn-air batteries (ZABs), demonstrating suitable candidature of the active material as air cathode material in ZABs.									7	0	0	0	0	0	7			1936-0851	1936-086X		WOS:000812148900066	35436090

The reliability of CPFD simulation was first validated by comparing fuel reactor (FR) outlet gases concentration and FR pressure profiles of experimental measurements with the corresponding simulation results. Then, the gas-solid reactive flow in the full-scale reactor was simulated in detail, and the results can help to rationalize reactor design and optimize operation. The evolution of bed inventory and solid circulation rate were carefully analyzed to understand the bed material rebalance phenomenon observed in simulation. The self-adjustment ability among different parts within the whole unit demonstrated the feasibility and stability of the 50 kWth CLC reactor. In addition, to have a better understanding on the relationships among the complex factors of hydrodynamics and reactions, the residence time distributions of oxygen carrier (OC) and char were attained. Based on these results, a higher FR was proposed as an optimization to improve the residence time of char in FR, so as to extend reaction path of both homogeneous and heterogeneous reactions therein. Finally, according to the simulation results of the combustible gases distribution and coal conversion trail within the reactor, the coal feeding location was optimized. It was found that the combustible gases in volatile plume cannot diffuse effectively throughout FR with only one coal feeding point, which was not conductive to the good mixing among OC and combustible gases. As an optimization, well mixed gas-solid contact was achieved with two oppositely-collocated coal feeding points. In summary, the CPFD simulation conducted in this work can help to optimize the reactor configuration and operation, which eventually achieved reliable prediction of the performance of the 50 kW(th) CLC reactor in an effective and economical way.					5th International Conference on Chemical Looping5th International Conference on Chemical Looping	SEP 24-27, 2018SEP 24-27, 2018		Park City, UTPark City, UT	19	2	0	0	1	0	21			1750-5836	1878-0148		WOS:000495026000027

The high content of sulfur in the fresh sample led to the formation of S-containing compounds in products whose evolution in the gas phase was monitored through GC-MS analysis. Pyrolytic gas is rich in CH4, CO, CO2, and H2S with the presence of other sulfur compounds in smaller amounts (i.e., CH3SH, CH3-S-CH3, SO2, COS, and CS2). Biochar morphology and elemental composition have been investigated by means of SEM and EDX. The carbon content reaches ~90% after pyrolysis at 550 degrees C, while the oxygen content showed a decreasing trend with increasing temperature. From GC-MS analysis, bio-oil resulted rich in alkyl-alkoxy phenols, together with (alkyl)dihydroxy benzenes and minor amounts of hydrocarbons and sulfur compounds. NaOH/H2O and EtOH/H2O extraction were performed with the aim of extracting phenolic-like compounds. Sodium hydroxide solution allowed a better but still incomplete extraction of phenolic compounds, leaving a bio-oil richer in sulfur.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2				1996-1073		WOS:000759127600001

Perovskite-type oxides with rich physicochemical properties and flexible structure are one of the most promising categories of heterogeneous catalysts to activate PMS, while appropriate structural tuning is key to develop highly active perovskite oxides for efficient wastewater treatment. Here, we propose a simple strategy based on facile high-temperature quenching to significantly improve activity of perovskite oxide LaCoO3-delta (LCO) for PMS activation. Such quenching process improves bivalent cobalt over the surface of LCO, enhances electron transfer rate, and increases surface oxygen defects, consequently improving the decomposition rate of PMS. Specifically, compared with LCO prepared from naturally cooling at 600 degrees C (LCO-600-C), directly quenched LCO sample (LCO-600-Q + C) shows more than 50% improvement in catalytic activity for phenol degradation. Sulfate radical and singlet oxygen are identified as the dominating reactive oxygen species (ROS) by in-situ electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy and radical scavenging experiments, but a different generating rate of SO4- over LCO-600-Q + C and LCO-600-C. Such a strategy may be suitable for the design and development of other type of materials.									6	0	0	0	1	0	6			1359-8368	1879-1069		WOS:000606481400016		
J	Ali, Maryum; Pervaiz, Erum; Rabi, Osama								Enhancing the Overall Electrocatalytic Water-Splitting Efficiency of Mo2C Nanoparticles by Forming Hybrids with UiO-66 MOF								ACS OMEGA				6	50			34219	34228		10.1021/acsomega.1c03115				DEC 21 2021	2021	For efficient electrocatalytic water-splitting, developing a nonprecious-metal-based stable and highly active material is the most challenging task. In this paper, we have devised a synthesis strategy for a hybrid catalyst composed of molybdenum carbide (Mo2C) and a Zr-based metal-organic framework (MOF) (UiO-66) via the solvothermal process. Synergistic effects between Mo2C and UiO-66 lead to a decrease in the hydrogen adsorption energy on the catalysts, and Mo2C/UiO-66 hybrids offer excellent catalytic activity in an alkaline environment for water-splitting. Particularly, the optimized Mo2C/UiO-66 hybrid, termed MCU-2 with 50:50 wt % of both components, displayed the best catalytic performance for both hydrogen and oxygen evolution reactions (HER/OER). It offered a small overpotential of 174.1 mV to attain a current density of 10 mA/cm(2) and a Tafel plot value of 147 mV/dec for HER. It also offered a low overpotential of around 180 mV to attain a current density of 20 mA/cm(2) and a Tafel plot value of 134 mV/dec for OER. Additionally, the catalyst was stable for over 24 h and similar to 1000 cycles with a very minute shift in performance, and the electrolyzer indicates that a potential of similar to 1.3 V is required to reach 10 mA/cm(2) current density. It can be inferred from the results that the Mo2C/UiO-66 hybrid is a promising candidate as a nonexpensive and active catalyst for overall electrocatalytic water-splitting as the devised catalyst exhibits enhanced kinetics for both OER and HER, a more exposed surface area, faster electron transport, and enhanced diffusion of the electrolyte.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			2470-1343			WOS:000757429500003	34963908

Their commercial development is still hindered by noble platinum (Pt) catalysts for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) at the cathode, which not only determine the energy conversion efficiency and service life but also are closely related to the cost and broad application of fuel cells. Given the bright and enormous future of fuel cells, ORR catalysts should possess highly efficient performance yet meet the acceptable Pt costs for large-scale application. Extensive efforts are concentrated on the optimization of Pt-based nanostructures and upgradation of functional carriers to achieve the low-cost and high-activity Pt-based catalysts. By improving the Pt utilization and accessible surface, reducing Pt consumption and catalyst costs, accelerating mass exchange and electron transfer, alleviating the corrosion and agglomeration of carriers and Pt, accompanying with the assistance of robust yet effective functional supports, the service level and life of Pt-based electrocatalysts would be significantly improved and fuel cells could get into commercial market covering broader applications.In this Account, we focus on the recent development of Pt-based catalysts to figure out the problems associated with ORR catalysts in fuel cells. Recent development of Pt-based catalysts is discussed in different stages: (1) multiscale development of Pt-based nanostructures; (2) multielement regulation over Pt-based alloy composition; (3) upgradation of carbon and noncarbon support architectures; (4) development of integrated Pt-based catalysts for fuel cells. Finally, we propose some future issues (such as reaction mechanism, dynamic evolutions, and structure-activity relationship) for Pt-based catalysts, which mainly involve the preparation strategy of Pt-integrated catalysts (combination of Pt nanostructures with nanocarbons), performance evaluation (standard measurement protocols, laboratory-level rotating disk electrode (RDE) measurements, application-level membrane electrode assembly (MEA) service test), advanced interpretation techniques (spectroscopy, electron microscopy, and in situ monitoring), and cutting-edge simulation/calculations and artificial intelligence (simulation, calculations, machine learning, big data screening). This Account calls for the comprehensive development of multiscale, multicomponent, and high-entropy Pt-based alloy nanostructures, and novel and stable carriers, which provide more available options for rational design of low-cost and high-performance Pt-integrated ORR catalysts. More importantly, it will give an in-depth understanding of the reaction mechanism, dynamic development, and structure-performance relationship for Pt-based catalysts in fuel cells and related energy technologies.									89	5	0	0	4	0	90			0001-4842	1520-4898		WOS:000612345900007	33411505

In this work, the chloropropyl-modified NaY zeolite (NaY-CPT) was first synthesized in an extremely dense system through introducing 3-chloropropyl-trimethoxysilane (CPT) in the aluminosilicate sol. Then the Cu/Y-CPT catalyst was fabricated by impregnating Cu species on the NaY-CPT zeolite and the highly effective Cu/Y based catalyst has been achieved for catalytic toluene oxidation. The structure evolution of CPT modified sol and its effect on texture properties of NaY-CPT and thereby reduction ability of Cu/Y catalyst were systematically investigated by synchrotron radiation small angle X-ray scattering (SR-SAXS), EXAFS and other characterization. The CPT modified sol can promote the formation of more active aluminosilicate species, greatly accelerating crystal growth and improving framework Si/Al ratio of NaY zeolite. Due to the presence of the CPT group, the Cu/Y-CPT catalyst enhanced the interaction between Cu species and the zeolite matrix, resulting in small sized CuO nanoparticles (2.0-4.0 nm) anchoring to NaY-CPT. The Cu/Y-CPT catalyst renders more isolated Cu2+ species and adsorbed oxygen species, which are reactive in the oxidation reaction due to their high reducibility and mobility. Finally, the Cu/Y-CPT catalyst exhibits 90% toluene conversion at 296 degrees C (T-90), lower than the value of 375 degrees C on the conventional Cu/Y-con catalyst. Meanwhile, the optimal Cu/Y-CPT catalyst also gives higher toluene conversion and stability in moisture conditions.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1				2046-2069		WOS:000721008000001	35496414

Such organisms, provisionally termed UCYN-A, of the oceanic picoplanktion are major contributors to the global marine N-input by N-2-fixation. Since their photosystem II is inactive, they can perform N-2-fixation during the day. UCYN-A organisms cannot be cultivated as yet. Their genomic analysis indicates that they lack genes coding for enzymes of the Calvin cycle, the tricarboxylic acid cycle and for the biosynthesis of several amino acids. The carbon source in the ocean that allows them to thrive in such high abundance has not been identified. Their genomic analysis implies that they metabolize organic carbon by a new mode of life. These unicellular N-2-fixing cyanobacteria of the oceanic picoplankton are evolutionarily related to spheroid bodies present in diatoms of the family Epithemiaceae, such as Rhopalodia gibba. More recently, spheroid bodies were ultimately proven to be related to cyanobacteria and to express nitrogenase. They have been reported to be completely inactive in all photosynthetic reactions despite the presence of thylakoids.

Since nitrogen can be produced both in massive and intermediate-mass stars with metallicity-dependent yields, its evolution is challenging to model, as evidenced by the differences between theoretical predictions and observations. In this work, we attempt to identify the sources of these discrepancies using a cosmic evolution model. To further complicate matters, there is considerable dispersion in the abundances from observations of damped Ly alpha absorbers (DLAs) at z similar to 2-3. We study the evolution of nitrogen with a detailed cosmic chemical evolution model and find good agreement with these observations, including the relative abundances of (N/O) and (N/Si). We find that the principal contribution of nitrogen comes from intermediate-mass stars, with the exception of systems with the lowest N/H, where nitrogen production might possibly be dominated by massive stars. This last result could be strengthened if stellar rotation which is important at low metallicity can produce significant amounts of nitrogen. Moreover, these systems likely reside in host galaxies with stellar masses below 10(8.5) M-circle dot. We also study the origin of the observed dispersion in nitrogen abundances using the cosmological hydrodynamical simulations Horizon-AGN. We conclude that this dispersion can originate from two effects: difference in the masses of the DLA host galaxies, and difference in their position inside the galaxy.									10	0	0	0	0	0	10			0035-8711	1365-2966		WOS:000432660300004

Photoelectrochemical (PEC) conversion is one of the key technologies to fulfill the energy demand by converting solar energy into chemical fuels. Binary copper oxides suffer from severe photocorrosion and ternary copper oxides such as copper bismuth oxide (CuBi2O4) exhibit poor charge separation and transfer. In this work, a composite consisting of CuO annealed at 450 degrees C and CBO electrodeposited for 5 min on top of it (CuO-450/CBO-5) showed the best performance with a positive shift of 0.2 V in onset potential, a high current density of -0.9 mA cm(-2) at 0.1 V vs RHE and high stability over pure CuO. The systematic deposition of CBO on CuO leads to intimate contact between the two semiconductors wherein, CuO acts as a hole carrier and CBO accommodates the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER).

In recent years, the Co@C composites have exhibited effective HER catalytic performance in acidic media. However, the catalytic performance of Co@C in alkaline media is still unsatisfactory because of the sluggish water dissociation in Volmer step. In this work, by using carbon encapsulated metal Co nanoparticles hybrid structure (CoNP@C) as precatalyst, we firstly demonstrate that the HER activity of Co-based precatalysts could be unprecedentedly promoted through a simple in situ electrochemical activation process. Compared with initial CoNPs@C precatalyst, the activated catalyst realizes about 3.5-fold improved activity and the overpotential greatly decreases from 191 mV to 58 mV at 10 mA cm(-2). Specially, the remarkable reduced Tafel slope (from 113 mV dec(-1) to 51 mV dec(-1)) indicates that the sluggish kinetics of the water dissociation step (Volmer step) is effectively speeded up by in situ electrochemical activation. Such a highly enhanced catalytic performance is mainly due to the in situ introduction of cobalt hydroxides NPs as water dissociation promoter and the synergetic effects among core Co NPs, middle layered carbon structure and outer cobalt hydroxides NPs. Our study offers a generic strategy for development of high-performance 3d-transition metal hybrid based HER catalysts in alkaline media.									41	1	0	0	1	0	41			2211-2855	2211-3282		WOS:000434829500003

This study investigated the feasibility of applying low-dissolved oxygen (low-DO) nitrification and utilizing slowly-biodegradable chemical oxygen demand (sbCOD) for denitrification, which helps to reduce energy usage and operating cost in treating low soluble COD-to-nitrogen tropical wastewater. The tropical wastewater was first characterized using wastewater fractionation and respirometly batch tests. Then, a lab-scale sequencing batch reactor (SBR) was operated to evaluate the long-term stability of low-DO nitrification and utilizing sbCOD for denitrification in an anoxic-oxic (AO) process treating tropical wastewater. The wastewater fractionation experiment revealed that particulate settleable solids (PSS) in the wastewater provided slowly-biodegradable COD (sbCOD), which made up the major part (51 +/- 10%) of the total COD. The PSS hydrolysis rate constant at tropical temperature (30 degrees C) was 2.5 times higher than that at 20 degrees C, suggesting that sbCOD may be utilized for denitrification. During the SBR operation, high nitrification efficiency (93 +/- 6%) was attained at low-DO condition (0.9 +/- 0.1 mg O-2/L). Utilizing sbCOD for post-anoxic denitrification in the SBR reduced the effluent nitrate concentration. Quantitative polymerase chain reaction, 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing and fluorescence in-situ hybridization revealed that the genus Nitrospira was a dominant nitrifier. 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing result suggested that 50% of the Nitrospira-related operational taxonomic units were affiliated with comammox, which may imply condition and the warm wastewater promoted their growth. The nitrogen removal in a tropical AO process was enhanced by incorporating low-DO nitrification and utilizing sbCOD for post-anoxic denitrification, which contributes to an improved energy sustainability of WWTPs.

Scanning from 0.6-1.0 V (vs. RHE) for 10 000 cycles gives Au98.2Pt1.8, which serves as an excellent catalyst for the formic acid oxidation reaction, showing 41 times higher specific activity (20.19 mA cm(-2)) and 25 times higher mass activity (10.80 A mg(Pt)(-1)) with much better CO-tolerance and stability than commercial Pt.

Atomic force microscopy (AFM) was used to study topographic characteristics of the films, including nucleation, crystalline feature, grain size, clustering and roughening. The initial nucleation of titanium oxides has almost completed during annealing at 300 degrees C for 120min or 400 degrees C for 30min. Especially, we have already observed the preferential nucleation and grain growth of titanium oxides on locations that protrude from the surface, as opposed to deep grooves. It is confirmed by AFM characterization that both of annealing temperature and time can hasten the nucleation and grain growth of titanium oxides, but annealing time is less influential than its temperature. The typical crystal transfer from amorphous-like to crystalline state occurs at 300-400 degrees C for 120 min during annealing, but the too low temperature of 200 degrees C does not contribute to the crystal transfer. In addition, higher annealing temperature (600 degrees C) leads to the transformation of crystal texture from globular-like to flaky type. Generally, higher annealing temperature or time can lead to higher film surface roughness through the grooving effect, but the roughness decreases with the increase of annealing time (at 400 degrees C for 90-120min).									4	1	1	0	0	0	6			0218-625X	1793-6667		WOS:000294564900009

Herein, a kind of cobalt phosphate, i.e., Co-3(OH)(2)(HPO4)(2) (Co-3(PO4)(2)center dot 2H(2)O), was prepared by a simple hydrothermal method, and was proved to be a novel, stable photocatalyst for O-2 evolution under visible-light irradiation for the first time. The photocatalytic mechanism of Co-3(OH)(2)(HPO4)(2) was revealed by comprehensively comparing the physicochemical properties of Co-3(OH)(2)(HPO4)(2) with those of another kind of cobalt phosphate, i.e., Co-3(PO4)2 center dot 8H(2)O, which was prepared by a precipitation method and showed little photocatalytic activity for O-2 evolution under visible-light irradiation. The significantly improved photocatalytic activity of Co-3(OH)(2)(HPO4)(2), compared with that of Co-3(PO4)(2)center dot 8H(2)O, was mainly attributed to the synergistic promotion of the photocatalytic process by the following physicochemical properties of Co-3(OH)(2)(HPO4)(2), i.e., the distortion of Co2+ octahedra, the difference in electronic properties and the linkage of oxo bridges between the adjacent Co(1) and Co(2) octahedra. This work extended the application of cobalt phosphate in photocatalysis and presented an effective route to explore new O-2-evolution photo-catalysts by modifying the appropriate materials that were commonly employed as cocatalysts.									22	1	0	0	0	0	23			2044-4753	2044-4761		WOS:000388494100016

Oxidation kinetics analysis, based on the shrinking core model, was also performed to reveal the quantitative effect of Fe on the oxidation resistance. Compared to the traditional MgO-C refractory, both densification and bonding degree of Fe-containing refractory after high-temperature oxidation were greatly improved by the formation of Mg (Fe1.2Al0.8)O-4 bridges and magnesio-wustite [(Mg,Fe)O-ss]. This change of microstructure caused a dramatic decrease in the effective diffusion coefficient of oxygen (D-eff, decreased from 18.3 to 5.0 cm(2)/min), which contributed the most to the improvement of the oxidation resistance. The maintenance of strength against oxidation time was another important finding for the newly designed refractory, providing a basis for developing new carbon-containing refractories with self-repairing function.									12	1	0	0	0	0	13			0254-0584	1879-3312		WOS:000490046000046

Herein, we propose a dual-metallic NiCoP@NiFeP homologous heterojunction array, in which the homologous elements and similar crystal structure will ensure close coupling to improve the accessibility of active interfaces. Meanwhile, the 3D array morphology contributes to the hydrophobic gas surface for guaranteeing the escape of H-2 bubbles at high current density. Benefiting from the harmonic interface charge and mass transport, our constructed electrocatalysts surpass the RuO2||Pt/C water splitting activity at 1000 mA cm(-2) @ similar to 1.93 V over 100 hours in a real alkaline exchange membrane electrolyzer. Overall, we demonstrate that the multiscale regulation advances the understanding of complex relationships between the atomic interface, catalyst-electrolyte interface, and function in various electrocatalytic processes.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000781893700001

However, the selective reduction of CO2 in aqueous electrolytes has been challenging owing to a competing hydrogen evolution reaction occurring in aqueous electrolytes. In this study, single atom nickel and nitrogen doped three-dimensional porous carbon catalysts are developed for the selective production of carbon monoxide (CO) from CO2. The catalysts exhibit high CO selectivity with over 99% faradaic efficiency at -0.8 V vs. the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE), and achieve a high current density of over 50 mA cm(-2) at -1.0 V vs. RHE in a bicarbonate electrolyte. To further improve the CO2 reduction rate, the accessibility of CO2 to the catalysts was enhanced by directly supplying gaseous CO2 to the surface of the catalysts. The catalysts were deposited between a gas diffusion layer and an ion exchange membrane to form a membrane electrode assembly (MEA). Benefiting from the high concentration of CO2 over the catalyst surfaces and the three-dimensional structure of the catalysts, a high CO production rate exceeding 300 mA cm(-2) with 99% faradaic efficiency can be achieved.									95	3	0	0	5	0	95			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000472183200053

They are occurring as secreted, glycosylated proteins bearing a haem-thiolate active site and rely on hydrogen peroxide as the oxygen source. However, their heterologous production in a fast-growing organism suitable for high throughput screening has only succeeded once-enabled by an intensive directed evolution campaign. We developed and applied a modular Golden Gate-based secretion system, allowing the first production of four active UPOs in yeast, their one-step purification and application in an enantioselective conversion on a preparative scale. The Golden Gate setup was designed to be universally applicable and consists of the three module types: i) signal peptides for secretion, ii) UPO genes, and iii) protein tags for purification and split-GFP detection. The modular episomal system is suitable for use in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and was transferred to episomal and chromosomally integrated expression cassettes in Pichia pastoris. Shake flask productions in Pichia pastoris yielded up to 24mg/L secreted UPO enzyme, which was employed for the preparative scale conversion of a phenethylamine derivative reaching 98.6 % ee. Our results demonstrate a rapid, modular yeast secretion workflow of UPOs yielding preparative scale enantioselective biotransformations. Pullmann et al developed a modular Golden Gate-based secretion system, which enabled production and one-step purification of active fungal unspecific peroxygenases (UPOs) in yeast. Their system was applied to an enantioselective conversion on a preparative scale and may be used in the future for other genes of interest that are suitable for production in yeast.									17	0	0	0	12	0	17				2399-3642		WOS:000656275200003	33980981

The results show that higher temperature leads to larger grain size, improved crystallinity, and better crystal orientation for the BiVO4 thin film electrodes. Under air-mass 1.5 global (AM 1.5) solar light illumination, the BiVO4 thin film prepared at a higher annealing temperature (500-540 degrees C) shows better PEC OER performance. Also, the OER photocurrent density increased from 0.25 mA cm(-2) to 1.27 mA cm(-2) and that of the oxidation of sulfite, a hole scavenger, increased from 1.39 to 2.53 mA cm(-2) for the samples prepared from 400 degrees C to 540 degrees C. Open-circuit photovoltage decay (OCPVD) measurement indicates that BiVO4 samples prepared at the higher annealing temperature have less charge recombination and longer electron lifetime. However, the BiVO4 samples prepared at lower annealing temperature have better EC performance in the absence of light illumination and more electrochemically active surface sites, which are negatively related to electrochemical double-layer capacitance (C-dl). C-dl was 0.0074 mF cm(-2) at 400 degrees C and it decreased to 0.0006 mF cm(-2) at 540 degrees C. The OER and sulfide oxidation are carefully compared and these show that the efficiency of charge transport in the bulk ((bulk)) and on the surface ((surface)) of the BiVO4 thin film electrode are improved with the increase in the annealing temperature. The mechanism behind the light-condition-dependent role of the annealing treatment is also discussed.									17	0	0	0	3	0	17			2046-2069			WOS:000444700100038	35548013

Three distinct catalytic regimes are identified during CO2 hydrogenation: activation, stable performance, and deactivation. The structural evolution of In2O3 nanoparticles (NPs) with time on stream (TOS) followed by XANES-EXAFS-XRD associates the activation stage with a minor decrease of the In-O coordination number and a partial reduction of In2O3 due to the formation of oxygen vacancy sites (i.e., In2O3-x). As the reaction proceeds, a reductive amorphization of In2O3 NPs takes place, characterized by decreasing In-O and In-In coordination numbers and intensities of the In2O3 Bragg peaks. A multivariate analysis of the XANES data confirms the formation of In2O3-x and, with TOS, metallic In. Notably, the appearance of molten In-0 coincides with the onset of catalyst deactivation. This phase transition is also visualized by in situ TEM, acquired under reactive conditions at 800 mbar pressure. In situ TEM revealed an electron beam assisted transformation of In2O3 nanoparticles into a dynamic structure in which crystalline and amorphous phases coexist and continuously interconvert. The regeneration of the deactivated In-0/In2O3-x catalyst by reoxidation was critically assessed revealing that the spent catalyst can be reoxidized only partially in a CO2 atmosphere or air yielding an average crystallite size of the resultant In2O3 that is approximately an order of magnitude larger than the initial one.									124	10	0	0	10	0	126			0002-7863	1520-5126		WOS:000484082700029	31322870

Ag cocatalyst-loaded BaLa4Ti4O15 was the most active photocatalyst. A liquid-phase chemical reduction method was better than impregnation and in situ photodeposition methods for the loading of the Ag cocatalyst. The Ag cocatalyst prepared by the liquid-phase chemical reduction method was loaded as fine particles with the size smaller than 10 nm on the edge of the BaLa4Ti4O15 photocatalyst powder with a plate shape during the CO2 reduction. CO was the main reduction product rather than H-2 even in an aqueous medium on the optimized Ag/BaLa4Ti4O15 photocatalyst. Evolution of O-2 in a stoichiometric ratio (H-2+CO: O-2 = 2:1 in a molar ratio) indicated that water was consumed as a reducing reagent (an electron donor) for the CO2 reduction. Thus, an uphill reaction of CO2 reduction accompanied with water oxidation was achieved using the Ag/BaLa4Ti4O15 photocatalyst.									437	16	0	0	35	0	440			0002-7863	1520-5126		WOS:000298571600038	22087856

The identification of the crystal structures indicates that the (ZrO2)(x)-(Dy3TaO7)(1-x) ceramics belong to the orthorhombic system, and the space group is C222(1) in spite of the value of x increasing to 0.1. The thermal conductivities of the (ZrO2)(x)-(Dy3TaO7)(1-x) ceramics range from 1.3 W/(m K) to 1.8 W/(m K), and this value is much lower than that of 7-8 YSZ (yttria-stabilized zirconia). Besides, the (ZrO2)(x)-(Dy3TaO7)(1-x) ceramics possess the glass-like thermal conductivity caused by intrinsic oxygen vacancies existing in the lattice of Dy3TaO7. Moreover, the results of thermal expansion rates demonstrate that the (ZrO2)(x)-(Dy3TaO7)(1-x) ceramics possess excellent high temperature phase stability, and the thermal expansion coefficients [(9.7-11) x 10(-6) K-1] are comparable to that of 7-8 YSZ.

In this work, the catalytic HER activity of a class of two-dimensional (2D) metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), i.e., M-3(C6O3S3)(2) with M = Sc, Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn, Zr, Nb, Mo, Tc, Ru, Ta, W, and Re, is studied by using first-principles calculations. It is found that nonmetal atoms of the first coordination sphere to the central metal atom could be the active site for HER, and V-3(C6O3S3)(2) (delta G(H*) = 0.02 eV, on V), Cr-3(C6O3S3)(2) (delta G(H*) = -0.02 eV, on S, and delta G(H*) = -0.05 eV, on O), and Cu-3(C6O3S3)(2) (delta G(H*) = -0.03 eV, on S) are screened out as promising HER catalysts. To complete the picture of how the metal-ligand matching affects the activity, a different coordination microenvironment is considered by regulating the first coordination shell to, for example, the central V atom. It is of interest that the newly constructed moieties present high catalytic HER activity with delta G(H*) almost zero, proving the significance of metal-ligand interaction. In view of these results, we propose a descriptor delta epsilon(up arrow down arrow) that correlates the local electronic structure and the catalytic HER activity. In short, our results not only identify a series of efficient HER electrocatalysts but also unravel the underneath factors that affect the activity and thus provide new insights into the rational design of catalysts for other reactions.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1932-7447	1932-7455		WOS:000861499600001

However, pristine TiO2 possesses a large band gap (3.2 eV), fast recombination of electrons and holes, and low selectivity for the photoreduction of CO2. Recently, considerable progress has been made in the improvement of the performance of TiO2 photocatalysts for CO2 reduction. In this review, we first discuss the fundamentals of and challenges in CO2 photoreduction on TiO2-based catalysts. Next, the recently emerging progress and advances in TiO2 nanostructured and hybrid materials for overcoming the mentioned obstacles to achieve high light-harvesting capability, improved adsorption and activation of CO2, excellent photocatalytic activity, the ability to impede the recombination of electrons-holes pairs, and efficient suppression of hydrogen evolution are discussed. In addition, approaches and strategies for improvements in TiO2-based photocatalysts and their working mechanisms are thoroughly summarized and analyzed. Lastly, the current challenges and prospects of CO2 photocatalytic reactions on TiO2-based catalysts are also presented.									59	0	0	0	7	0	59				2079-4991		WOS:000522456300156	32079215

Herein, three-dimensional (3D) hierarchical zigzag-branched urchin-like PdCuPt superstructures (HZBUS) were prepared by a one-pot wet-chemical method, where polyethylene oxide (PEO) and KBr served as directing agents. The specific architectures provided abundant active sites highly available for reactants, in turn showing highly enlarged electrochemically active surface area (16.79 m(2)g(Pd)(-1)). The as-obtained PdCuPt HZBUS displayed dramatically enhanced catalytic activity and improved long-term durability for formic acid oxidation reaction (FAOR), surpassing homemade PdCu nanoparticles (NPs), commercial Pd black and PVC catalysts. This work offers a new strategy for construction of advanced multimetallic electrocatalysts with charming superstructures and high-efficient performances in fuel cells.									16	1	0	0	0	0	16			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000514902000084

The physicochemical and electrochemical properties of the electrodes were analyzed by spectral methods and electrochemical measurements. The Ti/SnO2-Sb-TiN electrode has a compact, crack-free film and possesses a smaller unit cell volume than Ti/SnO2-Sb electrode. TiN nanoparticles were evenly distributed in the electrode surface, and the adsorbed oxygen content was increased by doping TiN into Ti/SnO2-Sb electrode. Electrochemical tests showed that the TiN-modified electrode has higher electrochemical activity and longer service lifetime, which were helpful to the electrochemical decolorization Orange II solution. The results also confirmed that Ti/SnO2-Sb-TiN electrode has higher decolorization efficiency and kinetic rate constant, which are 2.27 and 8.7 times as efficient as those of Ti/Sb-SnO2, respectively.

These Co-NCMS were highly active and durable non-noble metal catalysts for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). This hybrid electrocatalyst showed high ORR activity with a diffusion-limiting current of 5.237 mA.cm(-2) in 0.1 M KOH solution through the highly efficient 4e(-) pathway, which was superior to that of the Pt/C catalyst (4.99 mA.cm(-2)), and the ORR Tafel slope is ca. 67.7 mV.dec(-1) at a high potential region, close to that of Pt/C. Furthermore, Co-NCMS exhibited good ORR activity in acidic media with an onset potential comparable to that of the Pt/C catalyst. Most importantly, the prepared catalyst showed much higher stability and better methanol tolerance in both alkaline and acidic solutions. The power density obtained in a proton exchange membrane fuel cell was as high as 0.37 W.cm(-2) at 0.19 V compared with 0.45 W.cm(-2) at 0.56 V for the Pt/C catalyst. In Co-NCMS, the Ndoped carbon nanocages facilitated the diffusion of the reactant, maximizing the exposure of active sites on the surface and protecting the active metallic core from oxidation. This made Co-NCMS one of the best non-noble metal catalysts and potentially offers an alternative approach for the efficient utilization of active transition metals in electrocatalyst applications.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2470-1343			WOS:000685204100004	34395965	
J	Simpson, BK; Johnson, DC					Simpson, Brett/0000-0001-7632-0500			Enhancement of anodic response for DMSO at ruthenium oxide film electrodes as a result of doping with iron(III)								ELECTROANALYSIS				15	2			97	102		10.1002/elan.200390018				FEB 2003	2003	The oxidation of dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) to dimethyl sulfone (DMSO2) is representative of numerous anodic oxygen-transfer reactions of organosulfur compounds that suffer from slow kinetics at noble metal electrodes. Anodic voltammetric data for DMSO are examined at various RuO2-film electrodes prepared by thermal deposition on titanium substrates. The response for DMSO is slightly larger at RuO2 films prepared in a flame as compared with films prepared in a furnace; however, temperature is more easily controlled in the furnace. Doping of the RuO2 films with Fe(III) further improves the sensitivity of anodic response for DMSO. Optimal response is obtained at an Fe(III)-doped RuO2-film electrode prepared using a deposition solution of 50 mM RuCl3 and 10 mM FeCl3 in a 1:1 mixture of isopropanol and 12 M HCl at an annealing temperature of 450degreesC. The Levich plot (i vs. omega(1/2)) and Koutecky-Levich plot (1/i vs. 1/omega(1/2)) of amperometric data for the oxidation of DMSO at an Fe(Ill)-doped RuO2-film electrode configured as a rotated disk are consistent with an anodic response controlled by mass-transport processes at low rotational velocities. Flow injection data demonstrate that Fe(III)-doped RuO2-film electrodes exhibit detection capability for methionine and cysteine in addition to DMSO. Detection limits for 100-muL injections of the three compounds are ca. 3.2 x 10(-4) mM, i.e., ca. 32 pmol.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1040-0397			WOS:000181173800002

At present, the blueprint of hydrogen energy economy in the world is gradually taking shape. Compared with the traditional high-energy consuming methane steam reforming hydrogen production method, the electrocatalytic water splitting hydrogen production stands out among other process of hydrogen production owning to the mild reaction conditions, high-purity hydrogen generation and sustainable production process. Basing on current technical economy situation, the highly electric power cost limits the further promotion of electrocatalytic water splitting hydrogen production process. Consequently, the rational design and development of low overpotential and high stability electrocatalytic water splitting catalysts are critical toward the realization of low-cost hydrogen production technology. In this review, we summarize the existing hydrogen production methods, elaborate the reaction mechanism of the electrocatalytic water splitting reaction under acidic and alkaline conditions and the recent progress of the respective catalysts for the two half-reactions. The structure-activity relationship of the catalyst was deep-going discussed, together with the prospects of electrocatalytic water splitting and the current challenges, aiming at provide insights for electrocatalytic water splitting catalyst development and its industrial applications.

Electro-catalytic N-2 reduction to NH3 formation by renewable resources is one of the effective ways to settle the issue. However, the electro-catalytic performances and selectivity of catalysts for electrochemical nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR) are very low. Therefore, it is of great significance to develop more efficient electro-catalysts to satisfy the needs of practical use. Among the reported catalysts, those based on Group VIII noble metals heterogeneous catalysts display excellent NRR activities and high selectivity because of their good conductivity, rich active surface area, unfilled d-orbitals, and the abilities with easy adsorption of reactants and stable reaction intermediates. Herein, we will introduce the progress of Group VIII precious metals heterogeneous catalysts applied in the electrocatalytic N-2 reduction reaction. Then single precious metal electrocatalysts, precious metal alloy electrocatalysts, heterojunction structure electrocatalysts, and precious metal compounds based on the strategies of morphology engineering, crystal facet engineering, defect engineering, heteroatom doping, and synergetic interface engineering will be discussed. Finally, the challenges and prospects of the NH3 synthesis have been put forward. In the review, we will provide helpful direction to the development of effective electro-catalysts for catalytic N-2 reduction reaction.									14	1	0	0	3	0	14			1861-4728	1861-471X		WOS:000591920200001	33025764

Although much research has focused on the enzyme's central role in the mitochondrial respiratory chain, comparatively little is known about its role in the diverse energetic lifestyles of different bacteria. Here, we used a phylogenomic approach to better understand the distribution of complex I across bacteria, the evolution of this enzyme, and its potential roles in shaping the physiology of different bacterial groups. By surveying 970 representative bacterial genomes, we predict complex I to be present in similar to 50% of bacteria. While this includes bacteria with a wide range of energetic schemes, the presence of complex I is associated with specific lifestyles, including aerobic respiration and specific types of phototrophy (bacteria with only a type II reaction center). A phylogeny of bacterial complex I revealed five main clades of enzymes whose evolution is largely congruent with the evolution of the bacterial groups that encode complex I. A notable exception includes the gammaproteobacteria, whose members encode one of two distantly related complex I enzymes predicted to participate in different types of respiratory chains (aerobic versus anaerobic). Comparative genomic analyses suggest a broad role for complex I in reoxidizing NADH produced from various catabolic reactions, including the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle and fatty acid beta-oxidation. Together, these findings suggest diverse roles for complex I across bacteria and highlight the importance of this enzyme in shaping diverse physiologies across the bacterial domain.IMPORTANCE Living systems use conserved energy currencies, including a proton motive force (PMF), NADH, and ATP. The respiratory chain enzyme, complex I, connects these energy currencies by using NADH produced during nutrient breakdown to generate a PMF, which is subsequently used for ATP synthesis. Our goal is to better understand the role of complex I in bacteria, whose energetic diversity allows us to view its function in a range of biological contexts. We analyzed sequenced bacterial genomes to predict the presence, evolution, and function of complex I in bacteria. We identified five main classes of bacterial complex I and predict that different classes participate in different types of respiratory chains (aerobic and anaerobic). We also predict that complex I helps maintain a cellular redox state by reoxidizing NADH produced from central metabolism. Our findings suggest diverse roles for complex I in bacterial physiology, highlighting the need for future laboratory-based studies.									34	1	0	0	32	0	35			2150-7511			WOS:000355312400088	25873378

State-of-the-art high-resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy coupled with electron energy loss spectroscopy resolved at the nanoscale is exploited. It is directly highlighted by electron spectromicroscopy that, above 0.1 V versus Li, the electrochemical activity of Si electrodes involves a complex interplay between Li incorporation, electrolyte degradation, and Si reduction/oxidation. These redox processes occur upon cycling through partially reversible reactions mediated by the solid electrolyte interphase. Overall, a SiO2 amorphous layer forms in the oxidized electrodes at the Si NPs interface with the electrolyte: this oxide shell partially dissolves upon reduction to give Li2CO3 and amorphous Si. Si NPs cores are therefore eroded upon cycling as their outer layers are directly involved in a reversible oxygen shifting mechanism at the interface, whereas unreacted SiO2 accumulates cycle-by-cycle. These findings extend the comprehension of the Si pulverization mechanism in Li batteries.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2194-4288	2194-4296		WOS:000728680300001

We herein report the construction of a self-supported air cathode for Zn-air batteries made of S,N-codoped porous complex carbon nanostructures of Co/Co-Cu-S/carbon nanoplate arrays and carbon nanofibers (denoted as Co/Co-Cu-S@SNPCP-CFs).

The Co/Co-Cu-S@SNPCP-CFs catalyst reveals a small potential gap (Delta E=0.67 V) between the half-wave potential of ORR and OER potential at 10 mA cm(-2), demonstrating outstanding bifunctional performance. Furthermore, the rechargeable Zn-air battery made with the as-obtained electrocatalyst exhibits a high-power density of 220 mW cm(-2) and a long cycling time of over 800 h at 10 mA cm(-2), and the flexible solid state rechargeable Zn-air battery based on Co/Co-Cu-S@SNPCP-CFs self-supporting air cathode also displays a long duration time of over 60 h.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			1674-7321	1869-1900		WOS:000739293000001

Here, operando X-ray diffraction with high-brilliant X-rays in a transmission mode was used to observe the intensity and structural changes of crystalline Li2O2 in an operating non-aqueous LAB in real time, and the Li-O-2 electrochemical reaction involving Li2O2 formation and decomposition was clearly demonstrated. The electrochemically formed Li2O2, which had an anisotropic domain size of 10 nm in the c-direction and 40-70 nm in the ab-plane, grew due to the increase of the number of domains during the discharge process. No other reaction products with a crystalline phase such as LiOH were found in either the cathode or anode of the LAB, whereas the accelerated decomposition rate of the domains was accompanied with the change of the domain shape and lattice constant of the c-axis in the latter half of the charge process with voltage higher than 4 V.									7	0	0	0	1	0	7				2046-2069		WOS:000441685100049	35541926

Graphene, as a one-atom-thick two-dimensional carbon material with unique structural and electronic properties, has been reported to be a superb support for SACs. Herein, we provide an overview of recent progress in investigations of graphene-based SACs. Among the large number of publications, we will selectively focus on the stability of metal single-atoms (SAs) anchored on different sites of graphene support and the catalytic performances of graphene-based SACs for different chemical reactions, including thermocatalysis and electrocatalysis. We will summarize the fundamental understandings on the electronic structures and their intrinsic connection with catalytic properties of graphene-based SACs, and also provide a brief perspective on the future design of efficient SACs with graphene and graphene-like materials.									144	9	0	0	6	0	144			0009-2665	1520-6890		WOS:000588271100011	33112608

Carbon-supported nanoparticles								ELECTROCHIMICA ACTA				54	26			6130	6139		10.1016/j.electacta.2009.04.074				NOV 1 2009	2009	We studied the borohydride oxidation reaction (BOR) by voltammetry in 0.1 M NaOH/10(-3) M BH(4)(-) on carbon-supported Pt, Ag and alloyed PtAg nanoparticles (here-after denoted as Pt/C, Ag/C and Pt-Ag/C). In order to compare the different electrocatalysts, we measured the BOR kinetic parameters and the number of electrons exchanged per BH(4)(-) anion (faradaic efficiency). The BOR kinetics is much faster for Pt/C than for Ag/C (i(pt) = 0.15, i(Ag) = 3.1 x 10(-4) A cm(-2) at E = -0.65 V vs. NHE at 25 degrees C), but both materials present similar Tafel slope values. The n value involved in the BOR depends on the thickness of the active layer of electrocatalysts. For a "thick layer" (approximately 3 mu m), n is nearly 8 on Pt/C and similar to 4 on Ag/C, whereas n decreases for thinner Pt/C active layers (n similar to 2 for thickness < 1 mu m). These results are in favour of the sequential BH(4)(-) hydrolysis (yielding H(2)) followed by hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR), or direct sequential BOR on Pt/C, whereas Ag/C promotes direct but incomplete BOR (Ag has no activity regarding hydrogen evolution reaction, HER). The n value close to 8 for the thick Pt/C layer displays the sufficient residence time of the molecules formed (H(2) by heterogeneous hydrolysis or BOR intermediates) within the active layer, which favours the complete HOR and/or BOR. Two PtAg/C nanoparticles alloys have been tested (noted APVES-4C and APVES-E1). They show different behavior: the borohydride oxidation reaction kinetics is faster on APVES-E1 than on APVES-4C (b = 0.15, i(-0.65V) = 0.09 and b = 0.31 V dec(-1), i(-0.65V) = 6.3 x 10(-3) A cm(-2), respectively, at 25 degrees C), but the n values are higher on APVES-4C than APVES-E1 (nearly 8 vs. 3, respectively. at 25 degrees C). These discrepancies probably originate from the heterogeneity of such bimetallic materials, as observed from physicochemical characterizations. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Elemental sulfur was shown to be the final product under various temperatures, potentials and times of electrolysis, in amounts that increased with increase in the above variables. The rate of the process is controlled by electron transfer across the interface, while diffusion in the electrolyte has only a modest effect. The apparent reaction orders with respect to the sulfide concentration and pH are 0.60 and 0, respectively. The proposed overall reaction is: HS(aq)- -> HSads + e. The charge transfer coefficient is alpha(a) and the standard rate constant atthe equilibrium potential is k degrees = 2.2 x 10(-7) cm s(-1). The degree of coverage of the electrode with sulfur and the polarization resistance of the interface increase, while the current decreases, with the time of electrolysis as more sulfur is deposited on the electrode surface.									24	1	0	0	8	0	25			0021-891X	1572-8838		WOS:000244092700013

Photochemical water oxidation activity was evaluated under visible light irradiation (480 < lambda < 500 nm) in the presence of tri(2,2'-bipyridyl) ruthenium(II) sulfate and sodium persulfate, which served as a redox photosensitizer and a sacrificial electron acceptor, respectively. Electrochemical water oxidation was conducted in a phosphate buffered aqueous solution (pH 7.5) using Fe2-xCrxO3 particles, which were loaded on a transparent conductive glass support, in the presence of an electrochemical bias. While hematite (alpha-Fe2O3) is known to be a catalytic material for water oxidation, its catalytic activity dropped upon substitution of Cr(III) ions for Fe(III) sites in Fe2O3 at least in part due to oxidative dissolution of Cr(III) on the oxide surface, which competed with water oxidation during the reaction. On the other hand, Cr-substitution resulted in a five-fold enhancement in the activity for electrochemical water oxidation to form oxygen. Electrochemical impedance measurements revealed that the Cr-substitution decreased the resistance of charge transfer inside the Fe2O3 bulk, thereby leading to improved performance for electrochemical water oxidation.									14	0	0	0	0	0	14			2044-4753	2044-4761		WOS:000405806900004

To fill this gap, density functional theory and molecular dynamics simulations are performed to capture the initial stage of the oxidation process of Ti2C, a prototypical example from the recently fabricated class of two-dimensional carbides and carbonitrides. It is shown that the unsaturated Ti 3d orbitals of the pristine Ti2C surface interact strongly with the approaching O-2 molecules, resulting in barrierless O-2 dissociation. The diffusion of the dissociated O atoms is also found to be very facile. Molecular dynamics simulations suggest that both dissociation and diffusion are enhanced as the O-2 coverage increases to 0.25 monolayer. For a coverage of less than 0.11 monolayer, the adsorbates lead to a minor modification of the electronic properties of Ti2C, while the modification is remarkable at 0.25 monolayer. The formed Ti2CO2 after O saturation is an indirect narrow gap semiconductor (0.33 eV) with high intrinsic carrier concentration at room temperature and high thermodynamic stability at intermediate temperature (e.g., 550 degrees C).									67	6	0	0	4	0	71			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000325991700039

The mechanism of hole broadening is analyzed by fluctuation of the local dipolar field at the site of Y-D(+) caused by a random spin flip of these transition metal ions. Experimental data was analyzed using a simple theory (Dzuba, S.A., Kodera, Y., Hara, H. and Kawamori, A. (1993) J. Magn. Res. A 102, 257-260). Based on this theory, the distance from Y-D(+) to Fe2+ ion has been determined to be less than 52 Angstrom in Mn-depleted PS II. The distance from Y-D(+) to the spin center of the Mn-cluster in OEC was estimated to be 28 Angstrom in S-2 state and 30 Angstrom in S-1 state. Furthermore, the distribution of the distance was estimated to be in the range 4-6 Angstrom.									23	0	0	0	13	0	24			0005-2728			WOS:A1994NW57700012

Radiation is accounted for through the RADCAL method and the inclusion of enthalpy into the joint-scalar PDF. Molecular mixing is closed using the modified Curl's model with the mixing frequency accounted for via two algebraic closures. The main aim of the work is to compare the impact of alternative chemical mechanisms on auto-ignition and to explore the accuracy that can be expected when reactive scalars are sequentially removed through the application of quasi-steady-state approximations (QSSAs). Two different detailed mechanisms were tested to establish the effects of intrinsic uncertainties in the detailed chemistry and to provide reference points to past work. The mechanisms feature nine solved species and 19 or 20 reversible chemical reactions. The chemical mechanisms were subsequently systematically reduced to five, four and three independent scalars through the successive introduction of QSSAs for H2O2, HO2 and O. Resulting inaccuracies were quantified following each simplification step with reference to experimental data obtained in shock tubes and under turbulent flow conditions in the Cabra burner configuration. A sensitivity analysis was also performed to identify the relative impact of uncertainties in key reactions as compared to systematic simplification process. It was found that alternative recommended rates for the O + H2 = OH + H reaction have an impact on the point of flame stabilization that is similar to that observed as a consequence of the simplification process. The work also shows that realistic results can be obtained with simplified chemistry. However, it is also concluded that the temporal evolution of the radical pool and the point of stabilization is affected by the introduction of a QSSA for the O radical. Furthermore, it is shown by comparisons with time resolved OH radical data obtained in shock tubes that the progressive elimination of species via QSSA leads to a shortening of ignition delay times and that the same effects are present, but less severe, in turbulent flow fields.									17	1	0	0	0	0	17			1364-7830	1741-3559		WOS:000269793100003

As reactive oxygen species (ROS) are mutagenic, the evolution of resistance to ciprofloxacin (CIP) in biofilms under oxidative stress conditions was investigated. We experimentally evolved six replicate populations of P. aeruginosa lacking the major catalase Delta KatA in colony biofilms and stationary-phase cultures for seven passages in the presence of subinhibitory levels (0.1 mg/liter) of CIP or without CIP (eight replicate lineages for controls) under aerobic conditions. In CIP-evolved biofilms, a larger CIP-resistant subpopulation was isolated in the Delta katA strain than in the wild-type (WT) PAO1 population, suggesting oxidative stress as a promoter of the development of antibiotic resistance. A higher number of mutations identified by population sequencing were observed in evolved Delta katA biofilm populations (OP and control) than in WT PAO1 populations evolved under the same conditions. Genes involved in iron assimilation were found to be exclusively mutated in CIP-evolved AkatA biofilm populations, probably as a defense mechanism against ROS formation resulting from Fenton reactions. Furthermore, a hypermutable lineage due to mutL inactivation developed in one CIPevolved Delta katA biofilm lineage. In CIP-evolved biofilms of both the Delta katA strain and WT PAO1, mutations in nfxB, the negative regulator of the MexCD-OprJ efflux pump, were observed while in CIP-evolved planktonic cultures of both the Delta katA strain and WT PAO1, mutations in mexR and naID, regulators of the MexAB-OprM efflux pump, were repeatedly found. In conclusion, these results emphasize the role of oxidative stress as an environmental factor that might increase the development of antibiotic resistance in in vivo biofilms.									8	0	0	0	4	0	8			0066-4804	1098-6596		WOS:000487320100001	31307984

The introduction of biochar significantly improved the specific surface area (from 37.0 to 62.7 m(2)/g). The BC-Co3O4/PMS system showed an excellent performance for the degradation of antibiotics (ofloxacin, OFX in this case). The evolution of radical species was monitored with electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) technique. Both SO4 center dot- and (OH)-O-center dot contributed to the degradation process and the latter one played a major role. The radicals were mainly generated through heterogeneous mechanism rather than homogeneous process. The effects of experimental conditions (initial pH value, dose of PMS, naturally occurring inorganic anions) on the degradation process were systematically investigated. Eventually, the X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) results suggested that the large amounts of Co-OH groups on BC-Co3O4 might be the reason of the extraordinary activity. The findings obtained from this study might be meaningful to enlarge the applications of biochar.									134	4	0	0	76	0	137			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000445413900083

Herein, we have applied atomic layer deposition (ALD) to depositing nano-sized Co3O4 onto La0.5Sr0.5MnO3 (LSM). Interestingly, an in-situ Mn diffusion from LSM during ALD process gives a self-reconstructed MnCo2O4 spinel interlayer between LSM and Co3O4. The X-ray absorption fine structure (XAFS) of LSM with 20 ALD cycles of Co3O4 (LSM-20-Co) showed a partially left-shifted white line of Co K-edge compared to the that of Co3O4, confirming the existence of the MnCo2O4 interlayer. Notably, the LSM-20-Co catalyst showed comparable Tafel slope for both the ORR (65 mV dec(-1)) and the OER (82 mV dec(-1)) comparing with the Pt/C (58 mV dec(-1)) and IrO2 (114 mV dec(-1)), along with stable cycling performance over 450 min for alkaline Zinc-air battery. This work provides the rational design strategy of self-constructed interlayer via ALD process for efficient bi-functional electrocatalyst.									16	2	0	0	1	0	15			2211-2855	2211-3282		WOS:000530670200029

The localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) property of silver nanoprism leads to the blue color of the treated ESMs. UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy, scanning electron microscope (SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements were employed to observe the microstructure and surface property of Ag nanoprisms on the ESMs. The silver nanoprism-loaded eggshell membrane (AgNP@ESM) exhibited strong catalytic activity for the reduction of 4-nitrophenol by sodium borohydride (NaBH4) and it can be easily recovered and reused for more than six cycles. Significantly, the composites also display excellent SERS efficiency, allowing the in situ SERS monitoring of molecular transformation in heterogeneous catalysis. The results indicate that the AgNP@ESM biocomposite can achieve both SERS and catalytic functionalities simultaneously in a single entity with high performance, which promotes the potential applications of ESM modified with functional materials.									12	0	0	0	2	0	12			2073-4352			WOS:000395486800015

Zirconia-graphene composites are promising candidates as solid electrolytes for SOFC enabling efficient heat transfer and effective ion charge carriers movement. Herein, we report the change in electrochemical behavior of spark plasma sintered zirconia-reduced graphene oxide (YSZ-rGO) composites. The conductivity is shown to be altered from fully ionic to mixed electronicionic mode upon a small amount of rGO addition. Mixture of freeze-dried nano-sized yttria stabilized cubic zirconia (YSZ) powder and microwave sintered reduced graphene oxide (rGO) was utilized for the fabrication of YSZ-rGO ceramic composites. According to SEM and EBSD data, addition of rGO resulted in a bi-modal grain size distribution. The material with 2 wt.% rGO has demonstrated a mixed electron-ion conductivity in a wide temperature range of 294-1073 K in thermal cycling experiments at oxygen partial pressure of 10(-3)-10(-5) atm, where oxygen ion conductivity dominates over electronic one at elevated temperatures. The electrochemical stability of YSZ-2 wt.% rGO was tested by thermal cycling in nitrogen and argon atmospheres via impedance spectroscopy at 473-1073 K. The model to describe the conductivity evolution with temperature and thermal cycling has been suggested for the first time. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

Very recently, electrocatalytic and photo(electro) catalytic reduction of N-2 to NH3, which can be performed at ambient conditions using renewable energy, have received tremendous attention. The overall performance of these electrocatalytic and photo(electro) catalytic systems is largely dictated by their core components, catalysts. This perspective for the first time highlights the rational design of electrocatalysts and photo(electro) catalysts for N-2 reduction to NH3 under ambient conditions. Fundamental theory of catalytic reaction pathways for the N-2 reduction reaction and the corresponding material design principles are introduced first. Then, recently developed electrocatalysts and photo(electro) catalysts are summarized, with a special emphasis on the relationship between their physicochemical properties and NH3 production performance. Finally, the opportunities in this emerging research field, in particular, the strategy of combining experimental and theoretical techniques to design efficient and stable catalysts for NH3 production, are outlined.									914	64	0	0	42	0	923			1754-5692	1754-5706		WOS:000423017000003

ZnLaTaON2 photoelectrodes were prepared by electrophoretic deposition of ZnLaTaON2 suspension in acetone onto ITO substrate. The photoelectrodes of ZnLaTaON2 were established to reveal photoelectrochemical properties for water oxidation reaction. Moreover, a cobalt phosphate (Co-Pi) was loaded on ZnLaTaON2 photoelectrodes via photodeposition method to enhance the photoelectrochemical water oxidation performances. Photocurrent voltage characteristics of the Co-Pi/ZnLaTaON2 photoelectrodes were enhanced with its effect which is more evidenced at lower water oxidation potentials. A relatively stable photocurrent density of 5mA/cm(2) at 1.5V vs RHE was attained with the support of electron donor in alkaline phosphate solution. Comparatively, in Co-Pi/ZnLaTaON2 photoelectrodes, approximately threefold enhancement was noticed at 1.8 V-RHE in assessment with parent photoelectrode. On the other hand, Co-Pi/ZnLaTaON2 photoelectrodes have been shown as an alternative pathway to improve the photoelectrochemical current gain through the PEC water oxidation reaction.									7	0	0	0	1	0	7			0947-7047	1862-0760		WOS:000457774500035

Recently, modulating the surface structure of electrocatalysts to improve the catalytic activity has attracted a lot of attention. In particular, defect engineering is an important strategy to modulate the surface electronic structure of electrocatalysts. In this review, an overview of defects in metal, carbon materials, transition metal compounds, and defect-decorated catalysts is presented. The defect species, synthesis methods, characterization, and essential defect catalytic mechanism are introduced. Notably, tuning electronic structure to modulate the intermediates' adsorption energy is highlighted throughout the review. Finally, the design principles for defect electrocatalysts are proposed. The in-depth understanding of the structure-reactivity relationship will provide more profound guidance for the design of defect electrocatalysts and potential application in energy conversion and green synthesis.									181	16	0	0	12	0	181			1369-7021	1873-4103		WOS:000499663200017

In this work, by introducing the molecular sieve powder into the ether electrolyte, the Li-O-2 battery exhibits a largely improved discharge capacity (63 times) compared with the one in the absence of this inorganic oxide additive. Meanwhile, XRD and SEM results qualitatively demonstrate the generation of the toroid Li2O2 as the dominated discharge products, and the chemical titration quantifies a higher yield of the Li2O2 with the presence of the molecular sieve additive. The addition of the molecular sieve controls the amount of the free water in the electrolyte, which distinguishes the effect of the molecular sieve and the free water on the discharge process. Hence, a possible mechanism has been proposed that the adsorption of the molecular sieves toward the soluble lithium superoxides improves the disproportionation of the lithium superoxides and consequently enhances the solution-growth of the lithium peroxides in the low donor number ether electrolyte. In general, the application of the molecular sieve triggers further studies concerning the improvement of the discharge performance in the Li-O-2 battery by adding the inorganic additives.									19	3	0	0	1	0	20			1944-8244			WOS:000427204100050	29461029

The pore structure evolution and stability of FDU-15 functioned with the treatment temperature and time were systematically investigated in CO2, O-2 or water vapor atmospheres. A variety of techniques such as powder X-ray diffraction (XRD), nitrogen sorption and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) were used to characterize the thermal stability of the carbon mesostructure. N-2 sorption measurements show that the activation process can simply increase the specific surface area and pore volume of the mesoporous carbons. The effect of structural regularity, pore size, meso- or microporosity, and wall thickness on the thermal stability at different treatment temperature and time was discussed. The results show that mesoporous carbon FDU-15 materials after the carbonization at 900 degrees C have a good thermal stability under CO2 at 750 degrees C, O-2 at 350 degrees C and water vapor at 800 degrees C for at least 3 h. Nevertheless, CO2, O-2 or water vapor develops the pore system through different ways. For CO2, the thermal treatment leads to large mesopore volumes while the micropores are slightly increased during the carbon burn-off. Different from CO2, water vapor activation renders a continuous increase of micropore volumes as well as the total pore volumes with increasing the carbon burn-off. Under O-2-treatment at 350 degrees C, the ordered mesostructures can be rapidly destroyed due to the fast burning reactions of oxygen with mesoporous carbons. (C) 2007 Elsevier Inc.

The atomically dispersed and catalytically active metal atoms are necessarily anchored by surrounding atoms. As such, the structure and composition of anchoring sites significantly influence the catalytic performance of SACs even with the same metal element. Significant progress has been made to understand structure-activity relationships at an atomic level, but in-depth understanding in precisely designing highly efficient SACs for the targeted reactions is still required. In this review, various anchoring sites in SACs are summarized and classified into five different types (doped heteroatoms, defect sites, surface atoms, metal sites, and cavity sites). Then, their impacts on catalytic performance are elucidated for electrochemical reactions based on their distance from the metal center (first coordination shell and beyond). Further, SACs anchored on two typical types of hosts, carbon- and metal-based materials, are highlighted, and the effects of anchoring points on achieving the desirable atomic structure, catalytic performance, and reaction pathways are elaborated. At last, insights and outlook to the SAC field based on current achievements and challenges are presented.									19	0	0	0	0	0	19			0935-9648	1521-4095		WOS:000692263800001	34477254	
J	Ma, Ge; Zhang, Xiaoyu; Zhou, Guofu; Wang, Xin				Zhang, xiaoyu/GXA-3206-2022				Hydrogen production from methanol reforming electrolysis at NiO nanosheets supported Pt nanoparticles								CHEMICAL ENGINEERING JOURNAL				411						128292	10.1016/j.cej.2020.128292		JAN 2021		MAY 1 2021	2021	In this work, ultrathin NiO nanosheets (NS) supported Pt nanoparticles (NP) nanohybrids (termed as Pt-NP/NiONS) are synthesized by cyanogel-NaBH4 method, in-situ reduction and calcination treatment, in which the thickness of Pt-NP/NiO-NS nanohybrids is only 1.8 nm and their specific surface area is as large as 171.5 m(2) g(-1). The Pt-NP/NiO-NS nanohybrids can efficiently act as a versatile electrocatalyst for both methanol oxidation reaction (MOR) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in alkaline environment. At Pt-NP/NiO-NS nanohybrids, only a 57 mV overpotential is required to obtain a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) for HER. The MOR current at Pt-NP/NiO-NS nanohybrids can achieve 179.9 mA cm(-2) at 1.45 V potential, which is 15.9 times bigger than that at NiO-NS. The excellent electrocatalytic activity and durability of Pt-NP/NiO-NS nanohybrids can be ascribed to the morphology feature of NiO-NS and synergistic effect between Pt-NP and NiO-NS. The uniformly dispersed Pt NP at NiO-NS can serve as active sites for HER. Meanwhile, Pt-NP can modify the electronic property of NiO-NS, and boost the formation of active (NiOOH)-O-III species. Consequently, a symmetric Pt-NP/NiO-NS parallel to Pt-NP/NiO-NS methanol electrolyzer only requires 1.39 V electrolysis voltage for hydrogen production at cathode, accompanying with the production of value-added potassium formate at anode.									13	0	0	0	2	0	13			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000626524100003		
J	Wilson, JR; Mathews, GJ								White dwarfs near black holes: A new paradigm for type I supernovae								ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL				610	1			368	377		10.1086/421449				JUL 20 2004	2004	We present calculations indicating the possibility of a new class of Type I supernovae. In this new paradigm, relativistic terms enhance the self-gravity of a carbon-oxygen white dwarf as it passes or orbits near a black hole. This relativistic compression can cause the central density to exceed the threshold for pycnonuclear reactions so that a thermonuclear runaway ensues. We consider three possible environments: (1) white dwarfs orbiting a low-mass (similar to10-20 M-circle dot) black hole, (2) white dwarfs encountering a massive [similar to(1-3) x 10(3) M-circle dot] black hole in a dense globular cluster, and (3) white dwarfs passing a supermassive ( similar to10(6)-10(9) M-.) black hole in a dense galactic core. We estimate the rate at which such events could occur out to a redshift z approximate to 1. Event rates are estimated to be significantly less than the rate of normal Type Ia supernovae for all three classes. Nevertheless, such events may be frequent enough to warrant a search for this new class of supernova. We propose several observable signatures that might be used to identify this type of event and speculate that such an event might have produced the observed "mixed-morphology" Sgr A East supernova remnant in the Galactic core.									25	1	0	0	0	0	25			0004-637X	1538-4357		WOS:000222699700035

In this work the electrochemical performance of anodes fabricated from single source (anisotropic and isotropic) cokes, including an ultrapure graphite as reference material, was determined, and compared to the material properties of the cokes and baked anodes. Anodes were characterized for air and CO2 reactivity and optical texture, and cokes and anodes characterized for presence of oxygen surface groups and microstructure (fractions of basal, edge and defect sites on the surface and pore volume below 16 nm). Results show that anodes made from more isotropic cokes (increasing optical texture fineness) had a slight improvement in electrochemical performance compared to those made from more anisotropic cokes. For all anodes, electrochemical reactivity correlated with the electrochemically-wetted surface area, as determined by the double layer capacitance. This appears to be related to microstructure and possibly also to differences in surface chemistry, rather than differences in surface roughness and porosity as determined by optical techniques (i.e. on a mu m-scale).

The oxygen-poor atmosphere thermal annealing process assisted the formation of nonstoichiometric TaO2F mesocrystals with more F and Ta2O5 nanorods with oxygen vacancies and the associated lower valence state Ta ions (Ta4+). Furthermore, the carbon coating, decomposed from coated polydopamine, helped to control their particle size within 100 nm by isolating the connection of (NH4)2Ta2O3F6 subunits. Hence, as-synthesized products, particularly carbon-coated Ta2O5 nanosheets, owning large surface area (67.6 m2 g-1), fine particle size (<100 nm), excellent electronic conductivity, decreased bandgap energy, enhanced and extended absorption in the visible range, exhibited preferable photocatalytic activity in the photodegradation of methylene blue, reaching a 76.54 % and 41.71 % removal under ultraviolet and visible light illumination, suggesting a promising candidate for wide-range responsive photocatalytic applications.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			0272-8842	1873-3956		WOS:000724663100003

Herein, we present a method of preparation of a low-cost electrode, applying as a substrate a carbon fiber textile derived from a technical carbon fiber reinforced polymer. Noble-metal free composite films composed of cobalt-nickel alloy and amorphous Co,Ni(OH)(2) phases are obtained by a one-step electrodeposition process. Deposition is optimized in terms of the applied potential as well as metal ion concentration and Co/Ni ratio in an electroplating bath. The experimental results indicate that the hCT-Co0.4Ni0.6 electrode possesses the lowest HER overpotential of 150 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) in 1.0 M KOH, with negligible activity loss within 100 h of galvanostatic operation. A significant decrease of the overpotential and electrode stability boost are achieved thanks to the precise control of the bimetallic electrode composition, which affects the morphology, electrocatalytically active surface area and electronic properties of the material.									6	1	0	0	1	0	7			2398-4902			WOS:000503876500032

However, little attention has been paid to the nature of surface films which can grow via side reactions during the formation of NP-Au by selective leaching. These films could significantly impact both the kinetics of NP-Au formation by selective leaching, and the performance of this NP-Au in specific energy applications. While it has been reported that complete removal of Ag from a Au-Ag parent alloy by selective leaching is kinetically more sluggish in HClO4 than in HNO3, and that the resulting structure size of NP-Au is smaller when formed in HClO4 compared to HNO3, these findings were not attributed to the growth of surface film via side reactions during selective leaching. In this work, small-angle and wide-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS and WAXS) are used in real time during NP-Au formation by selective electrolytic leaching of Ag from a Au-Ag parent alloy in 1 M HClO4 and 1 M HNO3 to demonstrate that the sluggish dealloying behavior in HClO4 results from the growth of a surface film during dealloying. In HClO4, Ag+ ions released from the Au-Ag working electrode spontaneously react with Cl- ions released from ClO4- reduction at the counter electrode to form an insoluble AgCl passive film on NP-Au. The AgCl hinders Ag dissolution and surface diffusion of Au atoms, slowing down the reaction kinetics and the rate of ligament growth. Our findings shed light on dealloying reaction mechanisms and will contribute to better control of the morphology and surface chemical state of nanoporous metals for energy applications.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000683894500001

S-doped and N-doped TiO2 loaded with Fe2O3 nanoparticles have also been prepared. These photocatalysts showed activity under a wide range of wavelengths of irradiation. Action spectra of photochemical reaction rate as a function of the incident light wavelength for oxidation of acetic acid on S-doped TiO2 was studied. The photocatalytic activities of S-doped and N-doped TiO2 photocatalysts loaded with Fe2O3 nanoparticles for oxidation of acetic acid in aqueous phase and acetaldehyde in gas phase are markedly improved compared to those of doped TiO2 without loading of Fe2O3 nanoparticles under a wide range of incident light wavelengths. The optimum amount of Fe2O3 nanoparticles loaded on S-doped TiO2 particles was different from that on N-doped TiO2 for oxidation of organic compounds. The relationship between reaction rate of photocatalytic oxidation of acetaldehyde on doped TiO2 loaded with Fe2O3 nanoparticles and amount of Fe2O3 nanoparticles is discussed. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V.

J	Whitaker, Fiona F.; Smart, Peter L.								Geochemistry of meteoric diagenesis in carbonate islands of the northern Bahamas: 1. Evidence from field studies								HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES				21	7			949	966		10.1002/hyp.6532				MAR 30 2007	2007	Processes driving carbonate diagenesis in islands of the northern Bahamas are investigated using major ion, dissolved oxygen and dissolved organic carbon analyses of water samples from surface and ground waters, and measurements of soil gas P-CO2, Meteoric waters equilibrate with aragonite, but reactions are water controlled rather than mineral-controlled and drive dissolution rather than concurrent precipitation of calcite. Surface runoff waters equilibrate with atmospheric P-CO2 and rapidly recharge the vadose zone, limiting subaerial bedrock dissolution to only 6.6-1.5 mg l(-1) Ca. P-CO2 of soil gas measured in the summer wet season ((7.4 +/- 3.7) x 10(-3) atm) is elevated compared with that of the atmosphere, despite the thin skeletal organic nature of the soil and the discontinuous soil cover. Soil waters retained in surface pockets are equilibrated with respect to aragonite and have dissolved 51 +/- 19 mg l(-1) Ca. This is substantially less than the 93 +/- 18 mg l(-1) Ca in samples from pumping boreholes that sample meteoric waters from the freshwater lens. The high P-CO2 of the freshwater lens ((16 +/- 8.3) x 10(-3) atm for pumping boreholes) suggests that significant additional CO2 may be derived by oxidation of soil- and surface-derived organic carbon within the lens. The suboxic nature of the majority of the freshwater lens and the observed depletion in sulphate support this suggestion, and indicate that both aerobic and anaerobic oxidation may take place. Shallow lens samples from observation boreholes are calcite supersaturated and have a lower P-CO2 than deeper lens waters, indicating that CO2 degasses from the water table, driving precipitation of calcite cements. We suggest that the geochemical evolution of waters in the vadose zone and upper part of the freshwater lens may be determined by the presence of a body of ground air with P-CO2 controlled by production in the freshwater lens and soil and by degassing to the atmosphere.

Compared with green petals, there was a five-fold increase of the carotenoid content in yellow petals, whereas the chlorophyll content decreased five-fold. Absorption and emission fluorescence spectra of chromoplasts indicated that newly synthesized carotenoids were not associated with photosystem 11 (PSII) photochemistry. The maximum quantum yield in the remaining PSII reaction centers remained constant during the chromoplast formation, whereas the photosynthetic electron transport beyond PSII became inhibited, as indicated by a marked decrease of the 02 evolution capacity, of the photochemical quenching of chlorophyll-a fluorescence and of the operational quantum yield of photosynthetic electron transport. Deconvoluted fluorescence emission spectra indicated a more rapid degradation of photosystem I (PSI) complexes than of PSII during chromoplast formation. Compared with green petals, the spillover between PSII and PSI decreased by approximately 40% in yellow petals. Our results indicate that during chloroplast-chromoplast transition in the flower bud of L. longiflorum, PSII integrity was preserved longer than the rest of the photosynthetic apparatus.									13	0	0	0	13	0	14			0031-8655			WOS:000175038500008	12003127

Elemental composition, (atomic) structure, electrical conductivity, and electrochemical performance related to the oxygen reduction were investigated for electrodes carbonised in the range from 300 degrees C to 1400 degrees C. Chemical and structural properties were analysed using elemental analysis, XPS, SEM, and Raman spectroscopy; electrical conductivities of the fibre networks were examined by four-point probe measurements. Electrochemical properties were evaluated using linear sweep voltammetry in 6 M KOH by the open circuit potentials, the cathodic current densities at given overpotentials, and required overpotentials at given current densities. The highest current density was obtained from fibres carbonised at 850 degrees C. The connection between the fibre characteristics and electrochemical properties are discussed, highlighting the importance of the nitrogen bonding state. The results provide a base for thedevelopment of high performance air electrodes.									12	0	0	0	1	0	12				2046-2069		WOS:000487054800011	35529185

Thebatch systems were analysed over an 84 day reaction period, during which the liquid and nanoparticulate solids were periodically sampled to determine chemical evolution of the solutions and particulates.Results indicated that U was removed by all nano-Fe-0 systems to <10 mu g L-1 (>98% removal) within 2 h of reaction, below EPA and WHO specified drinking water regulations. Similar U concentrations were maintained until approximately 48 h. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analysis of the nanoparticulate solids confirmed partial chemical reduction of U-VI to U-IV concurrent with Fe oxidation. In contrast, nano-Fe3O4 failed to achieve >20% U removal from the Lisava water. Whilst the outer surface of both the nano-Fe-0 and nano-Fe3O4 was initially near-stoichiometric magnetite, the greater performance exhibited by nano-Fe-0 is attributed to the presence of a Fe core for enhanced aqueous reactivity, sufficient to achieve near-total removal of aqueous U despite any competing reactions within the carbonate-rich Lisava water.Over extended reaction periods (>1 week) the chemically simple U-VI-only solution treated using nano-Fe-0 exhibited near-complete and maintained U removal. In contrast, appreciable U re-release was recorded for the Lisava water solutions treated using nanoFe. This behaviour is attributed to the high stability of U in the presence of ligands (predominantly carbonate) within the Lisava water, inducing preferential re-release to the aqueous phase during nano-Fe-0 corrosion.The current study therefore provides clear evidence for the removal and immobilisation of U from environmental waters using Fe-based nanoparticles. As a contrast to previous experimental studies reporting impressive figures for U removal and retention from simple aqueous systems, the present work demonstrates both nanomaterials as ineffective on timescales >1 week. Consequently further research is required to develop nanomaterials that exhibit greater reactivity and extended retention of inorganic contaminants in chemically complex environmental waters.

Hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) is a crucial process for cost-effective hydrogen production; however, functional electrocatalysts are potentially desirable to expedite reaction kinetics and supply high energy density. Thus, the development of inexpensive and catalytically active electrocatalysts is one of the most significant and challenging issues in the field of electrochemical energy storage and conversion. Realizing that advanced nanomaterials could engender many advantageous chemical and physical properties over a wide scale, tremendous efforts have been devoted to the preparation of earth-abundant transition metals as electrocatalysts for HER in both acidic and alkaline environments because of their low processing costs, reasonable catalytic activities, and chemical stability. Among all transition metal-based catalysts, nickel compounds are the most widely investigated, and have exhibited pioneering performances in various electrochemical reactions. Heterostructured nickel phosphide (NixPy) based compounds were introduced as promising candidates of a new category, which often display chemical and electronic characteristics that are distinct from those of non-precious metals counterparts, hence providing an opportunity to construct new catalysts with an improved activity and stability. As a result, the library of NixPy catalysts has been enriched very rapidly, with the possibility of fine-tuning their surface adsorption properties through synergistic coupling with nearby elements or dopants as the basis of future practical implementation. The current review distils recent advancements in NixPy compounds/hybrids and their application for HER, with a robust emphasis on breakthroughs in composition refinement. Future perspectives for modulating the HER activity of NixPy compounds/hybrids, and the challenges that need to be overcome before their practical use in sustainable hydrogen production are also discussed.									23	1	0	0	0	0	23			2365-0869	2364-8961		WOS:000490054000001	31605243

Herein, we report the facile synthesis of chalcogen vacancy-rich (5-20%) transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD, i.e., MoS2, MoSe2, WS2, and WSe2) nanostructures for the (photo)electrocatalytic HER. Atomically resolved scanning transmission electron microscopy revealed the concentration of chalcogen (S and Se) vacancies, as well as the formation of double chalcogen vacancies at higher concentrations. Photocathodes consisting of a Si nanowire array sheathed in TMD layers exhibited excellent photoelectrocatalytic performance under AM 1.5 irradiation conditions. The photocurrent reached 30 mA cm(-2) (at 0 V vs. RHE) with a high faradaic efficiency (90%) and negligible degradation of the HER for 3 h. The free-standing TMD nanosheets exhibit excellent electrocatalytic HER performance (an overpotential of 162-202 mV vs. RHE for 10 mA cm(-2) and a Tafel slope of 70-84 mV dec(-1) in 0.5 M H2SO4), which can be correlated with the vacancy concentration. A detailed structural analysis suggested that the chalcogen vacancies play a major role in determining the catalytic activity toward the HER, which in turn is responsible for the enhanced PEC performance.									10	0	0	0	0	0	10			2050-7526	2050-7534		WOS:000607305700008

Firstly, porous MoO2-Mo2C@NC nanospheres have been obtained with ultrafine Mo2C nanocrystallines as core and ultrathin N-doped carbon (NC) as shell through the carbonization of MoO42--/aniline-pyrrole (MoO42--Polymer) as precursor. Secondly, Mo2C@NC@MoSx porous nanospheres with sandwich shell have been synthesized by hydrothermal sulfurization, which can be confirmed by XPS and HRTEM. The sandwich shell is composed of ultrathin MoSx, NC layer and Mo2C nanocrystallines, which may reduce the strong Mo-H bonding energy of pure Mo2C and lead to the suitable Delta GH* for HER. In addition, the ultrathin NC can prevent the aggregation of active sites and improve charge transfer rate due to rich N-doping. Mo2C@NC@ MoSx exhibits enhanced performance and long-time durability in both acidic and alkaline solution. It requires a low onsetpotential of 119 mV, Tafel slope of 56 mV dec(-1) in acidic solution and onsetpotential of 86 mV, Tafel slope of 90 mV dec(-1) in alkaline solution. Therefore, designing sandwich nanostructure with better conductivity and optimized MoeH bonding energy may be a promising strategy for excellent Mo-based HER electrocatalysts. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Biokhimiia (Moscow, Russia)				48	5			857	60						1983-May	1983	The uncoupling effects of gramicidine and NH4Cl on the light-induced electron transport were studied in isolated pea chloroplasts placed in H2O- or D2O-media. Gramicidine at 10(-6) M had no uncoupling effect on the rate of ferricyanide-supported O2 evolution in a D2O-medium, but enhanced the ferricyanide reduction in a H2O-medium and completely inhibited the light-induced alkalinization both in H2O- and D2O-suspended chloroplasts. The rate of electron transport with methylviologen as an acceptor was gramicidine-sensitive (uncoupling) both in preparations with H2O and D2O. In D2O-suspended chloroplasts the phosphorylation activity was retained as well as control of ferricyanide-dependent electron flow by ADP--phosphate and NH4Cl. It was assumed that some electron carriers on the inner surface of thylakoid membranes become inaccessible to ferricyanide upon deuteration.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0320-9725			MEDLINE:6191783	6191783

The characteristic self-limiting ALD growth with a growth-per-cycle of 0.1 nm per cycle and digital thickness control down to a monolayer are observed with excellent wafer scale uniformity. The as-deposited films are found to be polycrystalline in nature showing the signature Raman and photoluminescence signals for the mono-to-few layered regime. Furthermore, a transformation in film morphology from in-plane to out-of-plane orientation of the 2-dimensional layers as a function of growth temperature is observed. An extensive study based on high-resolution transmission electron microscopy is presented to unravel the nucleation mechanism of MoS2 on SiO2/Si substrates at 450 degrees C. In addition, a model elucidating the film morphology transformation (at 450 degrees C) is hypothesized. Finally, the out-of-plane oriented films are demonstrated to outperform the in-plane oriented films in the hydrogen evolution reaction for water splitting applications.									70	2	0	0	1	0	70			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000432096400031	29696289

The results reveal that the Pd1Ni1/C and Pd1Cu1/C bimetallic catalysts exhibit high catalytic activity 4.1 and 3.9 times higher than that of the commercial Pd/C catalyst. Combined with the X-ray diffraction (XRD), High-resolution transmission electron microscopy(HRTEM) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis, the charge transfer between Pd and Cu(or Ni) alters the electron density of Pd and enhances the anti-CO poisoning ability, which is confirmed by DFT (Density Functional Theory) calculations. The CO binding energy is weakened on various bimetallic surfaces compared with that on Pd(111), consistent with experimental results. A linear relationship exists between the CO binding energy and the catalytic activity on the bimetallic catalysts, indicating that the CO binding energy may be the potential descriptor for MOR in alkaline media.

To achieve efficient overall water splitting of g-C3N4 without the assistance of precious metals, herein, a WC1-x-coupled 3D porous defect g-C3N4 is constructed through simple one-step pyrolysis. Due to the introduction of platinum-like WC1-x, the effective heterogenization of WC1-x/g-C3N4 greatly improves the charge separation. In the meanwhile, the 3D multiple microstructures established by the self-protocol of ultrathin 2D g-C3N4 nanosheets enhance the light absorption efficiency and optimize the separation of photoexcited carriers. Significantly, the generation of nitrogen defects is capable of bringing about an optimized band structure. Based on those modifications, a significant photocatalytic overall water splitting capacity under visible light is obtained without the sacrificial agent by the prepared 3D WC1-x/g-C3N4, in which the simultaneous evolution of H-2 and O-2 was up to 84.1 and 41.7 mu molh(-1)g(-1), respectively.									27	3	0	0	0	0	27			2367-198X			WOS:000484089200004

Comprehensive structural (XRD, FESEM, and HRTEM), compositional (XPS depth profiling), and electrochemical (EIS and Mott-Schottky) analyses were performed to understand the effect of PRED treatment on the PEC performance of fabricated photoanodes. It is revealed that air-exposed Fe foil is prone to formation of a loosely bound surface oxide layer that, upon annealing at 800 degrees C, results in an unstable Fe2O3 nano-flake (2-3 mu m long) morphology. In contrast, when such Fe foil is pre-treated with PRED to etch the loosely bound oxide layer, adherent inverse-opal-like nano-coral structures (60-100 nm thin) are formed. In addition to stability improvement, PRED-treatment also assists in exposing the photocatalytically active high index [104] facet sites of hematite. Thin hematite nano-coral structures with high index [104] facet sites significantly improved the separation of photo-generated charge carriers and oxygen evolution kinetics, resulting in performance enhancement with excellent photocurrent stability for extended duration in a 1 M NaOH solution under one sun illumination. The net photocurrent density for nano-coral morphology was 0.813 mA cm(-2) at 1.23 V vs. RHE, which is the highest reported value for pristine hematite photoanodes fabricated from Fe foil.									14	1	0	0	3	0	14			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000360831100014	26300305

Here, we present a theoretical and experimental study to demonstrate that ternary Ni2(1-x)Mo2xP porous nanowire arrays grown on Ni foam, as a highly efficient and stable electrocatalyst toward alkaline HER under large-current-density. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that Mo substitution of Ni in Ni2P leads to optimal free energy of water activation and hydrogen adsorption on the catalyst surface. Benefiting from the enhanced intrinsic activity, large active surface area and fast gas releasing, the Ni2(1-x)Mo2xP catalyst exhibits an excellent HER activity with low overpotentials of 72, 240, and 294 mV at current densities of 10, 500, and 1000 mA cm(-2), respectively, along with superior stability in 1 M KOH. This highly active and stable catalyst enables an electrolyzer operating at 10 mA cm(-2) at a voltage of 1.51 V, 100 mA cm(-2) at 1.65 V, and 500 mA cm(-2) at 1.82 V in 1 M KOH at room temperature, which are much better than the benchmark of IrO2/Pt. Our 3D ternary Ni2(1-x)Mo2xP catalysts significantly advance the science and technology for commercial hydrogen production.									147	6	0	0	11	0	149			2211-2855	2211-3282		WOS:000448994600055

Compounding this natural variation, salt marshes are often heavily impacted by anthropogenic insults including eutrophication, toxic contamination, and coastal development that alter tidal and freshwater inputs. Commensurate with this environmental variability, estuarine animals generally exhibit broader physiological tolerances than freshwater, marine, or terrestrial species. One factor that determines an organism's physiological tolerance is its ability to upregulate "stress-response genes" in reaction to particular stressors. Comparative studies on diverse organisms have identified a number of evolutionarily conserved genes involved in responding to abiotic and biotic stressors. We used homology-based scans to survey the sequenced genome of Nematostella vectensis, the starlet sea anemone, an estuarine specialist, to identify genes involved in the response to three kinds of insult-physiochemical insults, pathogens, and injury. Many components of the stress-response networks identified in triploblastic animals have clear orthologs in the sea anemone, meaning that they must predate the cnidarian-triploblast split (e.g., xenobiotic receptors, biotransformative genes, ATP-dependent transporters, and genes involved in responding to reactive oxygen species, toxic metals, osmotic shock, thermal stress, pathogen exposure, and wounding). However, in some instances, stress-response genes known from triploblasts appear to be absent from the Nematostella genome (e.g., many metal-complexing genes). This is the first comprehensive examination of the genomic stress-response repertoire of an estuarine animal and a member of the phylum Cnidaria. The molecular markers of stress response identified in Nematostella may prove useful in monitoring estuary health and evaluating coastal conservation efforts.

Simultaneous chemical modification of a polyorganosilazane as well as its cross-linking was achieved by the use of an aminopyridinato palladium complex at room temperature. Cross-linking takes place with an evolution of hydrogen and increases the ceramic yield by the retention of carbon and nitrogen atoms. Liberation of ligand, as confirmed by H-1 NMR spectroscopy, provides indirect evidence of the transfer of palladium to the nitrogen functions producing metal modified polyorganosilazane whose pyrolysis at 1100 degrees C under nitrogen atmosphere provides Pd2Si@SiCN. Powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) studies confirmed the presence of the hexagonal Pd2Si phase in the amorphous SiCN matrix. The size of the particles formed seems to depend upon the nature of the solvent used in the cross-linking step. The amount of palladium complex added seems not to affect the size of particles formed but does increase their population density. Pd2Si@SiCN catalysts were found active for the hydrogenation of ketones. The selectivity of the reaction towards the alcoholic product remains very high. The conversion of the reaction however decreases both with increase in alkyl chain length as well as its branching at alpha carbon. The recyclable Pd2Si@SiCN could be a suitable choice for catalytic transformations under a harsh chemical environment and at higher temperatures.									39	0	0	0	2	0	39			0959-9428	1364-5501		WOS:000297072000048

PCC 6803 and higher plants. psbL, a 4.5 kDa protein encoded by this gene, is a component of the photosystem II complex. The amino acid sequence of this protein indicates that it has a single membrane-spanning alpha-helical domain. We have used a targeted mutagenesis technique to delete the coding region of the psbL gene in Synechocystis 6803. The resultant mutant strain T345 did not show any PSII-mediated oxygen evolution activity and, as a result, could not grow under photoautotrophic conditions. However, it had normal PSI activity. The chlorophyll to phycobilin ratio in the T345 cells was significantly lower than that in the wild type cells. Fluorescence emission spectra (77 K) of the mutant cells showed the absence of a 695 nm band that usually originates from the PSII complex. Binding assays with radioactive diuron demonstrated that the mutant cells did not have any herbicide binding activity. However, immunostaining experiments showed that both the D1 (the herbicide binding protein) and the D2 proteins of the PSII reaction center were present at > 25% of their normal levels in the thylakoid membranes of the T345 mutant cells. Our data indicate that the PsbL protein is essential for the normal functioning of PSII.

The electron energy conservation equation is coupled to the electron continuity equation, the heavy species continuity equation, and Poisson's equation for a better description. The reliability of the model is experimentally confirmed. The model can be used to predict the temporal and spatial evolution of species, as well as streamer propagation. The simulation results show that electron density increases nearly exponentially in the direction to the anode at the electron avalanche. Streamer propagation velocity is about 5.26x10(4) m/s from anode to cathode in the simulated condition. The primary positive ion, negative ion, and excited species are (i), O-2(+) and O-3(-) ((1)Delta g) in pulsed DBD in air, respectively. N2O has the largest density among nitrogen oxides. c and N-2(+) densities in the streamer head increase gradually to maximum values with the development of the streamer. Meanwhile, the (i), O, O-3, N-2 (A(3)Sigma) and N2O densities reach maximum values in the vicinity of the anode.									12	6	0	0	0	0	14			1009-0630			WOS:000369632200009

However, the biggest problem of Pd nanocatalysts for alcohol oxidations is that they show the limited stability and activity, greatly impacting the development of liquid fuels-based fuel cell technology. We report herein a new solvent-induced procedure for making distinct Pd NCs with geometry tuning from Pd nanosheets, Pd tetrapods, to Pd concave tetrahedra by switching the solvent from 1-methyl-2-pyrrolidone, formamide, to acetylacetonate. The key features for the preparation of dimension-controlled Pd NCs herein are that the use of molybdenum carbonyl (Mo(CO)(6)) determines the exposed {111} facet in the final Pd NCs, while different solvents control the reduction kinetics to induce the growth of Pd NCs with distinct morphologies. The as-prepared distinct Pd NCs show the interesting shape-dependent electrocatalytic activities toward multiple liquid fuels electrooxidation reactions including ethylene glycol oxidation reaction, glycerol oxidation reaction, ethanol oxidation reaction, and also methanol oxidation reaction with Pd nanosheets exhibiting higher activity than all the other Pd catalysts and higher activity than the commercial Pd/C and also Pd black due to the thin character of Pd nanosheets. Most importantly, the Pd nanosheets exhibit much higher stability for multiple liquid fuels electrooxidation than all the other Pd catalysts tested. The present work gives the first example in exploring the effect of solvent in tuning the dimensions of Pd NCs, and thus optimizing the electrocatalytic performance for liquid fuels electrooxidation.									27	2	0	0	1	0	28			1944-8244			WOS:000381715900016	27442912

However, intermittent power supply and unpredictable power cut by renewable energy resources inevitably compel the electrode materials to suffer from the fluctuant working conditions or repeated start/stop operation, which always leads the deterioration of electrocatalyst. Herein, a novel hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) electrode with hierarchical NiMoN microrod arrays encapsulated by nitrogen doped ultra-thin carbon layer and in-situ grown on nickel foam (labelled NF) was reported. The prepared NiMoN@NC/NF electrode exhibits extremely low overpotentials less than 10 mV at 10 mA cm-2 for HER in both KOH and H2SO4 electrolytes. Importantly, it exhibits not only high stability during the 100 h repeated ON/OFF test, but also high oxidation resistance and corrosion resistance in acid electrolyte. The water electrolysis cell, using 100 cm2 NiMoN@NC/NF cathode and NiFe based anode, supplies a high current density of 100 mA cm-2 with a low cell voltage of 1.53 V at 88 degrees C. The appropriate nitrogen doping, carbon encapsulation, and the well-designed hierarchical structure of the NiMoN@NC/NF endow its optimized Gibbs free energy of H*, excellent activity and outstanding adaptability to harsh conditions, demonstrating its great prospect in the repeated ON/OFF electrolysis associated with changeful renewable electricity.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000779498500003

The best-performing materials (III/V semiconductors) require surface passivation, as they are liable to corrosion, and a surface co-catalyst to facilitate water splitting. At present, optimal design combining photoelectrodes with oxygen evolution catalysts remains a significant materials challenge. Here, we demonstrate that nickel-coated amorphous three-dimensional (3D) TiO(2)core-shell nanorods on a TiO(2)thin film function as an efficient hole-extraction layer and serve as a protection layer for the GaAs photoanode. Transient-absorption spectroscopy (TAS) demonstrated the role of nickel-coated (3D) TiO(2)core-shell nanorods in prolonging photogenerated charge lifetimes in GaAs, resulting in a higher catalytic activity. This strategy may open the potential of utilizing this low-cost (3D) nanostructured catalyst for decorating narrow-band-gap semiconductor photoanodes for PEC water splitting devices.									2	1	0	0	0	0	2			1864-5631	1864-564X		WOS:000577608800001	32986913

Herein, three-dimensional (3D) Ni3FeN nano-particles/reduced graphene oxide (r-GO) aerogel electrocatalysts were fabricated using precursors of (Ni,Fe)/r-GO alginate hydrogels through an ion-exchange process, followed by a convenient one-step nitro-genization treatment in NH3 at 700 degrees C. The resultant materials exhibited excellent electrocatalytic performance for OER and HER in alkaline media, with only small overpotentials of 270 and 94 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2), respectively. The good performance was attributed to abundant active sites and high electrical conductivity of the bimetallic nitrides and efficient mass transport of the 3D r-GO aerogel framework. Furthermore, an alkaline electrolyzer was set up using Ni3FeN/r-GO as both the cathode and the anode, which achieved a 10 mA cm(-2) current density at 1.60 V with durability of 100 h for overall water splitting. Density functional theory calculations support that Ni3FeN (111)/r-GO is more favorable for overall water splitting since the surface electronic structure of Ni3FeN is tuned by transferring electrons from Ni3FeN cluster to the r-GO through interaction of two metal species. Thus, the currently developed Ni3FeN/r-GO with superior water-splitting performance may potentially serve as a material for use in industrial alkaline water electrolyzers.									356	22	0	0	12	0	361			1936-0851	1936-086X		WOS:000423495200026	29257880

Illumination at 200 K enhances the signal intensity of TyrD(.) by a factor of >40 compared to the signal obtained from dark-adapted samples. This signal enhancement and the unusual line shape of the TyrD(.) resonance result from the magnetic dipolar coupling of the radical to the manganese cluster involved in oxygen evolution. The relative angular orientation of the manganese cluster with respect to TyrD(.) has been determined from line-shape analysis. The resonance arising from TyrD(.) in Tris-washed manganese-free photosystem II sample is also distorted. This effect probably originates from the influence of the nonheme iron on the spin relaxation of the tyrosyl radical. The relative angular orientation of the nonheme iron has also been determined. Oriented samples were used to determine the angular orientation of TyrD(.) with respect to the membrane plane. Combining angular data with published distances, we have constructed a three-dimensional picture of the relative positions of TyrD(.), the manganese cluster, and the nonheme iron. The data suggest a more symmetrical placement of the manganese relative to TyrD(.) and TyrZ, the tyrosine involved in electron transfer, than is usually assumed in current models of photosystem II.									56	0	0	0	26	0	56			0027-8424			WOS:A1994NR27500010	8202479

The optimized WO3-NRs/BiVO4 photoanode modified with Co-Pi oxygen evolution co-catalyst shows remarkably stable photocurrents of 3.2 and 5.1 mA/cm(2) at 1.23 V versus a reversible hydrogen electrode in a stable Na2SO4 electrolyte under simulated solar light at the standard 1 Sun and concentrated 2 Suns illumination, respectively. The photocurrent enhancement is attributed to the faster charge separation in the electronically thin BiVO4 layer and significantly reduced charge recombination. The enhanced light trapping in the nanostructured WO3-NRs/BiVO4 photoanode effectively increases the optical thickness of the BiVO4 layer and results in efficient absorption of the incident light.									181	9	0	0	17	0	182			1613-6810	1613-6829		WOS:000342687700015	24863862

X-ray diffraction (XRD), field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM), energy dispersive spectrometry (EDS), and linear scanning voltammetry (LSV) were used to scrutinize the coating material and the electrochemical activity. The concentration of phenol, the value of total organic carbon (TOC), the mineralization current efficiency (MCE) and the ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy (UV-Vis) spectrum of phenol solution were measured over the electrochemical degradation process of phenol to confirm the phenol degradation characterization of Ti/SnO2-Sb-Mo electrodes. Results showed that the electrode at the Mo content of 1 at.% provided optimal catalytic activity for phenol degradation and the longest life time. The removal percentage of phenol and TOC were 99.62% and 82.67%, respectively. The Ti/SnO2-Sb-Mo electrode with 1 at.% of Mo reached maximum MCE of phenol oxidation. The kinetic investigation of phenol and TOC degradation displayed the pseudo-first order reaction model. The Ti/SnO2-Sb-Mo electrode coating with 7 at.% Mo presented the highest oxygen evolution overpotential, indicating the diverse effects for different Mo molar ratio doping.

In the present work, CdSe QDs coupled with different weight percent of ultra-thin layered hexagonal porous boron nitride sheets (h-PBNs) functionalized with 3-mercaptopropionic acid (3-MPA) have been synthesized and studied for photocatalytic hydrogen (H-2) evolution reaction. The h-PBNs/CdSe heterostructure with 30 wt% optimized loading shows an excellent photocatalytic H-2 evolution of 25 128 mu mol g(-1) h(-1) which is 18.6 times higher than that offered by solely functionalized h-PBNs. The remarkable photocatalytic H-2 evolution benefits are anticipated to be attained owing to factors like the high specific surface area of porous h-PBNs (409 m(2) g(-1)), which allows a uniform deposition of CdSe QDs on the surface providing more adsorption sites, and the presence of the thiol group on 3-MPA which strongly tethers the CdSe QDs to the h-PBNs which effectively reduces the photogenerated charge recombination as confirmed by PL and EIS studies. The 30% h-PBNs/CdSe photoelectrode shows excellent photoelectrochemical (PEC) performance. The photocurrent density achieved by the 30% h-PBNs/CdSe heterostructure is 1.2 mA cm(-2) at 1.2 V vs. Ag/AgCl, which is 4.13-fold and 2.56-fold higher compared to that achieved by h-PBNs and CdSe QDs. This study reveals that the 30% h-PBNs/CdSe heterostructure forms the type II heterojunction which offers new insight into the development of a heterojunction system for effective photocatalytic H-2 evolution from water.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			2050-7526	2050-7534		WOS:000665087000001

Efficient water oxidation is achieved by doping with 1.8% Mo, resulting in a several-fold enhancement in photooxidation rate versus non-doped BiVO4. Two techniques are used to study the effect of Mo doping on the electron transport: (1) an analysis of the front/ back illumination ratio of incident photon-to-current efficiency and (2) intensity modulated photocurrent spectroscopy. These techniques show that Mo doping improves the diffusion coefficient four-fold and increases the diffusion length to ca. 300 nm (from 10 nm for the non-doped material), which is also the empirically-determined optimal Mo: BiVO4 film thickness for photoelectrolysis. These films are found to have a 90% charge separation efficiency and an 80% absorbed photon-to-current efficiency, excellent values for metal oxide photoabsorbers. Among the many oxygen evolution catalysts studied, surface modification with iron oxyhydroxide (FeOOH), a simple earth abundant catalyst, dramatically enhances the water oxidation performance of Mo: BiVO4 to an integrated IPCE of 2.41 mA cm(-2) and a photocurrent density of 2.77 mA cm(-2) in neutral phosphate at 1.23 V vs. RHE.									153	5	0	0	7	0	154			1463-9076	1463-9084		WOS:000328643900036	24287501

However, they still suffer from poor electron-hole separation and sluggish oxygen evolution dynamics, leading to the low photoconversion efficiency and limiting commercial application. Here, we designed and fabricated novel ternary non-noble metal carbonate hydroxide (ZNC-CH) nanosheet cocatalysts and integrated them with TiO2 nanorod arrays as highly efficient photoanodes of PEC cells. Compared with the pristine TiO2 , the photocurrent of photoanode with the optimal amount of ZNC-CH represents 3.2 times enhancement, and the onset potential is shifted toward the negative potential direction of 62 mV. The remarkable enhancement is attributed to the suppressed carrier recombination and enhanced charge transfer efficiency at the interface of TiO2 , ZNC-CH and electrolyte, which is closely related to the zinc elements modulated intrinsic activity of catalysts. Our results demonstrate that the introduction of multimetallic ZNC-CH cocatalysts onto photoanodes is a promising strategy to improve the PEC efficiency.

In the present study, we revise and update Raffelts database, including also constraints from RR Lyrae pulsation, and find that a small increase, of Delta M(c) approximate to 0.01 +/- 0.015 M(.), cannot be ruled out with the present data and evolutionary models. Our new upper limits on Delta M(c) are less restrictive than those previously obtained by Raffelt, as are the corresponding constraints on novel astroparticle phenomena that may affect the evolution of low-mass red giants. Within the estimated uncertainties, however, the standard values of M(c) may also be acceptable. Raffelts method does not rule out a low envelope helium abundance in globular cluster giants, though again the standard values are compatible with the available constraints. The influence of a nonsolar ratio for the alpha-capture elements upon these results is also investigated. In addition, we review several aspects of the input physics employed in red giant stellar evolutionary calculations, with the purpose of evaluating possible sources of uncertainty in the value of the helium-core mass at the helium hash that is obtained from evolutionary computations, such as heat conduction by electrons in the degenerate core; Coulomb effects upon the equation of state; triple-alpha reaction rates and screening factors; neutrino emission rates, both standard and enhanced by a possible nonzero magnetic moment; stellar rotation; microscopic element diffusion; and energy losses by axions and weakly interacting massive particles (WIMPs).									60	0	0	0	0	0	60			0004-637X	1538-4357		WOS:A1996UD64600018		
J	MAZUREK, M								PHASE-EQUILIBRIA AND OXYGEN ISOTOPES IN THE EVOLUTION OF METAPELITIC MIGMATITES - A CASE-STUDY FROM THE PRE-ALPINE BASEMENT OF NORTHERN SWITZERLAND								CONTRIBUTIONS TO MINERALOGY AND PETROLOGY				109	4			494	510		10.1007/BF00306552				FEB 1992	1992	Metapelites that have undergone variable degrees of migmatization were encountered in two deep boreholes in Northern Switzerland. Microtextures and calculated phase diagrams yield three successive stages of metamorphism, consistent with one P-T loop: (1) Amphibolite-grade metamorphism (biotite-sillimanite-garnet-oligoclase-quartz-ilmenite), P-T conditions are estimated at 4.5-6.5 kbars/550-650-degrees-C. (2) Anatectic migmatization at < 4.5 kbars/ > 650-degrees-C. Liquid was generated by incongruent melting reactions. Leucosomes do not represent pure crystallized melt but rather a mixture of melt, cordierite and K-feldspar grown at the expense of biotite and silimanite. (3) Retrograde hydration, recorded by the growth of large amounts of muscovite at the expense of cordierite and K-feldspar, P-T conditions are estimated at < 2.5 kbars/ < 600-degrees-C. Oxygen isotope measurements were obtained for whole-rocks and eight mineral species. Isotopic equilibrium among three or even four minerals grown during stage 1 can be demonstrated. Calculated isotopic temperatures are consistent with phase petrology. Migmatization did not re-equilibrate the isotopic composition of the pre-existing quartz grown in stage 1 even over distances as little as 10 cm. High delta-O-18 in migmatitic quartz is best explained by disequilibrium melting in coexistence with an infiltrating, isotopically heavy fluid. Lack of equilibration of oxygen isotopes between different quartz generations suggests that mineralogical and geochemical changes were rapid relative to diffusion rates. A meteoric-hydrothermal alteration at 300-400-degrees-C, probably genetically linked to the intrusion of Variscan granites, strongly affected the rocks. Quartz did not exchange isotopes with hydrothermal fluids except in segregations where it is recrystallized. The delta-O-18 values of micas, feldspars and cordierite are often very low and fractionations with quartz very large, which reflects significant hydrothermal effects that were previously detected in the Black Forest by other workers.									10	0	0	0	0	1	11			0010-7999			WOS:A1992HE29900007		
J	Muthuraman, G.; Moon, Il-Shik								Nucleation and Growth Study of Nano-PbO2 on Ti in Different Additives for Electrocatalytic Oxidation Process								JOURNAL OF NANOSCIENCE AND NANOTECHNOLOGY				13	8			5887	5890		10.1166/jnn.2013.7063				AUG 2013	2013	Electrocrystallization of PbO2 on Ti electrode was studied in different bath solutions using cyclic voltammetry (CV), chronoamperometry (CA), and scanning electron microscopy. The cyclic voltammetry studies revealed that the addition of methanol postponed the oxygen evolution region and made over potential nucleation of PbO2 on Ti. Oxidation of PbO2 is preferred in second cycle (a peak) in other studied bath solutions, except the Nafion and aniline containing solution. In the presence of the pyrrole, the PbO2 formed at under deposition potential with less in numbers. Nafion and aniline inclusion turn the process in to progressive nucleation and growth without inhibition. On the other hand, other solutions studied are revealed the instantaneous nucleation and growth or inhibition at high potentials. Surface morphology explained that congruent to 300 nm sizes PbO2 particles with vertical nucleation and growth phenomena evidenced the Nation and aniline are the important dopants. The results indicated that large current density or high potential polarization can be obtained in presence of methanol, Nation, and aniline, which is one of the most important and necessary factors for forming high surface area PbO2 with strong adherence towards mediated electro-oxidation process.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1533-4880	1533-4899		WOS:000320632200109	23882855	
J	Siegbahn, PEM								Quantum chemical studies of manganese centers in biology								CURRENT OPINION IN CHEMICAL BIOLOGY				6	2			227	235		10.1016/S1367-5931(02)00312-5				APR 2002	2002	During the past five years, hybrid density functional theory has been used to study mechanisms for redox-active enzymes containing complexes with a variety of different transition metals. In this paper, suggested mechanisms of some manganese enzymes are described. For photosystem II, a mechanism is proposed leading to an oxyl radical in the S-3-state, which is the precursor for the O-O bond formation. For manganese catalase, the suggested mechanism instead leads to the formation of a hydroxyl radical after the O-O bond of hydrogen peroxide is cleaved. This radical is immediately quenched by a manganese center. Parallels between these enzymes are highlighted. Jahn-Teller and traps effects are emphasized.									78	1	0	0	21	0	78			1367-5931	1879-0402		WOS:000174821700017	12039009

Stable aqueous solutions that contain both Bi3+ and V5+ complexes were prepared by simply mixing two aqueous solutions in which each cation was stabilized with an appropriate chelating agent. The use of chelating agents (glycolic acid (gly), L(+)-tartaric acid (tart), citric acid (cit), or ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid (edta)) was effective to form stable V5+ complexes from NH4VO3. On the other hand, only the use of two equivalents of edta with Bi(NO3)(3).5H(2)O was effective to stabilize the Bi3+ complex in water, while the use of other ligands resulted in precipitations. Evaporation of the aqueous solution containing the stable Bi3+ and V5+ complexes and subsequent calcination in air at 500 degrees C yielded s-m BiVO4 particles smaller than 300 nm, which were much smaller than BiVO4 particles prepared via conventional solid-state reactions (1-10 mu m). In particular, the BiVO4 particles that were prepared with the tart ligand for V5+ stabilization possessed the smallest size (similar to 80 nm) and exhibited the highest photocatalytic activity for O-2 evolution from an aqueous solution containing an electron acceptor (Ag+ or Fe3+) under visible-light irradiation. These results strongly suggested that the tart ligand effectively suppresses particle growth during the crystallization process and thereby affords small BiVO4 particles with high crystallinity, both of which are necessary to achieve highly efficient photocatalysis.									17	0	0	0	1	0	17			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000371967000042

The derived one-dimensional, non-LTE Li-7 abundances from the Li I 670.8 nm line reveal a pronounced dependence on metallicity but with negligible scatter around this trend. Very good agreement is found between the abundances from the Li I 670.8 nm line and the Li I 610.4 nm line. The estimated primordial Li-7 abundance is Li-7/H (1.1-1.5) x 10(-10), which is a factor of 3-4 lower than predicted from standard big bang nucleosynthesis with the baryon density inferred from the cosmic microwave background. Interestingly, Li-6 is detected in 9 of our 24 stars at the >= 2 sigma significance level. Our observations suggest the existence of a Li-6 plateau at the level of log epsilon(6Li) approximate to 0.8; however, taking into account predictions for Li-6 destruction during the pre-main-sequence evolution tilts the plateau such that the Li-6 abundances apparently increase with metallicity. Our most noteworthy result is the detection of Li-6 in the very metal-poor star LP 815-43. Such a high Li-6 abundance during these early Galactic epochs is very difficult to achieve by Galactic cosmic-ray spallation and alpha-fusion reactions. It is concluded that both Li isotopes have a pre-Galactic origin. Possible Li-6 production channels include protogalactic shocks and late-decaying or annihilating supersymmetric particles during the era of big bang nucleosynthesis. The presence of Li-6 limits the possible degree of stellar Li-7 depletion and thus sharpens the discrepancy with standard big bang nucleosynthesis.									396	6	0	0	2	0	399			0004-637X	1538-4357		WOS:000238339200021

The complex catalytic mechanism of this enzyme reaction has emerged as the controversial subject of several biochemical and computational studies. These studies all used the structure of the gamma-glutamyl cysteine utilizing sulfoxide synthase, MthEgtB from Mycobacterium thermophilum (EC 1.14.99.50), as a structural basis. To provide an alternative model system, we have solved the crystal structure of CthEgtB from Chloracidobacterium thermophilum (EC 1.14.99.51) that utilizes cysteine as a sulfur donor. This structure reveals a completely different configuration of active site residues that are involved in oxygen binding and activation. Furthermore, comparison of the two EgtB structures enables a classification of all ergothioneine biosynthetic EgtBs into five subtypes, each characterized by unique active-site features. This active site diversity provides an excellent platform to examine the catalytic mechanism of sulfoxide synthases by comparative enzymology, but also raises the question as to why so many different solutions to the same biosynthetic problem have emerged.									22	1	0	0	11	0	23			0002-7863	1520-5126		WOS:000463843700032	30883103

Consideration of the local minima and transition states for various routes of the association of oxo- and hydroxo-centers reveals a determinative role of the oxyl radical center Fe-III-O center dot- in facilitating this process. The preferable scenario comprises two steps: (1) the abstraction of the electron and proton from the initial complex leaving behind a ferryl FeO group, and (2) the incorporation of ferryl oxygen into the tetramer edge to form peroxo group.

The role of the PSI-N subunit in the PSI complex was investigated in transgenic Arabidopsis plants which were generated using antisense and cosuppression strategies. Several lines without detectable levels of PSI-N were identified. The plants lacking PSI-N assembled a functional PSI complex and were capable of photoautotrophic growth. When grown on agar media for several weeks the plants became chlorotic and developed significantly more slowly. However, under optimal growth conditions, the plants without PSI-N were visually indistinguishable from the wild-type although several photosynthetic parameters were affected. In the transformants, the second-order rate constant for electron transfer from plastocyanin to P700(+), the oxidized reaction centre of PSI, was only 55% of the wild-type value, and steady-state NADP(+) reduction was decreased to a similar extent. Quantum yield of oxygen evolution and PSII photochemistry were about 10% lower than in the wild-type at leaf level. Photochemical fluorescence quenching was lowered to a similar extent. Thus, the 40-50% lower activity of PSI at the molecular level was much less significant at the whole-plant level. This was partly explained by a 17% increase in PSI content in the plants lacking PSI-N.									111	2	0	0	107	0	119			0960-7412			WOS:000079755400010	10230065

About a case								INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SURGERY CASE REPORTS				77				719	725		10.1016/j.ijscr.2020.11.020				2020	2020	OBJECTIVE: To describe the form of severe clinical presentation of SARS-COV-2 infection in the early phase, also the timely treatment of COVID-19 pneumonia in postoperative pulmonary lobectomy.METHOD: Case report where the data were extracted from the clinical history and is in accordance with the SCARE 2018 criteria.DESCRIPTION OF THE CASE: A 36-year-old man, with no significant history, who presented fever and mucopurulent expectoration of 1 month of evolution, received antibiotics for 4 weeks without response to treatment. Chest tomography shows cystic image with heterogeneous content in the left lower lobe. We decided to opt for surgery, previously 1 PCR in RT and 7 serological tests for COVID-19 were performed, the result of which was non-reactive. In the postoperative period, the patient developed fever and dyspnea on mild exertion, so a new serological test for COVID-19 was performed: IgM/IgG reactive, in addition chest tomography showed both lungs with "cracy paving" pattern.DISCUSSION: The serological tests did not contribute to a timely diagnosis of COVID-19 and generated confusion. We used oxygen therapy, broad spectrum antibiotics since the diagnosis of COVID-19. Likewise, respiratory physiotherapy was intensified even after discharge.CONCLUSION: The early diagnosis and use of antibiotics at doses of sepsis, associated with corticosteroid pulses and respiratory physiotherapy improve COVID-19 pneumonia in postoperative lung surgery.

Meanwhile, carbonaceous electrode materials, which are most commonly used in CDI systems, have poor long-term stability due to unfavorable interactions with oxygen in saline water. Herein, rapid and vigorous inversion of surface charges in heteroatom-doped carbon electrodes, which leads to a robust operation of CDI with high desalination capacity, is reported for the first time. By carbonization of coffee wastes, nitrogen- and sulfur-codoped activated carbon with hierarchical micro/mesopores are prepared in an environmentally-friendly manner, and this carbon results in a significantly higher inverted capacity than that of various activated carbon counterparts in long-term CDI operations, without any sign of drop in performance. Investigations on the changes in physicochemical properties of the electrodes during the inversion disclose the favorable roles of nitrogen and sulfur dopants, which can be summarized as enlarging the difference between the surface charges of the two electrodes by chemical interactions with oxygen in the anode and carbon in the cathode.									34	0	0	0	8	0	34			1616-301X	1616-3028		WOS:000504710600001

The films have undergone postdeposition heat treatments in air at 250 and 290 degrees C for different times, ranging from 30 min to 14 h. The properties of as-deposited and heated films have been investigated by different techniques in order to determine the effects of heat treatments on the film properties. Fourier transform infrared analysis and UV-visible optical absorption analysis point out a gradual evolution of the film structure from a mixture of alpha and beta polymorphs to the only beta polymorph in the sample heated at 290 degrees C for 14 h. A pronounced decrease of carbon and nitrogen atomic percentages against an oxygen increase in the heated films are shown by ion beam analyses ( Rutherford backscattering spectrometry and nuclear reaction analysis) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). X-ray absorption spectroscopy and XPS indicate that part of the copper phthalocyanine molecules decompose during heat treatments and the formation of copper oxide takes place. The replacement of copper phthalocyanine by copper oxide in the heated films accounts for the change of their surface electrical conductance and of their electrical response to NO2.									13	0	0	0	0	0	13			0897-4756			WOS:000239758300040

The kinetic surface mechanisms take into account the nucleation phase process, the physisorption of reactive TEOS fragments, and the migration process. The main process contributing to the SiO2 growth is the formation of the oxygen bridge between two surface silicon sites. The simulations show the role of the substrate energy and the percentage of the nucleation center on the nucleation phase evolution. Good adhesion is obtained for a high surface energy of the substrate. A high surface energy increases the mobility of the reactive species on the surface substrate by the reduction of the desorption process in the early stage. On the other hand, the increase of the oxidation probability leads to the decrease of the mobility of physisorbed species on the film surface and, consequently, to increased root-mean-square roughness of the deposited film.

J	RAVEN, JA								PLANT-RESPONSES TO HIGH O-2 CONCENTRATIONS - RELEVANCE TO PREVIOUS HIGH O-2 EPISODES								GLOBAL AND PLANETARY CHANGE				97	1-2			19	38						DEC 1991	1991	Exposure to the approximately 43 kPa O2 thought to correspond to the highest O2 partial pressure in the Phanerozoic rather than the 21 kPa in the present atmosphere deleteriously affects extant C3 land plants by increasing (1) the O2 inhibition (competitive with CO2) of the carboxylating enzyme ribulose 1,5 bisphosphate carboxylase-oxygenase, (2) the O2 inactivation of nitrogenase in symbiotic N2-fixers, and (3) the generation of reactive oxygen species which can damage nucleic acids, proteins, lipids and other cell constituents. Exposure of these plants to O2 levels approximating a high O2 episode inhibits growth via inhibition of ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase and, possibly, by unrepaired damage caused by reactive oxygen species and by the resource diversion related to increasing the capacity of mechanisms reducing the level of reactive oxygen species and to repairing the damage caused by these species. Longer term effects (e.g. increased level of mutations in a population) have not been explored.Natural exposure of all or part of extant plants to O2 levels in excess of 43 kPa occurs in the light in most plants other than C3 land plants due to photosynthetic O2 evolution with restricted diffusion to a medium with normal O2 levels attendant on the maintenance of high CO2 concentrations around ribulose 1,5 bisphospbate carboxylase. While the high O2 levels seem to be restricted where possible to non-meristematic regions of multicellular plants, these plants which have high internal O2 levels do not seem to be disadvantaged relative to C3 land plants.The high O2 concentrations proposed for periods in the Phanerozoic are tolerated, as intracellular O2 levels, in some cells of a substantial fraction of extant phototrophs, and many can tolerate substantially higher levels.

In this study, smooth 2D amorphous tin disulfide (SnS2) films were fabricated by atomic layer deposition (ALD), and applied for the first time to photoelectrochemical water splitting. The optimal stable photocurrent density of the 50-nm-thick amorphous SnS2 film fabricated at 140 degrees C was 51.5 mu A/cm(2) at an oxygen evolution reaction (0.8 V vs. saturated calomel electrode (SCE)). This value is better than those of most polycrystalline SnS2 films reported in recent years. These results are attributed mainly to adjustable optical band gap in the range of 2.80 to 2.52 eV, precise control of the film thickness at the nanoscale, and the close contact between the prepared SnS2 film and substrate. Subsequently, the photoelectron separation mechanisms of the amorphous, monocrystalline, and polycrystalline SnS2 films are discussed. Considering above advantages, the ALD amorphous SnS2 film can be designed and fabricated according to the application requirements.									12	0	0	0	0	0	12				2079-4991		WOS:000483604500098	31357724	
J	Elena Saenz, Maria; Dario Di Marzio, Walter; Luis Alberdi, Jose								Assessment of Cyfluthrin commercial formulation on growth, photosynthesis and catalase activity of green algae								PESTICIDE BIOCHEMISTRY AND PHYSIOLOGY				104	1			50	57		10.1016/j.pestbp.2012.07.001				SEP 2012	2012	Aquatic environments of the pampasic region of Argentina are severely affected by agricultural contamination due to an increase in a glyphosate tolerant transgenic variety of soybean crops. The present study is aimed to determine the effects of a commonly used Cyfluthrin commercial formulation (CCF) on growth, some physiological and biochemical parameter of four species of green algae. Significant inhibition of algal growth was observed from 0.1 mg Cyf/l. 96 h IC50 were between 0.92 and 4.85 mg Cyf/l. CCF caused algicidal effects. Photosynthesis was stimulated by 50% in Scenedesmus quadricauda cultures exposed to the lowest concentration (hormesis). Algal photosynthesis inhibition was observed at higher concentrations with IC50 values between 1.7 and 8.9 mg Cyf/l. Similar toxicity endpoints were found as a consequence of applying the traditional methodology of short-term chronic toxicity test of 96 h of exposition and the methodology developed using the Clark type photosynthetic oxygen evolution method. CAT activity was significantly increased between 23% and 33% considering the four species, at a lower concentration than those affecting algal growth and photosynthesis, indicating a potential biomarker. Taking into account that the extent of the soybean crops in the region is about fourteen million hectares, the improvement and extension of environmental tools for early detection of the action of pesticides on this essential group of organisms are discussed.

The delta O-18 and delta C-13 values of the veins overlap those of the host schistes lustres, and the delta O-18 values of the veins are much higher than those of other rocks on Corsica. These data suggest that the vein-forming fluids were derived from the schistes lustres. Fluids were probably generated by reactions that broke down carpholite, lawsonite, chlorite and white mica at 300-350 degreesC during decompression between c. 1400 and 800 MPa. However, the delta O-18 values of the veins are locally several per mil higher than expected given those of their host rocks. The magnitude of oxygen isotope disequilibrium between the veins and the host rock is inversely proportional to the delta O-18 value of the host rock. Additionally, calcite in some schists is in isotopic equilibrium with calcite in adjacent veins, but not with the silicate fraction of the schists. Locally, the schists are calcite bearing only within 1-20 cm of the veins. The vein-forming fluids may have been preferentially derived from calcite-bearing, high-delta O-18 rocks that are common within the schistes lustres and that locally contain abundant (>15%) veins. If the fluids were unable to completely isotopically equilibrate with the rocks, due to relatively rapid flow at moderate temperatures or being confined to fractures, they could form veins with higher delta O-18 values than those of the surrounding rocks. Alteration of the host rocks was probably inhibited by isolation of the fluid in 'quartz-armoured' veins. Overall, the veins represent a metre- to hectometre-scale fluid-flow system confined to within the schistes lustres unit, with little input from external sources. This fluid-flow system is one of several that operated in the western Alps during exhumation following high-pressure metamorphism.									36	0	0	0	0	0	36			0263-4929	1525-1314		WOS:000165158500001

The flame retardation of the composites has been studied by the limited oxygen index (LOI) and UL-94 methods, and the thermal decomposition by the thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). The changes of their properties of the composites before and after the Gamma irradiation are compared. The synergistic effect in the flame retardation between MALDH and MRP in EVA has been found. The EVA/MALDH/MRP composites after the irradiation crosslinking result in a great increase in the Vicat softening point. The LOI value, the mechanical properties and thermal stability are also improved for the composites irradiated by a suitable irradiation dose. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

In particular, the typical layered MoS2 has attracted interest as a low-cost alternative to platinum in the photocatalytic hydrogen evolution system. However, theoretical studies have suggested that the activity of the MoS2 co-catalyst arises only at the S sites on the edges of grains, and not on the basal planes. In this respect, the doping of a foreign metal into the MoS2 system is an interesting method for boosting the hydrogen production rate by increasing the conductivity and number of active sites. Herein, simple methods are used to decorate CdS nanorods with earth-abundant, few-layered zinc-doped MoS2 nanosheets (Zn-MoS2/CdS), and the so-obtained Zn-MoS2/CdS composite is used for the photocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction under solar irradiation in the presence of lactic acid as a hole scavenger. Thus, the catalyst is shown to provide significant hydrogen generation activity, along with excellent and continuous photo stability for more than 60 h under optimal conditions. Moreover, the hydrogen evolution rate of the Zn-MoS2/CdS composite is up to similar to 75-fold greater than that of the pure CdS. The loading of Zn-MoS2 is shown to increase the synergistic effects of the photocatalyst due to the effective separation of charge carriers, extensive exposure of catalytic sites, and high dispersion of the few-layered Zn-MoS2. In addition, the stability of the optimized material is enhanced by the doping of Zn metal into the MoS2. To the best of our knowledge, the hydrogen evolution activity of the as-prepared composite is the highest ever reported for the CdS and single metal-doped MoS2-based catalysts. Hence, this type of Zn-MoS2/CdS composite is strongly believed to have great potential as a low-cost, highly-efficient, noble-metal free catalyst for the photocatalytic reduction of water.

There is a diverse family of Rboh genes in different plants, mediated a multiplicity of physiological functions. However, there have been limited reports on the characterization of Rboh gene family in soybean. In the present study, seventeen GmRboh genes were identified from the whole-genome sequence of soybean, and these proteins were phylogenetically clustered into five distance subgroups. Comprehensive expression profile analysis provided insights into the soybean-specific functional divergence among members of the Rboh gene family. The expressions patterns of GmRboh genes under biotic/abiotic stress were evaluated based on global gene expression tools and qRT-PCR analysis, and the 'hotspot' genes for development and stress responses were identified. Some duplicate genes were partially redundant, while others showed functional diversity, suggesting the occurrence of sub-functionalization during subsequent evolution. At last, applying diphenylene iodonium (DPI), a classical NADPH oxidase inhibitor, significantly reduced ROS accumulation in soybean roots under abiotic stress, and also influenced the expression of GmRboh genes. Taken together, our results provided a good reference for further functional characterization analysis of members of the Rboh genes in soybean.									7	0	0	0	5	0	7			0098-8472	1873-7307		WOS:000466823000030

For example,UCP2 has the ability to inhibit the excessive generation of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species in certain cells,such as immune cells. In our research,we designed primers for RTPCR, and obtained the core sequence in the cDNA of UCP2 from Tupaia belangeri. This core sequence was 750 bp,encoding 248 amino acids. After structure-function analysis,we found that the fragment composed of these amino acids possessed two mitochondrial carrier protein motifs,five potential transmembrane alpha-helix domains, one purine-nucleotide binding domain ( PNBD) and three UCP-specific sequences.

Here, a facilein situnucleation strategy was used to construct ultrafine NiFe-LDH nanosheets monodispersed on a carbon black (CB) substrate. Notably, this work displayed the interfacial impact of combining CB with NiFe-LDHs on electrocatalyst activation. Interestingly, the optimized NiFe-LDHs/CB composite displays a fast activation rate and excellent water oxidation performance on a glassy-carbon electrode (an overpotential of 226 mV at 10 mA cm(-2); a Tafel slope of 57 mV dec(-1)). This is due to the high active area, low impedance and ultra-high active metal atom utilization rate, accelerating charge transfer at the interface during the activation process. More importantly, this work highlights the interfacial charge transfer effect during the activation process and supplies clues for designing electrocatalysts.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			1477-9226	1477-9234		WOS:000542716300016	32432241

Neurodevelopmental disease is the most serious disorder of childhood, affecting the quality of life of children and their families. Therefore, the monitoring and optimization of nerve damage treatments are important. The factors contributing to neurodevelopmental disease are primarily related to preoperative, intraoperative, postoperative, genetic, and environmental causes, with intraoperative causes being the most influential. Nevertheless, few studies have examined these factors, particularly the influencing factors during early postoperative care. Children with congenital heart disease may experience brain damage during early heart intensive care due to unstable haemodynamics and total body oxygen transfer, particularly early postoperative inflammatory reactions in the brain, blood glucose levels, and other factors that potentially influence long-term neural development. This study analyses the forms of structural and functional brain damage in the early postoperative period, along with the recent evolution of research on its contributing factors.									7	0	0	0	1	0	7			0753-3322	1950-6007		WOS:000593702700004	33254442

The maximum transient concentration of the primary radical pair is about five times larger and its decay is about seven times slower with doubly reduced compared with singly reduced Q(A). The possible biological significance of these differences is discussed. On the basis of a simple reversible reaction scheme, the measured apparent rate constants and relative amplitudes allow determination of sets of molecular rate constants and energetic parameters for primary reactions in the reaction centers with doubly reduced Q(A) as well as with oxidized or singly reduced Q(A). The standard free energy difference DeltaG degrees between the charge-separated slate P680(+)Pheo(-) and the equilibrated excited state (Chl(N)P680)* was found to be similar when Q(A) was oxidized or doubly reduced before the flash (similar to -50 meV). In contrast, single reduction of Q(A) led to a large change in DeltaG degrees (similar to-+40 meV), demonstrating the importance of electrostatic interaction between the charge on Q(A) and the primary radical pair, and providing direct evidence that the doubly reduced Q(A) is an electrically neutral species, i.e., is doubly protonated. A comparison of the molecular rate constants shows that the rate of charge recombination is much more sensitive to the change in DeltaG degrees than the rate of primary charge separation.									32	0	2	0	24	1	33			0006-3495			WOS:000167797800001	11259277

The CEMP-no stars are long-lived small mass stars presenting a very low iron content and overabundances of carbon with no sign or only very weak signs of s- or r-elements. Although the origin of this abundance pattern is still a matter of debate, it was very likely inherited from a previous massive star, which we call the source star.Aims. We rely on a recent classification of CEMP-no stars arguing that some of them are made of a material processed by hydrogen burning that was enriched in products of helium burning during the nuclear life of the source star. We examine the possibility of forming CEMP-no stars with this material.Methods. We study the nucleosynthesis of the CNO cycle and the Ne-Na Mg-Al chains in a hydrogen burning single zone while injecting the helium burning products C-12, O-16, Ne-22, and Mg-26. We investigate the impact of changing density, temperature and the injection rate. The nuclear reaction rates involving the creation and destruction of Al-27 are also examined.Results. N-14, Na-23, Mg-24, and Al-27 are formed when injecting C-12, O-16, Ne-22, and Mg-26 in the hydrogen burning zone. The C-12/C-13 ratio is constant under various conditions in the hydrogen burning zone. The predicted [Al/Fe] ratio varies up to similar to 2 dex depending on the prescription used for the reaction rates involving Al-27.Conclusions. The experiments we carried out support the view that some CEMP-no stars are made of a material processed by hydrogen burning that comes from a massive star experiencing mild to strong rotational mixing. During its burning, this material was likely enriched in helium burning products. No material coming from the carbon-oxygen rich core of the source star should be added to form the daughter star, otherwise the C-12/C-13 ratio would be largely above the observed range of values.									22	0	0	0	0	0	22			0004-6361	1432-0746		WOS:000385820100038		
J	Vashishta, P; Kalia, RK; Nakano, A								Multimillion atom simulations of dynamics of oxidation of an aluminum nanoparticle and nanoindentation on ceramics								JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY B				110	8			3727	3733		10.1021/jp0556153				MAR 2 2006	2006	We have developed a first-principles-based hierarchical simulation framework, which seamlessly integrates (1) a quantum mechanical description based on the density functional theory (DFT), (2) multilevel molecular dynamics (MD) simulations based on a reactive force field (ReaxFF) that describes chemical reactions and polarization, a nonreactive force field that employs dynamic atomic charges, and an effective force field (EFF), and (3) an atomistically informed continuum model to reach macroscopic length scales. For scalable hierarchical simulations, we have developed parallel linear-scaling algorithms for (1) DFT calculation based on a divide-and-conquer algorithm on adaptive multigrids, (2) chemically reactive MD based on a fast ReaxFF (F-ReaxFF) algorithm, and (3) EFF-MD based on a space-time multiresolution MD (MRMD) algorithm. On 1920 Intel Itanium2 processors, we have demonstrated 1.4 million atom (0.12 trillion grid points) DFT, 0.56 billion atom F-ReaxFF, and 18.9 billion atom MRMD calculations, with parallel efficiency as high as 0.953. Through the use of these algorithms, multimillion atom MD simulations have been performed to study the oxidation of an aluminum nanoparticle. Structural and dynamic correlations in the oxide region are calculated as well as the evolution of charges, surface oxide thickness, diffusivities of atoms, and local stresses. In the microcanonical ensemble, the oxidizing reaction becomes explosive in both molecular and atomic oxygen environments, due to the enormous energy release associated with Al-O bonding. In the canonical ensemble, an amorphous oxide layer of a thickness of similar to 40 angstrom is formed after 466 ps, in good agreement with experiments. Simulation,; have been performed to study nanoindentation on crystalline, amorphous, and nanocrystalline silicon nitride and silicon carbide. Simulation on nanocrystalline silicon carbide reveals unusual deformation mechanisms in brittle nanophase materials, due to coexistence of brittle grains and soft amorphous-like grain boundary phases. Simulations predict a crossover from intergranular continuous deformation to intragrain discrete deformation at a critical indentation depth.									50	0	0	0	1	1	50			1520-6106	1520-5207		WOS:000235944300034	16494430

The best electrochemical performance was obtained using dimensional stable anode (DSA) and CFF cathode due to the higher capacity for electro-generation of H2O2 by selective two-electron oxygen reduction. The CFF/DSA electrolysis system realized 78.2% COD removal and complete decolorization over a wide pH range. The efficacy of RRX-3B degradation was found to be dependent on the nature of carbonaceous materials. Electrochemical measurements showed that CFF possessed higher electrochemical surface area and hydrogen evolution reaction over-potential. Furthermore, the intrinsic graphitic N in CFF was proved to be catalytic active site by DFT calculations. Reactive Red X-3B degradation intermediates with benzene structures and carboxylic acids via hydroxylation in RRX-3B oxidation were identified by GC-MS. It was found that S/Cl/N-containing groups in RRX-3B molecule were mineralized to SO42-, NO3- and Cl- ions in the electrolysis.									7	1	0	0	4	0	8			0301-4797	1095-8630		WOS:000613569300007	33234317

With increasing the content of Sr in the sample, the MOx shape will change from NbO4 octahedra to NbO4 tetrahedra, which is confirmed by the Raman scattering spectra. With increasing the content of NbO4 in the sample, the lattice parameter increases, optical band gap becomes larger, and the surface changes to be more active for oxygen adsorption, resulting in a higher photocatalytic activity.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			1110-662X	1687-529X		WOS:000444961700001

High pressure in that direction has shown great potential to tune the performance of nanophosphors. However, very little attention has been paid on tuning the optical properties of technologically important La2Zr2O7 (LZO) pyrochlore nanoparticles (NPs) and its doped counterpart La2Zr2O7:Eu3+ (LZOE) NPs under elevated pressure. Equally little effort has been given on local structure evolution of Eu3+ ion as a function of pressure in the doped LZOE NPs. Here in this work, LZO depicted strong oxygen vacancy blue emission under ambient and up to 5.54 GPa pressure, and beyond that, there is an evolution of pressure induced green and red photoluminescence (PL) band. This is projected in color tuning from blue -> green -> white in low-intermediate-high pressure regime. Emergence of unusual visible PL band at elevated pressure is ascribed to structural phase transition from ordered pyrochlore to cotuunite structure which endows large disordering in the LZO structure as well as induces lattice distortion of ZrO6 octahedra. High-pressure PL excitation spectra of the LZOE NPs throw interesting results wherein the charge transfer band is retained in ordered pyrochlore and disappears in high pressure cotuunite phase. As the pressure is raised, the asymmetry ratio of the LZOE NPs exhibits monotonic decrease up to similar to 19.77 GPa and saturation beyond that, implying a high local symmetry around Eu3+ ions from high pressure compression. This work is a way forward in the area of understanding structure-property correlation, pressure induced color tunability and modulating local structure of lanthanide dopant in the area of luminescent NPs.

In this paper, we quantified the metabolic response, in terms of metabolic flux redistribution, of a lysine-overproducing strain of Corynebacterium glutamicum grown under continuous culture, to gradually increasing osmolality. Oxygen and carbon dioxide evolution rates, and the changes in concentration of extracellular, as well as intracellular, metabolites were measured throughout the osmotic gradient. The metabolic fluxes were estimated from these measurements and from the mass balance constraints at each metabolite-node of the assumed metabolic reaction network. Our results show that formation rates of compatible solutes trehalose first and proline at a later stage of the gradient increased with osmotic stress to equilibrate the external osmotic pressure. Estimated flux distributions indicate that the observed increase in the glucose specific uptake rate with osmotic stress is channeled through the main energy generating pathways-glycolysis and the tricarboxylic acid cycle-while the flux through the pentose phosphate pathway remains constant throughout the gradient. This results in a significant increase in the net specific ATP production rate, which may possibly be used to support the higher energy requirements required for cellular maintenance at high osmolalities. Finally, nodal analysis confirmed that the PEP/pyruvate node is essentially rigid and that the glucose-6-phosphate, oxaloacetate and aketoglutarate nodes are flexible and therefore adaptable to changes in osmotic pressure in C. glutainicum.									53	4	0	0	49	0	60			0175-7598			WOS:000180876800007	12536254	
J	Reniers, F; Rooryck, V; Pace, S; Buess-Herman, C								UHV-liquid cell transfer system for Auger electron spectroscopy on electrodes								SURFACE AND INTERFACE ANALYSIS				34	1			623	627		10.1002/sia.1374				AUG 2002	2002	Many chemical reactions take place at the liquid/solid interface that are responsible for dramatic environmental, industrial and economic problems. For a long time, these reactions have been studied by conventional electrochemical techniques and the influence of most of the macroscopic parameters involved in the reaction (solution pH and composition, redox potential, etc.) are known for many systems. The resulting oxidized surface is often analysed by XPS and AES, but the measurements are performed after air exposure and thus after surface contamination or post-oxidation. Most of the time, no direct information on the surface composition at the liquid/solid interface is available because of the lack of in situ available techniques for chemical analysis.In order to combine the intrinsic advantage of electrochemical techniques (superior for the study of the redox reactions in solution) and the power of surface analysis techniques such as XPS and AES used under ultrahigh vacuum (UHV), we have designed, built and validated an original versatile UHV-electrochemical cell transfer system. This system allows the preparation of a clean electrode surface under UHV and its characterization by low-energy electron diffraction and AES before its transfer to an electrochemical cell under a controlled atmosphere (no oxygen, no contamination). The study of model electrochemical reactions can take place and is followed by transfer of the electrode back to the UHV chamber for surface analysis by AES, without exposure to air. The transfer procedure takes 4 min.Model systems were used to validate the system:(1) Bromide ions were electrochemically adsorbed on gold at various electrode potentials, inducing different surface compositions. Evolution of the Br content on the surface as a function of the electrode potential, estimated after transfer by AES, is in good agreement with the Br surface excess extracted from the electrochemical data, indicating that the transfer process induces no significant alteration of the surface, despite the weak bonding of bromide on gold and the brutal transfer from liquid to UHV. Results were compared with the literature.(2) Aluminium was taken as a standard to study the residual oxidation due to the composition of the atmosphere during the transfer process. The residual contamination (carbon) induced by the transfer process was also analysed. Carbon-free transfer procedures were established.In conclusion, such a transfer system combines the unique advantages of electrochemical methods to study corrosion processes with the power of a UHV technique such as AES.

B	Pessoa, R.S.; Toneli, D.; Roberto, M.; Petraconi, G.; Maciel, H.S.								Electron Energy Distribution Function measurements in a low pressure expanding plasma jet								2013 Abstracts IEEE International Conference on Plasma Science (ICOPS)								1 pp.	1 pp.		10.1109/PLASMA.2013.6633366				2013	2013	Summary form only given. Streaming plasmas operating at low pressures can be viewed as high-current density, fully space-charge-compensated and charged particles (electrons, ions) sources. Because of these features, some applications as thin-film deposition, etching, ion nitriding and spectroscopic light sources are based on this discharge type. For a given application, it is desirable to control both the absolute and relative concentration of the active species (neutral particles and ions) in order to establish the best process conditions. The electron energy distribution function (EEDF) is closely associated with the rates of the major elementary processes, particle and power balance in the discharge, and it determines the global stability and operational properties of the plasma. Control of the EEDF is, thus, one of the major challenges in the application of chemically active plasmas in the microelectronic and other industries. Prediction of the evolution of the EEDF is crucial for fine-tuning the complex plasma. In this study, we report on the existence of two electron temperature populations in a low pressure plasma jet through the investigation of the spatial evolution of EEDF measured by a single Langmuir probe. Experiments have been done in a constrictive plasma source where the plasma jet is generated and operated with argon, oxygen and its mixtures. The discharge was generated by a dc power supply (3500V, 0.5A) and the applied power was varied in the range of 10 to 50 W. In all experiments the total pressure was fixed at 4 mTorr. A mobile single Langmuir probe was mounted on the discharge axis in order to study the spatial evolution of EEDF. The EEDF was determined using the second derivative of the Langmuir probe current-voltage characteristic on the Druyvesteyn method. The second derivative was filtered using the least-squares fitting method. The results show that inert plus reactive gas mixing can change the EEDF from a Maxwellian to a `two-temperature' structure in low pressure plasma jet discharge. This result suggests the existence of two groups of electrons: low and high energy. Moreover, a detailed experimental investigation of the spatial evolution of EEDF with different gases indicated the deflection of the non-Maxwellian plasma in the beginning of the plasma jet for Maxwellian plasma when the probe is moved to longer distances.					2013 IEEE 40th International Conference on Plasma Sciences (ICOPS)2013 IEEE 40th International Conference on Plasma Sciences (ICOPS)	16-21 June 201316-21 June 2013		San Francisco, CA, USASan Francisco, CA, USA	0	0	0		0	0	0					978-1-4673-5171-3	INSPEC:13845689

We visualized ROS generation in repair cells of Giriffthsia monilis using DCFH-DA staining and examined the expression of the genes involved in wound healing using quantitative PCR. Repair cells elongate along the H2O2 gradient, meet at each other's tips where the H2O2 concentration is highest, and undergo somatic fusion. No wound response occurred with ascorbic acid treatment. Conversely, H2O2 treatment induced many repair cells, leading to multiple somatic cell fusions. Diphenylene iodonium (DPI) or caffeine treatment reversibly inhibited ROS production in repair cells and blocked the progression of the wound response suggesting that ROS and calcium signaling are involved in the process. Four G. monilis homologues of NADPH-oxidase (GmRBOHs) were identified. The expression of GmRBOHs was upregulated upon injury, peaking 1 h post injury, and decreasing to initial levels when repair cells began to elongate. Our results suggest that ROS generated upon cell injury activates Ca2+ channels and upregulates the expression of GmRBOHs, and that H2O2 generated from repair cells mediates induced repair cell elongation leading to somatic cell fusion and filament repair.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0				2073-4409		WOS:000822159400001	35805208

Since it was shown that heavy metals may cause deficiencies of essential nutrients in plants the potential reversal of cadmium toxicity by increased N nutrition was investigated. The effects on photosynthesis of low Cd (0, 0.5, 2 or 5 mmol m(-3)) combined with three N treatments (2, 7.5 or 10 mol m(-3)) were examined in young sunflower plants. Chlorophyll fluorescence quenching parameters were determined at ambient CO2 and at 100 or 800 mu mol quanta m(-2) s(-1). The vitality index (R-fd) decreased approx. three-times in response to 5 mmol m(-3) Cd, at 2 and 10 mol m(-3) N. The maximum photochemical efficiency of PSII reaction centres (F-v/F-m) was not influenced by Cd or N treatment. The highest Cd concentration decreased quantum efficiency of PSII electron transport (Phi(II)) by 30 %, at 2 and 10 mol m(-3) N, mostly due to increased closure of PSII reaction centres (q(p)). Photosynthetic oxygen evolution rates at saturating CO2 were decreased in plants treated with 5 mmol m(-3) Cd, at all N concentrations. The results indicate that Cd treatment affected the ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate (RuBP) regeneration capacity of the Calvin cycle more than other processes. At the same time, the amounts of soluble and ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (Rubisco) protein increased with Cd treatment. Decreased photosynthesis, but substantially increased Rubisco content, in sunflower leaves under Cd stress indicate that a significant amount of Rubisco protein is not active in photosynthesis and could have another function. It is shown that optimal nitrogen nutrition decreases the inhibitory effects of Cd in young sunflower plants.

Electrodes were prepared by coating Pt-, Ni-, Co-oxides on graphite substrate using electrodeless deposition method and characterized with SEM, EDS, XRD, XPS and cyclic voltammetry. Results showed that the molar ratio of Ni- and Co-oxides on graphite surface influenced surface structure and in-situ chlorine generation capacity. Pt0.01Ni0.24Co0.75 electrode exhibited a unique surface structure and the highest in-situ chlorine generation capability. The Pt0.01Ni0.24Co0.75-G electrode exhibited highly porous 3D structure and high oxygen deficit, which significantly promoted the formation of M-Cl- binding on electrode surface and enhanced chlorine generation. The onset of chlorine evolution potential was lower than that of oxygen on Pt0.01Ni0.24Co0.75-G electrode. Moreover, the transfer coefficient of chloride oxidation was smaller than that of water oxidation, which would enhance chloride oxidation current efficiency. The in-situ chlorine generation capability increased with NaCl concentration. The kinetics of chlorine generation was well described by the Langmuir-Hinsheldwood mechanism. The in-situ disinfection rate decreased with the increase in initial E. coli density. A 7.5-log disinfection was achieved in 15 min in the presence of 0.01 M NaCl under 5 mA/cm(2) current density at room temperature. The lipid peroxide, morphology changes and destruction of E. coli cell membrane were observed in the in-situ disinfection process, indicating that reactive species such as chlorine radical in addition to free chlorine played the main role of in-situ disinfection.									2	0	0	0	1	0	2			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000728669200005

Globin X (GbX) is a protein found in fish, amphibians, and reptiles that diverged from a common ancestor of mammalian hemoglobins and myoglobins. Like mammalian neuroglobin, GbX was first designated as a neuronal globin in fish and exhibits six-coordinate heme geometry, suggesting a role in intracellular electron transfer reactions rather than oxygen binding. Here, we report that GbX to our knowledge is the first six-coordinate globin and the first globin protein apart from hemoglobin, found in vertebrate RBCs. GbX is present in fish erythrocytes and exhibits a nitrite reduction rate up to 200-fold faster than human hemoglobin and up to 50-fold higher than neuroglobin or cytoglobin. Deoxygenated GbX reduces nitrite to form nitric oxide (NO) and potently inhibits platelet activation in vitro, to a greater extent than hemoglobin. Fish RBCs also reduce nitrite to NO and inhibit platelet activation to a greater extent than human RBCs, whereas GbX knockdown inhibits this nitrite-dependent NO signaling. The description of a novel, six-coordinate globin in RBCs with dominant electron transfer and nitrite reduction functionality provides new insights into the evolved signaling properties of ancestral heme-globins.									36	1	0	0	34	0	37			0027-8424			WOS:000380346200061	27407144

Platform-wide phosphorite precipitation requires special oceanographic and geochemical conditions, thus the origin of the Niutitang phosphorite nodules may provide valuable information about the ocean chemistry in the Early Cambrian. In this study, we measured sulfur and oxygen isotopic compositions of sulfate extracted from phosphorite nodules collected from the basal Niutitang Formation. Phosphorite associated sulfate (PAS) is a trace amount of sulfate that incorporates into crystal lattice during phosphorite precipitation, accordingly PAS records the geochemical signals during phosphorite nodule formation. Sulfur isotopic composition of PAS (delta S-34(PAS)) ranges from -1.16%0 to +24.48%0 (mean=+8.19%0, n=11), and oxygen isotopic value (delta O-18(PAS)) varies between -5.3%0 and +26.3%0 (mean=1-7.0%0, n=8). Most phosphorite nodules have low delta S-34(PAS) and low delta O-18(PAS) values, suggesting PAS mainly derived from anaerobic oxidation of H2S within suboxic sediment porewater. We propose that phosphate was delivered to the Yangtze Platform by a series of upwelling events, and was scavenged from seawater with the precipitation of FeOOH. The absorbed phosphate was released into suboxic porewater by the reduction of FeOOH at the oxic-suboxic redox boundary in sediments, and phosphorite nodule precipitated by the reaction of phosphate with Ca2+ diffused from the overlying seawater. The platform-wide deposition of phosphorite nodules in the basal Niutitang Formation implies the bottom water might be suboxic or even oxic, at least sporadically, in Early Cambrian. We speculate that the intensified ocean circulation as evident with frequent occurrences of upwelling events might be the primary reason for the episodic oxidation of the Yangtze Platform in Early Cambrian.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			1674-487X	1867-111X		WOS:000373423300002

APAM and WO3 were inserted into g-C3N4 nanosheet. The carbon, thin planar structure and WO3 with oxygen vacancies result in fast charge transfer, high quantum efficiency and strong driving force for photocatalytic reaction. Consequently, as-prepared C-W/N ternary composite photocatalyst exhibited significantly enhanced photocatalytic performance for tetracycline (TC) degradation under visible light compared to pure g-C3N4, WO3 and other binary composites. Moreover, the material showed high stability and reusability in cyclic TC degradation. The principal intermediate products over C-W/N photocatalyst were revealed by HPLC-MS analysis. Corresponding degradation pathway of TC was also presented in this work. According to the trapping experiments, analysis of electron spin resource (ESR) and band gap, possible charge transfer pathways of C-W/N are proposed and discussed in detail. Based on the results, carbon derived from APAM works not only as electron mediator but also as acceptor for photocatalytic degradation reaction. It is a promising way to further modulate heterojunction for varies applications.									111	9	0	0	28	0	113			0304-3894	1873-3336		WOS:000532829200029	32120212

Previous studies have found pyrogenic carbon can mediate the reductive degradation of organic pollutants under anoxic sulfide conditions; however, the scenario under oxic sulfide conditions has rarely been reported. In this study, we found that pyrogenic carbon can mediate hydroxyl radicals ((OH)-O-center dot) generation from sulfide oxidation under dark oxic conditions. The accumulated (OH)-O-center dot ranged from 2.07 to 101.90 mu M in the presence of 5 mM Na2S and 100 mg L-1 pyrogenic carbon at pH 7.0 within 240 min. The Raman spectra and electrochemical cell experiments revealed that the carbon defects were the possible chemisorption sites for oxygen, while the graphite crystallites were responsible for the electron transfer from sulfide to O-2 to generate H2O2 and (OH)-O-center dot. Quenching experiments and degradation product identification showed that As(III) and sulfanilamide can be oxidized by the generated (OH)-O-center dot. This research provides a new insight into the important role of pyrogenic carbon in redox reactions and dark (OH)-O-center dot production.									13	0	0	0	10	0	13			0013-936X	1520-5851		WOS:000648515400040	33819016

Doping modification as well as constructing two-dimensional layered structure of g-C3N4 are widely used as effective strategies to improve photocatalytic performance. However, the present synthesis methods still need to improve. In this work, we report a facile hydrogen peroxide assisted hydrothermal approach to synthesize layered oxygen-doped g-C3N4 for photocatalytic degradation of RhB. The obtained samples were investigated in detail by a series of characterization methods. Compared with bulk g-C3N4, the as-prepared few-layer oxygen-doped g-C3N4 sample has modulated CB and VB potentials, lower band gap energy, larger specific surface area, and higher separation efficiency of charge carriers. The photocatalytic RhB degradation constant over few-layer oxygen-doped g-C3N4 is approximately 5-fold higher than that of bulk g-C3N4 counterpart. Finally, an enhanced photocatalytic RhB degradation mechanism was proposed. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.									20	0	0	0	1	0	20			0925-8388	1873-4669		WOS:000638274800046		
J	Enescu, Mironel; Nagy, Kathryn L.; Manceau, Alain								Nucleation of mercury sulfide by dealkylation								SCIENTIFIC REPORTS				6						39359	10.1038/srep39359				DEC 19 2016	2016	Metal sulfide minerals are assumed to form naturally at ambient conditions via reaction of a metallic element with (poly) sulfide ions, usually produced by microbes in oxygen-depleted environments. Recently, the formation of mercury sulfide (beta-HgS) directly from linear Hg(II)-thiolate complexes (Hg(SR)(2)) in natural organic matter and in cysteine solutions was demonstrated under aerated conditions. Here, a detailed description of this non-sulfidic reaction is provided by computations at a high level of molecular-orbital theory. The HgS stoichiometry is obtained through the cleavage of the S-C bond in one thiolate, transfer of the resulting alkyl group (R') to another thiolate, and subsequent elimination of a sulfur atom from the second thiolate as a thioether (RSR'). Repetition of this mechanism leads to the formation of RS-(HgS)(n)-R chains which may self-assemble in parallel arrays to form cinnabar (alpha-HgS), or more commonly, quickly condense to four-coordinate metacinnabar (beta-HgS). The mechanistic pathway is thermodynamically favorable and its predicted kinetics agrees with experiment. The results provide robust theoretical support for the abiotic natural formation of nanoparticulate HgS under oxic conditions and in the absence of a catalyst, and suggest a new route for the (bio) synthesis of HgS nanoparticles with improved technological properties.									17	0	0	0	14	0	17			2045-2322			WOS:000389876600001	27991599

It is involved in plant growth, development, maturation, and aging, and also helps ameliorate various types of abiotic and biotic stresses, including salt, drought, heavy metals, and pathogens. Melatonin-related growth and defense responses of plants are complex, and involve many signaling molecules. Among these, the most important one is nitric oxide (NO), a freely diffusing amphiphilic biomolecule that can easily cross the cell membrane, produce rapid signal responses, and participate in a wide variety of physiological reactions. NO-induced S-nitrosylation is also involved in plant defense responses. NO interacts with melatonin as a long-range signaling molecule, and helps regulate plant growth and maintain oxidative homeostasis. Exposure of plants to abiotic stresses causes the increase of endogenous melatonin levels, with the consequent up-regulation of melatonin synthesis genes, and further increase of melatonin content. The application of exogenous melatonin causes an increase in endogenous NO and up-regulation of defense-related transcription factors, resulting in enhanced stress resistance. When plants are infected by pathogenic bacteria, NO acts as a downstream signal to lead to increased melatonin levels, which in turn induces the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascade and associated defense responses. The application of exogenous melatonin can also promote sugar and glycerol production, leading to increased levels of salicylic acid and NO. Melatonin and NO in plants can function cooperatively to promote lateral root growth, delay aging, and ameliorate iron deficiency. Further studies are needed to clarify certain aspects of the melatonin/NO relationship in plant physiology.									19	2	0	0	14	0	21				1422-0067		WOS:000506840100094	31818042	
J	Lee, Do-Yeon; Park, Minju; Kim, Namhee; Gu, Minsu; Kim, Hyoung-il; Kim, Byeong-Su								Sustainable hydrogen peroxide production based on dopamine through Janus-like mechanism transition from chemical to photocatalytic reactions								JOURNAL OF CATALYSIS				411				235	244		10.1016/j.jcat.2022.05.017				JUL 2022	2022	With increasing interest in hydrogen peroxide (H2O2 ) as an environmentally friendly oxidant for environmental remediation and a promising liquid fuel, we present herein a novel method for green and sustainable H(2)O(2 )production using versatile dopamine-based materials, demonstrating the conversion of H(2)O(2 )generation mechanism from a chemical to a photocatalytic process along with the structural transformation of dopamine to polydopamine. During the auto-oxidation of dopamine in the presence of oxygen, which involved the transition of catechol to hydroquinone groups and the ring closure of the amine group, H2O2 was chemically generated at a rate of 1.61 mmol g(-1)h(-1) without an extra electron donor and additional energy sources. In contrast, self-polymerized polydopamine exhibited an effective photo catalytic H(2)O(2 )generation at a rate of 0.53 mmol g(-1)h(-1) owing to its visible light absorptivity and semiconducting property. We anticipate that these unique properties of dopamine will provide a new class of organic-based, highly efficient solar-to-H(2)O(2 )conversion and sustainable energy systems in the future.

J	Zhang, HF; Fletcher, TH								Nitrogen transformations during secondary coal pyrolysis								ENERGY & FUELS				15	6			1512	1522		10.1021/ef010118g				NOV-DEC 2001	2001	A CO/H-2/O-2/N-2 flame was operated under fuel-rich conditions in a flat flame reactor to provide a high-temperature oxygen-free environment to study secondary reactions of coal volatiles. The distributions of fuel nitrogen in the devolatilization products of four coals, ranging from high volatile bituminous to lignite, were obtained at gas temperatures ranging from 1159 to 1858 K. It was found that the initial nitrogen released was contained almost exclusively in the tar for all coals. Release of nitrogen from the char as light gases started at a later stage than tar nitrogen release. During secondary reactions the nitrogen contents in the coal tars were higher than the nitrogen contents in the parent coals at temperatures below 1300 K. A rapid decay in the tar nitrogen content was observed between 1300 and 1600 K, followed by a much slower decrease in nitrogen content at temperatures above 1600 K. Nitrogen release from the coal tar can be described with first-order kinetics using the same rate constant for all the coals studied. Nitrogen release followed different routes in the tar and in the char, despite similar nitrogen functionalities in both products. Thermal decomposition of char was found to be an important source for nitrogen release at high temperatures. For low rank coals, NH3 was released earlier than HCN. For high rank coals, NH3 was released at the same time as HCN.									52	10	0	0	1	0	59			0887-0624			WOS:000172334500026		
J	WENDT, H; KHALIL, A; PADBERG, CE								HIGH-TEMPERATURE CHLORINE CORROSION OF TECHNICAL CARBONS .2. ANODIC CORROSION IN CHLORIDE MELT								JOURNAL OF APPLIED ELECTROCHEMISTRY				21	10			929	934		10.1007/BF01042461				OCT 1991	1991	Medium (200 to 400-degrees-C) to high (600 to 800-degrees-C) temperature corrosion of technical carbons (Acheson graphites) have been investigated in alkali chloride melts at chlorine evolving anodes. At low temperature in chloride melts containing free Lewis acid (AlCl3) no chlorine is evolved - even at high current densities - because chlorine, together with aluminium chloride, instantaneously from intercalation compounds with graphite and, as a consequence, the carbon desintegrates very rapidly. At 200-degrees-C carbon is consumed anodically in a C/Cl of molar ratio approximately 70/1. With increasing temperature Acheson graphites become more stable so that at 700-degrees-C short term destruction cannot be observed in melts which contain free Lewis acid. Chlorine corrosion of carbon electrodes in purified basic alkali chloride melts, which are free of oxygen carriers and, in particular, free of water at temperatures between 600 and 800-degrees-C in basic chloride melts, is an electrochemical reaction proceeding at low current densities slower than anticipated from thermodynamic data for carbon chlorination equilibria. The anodic carbon corrosion reaction has an activation energy of only 50 kJ mol-1 and its rate increases with increasing anode potential, or anodic current densities (rate: alpha-exp (i)). At a technical current density of 0.4 A cm-2 at 700-degrees-C the corrosion rate is estimated to be of the order of centimeters per year, rendering carbon anodes dimensionally unstable. Most important is to note that apart from CCl4, chlorinated carbon compounds (olefins and arenes) are generated as side-products which are noxious and ecologically dangerous and must not be released from processes which use carbon anodes for chlorine evolution from salt melts.									13	0	0	0	1	0	13			0021-891X			WOS:A1991GG99100014		
J	Cervini-Silva, Javiera; Gilbert, Benjamin; Fakra, Sirine; Friedrich, Stephan; Banfield, Jillian				Gilbert, Benjamin/E-3182-2010	Gilbert, Benjamin/0000-0003-0853-0826; Banfield, Jill/0000-0001-8203-8771			Coupled redox transformations of catechol and cerium at the surface of a cerium(III) phosphate mineral								GEOCHIMICA ET COSMOCHIMICA ACTA				72	10			2454	2464		10.1016/j.gca.2008.02.017				MAY 15 2008	2008	Highly insoluble Ce-bearing phosphate minerals form by weathering of apatite [Ca-5(PO4)(3)center dot(OH,F,Cl)], and are important phosphorous repositories in soils. Although these phases can be dissolved via biologically-mediated pathways, the dissolution mechanisms are poorly understood. In this paper we report spectroscopic evidence to support coupling of redox transformations of organic carbon and cerium during the reaction of rhabdophane (CePO4 center dot H2O) and catechol, a ubiquitous biogenic compound, at pH 5. Results show that the oxic-anoxic conditions influence the mineral dissolution behavior. Under anoxic conditions, the release of P and Ce occurs stoichiometrically. In contrast, under oxic conditions, the mineral dissolution behavior is incongruent, with dissolving Ce3+ ions oxidizing to CeO2. Reaction product analysis shows the formation of CO2, polymeric C, and oxalate and malate. The presence of more complex forms of organic carbon was also confirmed. Near edge X-ray absorption fine structure spectroscopy measurements at Ce-M-4.5 and C-K absorption edges on reacted CePO4 center dot H2O samples in the absence or presence of catechol and dissolved oxygen confirm that (1) the mineral surface converts to the oxide during this reaction, while full oxidation is limited to the near-surface region only; (2) the Ce valence remains unchanged when the reaction between CePO4 center dot H2O and O-2 but in the absence of catechol. Carbon K-edge spectra acquired from rhabdophane reacted with catechol under oxic conditions show spectral features before and after reaction that are considerably different from catechol, indicating the formation of more complex organic molecules. Decreases in intensity of characteristic catechol peaks are accompanied by the appearance of new pi* resonances due to carbon in carboxyl (ca. 288.5 eV) and carbonyl (ca. 289.3 eV) groups, and the development of broad structure in the sigma* region characteristic of aliphatic carbon. Evolution of the C K-edge spectra is consistent with aromatic-ring cleavage and polymerization. These results further substantiate that the presence of catechol, O-2 (aq) causes both the oxidation of structural Ce3+ and the transformation of catechol to more complex organic molecules. Scanning Transmission X-Ray Microscopy measurements at the C K and Ce M-4.5 edges indicate three dominant organic species, varying in complexity and association with the inorganic phase. Untransformed catechol is loosely associated with CeO2, whereas more complex organic molecules that exhibit lower aromaticity and stronger C=O pi* resonances of carboxyl-C and carbonyl-C groups are only found in association with the grains. These results further serve as basis to postulate that, in the presence of O-2, CeO2 can mediate the oxidative polymerization of catechol to form higher molecular weight polymers. The present work provides evidence for a pathway of biologically-induced, non-enzymatic oxidation of cerium and formation of small CeO2 particles at room temperature. These findings may have implications for carbon cycling in natural and cerium-contaminated soils and aqueous environments.

The thermal decomposition behavior of the complex was studied by thermogravimetric analysis. X-ray diffractometry was used to investigate the structure of the products from the complex thermal decomposition and the formation of SmFeO2 from the oxide mixture. Powders prepared by both methods were used to deposit thick films onto alumina substrates with comb-type gold electrodes. The microstructure and chemical homogeneity of the film surfaces,were investigated by scanning electron microscopy and Auger electron spectroscopy. Thick SmFeO3 single-phase films having a homogeneous elemental distribution on the surface were obtained when powder prepared by thermal decomposition of the complex was used for deposition, even when the powder was fired at low temperature (800 degreesC), Surface chemical analysis was performed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), The O Is XPS line was deconvoluted into two peaks, attributed to adsorbed oxygen (O-ad) and oxygen in the lattice (O-lattice). Quantitative analysis showed that the surface coverage of iron, expressed as Fe/(Fe + Sm), was larger for the films prepared using the solid-state reacted powder. Although the O-lattice/(Fe + Sm) atomic ratio was not influenced by the processing procedures (and, thus, by iron surface coverage), the amount of O-ad decreased with increasing iron surface coverage, A model of the SmFeO3 surface was used to determine that the outermost layer of the perovskite-type SmFeO3 prepared from the complex consisted mainly of samarium ions that could each bond four adsorbed oxygen ions. A single oxygen ion could adsorb onto an iron ion, and therefore, the content of adsorbed oxygen was lower for the film prepared from the solid state reacted powders, which showed larger iron surface coverage. Electrical conductance measurements, performed with increasing temperature in different gaseous environments, confirmed these findings. Higher conductances and lower activation energies were observed for the films with larger samarium surface coverage.									75	3	1	0	0	0	75			0002-7820			WOS:000166972500014

The key parameter for the realisation of these devices is the controlled large-area growth of WS2 combined with tuning the surface morphology and electronic properties which is achieved by bottom-up fabrication methods such as chemical vapour deposition (CVD). In this study, 2H-WS2 films are fabricated by a new metal-organic CVD (MOCVD) process resulting in the growth of crystalline, pure, and stoichiometric films which was accomplished at temperatures as low as 600 degrees C as confirmed by X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), Rutherford backscattering spectrometry (RBS)/nuclear reaction analysis (NRA), and Raman spectroscopy. The surface morphology of WS2 layers was investigated by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM). Following successful process development, the WS2 layers were deposited on conducting FTO/glass substrates and their catalytic activity for the HER was evaluated in a linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) experiment. Furthermore, the temperature-dependent sensor response towards NO2, CO, and NH3 was investigated for WS2 films deposited on special sensor chips, revealing a p-type response towards NO2 and NH3 and sensitivities of around 20% for NO2 and NH3 concentrations of 1.5 ppm and 7.6 ppm, respectively. These promising results demonstrate the effectiveness of scalable CVD-grown WS2 and pave the way for practical applications by modulating the properties of materials to achieve enhanced electrocatalytic and sensing performances employing WS2 layers.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			2050-7526	2050-7534		WOS:000677451800001

The effects of urea on the structural and electrochemical characteristics are investigated in detail. As the urea increased, the morphology of the free-standing Co3O4 turns from hexagonal nanosheets to nanoflakes, and finally turns to nanoflakes/nanowires hybrid structure. This hybrid structure is made up of ultrathin porous nanoflakes, and short nanowires anchored at the edge of the nanoflakes, which may enhance the diffusion rate of the electrolyte and O-2 and provide more active sites for both O-2 reduction and evolution reactions. When applied as a free-standing cathode for the Li-O-2 cells, it shows better performance for the nanoflakes/nanowires hybrid structure than the others. It exhibits a high specific capacity of 5958 mA h g(-1) at 0.1 mA cm(-2), a long cycle life of 108 cycles with a limited capacity of 500 mA h g(-1), and unique morphology of the discharge products.

However, the development of efficient, low-cost and high stable heterogeneous catalyst for selective dehydrogenation of FA remains a major challenge. In this paper, a simple co-reduction method is proposed to synthesize nitrogen phosphorus co-functionalized rGO (NPG) supported ultrafine NiCoPd-CeOx nanoparticles (NPs) with a mean size of 1.2 nm. Remarkably, the as-prepared Ni0.2Co0.2Pd0.6-CeOx/NPG shows outstanding catalytic activity for FA dehydrogenation, affording a high TOF value of 6506.8 mol H2 mol Pd-1 h(-1) at 303 K and a low activation energy of 17.7 kJ mol(-1), which is better than most of the reported heterogeneous catalysts, and can be ascribed to the combined effect of well-dispersed ultrafine NiCoPd-CeOx NPs, modified Pd electronic structure, and abundant active sites. The reaction mechanism of dehydrogenation of FA is also discussed. Furthermore, the optimized Ni0.2Co0.2Pd0.6-CeOx/NPG shows excellent stability over 10th run with 100% conversion and 100% H-2 selectivity, which may provide more possibilities for practical application of FA system on fuel cells.

Thus, in this work, C,N-codoped Fe2P/Ni2P (CN/FeNiP) polyhedrons derived from NH2-MIL-101(Fe)/Ni (OH)(2) were used as cocatalysts to modify graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) for photocatalytic hydrogen production from water splitting under visible-light irradiation. The highest evolution rate observed over CN/FeNiP/g-C3N4 was 13.81 mmol g(-1)h(-1) under 1.0 mmol L-1 of Eosin Y (EY) sensitization (compared to 0.196 mmol g(-1) h(-1) without EY sensitization), which was about 10 and 5 times higher than that of g-C3N4(1.33 mmol g(-1)h(-1)) and CN/FeP/g-C3N4(2.73 mmol h(-1)). The apparent quantum yield at 420 nm reached 45.8%. A detail analysis of the mechanism revealed that the improved photocatalytic activity can be ascribed to highly efficient spatial separation of photoinduced charges from the excited EY and g-C(3)N(4 )to CN/FeNiP with tight interface, staggered band energy between g-C3N4, CN/Fe2P and Ni2P as well as accelerated surface reaction by CN/FeNiP cocatalysts. This work demonstrates that MOF-derived hybrid hollow metal phosphide can be good substitutes for noble metal catalysts for photocatalytic hydrogen production.									120	15	0	0	20	0	123			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000449444000019		
J	Lei Yu; Jianguo Wen								Unveiling the roles of Co and Mn in structural stability for Ni-rich Cathodes								Microscopy and Microanalysis				27	suppl.1			3436	8		10.1017/S1431927621011818				2021	2021	Summary form only given. Ternary Ni-rich layered oxides (LiNixMnyCozO2 Ni-rich NMC; x ges 0.5) have been regarded as one of most promising cathode candidates for next-generation Lithium-ion battery. They combine the advantages of multiple elements. Among them, it is well known that the main Ni contributes to highcapacity, Co improves conductivity and reduces Li/Ni disorder, and Mn enhances thermal stability. However, the effects of Co and Mn components on stabilizing the layered structure remain unclear. Especially, meeting with commercialization, the cost of rawmaterials also must be considered. It is very important to understand their individual roles and design reasonable component ratios for advanced electrode materials. In this study, the structural evolution of binary LiNi0.6Co0.4O2 (NC64) and LiNi0.6Mn0.4O2 (NM64) were investigated by aberration-corrected high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) and electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS), respectively. Both of NC64 and NM64 presented a complete rock-salt phase on the surface after prolonged cycles, which suggests that surface phase transformation was independent of the Co and Mn content. The formation of rock-salt phase inevitably results form a reduction reaction of surface Ni4+ ions with the electrolyte. Then, a clear difference was observedin the subsurface area. The subsurface structure of NC64 completely transited to a spinel-like structure. Such an irreversible phase transition is related to oxygen release, which triggers transition metal (TM) migration to Li slab. By comparison, the structure stability of NM64 was superior and it remained a typical layered structure on the bulk after 100 cycles. EELS is utilized to analyze the redox reversibility and valance evolution of transition metal elements. The O K-edge prepeak only decreases near the surface of NM64, and the L edges of Ni and Mn consistently show leftward shifts near the surface. These results suggest that severe structural deterioration only occurs on surface areas of the NM64 particles. In contrast, for NC64, the decrease of O K-edge prepeak not only occurs on the surface, but also extends into the bulk. Furthermore, its energy position of whole Ni-L edge also shows leftward shifts compared with the bulk of NM64. These results further demonstrate the lower valence state of Ni and irreversible phase transition occurred in the bulk of NC64. In summary, for Ni-rich cathodes, although high Ni contents were previously recognized as the origin of capacity degradation, it is found that Co also promotes the irreversible structural transformation, while Mn inhibits irreversible phase transitions during cycling.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1431-9276			INSPEC:20807307

In this work, unique CdS/Cd0.5Zn0.5S-Mo-1-xWxS2 photocatalyst constructed by CdS hollow nano-spheres with successively surface-modified Cd0.5Zn0.5S shell and defect-rich Mo1-xWxS2 ultrathin nanosheets was reported for the first time. Interestingly, the Cd0.5Zn0.5S shell could greatly enhance the photo-stability and reduce the carrier recombination of CdS. Meanwhile, enriching active sites and accelerating charge transfer could be achieved via anchoring defect-rich Mo1-xWxS2 onto CdS/Cd0.5Zn0.5S hollow heterostructures. Specifically, the optimized CdS/Cd0.5Zn0.5S-Mo1-xWxS2 (6 h Cd0.5Zn0.5S-coating, 7 wt.% Mo1-xWxS2, x = 0.5) hybrid delivered an exceptional H-2 generation rate of 215.99 mmol center dot g(-1)center dot h(-1), which is approximately 502, 134, and 23 times that of pure CdS, CdS/Cd0.5Zn0.5S, and 3 wt.% Pt-loaded CdSZCd(0.5)Zn(0.5)S, respectively. Remarkably, a high H-2 evolution reaction (HER) apparent quantum yield (AQY) of 64.81% was obtained under 420-nm irradiation. In addition, the CdS/Cd0.5Zn0.5S-Mo1-xWxS2 was also durable for H-2 production under long-term irradiation. This work provides valuable inspirations to rational design and synthesis of efficient and stable hybrid photocatalysts for solar energy conversion.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			1998-0124	1998-0000		WOS:000671718700004

P-31 MAS NMR showed the presence of resonances due to the phosphate and phosphonate groups bonded to the Zr atoms mainly by three oxygen atoms, as in the alpha-type layer. The composition of the ZP(C-n)(x) materials, obtained by thermogravimetric analysis, ranges from x approximate to 0.2 to x approximate to 1.1. On the basis of the NMR data and of the analysis of the X-ray patterns of gels and powders, it is inferred that the ZP(C-n)(x) compounds have an alpha-type layered structure and that the reaction between alpha-ZrP and H2Cn is a topotactic anion exchange process. The evolution of the X-ray patterns during propanol deintercalation is consistent with a random distribution of the alkylphosphonate groups on the a-type layers which gives rise to porous pathways in the interlayer region. To test the possibility of using ZP(C-n)(x) as mechanical reinforcement of a polymer matrix, a starch membrane filled with 5 wt % ZP(C-6)(0.54) was prepared and characterized by stress strain mechanical tests.

The formation of nanostructures and the morphological evolution were confirmed by transmission electron microscopy, scanning electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction analysis, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy, energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, elemental mapping analysis, and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. CuO nanostructures with different morphologies were tested for the catalytic oxidative coupling of aromatic amines to imines under solvent-free conditions. We found that the flake-shaped CuO nanostructures exhibited superior catalytic efficiency compared to that of the dandelion-and short-ribbon-shaped CuO nanostructures. We also performed extensive density functional theory (DFT) calculations to gain atomic-level insight into the intriguing reactivity trends observed for the different CuO nanostructures. Our DFT calculations provided for the first time a detailed and comprehensive view of the oxidative coupling reaction of benzylamine over CuO, which yields N-benzylidene-1-phenylmethanamine as the major product. CuO(111) is identified as the reactive surface; the specific arrangement of coordinatively unsaturated Cu and O sites on the most stable CuO(111) surface allows N-H and C-H bond-activation reactions to proceed with low-energy barriers. The high catalytic activity of the flake-shaped CuO nanostructure can be attributed to the greatest exposure of the active CuO(111) facets. Our finding sheds light on the prospective utility of inexpensive CuO nanostructured catalysts with different morphologies in performing solvent-free oxidative coupling of aromatic amines to obtain biologically and pharmaceutically important imine derivatives with high selectivity.									30	0	0	0	8	0	30			2470-1343			WOS:000392721200007	31457184

A nitrogen-rich polymer of an intrinsic microporosity (PIM) precursor is impregnated with PtC162 to give (after vacuum carbonization at 700 degrees C) a nitrogen-containing heterocarbon with embedded Pt nanoparticles of typically 1-4 nm diameter (with some particles up to 20 nm diameter). The Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface area of this hybrid material is 518 m(2) g(-1) (with a cumulative pore volume of 1.1 cm(3) g(-1)) consistent with the surface area of the corresponding platinum-free heterocarbon. In electrochemical experiments, the heterocarbon-embedded nano-platinum is observed as reactive towards hydrogen oxidation, but essentially non-reactive towards bigger molecules during methanol oxidation or during oxygen reduction. Therefore, oxygen reduction under electrochemical conditions is suggested to occur mainly via a 2-electron pathway on the outer carbon shell to give H2O2. Kinetic selectivity is confirmed in exploratory catalysis experiments in the presence of H-2 gas (which is oxidized on Pt) and O-2 gas (which is reduced on the heterocarbon surface) to result in the direct formation of H2O2.									6	0	0	0	1	0	6			2079-4991			WOS:000442523100093	30021972

These include superoxide (O.(-)(2)), hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), hydroxyl radical (HO.) and peroxyl (ROO.) and alkoxyl (RO.) radicals which may be involved in the initiation and propagation of free radical chain reactions and which are potentially highly damaging to cells. Mechanisms have evolved to restrict and control such processes, partly by compartmentation, and partly by antioxidant defences such as chain-breaking antioxidant compounds capable forming stable free radicals (e.g. ascorbate, alpha-tocopherol) and the evolution of enzyme systems (e.g. superoxide dismutase, catalase, peroxidases) that diminish the intracellular concentration of the ROS. Although some ROS perform useful functions, the production of ROS exceeding the ability of the organism to mount an antioxidant defence results in oxidative stress and the ensuing tissue damage may be involved in certain disease processes. Evidence that ROS are involved in primary pathological mechanisms is a feature mainly of extraneous physical or chemical perturbations of which radiation is perhaps the major contributor. One of the important radiation-induced free-radical species is the hydroxyl radical which indiscriminately attacks neighbouring molecules often at near diffusion-controlled rates. Hydroxyl radicals are generated by ionizing radiation either directly by oxidation of water, or indirectly by the formation of secondary partially ROS. These may be subsequently converted to hydroxyl radicals by further reduction ('activation') by metabolic processes in the cell. Secondary radiation injury is therefore influenced by the cellular antioxidant status and the amount and availability of activating mechanisms. The biological response to radiation may be modulated by alterations in factors affecting these secondary mechanisms of cellular injury.									1051	24	5	1	771	8	1101			0955-3002			WOS:A1994NE75800004	7905906	
J	Wong, Ka Hung; Kjeang, Erik								Macroscopic In-Situ Modeling of Chemical Membrane. Degradation in Polymer Electrolyte Fuel Cells								JOURNAL OF THE ELECTROCHEMICAL SOCIETY				161	9			F823	F832		10.1149/2.0031409jes				2014	2014	Chemical membrane degradation is a major limiting factor for polymer electrolyte fuel cell (PEFC) durability and lifetime. While the main degradation mechanisms are established in the literature, the in-situ trends of their action are often only known qualitatively. This motivates the development of a comprehensive in-situ chemical membrane degradation model addressed in this work. The numerical algorithms developed are strategically designed to be compatible with state-of-the-art computational membrane electrolyte assembly (MEA) performance models; here, we emphasize the integration of the developed degradation model into a 1-D MEA transport-reaction model to determine the linkages between the MEA macroscopic phenomena, in-situ operating conditions, and the temporal membrane degradation process. Concentrations of hydrogen peroxide, radical, and degraded ionomer species are, modeled to interrogate the evolution of ionomer molecular structure with respect to the chemical membrane degradation. The proposed degradation mechanism includes the initiation and propagation of side chain degradation culminating in main chain scission and fragmentation, and demonstrates a good agreement with the most recent experimental findings. The integrated MEA model is further applied to simulate the macroscopic effects of chemical membrane degradation characterized in a recent accelerated stress test. Comparisons between the numerical and experimental results are discussed. (C) 2014 The Electrochemical Society.

Gallic acid, caffeic acid, p-coumaric acid, trans-resveratrol, glutahionyl caftaric acid and protocatechuic acid did not vary remarkably during the first three months, whereas at six months a net increase was reported, followed by a clear decrease at 12 months. The same trend was observed in Lagrein rose, but only for gallic acid. The total anthocyanins content decreased during the storage period in the four wines. Isopentyl acetate, 1-hexanol, ethyl hexanoate, 2-phenylethyl alcohol, diethyl succinate, ethyl octanoate and ethyl decanoate were the main volatile compounds. The sum of alcohols decreased in all four of the wines. The esters decreased in Merlot; however, they increased in Lagrein rose, Lagrein red and St. Magdalener during the storage. Univariate and multivariate statistics and a sensory discriminant triangle test displayed similar influences of the different stoppers on the phenolic and volatile compounds during the whole storage duration. The changes detected in the phenolic and volatile concentrations were presumably due to the non-oxygen-mediated reactions occurring during 12 months of storage in bottle.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5				1420-3049		WOS:000581191500001	32961925

In this study, composition-controlled Co-Cu alloys were fabricated by electrodeposition for use as HER catalysts in proton exchange membrane water electrolyzers (PEMWEs). As the Cu content in the alloy increased, the morphology changed from needle-shaped particles to small round particles. Furthermore, a phase transition from a hexagonal close-packed structure to a face-centered cubic structure occurs because the latter structure is stabilized by adding Cu to Co. The optimum catalyst composition for the HER was found to be Co59Cu41, which had an overpotential of 342 mV at -10 mA cm(-2). This catalyst exhibited excellent durability, showing a potential reduction of approximately 100 mV over 12 hours under a constant current density. This superior performance was attributed to the increase in the electrochemical surface area resulting from the addition of Cu, as confirmed by electrochemical double layer capacitance measurements, in addition to a counterbalance between the hydrogen adsorption energies of Co and Cu. Finally, the application of the Co-Cu alloy catalyst as a cathode catalyst in a PEMWE resulted in excellent performance of 1.2 A cm(-2) at 2.0 V-cell.									13	1	0	0	0	0	13			0363-907X	1099-114X		WOS:000504841300001

Our results show that very thin layers, or islands, can retain on their surface molecules that are able to react through their NH(2) functions. We have tested and assessed by X-Ray Electron Spectroscopy (XPS) and Quartz Crystal Microbalance (QCM) the surface density of chemical functions vs. layer thicknesses by using chemical derivatization with two types of agents: imine formation by a reaction of primary amine from the coating with aldehyde (Pentafluorobenzaldehyde, PFBA) and amide-bond formation by reaction with an activated carboxylic group (Succinimidyl Succinate Terminated Polyethylene glycol, EGSS). Results show that the PPAA coatings-even for very thin layers of a few nanometers-promote the chemisorption of the tagging molecules.

In this work, we have developed a moderate method to realize the synthesis of transition metal sulfide ball-in-ball hollow nanospheres (Co-Cu-WSx, Co-WSx and Co-CuSx BHSs). Importantly, it was found that these ball-in-ball hollow nanospheres exhibited superior electrocatalytic properties for dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) and the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in alkaline medium. Compared with the ternary Co-WSx and Co-CuSx counterparts, the quaternary Co-Cu-WSx nanospheres exhibited excellent behavior in accelerating the reduction of I-3(-) in DSSCs and expediting the HER in water splitting. Specifically, DSSCs based on Co-Cu-WSx BHSs achieved a splendid power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 9.61% which was higher than that of Pt (8.24%) under the same conditions. Also, a lower eta(10) of 82.5 mV and a smaller Tafel slope of 53.8 mV per decade were obtained for a Co-Cu-WSx electrocatalyst for the HER in 1.0 M KOH. The present approach is proposed as a new idea for the design of transition metal sulfide hollow nanospheres for different energy conversion applications.									40	1	0	0	1	0	40			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000463970400044

Herein, a one-step strategy was developed to synthesize multi-walled carbon nanotubes and reduced graphene oxide supported Pt nanoparticle hydrogel (PtNP/rGO-MWCNT), in which only ascorbic acid was used as the reductant for one-pot reduction of both GO and chloroplatinic acid. The hydrogel can be directly used as a flexible binder-free catalytic electrode to achieve high performance of HER. Compared to conventional strategies, the current strategy not only significantly reduces the Pt loading to 3.48 wt%, simplifies the synthesis process, but also eliminates the use of any polymer binders, thus decreasing the series resistance and improving catalytic activity. An overpotential of only 11 mV was achieved on as-prepared PtNP/rGO-MWCNT to drive a geometrical current density of 10 mA/cm(2) in 0.5 mol/L H2SO4, with its catalytic activity being kept over 15 h. In acidic medium, the HER activity of the PtNP/rGO-MWCNT catalyst exceeds most of the reported Pt-based electro-catalysts and is 3-fold higher than that obtained on commercial Pt/C electrode.

The conversion of POMC into adrenocorticotropic hormone and then into a-melanocyte-stimulating hormone, an amidated peptide, provided a model system for identifying the amidating enzyme. Peptidylglycine alpha-amidating monooxygenase (PAM), the only enzyme that catalyzes this modification, is essential; mice lacking PAM survive only until mid-gestation. Purification and cloning led to the discovery that the amidation of peptidylglycine substrates proceeds in two steps: peptidylglycine a-hydroxylating monooxygenase catalyzes the copper-and ascorbate-dependent alpha-hydroxylation of the peptidylglycine substrate; peptidyl-alpha-hydroxyglycine alpha-amidating lyase cleaves the N-C bond, producing amidated product and glyoxylate. Both enzymes are contained in the luminal domain of PAM, a type 1 integral membrane protein. The structures of both catalytic cores have been determined, revealing how they interact with metals, molecular oxygen, and substrate to catalyze both reactions. Although not essential for activity, the intrinsically disordered cytosolic domain is essential for PAM trafficking. A phylogenetic survey led to the identification of bifunctional membrane PAM in Chlamydomonas, a unicellular eukaryote. Accumulating evidence points to a role for PAM in copper homeostasis and in retrograde signaling from the lumen of the secretory pathway to the nucleus. The discovery of PAM in cilia, cellular antennae that sense and respond to environmental stimuli, suggests that much remains to be learned about this ancient protein.									50	0	0	0	45	0	50			0952-5041	1479-6813		WOS:000380717100007	26667899

The utilization of hydrogen energy has developed rapidly, but it is far from the requirement of human. Therefore, it is very urgent to develop methodologies and technologies for efficient hydrogen production, especially high activity and durable electrocatalysts. Here a bimetallic oxide cluster on heterostructure of vanadium ruthenium oxides/graphdiyne (VRuOx/GDY) is reported. The unique acetylene-rich structure of graphdiyne achieves outstanding characteristics of electrocatalyst: i) controlled preparation of catalysts for achieving multiple-metal clusters; ii) regulation of catalyst composition and morphology for synthesizing high-performance catalysts; iii) highly active and durable hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) properties. The optimal porous electrocatalyst (VRu0.027Ox/GDY) can deliver 10 mA cm(-2) at low overpotentials of 13 and 12 mV together with robust long-term stability in alkaline and neutral media, respectively, which are much smaller than Pt/C. The results reveal that the synergism of different components can efficiently facilitate the electron/mass transport properties, reduce the energy barrier, and increase the active site number for high catalytic performances.									8	0	0	0	0	0	8				2198-3844		WOS:000693659500001	34935313

As a potential electrocatalyst, the improvement of HER performance catalyzed by nanostructured transition metal phosphides still remains a great challenge. Tuning the novel nanostructure, morphology, and electronic state from nanoscale is of great important to achieve highly efficient HER electrocatalysts. Herein, we first developed an electronic structure and d-band center control engineering for accelerating the HER process in both acid and alkaline media over M-doped CoP (M = Ni, Mn, Fe) hollow polyhedron frames (HPFs), which were synthesized by a self-templating transformation (STT) strategy. Impressively, the HER electrocatalytic activity can be maximumly promoted and maintained at least 21 h for Ni-CoP/HPFs catalyst. Synchrotron-based X-ray absorption near-edge structure, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, auger electron spectroscopy, ultraviolet photoemission spectroscopy and density functional theory calculations consistently reveal the improved performance is attributed to the changes of the electronic structure and the downshift of d-band center after metal doping. The Ni-CoP/HPFs catalyst also indicates excellent activity with a cell voltage of 1.43 V to achieve the current density of 10 mA cm(-2) and superior stability when it was employed as a cathode for HER and an anode for urea oxidation in 1 M KOH with 0.5 M urea. The success modulation of HER performance in current SIT strategy will provide a promising pathway for designing various transition metal-doped compounds for energy-related catalysis processes.									283	20	0	0	13	0	283			2211-2855	2211-3282		WOS:000455264600043

In this work, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was applied for studying the aging effect on LSM-YSZ cathodes exposed to humidified air at 900 degrees C for up to 3000 h. EIS spectra were fitted by a transmission line model for estimating relevant parameters associated with the LSM/YSZ charge transfer reaction and the oxide ion conduction through the YSZ network. For the reference non-aged sample, the ionic conductivity values are the expected ones for YSZ with 1 eV activation energy and no dependency on oxygen partial pressure (pO(2)), while the charge transfer resistance presents an activation energy of 1.6 eV and is proportional to (pO(2))(-0.31 +/- 0.08). These values agree with those reported in literature, validating the used model. The charge transfer resistance shows no clear tendency with aging time, while the ionic conductivity decreases up to similar to 79%. Accordingly, the electrochemically active thickness contracts from 60-135 mu m to 45-60 mu m. The changes observed in the cathode transport and electrochemical properties are mostly explained by the evolution of the phases present in agreement with results previously reported in the literature.

In this study, we cloned and characterized the genes encoding IGF-1 and IGFBP-1 to improve the current knowledge on their roles in highland Bos grunniens (Yak). We also compared their expression levels in the liver and kidney tissues between yaks and lowland cattle. We obtained full-length 465 bp IGF-1 and 792 bp IGFBP-1, encoding 154 amino acids (AA) IGF-1, and 263 AA IGFBP-1 protein, respectively using reverse transcriptase-polyerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) technology. Analysis of their corresponding amino acid sequences showed a high identity between B. grunniens and lowland mammals. Moreover, the two genes were proved to be widely distributed in the examined tissues through expression pattern analysis. Real-time PCR results revealed that IGF-1 expression was higher in the liver and kidney tissues in B. grunniens than in Bos taurus (p<0.05). The IGFBP-1 gene was expressed at a higher level in the liver (p<0.05) of B. taurus than B. grunniens, but it has a similar expression level in the kidneys of the two species. These results indicated that upregulated IGF-1 and downregulated IGFBP-1 are associated with hypoxia adaptive response in B. grunniens.									3	0	0	0	3	0	3			1011-2367	1976-5517		WOS:000347870000004	25557672

The NDs were prepared by a combined methods of soft lithography-nanosphere lithography, physical vapor deposition (PVD) and electrochemical deposition using polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) as template. The water splitting activity of the 3D nanostructures were examined in 6 M KOH solution using polarization and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy techniques. The data obtained showed that well-structured and uniformly distributed Ni-NDs could be fabricated using this combined method. The ND arrays perform excellent hydrogen evolution activity with respect to Ni plate as a reference point since their nano-sized roughness results in larger real surface area. By comparing with Ni plate, lower hydrogen onset potential (85 mV) and charge transfer resistance (90.1%) as well as higher current density (90.4%) corresponding to the amount of evolved hydrogen were observed at the NDs. The Ni-NDs have high time stability in the electrolysis conditions. It is believed that the Ni-ND arrays contribute to the design of novel electrocatalytic electrodes as candidate supporting materials. (C) 2018 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC.

The heterostructure showed efficient hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in both acidic and alkaline electrolytes. All of the results for experiments and theoretical calculations evidenced that GDY can be chemisorbed on the surface of MoS2, which lead to the 2H-to-1T phase transformation of MoS2, and the enhancement of electric conductivity, and thus giving a near-zero Gibbs free energy. The GDY-MoS2 NS/CF shows a better HER activity with a low overpotential of only 90 mV to deliver current density of 10 mA cm(-2) in alkaline conditions, which is superior to that of 20% Pt/C (103 mV) and 45.7 times larger than pristine MoS2 in transient photocurrent. The catalytic mechanisms of such GDY-based heterostructures are clear for understanding the catalytic mechanism on the atomic level. The unique heterostructure of the GDY encapsulating MoS2 showed high HER activity and the electrocatalyst with extraordinary long-term stability at all pH values, which compares favourably to all reported MoS2-based electrocatalysts and most of other benchmarked electrocatalysts. This provide an efficient strategy for developing highly active and stable electrocatalyst.									43	5	0	0	2	0	44			2211-2855	2211-3282		WOS:000454636200013

Systematic studies over the evolution of the galvanization process are still important in order to determine key feature on the structural transformation. On this paper, electron microscopy techniques were used to correlate the crystallinity of Ag/Pt nanoboxes of 78 nm in size with low and high-index facets surfaces from Ag nanocubes template. It was observed that 1.6 mu mol addition of platinum precursor is enough to produce Ag/Pt nanoboxes. However, the crystallinity of the walls was tune from single crystal to polycrystalline by increasing the amount of platinum. More importantly, electron tomography reconstructions allow us to identify the concavities sides on the polycrystalline double-layer porous sample. Platinum content and nanostructure has been also associated to the optical properties were an extinction of the absorption band is observed after the solid template has been fully transformed to a nanobox. The final Ag/Pt porous/hollow nanoboxes with concave sides were tested on a model reaction for the reduction of 4-ntp to 4-amp.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			1388-0764	1572-896X		WOS:000412045100001

A heterostructured system composed of MoSx deposited on NiO nanostructures (MoSx@NiO) as a robust catalyst for water splitting is proposed here. NiO nanosponges are applied as cocatalyst for MoS2 in alkaline media. Both NiO and MoS2@NiO composites are prepared by a hydrothermal method. The NiO nanostructures exhibit sponge-like morphology and are completely covered by the sheet-like MoS2. The NiO and MoS2 exhibit cubic and hexagonal phases, respectively. In the MoSx@NiO composite, the HER experiment in 1 m KOH electrolyte results in a low overpotential (406 mV) to produce 10 mA cm(-2) current density. The Tafel slope for that case is 43 mV per decade, which is the lowest ever achieved for MoS2-based electrocatalyst in alkaline media. The catalyst is highly stable for at least 13 h, with no decrease in the current density. This simple, cost-effective, and environmentally friendly methodology can pave the way for exploitation of MoSx@NiO composite catalysts not only for water splitting, but also for other applications such as lithium ion batteries, and fuel cells.									65	2	0	0	2	0	66			1616-301X	1616-3028		WOS:000459719800018

Herein, we demonstrated a facile approach for the in situ growth of NiS-Ni2P2S6 nanosheets on nickel foam (NF) (NiS-Ni2P2S6/NF) via one-step calcination at low temperature. Benefitting from the fast electron and mass transfer and the unique 3D self-supported structure as well as the synergistic effect between NiS and Ni2P2S6, the optimized NiS-Ni2P2S6/NF exhibits superior OER and HER electrocatalytic activity in 1.0 M KOH with small overpotentials of 220 mV and 140 mV to achieve the current density of 10 mA cm(-2), respectively. Moreover, the as-prepared NiS-Ni2P2S6/NF could be used as both the cathode and anode in a two-electrode water splitting cell, which can deliver the current density of 10 mA cm(-2) under a cell voltage of 1.64 V with satisfactory stability, implying its promising prospects in practical scale-up applications.									60	6	0	0	0	0	61			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000414073400006

The results indicated that the PSI light energy absorption was not affected by changing pH of suspending media. The low-temperature fluorescence yield of the dominating long-wavelength emission band at 734 nm was decreased with increasing pH, whereas it did not exhibit changes in the major peak position at pHs studied except for pH 12, where the major peak in low-temperature chlorophyll (Chl) fluorescence emission spectra was shifted toward the blue light by 5 nm. Pronounced changes were found in PSI photochemical activities. Mild alkalinity (pH 8-10) in suspending media stimulated the rate of oxygen uptake with a maximum activity of oxygen consumption at about pH 9, while the other pHs exhibited an inhibition as compared to the control at pH 7.8. The rate of P700 photooxidation increased with the increasing pH, and the optimum for the reaction activity was in the region of pH 9-11. Circular dichroism spectra revealed that a progressive increase occurred in the conformation of the a-helices as pH value decreased from pH 7.8 to 3.0 or increased from pH 7.8 to 12.0. The results demonstrated that the Chl states in PSI particles were highly stable, while the photochemical activities and protein secondary structures were very sensitive to the pH stimuli of external medium.									5	0	1	0	5	0	6			1021-4437	1608-3407		WOS:000269634100003

Tuning the local electronic environment of Ni in NiFe2O4 is expected to be an efficient approach to alter the electronic properties and tailor the intrinsic activity of Ni sites. Herein, a series of Ni1-xCoxFe2O4 (x = 0.01, 0.02, 0.05, and 0.1) were synthesized through a one-pot hydrothermal process, aiming to tune the electronic structure of nickel ferrite and to offer insights into the design of highly active nickel ferrite-based catalysts. TEM and XPS characterization experiments show that the partial substitution of Ni by Co decreases the particle size and alters the electronic properties, respectively. Electrochemical measurements show that the dopant concentration plays a key role in tailoring the catalytic performance of nickel ferrite towards the OER, and that the optimized Ni1-xCoxFe2O4 displays a small overpotential of 227 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) in 1 M KOH. DFT calculations show that the incorporation of Co changes the rate-determining step and promotes the catalytic activity of Ni because of the Ni-Co interaction-induced change in electronic properties. This study offers new insights into the active sites of nickel ferrite and the design of advanced nickel ferrite catalysts.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			2398-4902			WOS:000643903300001

The concentration of Eu2+ at the expense of Eu3+ cations is privileged via the codoping with higher valence state ions. For BaAl2Si2O8, it appears difficult to stabilize Eu3+ because of difference in radius between the Eu3+ and Ba2+ cations even prepared in pure oxygen atmosphere. The "only" Eu2+ doped MASO needs to be prepared in reducing atmosphere and exhibit a bluish-white luminescence centred at similar to 425, 404 and 440 nm due to the allowed 4f(6)5d(1)-> 4f(7)(S-8(7/2)) radiative transition for M from Ca to Ba. The irregular evolution of the emission wavelengths going from Ca to Ba could be assigned to a modification of the local chemical environment of Eu2+. For MASO (M = Ca, Sr) compositions, the strongest 4f-4f emission peaks originated from Eu3+ located at similar to 611 nm are attributed to the D-5(0)-> F-7(2) transition and can be sensitized by energy transfer from Eu2+. These lead to the addition of red contribution to the bluish one observed for only Eu2+-doped materials. We expected to take benefit of these observations to generate new phosphors in the future with a control of the CIE (x, y) parameters and to tune white emission from cold to warm.

The Pt/VG-SPEs exhibit remarkable HER activity with an overpotential (recorded at -10 mA cm(-2)) and Tafel value of 47 mV (vs. RHE) and 27 mV dec(-1). These values demonstrate the Pt/VG-SPEs as significantly more electrocatalytic than a bare/unmodified VG-SPE (789 mV (vs. RHE) and 97 mV dec(-1)). The uniform coverage of Pt(0)nanoparticles (ca. 3 nm) upon the VG-SPE support results in a low loading of Pt(0)nanoparticles (ca. 4 mu g cm(-2)), yet yields comparable HER activity to optimal Pt based catalysts reported in the literature, with the advantages of being comparatively cheap, highly reproducible and tailorable platforms for HER catalysis. In order to test any potential dissolution of Pt(0)from the Pt/VG-SPE surface, which is a key consideration for any HER catalyst, we additively manufactured (AM) a bespoke electrochemical flow cell that allowed for the electrolyte to be collected at regular intervals and analysedviainductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES). The AM electrochemical cell can be rapidly tailored to a plethora of geometries making it compatible with any size/shape of electrochemical platform. This work presents a novel and highly competitive HER platform and a novel AM technique for exploring the extent of Pt(0)nanoparticle dissolution upon the electrode surface, making it an essential study for those seeking to test the stability/catalyst discharge of their given electrochemical platforms.									13	0	0	0	0	0	13			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000571342700021	32856624

To address the persistent issue of hetero-phase interfacing on carbon support while ensuring high activity and stability, a low-cost, high-performance hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) electrocatalyst is developed. Bi-phase Ni12P5-Ni(4)Nb(5)P(4)nanocrystals with rich heterointerfaces and phase edges are successfully fabricated on carbon cloth (CC), which is enabled by intentional defect creation by atmospheric pressure dielectric barrier discharge (DBD) plasma (PCC). The obtained Ni12P5-Ni4Nb5P4/PCC electrocatalyst exhibits excellent HER performance, heralded by the low overpotentials of 81 and 287 mV for delivering current densities of 10 (j(10)) and 500 (j(500)) mA cm(-2), respectively. Meanwhile, the Ni12P5-Ni4Nb5P4/PCC maintains spectacular catalytic activity at high current density region (>j(615)), which outperformed the industry-relevant benchmark Pt/C/PCC catalyst. The catalyst grown on the plasma-treated support shows remarkably longer operation and ultra-stable electrocatalytic characteristics over 100 h continuous operation. Ab initio numerical simulations reveal that Ni atoms exposed in the heterointerfaces act as the main catalytically active centers for HER.									26	2	0	0	3	0	27			1613-6810	1613-6829		WOS:000574114100001	33006209

Levamisole effect on natural cytotoxic cells was evaluated by their capacity to lyse HL-60 tumor cells while activity of macrophages was evaluated measuring production of reactive oxygen species and nitric oxide. Results indicate that natural cytotoxic cells activity was significantly increased by 1 mu g/ml levamisole and that higher doses had no effect. On the other hand, reactive oxygen species and nitric oxide production by macrophages was not increased by any of the levamisole doses used and that the higher dose (100 mu g/ml) induced a significant decrease of nitric oxide levels, which might be deleterious for the defensive response of these fish.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0717-6538			WOS:000368564200006

A laboratory-scale denitrifying reactor was adapted from use of nonefficient seeding sludge and was utilized to degrade quinoline and remove the chemical oxygen demand. Stable removal efficiencies were achieved after an adaptation period of six weeks. Both denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis profiling of the 16S rRNA gene V3 region and comparison of the 16S rRNA gene sequence clone libraries (LIBSHUFF analysis) demonstrated that microbial communities in the denitrifying reactor and seeding sludge were significantly distinct. The percentage of the clones affiliated with the genera Thauera and Azoarcus was 74% in the denitrifying reactor and 4% in the seeding sludge. Real-time quantitative PCR also indicated that species of the genera Thauera and Azoarcus increased in abundance by about one order of magnitude during the period of adaptation. The greater abundance of Thauera and Azoarcus in association with higher efficiency after adaptation suggested that these phylotypes might play an important role for quinoline and chemical oxygen demand removal under denitrifying conditions.									128	22	0	0	118	1	149			0168-6496	1574-6941		WOS:000234983100011	16420635	
J	Peng Ya-Jing; Sun Shuang; Liu Wei-Na; Liu Yu-Hui								Initial dynamic response and reaction mechanism of cyclotrimethylenetrinitramine under shock loading								ACTA PHYSICA SINICA				70	15					158202	10.7498/aps.70.20201279				AUG 5 2021	2021	At present, the relative safety of energetic materials exposed to extreme environments is concerned widely. Understanding the initial decomposition mechanism of energetic materials under impact loading is the basis for exploring new energetic materials with high energy and low sensitivity. In this paper, we study the initial dynamic response and reaction mechanism of perfect cyclotrimethylenetrinitramine (RDX) crystal and RDX crystal with a molecular vacancy defect under shock loading by using the multiscale shock technique (MSST) combined with reactive force field (ReaxFF) molecular dynamics method. The RDX perfect supercell and supercell containing a molecular vacancy are constructed to simulate the shock process by using the generalized gradient approximation method in density functional theory and Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof functional. Before loading the shock wave, one NVE ensemble and Berendsen thermostat are used to control the RDX equilibrium process. A multi-scale impact compression is loaded along the crystal A direction. The initial temperature is 300 K and the initial pressure is set to be an atmospheric pressure. The radial distribution functions between main atoms are calculated, and the influences of shock velocity and molecular vacancy defect on shock loading process are analyzed. The evolution of N-NO2 bond and C-N bond with time in RDX perfect crystals and vacancy crystals under shock velocity of 11 km/s are given. As a result, the possible initial decomposition path of perfect RDX crystal and vacancy RDX crystal are the first fracture of N-N2 bond, followed by the cleavage of C-N bond at small shock velocity. The initial reaction of the RDX crystal with a molecule vacancy is earlier than that of the perfect crystal, which indicates that the vacancy crystal is more sensitive to shock and more prone to decomposition. Furthermore, the fracture of C-H bond is possible after the initial cleavage of N-NO2 bond and C-N bond, and then the H atom is transferred to oxygen atom in nitro group, forming HONO. As the shock velocity increases, the number of broken chemical bonds in the two kinds of RDX crystals increases, and the reaction becomes strong. The presence of molecular vacancy defect enhances the activity of N-NO2 bond and makes it easier to break, thus accelerating the initial reaction of the vacancy crystal. The shock velocity and the particle velocity of the RDX crystal are consistent with previous experimental results and theoretical data, which shows the validity of our calculation results.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1000-3290			WOS:000684055300032

Herein, cellulose nanofibrils (CNF), featuring abundant carboxyls and hydroxyls, was employed to deposit cobalt (Co2+) and iron (Fe3+) ions. The Co2+ and Fe3+ ions were dispersed homogeneously and avoided idiopathic aggregation. The generated CoFe nanoparticles were in a well-aligned arrangement on the CNF nanocarbon. Benefiting from this unique structure, active sites were exposed and their catalytic ability was released fully. As a result, the overpotential of the as-synthesized CoFe nanoparticles catalyst (Fe-CoS/NC) was 257 mV to deliver a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) with a Tafel slope of 46.7 mV dec(-1) in 1.0 M KOH electrolyte, outperforming the commercial RuO2 remarkably. The Fe-CoS/NC catalyst exhibited excellent stability, which the overpotential to deliver a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) was only increased by 2.82% after 50 h chronopotentiometry measurement. The nanocarbon framework derived from CNF can not only induce the CoFe nanoparticels into a well-aligned arrangement to fully expose active sites, but also promote the transfer of electrons remarkably, providing a versatile platform for the structural design and a novel strategy to boost OER activity.									9	1	0	0	0	0	9			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000514902000088

The chemical effects of the growing stable region are caused by the equilibrium chemical reaction between silicate and the metallic core. The thermal effects can be characterized by the growth of the sub-isentropic shell, which may have a rapid growth rate compared to that of the chemically stable region. When the present-day CMB heat flow was varied, the origin of the stable region changed from chemical to thermochemical to purely thermal because the rapid growth of the sub-isentropic shell can replace the chemically stable region. Physically reasonable values of the present-day CMB heat flow that can maintain the geodynamo action over 4 billion years should be between 8 and 11 TW. To constrain the thickness of the thermochemically stable region beneath the CMB, the chemical diffusivity is important and should be similar to O (10(-8)) m(2)/s to obtain a thickness of the thermochemically stable region beneath the CMB consistent with that inferred from geomagnetic secular variations (140 km). However, the strength of the stable region found in this study is too high to be consistent with the constraint on the stability of the stable region inferred from geomagnetic secular variations.

However, the utilization of solar energy greatly suffers from its low energy flow density and discontinuous space-time distribution, which are essential for a reasonable energy conversion strategy toward effective storage and utilization. To this end, photocatalytic water splitting is a promising method for utilizing solar light to produce environmentally friendly hydrogen energy; yet, the efficiency needs to be improved. Generally, such processes can be divided into three elementary steps: light absorption, charge separation and migration, and surface redox reaction. The overall performance is determined by the cumulative efficiencies of the above three steps. The construction of cocatalysts is among the extensive efforts taken to improve the solar conversion efficiency. First, the cocatalysts possess higher work function than the semiconductors, and the photogenerated electrons migrate from semiconductor to cocatalysts, thereby promoting the charge separation. Second, cocatalysts usually lower the activation energy and provide abundant surface reactive sites. Particularly, the addition of cocatalysts can remarkably accelerate the four-electron transfer O-2 evolution kinetics, which usually requires much higher overpotential and is often considered as the bottleneck for water splitting. Third, cocatalysts can timely remove the photogenerated charges from the surface of the semiconductor and subsequently inhibit the photocorrosion and improve the stability of the photocatalysts. Moreover, the cocatalysts also retard the backward recombination of H-2 and O-2. In general, cocatalysts for water splitting can be classified into three categories: H-2 evolution cocatalysts, O-2 evolution cocatalysts, and dual cocatalysts. The H-2 evolution cocatalysts mainly contain noble metals such as Pt, Au, and other transition metals such as Co, Ni, and Cu and their phosphides or sulfides, which are capable of trapping electrons and promoting proton reduction. The O-2 evolution cocatalysts are often noble metal oxides and transition metal (hydro)oxides and corresponding phosphates, which are always efficient in adsorbing and dissociating water molecules. To realize the overall water splitting, H-2 evolution cocatalysts and O-2 evolution cocatalysts are often integrated on one photocatalyst, which results in the so-called dual cocatalyst system. Furthermore, the performance of cocatalysts can be improved by modulating the loading amount, morphology, particle size, etc. In addition, composites such as Pt/Ni(OH)(2) cocatalyst can not only provide both H-2 and O-2 evolution sites but also accelerate the intrinsic surface redox kinetics by promoting H2O activation, thus being much more active than the conventional dual cocatalyst system. This review summarizes the important role and design principle of cocatalysts in photocatalytic systems. The construction and functional mechanism of H-2 evolution cocatalyst, O-2 evolution cocatalyst, and dual cocatalysts in overall water splitting photocatalysts are discussed in detail, and the design strategy of new cocatalysts toward water activation is proposed.									43	13	0	0	2	0	43			1000-6818			WOS:000501224400005

In this work, metallic 1T-VS2 nanosheets featuring V2+-doping and plenty of mesopores are synthesized and demonstrated as a superior hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) electrocatalyst. The V2+-doped and mesoporous VS2 nanosheets are evolved from a VS2 center dot NH3 precursor by removing the intercalated NH3 molecules in an acid solution. V2+-doping can significantly increase the vacancies and disorder of VS2 basal planes, while the mesopores can provide plenty of additional edge sites, thereby resulting in abundant defects as active catalytic sites. Owing to the synergistic effects of V2+-doping, the mesoporous structure and metallic conductivity, the as-prepared V2+-doped VS2 nanosheets work as a highly active catalyst for electrochemical water splitting. It delivers striking kinetic metrics of a very low onset potential of 19 mV and a small Tafel slope of 38 mV dec(-1), which are much better than those of the pristine VS2 nanosheets without doping and mesopores. Furthermore, the V2+-doped and mesoporous 1T-VS2 catalyst exhibits excellent long-term stability for 70 h. The present work paves a new way for synergistically increasing active catalytic sites of VS2 nanosheets towards an efficient HER.									28	0	0	0	0	0	28			2052-1553			WOS:000501285400010

The importance of ozone in the chemical oxidation mechanism of graphite by the widely-used Hummers' method has been largely overlooked. Herein we demonstrate that the ozonolysis of graphite leads to the formation of secondary epoxy and peroxymonosulfate ester functional groups arising from a rotationally hindered Criegee intermediate and sulfuric acid, in a strongly favored thermodynamic process. This mechanistic step is followed by formation of adjacent epoxy and hydroxy groups as major functionalities on graphene oxides via a radical process, and leaves a significant amount of unreacted peroxides well above levels previously recognized. The thermal decomposition of graphene releases sulfur oxygen species (SO2 and SO), but does not appear to release ozone even if this reaction pathway is moderately favored thermodynamically. We propose a new structural model for graphene oxide based on detailed chemical and spectroscopic data that provides insight into observed chemical reactivity and physical properties, including the antimicrobial activity and protein deactivation.

The photocatalytic activity of the as-prepared composites was evaluated by detecting the variation in rhodamine B (RhB) concentration under visible light irradiation. The results show that the composite exhibits much higher photocatalytic activity than bare g-C3N4, bare BiVO4 or the binary composite of g-C3N4/BiVO4, and that the degradation efficiency of RhB can reach 94.5% within 100 min. The trapping experiments indicate that all three radicals center dot OH, center dot O-2(-) and h(+) contribute to the photocatalytic degradation of RhB, and that center dot OH radicals play the most important role, followed by superoxide anion center dot O-2(-) radicals and finally by holes h(+). The hole scavenger EDTA shows a positive influence on the photocatalytic degradation of RhB; it only takes 30 min to degrade 99.6% of RhB, which is nearly 3.5 times faster than that without EDTA. Moreover, the cycle tests prove that the as-prepared composite photocatalyst has good stability and reusability; after 10 consecutive cycles, no obvious deactivation was observed. It also shows excellent performance in water splitting for hydrogen evolution with overpotential values of -155 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2).									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0925-9635	1879-0062		WOS:000794033000009

The evolution of the electrical measurements under dark and illumination conditions is used to analyze the degradation process during 5300 h and its relationship with the physical mechanisms. The degradation in the efficiency of the solar cells is mainly due to a reduction of short circuit current density (J(SC)) and fill factor (FF) while open circuit voltage (V-OC) is the most stable parameter in all studied conditions. The T-S80 lifetimes for power conversion efficiency (PCE) of samples exposed to nitrogen and air environments and under encapsulation were 990 h, 4 h and 48 h, respectively. The analysis of the PCE decay permits to identify and evaluate the intensity of different degradation mechanisms (intrinsic polymer chemical reactions or by diffused environmental oxygen or water) in the different conditions.

The growth follows a pathway from single atoms to NPs as a function of the oxygen exposure (P-O2 x time). The growth kinetics is modeled by accounting for the autocatalytic combustion of the precursor ligands via a variant of the Finke-Watzky two-step model. Even at relatively high oxygen exposures (<120 mbar s) little to no Pt is deposited after the first cycle and most of the Pt is atomically dispersed. Increasing the oxygen exposure above 120 mbar s results in a rapid increase in the Pt loading, which saturates at exposures >> 120 mbar s. The deposition of more Pt leads to the formation of NPs that can be as large as 6 nm. Crucially, high P-O2 (>= 5 mbar) hinders metal aggregation, thus leading to narrow particle size distributions. The results show that ALD of Pt NPs is reproducible across small and large surface areas if the precursor ligands are removed at high P-O2.									36	3	0	0	2	0	36			1613-6810	1613-6829		WOS:000436168700014	29745008

Reduction in Pt loading and overall catalyst cost, without sacrificing catalytic activity, can be achieved by the synthesis of stable core-shell nanoparticles of transition-metal carbides and Pt. We employ density-functional theory (DFT) calculations to study and contrast the suitability of the alpha and beta phases of tungsten carbide (WC) as support (core) materials for Pt shells. We examine the thermodynamic stability of 1-2 layers of Pt on alpha- and beta-WC surfaces, carefully accounting for the delicate balance between epitaxial mismatch strains and chemical bonding between cores and shells. We also study the effects of alloying beta-WC with Ti to modulate the stability and electronic structure of the core-shell structures. We compare the electronic structures of Pt overlayers supported on alpha-WC and beta-TixW1-xC surfaces and compare their activities for HER using the hydrogen binding energy as a descriptor of catalytic activity. Our studies reveal that moderate Ti doping of the metastable beta-WC phase significantly improves its stability and, with merely two layers of Pt loading, HER activity comparable or superior to Pt(111) can be attained. Overall, our results provide detailed insight into experimental observations of the excellent stability and high catalytic activity of beta-TixW1-xC@Pt core-shell nanoparticles.									8	1	0	0	0	0	8			1463-9076	1463-9084		WOS:000447370600009	30191205

The thin oxide films were prepared at different calcination temperatures. The effect of heat treatment temperature on electrochemically active surface area was investigated by cyclic voltammetry. Stability of the mixed oxide coating during electrolysis was evaluated in 0.5 M NaCl solution using cyclic voltammetry (CV), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy dispersive X-ray analysis (EDX) and potentiodynamic polarization. The changes in voltammetric charge, current density and Tafel slope of cholrine evolution reaction with time were monitored during the electrolysis. The morphology and surface composition of the oxide coated anodes before and after accelerated life test (ALT) were analyzed. Deactivation process of the oxide coated anodes was also studied. High temperature preparation of the coatings can change the deactivation mechanism and improve the anodes stability through the changes in electrochemical porosity. Based on the obtained results, different mechanisms for degradation in electro catalytic activity were discussed.									6	1	1	0	2	0	8			2070-2051	2070-206X		WOS:000326716200014

Synthesis parameters such as film thickness and annealing temperatures and durations were investigated to optimize the PEC performance. A band gap of similar to 2.3 eV and a flat band potential of 0.5 V vs. RHE make Fe2V4O13 a promising photoanode material. Water oxidation was kinetically limited at the surface of Fe2V4O13 film as confirmed by tests in electrolyte with a hole scavenger (Na2SO3). Improved PEC performance was achieved by Mo and W doping because of enhanced carrier densities. The best performance was obtained by 2.5% W-doped Fe2V4O13 films (actual 0.8% W-doped), which efficiently oxidize water to O-2 via photogenerated holes as confirmed by oxygen evolution measurements. Moreover, the Fe2V4O13 photoanode displayed very stable photocurrent under illumination. Due to the suitable band gap and valence band position, Fe2V4O13 is a promising photoanode for solar water splitting. Co-catalyst loading and doping optimization are identified as routes to improve this material's performance further.									40	2	0	0	2	0	40			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000371077300030

Currently, the most efficient electrocatalysts for the HER are Pt-based catalysts (especially commercial Pt/C), but the low abundance and high cost of Pt hinder their widespread application. Herein, we demonstrate that a cobalt molybdenum phosphide nanocrystal coated by a few-layer N-doped carbon shell (CoMoP@C) is an excellent substitute for the HER. CoMoP@ C is prepared by a one-step pyrolysis method on a large scale with polyoxometalate (POM) as a molecular platform. The catalytic activity of CoMoP@C is close to that of commercial 20% Pt/C under pH = 0-1 conditions and superior to that of 20% Pt/C under pH = 2-14 conditions at high overpotential (e. g. eta > 240 mV at pH = 2.2). In real seawater, CoMoP@C exhibits stable HER performance with a high Faradaic efficiency (FE) of 92.5%, while the HER activity of 20% Pt/C dramatically decreases after 4 h. The remarkable HER performance of CoMoP@C should be attributed to the low free energy of H on the central CoMoP crystalline core and the multiple functions of the outer N-doped C shell (especially the strong H+ absorption behavior). This work may provide new options for the design and preparation of promising HER electrocatalysts superior to Pt/C, which can be used directly in seawater.									478	25	0	0	17	1	484			1754-5692	1754-5706		WOS:000396430700012

ASTRONOMY & ASTROPHYSICS				333	3			926	941						MAY 20 1998	1998	Star-to-star abundance variations of C, N, O, Na and Al in globular-cluster red giants have been recently supplemented by the finding that [Mg/Fe] is depleted in stars with extremely large [Al/Fe] (Shetrone 1996a). To find out which of the magnesium isotopes is responsible for the observed depletion of [Mg/Fe] Shetrone (1996b) also undertook an isotopic analysis of Mg and found that it is Mg-24 which is depleted in Al-rich giants. On the other hand, Norris & Da Costa (1995) demonstrated that even in the massive globular cluster omega Cen which has intrinsic spreads in both [Fe/H] and the abundances of the s-process elements, [O/Fe] anticorrelates with [Na/Fe] and [Al/Fe] as in "normal" monometallic clusters. These new spectroscopic results allow us to test current models of stellar evolution and nucleosynthesis, as well as those of the formation and chemical enrichment of globular clusters. In an effort to explain self-consistently these observations we have considered two possibilities: (1) a deep mixing scenario which assumes that in red giants some kind of (extra)mixing transports products of nuclear reactions from the hydrogen burning shell (HBS) to the base of the convective envelope; and (2) a combination of primordial and deep mixing scenarios. It is shown that (1) cannot account for the anticorrelation of [Mg/Fe] vs. [Al/Fe] without additional ad hoc assumptions, among which we identify a strong but still undetected low energy resonance in the reaction Mg-24(p,gamma)Al-25, and episodical increases of the HBS temperature up to the value T approximate to 7410(6) K. In (2) intermediate mass AGE stars are assumed to produce the decreased Mg-24 and increased Mg-25 initial abundances in some globular-cluster law mass stars and Al is synthesized at the expense of Mg-25 in the HBS and transported to the surface of the red giant by extramixing. We discuss advantages and deficiencies of both scenarios and propose some observational tests.									82	0	0	0	0	0	82			0004-6361			WOS:000073953400023

Exploring highly efficient electrocatalysts based on non-precious materials is of great significance to break the dilemma of using noble metal-based materials for large-scale commercial hydrogen production. Currently, studies on nano-structured non-precious electrocatalysts mainly focus on improving the catalytic efficiency and durability. However, conventional methods to synthesize these materials are generally time-consuming and complex, which badly hinder the progress for large-scale applications. Herein, in this study, an ultrasmall-sized CuxO nanoparticle immobilized on porous laser-induced forward transfer (LIFT) graphene dispersed on Ni foam was successfully fabricated via a fast one-step laser deposition method. This fabricated composite exhibited an impressive performance towards the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in 1 M KOH solution. A low overpotential of 149.6 mV was achieved to reach an area current density of 10 mA cm(-2), and a Tafel slope of 157 mV dec(-1) was obtained. A 10 h chronoamperometry test of the as-prepared electrode under a fixed potential showed an ignorable degradation of the HER activity. This study shows the great potential of a facile preparation method of a highly efficient and inexpensive electrocatalyst for scalable hydrogen production.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000674764900001

Clear evidence of the evolutionary conservation of trained immunity in teleost fish is lacking. Given the evolutionary position of teleosts as early vertebrates with a fully developed immune system, we hypothesize that teleost myeloid cells show features of trained immunity common to those observed in mammalian macrophages. These would at least include the ability of fish macrophages to mount heightened responses to a secondary stimulus in a nonspecific manner. We established an in vitro model to study trained immunity in fish by adapting a well-described culture system of head kidney-derived macrophages of common carp. A soluble NOD-specific ligand and a soluble beta-glucan were used to train carp macrophages, after which cells were rested for 6 d prior to exposure to a secondary stimulus. Unstimulated trained macrophages displayed evidence of metabolic reprogramming as well as heightened phagocytosis and increased expression of the inflammatory cytokines il6 and tnf-alpha. Stimulated trained macrophages showed heightened production of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species as compared with the corresponding stimulated but untrained cells. We discuss the value of our findings for future studies on trained immunity in teleost fish.									31	0	0	0	20	0	32			0022-1767	1550-6606		WOS:000471835400023	31127029

Such films can serve as catalysts for the water oxidation reaction. Previous studies showed that the catalytic activity could be controlled by varying the deposition parameters, which influence the formation of MnOx phases and the film composition. Herein the film compositions are investigated in detail, indicating different ratios of MnOx structural phases in the films. All films in the series predominately consist of varying proportions of three MnOx phases-Mn2O3, Mn3O4, and birnessite, while an increase of the average Mn oxidation state in the film is identified when going from basic to acidic conditions during electrodeposition. The contribution of these three phases shows a systematic dependency on the pH during electrodeposition. While no specific single MnOx phase was found to dominate the composition of samples that were previously found to show high catalytic activity, the X-ray spectroscopic results revealed the compositions of those samples prepared under close to neutral conditions to be most sensitive to changes in pH.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			2192-6506			WOS:000440287000022	31950637

However, the intrinsic drawbacks of inferior surface hydrophilicity (related to the absorption and transport of water), weak visible-light adsorption (related to the absorption of photon) and poor charge separation efficiency (related to the active substance that can actually participate in the reaction) seriously limit its photocatalytic efficiency. Herein, LaFeO3 is encapsulated by conductive polyaniline (PANI) aerogel on the surface to simultaneous moderate these deficiencies. The ameliorative surface properties and interface effect between LaFeO3 and PANI result in elevated effects for water adsorption and diffusion, visible-light (photon) adsorption and photo induced carries transfer, and the coated LaFeO3 exhibits improved photocatalytic hydrogen evolution performance under visible light. In addition, after continuously testing, the coated LaFeO3 still shows superior stability with nearly negligible decay. Importantly, this model can enrich to other inorganic oxide based semiconductor to modulate the surface properties and charge transport behaviour, and hence improve the visible light photocatalytic performance.

The evolution of the Ta-4f, C-1s and O-1s XPS core level spectra from the Ta/GO structure under study upon the increase of the annealing temperature was investigated with the reference to the uncovered Ta substrate surface. In the Ta/ GO structure the Ta relative atomic concentration was about 1% at room temperature due to the low porosity of the GO layer while the thermal desorption of the overlayer at the elevated temperatures was accompanied by an increase of the Ta concentration up to 47% at 500 degrees C. The C atoms relative concentration started decreasing after the annealing at 250 degrees C. accompanying the thermal desorption of the GO overlayer. The formation of the TaC compound starting from the 250 degrees C. annealing temperatures was determined. The relative oxygen concentration in the GO thick film was decreased upon increasing the annealing temperature accompanying both the thermal desorption of the GO material and the thermal reduction of the GO film.

However, glasses made of metals, as opposed to metal oxide/sulfides are harder to synthesize, with the challenge increasing with amorphousness. In light of these issues, we calibrate the increase in hydrogen evolution reactivity using the Pd2Ni2P bulk metallic glass composition as a model system. This composition has a good glass -forming ability and is interesting from a catalytic point of view, as Ni and P lie on the opposite leg of the HER volcano plot with respect to Pd. Partially amorphous (PA) Pd2Ni2P alloy displayed a five-fold higher specific electrocatalytic activity on per unit electro-chemical surface area (ECSA) basis compared to its crystalline (C) counterpart. This magnitude of specific electrocatalytic activity, which is on par with that for pure Pd, has been achieved with just 40% of the precious metal, leading to a considerable saving in cost. The homogeneous single-phase structure of the highly electro-active partially amorphous alloy leads to higher electrochemical stability than its polycrystalline counterpart. This finding implies that many compositions ignored traditionally due to their poor electro-catalytic activity or stability can now be reconsidered in amorphous forms, thus expanding the material space of valuable catalysts.

These oxidases catalyze the reduction of oxygen to water at a heme-copper binuclear center. Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy has been used to examine the heme-copper-containing respiratory oxidases of Rhodobacter sphaeroides Ga. This technique monitors the stretching frequency of CO bound at the oxygen binding site and can be used to characterize the oxidases in situ with membrane preparations. Oxidases that have a heme-copper binuclear center are recognizable by FTIR spectroscopy because the bound CO moves from the heme iron to the nearby copper upon photolysis at low temperature, where it exhibits a diagnostic spectrum. The FTIR spectra indicate that the binuclear center of the R. sphaeroides aa3-type cytochrome c oxidase is remarkably similar to that of the bovine mitochondrial oxidase. Upon deletion of the ctaD gene, encoding subunit I of the aa3-type oxidase, substantial cytochrome c oxidase remains in the membranes of aerobically grown R. sphaeroides. This correlates with a second heme-copper oxidase in these membranes revealed by FTIR spectroscopy. When wild-type R. sphaeroides is grown photosynthetically, the chromatophore membranes lack the aa3-type oxidase but have this second heme-copper oxidase. Subunit I of the heme-copper oxidase superfamily contains the binuclear center. Amino acid sequence alignments show that this subunit is structurally very highly conserved among both eukaryotic and prokaryotic species. The polymerase chain reaction was used to show that the chromosome of R. sphaeroides contains at least one other gene that is a homolog of ctaD, the gene encoding subunit I of the aa3-type cytochrome c oxidase. Presumably, this second gene codes for subunit I of the second heme-copper oxidase.									55	0	0	0	48	0	55			0021-9193			WOS:A1992HL27100038	1313003

Herein, a highly efficient hierarchical flower-like CoS2@MoS2 core-shell nanostructured electrocatalyst is fabricated by a two-step strategy, in which MoS2 nanosheets with a layered structure are grown on the CoS2 core supported on carbon paper (CP) and used as hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) electrocatalysts working in the whole pH range (0-14). Remarkably, benefiting from the interface-engineering in this 3D core-shell structure of the electrocatalyst, the optimum CoS2@MoS2/CP catalyst exhibits outstanding HER activity over a wide range of pH values and an overpotential of 69 mV in acidic solution, 145 mV in neutral solution and 82 mV in alkaline solution, respectively, to afford the standard current density of 10 mA cm(-2). Furthermore, it demonstrates superior stability under different pH conditions for at least 48 h. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations are performed to gain further insight into the effect of CoS2@MoS2 interfaces, revealing that the strong interfacial interaction between CoS2 and MoS2 dramatically reduces the Gibbs free energy of hydrogen adsorption and the energy barrier for water dissociation, thus enhancing the electrochemical HER activity in the whole pH range (0-14).									18	2	0	0	0	0	19			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000526890300022	32182327	
J	Sugiura, M; Inoue, Y								Highly purified thermo-stable oxygen-evolving photosystem II core complex from the thermophilic cyanobacterium Synechococcus elongatus having his-tagged CP43								PLANT AND CELL PHYSIOLOGY				40	12			1219	1231		10.1093/oxfordjournals.pcp.a029510				DEC 1999	1999	The carboxyl terminus of the CP43 subunit of photosystem II (PSII) in the thermophilic cyanobacterium, Synechococcus elongatus, was genetically tagged with six consecutive histidine residues to create a metal binding site on the PSII supramolecular complex. The histidine-tagging enabled rapid isolation of an intact cyanobacterial PSII core complex from dodecyl maltoside-solubilized thylakoids by a simple one-step Ni2+-affinity column chromatography. The isolated core complex was in a dimeric form with a molecular mass of about 580 kDa, consisting of five major intrinsic membrane proteins (CP47, CP43, D1, D2 and cytochrome b-559), three extrinsic proteins (33 kDa, 12 kDa, and cytochrome c-550), and a few low molecular mass membrane proteins, and evolved oxygen at a rate as high as 3,400 mu mol (mg Chl)(-1) h(-1) at 45 degrees C with ferricyanide as an electron acceptor. The core complex emitted thermoluminescence B-2-, B-1- and Q-bands arising from S(2)Q(B)(-), S(3)Q(B)(-) and S(2)Q(A)(-) charge recombinations at respective emission temperatures of 45, 38 and 20 degrees C, all of which were higher by about 15 degrees C as compared with those in mesophilic spinach BBY membranes. These results indicated that the isolated core complex well retained the intact properties of thermoluminescence of thermophilic cyanobacterial cells, the deeper stabilization of PSII charge pairs. The isolated complex was extremely stable in terms of both protein composition and function, exhibiting no release of extrinsic proteins, no proteolytic degradation in any of its subunits, accompanied by only a slight (less than 10%) loss in oxygen evolution, after dark-incubation at 20 degrees C for 8 d. These properties of the thermophilic PSII core complex are highly useful for various types of studies on PSII.									150	0	0	0	131	0	152			0032-0781			WOS:000084397300005	10682344

A systematic investigation of structural evolution with annealing revealed a progressive crystallization with concurrent development of mesoporosity and modification of chemical composition with nitridation time. Subsequent performance of as-prepared photocatalysts were evaluated by the degradation of methylene blue under visible light irradiation (lambda > 400 nm). Ta3N5 hollow nanospheres exhibited higher photocatalytic activity than Ta3N5 nanorods or bulk Ta3N5, which can be attributed to their engineered structure as well as the oxygen and nitrogen content.									4	1	0	0	0	0	4			2399-6528			WOS:000476911500003

The physicochemical characterizations showed that the oxidized Pt-x/meso-TiO2 catalysts exhibit high surface area around 200 m(2)/g and Pt nanoparticles having an average size of 3.0 nm are uniformly incorporated into the mesoporous TiO2 matrix with the existence of Pt(II) and Pt(IV) oxidation states. The Pt-x/meso-TiO2 electrocatalysts showed an enhanced electrocatalytic activity with hydrogen evolution onset potential at -10 mV vs. RHE, Tafel slope of -110 mV/dec, small charge transfer resistance, and mass activity that reaches up to 25.7 A/mg(pt) at -300 mV vs. RHE. The hydrogen evolution mass activity of Pt-x/mesoTiO(2) electrocatalysts is significantly more efficient than the commercial Pt/C catalysts and Pt nanoparticles supported on nanostructured carbon substrates. Moreover, the Pt-x/meso-TiO2 electrocatalysts exhibit excellent durability for a 24-hour electrolysis in acid solution with a further current activation during the prolonged electrolysis. The enhanced mass activity and durability are attributed to the substrate mesoporosity, uniform distribution and strong bonding between the oxidized Pt nanoparticles and the TiO2 substrate. These results demonstrate the promise of the mesoporous TiO2 substrate modified with low loading of platinum nanoparticles for energy conversion technologies.

Herein, a nanosheet array electrode of CoSx-Ni3S2/NF was designed by a facile hydrothermal process. Particularly, the obtained electrode was endowed with superhydrophilicity and superaerophobicity, which not only facilitates to the exposure of active sites, but also alleviates the "bubble shielding effect" for gas diffusion. Consequently, the nanosheet array electrode demonstrated excellent full water splitting activities in alkaline condition, which only need a low voltage of 1.63 V to achieve a current density of 100 mA cm(-2) and can keep a long durability for 20 h at 20 mA cm(-2). Additionally, the production of hydrogen powered by the electricity derived from solar and wind energy utilizing the CoSx-Ni3S2/NF as the electrocatalysts in laboratory condition was also simulated.

In this work, the interaction of Ni-MoO2 nanosheets with ionomers and electrolyte cations was investigated. The activity of Ni-MoO2 nanosheets for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) increased when tested in 1 M NaOH compared to 1 M KOH; however, it decreased when tested in 0.01 M KOH compared to 1 M KOH electrolyte. The capacitance minimum associated with the potential of zero free charge (pzfc) was shifted negatively from 0.5 to 0.4 V versus RHE when KOH concentration increased from 0.1 mM to 1 M KOH, suggesting a softening of the water in the double-layer to facilitate the OH- transport and faster kinetics of the Volmer step that lead to improved HER activity. The catalyst interaction with cationic moieties in the anion ionomer (or organic electrolytes) can also be rationalized based on the capacitance minimum, because the latter indicates a negatively charged catalyst during the HER, attracting the cationic moieties leading to the blocking of the catalytic sites and lower HER performance. The HER activity of Ni-MoO2 nanosheets is lower in benzyltrimethylammonium hydroxide (BTMAOH) than in tetramethylammonium hydroxide (TMAOH). Anion fumion ionomer and electrolytes with organic cations with benzyl group adsorption (such as BTMAOH) lead to decreased HER activity in comparison with TMAOH and Nafion. By utilizing Ni-MoO2 nanosheet electrodes as a cathode in a full non-platinum group metal (PGM) AEM electrolyzer, a current density of 1.15 A/cm(2) at 2 V cell voltage in 1 M KOH at 50 degrees C was achieved. The electrolyzer showed exceptional stability in 0.1 M KOH for 65 h at 0.5 A/cm(2).									13	0	0	0	1	0	13			2574-0962			WOS:000644737800038	34056552

Copper(II) complexes have recently caught the attention of chemists as catalysts for the 4e(-)/4H(+) water oxidation process. While a copper(IV) intermediate has been proposed as the reactive intermediate species, no spectroscopic signature has been reported so far. Copper(III) ligand radical species have also been formulated and supported by theoretical studies. We found, herein, that the reactivity sequence for the water oxidation with a family of Copper(II) o-phenylene bis-oxamidate complexes is a function of the substitution pattern on the periphery of the aromatic ring. In-situ EPR, FTIR, and rR spectroelectrochemical studies helped to sequence the elementary electrochemical and chemical events leading toward the O-2 formation selectively at the copper center. EPR and FTIR spectroelectrochemistry suggests that ligand-centered oxidations are preferred over metal-centered oxidations. rR spectroelectrochemical study revealed the accumulation of a bis-imine bound copper(II) superoxide species, as the reactive intermediate, under catalytic turnover, which provides the evidence for the O-O bond formation during OER.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			0020-1669	1520-510X		WOS:000671099600027	34137590

Herein, we report a PEC cell of organic-inorganic hybrid perovskite (methylammonium lead iodide, MAPbI(3))-TiO2 nanorod array (TNAs) for efficient and stable hydrogen evolution in aqueous hydrogen iodide (HI) solution. The built-in electric field created across the MAPbI(3)-TiO2 junction is able to efficiently separate the electron-hole pairs photogenerated in MAPbI(3) with electrons quickly injected from MAPbI(3) to TiO2, which are then transported along the one-dimensional TiO2 nanorod channels to the counter electrode to reduce proton to evolve hydrogen. The optimized MAPbI(3)-TNA PEC cell exhibits a high photocurrent density of 1.75 mA cm(-2) at 0.14 V (vs. Ag/AgCl) under AM 1.5G illumination, which is able to stably produce molecular hydrogen at a rate of 33.3 mu mol cm(-2) h(-1) for more than 8 h.

Conventional Li-O-2 cathode with liquid electrolyte is gelated with highly elastic crosslinked polymer and cut into 50-200 mu m granules. The gaps between the packed gel granules efficiently induce oxygen to the inner part of the cathode, leading to even Li2O2 growth in thick cathode. Meanwhile, the elasticity of the polymer chain helps to keep good contact between carbon and Li2O2 nanoparticles, which facilitates the electron transfer and improves the cyclability. Without any catalyst, the granular gel cathode is able to run 170 cycles at a fixed capacity of 1000 mA h g(carbon)(-1), or maintains a specific capacity higher than 10,500 mA h g(carbon)(-1) (12.6 mA h cm(-2)) during 11 cycles of full discharge-charge. Since good contact is the precondition to any electrochemical reaction, our strategy is a general way to enhance the performance of Li-O-2 cathodes.									13	0	0	0	0	0	13			2211-2855	2211-3282		WOS:000430057000037

Ten years later, these ideas have still only been tested with indirect estimates of free radical levels (oxidative stress) subsequent to the action of innate and dietary antioxidants. Here, we measure net superoxide (a selection pressure for antioxidant production) and experimentally manipulate superoxide antioxidation using a synthetic mimetic of superoxide dismutase (SOD), Eukarion 134 (EUK). We then measure the toxic effect of superoxide in terms of DNA erosion and concomitant loss of male breeding coloration in the lizard, Ctenophorus pictus. Control males suffered more DNA damage than EUK males. Spectroradiometry showed that male coloration is lost in relation to superoxide and covaries with DNA erosion; in control males, these variables explained loss of color, whereas in EUK males, the fading of coloration was unaffected by superoxide and unrelated to DNA damage. Thus, EUK's powerful antioxidation removes the erosion effect of superoxide on coloration and experimentally verifies the prediction that colors reflect innate capacity for antioxidation.									21	0	0	0	19	0	21			0014-3820	1558-5646		WOS:000306804100011	22834746

However, an efficient and recyclable heterogeneous catalyst for alkene hydroformylation is extremely in demand in academia and industry. In this study, a sulfated carbon nitride supported rhodium particle catalyst (Rh/S-g-C3N4) was successfully synthesized via an impregnation-borohydride reduction method and applied in the hydroformylation of alkenes. The catalysts were characterized by XRD, FTIR, SEM, TEM, XPS, and nitrogen adsorption. The influence of the sulfate content, pressure of syngas, temperature, and reaction time, as well as the stability of Rh/S-g-C3N4, on the hydroformylation was examined in detail. The delocalized conjugated structure in g-C3N4 can lead to the formation of electron-deficient aromatic intermediates with alkenes. The sulphate g-C3N4 has a defected surface owing to the formation of oxygen vacancies, which increased the adsorption and dispersion of RhNPs on the surface of g-C3N4. Therefore, Rh/S-g-C3N4 exhibited an outstanding catalytic performance for styrene hydroformylation (TOF = 9000 h(-1)), the conversion of styrene could reach 99.9%, and the regioselectivity for the branched aldehyde was 52% under the optimized reaction conditions. The catalytic properties of Rh/S-g-C3N4 were also studied in the hydroformylation of various alkenes and displayed an excellent catalytic performance. Furthermore, the reuse of Rh/S-g-C3N4 was tested for five recycling processes, without an obvious decrease in the activity and selectivity under the optimum reaction conditions. These findings demonstrated that Rh/S-g-C3N4 is a potential catalyst for heterogeneous hydroformylation.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0				2073-4344		WOS:000593624600001

This approach exhibits a super dye adsorption capacity and enhanced photocatalytic efficiency. In focus was the effect of the three-dimensional (3D) GO dopant on the NOI production, which was very high in this system. Namely, the concentration of NOI is up to 1710 ions cm(-3) after 60 min visible light irradiation. Moreover, recycling experiments show that the properties of a TiO2/GO-wood system are stable. The TiO2/GO-treated wood is a healthy, environmentally friendly material which is promising for indoor decoration.									1	2	0	0	0	0	3			0018-3830	1437-434X		WOS:000462742500011		
J	Joshi, Chintan Jagdishchandra; Prasad, Ashok					Joshi, Chintan/0000-0002-9339-2511			Epistatic interactions among metabolic genes depend upon environmental conditions								MOLECULAR BIOSYSTEMS				10	10			2578	2589		10.1039/c4mb00181h				2014	2014	When the effect of the state of one gene is dependent on the state of another gene in more than an additive or a neutral way, the phenomenon is termed epistasis. In particular, positive epistasis signifies that the impact of the double deletion is less severe than the neutral combination, while negative epistasis signifies that the double deletion is more severe. Epistatic interactions between genes affect the fitness landscape of an organism in its environment and are believed to be important for the evolution of sex and the evolution of recombination. Here we use large-scale computational metabolic models of microorganisms to study epistasis computationally using Flux Balance Analysis (FBA). We study what the effects of the environment are on epistatic interactions between metabolic genes in three different microorganisms: the model bacterium E. coli, the cyanobacteria Synechocystis PCC6803 and the model green algae, C. reinhardtii. Prior studies have shown that under standard laboratory conditions epistatic interactions between metabolic genes are dominated by positive epistasis. We show here that epistatic interactions depend strongly upon environmental conditions, i.e. the source of carbon, the carbon/oxygen ratio, and for photosynthetic organisms, the intensity of light. By a comparative analysis of flux distributions under different conditions, we show that whether epistatic interactions are positive or negative depends upon the topology of the carbon flow between the reactions affected by the pair of genes being considered. Thus complex metabolic networks can show epistasis even without explicit interactions between genes, and the direction and the scale of epistasis are dependent on network flows. Our results suggest that the path of evolutionary adaptation in fluctuating environments is likely to be very history dependent because of the strong effect of the environment on epistasis.									6	0	0	0	6	0	6			1742-206X	1742-2051		WOS:000341360200010	25018101

Metal oxide decorated with noble metal nanoparticles has been used for the enhancement of gas detection and exhibits superior sensitivity. Understanding the intrinsic mechanism of the detection and the enhancement mechanism is thus becoming a fundamental issue for the further development of novel metal/oxide compound gas-sensing materials. However, the correlation between the microstructural evolution, the charge transport and the complex sensing process has not yet been directly revealed and its atomic mechanism is still debatable. In this study, an Au/WO(2.7)compound was synthesized and exhibited a strongly enhanced gas sensitivity to many reductive gases, especially H-2. Aberration-corrected environmental transmission electron microscopy was used to investigate the atomic-scale microstructural evolutionin situduring the reaction between H-2 and Au/WO2.7 compound. Swing and sintering processes of the Au particles on the WO2.7 surface were observed under heating and gaseous environments, and no injection of hydrogen atoms was suggested. First principle calculations verified the swing and sintering processes, and they can be explained by the enhancement of H-2 sensitivity.									12	2	0	0	0	0	12			1998-0124	1998-0000		WOS:000555721200002

The arrangement of PSII active redox cofactors insures efficiency of electron transfer within it. Donation of electrons extracted from water by the oxygen evolving complex to plastoquinones requires an additional activation energy. In this paper we present theoretical discussion of the anharmonic fluctuations of the protein-lipid matrix of PSII and an experimental evidence showing that the fluctuations are responsible for coupling of its donor and acceptor side. We argue that the fast collective motions liberated at temperatures higher that 200 K are crucial for the two final steps of the water splitting cycle and that one can distinguish three different dynamic regimes of PSII action which are controlled by the timescales of forward electron transfer, which vary with temperature. The three regimes of the dynamical behavior are related to different spatial domains of PSII.									12	1	0	0	5	0	12			1085-9195	1559-0283		WOS:000247447800007	17652775

The resulting materials were characterized by XRD, XANES, TR-XANES, and TPO and, after calcination, consisted of cubic perovskite for 0.0 <= x <= 0.8 and hexagonal perovskite for x = 1.0. Mn species in the precalcined catalysts were oxidized to Mn3+ for x = 0.0 to 0.6 and to Mn2+ for x = 0.8 and 1.0. After calcination, Mn species were present in a mixed oxidation state of Mn3+/Mn4+, while Sr2+ and La3+ were not altered. TR-XANES and TPO showed that Mn species were oxidized at 210-220 degrees C and formed active perovskites LSM0.4 and LSM0.0 at 580 degrees C and 640 degrees C. This shows that Sr doping can reduce the oxidation temperature of LSMx with 0.2 <= x <= 0.4. However, the concentration of Mn4+ in LSMx is increased which is useful for enhancing their catalytic activity and stability. When tested in an alkaline electrolyte, LSM0.6 containing the optimum Mn4+/Mn3+ ratio promoted the formation of hydroxyl via the oxygen intercalation reaction and exhibited low polarization resistance and the highest catalytic activity for H2O2 reduction.									13	2	0	0	0	1	13			1463-9076	1463-9084		WOS:000378711100020	27271119

The dominant groups are purple sulfur bacteria, purple nonsulfur bacteria, green sulfur bacteria, and green and red filamentous anoxygenic phototrophic bacteria. They represent several bacterial phyla but they all have bacteriochlorophylls and carotenoids and photochemical reaction centers which generate ATP and cellular reductants used for CO2 fixation. They typically have an anaerobic lifestyle in the light, although some grow aerobically in the dark. Some of them oxidize inorganic sulfur compounds for light-dependent CO2 fixation; this ability can be exploited for photobiological removal of hydrogen sulfide from wastewater and biogas. The anoxygenic phototrophic bacteria also perform bioremediation of recalcitrant dyes, pesticides, and heavy metals under anaerobic conditions. Finally, these organisms may be useful for overexpression of membrane proteins and photobiological production of H-2 and other valuable compounds.									11	0	0	0	11	0	13			0724-6145	1616-8542	978-3-319-45651-5; 978-3-319-45649-2	WOS:000395374400007	26907551

To study the feasibility of utilizing herbal medicine wastes (HMWs), pyrolysis of torrefied HMWs was performed. The effects of torrefaction on the properties of products and the evolution law were examined. The results show that the torrefaction temperature exerts a greater influence on the yield and quality of products from HMWs pyrolysis than that of the torrefaction atmosphere. CO was the predominant component in the gas, and its yield increased with both the torrefaction and pyrolysis temperatures. H-2 and CH4 started to be released at >= 600 degrees C due to dehydrogenation and condensation reactions. Acids, ketones and anhydro-saccharides (AS) were the major compounds in bio-oil from 400 to 600 degrees C, while phenols, aromatics and N-containing compounds dominated at high temperatures. Torrefaction at high temperatures and under oxygenated atmospheres facilitated the formation of larger aromatic ring structures. Pyrolysis of torrefied HMWs under CO2 and O-2 and 260 degrees C produced more CO, CO2 and acids but fewer phenols than that under N-2. The obtained results are beneficial for the development of an effective utilization method for HMWs. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

However, the availability of photocatalysts is limited by the low solar energy utilization efficiency and the fast recombination of photogenerated electron-hole pairs. Developing a hollow heterostructure photo-catalyst based on semiconductors for enhancing solar energy utilization and separation efficiency of photo-generated carriers is crucial in the photocatalytic H-2 production reaction. The as-prepared 3D hierarchical nanocages photocatalyst CuS@ZnIn2S4 with abundant and compact nanosheets 2D/2D hetero-interfaces dis -played an improved photocatalytic hydrogen evolution rate as high as 7910 mu mol h(-1) g(-1) in the absence of any cocatalyst. This is the first report of the use of CuS nanosheets-assembled hollow cubic cages to construct 3D hierarchical nanocages photocatalysts. The close distance between the two nanosheet subunits induce the strong interaction, which was advantage to the separation and transfer of charge carriers. In addition, the hollow structure can not only enhance light adsorption, but also suppress photogenerated carrier recombination. The experimental characterizations and theory calculations confirmed that the strong interaction between CuS and ZnIn2S4 2D/2D hetero-interfaces can extremely facilitate the separation of photogenerated charge carriers and accelerate the electrons transfer. The present work provides a feasible method to construct heterojunction photocatalyst for hydrogen evolution via water splitting powered.									11	1	0	0	1	0	10			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000773396200002

However, the regulative mechanism of NDH-1 under stressed conditions is still unclear. In this study, we detected that the NDH-1 activity is partially impaired, but the accumulation of NDH-1 complexes was little affected in the NdhV deleted mutant (Delta ndhV) at low light in cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803. Delta ndhV grew normally at low light but slowly at high light under inorganic carbon limitation conditions (low pH or low CO2), meanwhile the activity of CO2 uptake was evidently lowered than wild type even at pH 8.0. The accumulation of NdhV in thylakoids strictly relies on the presence of the hydrophilic subcomplex of NDH-1. Furthermore, NdhV was co-located with hydrophilic subunits of NDH-1 loosely associated with the NDH-1L, NDH-1MS' and NDH-1M complexes. The level of the NdhV was significantly increased at high light and deletion of NdhV suppressed the up-regulation of NDH-1 activity, causing the lowered the photosynthetic oxygen evolution at pH 6.5 and high light. These data indicate that NdhV is an intrinsic subunit of hydrophilic subcomplex of NDH-1, required for efficient operation of cyclic electron transport around photosystem I and CO2 uptake at high lights.									9	1	0	0	9	0	10			2045-2322			WOS:000378225300002	27329499

MDC technology could be employed to provide freshwater with low-energy input, for example, in remote areas where organic wastes (i.e., urban or industrial) are available. In addition, MDC technology has been proposed as pre-treatment in conventional reverse osmosis plants, with the aim of saving energy and avoiding greenhouse gases related to conventional desalination processes. The use of oxygen reduction (i.e. O-2 + 2H(2)O + 4e(-) -> 4 OH-, E-0 ' = 0.815 V, pH = 7) was usually implemented as cathodic reaction in most of the MDCs reported in literature, whereas other strategies based on liquid catholytes have been also proposed, for example, ferro-ferricyanide redox couple (i.e. Fe(CN)63- + 1e(-) -> Fe(CN)64-, E-0 = 0.37 V). As the MDC designs in the literature and operation modes (i.e., batch, continuous, semi-continuous, etc.) are quite different, the available MDC studies are not directly comparable. For this reason, the main objective of this work was to have a proper comparison of two similar MDCs operating with two different catholyte strategies, and compare performance and desalination efficiencies. In this sense, this study compares the desalination performance of two laboratory-scale MDCs located in two different locations for brackish water and sea water using two different strategies. The first strategy consisted of an air cathode for efficient oxygen reduction, while the second strategy was based on a liquid catholyte with Fe3+/Fe2+ solution (i.e., ferro-ferricyanide complex). Both strategies achieved desalination efficiency above 90% for brackish water. Nominal desalination rates (NDR) were in the range of 0.17-0.14 L center dot m(-2)center dot h(-1) for brackish and seawater with air diffusion cathode MDC, respectively, and 1.5-0.7 L center dot m(-2)center dot h(-1) when using ferro-ferricyanide redox MDC. Organic matter present in wastewater was effectively removed at 0.9 and 1.1 kg COD center dot m(-3)center dot day(-1) using the air diffusion cathode MDC for brackish and sea water, respectively, and 7.1 and 19.7 kg COD center dot m(-3)center dot day(-1) with a ferro-ferricyanide redox MDC.

It is shown that the surface modification with an appropriate amount of orthoboric acid obviously enhances the surface photovoltage responses of g-C3N4, clearly indicating that the separation of photogenerated charges is greatly improved. This is well responsible for the enhanced photocatalytic activities for degrading representative gas-phase acetaldehyde, and liquid-phase phenol. Moreover, it is demonstrated that the amount of O-2 adsorbed on the surfaces of g-C3N4 is greatly increased after H3BO3 modification based on the O-2 temperature-programmed desorption curves. It is suggested that the orthoboric acid modification favors O-2 adsorption to promote the photogenerated electrons captured for improved photocatalytic activities. This work would provide feasible routes to further improve the photocatalytic performance of semiconductors for degrading pollutants. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

On the basis of the mechanistic understanding, graphene overlayers ranging from nanographene clusters to graphene film with 1 ML coverage were prepared in a well-controlled way. O-2 adsorption on the graphene/Ru(0001) surface was investigated by STM, UPS, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). It is revealed that the Ru(0001) surface fully covered by graphene becomes passivated to O-2 adsorption at room temperature and only activated again at elevated temperatures (>500 K). The adsorbed oxygen intercalates between the topmost graphene overlayer and the Ru(0001) substrate surface. These intercalated oxygen atoms decouple the graphene layer from the Ru(0001) substrate, forming quasi-freestanding monolayer graphene atomic crystals floating on the O-Ru(0001) surface.									152	19	0	0	8	0	161			1932-7447			WOS:000265895500047

Fusarium oxysporum LOCK 1134, the strain isolated from brown coal, efficiently biosolubilizes lignite. The obtained liquefied products contain 50% less sulfur and over 99% less mercury than the crude coal. Moreover, the liquefied coal can be modified further by laccase. In this study F oxysporum laccase was expressed in Pichia pastoris for the first time and was assessed as an additional agent for coal degradation. The novel laccase contributes to humic and fulvic acids release from liquefied coal due to introduction of oxygen into coal structure. The effect is increased when a natural redox mediator, sinapic acid, is present in the reaction mixture-up to 30% and 80% respectively. Humic acids obtained by biological process are environmentally friendly fertilizers that may have stimulating effects on crop growth.									16	0	0	0	8	0	16			2191-0855			WOS:000442380500002	30136100

The recombination performance correlated well with the surface Pt metallic state. Alloying cobalt to platinum was observed to produce an electron transfer favouring the occurrence of a large fraction of the Pt metallic state on the catalyst surface. Unsupported PtCo showed both excellent recombination performance and dynamic behaviour. In a packed bed catalytic reactor, when hydrogen was fed at 4% vol. in the oxygen stream (flammability limit), 99.5% of the total H-2 content was immediately converted to water in the presence of PtCo thus avoiding safety issues. The PtCo catalyst was thus integrated in the anode of the membrane-electrode assembly of a polymer electrolyte membrane electrolysis cell. This catalyst showed good capability to reduce the concentration of hydrogen in the oxygen stream under differential pressure operation (1-20 bar), in the presence of a thin (90 mu m) Aquivion. membrane. The modified system showed lower hydrogen concentration in the oxygen flow than electrolysis cells based on state-of-the-art thick polymer electrolyte membranes and allowed to expand the minimum current density load down to 0.15A cm(-2). This was mainly due to the electrochemical oxidation of permeated H-2 to protons that were transported back to the cathode. The electrolysis cell equipped with a dual layer PtCo/IrRuOx oxidation catalyst achieved a high operating current density (3A cm(-2)) as requested to decrease the system capital costs, under high efficiency conditions (about 77% efficiency at 55 degrees C and 20 bar). Moreover, the electrolysis system showed reduced probability to reach the flammability limit under both high differential pressure (20 bar) and partial load operation (5%), as needed to properly address grid-balancing service.									22	1	0	0	0	0	22			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000460495400026

Cyanobacteria, which are thought to be closely related to the evolutionary progenitor of chloroplasts, have a protein homologous to the largest of these, but lack homologues of the smaller ones. Here we report immunological evidence for the occurrence of the 33 kDa extrinsic protein in red and chromophyte algae and its absence from anoxygenic photosynthetic bacteria. The 23 kDa protein was absent from all three groups. The red algal protein was found to be hydrophilic and rather more loosely associated with the thylakoid membrane than its higher plant equivalent. These findings support an origin for all plastids among the oxygenic prokaroytes, in contrast to the phylogeny inferred from ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase-oxygenase sequence data.

Preliminary investigation of its transcriptional level in S. peucetius showed significant expression. Homology modeling and subsequent docking with 7-ethoxycoumarin yielded a reasonable docked structure. cyp107AJ1 cloned into pET28a(+) was expressed in Escherichia coli, and soluble protein was subjected to column-chromatographic purification in order to carry out enzyme assays with 7-ethoxycoumarin. H PLC analysis of the extracted product, corresponding to its LC/MS analysis, showed the dealkylated 7-ethoxycoumarin, which was further established by subsequent GC/MS spectral analysis. We suggest that CYP107AJ1 bypassed the requirement for NAD(P)H and redox partners for generating novel analogues. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.

A similarly prepared classical CeOx/Al2O3 support was used as a reference. Attention is paid to the 1273-1373 K region of treatment, where previous experience demonstrates that this type of material suffers deactivation processes. The structural/morphological characterization of the complex support was performed using X-Ray diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and Raman spectroscopy. Surface and redox properties were also examined using electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) and temperature programmed reduction (TPR). The (Ce,Zr)O-x/Al2O3 sample contains a mixed oxide component that essentially maintains its structural stability after aging treatment under air at 1273 K although an abrupt loss of the structural homogeneity, leading to segregation into two distinct phases, is produced upon aging at 1373 K. Ce-Zr promoter phases detected during the study maintain the t" tetragonal symmetry and display a moderate surface composition evolution ( small with respect to bulk samples) irrespective of the aging treatment. This is attributed to (Ce,Zr)O-x-Al2O3 interactions, which induce beneficial effects on both components, the Ce-Zr promoter and the alumina carrier. TPR experiments show that the aged (Ce,Zr)O-x/Al2O3 materials display a low temperature reduction peak around 650 K, which was previously observed only on activated bulk materials subjected to redox cycling, and may be of importance in the oxygen handling properties of these materials.									40	2	0	0	2	0	41			1463-9076			WOS:000175708800062

Redox stress limits 1,3-dichloprop-1-ene metabolism by Pseudomonas pavonaceae								PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES				368	1616	SI					10.1098/rstb.2012.0377				APR 19 2013	2013	Chlorinated pollutants are hardly biodegradable under oxic conditions, but they can often be metabolized by anaerobic bacteria through organohalide respiration reactions. In an attempt to identify bottlenecks limiting aerobic catabolism of 1,3-dichloroprop-1-ene (1,3-DCP; a widely used organohalide) in Pseudomonas pavonaceae, the possible physiological restrictions for this process were surveyed. Flow cytometry and a bioluminescence reporter of metabolic state revealed that cells treated with 1,3-DCP experienced an intense stress that could be traced to the endogenous production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) during the metabolism of the compound. Cells exposed to 1,3-DCP also manifested increased levels of D-glucose-6-P 1-dehydrogenase activity (G6PDH, an enzyme key to the synthesis of reduced NADPH), observed under both glycolytic and gluconeogenic growth regimes. The increase in G6PDH activity, as well as cellular hydroperoxide levels, correlated with the generation of ROS. Additionally, the high G6PDH activity was paralleled by the accumulation of D-glucose-6-P, suggesting a metabolic flux shift that favours the production of NADPH. Thus, G6PDH and its cognate substrate seem to play an important role in P. pavonaceae under redox stress caused by 1,3-DCP, probably by increasing the rate of NADPH turnover. The data suggest that oxidative stress associated with the biodegradation of 1,3-DCP reflects a significant barrier for the evolution of aerobic pathways for chlorinated compounds, thereby allowing for the emergence of anaerobic counterparts.									42	1	0	0	39	0	42			0962-8436	1471-2970		WOS:000315995300012	23479756

Herein, cocatalyst-free 2D-2D CdS/g-C3N4 step-scheme (S-scheme) heterojunction photocatalysts are fabricated through in situ hydrothermal growth of 2D CdS nanosheets (NSs) on 2D g-C3N4 NSs. The results clearly confirm that the binary CdS/0.7g-C3N4 S-scheme heterojunction shows the best H-2 production rate (15.3 mmol g(-1) h(-1)) without using any cocatalyst, which is 3.83 times and 3060 times higher than those of pure CdS and g-C3N4, respectively. The apparent efficiency of CdS/0.7g-C3N4 at 420 nm is 6.86%. Importantly, the as-prepared CdS/0.7g-C3N4 S-scheme heterojunction has good stability when continuously irradiated for 21 h. The improved stability and activity are attributed to the formation of the S-scheme heterojunction, which can markedly accelerate the interfacial charge separation for surface reaction. It is expected that the design of robust cocatalyst-free CdS/g-C3N4 2D-2D S-scheme heterojunction can become a promising approach to develop the highly active H-2 evolution systems based on various kinds of conventional semiconductor NSs.									148	20	0	0	14	0	149			2367-198X			WOS:000496519600001

Quantities and properties of BB-derived aerosols are difficult to predict due to the complex nature of BB. Near-source conditions, such as oxygen availability and fuel composition, have been identified as influential factors in the properties of aerosol emissions. This work examined the total and size-resolved number and mass aerosol emission factors from dry, pulverized lignocellulosic biomass and its major constituents under laboratory burning conditions to understand the influence of oxygen level and fuel composition on near-source aerosol production. Lignocellulosic biomass and major constituents, including hemicellulose (xylan), cellulose and lignin, were pyrolyzed and combusted in inert and oxidative environments at varying oxygen levels, and the aerosol particle emissions were characterized in terms of size and quantity at a fixed dilution temperature. Fuel mass and fuel heating rate were varied to assess the sensitivity of results to these factors. A previously developed summative model to predict near-source BB aerosol emissions was also tested. Results showed that the total number and mass aerosol emissions decreased with increased oxygen levels. Nucleation mode particles dominated the number emissions in both inert and oxidative environments, but larger aerosol sizes were observed in the oxidative environment. Aerosol particle coagulation and growth were observed at larger fuel masses, indicated by a significant decrease in the total number emission factors in both inert and oxidative environments, while the total mass emission factor only slightly decreased and increased in inert and oxidative environments, respectively. The size of aerosols formed was found to positively correlate with absolute fuel consumption rate, and the effects of oxidation through combustion chemistry and thermal feedback were explored. Good agreement between the simulated and measured number emission factors for pinewood was observed in both the inert and oxidative reaction environments over the range of tested fuel masses. Simulated and measured mass emission factors showed good agreement in the oxidative environment and poorer agreement in the inert environment. Reasons for this discrepancy were explored and the importance of constituent surrogate selection is highlighted.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0021-8502	1879-1964		WOS:000707412500004		
J	Putrenko, II								Induction of luminol chemiluminescence by the manganese cluster of the photosystem II water-oxidizing complex in the S-0, S-1, S-2, and S-3 states								BIOCHEMISTRY				35	9			2865	2871		10.1021/bi9514875				MAR 5 1996	1996	Luminol chemiluminescence (CL) (lambda(max) = 425 nm) induced by the manganese cluster of photosystem II (PSII) (t(max) = 1-5 min) along with CL induced by mono-, di-, or tetranuclear manganese coordination complexes (t(max) = 2-40 s) is observed when either 200 mM sodium phosphate or I M Tris-HCl + 200 mu M EDTA are present in the reaction medium (pH 8.5) containing peroxidase. This light emission is not observed when Tris is used in the reaction medium without EDTA. The yield of a given CL without peroxidase is 5%-20% of that with peroxidase. The peroxidase-dependent CL is inhibited by catalase (I-50 = 0.14-0.17 mu M), while the peroxidase-independent CL is not inhibited by 100 mM ethanol, 1 mM NaN3, 20 mu M Cyt c, or 0.6 mu M catalase. The CL induced by the Mn cluster of the water-oxidizing complex (WOC) in the S-3 or S-2 State exceeds that of lower S states by 15-20-fold, The magnitude of CL induced by Mn complexes is dependent on the ligand type of the complex. The ligand types of the Mn complexes and the WOC in different S states are ranked according to the magnitude of the induced CL: 1,10-phenanthroline > 2,2'-bipyridine > WOC (S-3 or S-2) > hydrotris(pirazolyl) berate > WOC (S-0-2 or S-0, S-1) > 1,4,7-triazacyclononane. It is concluded that CL is caused by H2O2 formed as a result of the oxidation of luminol by triplet molecular oxygen. The Mn cluster of WOC and manganese coordination complexes, acting as catalysts of this reaction, show oxidase activity. Upon S-2-S-3 or S-1-S-2 transition, changes occur in the ligand environment of the Mn cluster of WOC influencing the induction of luminol CL.									3	0	0	0	2	0	3			0006-2960			WOS:A1996TZ11800008	8608122

The use of ultrasonics during precipitation showed potential morphology control during synthesis. The sonication-assisted precipitation with highly aqueous base (20 M NaOH) successfully induced the formation of a one-dimensional nanostructure of CeO2 rods with a homogeneous shape and size (TEM: 24 nm diameter and 129 nm long). A conventional precipitation under the same conditions provided the CeO2 in nonuniform sizes and shapes. Heat treatment (1100 C for 4 h) was required for CeO2 formation when (NH4)(2)C2O4 was used instead of NaOH. The concentration of the precipitation agent (15-20 M) strongly affected the size and shape of the product. Importantly, according to the temperature-programmed reduction/oxidation study, the CeO2 prepared using the sonication-assisted route showed a relatively higher level of reversible oxygen storage capacity (2384 mu mol/g), compared with the CeO2 prepared by conventional route (1748 mu mol/g).									12	0	0	0	1	0	12			1546-542X	1744-7402		WOS:000339051500004

However, such an approach employs expensive noble-metal-based electrocatalysts, which severely undermines its feasibility when implemented on an industrial scale. Herein, based on density functional theory computations and microkinetic modeling, we demonstrate that a novel two-dimensional (2D) material, namely a 1T'-MoTe2 monolayer, can serve as an efficient non-precious electrocatalyst to facilitate the 2e-ORR. The 1T'-MoTe2 monolayer is a stable 2D crystal that can be easily produced through exfoliation techniques. The surface-exposed Te sites of the 1T'-MoTe2 monolayer exhibit a favorable OOH* binding energy of 4.24 eV, resulting in a rather high basal plane activity toward the 2e-ORR. Importantly, kinetic computations indicate that the 1T'-MoTe2 monolayer preferentially promotes the formation of H2O2 over the competing four-electron ORR step. These desirable characteristics render 1T'-MoTe2 a promising candidate for catalyzing the electrochemical reduction of O-2 to H2O2.

These phenomena take place at multiple length and time scales and typically include gas-liquid-solid interfaces and capillary phenomena in porous media(1,2). Many biological and living systems have evolved to optimize fluidic transport. However, living things are exceptionally complex and very difficult to replicate(3-5), and human-made microfluidic devices (which are typically planar and enclosed) are highly limited for multiphase process engineering(6-8). Here we introduce the concept of cellular fluidics: a platform of unit-cell-based, three-dimensional structures-enabled by emerging 3D printing methods(9,10)-for the deterministic control of multiphase flow, transport and reaction processes. We show that flow in these structures can be 'programmed' through architected design of cell type, size and relative density. We demonstrate gas-liquid transport processes such as transpiration and absorption, using evaporative cooling and CO2 capture as examples. We design and demonstrate preferential liquid and gas transport pathways in three-dimensional cellular fluidic devices with capillary-driven and actively pumped liquid flow, and present examples of selective metallization of pre-programmed patterns. Our results show that the design and fabrication of architected cellular materials, coupled with analytical and numerical predictions of steady-state and dynamic behaviour of multiphase interfaces, provide deterministic control of fluidic transport in three dimensions. Cellular fluidics may transform the design space for spatial and temporal control of multiphase transport and reaction processes.									42	2	0	0	2	0	44			0028-0836	1476-4687		WOS:000668662100016	34194019

The carbonization of this special CPF has afforded coupled Fe2P and Fe4N nanoparticles embedded in N-doped carbons (Fe2P/Fe4N@N-doped carbons). This CPF serves as an "all in one" precursor of Fe, N, P, and C. The porous property and solid skeleton of the CPF endow Fe2P/Fe4N@N-doped carbons with porous structure and a high degree of graphitization. As a result, Fe2P/Fe4N@Ndoped carbons exhibited highly efficient multifunctional electrocatalytic performance for water splitting and oxygen electroreduction. Typically, Fe2P/Fe4N@C-800, obtained at a heat-treatment temperature of 800 C, showed an ORR half-wave potential of 0.80 V in alkaline media and 0.68 V in acidic media, close to that of commercial Pt/C catalysts. Fe2P/Fe4N@C-800 also displayed efficient OER and HER activities, comparable to other phosphide and nitride electrocatalysts. The Fe4N and Fe2P nanoparticles embedded in carbons exert unique catalytic efficiency for water splitting and fuel cells. coupled									93	11	0	0	4	0	99			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000412149800047	28872833

The PdPt bimetallic alloys have long gotten considerable interest as to be the most promising electrocatalysts for DEFCs, yet the ways to boost their electrocatalytic activity are still needed to be investigated comprehensively. Herein, it was aimed to boost the electrocatalytic activity and long-term stability of PdPt electrocatalyst towards ethanol oxidation reaction (EOR), besides forecasting the performance of the catalyst by means of the artificial neural network (ANN) approach. In this regard, zirconium dioxide/multi-walled carbon nanotube (ZrO2/MWCNT) nanohybrid composite was employed as catalyst support to fine-tune the electrical conductivity, enlarge the electrochemically active surface area, and besides oxidize the adsorbed toxic intermediate species on the catalyst surface for preventing poisoning. Moreover, an electrochemical activation approach was implemented to augment the electrocatalytic activity of PdPt-ZrO2MWCNT nanohybrid electrocatalyst. The physicochemical characterizations including X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy with energy dispersive X-ray analysis, and transmission electron microspopy, it was confirmed that the PdPt-ZrO2/MWCNT nanohybrid was successfully fabricated via a facile hydrothermal approach. The electrochemical characterizations in alkaline media suggested that the activation process could significantly improve (ca.200-fold increment in cathodic peak current compared to non-activated one) the electrocatalytic activity of nanohybrid electrocatalyst towards EOR. Moreover, the findings revealed that thanks to its synergistic effect, the activated-PdPt-ZrO2/MWCNT nanohybrid was of great potential to be utilized as an electrocatalyst for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Moreover, artificial neural networks model indicated performance of PdPt-ZrO2/MWCNT nanohybrid as the most suitable catalyst for HER. This research potentially paves the way for the engineering of high-performance carbon composite supported bimetallic nanohybrid electrocatalysts to be exploited in largescale energy applications.(c) 2022 Institution of Chemical Engineers.

In these organisms, nitrogen fixation is confined to the photoperiod and occurs simultaneously with oxygenic photosynthesis. Nitrogenase, the enzyme responsible for biological N-2 fixation, is irreversibly inhibited by oxygen in vitro. How nitrogenase is protected from damage by photosynthetically produced O-2 was once an enigma. Using fast repetition rate fluorometry and fluorescence kinetic microscopy, we show that there is both temporal and spatial segregation of N-2 fixation and photosynthesis within the photoperiod. Linear photosynthetic electron transport protects nitrogenase by reducing photosynthetically evolved O-2 in photosystem I (PSI). We postulate that in the early evolutionary phase of oxygenic photosynthesis, nitrogenase served as an electron acceptor for anaerobic heterotrophic metabolism and that PSI was favored by selection because it provided a micro-anaerobic environment for N-2 fixation in cyanobacteria.									271	4	0	0	232	1	282			0036-8075	1095-9203		WOS:000172240500051	11711677

The role of trifluoroacetic acid on the composition, structure and photocatalytic performance of the prepared catalysts was carefully investigated. The obtained samples displayed laminated porous morphology with nitrogen defects, larger specific surface areas, extended range of spectral response and enhanced electron mobility of charge carriers. Consequently, the optimized catalyst FCN-400 exhibited superb photocatalytic performance and excellent cycling stability for hydrogen evolution. The hydrogen evolution rate over FCN-400 reached 309.3 mu mol/h under visible light irradiation, which is 11.3-fold of that of urea-derived graphitic carbon nitride (27.3 mu mol/h).

For comparison, a state-of-the-art mud-crack commercial Ru0.3Ti0.7O2 coating is used. The compact coating is potentially durable over a long term compared to the mud-crack coating due to the reduced penetration of the electrolyte. Ti L-edge X-ray absorption spectroscopy confirms that a TiOx interlayer is formed between the mud-crack Ru0.3Sn0.7O2 coating and the underlying Ti-substrate due to the attack of the electrolyte. Meanwhile, the compact coating shows enhanced activity in comparison to the commercial coating, benefiting from the nanoparticle-nanoporosity architecture. The dependence of the overall electrode polarization behaviour on the local activity and the bubble evolution behaviour for the Ru0.3Sn0.7O2 coatings with different surface microstructure are evaluated by means of scanning electrochemical microscopy and microscopic bubble imaging.									52	1	0	0	4	1	53			1463-9076			WOS:000303444000025	22531826

Here we partially unzip a multiwall carbon nanotube to synthesize zigzag-edged graphene nanoribbons with a carbon nanotube backbone for electrocatalysis of oxygen reduction in proton exchange membrane fuel cells. Zigzag carbon exhibits a peak areal power density of 0.161 W cm(-2) and a peak mass power density of 520 W g(-1), superior to most non-precious-metal electrocatalysts. Notably, the stability of zigzag carbon is improved in comparison with a representative iron-nitrogen-carbon catalyst in a fuel cell with hydrogen/oxygen gases at 0.5 V. Density functional theory calculation coupled with experimentation reveal that a zigzag carbon atom is the most active site for oxygen reduction among several types of carbon defects on graphene nanoribbons in acid electrolyte. This work demonstrates that zigzag carbon is a promising electrocatalyst for low-cost and durable proton exchange membrane fuel cells.									139	15	0	0	5	0	144			2041-1723			WOS:000445029700010	30232335

Graphitized carbon-supported Ir-Ru alloys with different compositions are employed as RTA catalysts in an acidic polyol solution and are shown to exhibit composition-dependent average crystallite sizes of < 5.33 nm. The adopted approach allows the generation of relatively well-dispersed Ir-Ru alloy nanoparticles on the carbon support without severe agglomeration. The activity of IrRu2/C for the hydrogen oxidation reaction is 1.10 times that of the state-of-the-art Pt/C catalyst. Cell reversal testing by simulation of fuel starvation reveals that the durability of IrRu2/C (similar to 7 h) significantly exceeds that of the conventional Pt/C catalyst (similar to 10 min) and is the highest value reported so far. Thus, the developed Ir-Ru alloy catalyst can be used to fabricate practical RTAs and replace Pt catalysts in the anodes of polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cells.

The highly oxidizing chemistry of water splitting required concomitant evolution of efficient photoprotection mechanisms to safeguard the photosynthetic machinery. The role of flavodiiron proteins (FDPs), originally called A-type flavoproteins or Flvs, in this context has only recently been appreciated. Cyanobacterial FDPs constitute a specific protein group that evolved to protect oxygenic photosynthesis. There are four FDPs in Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 (Flv1 to Flv4). Two of them, Flv2 and Flv4, are encoded by an operon together with a Sll0218 protein. Their expression, tightly regulated by CO2 levels, is also influenced by changes in light intensity. Here we describe the overexpression of the flv4-2 operon in Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 and demonstrate that it results in improved photochemistry of PSII. The flv4-2/OE mutant is more resistant to photoinhibition of PSII and exhibits a more oxidized state of the plastoquinone pool and reduced production of singlet oxygen compared with control strains. Results of biophysical measurements indicate that the flv4-2 operon functions in an alternative electron transfer pathway from PSII, and thus alleviates PSII excitation pressure by channeling up to 30% of PSII-originated electrons. Furthermore, intact phycobilisomes are required for stable expression of the flv4-2 operon genes and for the Flv2/Flv4 heterodimer-mediated electron transfer mechanism. The latter operates in photoprotection in a complementary way with the orange carotenoid protein-related nonphotochemical quenching. Expression of the flv4-2 operon and exchange of the D1 forms in PSII centers upon light stress, on the contrary, are mutually exclusive photoprotection strategies among cyanobacteria.									68	3	0	0	64	0	69			0032-0889	1532-2548		WOS:000331132300024	24367022

In this study, we report in detail the recycling use of discharged Li-AgVO3 primary battery for rechargeable Li-O-2 battery. We demonstrate that the discharged Li-AgVO3 cell, in which metallic silver nanoparticles in-situ generated in the vanadium oxide nanowires cathode efficiently catalyze the oxygen reduction/evolution reactions (ORR/OER), can be resumed as rechargeable Li-O-2 cells when they are exposed at O-2 atmosphere. By controlling the discharge depths, we obtained different cathodes that were composed of vanadium oxide nanowires and silver nanoparticles. As the electrode was discharged to a lower voltage, more silver nanoparticles with larger particle size were distributed on the surface of vanadium oxides, as a result of the sequential reduction of Ag+ to Ag-0 and V5+ to V4+. Specifically, the average size of formed Ag nanoparticles was 15 nm and 70 nm at ceased discharge voltage of 2.9 V and 2.0 V, respectively, while the formation of V4+ was observed at discharge voltage lower than 2.3 V. Electrochemical tests indicated that the Li-O-2 cells assembled with the AgVO3 cathode discharged to 2.3 V (AgVO3-2.3) exhibited the highest specific capacity (9000 mAh center dot g(carbon)(-1)), the lowest overpotential and robust cycling performance (up to 95 cycles at the current density of 300 mA center dot g(carbon)(-1)). The remarkable electrochemical performance of the Li-O-2 battery with the AgVO3-2.3 cathode is attributed to the optimization of amount, size and distribution of generated silver nanoparticles that contribute to high electronic conductivity and abundant active sites for the ORR/OER. A combined analysis of electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy confirmed that the AgVO3-2.3 cathode enables the reversible formation and decomposition of Li2O2 with lower charge transfer resistance on discharge and charge. The results presented here would provide new insight into the promising recycling application of depleted primary Li-AgVO3 batteries in rechargeable high-capacity Li-O-2 batteries.									9	3	0	0	0	0	9			0567-7351			WOS:000402481700009

Use of water as a processing solvent is essential to prevent formation of volatile boron compounds and to synthesize the stoichiometric single phase material by a solution technique. Photocatalytic activity of K3Ta3B2O12 for water splitting was the highest when a stoichiometric amount of lactic acid (LA) with Ta:La = 1:2 was used for preparation of the Ta-peroxo lactate complex. Additionally, activities of K3Ta3B2O12 in the photocatalytic water splitting have been improved when NiO was used as a co-catalyst. The highest photocatalytic hydrogen and oxygen evolution rates exhibited by the materials prepared in this work were H2: 392 mu mol/h and O-2: 192 mu mol/h. (C) 2009 The Ceramic Society of Japan.

Firstly, an unintentional in situ Zr-Fe2O3 (I)) NC photoanode was synthesized, which achieved an optimum photocurrent density of 0.27 mA/cm(2) at 1.0 V vs. RHE but possessed a more positively shifted onset potential than conventionally prepared hematite nanorod photoelectrodes. An optimized amount of aluminum co-doping suppresses the bulk as well as surface defects, which causes a negative shift in the onset potential from 0.85 V to 0.8 V vs. RHE and enhances the photocurrent density of Zr-Fe2O3 (I) NC from 0.27 mA/cm(2) to 0.7 mA/cm(2) at 1.0 V vs. RHE. The electrodeposited Co-Pi modification further reduce the onset potential of Al co-doped Zr-Fe2O3 (I) NC to 0.58 V vs. RHE and yield a maximum photocurrent of 1.1 mA/cm(2) at 1.0 V vs. RHE (1.8 mA/cm(2) at 1.23 V vs RHE). The improved photocurrent at low onset potential can be attributed to synergistic effect of Al co-doping and Co-Pi surface modification. Further, during photoelectrochemical water-splitting, a 137 and 67 mu mol of hydrogen (H-2) and oxygen (O-2) evolution was achieved over the optimum Co-Pi-modified Al-co-doped Zr-Fe2O3 (l) NC photoanode within 6 h. The proposed charge transfer mechanism in optimum Co-Pi-modified Al-co-doped Zr-Fe2O3 (I) NC photoanodes during the photoelectrochemical water splitting was also studied. (C) 2020 Elsevier Inc.

However, the range of metals capable of forming stable MXenes is limited mostly to early transition metals of groups 3-6, making the exploration of properties inherent to mid or late transition metal MXenes very challenging. To circumvent the inaccessibility of MXene phases derived from mid-to-late transition metals, we have developed a synthetic strategy that allows the incorporation of such transition metal sites into a host MXene matrix. Here, we report the structural characterization of a Mo2CTx:Co phase (where T-x are O, OH, and F surface terminations) that is obtained from a cobalt-substituted bulk molybdenum carbide (beta-Mo2C:Co) through a two-step synthesis: first an intercalation of gallium yielding Mo2Ga2C:Co followed by removal of Ga via HF treatment. Extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) analysis confirms that Co atoms occupy Mo positions in the Mo2CTx lattice, providing isolated Co centers without any detectable formation of other cobalt-containing phases. The beneficial effect of cobalt substitution on the redox properties of Mo2CTx:Co is manifested in a substantially improved hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) activity, as compared to the unsubstituted Mo2CTx catalyst. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations attribute the enhanced HER kinetics of Mo2CTx:Co to the favorable binding of hydrogen on the oxygen terminated MXene surface that is strongly influenced by the substitution of Mo by Co in the Mo2CTx lattice. In addition to the remarkable HER activity, Mo2CTx:Co features excellent operational and structural stability, on par with the best performing non-noble metal-based HER catalysts. Overall, our work expands the compositional space of the MXene family by introducing a material with site-isolated cobalt centers embedded in the stable matrix of Mo2CTx. The synthetic approach presented here illustrates that tailoring the properties of MXenes for a specific application can be achieved via substitution of the host metal sites by mid or late transition metals.									149	8	0	0	9	0	149			0002-7863	1520-5126		WOS:000495769300040	31540549

Recently, the metal diselenides have been interested in a broad range of electrochemical applications due to their interesting electrocatalytic performances. Despite the metal diselenides have been widely focused on hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), it is not much focused on electrochemical sensor. For the first time, the bimetallic cobalt-iron diselenide nanosphere entrapped functionalized carbon nanofiber (CoFeSe2/f-CNF) composite have been synthesized by using simple hydrothermal synthesis and used as an electrode material for efficient electrochemical detection of caffeic acid (CA). The functionalization of CNF and the formation of CoFeSe2/f-CNF nanocomposite have been successfully scrutinized by using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy, X-ray powder diffraction, transmission electron microscopy and scanning electron microscopy, energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. In addition, the electrochemical properties of CoFeSe2/f-CNF modified glassy carbon electrode (GCE) towards CA sensing were investigated by using cyclic voltammetry, differential pulse voltammetry and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. As the result of the electrochemical studies, the developed CoFeSe2/f-CNF/GCE sensor exhibits very low detection limit (0.002 mu M) and better sensitivity (2.04 mu A mu M-1 cm(-2)) of CA. And also, CoFeSe2/f-CNF/GCE sensor shows the feasible detection of CA in red wine samples, it reveals the excellent practicability of CoFeSe2/f-CNF/GCE. (c) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

The electron entry-site in subunit II is a mixed-valence dinuclear copper center in enzymes that oxidize cytochrome c. This center has been lost during the evolution of the quinol-oxidizing branch of cytochrome oxidases but can be restored by engineering. Herein we describe the crystal structures of the periplasmic fragment from the wild-type subunit II (CyoA) of Escherichia coli quinol oxidase at 2.5-Angstrom resolution and of the mutant with the engineered dinuclear copper center (purple CyoA) at 2.3-Angstrom resolution. CyoA is folded as an 11-stranded mostly antiparallel beta-sandwich followed by three alpha-helices. The dinuclear copper center is located at the loops between strands beta 5-beta 6 and beta 9-beta 10. The two coppers are at a 2.5-Angstrom distance and symmetrically coordinated to the main ligands that are two bridging cysteines and two terminal histidines. The residues that are distinct in cytochrome c and quinol oxidases are around the dinuclear copper center. Structural comparison suggests a common ancestry for subunit II of cytochrome oxidase and blue copper-binding proteins.									173	0	0	0	88	0	175			0027-8424			WOS:A1995TL42100003	8618822

However, direct application of MOFs is hindered by their poor conductivity and stability. MOF-derived materials, generally obtained by carbonization or phosphidation of MOF crystals at high temperature, suffer inevitably from insufficient exposure of active sites because of the micropore regime of most MOF precursors (<= 3 nm). Here, using CoFe bimetal-organic framework triangular plate arrays (CoFe-MOF TPAs/Ni) as a precursor, we developed a facile strategy to prepare Fe-rich Macroporous CoFeP Triangular Plate Arrays (Macroporous CoFeP TPAs/Ni) as an overall water splitting catalyst. We found that selectively etching organic ligands from CoFe-MOF TPAs/Ni can result in the formation of large interconnected pores in the planes and the follow-up phosphorization can further yield Macroporous CoFeP TPAs/Ni. The obtained Macroporous CoFeP TPAs/Ni exhibit excellent activity towards both the HER and OER in 1 M KOH. Driving HER current densities of 10, 100 and 900 mA cm(-2) requires overpotentials of only 43, 113 and 263 mV, respectively, while delivering OER current densities of 10, 100 and 700 mA cm(-2) needs only 198, 250 and 335 mV, respectively. At a current density of 10 mA cm(-2), the Macroporous CoFeP TPAs/Ni||Macroporous CoFeP TPAs/Ni requires a cell voltage as low as 1.47 V for overall water splitting. The activity and stability of Macroporous CoFeP TPAs/Ni in 1 M KOH are comparable to those of state-of-the-art bifunctional electrocatalysts and even superior to those of noble-metal based ones at large current densities. Furthermore, this strategy can be extended to the synthesis of CoFe-based nitrides, sulfides and selenides. The study provides a promising approach for the development of viable alternatives to noble-metal based materials for industrial water splitting.									75	8	0	0	5	0	77			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000476913600034

However, to the best of our knowledge, most current studies focus only on the charge engineering, the interplay between spin and charge is not well understood, and the simultaneous manipulation of both charge and spin remains challenging. Herein, we show that the cooperative interplay between charge itineration and spin-polarization of electrons has a profound impact on the catalytic behavior through density functional theory (DFT) calculations for the first time. Following this concept, we report a Fe-Ni atomic pair as a superior bifunctional catalyst for high performance ORR and OER, with a very small potential difference (Delta E) of 0.691 V. We confirm that the coexistence of Fe 3d itinerant charge and moderate spin polarization (magnetic moment: 1.48 mu(B)) is responsible for the superior functional catalytic activity for the Fe-Ni atomic pairs.									51	1	0	0	3	0	51			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000623242500001

Herein, we dope NiTi layered double hydroxide (NiTi-LDH) with cobalt to prepare a ternary LDH, CoNiTi-LDH, to enhance its photocatalytic performance towards both water oxidation and hydrogen evolution. A CoNiTi-LDH with smaller plate sizes and a higher degree of order is obtained, which allows the band gap to shrink from 2.7 eV to 2.4 eV. CoNiTi-LDH exhibits a photocatalytic water oxidation activity of 366 mu mol g(-1) h(-1), which is more than two times higher than NiTi-LDH (166 mu mol g(-1) h(-1)). We observed that appropriate energy levels of CoNiTi-LDH allow it to be an efficient photocatalyst also for hydrogen evolution. We performed detailed characterization studies to elucidate the effect of Co-doping on photocatalytic activity.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			2044-4753	2044-4761		WOS:000776940000001

However, the photocatalytic activity of MOFs is greatly limited by the poor conductivity. Herein, a Ti-based MOF (MIL-NH2) are in-situ grown onto layered Ti3C2 MXene, and the latter acts as the Ti source at the same time. The obtained composite (Ti3C2@MIL-NH2) displays superior H-2 evolution performance with a rate as high as 4383.1 mu mol h(-1) g(-1), which is much higher than the other MOF based materials as far as we know. Combined analysis suggests that the Ti atom in Ti3C2 coordinates with the -NH2 group in MIL-NH2. This intimate interfacial contact is crucial for accelerating electron transfer and improving the photo-generated charge separation efficiency.									17	0	0	0	2	0	17			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000626523200001

The catalytic current density of this catalyst film reaches 500 mA cm(-2) at eta = -390 +/- 12 mV and 20 mA cm(-2) at eta = -45 +/- 3 mV, which are significantly higher than the values displayed by Pt foil and Pt/C electrodes in neutral buffer solution and even comparable with the activity of Pt electrode in 0.5 M H2SO4 solution.									40	1	0	0	3	0	40			1614-6832	1614-6840		WOS:000374703900014

Reaction coupling must be sustained in part by biological reworking of Mn-oxide-rich surface sediments into underlying anoxic zones. Surface sediment from Long Island Sound (USA) was used in laboratory experiments to simulate such intermittent natural mixing processes and subsequent reaction evolution. Mixed sediment was incubated anoxically under either diffusively open (plugs) or closed conditions (jars). In closed anoxic incubations, pore water NO3- increased regularly to a maximum (up to 17 mu M) after one to several days, and was subsequently depleted. Mn2+ was produced simultaneously with NO3-. NO2- was also clearly produced and subsequently reduced, with a formation-depletion pattern consistent with coupled nitrification-denitrification in the anoxic sediment. Manipulative additions of Mn-oxides (5-10 mu mol g(-1) net) demonstrated that net anoxic NO3- production correlated directly with initial Mn-oxide content. During initial net NO3- production there was no evidence for SO42- reduction. A direct correlation was also observed between anoxic nitrification rates and estimated sulfate reduction rates; the larger nitrification rates, the larger the eventual net sulfate reduction rates. Diffusively-open incubations using sediment plugs of four different thicknesses (2, 5, 10 and 20 mm) exposed to anoxic overlying water, also showed net production of pore water NO3- (similar to 15-20 mu M) despite the absence of NO3- in the overlying water for at least five days. In general, higher nitrate concentrations were maintained in the open relative to the closed incubations, due most likely to lower concentrations of dissolved reductants for NO3- in the open system. These experiments imply simultaneous coupling between the benthic nitrogen, manganese, and sulfur redox cycles, involving anoxic nitrification and sulfide oxidation to SO42-. Anoxic nitrate production during Mn reduction indicates that nitrification and denitrification can occur simultaneously in subsurface sediments, without vertical stratification. The existence of anoxic nitrification implies new reaction pathways capable of increasing coupled sedimentary nitrification denitrification, particularly in bioturbated or physically mixed deposits.

Modern AT enzymes constitute similar to 2% of all classified enzymatic activities, play central roles in nitrogen metabolism, and generate multitude of primary and secondary metabolites. ATs likely diverged into four distinct AT classes before the appearance of the last universal common ancestor and further expanded to a large and diverse enzyme family. Although the AT family underwent an extensive functional specialization, many AT enzymes retained considerable substrate promiscuity and multifunctionality because of their inherent mechanistic, structural, and functional constraints. This review summarizes the evolutionary history, diverse metabolic roles, reaction mechanisms, and structure-function relationships of the AT family enzymes, with a special emphasis on their substrate promiscuity and multifunctionality. Comprehensive characterization of AT substrate specificity is still needed to reveal their true metabolic functions in interconnecting various branches of the nitrogen metabolic network in different organisms.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0				1083-351X		WOS:000839461200009	35697072

The physicochemical and electrochemical properties of the fabricated membrane were investigated systematically. Results showed that ligand substitution reduced the molecular weight cutoff (MWCO) and pure water flux of UiO-66-X based membranes in the order of -Br > -NO2 > -NH2 due to the size exclusion effect. In addition, compared with UiO-66, UiO-66 functionalized with electron-donating group (-NH2) endowed the electrocatalytic membrane with superior anti-fouling ability using bovine serum albumin (BSA) as model foulant, and inferior tetracycline removal and self-cleaning property, while the opposite phenomenon occurred for the functionalization of electronic-accepting groups (-Br and -NO2) owing to the promoted electrocatalytic activity and inhibited oxygen evolution side reaction. Notably, UiO-66-NO2/Graphite/PVDF membrane removed 99.5 % of tetracycline and flux of fouled membrane was almost fully recovered by electric field for six cycles under low current density of 0.01 mA/cm(2). center dot OH and center dot O-2(-) radicals played dominant roles in tetracycline removal by electrocatalytic membranes and three degradation pathways of tetracycline were proposed according to the liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. Electrically-driven self-cleaning mechanism was related to the reduced fouling potential of BSA after oxidation degradation. This work gets new insights into the effect of ligand substitution on the performance of Zr-MOFs based electrocatalytic membrane for antibiotics removal.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000838722300002

Metallic glasses have recently shown promising performance and large electrochemical surface area in catalytic reactions. The electro-catalytic behavior of recently developed Pt-, Pd-, and Pt/Pd-based metallic glasses was evaluated in this study using scanning electrochemical microscopy. The influence of chemistry and electronic structure on catalytic behavior was studied using scanning kelvin probe technique. The work function for the metallic glasses was lower by 75 mV to 175 mV compared to pure Pt. This resulted in higher catalytic activity for the amorphous alloys, which was attributed to the ease of charge transfer on the surface. The binding energy for the metallic glasses, measured using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, was higher by 0.2 eV to 0.4 eV. This explained easier removal of adsorbed species from the surface of amorphous alloys. The synergistic effect of Pt and Pd in alloys containing both the noble metals was demonstrated towards hydrogen oxidation reaction.									13	1	0	0	0	0	13			2045-2322			WOS:000481747100036	31431678

Hydrogenases catalyze the reversible oxidation of H-2, and are found in many organisms, including plants. One of the cellular effects of H(2)is the selective removal of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and reactive nitrogen species (RNS), specifically hydroxyl radicals and peroxynitrite. Therefore, the function of hydrogenases and the action of H(2)needs to be reviewed in the context of the signalling roles of a range of redox active compounds. Enzymes can be controlled by the covalent modification of thiol groups, and although motifs targeted by nitric oxide (NO) can be predicted in hydrogenases sequences it is likely that the metal prosthetic groups are the target of inhibition. Here, a selection of hydrogenases, and the possibility of their control by molecules involved in redox signalling are investigated using a bioinformatics approach. Methods of treating plants with H(2)along with the role of H(2)in plants is also briefly reviewed. It is clear that studies report significant effects of H(2)on plants, improving growth and stress responses, and therefore future work needs to focus on the molecular mechanisms involved.									10	0	0	0	7	0	10				2223-7747		WOS:000580799000001	32887396

At defect sites, preferential adsorption of reactants and/or formation of chemical species at active sites are observed in heterogeneous catalysis. Understanding the structural response at defect sites during catalytic reactions provides a unique opportunity to exploit defect control of nanoparticle-based catalysts. However, it remains difficult to characterize the strain and defect evolution for a single nanocrystal catalyst in situ. Here, we report Bragg coherent X-ray diffraction imaging of defect dynamics in an individual Pt nanoparticle during catalytic methane oxidation. We observed that the initially tensile strained regions of the crystal became seed points for the development of further strain and subsequent disappearance of diffraction density during oxidation reactions. Our detailed understanding of the catalytically induced deformation at the defect sites and observed reversibility during the relevant steps of the catalytic oxidation process provide important insights of defect control and engineering of heterogeneous catalysts.									14	0	0	0	1	0	14			1530-6984	1530-6992		WOS:000481563800031	31251070

The limit temperatures acceptable for efficient photosynthesis determined by the oxygen evolution of isolated plastids after a 5 min-long heat shock: 47-degrees-C for spinach, and 52-degrees-C for jojoba, were further used for the heat-shock treatment in leaves or isolated plastid fractions. In heat-treated leaves of both plants the amounts of lipids and their specific radioactivities increased during the first 5 min, then decreased with time below the control value (25-degrees-C) in spinach while they remained higher than the control in jojoba. After a 5 min-heat treatment the amount of carotenoids decreased in spinach while beta-carotene increased in jojoba. During a 1 h-heat treatment a gradual labelling of violaxanthin and neoxanthin from beta-carotene occurred in jojoba, while spinach leaves accumulated label only in beta-carotene and lutein. These results suggest that, under a 5 min-long heat stress, a rapid modification of the lipid composition, specially marked by an increase in the monogalactosyldiacylglycerol (MGDG)/digalactosyldiacylglycerol (DGDG) ratio, and a quick labelling of beta-carotene in plastids, occurred in both types of plants. This might correspond to a trigger mechanism for a first structural and functional protection of the reaction centres of photosystems. After a 60 min-long heat treatment, the synthesis of carotenoids by the beta-pathway was stimulated and the efficient structural proportions of MGDG and DGDG were maintained in jojoba plastids, while in spinach the degradation of membrane components occurred.									21	0	0	0	18	0	21			0981-9428			WOS:A1991GV37200017

However, these nanoparticles are not suitable for certain applications (e.g., battery electrodes), where their microparticle (submicron to micron) counterparts are more preferred. Conventional methods used for synthesizing high-entropy nanoparticles often involve various ultrafast shock processes. To increase the size thereby achieving high-entropy microparticles, longer reaction time (e.g., heating duration) is usually used, which may also lead to undesired particle overgrowth or even densified microstructures. In this work, an approach based on Joule heating for synthesizing high-entropy oxide (HEO) microparticles with uniform elemental distribution is reported. In particular, two key synthesis conditions are identified to achieve high-quality HEO microparticles: 1) the precursors need to be loosely packed to avoid densification; 2) the heating time needs to be accurately controlled to tens of seconds instead of using milliseconds (thermal shock) that leads to nanoparticles or longer heating duration that forms bulk structures. The utility of the synthesized HEO microparticles for a range of applications, including high-performance Li-ion battery anode and water oxidation catalyst. This study opens up a new door toward synthesizing high-entropy microparticles with high quality and broad material space.									10	0	0	0	1	0	10			1613-6810	1613-6829		WOS:000745737500001	35049145

The Kalaymyo peridotites consist mainly of harzburgites, which show typical porphyroclastic or coarse-grained equigranular textures. They are composed of olivine (forsterite, Fo = 89.8-90.5), orthopyroxene (enstatite, En(86-91), wollastonite, Wo(1-4), ferrosilite, Fs(8-10); Mg# = 89.6-91.9), clinopyroxene (En(46-49) Wo(47-50) Fs(3-5); Mg# = 90.9-93.6), and spinel (Mg# = 67.1-78.9; Cr# = 13.5-31.5), and have relatively homogeneous whole-rock compositions with Mg#s of 90.1-90.8 and SiO2 (41.5-43.65 wt%), Al2O3 (1.66-2.66 wt%), and CaO (1.45-2.67 wt%) contents. They display light rare earth element (LREE)-depleted chondrite-normalized (CN) REE patterns with (La/Yb)(CN) = 0.04-0.21 and (Gd/Yb)(CN) = 0.40-0.84, and show a slight enrichment from Pr to La with (La/Pr)(CN) in the range of 0.98-2.36. The Kalaymyo peridotites are characterized by Pd-enriched chondrite-normalized PGE patterns with superchondritic (Pd/Ir)(CN) ratios (1.15-2.36). Their calculated oxygen fugacities range between the quartz-fayalite-magnetite (QFM) oxygen buffers, QFM-0.57 and QFM+0.90. These mineralogical and geochemical features collectively suggest that the Kalaymyo peridotites represent residual upper mantle rocks after low to moderate degrees (5%-15%) of partial melting at a mid-oceanic ridge environment. The observed enrichment in LREE and Pd was a result of their reactions with enriched mid-oceanic ridge basalt-like melts percolating through these already depleted residual peridotites. The Kalaymyo and other ophiolites in the Indo-Myanmar Ranges therefore represent mid-oceanic ridge-type Tethyan oceanic lithosphere derived from a downgoing plate and accreted into a westward-migrating subduction-accretion system along the eastern margin of India.									12	2	0	0	0	0	14			1941-8264	1947-4253		WOS:000425248300005		
J	Yoo, Harin; Kahng, Soojin; Kim, Jung Hyeun								Z-scheme assisted ZnO/Cu2O-CuO photocatalysts to increase photoactive electrons in hydrogen evolution by water splitting								SOLAR ENERGY MATERIALS AND SOLAR CELLS				204						110211	10.1016/j.solmat.2019.110211				JAN 2020	2020	Multi-component photocatalysts have been considered as promising candidates to overcome fast charge recombination phenomena in solar water splitting process, which improve electron utilizations in reductive hydrogen generation. However, most reported multi-component systems have been rarely fabricated by aids with z-scheme type components. Thus, cuprous and cupric oxides are proposed as an excellent example for a z-scheme system with ZnO base materials. The ZnO particles are firstly synthesized by a precipitation method, and CuS components are added on the ZnO particle surfaces in various compositions. The ZnO/CuS materials are then thermally treated under controlled oxygen atmosphere to form cuprous and cupric oxides. To enhance photoactive electrons for reductive water splitting in conduction bands of the photocatalyst system, optimum content of cuprous oxides in the z-scheme components is a critical factor. At the optimum cuprous content (14.3%) in the copper oxides, the highest hydrogen production rate of 1092.5 mu molg(-1)h(-1) is achieved at about 3% apparent quantum yield under the standard solar irradiation.									42	0	0	0	6	0	42			0927-0248	1879-3398		WOS:000501656500002

Under steady state WGS, the concentrations of surface formates are strongly limited at high CO conversions. However, at low temperatures and conversions, the formates are close to the equilibrium adsorption/desorption coverages obtained from only CO adsorption. Comparisons at constant temperature indicate that formate bands from IR may provide an indication of the number of active sites present on the catalyst surface, as the rates varied accordingly. The IR results favor a formate intermediate mechanism to explain WGS. However, more kinetic studies are required, and over a broad range of temperatures, to verify this conclusion. Previous low temperature kinetic studies at a relatively high CO/H2O ratios have produced a zero-order dependency for CO and the authors related this to a mechanistic scheme involving reaction of Pt-CO with CeO2 to yield CO2, followed by reoxidation of Ce2O3 by H2O, with liberation of H-2. The zero-order was suggested to be due to saturation of noble metal surface with CO during WGS. Saturation of ceria with carbonates was also reported. In this study, a high H2O/CO ratio was used where the CO rate dependency was first-order. This criteria requires that the surface coverage of the adsorbed CO intermediate should be reaction rate limited. Therefore, the formates are suggested to be the intermediates. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V.

Several attempts have been made in this way, although the influence of the photosensitizer depletion on the optical parameters has not been taken into account so far. We present a first approach to predict the spatio-temporal variation of the photosensitizer absorption coefficient during PDT applied to dermatological diseases, taking into account the photobleaching of a topical photosensitizer. This permits us to obtain the photons density absorbed by the photosensitizer molecules as the treatment progresses and to determine necrosis maps to estimate the short term therapeutic effects in the target tissue. The model presented also takes into account an inhomogeneous initial photosensitizer distribution, light propagation in biological media and the evolution of the molecular concentrations of different components involved in the photochemical reactions. The obtained results allow to investigate how the photosensitizer depletion during the photochemical reactions affects light absorption by the photosensitizer molecules as the optical radiation propagates through the target tissue, and estimate the necrotic tumor area progression under different treatment conditions.

We have analysed major and trace elements, and Sr, Nd and oxygen isotopes for a suite of pyroxenites, which vary in composition and origin, from nine localities (Becvary, Horni Bory, Drahonin, Nihov, Mohelno, Nove Dvory, Horni Kounice, Karlstetten and Meidling-im-Tal) in the Gfohl Unit and Kutna Hora Complex. Based on conventional geothermobarometry, most pyroxenites yield a restricted range of temperatures (similar to 875-975 degrees C) over a wide span of pressures (similar to 1.0-3.0 GPa). The pyroxenite suite exhibits large variations in elemental and isotopic compositions, reflecting its complex origin and evolution. Based on the rare earth element (REE) compositions of clinopyroxene (Cpx), three types of pyroxenite can be distinguished: Type A with a light REE (LREE)-depleted patterns, Type B with an LREE-enriched pattern and Type C with a convex-upward REE pattern. Such REE patterns reflect derivation of the melts from depleted (Type A) and enriched (Types B and C) mantle sources. Pyroxenites from eight localities originated as high-pressure crystal cumulates from transient basaltic melts migrating through the lithospheric mantle. In contrast, pyroxenites at the Becvary locality represent fragments of metamorphosed gabbroic cumulates from oceanic crust. For the pyroxenite suite as a whole, a positive correlation between Sr/Nd and Eu/Eu*, radiogenic Sr-87/Sr-86 and negative epsilon(Nd) values in clinopyroxene, and variable delta O-18 values in coexisting garnet argue for the presence of a crustal component in the parental pyroxenite melts. Variations in compatible elements (Ni, Sc, and Co) indicate that combined assimilation and fractional crystallization was important in the evolution of most of the pyroxenite parental melts, although fractional crystallization alone is recorded by the fragments of oceanic crust, perhaps reflecting their pre-subduction crystallization history.									27	1	0	0	0	0	27			0022-3530	1460-2415		WOS:000380254200003

Oxidation kinetics of C-C-SIC are presented, as well as the incidence of oxidation on the degradation of the microstructure and the tensile strength of the composites. Modelling of the oxidation kinetics allows prediction of mass losses as a function of temperature, thickness of seal-coating, level of mechanical loading, and reactivity of the components toward oxygen. On the basis of this model, it is possible to determine a mechanism controlling the oxidation kinetics, the degradation mode of the composite, and then the evolution of the tensile properties in oxidizing environments. Finally, further improvement in the oxidation resistance of the C-C-SiC composites is discussed, based on a change in the thickness and nature of the SiC seal-coating.									44	13	1	0	1	0	54			0008-6223			WOS:A1995QV56500022

The method of control harmful algal blooms (HABs) by macroalga is an international study issue, and the water extract of seaweed have the advantage of full-time and all-location. While the most study were focused on the level of apparent growth, little was known about the photo-physiological inhibited mechanism in HABs by macroalga. In this study, the thecate dinoflagellate bloom microalga, Scrippsiella trochoidea, was co-cultured with different grams seawater extraction from fresh macroalga Gracilaria lemaneiformis under laboratory conditions photosynthetic oxygen evolution and Chlorophyll fluorescence techniques are used, to study the effects of the seawater extract of Gracilaria lemaneiformis on the photosystem II (PS.) of red tide algae. The results are as follows: Compared with control, the biomass of S. trochoideain 0.6g/L treatment was higher, while the biomass in 1.2g/L, 2.4g/L and 4.8g/L treatment are lower, which shows the pattern of hormesis effect. Photosynthetic oxygen evolution rates (P-max) were decreased with the increase of extract concentration, while the dark respiration rates (Rd) were converse. The J, I, P points in 0.6g/L treatment were higher than the control one, while J, I, P points in 1.2g/L treatment is lower. OJIP curve in 2.4g/L and 4.8g/L tend to be a straight line. The value of Wk, ABC/RC, TRo/RC, DIo/RC, Vj, phi Do and Mo in 2.4g/L and 4.8g/L treatments was increased, while the value of fraction of OEC, phi Po, Fv/Fo, ETo/RC, psi 0, and phi Eo was decreased.The inhibitory effects of the macroalga's sea water extraction on the microalga, according to the JIP-test and pigments contents, include a decrease in the number of active reaction centers, the blocking-up of the electron transport chain. This study suggests that water extraction of G. lemaneiformis is effective in inhibiting photophysiological activity of S. trochoidea, and thus be a potential 'tool alga' for controlling S. trochoidea blooms.					5th International Conference on Energy and Environmental Protection (ICEEP)5th International Conference on Energy and Environmental Protection (ICEEP)	SEP 17-18, 2016SEP 17-18, 2016		Shenzhen, PEOPLES R CHINAShenzhen, PEOPLES R CHINA	0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2352-5401		978-94-6252-253-4	WOS:000390887300102

Differential thermal analysis (DTA) and thermogravimetry (TG) of the individual oxalates and of mixtures of zinc oxalate with either nickel/iron oxalate or products of decomposition of the latter two, were carried out in air in sample cells made of different materials (Pt, Al, Al2O3, Ni). The information gathered from thermoanalytical experiments, together with information derived from specific chemical tests for the evolution of carbon monoxide during decomposition, chemical analyses, XRD and stoichiometric and thermochemical considerations helped to specify some of the inadequately explained features of the courses and kinetics of decomposition of the metal oxalates. Demonstrative evidence strongly indicates that secondary exothermic oxidation of carbon monoxide liberated in situ, takes place at relatively low temperatures in the presence of Pt (sample cell material), NiO and Fe3O4 (decomposition products) which act as catalysts and are reflected in overall exothermic DTA responses that are endothermic in air/oxygen in the absence of catalyst surfaces.

The origin of the unexpected catalytic function of porous BN nanorods was proposed, in which non-radical oxidation driven by the defects on porous BN dominated the sulfamethoxazole degradation via the generation of singlet oxygen (O-1(2)). The adsorption energy between PMS and BN was calculated via density functional theory (DFT), and the PMS activation kinetics were further investigated using an electrochemical methodology. The evolution of O-1(2) was verified by electron spin resonance (ESR) and chemical scavenging experiments. The observed non-radical oxidation presented a high robustness in different water matrices, combined with a series of much less toxic intermediates. The used BN was easily regenerated by heating in air, in which the B-O bond was fully recovered. These findings provide new insights for BN as a non-metal catalyst for organics' degradation via PMS activation, in both theoretical and practical prospects.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000812825100001	35426679

The first step of the process is separation of mg(2+), and Ca2+ ions from seawater by nanofiltration. Next, the NF permeate is dosed into the electrochemical system. There it is completely split into hydrogen and oxygen gases and NaCl precipitate. The electrochemical system comprises an electrochemical cell operated at elevated temperatures (e.g. >= 50 degrees C) and a settling tank filled with aqueous NaOH solution (20-40 %wt) that operates at lower temperatures (e.g. 20-30 degrees C). High concentration of hydroxide ions in the electrolyzed solution prevents anodic chlorine evolution, while the accumulated NaCl precipitates in the settling tank. Batch electrolysis tests, performed in NaCl-saturated NaOH solutions, showed absolutely no chlorine formation on Ni200 and Ti/IrO2-RuO2-TiO2 anodes at [NaOH] > 100 g/kgH(2)O. Three long-term operations (9, 12 and 30 days) of the electrochemical system showed no Cl-2 or chlorate (ClO3-) production on both electrodes operated at current densities of 93-467 mA/cm(2). The Ni200 anode was corroded in the continuous operation that resulted in formation of nickel oxide on the anode surface. On the other hand, the system was successfully operated at 467 mA/cm(2) with TVIrO2-RuO2-TiO2 electrodes in NaCl-saturated solution of NaOH (30 %wt) for 12 days. During this period no formation of Cl-2 and ClO3- has been observed and precipitation of NaCl occurred only in the settling tank. The performance of the system was stable during the operation as indicated by the insignificant fluctuations in the applied cell potentials and measured constant concentrations of NaOH(aq) and NaCl(aq) in the electrolyte solution. During 12 days of operation at approximate to 470 mA/cm(2) about 1.2 m(3) of H-2 and approximate to 150 g of solid NaCl were produced in the system. Electrical energy demand of the electrolysis cell was 5.6-6.7 kWh/m(3)H(2) for the current density range of 187-467 mA/cm(2). (C) 2018 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

However, several reports show that hardly any Ni remains in the layers of the catalysts close to the surface ("Pt-skin effect"). This paradox that Ni is essential to the high catalytic activity with the peak ORR activity at Pt3Ni7 while little or no Ni remains close to the surface is explained here using large-scale first-principles-based simulations. We make the radical assumption that processing Pt-Ni catalysts under ORR conditions would leach out all Ni accessible to the solvent. To simulate this process we use the ReaxFF reactive force field, starting with random alloy particles ranging from 50% Ni to 90% Ni and containing up to similar to 300 000 atoms, deleting the Ni atoms, and equilibrating the resulting structures. We find that the Pt3Ni7 case and a final particle radius around 7.5 nm lead to internal voids in communication with the exterior, doubling the external surface footprint, in fair agreement with experiment. Then we examine the surface character of these nanoporous systems and find that a prominent feature in the surface of the de-alloyed particles is a rhombic structure involving 4 surface atoms which is crystalline-like but under-coordinated. Using density-functional theory, we calculate the energy barriers of ORR steps on Pt nanoporous catalysts, focusing on the O-ad-hydration reaction (O-ad + H2Oad -> OHad + OHad) but including the barriers of O-2 dissociation (O-2ad -> O-ad + O-ad) and water formation (O-Had + H-ad -> H-2Oad). We find that the reaction barrier for the Oad-hydration rate-determining-step is reduced significantly on the de-alloyed surface sites compared to Pt(111). Moreover we find that these active sites are prevalent on the surface of particles de-alloyed from a Pt-Ni 30 : 70 initial composition. These simulations explain the peak in surface reactivity at Pt3Ni7, and provide a rational guide to use for further optimization of improved catalytic and nanoporous materials.									45	3	0	0	3	0	45			2041-6520	2041-6539		WOS:000356176200032	29218162

The physicochemical properties of five CTSS electrodes were characterized by using the scanning electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, X-ray photoelectron spectroscope and electrochemical measurements. The measurement using SEM exhibited the highly porous coralline-like surface morphology of CTSS(glucose) electrode. It is attributed to fewer carboxylic groups in glucose than in other four addition agents. LSV curves showed that the oxygen evolution overpotentials were 2.36 V, 2.29 V, 2.35 V, 2.25 V, and 2.14 V for CTSS(glucose), CTSS(citric acid), CTSS(tartaric acid), CTSS(oxalic acid) and CTS3((nothing)), respectively, indicating that using glucose as addition agent is conductive to electrode preparation for efficient electrocatalytic oxidation of organic wastewaters. The electrocatalytic oxidation removal of methylene blue (MB) was investigated in a 0.5 M H2SO4 and 0.1 M Na2SO4 aqueous solution. The color removal efficiencies after one-hour electrolysis treatment with CTSS(glucose) electrode in this aqueous medium at the current densities of 20, 40, 60 mA cm(-2) were all more than 99%. It was found that the CTSS(glucose) electrode has more sufficient active catalytic sites and a service life of 23 h in an accelerated life test, which is longer than the other CTSS ones. Adding glucose into the electroplate liquid to assemble CTSS electrode did achieve more obvious decolorization.									40	8	0	0	10	0	46			1383-5866	1873-3794		WOS:000413281700051

Herein, 3D porous aerogels comprising ionic liquid (IL) functionalized PdBi SAA building blocks with atomically dispersed Bi on Pd nanowires (IL/Pd50Bi1) are synthesized with accelerated gelation kinetics, which could serve as high-efficiency electrocatalysts for ethanol oxidation reaction (EOR). Benefiting from the unique structures of aerogels including synergistic effects of PdBi SAA nanowire networks and interface engineering, the optimized IL/Pd50Bi1 aerogels display a nearly fourfold enhancement in mass activity and boosted stability for EOR compared to commercial Pd/C. Density functional theory calculations further demonstrate that isolated Bi atoms on Pd nanowire networks decrease the energy barrier of the rate-determining step, resulting in excellent electrocatalytic activity for EOR. This work provides a promising method for developing efficient SAA catalysts for fuel electrooxidation.									35	0	0	0	3	0	35			1616-301X	1616-3028		WOS:000668587200001

In this work, by leveraging the unique superiority of Co-3[Co(CN)(6)](2) (Prussian blue analogues, PBA) precursor, we used Pt4+ to replace partial dispersed Co2+ in Co-3(Co(CN)(6)](2) and a metal-organic framework (MOF) derived PtCo electrocatalyst (MD-PtCo/C) was successfully fabricated. Notably, as-obtained MD-PtCo/C (Pt, 0.9532 wt.%) electrocatalyst achieves high utilization rate of ultra-low Pt load and exhibits favorable electrocatalytic performance with lower onset potential, higher FOR activity, less activation energy (E-a) value and better stability compared to commercial Pt/C for ethanol oxidation reaction (EOR). Moreover, the consequence of concentrations (ICON, C2H5OH) and temperatures on electrocatalytic activity of FOR have also been studied. This study would be supportive of developing highly active and low-cost electrocatalysts for other catalytic applications. (C) 2019 Taiwan Institute of Chemical Engineers. Published by Elsevier B.V.

A major undertaking in this integration is the implementation of pseudopotential functionality into FHI-aims to describe cations at the QM/MM boundary through effective core potentials and therewith prevent spurious overpolarization of the electronic density. Based on numeric atomic orbital basis sets, FHI-aims offers particularly efficient access to exact exchange and second order perturbation theory, rendering the established QM/MM setup an ideal tool for hybrid and double-hybrid level density functional theory calculations of solid systems. We illustrate this capability by calculating the reduction potential of Fe in the Fe-substituted ZSM-5 zeolitic framework and the reaction energy profile for (photo-)catalytic water oxidation at TiO2(110).

The effects of pH in the electrolyte solution on the stability of Li-ion intercalation reaction, the evolution potential of oxygen, and the specific capacity of both the Li-ion intercalated compound and AC electrode materials were intensively investigated by cycling voltammetry and charge/discharge tests in 1 M Li2SO4 solutions with various pH values from pH 7 to 13. LiMn2O4 shows stable Li-ion intercalation in the solution over pH 7, LiCo1/3Ni1/3Mn1/3O2 over pH 11, and LiCoO2 over pH 9. Under optimal conditions, the specific energy, rate capability, and cycling performance of hybrid cells based on the three kinds of positive electrodes and AC negative electrode were compared. There was no significant difference in the specific energy among the three hybrid cells, but the hybrid cell based on the LiMn2O4 showed good cycling life and rate capability. LiCoO2 also had good rate capability but with poor cycling performance, and LiCo1/3Ni1/3Mn1/3O2 showed good cycling life but with poor rate capability.									0	0	0		0	0	0			0013-4651			INSPEC:9011579		
J	Feng, Jizheng; Tang, Ranxiao; Liu, Guofang; Meng, Tao								Regulating d-orbital electronic character and HER free energy of VN electrocatalyst by anchoring single atom								CHEMICAL ENGINEERING JOURNAL				452						139131	10.1016/j.cej.2022.139131				JAN 15 2023	2023	Too strong or too weak orbital electron-coupling with active adsorbents basically results in unsatisfied free energies, and consequently limiting the HER kinetics and activity. Herein, Co-VN catalyst is fabricated to highlight that atomically implanted Co into VN can regulate its d orbital electronic character and corresponding free energy for further improving its alkaline HER performances. Experimental results and density functional theory calculations reveal that atomically implanted Co into VN could induce local charge redispersion to further downshift the d band center position of V-3d in Co-VN. The lowered d band center of the V-3d could not only decrease the d orbital electron-coupling between V site and O atom of OH intermediate to boost desorption of OH species and H2O dissociation kinetics, but also simultaneously balance the hydrogen adsorption free energy to facilitate the desorption of as-formed H2, both of which synergistically increase the Volmer and Heyrovsky ki-netics and overall HER activity of Co-VN. Moreover, the structural stability of Co-VN after long-term HER is also investigated by transmission electron microscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy to uncover its activity -stability trade-off riddle. As a result, Co-VN catalyst expectantly displays a low overpotential of 59 mV at-10 mA cm-2, a small Tafel slope of 46.3 mV dec- 1, and a favorable long-term stability. The proposed regulation strategy of orbital electronic structure and free energy could be extended to design other high-performance catalysts.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000863120600003

This review initially reveals that adjustable components of LDHs control their electronic structures. On the basis of this characteristic, LDHs have emerged as very promising candidates for constructing highly efficient photocatalysts. As a result, 2D LDH-containing heterostructures were prepared according to two strategies: one generated the desired structural configurations, including horizontally and vertically stacked hierarchical heterostructures, and the other comprised band gap engineering with staggered-gap heterojunctions. The heterojunctions that were obtained displayed enhanced photocatalytic activities because of the facilitated transfer of photogenerated carriers and their prolonged lifetime and extended light-response range. Thus, LDH-containing heterostructures exhibited better photocatalytic effects than their individual components in the same applications. Finally, this review provides a brief perspective on the future of the fabrication of LDH-containing heterostructures.									69	7	0	0	11	0	71			2044-4753	2044-4761		WOS:000427157000001

In the present study, we investigated the yet unexplored method of water splitting by femtosecond laser pulses (100 fs, lambda = 800 nm) focused into a quartz cell containing ultra-purified water. As a result of plasma induced radical reactions, the formation of stable products including molecular H-2 and H2O2 was identified and quantified as a function of irradiation time, repetition rate and pulse energies up to 1 mJ. The observed dependencies provided new insight into the basic chemical processes taking place in the plasma generated in water by focused laser pulses. It was found that the energy efficiency of hydrogen production increased with the decrease of pulse energy and repetition rate. Under appropriate irradiation conditions, an advantageous stoichiometry of water decomposition only into pure H-2 and H2O2 (without O-2) was achieved. An original way of process intensification (a series of separate laser beams of adequately low energy generating plasma at different places, a sufficiently fast water flow through the irradiation zones) was proposed in order to improve the energy yield of hydrogen generation and to ensure the evolution of pure hydrogen as the only gaseous product of the water splitting. Taking into account the suggested solution, the predicted energy efficiency of hydrogen production of 0.4 g H-2/kWh was found to be comparable to other plasma methods for H-2 generation. Our results show that direct production of pure H-2 using femtosecond laser pulses is a fully reasonable process that carries considerable potential for both research and application.									13	0	0	0	1	0	14			0306-2619	1872-9118		WOS:000470948200003

In this study, an electrocatalyst of phosphorus doped nickel-cobalt alloy is fabricated for hydrazine oxidation reaction (HzOR). A series of physical and electrochemistry results show that, among as-prepared four electrocatalysts, the NiCoP/C has the lowest Tafel slope, the highest current density, the longest durability and relative low apparent activation energy for HzOR. Moreover, the influences of KOH and N2H4 concentrations, scanning speeds as well as the temperatures as to NiCoP/C electrocatalyst towards HzOR are also investigated. Besides, electrochemical impedance test exhibits as-obtained NiCoP/C owes good charge transfer kinetics.

The impacts of calcination temperature on the surface morphology and electrocatalytic properties of the coatings were investigated by microstructure analysis and electrochemical measurements. The electrochemical properties of the IrO2-ZrO2 binary oxide coatings were found calcination temperature dependent, which could be attributed to the impacts of calcination temperature on the crystallinity, crystallite size and the cracks of the binary oxide coating. With the rise of the calcination temperature, the crystallite size of the active component increased, while the cracks of the coating decreased. The amorphous IrO2-ZrO2 binary oxide coatings were obtained at the calcination temperatures of 350 and 400degC, showing better electrocatalytic activity and lower stability for OER. The active surface area, impacted by the morphology of the binary oxide coating, is calcination temperature dependent. With the rise of calcination temperature, the electrocatalytic activity decreased, while the stability of the IrO2-ZrO2 binary oxide coating for OER increased. Given the electrocatalytic activity and stability of all investigated anodes, the anode calcined at 450degC was considered the most suitable for applications.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0013-4651			INSPEC:18857715

It was found that the anodic polarization curve of Ag in borate buffer solution was characterized by the appearance of two potential regions, active and passive, prior to the oxygen evolution reaction. The active potential region was characterized by the appearance of three anodic peaks, the first two peaks A(1) and A(2) correspond to the oxidation of Ag and formation of [Ag(OH)(2)](-) soluble compound and a passive film of Ag2O on the electrode surface. The third anodic peak corresponds to the conversion of both [Ag(OH)(2)](-) and Ag2O to Ag2O2. X-ray diffraction patterns confirmed the existence of Ag2O and Ag2O2 passive layers on the electrode surface potentiodynamically polarized up to 800 mV. Potentiostatic current transient measurements showed that the formation of Ag2O and Ag2O2 involves a nucleation and growth mechanism under diffusion control. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V.

Understanding this process on the atomic scale and under realistic working conditions is challenging but vital for the rational design of catalysts and photocatalytic decontamination systems. Here we study two highly active C3N4 photocatalysts (bulk C3N4 and a nanosheet-structured C3N4) under simultaneous visible-light irradiation and O-3 bubbling in water by in situ EPR spectroscopy coupled with an online spin trapping technique. The photoexcitation of electrons to the conduction band (CB-e(-)), their further trapping by dissolved O-2 and O-3, and the evolution of reactive oxygen species (ROS) have been semiquantitatively visualized. A dual role of O-3 in boosting the CB-e(-) to (OH)-O-center dot conversion is confirmed: (i) an inlet 2.1 mol % O-3/O-2 gas mixture can trap about 2-3 times more CB-e(-) upon aqueous C3N4 suspension than pure O-2 and further produce (OH)-O-center dot by a robust O-center dot(3)--mediated one-electron-reduction pathway (O-3 -> O-center dot(3)- -> HO3 center dot -> (OH)-O-center dot); (ii) O-3 can readily take CB-e(-) back from O-center dot(3) to form O-center dot(3)-, thus blocking the inefficient H2O2-mediated three-electron-reduction route (O-2 -> O-center dot(2)- -> HO2 center dot H2O2 -> (OH)-O-center dot) but further strengthening the O-center dot(3)--mediated pathway. In the presence of 2.1 mol % O-3/O-2, the (OH)-O-center dot yield increases by 17 and 5 times, and consequently, the mineralization rate constant of oxalic acid increases by 84 and 41 times over bulk C3N4 and NS C3N4, respectively. This work presents an attractive opportunity to boost the yield of ROS species ((OH)-O-center dot) for water purification by visible-light-driven photocatalysis and provides a powerful tool to monitor complex photocatalytic reactions under practical conditions.									97	7	0	0	34	0	99			2155-5435			WOS:000410005700073

In this study, defective and [001] facets engineered TiO2 cathode, i.e. Ti/TiO2-x-001, was prepared for p-NP reduction. In comparison to defective Ti/TiO2 cathode with [101] facets (Ti/TiO2-x-101), the combination of the electron-trapped oxygen vacancy and [001] facets exhibited a synergistic effect to improve the electrochemical reduction efficiency of TiO2. Density functional theory calculations verified that the introduction of [001] facets and electron-trapped oxygen vacancy on TiO2 was beneficial to facilitate electron transfer and improve the indirect reduction efficiency for p-NP electrochemical reduction. Moreover, the electron-trapped oxygen vacancy extent of Ti/TiO2-x-0 01 was modulated by adjusting reduction temperature (250-650 C). The maximum electron-trapped oxygen vacancy amount of Ti/TiO2-x-001 was attained at the reduction temperature of 350 degrees C, which resulted in the highest p-NP reduction efficiency of 99.3%, accompanying the p-AP selectivity of 89.5%. In this case, the abundant active and adsorption sites were provided on the surface of Ti/TiO2-x-001 prepared at 350 degrees C, in which p-NP adsorption coefficient and electrochemical surface area increased to 1.01 L mg(-1) and 25 cm(2), respectively.

In particular, it is easy for MXenes to form composites with other materials such as polymers, oxides, and carbon nanotubes, which further provides an effective way to tune the properties of MXenes for various applications. Not only have MXenes and MXene-based composites come into prominence as electrode materials in the energy storage field as is widely known, but they have also shown great potential in environment-related applications including electro/photocatalytic water splitting, photocatalytic reduction of carbon dioxide, water purification and sensors, thanks to their high conductivity, reducibility and biocompatibility. In this review, we summarize the synthesis and properties of MXenes and MXene-based composites and highlight their recent advances in environment-related applications. Challenges and perspectives for future research are also outlined.									254	16	0	0	25	0	258			2055-6756	2055-6764		WOS:000511441800004

Here we report an uncomplicated post-processing method to construct Ti3+ self-doped titanium-silicon material with corrosion resistance. This is a new experimental method to regulate the electrical, optical, and photocatalytic performances of titanium-containing photocatalysts in a controlled way. Moreover, we demonstrate that TiO-Si materials with different calcination temperatures can serve as a highly efficient and convenient catalyst for photogeneration of hydrogen from water and simulated seawater. Consequently, the optimized Ti-O-Si (400) sample exhibits impressive enhancement in the photocatalytic hydrogen evolution performance, by nearly 10.0 and 43.1 times compared with TiO2 nanoparticles in water and simulated seawater. The Ti-O-Si (400) with substantial Ti3+ and oxygen vacancies exhibits an excellent photocatalytic H-2 production performance due to the improved separation and transmission of the photogenerated electron-hole, the extended visible light response, and corrosion resistance. Our work opens a new door to engineering the intrinsic properties of the titanium-containing materials.									24	1	0	0	3	0	24			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000424075400014	29260813

The results show that SRET is more sensitive for studying not only the uniform corrosion behavior of the Pb-Ag electrodes, but also the localize corrosion of the Pb-Ag electrodes. Under free corrosion conditions, lead corrosion (anodic) zone appeared on the edge of electrode while hydrogen evolution reaction (cathodic) zone appeared on the centre of the specimen. The absolute anodic potential and localize corrosion of the four electrodes decreased with the increase of immersion time. At the end of 10 h of free corrosion condition, the electrode Pb-0.69% Ag alloy displays the best corrosion resistance, followed by the electrodes Pb-0.62% Ag alloy, Pb-0.25% Ag-0.1% Ca alloy and Pb-0.56% Ag alloy. During polarization study and potential decay, the electrode Pb-0.69% Ag alloy had the lowest Quasi Electromotive Force (QEMF), followed by the electrodes Pb-0.62% Ag alloy, Pb-0.25% Ag-0.1% Ca alloy and Pb-0.56% Ag alloy, it means that the electrode Pb-0.69% Ag alloy had the highest corrosion resistance, followed by the electrodes Pb-0.62% Ag alloy, Pb-0.25% Ag-0.1% Ca alloy and Pb-0.56% Ag alloy in the zinc sulfuric acid solution. Also, linear polarization confirms the same trend as that of the SRET.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0304-386X	1879-1158		WOS:000549135400017

For the shrinkage, the apparent activation energy and mechanism were obtained based on the experimental results. It was found that the volume shrinkage highly depended on the reduction temperature and on dwell time. The volume shrinkage of the pellet increased with the increasing reduction temperature, and the rate of increment was fast during the first 20 min of reduction. The shrinkage of the composite pellet was mainly due to the weight loss of carbon and oxygen, the sintering growth of gangue oxides and metallic iron particles, and the partial melting of the gangue phase at high temperature. The shrinkage apparent activation energy was different depending on the time range. During the first 20 min, the shrinkage apparent activation energy was 51,313 J/mol. After the first 20 min, the apparent activation energy for the volume shrinkage was only 19,697 J/mol. The change of the reduction rate-controlling step and the automatic sintering and reconstruction of the metallic iron particles and gangue oxides in the later reduction stage were the main reasons for the aforementioned time-dependent phenomena. The present work could provide a unique scientific index for the illustration of iron ore/carbon composite pellet behavior during solid-state carbothermic reduction.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			2075-4701			WOS:000455072100074

Since that time, the field has rapidly expanded, with research groups from across the world studying dealloying and dealloyed materials. Dealloying has grown into a rich field, with some groups focusing on fundamentals and mechanisms of dealloying, other groups creating new porous metals and alloys, and even more groups studying their properties. Dealloying was originally considered only in the context of corrosion, but now it is considered a facile self-organization technique to fabricate high-surface-area, bicontinuous nanoporous materials. Owing to their high interfacial area and the versatility of metallic materials, nanoporous metals have found application in catalysis, sensing, actuation, electrolytic and ultracapacitor materials, high-temperature templates/scaffolds, battery anodes, and radiation damage-tolerant materials. In this review, we discuss the fundamental materials principles underlying the formation of dealloyed materials and then look at two major applications: catalysis and nanomechanics.									265	6	1	0	14	0	267			1531-7331	1545-4118	978-0-8243-1746-1	WOS:000379330400011

Large amounts of H-2 are produced in a light-dependent reaction for several days when C. reinhardtii cells are deprived of sulfur. Under these conditions, the cells drastically change their physiology from aerobic photosynthetic growth to an anaerobic resting state. The understanding of the underlying physiological processes is not only important for getting further insights into the adaptability of photosynthesis, but will help to optimize the biotechnological application of algae as H-2 producers. Two of the still most disputed questions regarding H-2 generation by C. reinhardtii concern the electron source for H-2 evolution and the competition of the hydrogenase with alternative electron sinks. We analyzed the H-2 metabolism of S-depleted C. reinhardtii cultures utilizing a special mass spectrometer setup and investigated the influence of photosystem II (PSII)- or ribulosebisphosphate-carboxylase/oxygenase (Rubisco)-deficiency. We show that electrons for H-2-production are provided both by PSII activity and by a non-photochemical plastoquinone reduction pathway, which is dependent on previous PSII activity. In a Rubisco-deficient strain, which produces H-2 also in the presence of sulfur, H-2 generation seems to be the only significant electron sink for PSII activity and rescues this strain at least partially from a light-sensitive phenotype. The latter indicates that the down-regulation of assimilatory pathways in S-deprived C. reinhardtii cells is one of the important prerequisites for a sustained H-2 evolution.									153	1	1	0	102	0	157			0032-0935	1432-2048		WOS:000251373400012	17885762

However, the construction of efficient photocatalysts for N-2 reduction is still a significant challenge. Herein, for the first time, we report four kinds of Dawson-type polyoxometalate (POM)-based nitrogen vacancies graphitic carbon nitride (V-g-C3N4) (POM@V-g-C3N4) composite-nanomaterials, which have outstanding photocatalytic N-2 fixation activities under mild conditions. V-g-C3N4 can capture N-2 molecules strongly and accurately. The POMs doped into V-g-C3N4 play a major role in promoting the activation and dissociation of N-2 for the following three reasons: (1) a wide spectrum is established from 200-900 nm to enhance the utilization of light energy. (2) POMs are easily reduced under light conditions, with the advantage of stronger pre-reduction properties, to provide abundant electrons to activate N-2. The reduced POMs further react with oxygen returning to the original POMs, and the reaction forms a self-healing, recyclable photocatalytic N-2-fixing system. (3) The recombination of photogenerated carriers is effectively suppressed and charge-transfer resistance is weakened. Surprisingly, alpha(2)-K8P2W17O61(Co2+center dot OH2)center dot 16H(2)O (P2W17Co)P2W17Co@V-g-C3N4 shows the best photocatalytic N-2 fixation efficiency of 214.6 mu mol L-1 h(-1), which is increased by 91.05% and 95.99% as compared to that of P2W17Co and V-g-C3N4 only. It provides a new view toward the design of sustainable, stable and high-performance photocatalytic N-2 fixation nanomaterials.									18	1	0	0	1	0	18			2052-1553			WOS:000512754200035

Here, we present a fresh look into the superconducting properties of Mo0.3Cu0.7Sr2YCu2O7+delta, with different oxygen contents. These have been attained by two different oxidation techniques and results in samples with a very high hole doping levels in the CuO2 superconducting planes, placing these materials in a greatly doped regime. The evolution of the critical temperature (T-c) with p, reflects the displacement of the superconducting region towards much higher doping levels in comparison with conventional cuprates. Moreover, the normal state transport properties are also displaced, but not in the same extension as the superconducting region, resulting in a different superconducting to normal state correspondence in this Mo0.3Cu0.7Sr2YCu2O7+delta system.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0022-4596	1095-726X		WOS:000525421400019

Herein, a composite porous structure CQDs(10)@NiFe-MOF-A was fabricated via introducing carbon quantum dots (CQDs) into porous NiFe-MOF. The CQDs would make partial loss of lattice in MOF during its growth, leading to the composite building block with the coexistance of crystalline region and amorphous region. The calcining treatment would produce an ultrathin protective layer as well as some lattice collapse. The synergy effect between NiFe ions effectively regulated electronic structure of metal active sites, and successful grafting of CQDs to NiFe-MOF significantly improved electrical conductivity. As expected, the catalyst exhibited outstanding OER performances with high mass activity of 91.6 A/g at overpotential of 300 mV and robust durability of 10,000 cycles in 1 mol/L KOH, which outperformed that of noble catalyst IrO2 of 25.2 A/g. The strategy paves a feasible and effective avenue for the non-noble metal catalysts.

Although the nitrogen sites appear to be more attractive to the incoming Al atoms and the emeraldine and nigraniline films undergo an apparent decrease in intrinsic oxidation state ([=N-]/[-NH-] ratio) as a result of Al deposition, there is no direct interaction between the two species, and the adsorbed oxygen from the bulk of the polymer film plays a dominant role in the interfacial interactions between the polymer and the metal.

Metal concentrations in the prograde fluids were high (up to 1.4 wt% Zn and 1.8 wt% Pb) but remained in solution, likely due to the high temperatures (440?575 ?C) and salinities (35.4?45.3 wt% NaCl equivalent). Absolute concentrations of elements (e.g., Rb and Na) and mass ratios (e.g., Zn/Na and K/Na) reveal that the early, prograde fluids were magmatic, consistent with the oxygen isotope composition of fluids (?18OH2O = 5.5%0?8.5%0). Later mixing with a meteoric fluid caused dilution and Zn-Pb deposition, as revealed by lowered element concentrations and Pb/(Na + K) and Zn/(Na + K) ratios in the sulfide-stage fluid inclusions. Elevated Ca/K ratios in sphalerite-hosted inclusions indicate fluid-carbonate reactions that buffered fluid pH, also facilitating Zn-Pb precipitation. Although cassiterite and molybdenite occur locally at Haobugao, mass balance calculation shows low metal endowment (maximum 2900 t Sn and 2200 t Mo) of the system. Furthermore, the generally unchanged Sn/(Na + K) and Mo/(Na + K) ratios from pre- to late-mineralization fluids suggest that the fluids were never saturated in Sn and Mo. Therefore, finding much Sn or Mo at Haobugao is unlikely. This demonstrates a potential tool for evaluating the metal endowment of a mineral prospect, which may guide exploration.									30	4	0	0	0	0	31			0091-7613	1943-2682		WOS:000640792800024

Electrodes as prepared exhibit a uniform surface with scattered catalyst particles. Characterization and performance of different Sb doping ratios have been compared and discussed. The best Sb doping ratio has been confirmed at 2.5%at. Compared with the Ti/SnO2 electrode, the Ti/Sb (2.5%)-SnO2 electrode exhibited slightly lower oxygen evolution potential with up to three-fold increment for LSV current density, more than two-fold increment for Cdl, a much better electrochemical resistance and 52% longer service life. The accelerated service life of Ti/Sb (2.5%)-SnO2 electrode reaches 22.9 h, which is excellent compared with other studies with complicated manufacture. After 45 min of electrolysis, decolorization efficiency of reactive blue 4 on Ti/SnO2 and Ti/Sb (2.5%)-SnO2 electrodes reaches 94.0% and 96.7%, respectively.

In this capacity, it catalyzes the reversible oxidation of succinate. SdhABCD contains the SDHA protein harboring a covalently bound FAD redox center and the iron-sulfur protein SDHB, containing three distinct iron-sulfur centers. When assembly of this complex is compromised, the flavoprotein SDHA may accumulate in the mitochondrial matrix or bacterial cytoplasm. Whether the unassembled SDHA has any catalytic activity, for example in succinate oxidation, fumarate reduction, reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, or other off-pathway reactions, is not known. Therefore, here we investigated whether unassembled Escherichia coli SdhA flavoprotein, its homolog fumarate reductase (FrdA), and the human SDHA protein have succinate oxidase or fumarate reductase activity and can produce ROS. Using recombinant expression in E. coli, we found that the free flavoproteins from these divergent biological sources have inherently low catalytic activity and generate little ROS. These results suggest that the iron-sulfur protein SDHB in complex II is necessary for robust catalytic activity. Our findings are consistent with those reported for single-subunit flavoprotein homologs that are not associated with iron-sulfur or heme partner proteins.									18	0	0	0	13	0	18				1083-351X		WOS:000437256500024	29610278

Recently, the two-dimensional (2D) bismuth-based nanomaterials emerged as a promising photocatalyst candidate in solar fuel conversion, not only for its exceptional light absorption capability and tunable optical properties, but it also can be synthesized into diverse variety of nanomaterials with different ranges of potential gap and band position to fulfill the potential requirement of wide range of photocatalytic reaction. Yet, the weak light harvesting ability and ultrafast charge recombination has restricted its potential in commercial application. Thus, recent researches have been focusing on tackling these issues by incorporating some modification strategies such as heteroatom doping, vacancy engineering, facet engineering, bismuth rich strategy and heterojunction engineering. Herein, this review article presents the state-of-the-art modifications on 2D bismuth-based parent material, specifically on the relationship between each of the modification strategy on the electronic properties and surface chemistry in achieving boosted photocatalytic performance. In the view of the unique charge interaction between two semiconductors with different dimensions, we systematically discuss the rational heterostructure design from the dimensionality perspective, namely, point-to-face, line-to-face, face-to-face, and bulk-to-face in solar fuel conversion to provide inspiring insights for future interface engineering. Finally, the challenges and the future research outlook in the solar-to-fuel conversion are highlighted to push forward the design of high-performance bismuth-based photocatalyst in realizing commercial-scale solar-to-fuel conversion.									12	1	0	0	1	0	12			1998-0124	1998-0000		WOS:000758993200003

Based on data from over 30aEuro-000 compounds, we show that organic compounds with a wide variety of functional groups fall into molecular corridors, characterized by a tight inverse correlation between molar mass and volatility. We developed parameterizations to predict the saturation mass concentration of organic compounds containing oxygen, nitrogen, and sulfur from the elemental composition that can be measured by soft-ionization high-resolution mass spectrometry. Field measurement data from new particle formation events, biomass burning, cloud/fog processing, and indoor environments were mapped into molecular corridors to characterize the chemical nature of the observed OA components. We found that less-oxidized indoor OA are constrained to a corridor of low molar mass and high volatility, whereas highly oxygenated compounds in atmospheric water extend to high molar mass and low volatility. Among the nitrogen- and sulfur-containing compounds identified in atmospheric aerosols, amines tend to exhibit low molar mass and high volatility, whereas organonitrates and organosulfates follow high O : C corridors extending to high molar mass and low volatility. We suggest that the consideration of molar mass and molecular corridors can help to constrain volatility and particle-phase state in the modeling of OA particularly for nitrogen- and sulfur-containing compounds.									99	1	0	0	25	0	100			1680-7316	1680-7324		WOS:000374702000035

A photoelectrochemical cell consists of a semiconductor photoelectrode in contact with an aqueous electrolyte. Its performance is sensitive to properties of the photoelectrode/electrolyte interface, which may be tuned through functionalization of the photoelectrode surface with organic molecules. This can lead to improvements in the photoelectrode's properties. This Minireview summarizes key computational investigations on using molecular functionalization to modify photoelectrode stability, barrier height, and catalytic activity. It is discussed how first-principles density functional theory, first-principles molecular dynamics, and device modeling simulations can provide predictive insights and complement experimental investigations of functionalized photoelectrodes. Challenges and future directions in the computational modeling of functionalized photoelectrode/electrolyte interfaces within the context of experimental studies are also highlighted.									6	2	0	0	0	0	6			1864-5631	1864-564X		WOS:000471314900008	30693653

Simulated results indicate that upon adsorption the distribution of first-shell PtPt coordination number and radial distribution function change significantly in Pt nanoparticles up to 2 nm in size and that the restructuring degree of the Pt nanoparticles decreases with particle size, which is attributed both to the reduced binding energy per Pt atom bonded to support and to the increased cohesive energy of the Pt nanoparticles. In the Pt-10 particle, the majority of the Pt atoms are detached from the metal particle, leading to atomic adsorption of single Pt atoms on the support. As the Pt particle size is increased to similar to 3 nm, however, the crystalline degree of Pt nanoparticles is even higher than that of the corresponding isolated nanoparticles because the strong metalsupport interaction has a positive effect on the crystalline degree of the upper part of Pt nanoparticles. Two surface properties of the Pt nanoparticles, namely, Pt dispersion and coordination number of surface Pt atoms, are then computed and found to decrease and increase, respectively, with particle size. Thus, on-purpose control of particle size (and hence the metalmetal and metalsupport interactions) is of crucial importance for tuning the superficial structures of supported active metal particles, which eventually determine the adsorption and catalytic properties of catalysts.									17	3	0	0	0	0	18			1932-7447			WOS:000343333600032

Numerous studies reported that rutile TiO2 exhibits low photocatalytic activity, and it is generally accepted that rutile has lower photoactivity than the anatase phase. Herein, we studied the photocatalytic activity of phase-pure rutile TiO2 nanoparticles prepared via microwave-assisted hydrothermal method (MW-R NPs). The syntheses were performed with relatively short reaction time (1- 3h) at 180 degrees C using a microwave digestion system. The samples were characterized in detail and then tested in the photodegradation of methyl orange (MO). We demonstrate that the photodegradation of MO with MW-R NPs is highly efficient in the presence of H2O2. By employing 4.4 mM H2O2, similar to 90% of total decolorization was achieved after 2 min of UV-A irradiation. At the same experimental conditions, MO degradation with Degussa P25 TiO2 was only similar to 7%. The superior photoactivity of MW-R NPs was related to the effective photogeneration of O-2(center dot-) radicals as revealed by EPR investigation. These rutile nanoparticles are excellent photocatalysts in the presence of H2O2, signifying that this oxygen source react easily with the photogenerated holes on the MW-R NPs, and thus the interfacial charge transfer lead to the formation of a large amount of O-2(center dot-) radicals.									14	0	0	0	4	0	15			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000502007800062

Massive and cost-effective production and efficient recovery of carbon-based catalysts are crucial to apply this technology. However, various nanostructured carbons with different dimensions are usually utilized as precursors while not considering their complex preparation procedures and the high costs of ingredients. Moreover, catalyst separation and recovery are not given sufficient attention. In this work, a calcium salt-assisted pyrolysis strategy is proposed to tune the catalytic site formation of carbon-based catalysts. Results show that blending equal amounts of Ca2+ (calcium chloride) and organic precursors could greatly improve the catalytic activity of the carbonated product to activate peroxymonosulfate for pollutant degradation. In addition, the proposed synthetic strategy is universal to most of the readily accessed and cost-effective organic precursors. Singlet oxygen is identified as the main reactive oxidant for pollutant removal in the catalytic reaction. By cross-linking calcium ions and alginate as a hydrogel to immobilize the catalyst, the carbon material could be readily recovered. Furthermore, a long-term continuous-flow reactor test is conducted to validate the effectiveness of applying the immobilized catalyst to treat a synthetic wastewater with 0.5 mM bisphenol A. As a result, a green synthesis and immobilization strategy for persulfate catalysts is successfully established, and the prepared catalyst might be applied for wastewater treatment through using calcium salt in two purposes.									22	0	0	0	13	0	22			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000499740300031	31660719

Two processes were identified, one of which occurs on a time scale of 100 ms to a few seconds and results in oxidation of the catalyst with the formation of an intermediate, here termed [3,4]'. A slower process occurring on the time scale of minutes results in the decay of this intermediate and O-2 evolution. Spectroscopic data suggest that within the fast process there is a short-lived transient intermediate, which is a precursor of [3,4]'. When excess oxidant was used, a highly oxidized form of the blue dimer [4,5] was spectroscopically resolved within the time frame of the fast process. Its structure and electronic state were confirmed by EPR and XAS. As reported earlier, the [3,4]' intermediate likely results from reaction of [4,5] with water. While it is generated under strongly oxidizing conditions, it does not display oxidation of the Ru centers past [3,4] according to EPR and XAS. EXAFS analysis demonstrates a considerably modified ligand environment in [3,4]'. Raman measurements confirmed the presence of the O-O fragment by detecting a new vibration band in [3,4]' that undergoes a 46 cm(-1) shift to lower energy upon O-16/O-18 exchange. Under the conditions of the experiment at pH 1, the [3,4]' intermediate is the catalytic steady state form of the blue dimer catalyst, suggesting that its oxidation is the rate-limiting step.									62	2	0	0	10	0	62			0002-7863			WOS:000301990600038	22332726	
J	Bamwenda, GR; Arakawa, H								The photoinduced evolution of O-2 and H-2 from a WO3 aqueous suspension in the presence of Ce4+/Ce3+								SOLAR ENERGY MATERIALS AND SOLAR CELLS				70	1			1	14		10.1016/S0927-0248(00)00399-8				DEC 2001	2001	This is a report on the production of O-2 and H-2 from photocatalytic and photochemical processes in the WO3-H2O-Ce-aq(4+)-hv system. The photoproduction of O-2 and H-2 was studied over the range of WO, concentrations from 2 to 8 g dm(-3), and conduction band electron scavenger concentrations 1-20mN4 Ce-aq(4+). Medium and high concentrations of the electron scavenger gave mainly O-2 as the main product. Dilute solutions of [Ce-aq(4+)] < 2mM initially produced dioxygen, and then hydrogen after an induction period of 3-4h. Yields of 140-250 mu mol O-2 h(-1) and 1-7 mu mol H-2 h(-1) were obtained and were found to depend on the physical properties and content of WO3, the concentration of the electron scavenger, illumination period and wavelength, and the radiation geometry. The photoactivity of the suspension was correlated to the level of crystallinity of WO3 powders. The studied system utilizes WO3 to accomplish the initial light absorption, charge separation, and production of O-2 and H+ from the interaction of water molecules with photogenerated WO3 valence band holes, in the presence of Ce-aq(4+) species as a scavenger of conduction band electrons. This is followed by the evolution of H, from a homogeneous photochemical reduction of H+ and/or H2O by photoexcited Ce-aq(3+) formed from the earlier reduction of Ce-aq(4+). The obtained results show that, a a with an appropriate design, tungsten trioxide is a promising material that can be used as a photoactive component in energy conversion systems or in environmental photocatalysis, using artificial or solar light.

During the past two decades, scaling relationships have been established for important heterogeneous catalytic reactions. More specifically, a physical or chemical property of the reaction system, termed as a reactivity descriptor, scales with another property often in a linear manner, which can describe and/or predict the catalytic performance. In this Review, we describe scaling relationships and reactivity descriptors for heterogeneous catalysis, including electronic descriptors represented by d-band theory, structural descriptors, which can be directly applied to catalyst design, and, ultimately, universal descriptors. The prediction of trends in catalytic performance using reactivity descriptors can enable the rational design of catalysts and the efficient screening of high-throughput catalysts. Finally, we outline methods to break scaling relationships and, hence, to break the constraint that active sites pose on the catalytic performance.									181	7	0	0	8	0	184			2058-8437			WOS:000500914600006

Many researchers study the influence of temperatures above 0 degrees C instead of below 0 degrees C. Few papers before have explained the relationship between the current-time curve and the morphology of the nanotubes. In this study, the innovative 'oxygen bubble model' and the ionic current and electronic current theories were introduced to explain the growth of nanotubes below 0 degrees C. The length of anodic TiO2 nanotubes at 15 degrees C, 0 degrees C, -10 degrees C were 1.28 mu m, 0.93 mu m and 0.21 mu m, respectively, but the diameter of anodic TiO2 nanotubes was almost the same, at about 164 nm. When the temperature was low, the magnitude of electronic current and the ionic current was small, the mold effect was weak and nanotubes could not be formed. At the same time, this study shows that the dissolution reaction of the field-assisted solution theory has no electron gain or loss, and it has nothing to do with the current, which negates the field-assisted dissolution theory. A novel two-step anodization was used to verify the conclusion. It was found that nanotubes could be obtained when the anodizing current was decreasing or increasing. Also, ginseng-shaped nanotubes are formed at a particular voltage sequence. Based on the 'oxygen bubble model' and the ionic current and electronic current theories, the formation process of nanotubes of two-step anodization is explained clearly.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0				2046-2069		WOS:000732850700001	35424478

Porosity characteristics were determined by analysis of nitrogen adsorption isotherms, and carbons of widely different properties and surface pH values were obtained. Decomposition of H2O2 in dilute unbuffered solution was followed by measuring evolved oxygen volumetrically. First-order kinetics was followed, and the catalytic rate coefficients were evaluated. The carbons tested showed appreciable activity where evolved oxygen attained approximate to 10% of the stoichiometric amount in I h. The degree of decomposition showed inverse dependence on surface area, pore volume and mean pore dimensions. The chemical nature of the surface, rather than the porosity characteristics, was the principal factor in enhancing the disproportionation of H2O2 on the activated carbon surface.

The theory of hypo-hyper-d-interelectronic bonding of transition metal ions and atoms has been employed for selective ordered grafting and shown to stay in the core of the strong metal-support interaction (SMSI) in heterogeneous catalysis and electrocatalysis, and thereby the substantial cause for the improved synergistic activity of composite (electro)catalysts. The same fundament has been the thermodynamic basis for the thermal production of symmetric intermetallic Laves type phases of nanostructured electrocatalysts, in particular the ones with higher oxophilic properties of hypo-d-elements. Remarkably advanced in electrocatalytic activity, highly monatomically dispersed deposits of Pt upon Magneli phases are shown to be unique and highly promising electrocatalysts for the cathodic oxygen reduction (ORR). Nanostructured Au upon a thin nanocrystalline film of anatase titania has been confirmed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) as a typical classical paradigm of the SMSI, and at the same time affording the basis for gold with strained d-orbitals, as the reversible hydrogen electrode. Magneli phases have been shown to be the best electrocatalytic supports with unique properties both for low temperature PEM fuel cells (LT PEM FCs) with pronounced CO tolerance and water electrolysis in membrane type hydrogen generators.									63	1	0	0	0	0	64			1520-6106			WOS:000235560900013	16494305

The importance of various sources in contributing to the OOA loading and associated different ageing mechanisms remains to be elucidated. Here we present a concurrent observation and factorization analysis on the mass spectra of organic aerosol (OA) by a high-resolution aerosol mass spectrometer and volatile organic compounds (VOCs) by a proton transfer reaction mass spectrometer in Wuhan, a megacity in central China, during autumn. The full mass spectra of organics with two principle anthropogenic sources were identified as the traffic and cooking sources, for their primary emission profiles in aerosol and gas phases, the evolutions, and their respective roles in producing OOA and secondary VOCs. Primary emissions in gas and aerosol phases both contributed to the production of OOA. The photooxidation of traffic sources from the morning rush hour caused a 2.5 fold increase in OOA mass in a higher oxidation state (oxygen-to-carbon ratio as O/C = 0.72), co-producing gas phase carboxylic acids, while, at night, cooking aerosols and VOCs (particularly acrolein and hexanal) importantly caused the nocturnal formation of oxygenated intermediate VOCs, increasing OOA mass by a factor of 1.7 (O/C = 0.42). The daytime and nighttime formation of secondary aerosols, as contributed by different sources, was found to be modulated by solar radiation and air moisture, respectively. The environmental policy should, therefore, consider the primary emissions and their respective ageing mechanisms influenced by meteorological conditions.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1680-7316	1680-7324		WOS:000802305300001

Synchronous thermal analysis of samples was carried out in inert (argon) and oxidizing (a mixture of argon and 20 % oxygen) media. The composition of gas thermolysis products was detected mass spectrometrically. The initial salt and solid-phase products of its decomposition were characterised by X-ray phase analysis and Mossbauer spectroscopy. It is well known that the process of thermolysis of iron (III) oxalate under inert atmosphere conditions proceeds in two stages: intermediate decomposition to anhydrous iron (II) oxalate and then the final one to Fe3O4 and alpha-Fe at 150-180 and 310-400 degrees C, respectively. Oxidative thermolysis occurs in a single step. In other words, iron (III) oxide is formed from the initial salt that is later crystallised into hematite phase. However, this step is complex. Instantaneous oxidation of anhydrous iron (II) oxalate formed as an intermediate explains high exothermicity of the process. It was found that the temperature of the initial decomposition step was reduced from 150 to 80 degrees C for a precursor placed into SBA-15 silica matrix pores in both oxidative and inert media. Herewith, the finishing temperature of the step for oxidative thermolysis is increased almost by 100 degrees C. Gas evolution spikes and extremes in the calorimetric curve of the second step of decomposition in argon are reduced by 30-40 degrees C. An increase in the reactivity of fine particles and the amorphous state of iron (III) oxalate explained a reduction in gas evolution peaks. In order to describe the behaviour of the precursor, upon oxidative thermolysis likely reactions determining the process were suggested.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0869-8538			WOS:000513936300010		
J	Portinari, L; Chiosi, C; Bressan, A								Galactic chemical enrichment with new metallicity dependent stellar yields								ASTRONOMY & ASTROPHYSICS				334	2			505	539						JUN 10 1998	1998	New detailed stellar yields of several elemental species are derived for massive stars in a wide range of masses (from 6 to 120 M.) and metallicities (Z =0.0004, 0.004, 0.008, 0.02, 0.05). Our calculations are based on the Padova evolutionary tracks and take into account recent results on stellar evolution, such as overshooting and quiescent mass-loss, paying major attention to the effects of the initial chemical composition of the star. We finally include modern results on explosive nucleosynthesis in SN ae by Woosley & Weaver (1995). The issue of the chemical yields of Very Massive Objects (from 120 to 1000 M.) is also addressed.Our grid of stellar yields for massive stars is complementary to the results by Marigo et al. (1996, 1998) on the evolution and nucleosynthesis of low and intermediate mass stars, also based on the Padova evolutionary tracks. Altogether, they represent a complete set of stellar yields of unprecedented homogeneity and self-consistency.Our new stellar yields are inserted in a code for the chemical evolution of the Galactic disc with infall of primordial gas, according to the formulation first suggested by Talbot & Arnett (1971, 1973, 1975) and Chiosi (1980). As a first application, the code is used to develop a model of the chemical evolution of the Solar Vicinity, with a detailed comparison to the available observational constraints.									381	3	0	0	0	2	383			0004-6361			WOS:000074460500024

First, the potential-pH diagram of Pb-H2O system was constructed and the thermodynamic stable region was calibrated in the diagram. On the basis, the co-deposition of Pb, WC and ZrO2 particles from fluorboric acid solutions was realized on the surface of Pb-4wt%Sb substrate. The results show that deposition amounts of ZrO2 and WC particles in the inert electrodes increase with increasing ZrO2 concentrations in the bath, WC particle is easier to deposit into the inert electrodes than ZrO2 particle. The distribution of WC and ZrO2 particles as the second phase within metal matrix Pb is very uniform.

The chemical composition and surface morphology of the anodes were characterized by X-ray diffraction, Xray photoelectron spectroscopy and scanning electron microscopy. The electrochemical properties and corrosion resistance of the anode materials were established via linear sweep voltammetry, cyclic voltammetry, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and accelerated life tests. Results showed that the grain size of beta-PbO2 increased with AgNO3 concentration while Ag+ was oxidized to Ago and adsorbed on the electrode surface to accelerate the growth of beta-PbO2 grains. We also proposed the nucleation/deposition mechanism of beta-PbO2 electrode while verifying the role of Ag ion doping. The optimum electrocatalytic performance could be achieved when the concentration of AgNO3 was 6 g L-1. Compared with that of the undoped pure beta-PbO2 anode, the oxygen evolution potential of the Ti/Sn-Sb-RuOx/alpha PbO2/Ag-F-beta-PbO2 was decreased by 64 mV. The service life of the doped F-Ag-beta-PbO2 anode could reach up as high as 249 h, which was 1.66 times of pure beta-PbO2 anode. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Evolution of the Reaction Front Shape and Structure on Flame Acceleration and Deflagration-to-Detonation Transition								RUSSIAN JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY B				16	4			661	669		10.1134/S1990793122040248				AUG 2022	2022	Flame acceleration (FA) and the deflagration-to-detonation transition (DDT) are among the most interesting and exciting phenomena in the field of combustion and explosion of gases. From both practical and theoretical points of view, it is important to understand the basic laws governing these phenomena as well as the physical and/or chemical mechanisms and features of the process. High-speed flame-front photography during the deflagration of a premixed gas mixture in a long smooth tube with transparent walls was performed. A stoichiometric mixture of acetylene with oxygen diluted with argon by 25% is used. The experiments are carried out in a transparent cylindrical tube with an inner diameter of 60 mm and a length of 6 meters. The evolution of the structure and shape of the flame front from the moment of initiation of deflagration by a weak ignition source to the formation of a detonation wave is determined. Four characteristic phases of the propagation process are distinguished: at the first stage, the flame accelerates, then slows down, followed by flame propagation at an almost constant speed, and finally repeated acceleration, during which detonation is formed. It is shown how the dynamics of the process changes with a change in the initial pressure of the mixture. The most interesting and poorly studied stage of the DDT, the stage of intensive reacceleration, during which the flame abruptly changes shape, is described in detail.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1990-7931	1990-7923		WOS:000857354500013

Platinum has been used in an attempt to increase the charge transfer efficiency of the photoelectrode but also to investigate the balancing effect of surface co-catalysis on charge transfer versus recombination processes. The dynamics of the HER in pH-neutral aqueous solutions has been investigated by Photoelectrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy. Experimental impedance data has been analyzed using a model derived from considerations on heterogeneous kinetics. From the best experimental vs. calculation PEIS fits, microscopic rate parameters have been determined over an extended range of electrical potential. The charge transfer (k(t)) and recombination (k(r)) rate constants have been found to vary exponentially with the applied potential. The analysis of the potential dependence of k(t) led to a Butler-Volmer transfer coefficient of 0.21. The analysis of the potential dependence of the recombination rate constant k(r) led to the determination of a non-ideality factor beta = 0.04 (beta = 1 for ideal interfaces), demonstrating the strong non-ideal behavior of the interface. Such non-ideal behavior has been attributed to the presence of a high density of surface states. The space charge capacitance under inversion conditions, i.e. when a strong reversed bias is applied and when the surface of this p-semiconductor exhibits a n-type conductivity, has also been measured and analyzed.

Herein, the relationship between the luminescence characteristics and photocatalytic activities of these materials is examined as a function of Pt loading to define the spatial distribution of the Pt complex in the mesoporous channel. At low Pt loading, the Pt complex is located as an isolated species and exhibits strong photo-luminescence emission at room temperature owing to metal-to-ligand charge-transfer ((MLCT)-M-3) transitions (at about 530 nm). Energy- and/or electron-transfer from (MLCT)-M-3 to O-2 generate potentially active oxygen species, which are capable of promoting the selective photooxidation of styrene derivatives. On the other hand, short Pt center dot center dot center dot Pt interactions are prominent at high loading and the metal-metal-to-ligand charge-transfer ((MMLCT)-M-3) transition is at about 620 nm. Such Pt complexes, which are situated close to each other, efficiently catalyze H-2-evolution reactions in aqueous media in the presence of a sacrificial electron donor (EDTA) under visible-light irradiation. This study also investigates the effect of nanoconfinement on anchored guest complexes by considering the differences between the pore dimensions and structures of mesoporous-silica materials.									37	1	0	0	5	0	37			0947-6539			WOS:000308310100029	22865673

The demand of the world for green energy production and environmental remediation is workable to formulate active IR-harvest. Herein, we introduce a one-pot route for the synthesis and its first water-splitting application of novel cobalt titanate nanorods layered double hydroxide (CTN-LDH) via chloride-based precursors under acidic conditions to grow ultra-thin nanorods (20-50 nm) by longitudinal propagation of titanium hexachloride [TiCl6](2-) intermediate. Practically, CTN-LDH alone can achieve the highest oxygen evolution (OE) rate, about 5300 mu mol g(-1)h(-1) under full light or IR-irradiations without noble metal loading. The high IR-photocatalytic activity of CTN-LDH can be attributed to its narrow bandgap (1.4 eV) and specific nanostructure that improves the active site distribution, where IR light-harvesting and transferring by/through CTN-LDH units and sharply suppresses the recombination of the photoexcited electrons/holes pairs. The experimental results show that CTN-LDH owns high structure/photocatalytic stability as a promising water splitter under IR irradiation.									9	1	0	0	2	0	9			0378-7753	1873-2755		WOS:000536778100002		
J	Ye, Kai-Hang; Tang, Tongxin; Liang, Zhiting; Ji, Hongbing; Lin, Zhan; Yang, Shihe								Recent progress of bismuth vanadate-based photoelectrocatalytic water splitting								CHINESE SCIENCE BULLETIN-CHINESE				67	19			2115	2125		10.1360/TB-2021-0238				2022	2022	With increasing energy demands and ever-growing environmental concerns, solar energy and hydrogen energy have attracted worldwide attention. In particular, hydrogen energy not only has a high energy density, but also is clean, renewable, and carbon-free, when compared with primary energy sources such as coal, oil, and natural gas and secondary energy sources such as coal gas, petrol, and diesel. Photoelectrocatalytic (PEC) water splitting for hydrogen generation is a process in which a PEC cell containing photoelectrodes and electrolyte is used to split water into hydrogen and oxygen by solar energy. Therefore, PEC water splitting is one of the ideal ways to covert and store solar energy to hydrogen energy in terms of chemical bond energy. In a PEC cell, the photoanode is commonly based on n-type semiconductors and the photocathode based on p-type semiconductors. The efficiency of a PEC cell is determined by performance of these photoelectrodes interfaced with the electrolyte. However, because the oxygen evolution reaction on the photoanode is kinetically sluggish involving four electrons and the valance band maximum of photoanodes must be more positive than 1.23 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode, suitable n-type semiconductors are quite few for this purpose, limiting the common photoanodes to low efficiencies for PEC water splitting. In recent years, the bismuth vanadate photoanode has attracted great attention due to its relatively high theoretical maximum photocurrent density (approximate to 7 mA cm(-2)) and suitable band structure for water splitting, compared with other traditional photoanodes such as titanium dioxide, tungsten oxide, and zinc oxide. Extensive efforts have been made to unleash the full potential of the bismuth vanadate photoanode for PEC water splitting. In this mini review, we survey and analyze the design ideas and synthesis methods of high-performance bismuth vanadate photoanodes by looking back at the research progress made over the past few years on improving the light harvesting efficiency, photo-generated carrier separation efficiency and surface oxygen evolution efficiency of bismuth vanadate photoanodes. The strategies for improving the efficiencies of the bismuth vanadate photoanodes include defect state introduction, crystal facet and morphology control, and heterojunction engineering. Among the strategies, a single one, such as the defect state introduction, may enhance efficiencies of several processes (e.g., photo-generated carrier separation efficiency and surface oxygen evolution efficiency) of bismuth vanadate at the same time, but sometimes, it may enhance the efficiency of one process but degrade the efficiencies of others for the bismuth vanadate photoanode. Thus, how to comprehensively consider the cooperative mechanism to enhance the efficiencies of all the processes involved in PEC water splitting is the key to obtaining high performance bismuth vanadate photoanodes. At present, bismuth vanadate-based photoanodes have exhibited an extremely high photocurrent density and photo-generated carrier separation efficiency at higher bias voltage (over 5 mA cm(-2) at 1.23 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode with over 90% photo-generated carrier separation efficiency), but the light reflection of bismuth vanadate-based photoanodes makes it unable to reach the theoretical maximum photocurrent density (approximate to 7 mA cm(-2)). Moreover, the efficiencies of bismuth vanadate-based photoanodes at low bias voltages are still too low.Therefore, the future development direction should be to obtain higher photocurrent density at a lower voltage, and increase the absorption efficiency and wavelength range of bismuth vanadate to reach the theoretical photocurrent density and beyond. Although bismuth vanadate photoanodes are not necessarily the final large-scale application scheme of PEC water splitting in the future, their studies will help to provide guidelines for searching new high-performance photoanode materials.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0023-074X	2095-9419		WOS:000836798000002

However, its lack of environmental stability severely limits its processing in ambient conditions. Chemical functionalization is an effective method for increasing the ambient stability of the material. Herein, the main approaches for chemical functionalization of 2D BP with various organic and inorganic substrates, as well as the routes for the preparation of 0D/2D and 2D/2D heterostructures, are discussed. Furthermore, the recent advances of 2D BP-based materials in energy and catalysis fields are summarized.

The as-prepared nanocomposites were characterized by XRD, SEM, TEM, XPS, DRS, PL, EIS, TPC, CV, and MS techniques, and tested for their photocatalytic activities toward hydrogen evolution reactions (HERs). Zn(O, S) phase formation with low amounts of Ni and Co dopants and a Ga2O3 secondary phase were confirmed. The HER catalytic activity of the as-prepared nanocomposite could achieve similar to 9 mmol g(-1) h(-1) without any noble metal as a cocatalyst under low-power UV-light-illuminated conditions. Ethanol was used as the hole scavenger to enhance the photocarrier separation during the photocatalytic HER. It was found that Ni-Co codopants played an essential role in improving HER activities of Zn(O, S). Although the wide-bandgap Ga2O3 is not active for photoexcitation under 365 nm light irradiation, it is believed that oxygen vacancies in Ga2O3 induce the electron transfer from the conduction band of (Zn, Ni, Co)(O, S). This charge transfer contributes to the photocarrier separation, leading to a higher photocatalytic activity. Moreover, based on XPS results, the trivalent Ni dopant also generated positively charged antisite defects, which also helps electron trapping, reducing the electron-hole recombination rate. This work demonstrated a nanomaterial-design strategy involving simultaneously using dopants and nanocomposite concepts to enhance hydrogen production with an aim to solve the global energy issue.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1144-0546	1369-9261		WOS:000706772500001

Anion exchange membrane water electrolyzers (AEMWEs) are considered one of the most promising sustainable hydrogen production technologies because of their ability to split water using platinum group metal-free catalysts, less expensive anode flow fields, and bipolar plates. Critical to the realization of AEMWEs is understanding the durability-limiting factors that restrict the long-term use of these devices. This article presents both durability-limiting factors and mitigation strategies for AEMWEs under three operation modes, i.e., pure water-fed (no liquid electrolyte), concentrated KOH-fed, and 1 wt% K2CO3-fed operating at a differential pressure of 100 psi. We examine extended-term behaviors of AEMWEs at the single-cell level and connect their behavior with the electrochemical, chemical, and mechanical instability of single-cell components. Finally, we discuss the pros and cons of AEMWEs under these operation modes and provide direction for long-lasting AEMWEs with highly efficient hydrogen production capabilities.									50	0	1	0	2	0	50			1754-5692	1754-5706		WOS:000647155800001

INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR SCIENCES				19	8					2181	10.3390/ijms19082181				AUG 2018	2018	Brassica plants exhibit both high biomass productivity and high rates of heavy metal absorption. Metallothionein (MT) proteins are low molecular weight, cysteine-rich, metal-binding proteins that play crucial roles in protecting plants from heavy metal toxicity. However, to date, MT proteins have not been systematically characterized in Brassica. In this study, we identified 60 MTs from Arabidopsis thaliana and five Brassica species. All the MT family genes from Brassica are closely related to Arabidopsis MTs, encoding putative proteins that share similar functions within the same clades. Genome mapping analysis revealed high levels of synteny throughout the genome due to whole genome duplication and segmental duplication events. We analyzed the expression levels of 16 Brassica napus MTs (BnaMTs) by RNA-sequencing and real-time RT-PCR (RT-qPCR) analysis in plants under As3+ stress. These genes exhibited different expression patterns in various tissues. Our results suggest that BnaMT3C plays a key role in the response to As3+ stress in B. napus. This study provides insight into the phylogeny, origin, and evolution of MT family members in Brassica, laying the foundation for further studies of the roles of MT proteins in these important crops.									21	3	0	0	13	1	23				1422-0067		WOS:000442869800033	30049941

In order to improve the anode stability, ternary carbide, Ti3SiC2, could be a promising material for the coating support, since chemical corrosion stability of Ti3SiC2 is Significantly higher if compared to Ti. In this work, the possibility of the sol-gel preparation of RuO,TiO2 coating on Ti3SiC2 is investigated and comparison of the basic characteristics of sol-get processed oxide coating, Ru0.5Ti0.5O2, applied onto Ti3SiC2 and Ti, is reported. Microscopic investigation of the coating surface showed that considerably less cracked coating is formed onto the Ti3SiC2 support. Slightly higher voltammetric currents are registered for Ti3SiC2-supported coating in H2SO4 and NaCl solution. The activity for chlorine evolution is higher, while the currents of oxygen evolution reaction are lower for Ru0.5Ti0.5O2/Ti3SiC2 anode in comparison to Ru0.5Ti0.5O2/Ti anode. Even though these preliminary results on the basic electrochemical properties of Ru0.5Ti0.5O2/Ti3SiC2 anode and chemical stability of Ti3SiC2 are promising, the accelerated stability test in NaCl solution showed that coated Ti3SiC2 is not anodically stable and lasts considerably shorter than Ru0.5Ti0.5O2/Ti anode prepared and tested under the same conditions.

The thermal behavior of wood powder was analyzed using thermogravimetric/Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. The suspended single pellet combustion phenomenon under a convective hot air stream was also explored. The results showed that the wood primarily decomposed in a range from 240 degrees C to 520 degrees C, and low-temperature ignition was found at 293 degrees C due to heterogeneous oxidation. For pellet combustion, an outstanding heterogeneous-induced homogeneous combustion phenomenon occurred when the stream temperature was higher than 350 degrees C. In contrast, the ignition mechanism shifted to volatile auto-ignite mode at 650 degrees C due to the interplay of fuel devolatilization and oxygen diffusion. The pellet temperature evolution was measured, and the results revealed a maximum heating rate of 6.61-16.95 K/s under a stream temperature ranging from 350 degrees C to 650 degrees C. The weight loss evolution showed three stages during the entire heating process, and the average activation energy (13.12 kJ/mol) was obtained. Char combustion was found favorable to CO production for gaseous emissions, but the burning of volatiles tended to convert fuel into CO2. Finally, a simplified reaction scheme based on different onset temperatures, including pyrolysis, heterogeneous/homogeneous oxidation, and heterogeneous gasification was proposed to illustrate a potential thermochemical conversion route for further utilization.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0363-907X	1099-114X		WOS:000598595800001

Surface characterization tools enable to assess atomic scale information on the complexity of electrocatalyst materials. Advancing electrochemical methodologies to adequately characterize such systems was less of a research focus point. In this Review, we shed light on the ability to gain fundamental insights into electrocatalysis from a complementary perspective and establish corresponding design strategies. These may rely on adopting the perceptions and models of other subareas of electrochemistry, such as corrosion, battery research, or electrodeposition. Concepts on how to account for and improve mass transport, manage gas bubble release, or exploit magnetic fields are highlighted in this respect. Particular attention is paid to deriving design strategies for nanoelectrocatalysts, which is often impeded, as structural and physical material properties are buried in electrochemical data of whole electrodes or even devices. Thus, a second major approach focuses on overcoming this difference in the considered level of complexity by methods of single-entity electrochemistry. The gained understanding of intrinsic catalyst performance may allow to rationally advance design concepts with increased complexity, such as three-dimensional electrode architectures. Many materials undergo structural changes upon formation of the working catalyst. Accordingly, developing "precatalysts" with low hindrance of the electrochemical transformation to the active catalyst is suggested as a final design strategy.									29	1	0	0	1	0	28			2155-5435			WOS:000649106200036

Taking advantages of the superior conductivity of N-doped graphite carbon, the good electrocatalytic performance of Co-based alloys for HER and excellent performance of cobalt-based oxide for OER, herein, we prepare a CoFex-CoFe2O4/N-doped carbon nanocomposite with a hierarchical porous structure used to HER and OER by pyrolysis of a new single source precursor {[Co(H2O)(6)][Fe(Hedta)Cl](2)center dot 4H(2)O]}. CoFex-CoFe2O4/N-doped carbon displays high activity with small overpotentials of respective 159 and 257mV required to achieve a current density of 20 mA cm(-2) as well as catalytic durability for HER and OER in 1.0 M KOH. Furthermore, this bifunctional electrocatalyst enables an alkaline electrolyzer with 20 mA cm(-2) at a cell voltage of similar to 1.68 V. The good performance of CF-CFO/NC for HER and OER can be attributed to the low charge transfer impedance, a porous structure and the synergistic role of cobalt-based alloy and cobalt-based mixed metal oxide. This work may provide a new approach to prepare an efficient, cost-effective and superior electrocatalyst in large scale using earth-abundant elements. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Sang, Wenjing; Zhang, Gong; Lan, Huachun; An, Xiaoqiang; Liu, Huijuan				Zhang, Gong/T-2457-2019				The effect of different exposed facets on the photoelectrocatalytic degradation of o-chlorophenol using p-type Cu2O crystals								ELECTROCHIMICA ACTA				231				429	436		10.1016/j.electacta.2017.02.073				MAR 20 2017	2017	Although it is known that the efficacy of photoelectrocatalysts is enhanced by increasing the amount of high energy surface exposed, the development of a universal synthesis method with both superior activity and simplicity is needed for scalable applications. We herein controllably fabricated cuprous oxide (Cu2O) micro crystals with different morphologies, evolving from cubes, cuboctahedra, truncated octahedra and finally to octahedra on indium tin oxide (ITO) glass substrates, by a facile electrochemical deposition method. The structures of facet-engineered Cu2O samples and the underlying mechanism for the morphology evolution were investigated. The separation of photogenerated hole-electron pairs on Cu2O crystals with different exposed facets was characterized by measuring the photocurrent densities with chopped illumination, which increased with the increased concentrations of PVP: the octahedral Cu2O crystals, with the highest proportion of {111} facets exposed, exhibited the lowest electro-hole recombination in contrast to the cubes, cuboctahedra, and truncated octahedra, respectively. The photoelectrocatalytic degradation efficiency of the o-chlorophenol (2-CP) pollutant under sunlight irradiation with Cu2O-coated photocathode was further investigated to reveal the effect of different exposed facets. Due to the increased number of surface active sites available for degradation reactions, the octahedral Cu2O microcrystals presented higher photoelectrocatalytic activity compared to other shapes. Active oxygen species detected by electron spin-resonance (ESR) spectrometry implied that abundant superoxide radicals (O-2(center dot-)) were the dominant active radicals in the degradation.

However, to date, how to speed up the transfer rate of photogenerated charges, especially hole transfer rate, still remains a formidable challenge. Herein, a novel system of g-C3N4/1,1-ferrocenedicarboxylic acid (FcDA) composites was developed for efficient visible light-driven H-2 evolution, in which the redox mediator FcDA served as hole-transport molecules and platinum (Pt) acted as an electron sink. The FcDA molecules are anchored onto g-C3N4 by hydrogen-bonding interactions between the carboxylic groups and amino groups as well as - interactions between aromatic FcDA and graphitic C3N4. The matched energy-levels between g-C3N4 and FcDA facilitate photogenerated hole transfer from the g-C3N4 valence band to FcDA that results in the formation of FcDA(+) radicals, and thus, photoinduced electrons and holes are efficiently separated. Due to the additional charge separation pathway, enhanced hole transfer kinetics, and the extremely rapid intermolecular radical reactions, charge recombination is effectively suppressed; therefore, more electrons can be released for hydrogen production. Under optimal experimental conditions, the developed g-C3N4/FcDA composite with 4 wt% FcDA exhibits high water splitting activity with a H-2 evolution rate of up to 77.91 mol h(-1), which is nearly 6 times that of bare g-C3N4 (13.18 mol h(-1)). Moreover, the obtained g-C3N4/FcDA photocatalyst displays excellent stability, and there is no obvious decrease in the H-2-production rate after five test cycles. Thus, we anticipate that our simple modification strategy will offer an avenue to merge the polymeric g-C3N4 photocatalyst with surface organometallic chemistry for high-efficiency solar-to-fuel conversion.									22	2	0	0	1	0	23			2044-4753	2044-4761		WOS:000434386000012

This is generally also reflected in the phase composition of the metallic and substoichiometric oxide coatings. The Al-rich compositions, Al0.75Cr0.25 and Al0.70Cr0.30, show a strong tendency for the formation of gamma(1)-Al8Cr5 phases. Mostly, the coating compositions of the metallic constituents of the synthesised intermetallic and substoichiometric oxide coatings deviate from the elemental compositions of the cathode, show enrichment in Cr. This deviation is more pronounced for Cr-rich cathodes using low O-2 flow rates during deposition.The dense columnar structure of the intermetallic coatings (hardness values between 2.5 and 10.2 GPa) turns into a nano-composite-like morphology for depositions with 50 and 100 sccm O-2 p.a.s., which in turn leads to a significant hardness increase up to similar to 24 GPa. Among all coatings investigated, the Cr-rich compositions have higher hardness and denser morphology than the Al-rich layers.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			0257-8972			WOS:000447106400041

Most of the known vascular adaptation mechanisms are based on local reactions to local stimuli such as pressure and flow, which in turn reflects influence from the surrounding tissue. Here we present a simple two-dimensional model in which, as an alternative approach, the tissue is modeled as a porous medium with intervening sharply defined flow channels. Based on simple, physiologically realistic assumptions, flow-channel structure adapts so as to reach a configuration in which all parts of the tissue are supplied. A set of model parameters uniquely determine the model dynamics, and we have identified the region of the best-performing model parameters (a global optimum). This region is surrounded in parameter space by less optimal model parameter values, and this separation is characterized by steep gradients in the related fitness landscape. Hence it appears that the optimal set of parameters tends to localize close to critical transition zones. Consequently, while the optimal solution is stable for modest parameter perturbations, larger perturbations may cause a profound and permanent shift in systems characteristics. We suggest that the system is driven toward a critical state as a consequence of the ongoing parameter optimization, mimicking an evolutionary pressure on the system.									1	0	0	0	1	0	1			1664-042X			WOS:000209173000383	23060814

Interestingly, GO can adhere to the surface of Co3O4 NWs via an ultrathin gossamer-like sheet, and the coverage and wrapping of GO on the surface of Co3O4 NWs can be controlled by tuning the electrochemical deposition time and voltage. Our results also demonstrate that GO wrapped Co3O4 NWs had superior photoelectrochemical activity for the decolorization of dye (reactive brilliant blue KN-R) in wastewater, mainly because the introduction of GO can tune the oxygen evolution behavior, the transportation of reactant and induced carriers, electrochemical active areas, and the light-harvesting capability of Co3O4 NWs. Therefore, we anticipate that GO wrapped Ti/Co3O4 NWs could be considered as a promising photoanode for the treatment of organic pollutants in wastewater.									4	0	0	0	1	0	4			0957-4484	1361-6528		WOS:000521475200001	32045900	
J	McIntosh, JC; Walter, LM; Martini, AM								Extensive microbial modification of formation water geochemistry: Case study from a Midcontinent sedimentary basin, United States								GEOLOGICAL SOCIETY OF AMERICA BULLETIN				116	5-6			743	759		10.1130/B25371.1				MAY-JUN 2004	2004	The Upper Devonian Antrim Shale in the Michigan Basin is an economically significant source of microbially produced methane along the basin margins where meteoric recharge has been focused. Oxygen and hydrogen stable isotope compositions of Antrim formation waters show that fresh waters, recharged from Pleistocene glaciation and modern precipitation, suppressed basinal brine salinity to great depths and enhanced methanogenesis. This paper presents results of integrated elemental and isotope analyses of Antrim Shale formation waters from the margins and center of the Michigan Basin, focusing on solute sources and geochemical modifications associated with regionally extensive microbial methanogenesis. Cl-Br-Na systematics reveal that salinity is controlled not only by mixing between variable amounts of basinal brine and meteoric water, but also by halite dissolution where fluids recharged through underlying Devonian carbonate aquifers with localized evaporite deposits.Divalent cations, carbonate system parameters, and carbon isotope compositions of dissolved inorganic carbon have been systematically and profoundly altered by microbial methanogenesis. Large decreases in formation water Ca/Mg and Ca/Sr ratios accompany increasing carbonate alkalinity values in areas with high rates of microbial gas production. Thermodynamic and reaction-path modeling show that these changes are consistent with calcite precipitation during progressive microbial methanogenesis. Similar variations in fluid chemistry are evident in databases from other sedimentary basins containing black shales and coal beds associated with microbial gas. Microbial methanogenesis may play an important role in the geochemical evolution of divalent cation relationships in crustal fluids and should be considered in models of formation water origin and evolution.									61	2	0	0	7	0	63			0016-7606	1943-2674		WOS:000221045900016

However, although voltage decay issues cause continuous energy loss and impede commercialization, the prerequisite driving force for this phenomenon remains a mystery(3-6) Here, with in situ nanoscale sensitive coherent X-ray diffraction imaging techniques, we reveal that nanostrain and lattice displacement accumulate continuously during operation of the cell. Evidence shows that this effect is the driving force for both structure degradation and oxygen loss, which trigger the well-known rapid voltage decay in LMR cathodes. By carrying out micro- to macro-length characterizations that span atomic structure, the primary particle, multiparticle and electrode levels, we demonstrate that the heterogeneous nature of LMR cathodes inevitably causes pernicious phase displacement/strain, which cannot be eliminated by conventional doping or coating methods. We therefore propose mesostructural design as a strategy to mitigate lattice displacement and inhomogeneous electrochemical/structural evolutions, thereby achieving stable voltage and capacity profiles. These findings highlight the significance of lattice strain/displacement in causing voltage decay and will inspire a wave of efforts to unlock the potential of the broad-scale commercialization of LMR cathode materials.									11	1	0	0	0	0	11			0028-0836	1476-4687		WOS:000809214700012	35676429

In this paper, nickel-iron phosphide nanosheets on nickel foam (Ni-Fe-P/NF) were synthesized through in-situ chemical etching and subsequently phosphating treatment. The Ni foam utilized in this work not only serves as conductive substrate and metal current collector, but also as nickel source for the growth of metal organic frameworks (i.e. Prussian blue analogue pyramids), which were then converted to Ni-Fe-P nanosheets via phosphating. Benefiting from the unique nanostructure, Fe incorporation, and the high conductivity of nickel foam, the resulting Ni-Fe-P/NF could be used as self-supported and binder-free working electrode with superior overall electrochemical water splitting performance. Electrochemical measurement demonstrates that the Ni-Fe-P/NF exhibits excellent electrocatalytic activities with overpotentials of 98 mV for HER and 168 mV for OER to deliver current densities of 10 mA cm(-2) in 1 M KOH solution. Furthermore, the Ni-Fe-P/NF catalyst was also employed as both as anode and cathode for overall water electrolysis, and shows extraordinary activities with low voltage of only 1.486 V to yield 10 mA cm(-2) and outstanding cycling stability with negligible voltage elevation after chronopotentiometry determination for 200 h. This work highlights that direct growth of metal organic frameworks on conductive substrates is an effective method to explore electrocatalysts for multifunctional electrochemical applications.

Tuning the electrolyte composition (e.g. Fe2+ additives) has been demonstrated to be an efficient approach for in situ cocatalyst regeneration and photocorrosion inhibition. Photoelectrode stabilization by surface passivation is adopted as the most vital approach for obtaining high stability. Herein, we challenge the traditional strategy to in situ passivate the surface states with a "surface-protected etching" process for tuning the electrolyte composition via employing F- anions in borate buffer. The F- species could incorporate into the Co-catalyst to activate catalytic sites for cocatalyst reconstruction, improving the charge transport of BiVO4. More importantly, the dynamic migration of F- anions with strong chemical bonds suppresses the volume change of the cocatalyst, passivates the surface states of BiVO4/cocatalyst, and minimizes the dissolution of BiVO4 over long-term measurement, which further inhibits the photocorrosion of electrodes. The resulting photoanode allows stable oxygen evolution over 100 h at a low potential of 0.6 V-RHE, which is superior to the traditional NiOOH/FeOOH double layer cocatalyst. This finding on in situ etching and passivation engineering shines a light on boosting the stability of photoelectrodes in such electrolyte systems.									13	0	0	0	0	0	13			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000631985900030

In the heterostructure, separate phases of Co(9)S(8)and MoS(2)are formed, but they are connected by Co-S-Mo type covalent bonds. The charge redistribution from Co to Mo occurring at the interface enhances the electron-doped characteristics of MoS(2)to generate electron-rich Mo atoms. Besides, reductive annealing during the synthesis forms S defects that activates adjacent Mo atoms for further enhanced HER activity as elucidated by the density functional theory (DFT) calculation. Eventually, the covalent Co9S8-MoS(2)heterostructure shows amplified HER activity as well as stability in all pH electrolytes. The synergistic effect is pronounced when the heterostructure is coupled with a porous Ni foam (NF) support to form Co9S8-MoS2/NF that displays superior performance to those of the state-of-the-art non-noble metal electrocatalysts, and even outperforms a commercial Pt/C catalyst in a practically meaningful, high current density region in alkaline (>170 mA cm(-2)) and neutral (>60 mA cm(-2)) media. The high HER performance and stability of Co9S8-MoS(2)heterostructure make it a promising pH universal alternative to expensive Pt-based electrocatalysts for practical water electrolyzers.									64	3	0	0	7	0	66			1616-301X	1616-3028		WOS:000559498100001

Herein, a novel NiWO4/CdS nanosheets-on-nanorods direct Z-Scheme heterostructure was developed by using a facile in-situ approach. The optimized NiWO4/CdS heterostructure shows a H2 evolution rate of 26.43 mmol g-1 h-1 exceeding that of bare CdS by more than 75 folds. Systematic investigations reveal the nanostructures with numerous active sites, intimate contact interface, and enhanced charge separation rate synergistically account for the outstanding performance of the NiWO4/CdS. Moreover, the band structures were detailedly analyzed and the tentative photocatalytic mechanism was proposed, which could contribute to deeply understanding the catalytic process and guide the synthesis of the efficient heterostructure. These findings and strategies may have great significance in promoting the development of highly efficient and low-cost photocatalysts.

Herein, we present an oxygen-deficient PbO decorated rice-husk-based hierarchical porous carbon (RHHPC@PbO1-x) composite as an effective additive of negative electrode in lead-carbon battery. The RHHPC@PbO1-x composite was prepared from a facile sol-gel/annealing method. The obtained RHHPC@PbO1-x composite and the lead-carbon electrode with RHHPC@PbO1-x additives were characterized by various physicochemical methods, such as scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, and multiple electrochemical methods. The RHHPC@PbO1-x composite enhances the electrochemical active surface area and strengthens the structural stability of lead-carbon electrode, which improves the electrode kinetics and the cycling stability of lead-carbon negative electrode. As a result, the cycling life of a 2 V/4 Ah valve-regulated lead-carbon battery with RHHPC@PbO1-x composite additives exhibited a lifespan of 900 cycles (triple of the blank battery). Our work gives an insight for interphase and porosity tuning of lead-carbon additives used in lead-carbon battery. Based on the existing mature production facilities of lead-acid battery, it is promising for this RHHPC@PbO1-x additive to be used in commercial lead-carbon batteryies for renewable energy storage.

The electrical conductivity of meso-CoP is 37times higher than that of nonporous CoP, and it displays semimetallic behavior with a negligibly small activation energy of 26meV at temperatures below 296K. Above this temperature, only materials with mesopores underwent a change in conductivity from semimetallic to semiconducting behavior. These properties were attributed to the coexistence of nanocrystalline Co2P phases. The poor crystallinity of mesoporous materials has often been considered to be a problem but this example clearly shows its positive aspects. The concept introduced here should thus lead to new routes for the synthesis of materials with high electronic conductivity.									31	0	0	0	1	0	31			1433-7851	1521-3773		WOS:000412755200063	28941047

Under a general point of view, this class of materials might have played an important role for the origin of life on planet Earth, given their ability to adsorb and concentrate life-relevant molecules in sea environments. It has been speculated that the organic-mineral interactions could have permitted to organize the adsorbed molecules, leading to an increase in their local concentration and finally to the emergence of life. Inspired by nature, material scientists, engineers and chemists have started to leverage the ability of LDHs to absorb and concentrate molecules and biomolecules within life-like compartments, allowing to realize highly-efficient bioinspired platforms, usable for bioanalysis, therapeutics, sensors and bioremediation. This review aims at summarizing the latest evolution of LDHs in this research field under an unprecedented perspective, finally providing possible challenges and directions for future research.									11	0	0	0	3	0	11			2073-4352			WOS:000556249300001

Here, we show that extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase 5 (Erk5) is lost in the hearts of obese/diabetic animal models and that cardiac-specific deletion of Erk5 in mice (Erk5-CKO) leads to dampened cardiac contractility and mitochondrial abnormalities with repressed fuel oxidation and oxidative damage upon high fat diet (HFD). Erk5 regulation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma co-activator-1 alpha (Pgc-1v) is critical for cardiac mitochondrial functions. More specifically, we show that Gp91phox activation of calpain-1 degrades Erk5 in free fatty acid (FFA)-stressed cardiomyocytes, whereas the prevention of Erk5 loss by blocking Gp91phox or calpain-1 rescues mitochondrial functions. Similarly, adeno-associated virus 9 (AAV9)-mediated restoration of Erk5 expression in Erk5-CKO hearts prevents cardiomyopathy. These findings suggest that maintaining Erk5 integrity has therapeutic potential for treating metabolic stress-induced cardiomyopathy.									44	4	0	0	27	0	46			2041-1723			WOS:000410003800008	28887535

Titanium dioxide is an established photocatalyst, however it suffers from poor visible light absorption, thus limiting its use under solar irradiation. Thermal annealing can enhance the visible light absorption, with the downside of introducing more defect traps that reduce the lifetime of the charge separated state. Hence, this study proposes an alternative to chemical methods, by modulating the surface profile of the nanotube array to trap visible light. The enhanced visible light absorption is predicted via computational modelling and the morphological evolution of the anodization process was investigated. This study provides the basis for further work into LIPSS templating of other anodized transition metal oxide materials.

Some representative works are highlighted to give a scientific concept and understanding of the versatile applications of TMPS in water splitting, fuel cells, batteries, and supercapacitors. An outstanding catalytic activity/promotion effect was achieved in catalyst systems due to the synergistic effects between the various components. Problems and challenges are also discussed to inspire the development of novel nanoscaled TMPs as efficient and robust catalysts for commercial applications in real energy technologies.									134	13	0	0	4	0	136			2196-0216			WOS:000394144300003

Stage one is oxygen depletion inside the crevice, stage two is the development of a critical crevice solution (induction stage), and stage three is long-term aggressive dissolution that is consistent with a nearly well-mixed, IR controlled crevice system. In stage one, deoxygenation allows separation of the anodic and cathodic sites. In stage two, local initiation occurs at the crevice tip that diffuses toward the crevice mouth. Minimal dissolution occurs in stage two and complete initiation occurs when the total anodic current is such that the critical IR drop is observed. In stage three, the crevice is saturated at or near the critical crevice solution and metal salt precipitates allow stable crevice corrosion propagation. The key inputs to the three-stage model are concentration-dependent polarization curves, and hydrolysis and hydroxide precipitation reaction data. Model calculations are compared with experimental damage histories and total current measurements. Analytical solutions and 2D modeling efforts are also used to validate the proposed 1D approach for simplified systems leading up to the complex Ni-625 system. All results agree under a thin-film approximation. Further, it is shown that with appropriate experimental input data, and knowledge from solution of the species-dependent system, a damage evolution well-mixed model provides comparable results.

The most redshifted quasars, galaxies, and Lyalpha absorbers currently observed, however, all exhibit at least some admixture of heavier elements, as do the most ancient stars in the Galaxy.

Studying the formation of bio-char is not only helpful to intensify the transformation of biomass, but also to improve its performance. However, little work has been reported on the similarities and differences of bio-chars in fast and slow pyrolysis. We investigated the fast and slow pyrolysis of walnut shell at 400-800 degrees C to find the evolvement law of bio-char. It was found that the formation mechanism of bio-char in fast pyrolysis is almost the same as that in slow pyrolysis. There are two stages in the formation of bio-char: the generation of free radicals caused by the covalent bond breaking at temperature less than 600 degrees C; the reduce of free radicals through the condensation reactions from 600 to 800 degrees C. The contents of various oxygen-containing functional groups presented regularity with the increase of pyrolysis temperature, in which the quinone group increases with the pyrolysis temperature increasing, which phenomenon could be used as a signal to exhibit the stabilization of oxygen in bio-char. The bio-char yields, free radicals and quinone contents are slightly higher in slow pyrolysis. The graphite crystals in bio-char have the tendency of microcrystallization with the increase of temperature, in which progress the fast pyrolysis has superiority at the low temperature.									33	1	0	0	8	0	34			0016-2361	1873-7153		WOS:000500155800010

The carbon material must combine three functions, i.e., electrical conductivity for electron transport, optimal pores for ion motion, and abundant heteroatom sites for catalysis. Here, an ideal carbon catalyst is achieved by combining two strategiesthe use of a 2D covalent organic framework (COF) and the development of a suitable template to guide the pyrolysis. The COF produces nanosized carbon sheets that combine high conductivity, hierarchical porosity, and abundant heteroatom catalytic edges. The catalysts achieve superior performance to authentic Pt/C with exceptional onset potential (0 V vs -0.03 V), half-wave potentials (-0.11 V vs -0.16 V), high limit current density (7.2 mA cm(-2) vs 6.0 mA cm(-2)), low Tafel slope (110 mV decade(-1) vs 121 mV decade(-1)), long-time stability, and methanol tolerance. These results reveal a novel material platform based on 2D COFs for designing novel 2D carbon materials.									112	5	0	0	9	0	113			0935-9648	1521-4095		WOS:000430101200017	29504158

The use of the reaction raw material to accomplish crystal facet control and ratio optimization is an important and challenging subject in the field of facet engineering, as the activity of the photocatalyst can be improved without introducing impurities. Here, we report the evolution of PbMoO4 from a lamellar to a 26-faceted polyhedron via a wet chemical method. The redox crystal facet ratio does not change the light absorption capacity, but the photocarrier separation efficiency is improved depending on the ratio of oxidized (111)/reduced (001) surfaces. Based on the exposed facet band structure, electrostatic potential, and EDX of photodeposited species, adjacent (101) only contributes to the transport and separation of photogenerated electrons (e(-)) from (111) to (001), while photogenerated holes (h(+)) respectively migrate from (101) and (001) to (111) under the different valence band position and electrostatic potential. The collaboration of three crystal planes with a certain ratio maximizes the separation of carriers and produces dramatic changes, such as from the inability of H2O oxidation to the ability of O-2 evolution (18.78 mu mol/(g.h)). In addition, there are more effective h(+) that can simultaneously participate in the oxidation of other substances during the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). So, a larger ratio of (111)/(001) combined with a harmonized (101) crystal surface makes a PbMoO4 polyhedron that has more excellent photocarrier separation ability and versatile oxidation capacity.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			2574-0962			WOS:000756324400093

Narrow absorption components with velocities at similar to -2620 and -2820 km s(-1), superposed on broader and shallow absorption, are observed in the outburst spectra for the Be-7 ii lambda lambda 313.0583, 313.1228 nm doublet resonance lines, as well as in several other elements such as Ca ii, Fe i, Mg i, Na i, H i and Li i. Using the Ca ii K line as a reference element, we infer N(Be-7)/N(H) approximate to 7.4 x 10(-6), or approximate to 9.8 x 10(-6) when the Be-7 decay is taken into account. The Be-7 abundance is about half of the value most frequently measured in novae. The possible presence of overionization in the layers where Be-7 ii is detected is also discussed. Observations taken at the Telescopio Nazionale Galileo in La Palma 91 days after discovery showed prominent emission lines of oxygen and neon, which allow us to classify the nova as ONe type. Therefore, although Be-7 is expected to be higher in CO novae, it is found at comparable levels in both nova types.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			0035-8711	1365-2966		WOS:000756700200006

Taking the Si-based photoanode as a model system, we propose a facile strategy to enable sputtering deposition of the film without damaging the underlying layer by introducing a metal sputtering buffer layer, which ensures high-quality interface structure and excellent water oxidation performance. In our work, the Ni sputtering buffer layer avoids the damage on the Al2O3 passivation layer during the NiFe oxide electrocatalyst sputtering process. Consequently, a Si/Al2O3/Ni metal-insulator-semiconductor junction with a precise configuration is formed, which increases the Si barrier height by reducing the interface state density and suppressing Fermi-level pinning, thus enhancing the photovoltage in thermodynamics and accelerating the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in kinetics. In addition, the dense NiFe oxide with high transmittance and antireflection properties functions as both an efficient OER electrocatalyst and a robust protective layer and contributes to efficient use of the incident light. The photoanode affords a high water oxidation activity with an onset potential of similar to 0.92 V vs reversible hydrogen electrode (V-RH(E)) and a high photocurrent density of similar to 31 mA cm(-2) at 1.23 V-RHE after further incorporating the cocatalyst NiFe-layered double hydroxide and has no obvious decay after 330 h of continuous operation. This strategy is beneficial for developing energy conversion devices on a large scale.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			2574-0962			WOS:000576676900014

The influence of MoS2 is systematically investigated on the structure, optical properties and photocatalytic activity of the ZnAgIn5S8/MoS2 nanocomposites, where the compromise of the catalytic activity and light shielding effect and increased stability is observed with increasing MoS2. The optimized Zn-AgIn5S8/MoS2-5% composite exhibits high photocatalytic activity for nearly complete degradation of Rhodamine B within 4 min under visible light irradiation. The composite photocatalysts also show good activity on degradation of other organic pollutants including a colorless antibiotic, tetracycline. Photocatalytic mechanism study proves that the main oxidizing species is the superoxide radical formed by the reaction of photogenerated electrons and oxygen molecules, for which MoS2 mainly acts as a cocatalyst that promotes the electron transfer from the Zn-AgIn5S8 QDs. Time-resolved photoluminescence spectroscopy further reveals the increased charge separation by MoS2 from the photoluminescence quenching and lifetime decrease of the QDs, especially that of the long-lived trap states. Moreover, more efficient charge transfer from the dyes is also observed with Zn-AgIn5S8/MoS2, which is distinctively different from that with the Zn-AgIn5S8 QDs, indicating stronger interaction between the dye and photocatalyst with the introduction of MoS2. Based on these results, a continuous charge flow mechanism is proposed, where the electron transfer can be promoted by MoS2 not only from the QDs but also from the dyes that are all converted to superoxide radicals and contributed to the photocatalytic activity increase.									33	1	0	0	10	0	33			2046-2069			WOS:000387427800057

Microwave and electrodeposition methods were employed for the deposition of Sb-SnO2 and PbO2 on the TiO2 nanotube array template, respectively. The structure and surface morphology of the composite electrode were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM). Electrochemical measurements including cyclic voltammetry (CV), electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and accelerated life measurements were employed to investigate the electrochemical activity and stability of the hybrid electrode. The obtained composite electrode had an ordered multilayer structure with the TiO2 nanotube array serving as a tubal template and the Sb-SnO2 coating as an interlayer, and exhibited an enhanced electrocatalytic activity, long lifetime (815 h) and high oxygen evolution reaction potential. Acid Red G (ARG) was employed as a model organic pollutant for electrochemical degradation to evaluate the electrocatalytic activity of the composite electrode. Several operation variables, such as initial concentration, current densities, initial pH values, temperature of electrolyte, and chloride ions were investigated to explore the removal efficiency of ARG. It was found that low concentration, high current densities and addition of chloride ions could significantly improve the colour removal efficiency. Nevertheless, variables of pH and temperature had little impact on the colour removal efficiency. These results show that the hybrid electrode may become a promising electrode in treating wastewater.									45	11	0	0	5	0	54				2046-2069		WOS:000350043600039

Various diatomic (Co-5c(O)-O-2(-)-Co-5c(O) superoxo, Co-5c(o)-O-2(2-)-Co-2c(T), peroxo, (O-O-surf)(2-) peroxo) and monatomic (O-Co-2c(T) and O-Co-5c(O) metal-oxo) reactive oxygen species were described in detail regarding their electronic and magnetic structure. The band alignment diagrams between the pDOS of dioxygen and the exposed cobalt cations were constructed and used to rationalize the revealed pronounced speciation of the surface oxygen, depending on the adsorption geometry (monodentate eta(1), bidentate eta(2), bridging mu), varying extent of oxygen reduction (one, two, four electrons), and the entailed complex spin relaxation. It was shown that surface cobalt cations work in tandem constituting dual Co-5c(O)-Co-5c(O) and Co-5c(O)-Co-2c(T) sites for O-2 activation. The metal-oxo species were formulated in terms of the O- moieties ferromagnetically coupled to Co ions, and orbital overlap type (sigma for O-Co-2c(T) or pi for O-Co-5c(O)) is mainly responsible for the observed differences in their stabilities and mobilities. A three-dimensional plot of the O/Co ratio as a function of T and po(2) provided a suitable contextual thermodynamic background for understanding the dioxygen/surface interactions, and was used to support the kinetic data of the isotopic O-16(2)/O-18(2) exchange reaction. The elaborated molecular mechanism of the dioxygen interaction with the cobalt spinel (100) surface was applied for ab initio microkinetic modeling of the isotopic O-16(2)/O-18(2) exchange reaction in the reactant lean and rich conditions, providing a theoretical account for TAP and TPSR experiments. Three stages of the evolution were distinguished: latent (surface accumulation of the dissociated O-18* and O-16* adspecies), transient (gradual development of the (OO)-O-16-O-18 isotopomer in the gas phase), and equilibrium (equilibration of the isotopic composition). It was also shown that Co-2c(T) (2+)-O- acts as rigid (E-diff = 1.35 eV) spectator species and only the labile Co-5c(O) (3+)-O- (E-diff = 0.68 eV) are directly involved in the isotopic exchange. The simulated TPSR curves were confronted with the O-16(2)/O-18(2) exchange experiments performed on a cobalt spinel nanocube catalyst, synthesized by the hydrothermal method and characterized by XRD, RS, and HR-TEM techniques. An excellent quantitative agreement between experiment and theory substantiates the developed molecular mechanism, selection of the kinetically relevant steps, and calculation of their energetic and entropic barriers.									18	0	0	0	0	0	18			1932-7447			WOS:000414724300030

In general, the activity of the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) electrocatalyst determines the performance of the Zn-H+ battery to a great extent. In our attempt, an inexpensive and effective HER electrocatalyst was synthesized successfully. In this electrocatalyst, the Cu based coordination complex loads onto filter paper derived three-dimensional mesoporous carbon paper homogeneously. Compared with traditional powder electrocatalysts, the bulky appearance of this electrocatalyst makes it possible that it can be employed as a binder-free electrode directly. In the acidic electrolyte, it exhibits perfect electrocatalytic activity. The eta(10) potential of this electrocatalyst is only 91 mV. This electrocatalyst also shows excellent durability after long time HER tests. With this electrocatalyst and Zn plate as cathode and anode, respectively, a Zn-H+ battery was assembled. The open circuit voltage of this battery is 1.18 V. Its peak power density arrives at 65.6 mW.cm(-2). When discharged at 10 mA.cm(-2), the voltage of this battery keeps stable for 10 h. In this process, the specific capacity and energy density of Zn-H+ battery are 768 mAh.g(-1) and 875 Wh.kg(-1), respectively. At this current density, its H-2 production rate arrives at 578 mu mol in 80 min, with a Faradaic efficiency 96.3%.

This reaction is reversible, as dimers can be thermally decomposed at sufficiently elevated temperatures and both photodimerization and decomposition are temperature dependent. In operando conditions of OSCs evidently involve exposure to both light and heat, following periodic diurnal and seasonal profiles. In this work, the kinetics of dimer formation and decomposition are examined and quantified as a function of temperature, light intensity, blend composition, and time. The activation energy for photodimerization is estimated to be 0.021(3) eV, considerably smaller than that for decomposition (0.96 eV). The findings are benchmarked with a variety of conjugated polymer matrices to propose a descriptive dynamic model of PCBM:dimer population in OSCs, and a framework is proposed to rationalize its interplay with morphology evolution and charge quenching. The model and parameters enable the prediction of the dynamic and long-term PCBM:dimer populations, under variable temperature and light conditions, which impact the morphological stability of OSCs.									7	0	0	0	1	0	7			1614-6832	1614-6840		WOS:000471339300008

Photocatalytic decomposition of soot from the isooctane and 2,5-dimethylfuran (DMF) flames was carried out under vacuum ultraviolet irradiation. The change of PEG addition led to different morphology of titanium dioxide films as the photocatalysts, which might affect photocatalytic soot decomposition. The photodegradation process of soot was analyzed by digital cameras, the field emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM) analysis, and the higher resolution transmission electron microscope (HRTEM) analysis. The photocatalytic degradation time of soot from DMF flames is far fewer than that of soot from isooctane flames. Loose deposition of DMF soot is beneficial for the photocatalytic decomposition process due to the blocking to incident light reducing. Nanostructures of soot particles from different flames were obtained and analyzed by HRTEM. Soot samples that were collected by DMF flames exhibited higher oxidation reactivity and more surface oxygen than that from isooctane flames. The above factors which might affect the photocatalytic degradation time of soot were analyzed to compare differences.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			1536-383X	1536-4046		WOS:000494253600001

Structural and pore structural characterizations prove that metal ions do not dope into the frameworks of TiO2 nanosheets. Through TEM and STEM, we can determine that clusters with similar to 2 nm size are finely dispersed on TiO2 nanosheets. PL spectra and photoelectrochemical measurements suggest that these metal oxide clusters can serve as hole traps. Time-resolved PL spectra demonstrate that the charge-transfer process in TM-TiO2 is significantly accelerated, leading to higher charge separation efficiency. Metal oxide clusters show significant promotion effect in photocatalytic water oxidation to 02 compared to RuO2/TiO2 and IrO2/TiO2 nanosheets (denoted as Ru-TiO2(IM) and Ir-TiO2(IM)) prepared through conventional impregnation method. We also prepared RuO2/TiO2 and Ir/TiO2 nanosheets (denoted as Ru-TiO2(HT) and IrTiO2(HT)) through the in situ loading method. Ru-TiO2(HT) and Ir-TiO2(HT) show O-2 evolution rates much better than those of Ru-TiO2(IM) and Ir-TiO2(IM) due to the smaller sizes of RuO2 and IrO2. However, Mn-TiO2 and Co-TiO2 still display better photoactivities compared to those of Ru-TiO2(HT) and Ir-TiO2(HT). These results indicate that transition metal oxides with small sizes can also work as co-catalysts in photocatalysis to substitute noble metal oxides.									138	11	0	0	8	0	141			2155-5435			WOS:000330016800018

N and O co-doped helical carbon nanotubes encapsulated with CoFe alloy (CoFe@NO-CNT) were prepared in situ on carbon paper using ZIF67 as precursor through ion exchange and chemical vapor deposition (CVD) pyrolysis methods. Comparative studies found that the heterogeneous catalysis of CoFe alloy produced spiral carbon nanotubes, which had a much higher N and O doping content than conventional carbon nanotubes containing monometallic cobalt particles. On the basis of the advantages of in situ growth and 3D open structure of catalytic electrode, the helical carbon nanotubes with abundant N catalytic species, C = O functional groups and core-shell structure exhibit su-perior electrocatalytic activity for ORR/OER/HER. The zinc-air battery (ZAB) and water electrolysis device based on CoFe@NO-CNT electrodes showed peak power density (142 mW/cm(2)), specific capacity (819 mAh/gZn), low overall water splitting voltage (1.57 v @ 10 mA/cm(2)) and good stability. Two CoFe@NO-CNT based ZABs in serial connection can efficiently drive the electrolyzer with two same CoFe@NO-CNT/CFP electrodes to split water and two quasi-solid state ZABs in series provide a peak power of 212 mW to light a red light-emitting diode (LED) indicator.

In this study, we investigated the variation characteristics of the pore structure of coal samples by combining scanning electrical microscopy with mercury intrusion porosimetry analysis, to better understand the structural evolution characteristics of middle-high rank coal subjected to HVEP. Furthermore, changes in the chemical structure of the coal samples before and after HVEP treatment were investigated by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy analysis. The results show that, under the action of HVEP, both anthracite and bituminous coal samples can be crushed into many small pieces. Because the conductivity of anthracite coal samples is better than that of bituminous coal samples, the average breakdown voltage of anthracite coal samples is lower than that of bituminous coal samples. It was found that the greater the breakdown voltage, the more the number of particles formed after the coal is broken and the smaller the particle diameter. At the same time, many pores and cracks were generated in the middle-high rank coal subjected to HVEP. In particular, the meso- and macropores of coal samples subjected to HVEP are clearly higher than those of raw coal samples. The fractal dimensions of seepage pores of coal samples subjected to HVEP are bigger than those of raw coal samples. The increased pores and cracks are conducive to the release and migration of methane. In addition, oxidation reactions occur on the surface of coal subjected to HVEP. Following HVEP treatment, the surface chemical structure of both anthracite and bituminous coal showed significant changes; importantly, the concentration of oxygen-containing functional groups increased, which benefits methane release.									54	4	0	0	0	0	56			0887-0624	1520-5029		WOS:000428003800062

Simultaneously, three-dimensional (3D) hierarchical structure can afford large surface area and abundant reactive sites, contributing to high efficiency. Herein, we report an absorbing single-unit-cell layer established Bi2WO6 3D hierarchical architecture fabricated by a sodium dodecyl benzene sulfonate (SDBS)-assisted assembled strategy. The DBS- long chains can adsorb on the (Bi2O2)(2+) layers and hence impede stacking of the layers, resulting in the single-unit-cell layer. We also uncovered that SDS with a shorter chain is less effective than SDBS. Due to the sufficient exposure of surface O atoms, single-unit-cell layer 3D Bi2WO6 shows strong selectivity for adsorption on multiform organic dyes with different charges. Remarkably, the single-unit-cell layer 3D Bi2WO6 casts profoundly enhanced photodegradation activity and especially a superior photocatalytic H-2 evolution rate, which is 14-fold increase in contrast to the bulk Bi2WO6. Systematic photoelectrochemical characterizations disclose that the substantially elevated carrier density and charge separation efficiency take responsibility for the strengthened photocatalytic performance. Additionally, the possibility of single-unit-cell layer 3D Bi2WO6 as dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSC) has also been attempted and it was manifested to be a promising dye-sensitized photoanode for oxygen evolution reaction (ORR). Our work not only furnish an insight into designing single-layer assembled 3D hierarchical architecture, but also offer a multi-functional material for environmental and energy applications.

Electrocatalytic water oxidation at pH 7 occurs at an overpotential of 550 mV with a turnover frequency of similar to 19 s(-1) at 1.5 V vs NHE. Controlled potential electrolysis (CPE) experiments at pH 11.5 over 3 h at 1.2 V and at pH 8.1 for 40 min at 1.37 V vs NHE confirm the evolution of dioxygen with Faradaic efficiencies of 81% and 45%, respectively. Rinse tests conducted after CPE studies provide evidence for the homogeneous nature of the catalysis. The linear dependence of the current density on the catalyst concentration indicates a likely first-order dependence on the Cu precatalyst 1, while kinetic isotope studies (H2O versus D2O) point to involvement of a proton in or preceding the rate-determining step. Rotating ring-disk electrode measurements at pH 8.1 and 11.2 show no evidence of H2O2 formation and support selectivity to form dioxygen. Freeze-quench electron paramagnetic resonance studies during electrolysis provide evidence for the formation of a molecular copper intermediate. Experimental and computational studies support a key role of the phosphate as an acceptor base. Moreover, density functional theory calculations highlight the importance of second-sphere interactions and the role of the nitrogen-based ligands to facilitate proton transfer processes.									11	0	0	0	0	0	11			2155-5435			WOS:000664333800044

The electrical response of the matching network and the electrical model circuit chamber was taken into account.					2nd Conference on Laser and Plasma Applications in Materials Science2nd Conference on Laser and Plasma Applications in Materials Science	NOV 27-30, 2010NOV 27-30, 2010	Gen Directorate Sci Res & Technol Dev; Natl Agcy Dev Univ Res; Int Atom Energy Agcy; Weld & Control Ctr; Condor Elect Algeria; LAM Network; French Embassy Algeria; Ctr Res Sci & Tech Informat; African Laser CtrGen Directorate Sci Res & Technol Dev; Natl Agcy Dev Univ Res; Int Atom Energy Agcy; Weld & Control Ctr; Condor Elect Algeria; LAM Network; French Embassy Algeria; Ctr Res Sci & Tech Informat; African Laser Ctr	Algiers, ALGERIAAlgiers, ALGERIA	1	0	0	0	0	0	1			1022-6680		978-3-03785-107-4	WOS:000292658900039

Cu+PdO composites with a low dispersed phase content were obtained from either basic pyrophosphate or acid sulfate baths. Codeposition of PdO particles with a Cu-Pd alloy matrix was effectively achieved by electrolyzing suspensions of PdO in solutions containing both Cu2+ and Pd2+ ions, with large [Cu2+]/[Pd2+] ratios. (Cu-Pd)+PdO deposits with 20-25 Pd atom % were obtained in which only 1-2 atom % of Pd were alloyed in the matrix. These (Cu-Pd)+PdO composites were mechanically stable and highly porous throughout their thickness (their pore volume being ca. 60% of the total volume). Their true surface area was some thousands of times higher than their geometric area.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0013-4651	1945-7111		WOS:000275586800061

It is shown that the GDL actively participates in ORR during discharge conditions and, if its mass is not accounted for, can lead to inflated discharge capacity figures compared to inert cathode supports. SEM and XRD analyses show that Li2O2 discharge products form on cathodes composed of as-received GDL in a similar manner to that observed for carbon on stainless steel (SS) current collectors (at applied currents of 100 mu A cm(-2) or less). The relative activity of the GDL, carbon on GDL and carbon-on-stainless steel current collectors from voltammetric measurements confirmed ORR and OER processes to be similar at all carbon-based surfaces. When heated above 300 degrees C, degradation of the binder in the GDL and associated loss of carbon from the substrate surface leads to reduced discharge times compared to the pristine GDL substrates. The data highlight the importance of the contribution to ORR/OER in carbon-based active current collector substrates when determining gravimetric capacities of Li-O-2 batteries.

Herein, we propose a morphology and surface-electronic-structure reconstruction strategy to realize the anchoring of Pt nanoparticles (NPs) on Co3O4-8-carbon matrix via the co-reduction of Pt precursor and Co3O4-carbon formed by direct pyrolysis of an aerogel composed of cobalt nitrate, chitosan, and urea. The transformation of the porous-network to hierarchically porous structure consisted of Co3O4-delta-carbon nanosheets, deposition of electron-rich Pt NPs, and generation of abundant oxygen-vacancy are facilely achieved through flexible co-reduction of Pt(IV) ions and Co3O4-carbon with ammonia borane (AB). The achieved Pt/Co3O4-delta-UC with an ultralow Pt loading (0.1 wt%) exhibits an ultrahigh activity for hydrolytic AB dehydrogenation with turnover frequencies of 7700 min(-1) in aqueous solution at 25 celcius. This catalyst also has a high durability with 71.3% remained activity after ten repetitive cycles. The morphology and surface-electronic-structure reconstruction engaged formation of electron-efficient Pt species could accelerate the oxidative cleavage of O - H bond in H2O and greatly boost the hydrogen generation from hydrolytic AB dehydrogenation. This strategy presented herein offers a new pathway for constructing ultra-highly active supported metal NPs toward hydrogen evolution reaction.									5	0	0	0	1	0	5			0016-2361	1873-7153		WOS:000783209700005

UV - Raman spectra of immature terrestrial kerogens and coals are distinct from those of extraterrestrial kerogens extracted from type 1 and 2 primitive chondrites, allowing unambiguous identification. The degree of disorder in the refractory carbonaceous matter in the considered IDPs is found to be higher than in primitive chondrites, confirming former interpretation of visible (514 nm-excitation) Raman spectra of IDPs. Spectral and structural features of laboratory analogues of chondritic organic matter formed in cold plasma reactors at 500-700 degrees C differ from those of natural samples, challenging the hypothesis that chondritic organic matter within the protosolar disk may form through plasma reactions. Finally, UV Raman data shed new light in the structural evolution of coals during maturation and support the presence of an sp 2 structural transition at vitrinite reflectance Ro similar to 0.4-0.5%. Comparison with former visible Raman and infrared spectroscopic data confirms the exis- tence of this structural transition, which is related to a dramatic drop of oxygenated species (carboxyl, hydroxyl, ketone and ether groups). Oxygen thus plays an indirect but significant role in the control of the Raman spectra of polyaromatic mate- rials. A potential application of this technique is the determination of the biotic versus abiotic origin of kerogens in ancient rocks on Earth, and of soils and rocks on Mars that is otherwise difficult with classical visible -excitation Raman spectroscopy.

Part 2: hydrogen production								RSC ADVANCES				10	62			37947	37955		10.1039/d0ra03954c				OCT 14 2020	2020	In this work, results concerning hydrogen gas production during the oxidation of methyl red (MR) and sodium 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetate (2,4-DNa), is presented, emphasizing not only the amount of hydrogen gas that was produced but also the kinetic and efficiency parameters involved in this process. For this purpose, a two-compartment electrochemical cell was used with a Nafion (R) membrane as separator in order to collect H-2 without other chemical species (only with traces of water vapor). Under these experimental conditions, it was possible to guarantee the purity of the H-2 collected. The electrochemical oxidation of MR and 2,4-DNa solutions was carried out by applying 30 mA cm(-2) at 298 K, using different non-active anodes (Si/BDD, Pb/PbO2, or Sb-doped SnO2) and different cathodes (Pt mesh, 316-type stainless-steel, or Pt-10%Rh) in order to investigate the effect of the electrocatalytic materials and experimental conditions. Thus, the H-2 produced was measured as a function of the electrolysis time and compared with the values estimated by Faraday's law. The results showed that the hydrogen production rate r(H-2) is independent of the nature of the anodic material, although an important effect on the oxygen production was observed on the BDD anode by using sulfuric acid as supporting electrolyte. The effect was discussed through the formation of sulphate-oxidizing species (SO(4)(-)and S2O82-) which interfere in the oxygen production step on BDD anodes. The use of different cathodes showed small changes in the hydrogen production rate r(H-2), which were basically associated with the differences in hydrogen adsorption energy prior to its evolution. The results were discussed in light of the existing literature.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5				2046-2069		WOS:000583523300043	35515156

Stable isotope geochemistry of limestone and evaporite units indicates a strong paleogeographic influence on the chemistry of the water column. Near-shore limestone at the base of the Boleo Formation is characterized by modified marine carbon (delta C-13(PDB) = -6.0 to +4.4 parts per thousand) and oxygen (delta(OMOW)-O-18 = +19.5 to +26.2 parts per thousand) isotope composition due to the influx of C-13- and O-18-depleted fluvial water. Sulfate sulfur isotope composition (delta S-34(CDT) = +17.21 to +22.3 parts per thousand and delta O-18(SMOW) = +10.7 to +13.1 parts per thousand) for basal evaporite and claystone facies are similar to Miocene seawater. Strontium isotopes are less radiogenic than expected for Miocene seawater due to interaction with volcanic rocks. Low S/C ratios, high Mn contents and sedimentological evidence indicate the basin water column was oxidizing. The oxygenated basin restricted sulfide precipitation to within the sedimentary pile by replacement of early diagenetic framboidal pyrite and pore-space filling by Cu-Co-Zn sulfides to produce disseminated sulfides. Quartz-Mn oxide oxygen isotope geothermometry constrains mineralization temperature between 18 and 118 degrees C. Sulfur isotopes indicate the following sources of sulfide: (1) bacterial sulfate reduction within the sedimentary pile produced negative delta S-34 values ( < -20 parts per thousand) in framboidal pyrite; and (2) bacterial sulfate reduction at high temperature (80-118 degrees C) within the sedimentary pile during the infiltration of the metal-bearing brines produced Cu-Co-Zn sulfides with negative, but close to O parts per thousand, delta S-34 values. Isotope modeling of fluid-rock reaction and fluid mixing indicates: (1) sedimentary and marine carbonates (delta C-13=-11.6 to -3.2 parts per thousand and delta O-18=+19.0 to +21.8 parts per thousand) precipitated from basin seawater/ pore water that variably mixed with isotopically depleted meteoric waters; and (2) hydrothermal calcite (delta C-13=-7.9 to +4.3 parts per thousand and delta O-18=+22.1 to +25.8 parts per thousand) formed by dissolution and replacement of authigenic marine calcite by downward-infiltrating metalliferous brine and brine-sediment exchange, that prior to reaction with calcite, had mixed with isotopically depleted pore water. The downward infiltration of metalliferous brine is inferred from lateral and stratigraphic metal distributions and from the concentration of Cu sulfides along the upper contact of pyrite-bearing laminae. The co-existence and textural relationships among framboidal pyrite, base metal sulfides, carbonate and Mn-Fe oxides (including magnetite) within mineralized units are consistent with carbonate replacement and high-temperature bacterial reduction within the sedimentary pile occurring simultaneously below a seawater column under predominantly oxygenated conditions.									12	0	0	0	2	2	12			0026-4598			WOS:000238356800002

Herein, CdS-decorated surface-coarsened TiO2 nanobelts were fabricated by in-situ-deposited CdS on the surface-coarsened TiO2 nanobelts prepared by hydrothermal procedure followed by acid etched, and the visible-light photocatalytic performances were investigated. The as-synthesized composites presented multi-crystalline phase heterostructure with the specific surface of 64.368 m(2) g(-1) and the band gap of 2.22 eV. Owing to the synergic effect between CdS and surface-coarsened TiO2 nanobelts with multi-crystalline phase self-transformed heterostructure, the prepared composites showed effective separation of photogenerated carriers and excellent visible-light photocatalytic performances. Under visible-light irradiation, the degradation efficiency of methylene blue reached 99.7% with the photodegradation rate constant of 0.0231 min(-1), and the average H-2 evolution rate was 0.6225 mmol g(-1) h(-1) over 6 h. The visible-light photocatalytic activities of the as-prepared composites were greatly enhanced compared to CdS and CdS-decorated TiO2 nanobelts. The possible photodegradation mechanism was provided by investigating the active species.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			0957-4522	1573-482X		WOS:000518115700005

Photocatalytic hydrogen evolution (HER) is a sustainable and promising way to generate hydrogen. Despite of great achievements in photocatalytic HER research, its efficiency is still limited due to undesirable electron transfer loss, high HER over-potential and low stability of some photocatalysts, which lead to their unsatisfied performance in HER and anti-photocorrosion properties. In recent years, many spintronics works have shown their enhancing effects on photo-catalytic HER. For example, it was reported that spin polarized photo-electrons could result in higher photocurrents and HER turnover frequency (up to 200%) in photocatalytic system. Two strategies have been developed for electron spin polarizing, which resort to heavy atom effect and magnetic induction respectively. Both theoretical and experimental studies show that controlling spin state of OH center dot radicals in photocatalytic reaction can not only decrease OER over-potential (even to 0 eV) of water splitting, but improve stability and charge lifetime of photocatalysts. A convenient strategy have been developed for aligning spin state of OH center dot by utilizing chiral molecules to spin filter photo-electrons. By chiral-induced spin filtering, electron polarization can approach to 74%, which is significantly larger than some traditional transition metal devices. Those achievements demonstrate bright future of spintronics in enhancing photocatalytic HER, nevertheless, there is little work systematically reviewing and analysis this topic. This review focuses on recent achievements of spintronics in photocatalytic HER study, and systematically summarizes the related mechanisms and important strategies proposed. Besides, the challenges and developing trends of spintronics enhanced photo-catalytic HER research are discussed, expecting to comprehend and explore such interdisciplinary research in photocatalytic HER.

Here, we fabricated ternary NiFe-P nanosheets on carbon fiber paper as efficient electrodes and studied the local atomic and electronic structure alteration through X-ray absorption spectroscopy. The optimized ternary Ni-Fe-P nanosheet electrode exhibited superior hydrogen evolution activity and stability in 0.5 M H2SO4 with a low overpotential of 56 mV at 10 mA cm(-2). X-ray absorption spectroscopy studies revealed that with the Fe ion incorporation into the system, the Ni-P bonds elongated and few electrons transferred from Ni to P which resulted in a reduced oxidation state of Ni and reduced the interaction between the hydrogen atom and the catalyst surface. Our work not only demonstrates the future potential of high-performance electrocatalysts based on ternary Ni-Fe-P but also offers a promising method to explore the unique synergistic effect in ternary compounds.									14	0	0	0	0	0	14			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000465189000025	30919614

The full discharge of batteries in the 2-4.5 V range showed 6-fold increase in the first discharge cycle of the Pd-filled over the pristine CNTs and 35% increase over their Pd-coated counterparts. The Pd-filled also exhibited improved cyclability with 58 full cycles of 500 mAh . g(-1) at current density of 250 mA . g(-1) versus 35 and 43 cycles for pristine and Pd-coated CNTs, respectively. In this work, the effect of encapsulating the Pd catalysts inside the CNTs proved to increase the stability of the electrolyte during both discharging and charging. Voltammetry, Raman spectroscopy, FTIR, XRD, UV/Vis spectroscopy and visual inspection of the discharge products using scanning electron microscopy confirmed the improved stability of the electrolyte due to this encapsulation and suggest that this approach could lead increasing the Li-O-2 battery capacity and cyclability performance.

These exceptional properties have led to the exploration of the roles of branch structural features ranging from the number and dimensions of branches at the larger scales to the atomic-scale arrangement of atoms on precise crystal facets. The fundamental significance of how larger-scale branch structural features and atomic-scale surface faceting influence and control the catalytic properties has been at the forefront of the design of branched nanoparticles for catalysis. Current synthetic advances have enabled the formation of branched nanoparticles with an unprecedented degree of control over structural features down to the atomic scale, which have unlocked opportunities to make improved nanoparticle catalysts. These catalysts have high surface areas with controlled size and surface facets for achieving exceedingly high activity and stability. The synthetic advancement has recently led to the use of branched nanoparticles as ideal substrates that can be decorated with a second active metal in the form of islands and single atoms. These decorated branched nanoparticles have new and highly effective catalytic active sites where both branch metal and decorating metal play essential roles during catalysis. In the opening half of this Account, we critically assess the important structural features of branched nanoparticles that control catalytic properties. We first discuss the role of branch dimensions and the number of branches that can improve the surface area but can also trap gas bubbles. We then investigate the atomic-scale structural features of exposed surface facets, which are critical for enhancing catalytic activity and stability. Well-defined branched nanoparticles have led to a fundamental understanding of how the branch structural features influence the catalytic activity and stability, which we highlight for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and biomass oxidation. In discussing recent breakthroughs for branched nanoparticles, we explore the opportunities created by decorated branched nanoparticles and the unique bifunctional active sites that are exposed on the branched nanoparticle surfaces. This class of catalysts is of rapidly growing importance for reactions including the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and methanol oxidation reaction (MOR), where two exposed metals are required for efficient catalysis. In the second half of this Account, we explore recent advances in the synthesis of branched nanoparticles and highlight the cubic-core hexagonal-branch growth mechanism that has achieved excellent control of all of the important structural features, including branch dimensions, number of branches, and surface facets. We discuss the slow precursor reduction as an effective strategy for decorating metal islands with controlled loadings on the branched nanoparticle surfaces and the spread of these metal islands to form single-atom active sites. We envisage that the key synthetic and structural advances identified in this Account will guide the development of the next-generation electrocatalysts.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0001-4842	1520-4898		WOS:000818967100001	35616935

Applications on computational datasets and a handful of optimization experiments have demonstrated the promise of SL, motivating a quantitative evaluation of its ability to accelerate materials discovery, specifically in the case of physical experiments. The benchmarking effort in the present work quantifies the performance of SL algorithms with respect to a breadth of research goals: discovery of any "good" material, discovery of all "good" materials, and discovery of a model that accurately predicts the performance of new materials. To benchmark the effectiveness of different machine learning models against these goals, we use datasets in which the performance of all materials in the search space is known from high-throughput synthesis and electrochemistry experiments. Each dataset contains all pseudo-quaternary metal oxide combinations from a set of six elements (chemical space), the performance metric chosen is the electrocatalytic activity (overpotential) for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). A diverse set of SL schemes is tested on four chemical spaces, each containing 2121 catalysts. The presented work suggests that research can be accelerated by up to a factor of 20 compared to random acquisition in specific scenarios. The results also show that certain choices of SL models are ill-suited for a given research goal resulting in substantial deceleration compared to random acquisition methods. The results provide quantitative guidance on how to tune an SL strategy for a given research goal and demonstrate the need for a new generation of materials-aware SL algorithms to further accelerate materials discovery.									38	0	0	0	2	0	38			2041-6520	2041-6539		WOS:000519742300008	34084328

The designed 1T'-MoS2/g-C3N4 composite exhibits significant enhancement than pure g-C3N4 and 2H-MoS2/g-C3N4. The 1T'-MoS2/g-C3N4 composite with optimum 20 wt% 1T'-MoS2 displays a significantly improved photocatalytic H-2 production rate (4426 mu mol.h(-1).g(-1)), which is about 86.7 and 1.41 times of pure g-C3N4 and 20 wt%-2H-MoS2/g-C3N4 composite, along with excellent stability. Besides, the apparent quantum efficiency (AQE) of 1T'-MoS2/g-C3N4 composite (20 wt%) achieves 13.55%. 1T'-MoS2 co-catalysts not only serve as effective electron acceptors, but have the merits of the energetically more stable.									46	0	0	0	6	0	46			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000551969200137

Recent Advances in Self-Supported Semiconductor Heterojunction Nanoarrays as Efficient Photoanodes for Photoelectrochemical Water Splitting								SMALL										2204553	10.1002/smll.202204553		SEP 2022			2022	Growth of semiconductor heterojunction nanoarrays directly on conductive substrates represents a promising strategy toward high-performance photoelectrodes for photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting. By controlling the growth conditions, heterojunction nanoarrays with different morphologies and semiconductor components can be fabricated, resulting in greatly enhanced light-absorption properties, stabilities, and PEC activities. Herein, recent progress in the development of self-supported heterostructured semiconductor nanoarrays as efficient photoanode catalysts for water oxidation is reviewed. Synthetic methods for the fabrication of heterojunction nanoarrays with specific compositions and structures are first discussed, including templating methods, wet chemical syntheses, electrochemical approaches and chemical vapor deposition (CVD) methods. Then, various heterojunction nanoarrays that have been reported in recent years based on particular core semiconductor scaffolds (e.g., TiO2, ZnO, WO3, Fe2O3, etc.) are summarized, placing strong emphasis on the synergies generated at the interface between the semiconductor components that can favorably boost PEC water oxidation. Whilst strong progress has been made in recent years to enhance the visible-light responsiveness, photon-to-O-2 conversion efficiency and stability of photoanodes based on heterojunction nanoarrays, further advancements in all these areas are needed for PEC water splitting to gain any traction alongside photovoltaic-electrochemical (PV-EC) systems as a viable and cost-effective route toward the hydrogen economy.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1613-6810	1613-6829		WOS:000856198100001	36135974

The versatile coassembly in dual n-hexane/THF solvent solution enables the fomation of poly(ethylene oxide)-b-polystyrene (PEO-b-PS)/POMs (e.g., silicotungstic acid, H4SiW12O40) nanocomposites with different morphologies such as spherical vesicles, inverse spherical micelles, and inverse cylindrical micelles, which can be readily converted into diverse nanostructured metal oxides with high surface area and unique properties via in situ thermal-induced structural evolution. For example, uniform silicon-doped WO3 (Si-WO3) hollow hemispheres derived from coassembly of PEO-b-PS with H4SiW12O40 were utilized to fabricate gas sensing devices which exhibit superior gas sensing performance toward acetone, thanks to the selective gas- solid interface catalytic reaction that induces resistance changes of the devices due to the high specific surface areas, abundant oxygen vacancies, and the Si-doping induced metastable epsilon-phase of WO3. Furthermore, density functional theory (DFT) calculation reveals the mechanism about the high sensitivity and selectivity of the gas sensors. On the basis of the as-fabricated devices, an integrated gas sensor module was constructed, which is capable of real-time monitoring the environmental acetone concentration and displaying relevant sensing results on a smart phone via Bluetooth communication.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2374-7943	2374-7951		WOS:000834237700001	36032768	
J	WATERLAND, RA; BASU, A; CHANCE, B; POYTON, RO								THE ISOFORMS OF YEAST CYTOCHROME-C-OXIDASE SUBUNIT-V ALTER THE INVIVO KINETIC-PROPERTIES OF THE HOLOENZYME								JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL CHEMISTRY				266	7			4180	4186						MAR 5 1991	1991	One of the nuclear-coded subunits of yeast cytochrome c oxidase is specified by a gene family composed of two genes, COX5a and COX5b. These genes are regulated differentially by oxygen and encode isoforms of subunit V, designated Va and Vb, which have only 66% primary sequence identity. Yeast cells require one or the other isoform for a functional cytochrome c oxidase (Trueblood, C. E., and Poyton, R. O. (1987) Mol. Cell Biol. 7, 3520-3526). To determine if these isoforms of subunit V alter the catalytic properties of holocytochrome c oxidase, we have analyzed various aspects of cytochrome c oxidase function in intact yeast cells that produce only one type of isoform. From measurements of room temperature turnover numbers and low temperature rates of ligand binding, single turnover cytochrome c oxidation, and internal electron transfer (heme a oxidation), we have found that isozymes which incorporate the Vb isoform have both higher turnover rates and higher rates of heme a oxidation than isozymes which incorporate Va. These findings support the conclusion that the isoforms of subunit V modulate cytochrome c oxidase activity in vivo and suggest that they do so by altering the rates of one or more intramolecular electron transfer reactions.									69	1	0	0	62	0	70			0021-9258	1083-351X		WOS:A1991FA69400028	1847916

In this study, we compared the internal defense systems in two subspecies of the land snail Cornu aspersum that exhibit contrasting life-history strategies. The "fast-living" Cornu aspersum subsp. aspersa is widespread throughout the world, especially in ecosystems disturbed by man, whereas natural populations of the giant Cornu aspersum subsp. maxima, characterized by a longer life span, are present only in north Africa. Snails were experimentally challenged with Escherichia coli; the measurements used to assess their internal defense for cell-and humoral-mediated immune responses were bacterial clearance, hemocyte density, reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, and plasma antibacterial activity. Both subspecies showed a similar ability to clear bacteria from their hemolymph; however, they varied in the robustness of different individual immune components. Cornu aspersum aspersa had higher ROS activity than did C. a. maxima and lower plasma bactericidal activity. These results suggest that ecological factors can sculpt the immune response. One interpretation is that shorter life span selects for immune defenses such as ROS that, although effective, can cause long-term damage. Such different immune patterns obviously entail various costs involved in the strong intraspecific variation of life-history trade-offs we previously observed. We also have to consider that such variation might be related to intraspecific differences in the relative strength of resistance and tolerance mechanisms.									2	0	0	0	2	0	2			1522-2152	1537-5293		WOS:000287648600010	21460532

With this aim, Milstein and co-workers developed a PNP pincer ruthenium catalyst for the homogeneous hydrogenation of nitrous oxide (N2O), an ozone-depleting substance and the third most important greenhouse gas, to generate dinitrogen and water as resultant products. The mechanism of this promising transformation was unveiled by means of experiments together with density functional theory (DFT) calculations, which inspired Milstein and co-workers to use similar (PNN)Ru-H pincer catalysts for the reduction of N2O by CO to produce N-2 and CO2. The use of the latter type of catalysts resulted in the proposition of a new reaction protocol and allowed to work under milder conditions. Here we describe the detailed mechanism of the last transformation catalyzed by a (PNN)Ru-H catalyst by means of DFT calculations, and not only this, but we also discover the way to block undesired parasitic reactions. Apart from that, we have explored a new evolution of this family of catalysts to go beyond previous experimental outcomes. The mechanism consists of a cascade of easy steps, starting from an insertion of the N2O oxygen into the Ru-H bond generating a hydroxo intermediate and releasing N-2 and ending with a beta-hydride elimination to form CO2 and regenerate the catalyst. The whole process occurs in a facile way with the exception of two steps: the formation of the hydroxyl ligand and the final beta-hydride elimination to form CO2. However, the energy barriers of these two steps are not the bottleneck in the catalysis but rather the ease of the pyridyl group bonded to Ru to isomerize by C-H activation. We propose to solve this drawback by tuning the PNN ligand to block the pyridyl free rotation.									7	0	0	0	0	0	7			0020-1669	1520-510X		WOS:000548456300077	32574492

Simultaneously, an anatase/rutile phase-junction was also obtained due to the crystalline phase transformation that occurred during high-temperature calcination. The unique hetero-junction and phase-junction lead to the formation of an intimate interface and large contact area between two semiconductors and extended the visible-light absorption range. Therefore, BCN-TiO2(A + R) heterojunctions with a mixed anatase and rutile phase exhibit enhanced photocarrier separation efficiency, realizing an elevenfold increase in the electron lifetime compared to that of pure TiO2 and yielding a remarkable visible-light-driven H-2 evolution rate nearly 7.5 and 12.2 times higher than that of TiO2(A + R) and pure BCN, respectively. This work provides a new strategy for designing efficient water-splitting photocatalysts with highly efficient charge separation and transfer.									12	0	0	0	1	0	12			0009-2614	1873-4448		WOS:000467541600003

Two transitions in the R-branch of the fundamental vibrational band of HCl near 3.34 mu m are selected due to their relative strength and spectral isolation from other combustion products at elevated temperatu res, and they are probed using a distributed feedback interband cascade laser. A scanned-wavelength direct absorption method is employed with a Voigt line-fitting routine to recover projected absorbance areas across the exit plane of a cylindrical polymeric slab, wherein the gaseous core comprises the axisymmetric reaction layer. Tikhonov-regularized Abel inversion of the projected absorbance areas yields line-integrated radial absorption coefficients, from which a two-line ratio is used to infer a radially resolved temperature between the gas core and solid polymer surface. The method is demonstrated to provide insights into the gas-phase combustion physics that lead to the formation of toxicants when a fire-resistant polymer, polyvinyl chloride (PVC), is burned in the presence of oxygen. Two-dimensional images were generated by assembling multiple tomographic reconstructions for several cylinder lengths. The quantitative images highlight the technique's ability to characterize the thermochemical evolution and toxicant formation during the burning of a halogenated polymer fuel.

The present work follows this trend, reporting a silver nanoparticles/single-walled carbon nanotubesbased composite electrode (AgNP/SWCNT-CPE) that has multiple functionalities for dienestrol (DNL) electroanalysis. Theoretical and experimental data indicate that DNL reactivity on AgNP/SWCNT-CPE is more critical under acidic conditions, favoring its irreversible oxidation to quinone derivatives. The reaction kinetics is limited by interfacial adsorption events, whose intensity of the molecule-surface interaction depends on variables such as Gibbs free energy, ionization potential, HOMO-LUMO gap, and dipole moment. Since the silver?carbon heterojunction has low overpotential towards the oxygen evolution reaction, it is speculated that AgNP/SWCNT-CPE is more resistant to surface fouling due to the formation of chemisorbed radicals on its electroactive area. Based on the detection limit (43.7 nmol L?1 DNL), the analytical performance of the proposed method is equivalent to those attained by chemiluminescence, electrophoresis, chromatography and electrochemistry. Given the sensitivity obtained, AgNP/SWCNTCPE was successfully used to quantify DNL in river waters containing different levels of organic matter, without compromising the accuracy, stability and robustness of the amperometric measurements, reiterating the reliability and feasibility of this proposal.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			1572-6657	1873-2569		WOS:000639614400008

As an alternative, O2-type materials show the potential to improve the oxygen redox reversibility and structural stability. However, their structure-performance relationship is still unclear. Here, we investigate the correlation between the Li component and dynamic chemical reversibility of O2-type Li-rich materials. By exploring the formation mechanism of a series of materials prepared by Na/Li exchange, we reveal that insufficient Li leads to an incomplete replacement, and the residual Na in the Li-layer would hinder the fast diffusion of Li+. Moreover, excessive Li induces the extraction of interlayer Li during the melting chemical reaction stage, resulting in a reduction in the valence of Mn, which leads to a severe Jahn-Teller effect. Structural detection confirms that the regulation of Li can improve the cycle stability of Li-rich materials and suppress the trend of voltage fading. The reversible phase evolution observed in in-situ X-ray diffraction confirms the excellent structural stability of the optimized material, which is conducive to capacity retention. This work highlights the significance of modulating dynamic electrochemical performance through the intrinsic structure.

Potentiodynamic E/i anodic curves exhibit active passive transition prior to an oxygen evolution reaction. The active region involves a small peak BI followed by a major peak All before the passive region. Peak AI is assigned to the formation of an Ag2O layer while peak All is due to the formation of an Ag2CO3 layer. The height of the anodic peaks increases with increasing Na3CO3 concentration, scan rate: and temperature. The effect of increasing additions of NaClO4 on the electrochemical behaviour of Ag in Na2CO3 solutions was investigated. The perchlorate ions stimulate the active dissolution of Ag, presumably as a result of the formation of soluble AgClO4 salt. In the passive region, ClO4- ions tend to break down the dual passive film, leading to pitting corrosion at a certain critical pitting potential. The pitting potential decreases with ClO4- concentration. Potentiostatic current/time transients showed that the formation of Ag2O and Ag2CO3 layers involves a nucleation and growth mechanism under diffusion control, However, in the presence of ClO4 ions, the incubation time for pit initiation decreases on increasing the anodic potential step.									16	2	0	0	0	0	17			1432-8488			WOS:000082855500003

The distance between the magnet and the anode surface is controlled by a linear actuator, enabling submillimeter distance positioning of the magnet relative to the anode surface. We couple this apparatus with a finite element analysis magnetic model that was validated by Hall probe measurements to determine the value of beta at the anode surface. At the largest tested magnetic field strength of beta = 371 +/- 1 mT, a 4.7% increase in current at 1.5 V vs the normal hydrogen electrode (NHE) and a change in the Tafel slope of 14.5 mV/dec were observed. We demonstrate through a series of OER measurements at sequential values of beta that the enhancement consists of two distinct regions. The possible use of this effect to improve the energy efficiency of commercial water electrolyzers is discussed, and major challenges pertaining to the accurate measurement of the phenomenon are demonstrated.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			0002-7863	1520-5126		WOS:000744241500001	35000393	
J	Nandjou, Fredy; Haussener, Sophia								Modeling the Photostability of Solar Water-Splitting Devices and Stabilization Strategies								ACS APPLIED MATERIALS & INTERFACES											10.1021/acsami.2c08204		SEP 2022			2022	The practical implementation of photoelectrochemical devices for hydrogen generation is limited by their short lifetimes. Understanding the factors affecting the stability of the heterogeneous photoelectrodes is required to formulate degradation mitigation strategies. We developed a multiscale and multiphysics model to investigate and quantify the photostability of photoelectrodes. The model considers the photophysical processes in an electrocatalyst-coated semiconductor immersed in electrolyte, and the kinetics of the competing water-splitting and photocorrosion reactions. When applied to 12 promising compound semiconductors for use as photoanodes (GaAs, GaP, InP, GaN, SiC, AlP, AlAs, CdTe, CdS, CdSe, ZnS, and ZnSe), the semiconductor-electrocatalyst interfacial charge transfer rate constant was found to be the most significant parameter for stabilizing the photoelectrodes. Its increase induced a sigmoid-like increase in photostability, and its optimization made it possible to stabilize nine semiconductors. The semiconductor surface back-bond energy also increased the photostability in a sigmoid-like response, and its optimization allowed to stabilize five semiconductors. The increase of irradiance induced a logarithmic drop in photostability, and limiting it to 100 W/m2 could stabilize three semiconductors. We further observed that the photostability in a device of centimeter scale can vary by more than 50%, showing stable zones and photocorrosion hotspots. The photoelectrode's length as well as the electrocatalyst and electrolyte conductivities were found to be relevant parameters to impact this heterogeneity in the photostability. Thus, the photostability is not only defined by material properties but also by the specific combination of materials and by the device architecture. The model presented in this study can also be applied to photocathodes and other PEC designs, and can serve as a design tool for understanding, quantifying, and improving the stability.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000856496200001	36122305	
B	Zhang Xuan								Investigation of Fundamental Processes Governing Secondary Organic Aerosol Formation in Laboratory Chambers								Investigation of Fundamental Processes Governing Secondary Organic Aerosol Formation in Laboratory Chambers								304 pp	304 pp						2015	2015	Our understanding of the processes and mechanisms by which secondary organic aerosol (SOA) is formed is derived from laboratory chamber studies. In the atmosphere, SOA formation is primarily driven by progressive photooxidation of SOA precursors, coupled with their gas-particle partitioning. In the chamber environment, SOA-forming vapors undergo multiple chemical and physical processes that involve production and removal via gas-phase reactions; partitioning onto suspended particles vs. particles deposited on the chamber wall; and direct deposition on the chamber wall. The main focus of this dissertation is to characterize the interactions of organic vapors with suspended particles and the chamber wall and explore how these intertwined processes in laboratory chambers govern SOA formation and evolution. A Functional Group Oxidation Model (FGOM) that represents SOA formation and evolution in terms of the competition between functionalization and fragmentation, the extent of oxygen atom addition, and the change of volatility, is developed. The FGOM contains a set of parameters that are to be determined by fitting of the model to laboratory chamber data. The sensitivity of the model prediction to variation of the adjustable parameters allows one to assess the relative importance of various pathways involved in SOA formation. A critical aspect of the environmental chamber is the presence of the wall, which can induce deposition of SOA-forming vapors and promote heterogeneous reactions. An experimental protocol and model framework are first developed to constrain the vapor-wall interactions. By optimal fitting the model predictions to the observed wall-induced decay profiles of 25 oxidized organic compounds, the dominant parameter governing the extent of wall deposition of a compound is identified, i.e., wall accommodation coefficient. By correlating this parameter with the molecular properties of a compound via its volatility, the wall-induced deposition rate of an organic compound can be predicted based on its carbon and oxygen numbers in the molecule. Heterogeneous transformation of delta-hydroxycarbonyl, a major first-generation product from long-chain alkane photochemistry, is observed on the surface of particles and walls. The uniqueness of this reaction scheme is the production of substituted dihydrofuran, which is highly reactive towards ozone, OH, and NO3, thereby opening a reaction pathway that is not usually accessible to alkanes. A spectrum of highly-oxygenated products with carboxylic acid, ester, and ether functional groups is produced from the substituted dihydrofuran chemistry, thereby affecting the average oxidation state of the alkane-derived SOA. The vapor wall loss correction is applied to several chamber-derived SOA systems generated from both anthropogenic and biogenic sources. Experimental and modeling approaches are employed to constrain the partitioning behavior of SOA-forming vapors onto suspended particles vs. chamber walls. It is demonstrated that deposition of SOA-forming vapors to the chamber wall during photooxidation experiments can lead to substantial and systematic underestimation of SOA. Therefore, it is likely that a lack of proper accounting for vapor wall losses that suppress chamber-derived SOA yields contribute substantially to the underprediction of ambient SOA concentrations in atmospheric models.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0					978-13-217-9391-8	INSPEC:15985416

RCCR was purified from barley and a partial gene sequence was cloned (pHvRCCR). The gene was expressed at all stages of leaf development and in roots. By comparison with different databases, genomic sequences and expressed sequence tags similar to RCCR were found in phylogenetically diverse species, and activity of RCCR was demonstrated in two of them, Arabidopsis thaliana and Marchantia polymorpha. The gene of A. thaliana (AtRCCR) was employed for molecular cloning, heterologous expression and the production of polyclonal antibodies. With recombinant RCCR, the major product of RCC reduction was pFCC-1, but small quantities of its C1 epimer, pFCC-2, also accumulated. The reaction required reduced ferredoxin and was sensitive to oxygen. AtRCCR encoded a 35 kDa protein which was used for chloroplast import experiments. Upon transport, it was processed to a mature form of 31 kDa. The significance of cloning of RCCR is discussed in respect to the evolution of chlorophyll catabolism and to the cloning of PaO.									124	7	0	0	102	1	141			0960-7412			WOS:000085607300007	10743659

However, poor cycling stability, low round trip efficiency, and over charge potential during cycling are the major shortcomings for their future applications. In this work, a soluble redox mediator integrated into a polymer electrolyte provides immediate access to the solid discharged product, lowering the energy barrier for reversible Li2O2 generation and disintegration. Moreover, introducing a redox mediator to the polymer electrolyte boosts the ORR during discharge and the OER during the recharge process. The synergistic redox mediator pBQ (1,4 benzoquinone) dramatically reduces the over-potential. A small proportion of pBQ in the polymer electrolyte allows Li2O2 to develop in a thin film-like morphology on the cathode surface, resulting in a high reversible capacity of similar to 12 000 mA h g(-1) and an extended cycling stability of 100 cycles at 200 mA g(-1) with a cut-off capacity of 1000 mA h g(-1). The remarkable cell performance is attributed to the fast kinetics of para benzoquinone for the ORR and OER in Li-O-2 batteries. The use of a redox mediator in a polymer electrolyte opens a new avenue for practical Li-O-2 battery applications in achieving low charge potential and excellent energy efficiency.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1477-9226	1477-9234		WOS:000714389000001	34734595

However, most approaches for synthesizing porous electrodes from biomass require high energy consumption, which is resulted from the smash of biomass and the undergoing of serial assembly. Herein, a self-supported wood-derived ?breathable? membrane is utilized directly as electrodes for highefficient HER via an assembly of Fe-doped NiP alloys. The well-designed hierarchical porous structures in natural wood membrane (NWM) are unusually beneficial for electrolytes accessibility and hydrogen gas removal. The obtained wood-derived membrane exhibits a high electrocatalytic activity and good cycling durability in acidic and alkaline electrolytes. Remarkably, the Fe0.074NiP alloys/NWM electrode affords a large current density of 100 mA cm(-2) at extremely low overpotentials of 168 mV in acidic electrolyte and 174 mV in alkaline electrolyte. Density functional theory calculations unveil that the Fe atom doped in NiP alloys can create much more charge accumulation around Fe and Ni active sites, which helps decrease the Delta G(H)* and Delta G(H2O) and significantly promote the HER process. This new insight will promote further explorations of economic, high-efficient, and biodegradable wood-derived electrocatalysts for HER.

Herein, this study reports a novel Ni-Mn-O solid-solution cathode to widen the supercapacitor device voltage, which can potentially suppress the oxygen evolution reaction and thus be operated stably within a quite wide potential window of 0-1.4 V (vs saturated calomel electrode) after a simple but unique phase-transformation electrochemical activation. The solid-solution structure is designed with an ordered array architecture and in situ nanocarbon modification to promote the charge/mass transfer kinetics. By paring with commercial activated carbon anode, an ultrahigh voltage asymmetric supercapacitor in neutral aqueous LiCl electrolyte is assembled (2.4 V; among the highest for single-cell supercapacitors). Moreover, by using a polyvinyl alcohol (PVA)-LiCl electrolyte, a 2.4 V hydrogel supercapacitor is further developed with an excellent Coulombic efficiency, good rate capability, and remarkable cycle life (>5000 cycles; 95.5% capacity retention). Only one cell can power the light-emitting diode indicator brightly. The resulting maximum volumetric energy density is 4.72 mWh cm(-3), which is much superior to previous thin-film manganese-oxide-based supercapacitors and even battery-supercapacitor hybrid devices.									224	17	0	0	10	0	224			0935-9648	1521-4095		WOS:000411379000031	28783217

Both pure and Co:Ni3S2 composite nanostructures were grown on nickel foam under different synthesis temperatures. The synthesized nanostructures showed a wide variation of hierarchical morphology with variation of synthesis temperatures. The obtained nanostructures were investigated for electrochemical water splitting performance. The morphologies of the samples were found to acquire higher aspect ratio with increment in synthesis temperature. This morphological tuning led to remarkable enhancement in hydrogen evolution performance with very low overpotential 206 mV at 100 mA cm(-2) in acidic medium. Owing to this superior morphology tuned water splitting performance, this low dimensional Ni3S2 system can be recognized as potential leader in electrochemical energy harvesting sector.

In this work, we report a Fe-N co-doped cobalt selenide nanosheet array (Fe-N-CoSe2) on nickel foam (NF) as a highly efficient OER electrocatalyst via an anion and cation co-doping strategy using a metal-organic framework (MOF) as the precursor. The nanosheet arrays grown on NF without an additional binder are not only beneficial for accelerating the charge transfer, but also for suppressing electrocatalyst shedding. Furthermore, the nanosheet structure constructed using nanograins could promote electrolyte penetration and gas diffusion and increase the active sites. More importantly, the Fe and N element doping can further provide additional active sites, regulate the electronic structure and boost the OER kinetics. In view of the abovementioned points, the as-prepared Fe-N-CoSe2 electrocatalyst exhibits outstanding OER performance and long-term durability. It affords a current density of 50 mA cm(-2) at a small overpotential of 270 mV with a Tafel slope of 62.7 mV dec(-1), and the Fe-N-CoSe2 electrocatalyst has only a small attenuation of 1.9% after a 100 h constant test at 100 mA cm(-2) in alkaline solution, which is superior to the commercial RuO2 electrode. These results offer a potential approach for the preparation of effective and robust OER electrocatalysts as substitutes to replace the expensive commercial electrocatalysts based on element doping.									9	0	0	0	0	0	9			2052-1553			WOS:000639582500001

PCC 6803 wild type and the Ins2 mutant carrying an insertion in the drgA gene encoding soluble NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase (NQR) did not differ in the rate of light-induced oxygen evolution and Photosystem I reaction center (P700(+)) reduction after its oxidation with a white light pulse. In the presence of DCMU, the rate of P700(+) reduction was lower in mutant cells than in wild type cells. Depletion of respiratory substrates after 24 h dark-starvation caused more potent decrease in the rate of P700(+) reduction in DrgA mutant cells than in wild type cells. The reduction of P700(+) by electrons derived from exogenous glucose was slower in photoautotrophically grown DrgA mutant than in wild type cells. The mutation in the drgA gene did not impair the ability of Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 cells to oxidize glucose under heterotrophic conditions and did not impair the NDH-1-dependent, rotenone-inhibited electron transfer from NADPH to P700(+) in thylakoid membranes of the cyanobacterium. Under photoautotrophic growth conditions, NADPH-dehydrogenase activity in DrgA mutant cells was less than 30% from the level observed in wild type cells. The results suggest that NQR, encoded by the drgA gene, might participate in the regulation of cytoplasmic NADPH oxidation, supplying NADP(+) for glucose oxidation in the pentose phosphate cycle of cyanobacteria.									6	0	1	0	6	0	7			0006-2979			WOS:000221563600015	15170383

The energy gaps among these configurations obtained by vertical, adiabatic and adiabatic plus zero-point-energy (ZPE) correction procedures have been used for computation of the effective exchange integrals (J) in the spin Hamiltonian model. The J values are calculated by the ( 1) analytical method and the ( 2) generalized approximate spin projection (AP) method that eliminates the spin contamination errors of UB3LYP solutions. Using J values derived from these methods, exact diagonalization of the spin Hamiltonian matrix was carried out, yielding excitation energies and spin densities of the ground and lower-excited states of the cluster.

In the present work, we have synthesized MoS2 nanoparticles embedded over the graphene oxide (GO) and reduced graphene oxide (rGO) layer for superior catalytic activity in the hydrogen evolution process (HER). The nanocomposite materials are characterized using different spectroscopic and microscopic measurements. A Tafel slope of similar to 40 mV/decade suggested the Volmer-Heyrovsky mechanism for the HER process with MoS2/GO composite as the catalyst, which indicated that electrochemical desorption of hydrogen is the rate-limiting step. The small Tafel slope indicates a promising electrocatalyst for HER in practical application. MoS2/GO composite material has shown superior catalytic behavior compared to that of MoS2/rGO composite material. The HER catalytic activity of the catalysts is explored using scanning electrochemical microscopy (SECM) using the feedback and redox competition mode in SECM. The activation energy for HER activity was calculated, and the values are in the range of 17-6 kJ/mol.

The loss in the rate of O-2 evolution and CO2 assimilation (P (n)) are incommensurate with each other in both UV-A and UV-B exposed samples indicating the occurrence of loss in photostasis of photosynthesis by these two radiation bands. The alteration in redox status of Q (A) further suggests about a loss in redox homeostasis in the photosynthetic electron transport chain. However, both photochemical efficiency of PS II and P (n) are well maintained in UV-A + UV-B exposed cotyledons in spite of reduction in water-use efficiency. The acclimatization of clusterbean cotyledon to UV-B radiation in the presence of UV-A has been attributed to accumulation of flavonoids, increase in stomatal conductance (g (s)) and reduction in functional size of PS II.									7	0	0	0	7	0	7			0137-5881	1861-1664		WOS:000320561500028

In this respect, radiolysis is an important phenomenon which can significantly modify the local redox conditions. The Oklo natural fission zones are good examples where the effect of radiolysis can be deduced from a mineralogical and geochemical study. Zones 10 and 16 were studied because they are located at depth of 270 m in an area devoid of any recent water circulation and not subject to the effect of the lateritic alteration occurring elsewhere in this area.In zone 10, there is a marked evolution of the U-Pb-Fe-S mineralogy from the center to the periphery of the reactor zone. In the center, uraninite shows silicification and coffinitisation with the formation of galena and native lend; the PbO content of uraninite can be as much as 20 wt%. In the periphery of the reactor zone, some radiogenic lead is present as minium (Pb3O4) and in Pb-bearing calcite. In the surrounding sandstones, hematite is widespread.In zone 16, the mineral paragenesis is generally comparable with that of zone 10 but with some differences. Galena is the only Pb-bearing mineral associated with uraninite crystals. The PbO content of uraninite is always <7 wt%. In the periphery of the alteration zone, barite partly replaces quartz. In the reactor zone, hematite is sometimes replaced by pyrite.In an area where the fission zone 10 is in contact with sandstones devoid of organic matter, H2O-H2O2 and H2O-H-2 +/- CH4 inclusions were observed in healed microcracks in the detrital quartz grains. Based on microthermometric measurements, the salinity of the aqueous solution ranges from 0.2 to 18 wt% eq. NaCl. Raman analysis of the gas phase indicates that the hydrogen to oxygen ratio differs from an inclusion to the other.The presence of H-2- and O-2-bearing fluid inclusions confirms the existence of water radiolysis in the reactor zone. In zones rich in organic matter, oxygen was preferentially consumed in reactions with organic matter and its radiolytic products. In the absence of organic matter and its radiolytic products, oxidizing conditions prevailed and hematite and minium have formed. Consequently, presence of highly oxidizing conditions has important consequences on uranium and fission products mobility. Water radiolysis is also evidenced during the subsequent 1.97 By history of the reactor.During the fission reactions, redox conditions deduced from Pb-bearing minerals indicate that the sulfur fugacity was very low in zone 10 as shown by the formation of minium and higher in zone 16 with the formation of barite and pyrite. In this paper we discuss the geochemical consequences of such contrasting redox zones and the resulting redox heterogeneity created by water radiolysis.

Six metal-oxide-coated Ti electrodes (Ti/SnO2-Sb, Ti/SnO2-Sb/PbO2, Ti/SnO2-Sb/La-PbO2, Ti/SnO2-Sb/Ce-PbO2, Ti/SnO2-Sb/Ga-PbO2 and Ti/SnO2-Sb/Zr-PbO2) were prepared and characterized. Ti/SnO2-Sb/La-PbO2 showed the highest pseudo-first-order reaction rate constant (2.1 x 10(-2) min(-1)) and lowest energy consumption (21.35 Wh L-1) in the degradation of 1 mg L-1 TCEP at 10 mA cm(-2), mainly because of its highest oxygen evolution potential and (OH)-O-center dot production. Higher current density and neutral condition favored TCEP degradation, while the presence of Cl- or NO3- could suppress the degradation. In the electrochemical degradation of 10 mg L-1 TCEP, mineralization percentage of 48.0% (mineralization current efficiency of 0.30%) and PO43- release percentage of 72.7% were achieved at 150 min. By the attack of (OH)-O-center dot on the C-O and C-Cl bonds in TCEP molecular structure, products of chloroethanol, Cl and PO43- were released, with the major electrocatalytic degradation pathways of dechlorination and hydroxylation. Based on the results of flow cytometry, the relative toxicity to Escherichia coli effectively decreased to 4.93% in TCEP degradation. Compared with the UV-AOPs, electrochemical oxidation process is proved to be feasible and effective for mineralization and detoxification of TCEP in water.									7	1	0	0	2	0	7			1383-5866	1873-3794		WOS:000634729300004

In particular, protein oxidation occurs and may impair protein properties. These chemical reactions initiated during processing can develop during digestion. Indeed, the physicochemical conditions of the stomach (oxygen pressure, low pH) favor oxidation. In that respect, digestive proteases may be affected as well. Yet, very little is known about the link between endogenous oxidation of digestive enzymes, their potential denaturation, and, therefore, food protein digestibility. Thus, the objective of this study is to understand how oxidative chemical processes will impact the pepsin secondary structure and its hydrolytic activity. The folding and unfolding kinetics of pepsin under oxidative conditions was determined using Synchrotron Radiation Circular Dichroism. SRCD gave us the possibility to monitor the rapid kinetics of protein folding and unfolding in real-time, giving highly resolved spectral data. The proteolytic activity of control and oxidized pepsin was investigated by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry on a meat protein model, the creatine kinase. MALDI-TOF MS allowed a rapid evaluation of the proteolytic activity through peptide fingerprint. This study opens up new perspectives by shifting the digestion paradigm taking into account the gastric digestive enzyme and its substrate.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1				2304-8158		WOS:000653873100001	34063224

AbstractPorous structures offer highly accessible surfaces and rich pores, which facilitate the exposure of numerous active sites for photocatalytic reactions, leading to excellent performances. Recently, metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) have been considered ideal precursors for well-designed semiconductors with porous structures and/or heterostructures, which have shown enhanced photocatalytic activities. In this review, we summarize the recent development of porous structures, such as metal oxides and metal sulfides, and their heterostructures, derived from MOF-based materials as catalysts for various light-driven energy-/environment-related reactions, including water splitting, CO2 reduction, organic redox reaction, and pollution degradation.

Herein, on the basis of phase engineering theory, a novel conceptual design of energy band-gradient distribution is presented to consolidate the spatial transportation continuity of photocarriers, which is realized in the phase junction of CdS for the first time. Further being integrated with black phosphorus (BP) nanodots, the utilization of incident photons is extended to cover broad solar light-responsive window, and the p-n junctions with powerful internal electric fields resemble many accelerators distributed on the energy band-gradient pathway, thus furnishing sufficient internal dynamical transfer force for separation and migration of photocarriers with prolonged lifetime. The peculiar compound photocatalyst exhibits an excellent hydrogen evolution activity of 163.65 mu mol.h(-1).g(-1 ) and 5.72 mmol.h(-1).g(-1), as well as high apparent quantum yields (0.73 % and 25.7 % at 420 nm) under different conditions (with or without sacrificial agents). This study proposes a new exploitation strategy for the manipulation of energy band-gradient configuration in designing superior photocatalytic systems with available solar conversion efficiency.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000809964400001

Therefore, TiO2 has failed to reach the desired effect in terms of efficient photocatalytic hydrogen production. In this study, a range of titanium dioxide catalysts loaded with histidine (His) were prepared by an easy dipping method, viz. by treating TiO2 in His aqueous solutions with different concentrations at ambient temperature. Photocatalytic hydrogen evolution by splitting water was performed on His-modified TiO2 under 300-W Xe irradiation. His-loaded TiO2 catalysts exhibited improved photocatalytic performance compared with pristine TiO2; TiO2 treated in 1 x 10(-3) mol center dot L-1 His showed the highest photocatalytic H-2 evolution activity (4.77 mu mol g(-1) h(-1) gm(-2)), which was 3.77 times higher than that of pure TiO2. Infrared and XPS analysis showed that His was successfully combined to the TiO2 surface by hydrogen bonding, constructing a fast channel for interfacial charge transfer. In the photocatalytic process, the photogenerated holes could migrate from the valence band of TiO2 to the highest occupied molecular orbital of His, which reduced the recombination rate of photogenerated e(-)/h(+) pairs, consequently, improved H-2 production efficiency. Importantly, the composite catalyst exhibited no decline in photocatalytic activity over 30 h of operation. This research provides an alternative approach for creating high-efficiency photocatalysts for H-2 production.									2	1	0	0	0	0	2			2515-7655			WOS:000588560000001

In this high-entropy environment it is possible that most nucleons are in the form of free neutrons or bound into alpha particles. Thus, there can be many neutrons per seed nucleus even though the material is not particularly neutron rich. The predicted amount of r-process material ejected per event from this environment agrees well with that required by simple galactic evolution arguments. When averaged over regions of different neutron excess in the supernova ejecta, the calculated r-process abundance curve can give a good representation of the solar-system r-process abundances as long as the entropy per baryon is sufficiently high. Neutrino irradiation may aid in smoothing the final abundance distribution.									305	4	2	0	3	0	311			0004-637X	1538-4357		WOS:A1992JV80600028

The major drawback of these materials is their inactive basal plane as compared to their edge sites. Recently, Janus MoSSe-a novel sandwiched structure has been synthesized and predicted theoretically to obtain increased catalytic activity by applying strain, external electric field and by creating vacancy. In this work, we have used state-of-the-art density functional theory with dispersion correction (DFT-D3) to study the catalytic activity for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) of ZrS2, ZrSe2 and Janus ZrSSe. From our calculations, we conclude that among these three systems, the Janus ZrSSe (DG = 1:19 eV; Delta G : Gibbs free energy) is a good catalyst and can be utilized for HER at edge site. Janus ZrSSe shows enhanced catalytic activity at S-edge as compared to its basal plane and Se-edge site; whereas ZrSe2 shows good catalytic activity at Se-edge rather than at the basal plane. The ZrS2 shows good catalytic activity at S-edge. Further, we have doped Nb, Pt and W atoms in ZrS2, ZrSe2 and Janus ZrSSe to see their effect on catalytic activity of pristine compounds and found that the Nb-doped ZrSe2 shows good catalytic activity for HER and is best among all considered systems with DG = 0:63 eV followed by Pt-doped ZrS2. This study provides a theoretical basis for future application of ZrS2, ZrSe2 and Janus ZrSSe based catalysts for HER. (C) 2019 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Herein, ultrathin nickel terephthalate nanosheet 3D aggregates were synthesized by a facile one-pot hydrothermal method and employed as electrocatalysts for overall urea electrolysis. Surprisingly, the thickness of the nanosheets could be controlled by varying the synthesis time. A low-dose high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (TEM) technique with spherical aberration corrected TEM was utilized to visualize the crystalline structures of the ultrathin MOF nanosheets. Interestingly, similar to 5 nm thick disordered layers were observed at the edges of the ultrathin nanosheets, plausibly induced by vacancies that could not be identified with conventional TEM. The 3D aggregates of the ultrathin nanosheets with disordered layers required an ultralow potential of 1.381 V for urea oxidation with a current density of 10 mA cm(-2), which is 186 mV lower than that for the oxygen evolution reaction, and a potential of 1.52 V for overall urea electrolysis, with outstanding long-term durability. The amazing catalytic properties may be attributed to the adequate unsaturated coordination of nickel on the surface of the disordered layers, which guarantees numerous active sites; these results are consistent with the high-resolution TEM observations.									40	6	0	0	6	0	40			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000537152400008

Herein, we have investigated the effect of Mo doping on SnO2 buffer layer coated BiVO4 for PEC water splitting. SnO2 and Mo doped BiVO4 layers are coated with layer by layer deposition through a precursor solution based spin coating technique followed by annealing. At 5% doping of Mo, the sample (SBM5) shows a maximum current density of 1.65 mA cm(-2) at 1.64 V vs. RHEl in 0.1 M phosphate buffer solution under AM 1.5 G solar simulator, which is about 154% improvement over the sample without Mo (SBM0). The significant improvement in the photocurrent upon Mo doping is due to the improvement of various bulk and interfacial properties in the materials as measured by UV-vis spectroscopy, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), Mott-Schottky analysis, and open-circuit photovoltage (OCPV). The charge transfer kinetics at the BiVO4/electrolyte interface are investigated to simulate the oxygen evolution process in photoelectrochemical water oxidation in the feedback mode of scanning electrochemical microscopy (SECM) using 2 mM [Fe(CN)(6)](3-) as the redox couple. SECM investigation reveals a significant improvement in effective hole transfer rate constant from 2.18 cm s(-1) to 7.56 cm s(-1) for the hole transfer reaction from the valence band of BiVO4 to [Fe(CN)(6)](4-) to oxidize into [Fe(CN)(6)](3-) with the Mo doping in BiVO4. Results suggest that Mo6+ doping facilitates the hole transfer and suppresses the back reaction. The synergistic effect of fast forward and backward conversion of Mo6+ to Mo5+ expected to facilitate the V5+ to V4+ which has an important step to improve the photocurrent.									17	0	0	0	1	0	17				2046-2069		WOS:000510247900065	35540070

The new insights can be broadly applied to photocathodes, photoanodes, and overall water-splitting systems to control charge-carrier selectivity and improve performance.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2380-8195			WOS:000740446600001

However, improving the HER performance of electrocatalysts in alkaline media is still challenging. Herein, we report the development of a nickel hydroxide-cobalt disulfide nanowire array on a carbon cloth (Ni(OH)(2)-CoS2/CC) as a hybrid catalyst to significantly enhance the HER activity in alkaline solutions. Benefitting from heterogeneous interfaces in this 3D hybrid electrocatalyst, Ni(OH)(2)-CoS2/CC shows superior HER activity with only 99 mV overpotential to drive a current density of 20 mA cm(-2) in 1.0 M KOH, which is 100 mV less than that of CoS2/CC. Moreover, Ni(OH)(2)-CoS2/CC exhibits long-term electrochemical durability with the maintenance of its catalytic activity for 30 h. Density functional theory calculations are performed to gain further insight into the effect of Ni(OH)(2)-CoS2 interfaces, revealing that Ni(OH)(2) plays a key role in water dissociation to hydrogen intermediates and CoS2 facilitates the adsorption of hydrogen intermediates and H-2 generation. This work not only develops a promising electrocatalyst for the alkaline HER, but also paves a way to enhance the alkaline HER activity of CoS2 via the interface engineering strategy.									81	11	0	0	2	0	85			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000414960900013	29086782

Herein, free-standing mesoporous titanium nitride nanotube arrays (TiN NTAs) were fabricated to serve as a substrate for Pt loadings in trace amounts. TiN NTAs were prepared by thermal treatment of anodic TiO2NTAs at 750 degrees C for 3 h in a NH(3)atmosphere. The uniform TiN NTAs showed an inner diameter of similar to 80 nm and a length of similar to 7 mu m, with many mesoporous holes ranging from 5 to 10 nm in diameter on the nanotube walls. Pt species dissolved from the Pt counter electrode in electrochemical cycling were redeposited on the mesoporous TiN NTAs to produce Pt-TiN NTAs with an ultra-low Pt loading of 8.3 mu g cm(-2). Pt-TiN NTAs exhibited 15-fold higher mass activity towards HER than the benchmark 20 wt% Pt/C in acidic media, with an overpotential of 71 mVvs. RHE at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2), a Tafel slope value of 46.4 mV dec(-1)and excellent stability. The performance of Pt-TiN NTAs is also much better than that of Pt species deposited on non-mesoporous nanotube arrays due to the shortcuts originating from the mesoporous holes on the nanotube walls for electron and mass transfer.									18	1	0	0	1	0	19			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000552498200038	32656553

Investigation of the gas evolution from high-Tc superconductivity ceramic Y-Ba-Cu-O heat treated in vacuum								Superconductivity: Physics, Chemistry, Technology				3	6			1057	64						June 1990	1990	The gas evolution in vacuum of the HTSC ceramic with the original composition YBa2Cu3O6.9+or-0.1, obtained by the method of self-propagating high-temperature synthesis (SHS) is investigated by means of a programmable thermal desorption method in combination with a mass-spectral analysis in the temperature interval 423-1173 K. An evolution of H2O, CO and CO2, in addition to oxygen was found to occur during the thermal desorption of HTSC samples. In the temperature interval 623-723 K the measured value of the desorption enthalpy of O2 was 29.6+or-2.4 kcal/mole. The desorption enthalpies of H2O, CO, and CO2 were determined. Two types of mechanisms were found for the desorption of CO2 molecules from HTSC. A comparison of the results obtained by the thermal-desorption method and spark mass spectrometry showed that nearly all of the impurity carbon is removed from the HTSC samples as a result of a vacuum annealing at temperatures of 773-873 K. The maximum relative content of carbon is on the order of 3times10-2 g.at C/mole HTSC. It was assumed that in the test samples the carbon is segregated primarily at the surface in the form of sorbed CO and CO2 molecules, which occupy essentially the entire surface. The adsorption of a large amount of CO2 at the surface of the HTSC samples degrades the electrical properties of these samples.									0	0	0		0	0	0			0235-8964			INSPEC:3784650

Velocity-aligned, reagent O(1D) atoms were generated under bulb conditions via polarized laser photodissociation of N2O. Analysis of the Doppler profiles of nascent OH(nu,N) fragments has allowed both scalar and vectorial product correlations to be determined, including differential scattering cross sections and rotational alignments. These imply the operation of a 'delayed' collision mechanism, dominated by the deeply attractive potential energy surface associated with the insertion to form CH3OH; the intermediacy of a long-lived complex is excluded, however. Rotational angular momentum in the recoiling OH fragments is preferentially aligned perpendicular to, and azimuthally distributed about, their recoil velocity. The rotational excitation is thereby attributed to bending motion in the C...O...H plane during the reagent collisions. The scalar product pair correlations establish a near-zero translational exoergicity and anticorrelated internal energy distributions in the two reaction products.									32	0	0	0	0	0	32			0021-2148			WOS:A1994NV75800010

Electrical and optical phenomena accompanying the discharges were investigated along with feeding gases, flow rates and point-to-plane electrode gap distance. The experiments were primarily focused on the optical emission of the near UV range, providing a sufficient energy threshold for water dissociation and excitation. The OH(Delta(2) Sigma(+)-> X-2, Pi, Delta nu = 0) band optical emission intensity indicated the presence of plasma chemical reactions involving hydrogen formation. Despite the fact that energy input was high, the OH( A - X) optical emission was found to be negligible at the zero gap distance between the tip of the metal rod and water surface. In the gas atmosphere saturated with water vapour the OH( A - X) intensity was relatively high compared with the liquid and transient phases although the optical emission strongly depended on the flow rate and type of feeding gas. The gas phase was found to be more favourable because of less energy consumption in the cases of He and Ar carrier gases, and quenching mechanisms of oxygen in the N-2 carrier gas atmosphere, preventing hydrogen from recombining with oxygen. In the gas phase the discharge was at a steady state, in contrast to the other phases, in which bubbles interrupted propagation of the plasma channel. Optical emission intensity of OH(A-X) band increased according to the flow rate or residence time of the He feeding gas. Nevertheless, a reciprocal tendency was acquired for N-2 and Ar carrier gases. The peak value of OH(A-X) band optical emission intensity was observed near the water surface; however in the cases of Ar and N-2 with a 0.5 SLM flow rate, it was shifted below the water surface. Rotational temperature was estimated to be in the range of 900 - 3600 K, according to the carrier gas and flow rate, which is sufficient for hydrogen production.									42	4	0	0	6	1	43			0022-3727	1361-6463		WOS:000239991000016

However,due to the degrading degree of zinc minerals,fluoride and chloride concentration in electrolyte for zinc electrowinning ascends gradually,which further leads to severer corrosion of lead-based anode and lower quality of cathodic zinc. Consequently,the traditional leadbased anode could not meet the demand of industrial operation,which threatens the sustainable development of zinc metallurgy industry. Therefore, it is urgent to improve the stability of lead-based anode in sulfuric acid solutions. Currently,the main measures taken to improve the service stability of lead-based anode are as follows: (i) optimizing metallic microstructure of lead alloys through adjusting alloy elements,heat treatment,plastic deformation; (ii) surface pretreatment such as sandblasting and chemical etching; (iii) designing novel electrode structures,such as porous anode,sandwich structure anode and DSA anode. These measures were mainly aimed at lead or lead alloy anodes. However,lead-based anodes work as metal/oxides electrodes during electrowinning process due to the anodic layer formed on the surface of lead substrates. Therefore,these measures mentioned above fails to resolve the stability problem of lead-based anodes. As a metal/oxides electrode,the key for improving the stability of lead-based anode in sulfuric acid solution was simultaneously improving the bond stability of substrate/anodic layer and inner stability of anodic layer. In this review,the inf-luence of corrosion resistance,mechanical performance, and surface pretreatment of lead-based substrate on the bond stability of substrate/anodic layer was summarized. In addition,the influence of oxygen evolution reaction,composition and structure of anodic layer on the inner stability of anodic layer was analyzed. Furthermore, the influence mechanism of these factors on the stability of lead-based anode was discussed. Designing novel lead-based anode should focus on simultaneously improving the bond stability of substrate/anodic layer and inner stability of anodic layer. The crucial work for preparing novel lead-based anodes is designing transition layer with high bond-strength,low chemical potential difference,and stable dimension between substrate and anodic layer,and synthesizing anodic layer with uniform composition and compact structure. Based on analysis mentioned above,it could be forecasted that future developments of lead-based anode used in sulfuric acid solutions as follows: (i) designing 3D porous Pb or Pb alloy substrate to improve the bond-stability of substrate and anodic layer; (ii) constructing transition layer consisting of gradient oxides between substrate and anodic layer,such asPb-PbO-PbO_x-PbO_2. The gradient O concentration would help inhibiting the transfer of O species formed during oxygen evolution reaction towards the substrate,which further relieves oxidation and corrosion of lead (or lead alloy) substrate; (iii) realizing metallurgical bond of oxide particles and lead substrates to improve the service stability of anodic layer.			铅基阳极具有制备简单、价格低廉的优势而被广泛应用于有色金属湿法电沉积领域。随着矿物品位降低,锌电解液中氟、氯浓度逐步增大,导致铅基阳极腐蚀加剧、电锌品质降级。传统铅基阳极无法满足工业应用要求,直接限制了锌冶炼行业的可持续发展,铅基阳极在硫酸体系中的稳定性亟待提升。当前,国内外研究者为提升铅基阳极服役稳定性所采取的主要措施有: (1)调控铅合金的金相结构,如优化合金成分、热处理和塑性加工; (2)铅阳极板表面预处理,如喷砂处理、溶液预处理等; (3)优化铅阳极结构,如多孔阳极、夹层阳极和涂层电极等。上述措施大部分以铅或铅合金电极为改进对象,然而,电解过程中铅合金阳极表面覆盖有氧化物膜层,本质上是以金属/氧化物电极形式服役的。因此,上述改进措施仍然无法从根本上解决铅基阳极稳定性差的难题。作为金属/氧化物电极,改善铅基阳极在硫酸体系中稳定性的关键在于同步提升铅基阳极的基底/氧化膜层结合稳定性和氧化膜层内部稳定性。本文归纳了基底的耐腐蚀性能、力学性能、表面预处理三个因素对基底与氧化膜层结合稳定性的影响,以及析氧反应、膜层成分、膜层结构三个因素对氧化膜层内部稳定性的影响,并探讨了这些因素对铅基阳极稳定性的影响机制。开发新型铅基阳极应着眼于同步提升基底/氧化膜层结合稳定性和氧化膜层内部稳定性。设计高结合强度、低化学势差、结合形态稳定的金属/氧化物过渡层,预制成分分布均匀、结构致密的氧化膜层,是制备满足高氟、氯电解体系工业应用要求的新型铅基阳极的关键。基于上述分析,可以预测硫酸体系析氧铅基阳极未来可能的发展方向有: (1)设计三维有序多孔Pb或Pb合金基底,提高基底与氧化膜层的结合强度; (2)构筑梯度氧化物过渡层,即在基底与氧化膜层间构筑Pb-PbO-PbO_x-PbO_2过渡层,形成O浓度梯度,抑制析氧反应产生的活性氧向基底扩散; (3)实现氧化物颗粒与基底冶金结合,提高氧化物涂层的服役稳定性。						1	1	0	0	0	0	1			1005-023X			CSCD:6574960

Peroxidases (PRXs) are involved in various abiotic stress responses. Furthermore, only few wheat PRXs have been characterized in the mechanism of the abiotic stress response. Results In this study, a novel wheat peroxidase (PRX) gene namedTaPRX-2A,a member of wheat class III PRX gene family, was cloned and its response to salt stress was characterized. Based on the identification and evolutionary analysis of class III PRXs in 12 plants, we proposed an evolutionary model forTaPRX-2A, suggesting that occurrence of some exon fusion events during evolution. We also detected the positive selection of PRX domain in 13 PRXs involving our evolutionary model, and found 2 or 6 positively selected sites duringTaPRX-2Aevolution. Quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) results showed thatTaPRX-2Aexhibited relatively higher expression levels in root tissue than those exhibited in leaf and stem tissues.TaPRX-2Aexpression was also induced by abiotic stresses and hormone treatments such as polyethylene glycol 6000, NaCl, hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), salicylic acid (SA), methyljasmonic acid (MeJA) and abscisic acid (ABA). Transgenic wheat plants with overexpression ofTaPRX-2Ashowed higher tolerance to salt stress than wild-type (WT) plants. Confocal microscopy revealed thatTaPRX-2A-eGFP was mainly localized in cell nuclei. Survival rate, relative water content, and shoot length were higher inTaPRX-2A-overexpressing wheat than in the WT wheat, whereas root length was not significantly different. The activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD), peroxidase (POD), and catalase (CAT) were enhanced inTaPRX-2A-overexpressing wheat compared with those in the WT wheat, resulting in the reduction of reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation and malondialdehyde (MDA) content. The expression levels of downstream stress-related genes showed thatRD22,TLP4,ABAI,GST22,FeSOD, andCATexhibited higher expressions inTaPRX-2A-overexpressing wheat than in WT under salt stress. Conclusions The results show thatTaPRX-2Aplays a positive role in the response to salt stress by scavenging ROS and regulating stress-related genes.									20	0	0	0	14	0	20			1471-2229			WOS:000566919600001	32847515

These complexes have been characterized in solution by 1D and 2D NMR spectroscopy, UV-vis and electrochemical techniques and in the solid state by X-ray diffraction analysis. The reaction of 1(PF6) with Ag+ generates the corresponding solvated complex where the Cl ligand has been removed as insoluble AgCl, followed by the oxidation of Ru(II) to Ru(III) to generate the corresponding dinuclear complex trans-Ru-III-OH, 2(PF6)(3). The latter has been shown to catalytically oxidize water to molecular dioxygen using Ce(IV) as oxidant. Quantitative gas evolution as a function of time has been monitored on line by both manometry and mass spectroscopy (MS) techniques. Relative initial velocities of oxygen formation together with structural considerations rule out an intramolecular O-O bond formation pathway.									37	0	0	0	3	0	37			1477-9226	1477-9234		WOS:000288677900026	21384040

This paper considers the vanadium redox flow battery (VRB) based energy storage system as it has very long cycle life, deep discharge capability, high energy efficiency and no cell-balancing issues. In case of the islanded microgrid, the charging process of VRB based energy storage system is vastly affected by variable power from RES. The conventional charging schemes may fail to charge, be affected by greater current tracking error and may create gassing side reactions (oxygen and hydrogen evolutions) which significantly degrades the health and the performance of VRB. To alleviate these limitations, this paper presents an advanced charging control scheme for VRB based energy storage system to deal with the variable input power. The proposed control approach is based on the first principle model of VRB which calculates the charging current based on the available power from RES. Moreover, the proposed control scheme accurately determines the limiting current based on the charging current and surface concentration boundary of the vanadium ions and electrolyte flow rate. This limiting current determination is the key contribution of this paper which works as a control constraint and protects the VRB from overcharging and gassing side reactions. The proposed charging scheme is applied through a PI-controller based single phase shifted (SPS) isolated dualactive-bridge (DAB) dc-dc converter.					27th IEEE International Symposium on Industrial Electronics (ISIE)27th IEEE International Symposium on Industrial Electronics (ISIE)	JUN 13-15, 2018JUN 13-15, 2018	Inst Elect & Elect Engineers; IEEE Ind Elect SocInst Elect & Elect Engineers; IEEE Ind Elect Soc	Cairns, AUSTRALIACairns, AUSTRALIA	3	0	0	0	0	0	3			2163-5137		978-1-5386-3705-0	WOS:000719417200076

LAMIS is a powerful tool for tracking the origination of atoms that is involved in formation of investigated molecules by labeling atoms with their isotopic substitution. The evolutionary formation pathways of organic molecules, especially of C-2 dimers and CN radicals, were frequently reported. However, very little is known about the formation pathways for metallic radicals and heterodimers in laser ablated plasma. This research focuses on elucidating the formation pathways of AlO radicals in femtosecond laser ablated plasma from O-18-labeled Al2O3 pellet. Plasmas expanding with strong forward bias in the direction normal to the sample surface were generated in the wake of a weakly ionized channel created by a femtosecond laser. The formation mechanism of AlO and influence of air were investigated with multiple plasma diagnostic methods such as monochromatic fast gating imaging, spatiotemporal resolved optical emission spectroscopy, and LAMIS. An advanced LAMIS fitting procedure was used to deduce the spatiotemporal distributions of (AlO)-O-18 and (AlO)-O-16 number densities and also their ratios. We found that the (AlO)-O-16/(AlO)-O-18 number density ratio is higher for plasma portion closer to the sample surface, which suggests that chemical reactions between the plasma plume and ambient air are more intense at the tail of the plasma. The results also reveals that direct association of free Al and O atoms is the main mechanism for the formation of AlO at the early stage of the plasma. To the contrast, chemical reactions between plasma materials and ambient oxygen molecules and the isotope exchange effect are the dominant mechanisms of the formation of AlO and evolution of (AlO)-O-16/(AlO)-O-18 number density ratio at the late stage of the plasma.									24	4	0	0	6	0	24			0003-2700	1520-6882		WOS:000406085300061	28640577

Therefore, the electrocatalytic material of an anode is of importance to achieve a highly efficient water splitting reaction. Among the various requirements, the surface area of electrocatalysts has been considered a key factor in electrocatalytic reactions. In this study, to obtain a high surface area RuO2 electrocatalyst, a supercritical hydrothermal synthetic method was applied. Indeed, RuO2 particles with the surface area of 78.2 m(2)/g were successfully synthesized, which is 7 times higher compared with the commercial version. We also investigated the electrocatalytic activity of the synthesized high surface area RuO2 by evaluating the number of active sites and hydrogen production rates and compared them with the commercial one as a reference. Based on the cyclic voltammetric measurements, the number of active sites was estimated to be 152.1 mC cm(-2) and 17.0 mC cm(-2) for the synthetic and the commercial RuO2, respectively. More importantly, the hydrogen production rates measured by the water splitting device with RuO2 films for the anode showed 4 times higher value for the synthetic RuO2 compared with the commercial one.

In electrochemical energy storage, multimetal oxide cathode materials can generally provide a wider electrochemical stability window and a higher capacity compared with single metal oxides cathode. Here, a new type of cathode material, MnFe2Co3O8 nanodots/functional graphene sheets, is designed and used for aqueous hybrid Zn-based energy storage. Coupling with a hybrid electrolyte based on zinc sulfate and potassium hydroxide, the asfabricated battery was able to work with a wide electrochemical window of 0.1 similar to 1.8 V, showed a high specific capacity of 660 mAh/g, delivered an ultrahigh energy density of 1135 Wh/kg and a scalable power density of 5754 W/kg (calculated based on the cathode), and displayed a long cycling life of 1000 cycles. These are mainly attributed to the valence charge density distribution in MnFe2Co3O8 nanodots, the good structural strengthening as well as high conductivity of the cathode, and the right electrolyte. Such cathode material also exhibited high electrocatalytic activity for oxygen evolution reaction and thus could be used for constructing a Zn-air battery with an ultrahigh reversible capacity of 9556 mAh/g.

Variable energy, synchrotron radiation (SR), permits access to information not available to common lab-based radiation sources, making high-energy PES studies extremely useful for understanding thin films and interfaces. I ligh-SR photon flux has been useful for developing models of soft X-ray-induced effects, but hard X-ray SR-induced effects are less well studied and will be increasingly important as popularity and availability of SR for thin film analysis continues to grow. We report here on observed modification of the solid electrolyte interphase of a lithium-ion battery electrode during prolonged exposure to 4 key SR.

Nonetheless, and particularly in the case of powder materials, a commonly accepted method to determine the actual density of active sites is not yet available, mainly because a method to quantify the amount of material under investigation is missing. In this study, we propose the use of the cavity microelectrode (C-ME, i.e., a cylindrical recessed microdisk) of known volume, which enables the study of a known amount of material, thus allowing the quantitative evaluation of its properties. The validation of the method implied (i) the preparation of C-MEs with different radii and depths; (ii) the calibration of the relevant volumes by means of a "standard" powder, whose number of active sites can be easily determined by cyclic voltammetry; and (iii) their use for the quantification of specific parameters that identify the electrochemical properties of mixed IrO2-SnO2 powders. The results evidence that the quantity of charge relative to the number of pseudocapacitance sites and the currents for the oxygen evolution reaction are proportional to the cavity volumes. This strategy allows the direct comparison of different materials for their rapid and accurate screening. In addition, thanks to the small amount of material required for the sample (typically 10-100 ng), the method can be safely listed among the nondestructive techniques.									27	0	0	0	3	0	27			0003-2700	1520-6882		WOS:000288887700059	21370825

In the accelerated life test, the service life of Gd-doped PbO2 electrodes are more stable and durable. Scanning electron microscope and x-ray diffraction tests reveal that Gd-doped PbO2 electrodes have more compact structure and finer grain size. Electrochemical measurements and fluorescence experiments show that Gd-doped PbO2 electrodes have higher oxygen evolution overpotential, a larger electrochemically active surface area, and stronger ability to generate hydroxyl radicals. The electrocatalytic performance of the Gd-doped PbO2 electrode for the electrochemical degradation of thiamethoxam was studied. The degradation process accorded with pseudo-first-order kinetics, with higher thiamethoxam and total organic carbon removal capabilities, as well as higher mineralization current efficiency and lower energy consumption. In the degradation process, it has favourable reusability. The experimental results demonstrate that Gd-doped PbO2 electrodes have an excellent treatment effect and a wider application prospect in the field of pollutant degradation.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0008-4034	1939-019X		WOS:000631659400001

Herein, a series of foam-like composites comprised of small RhPx nanoparticles (NPs) and N, P co-doped carbon (NPC) framework are first reported as novel high-efficiency NRR electrocatalysts. Interestingly, the electronic structure and catalytic behavior of RhPx are modified by altering the contents of P in composites. Density function theory (DFT) calculations prove that the introduction of P into the rhodium lattice can dramatically reduce the catalytic reaction barrier and facilitate the intermediate process of catalytic reaction. Compared with most of the reported materials, this new catalyst possesses high ammonia (NH3) yield rate of 37.6 mu g h(-1) mg(cat).(-1) and Faraday efficiency (FE) of 7.64 %, as well as good selectivity and superior stability in acid conditions. This work provides a theoretical basis and practical scheme for the wide application of other robust transition metal phosphides electrocatalysts in NRR.									51	4	0	0	3	0	53			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000514218900038

The combination of p-type Cu2O with n-type TiO2 results in a p-n heterojunction highly beneficial to photocatalytic processes, due to the resulting capability of (i) absorbing visible light irradiation and (ii) promoting charge carrier separation.An intense scientific activity has been recorded in the field of H-2 generation through water photosplitting and organic photoreforming over Cu2O/TiO2-based composites.This literature survey aims at clarifying conflicting information on the preparation, characterization, and use of Cu2O/TiO2 composites for H-2 evolution. Detailed information on analytical techniques devoted to uniquely identifying Cu2O has been provided. Preparation method, effect of pH, effect of sacrificial agent, chemical stability of Cu2O/TiO2 composites, and reaction mechanisms have been critically discussed.

J	GEST, H								HISTORY OF CONCEPTS OF THE COMPARATIVE BIOCHEMISTRY OF OXYGENIC AND ANOXYGENIC PHOTOSYNTHESES								PHOTOSYNTHESIS RESEARCH				35	1			87	96		10.1007/BF02185414				JAN 1993	1993	Experiments of Hans Molisch in 1907 demonstrated that purple bacteria do not evolve molecular oxygen during photosynthetic metabolism, and can use organic compounds as sources of cell carbon for anaerobic 'photoheterotrophic' growth. Molisch's conclusion that he discovered a new photosynthetic growth mode was not accepted for some 30 years because of the prevailing definition of photosynthesis as light-dependent conversion of carbon dioxide and inorganic reductants to cell materials. Meanwhile, during the decade of the 1930s, Cornelis van Niel formulated the 'comparative biochemical water-cleavage hypothesis' of photosynthesis, which enjoyed great popularity for about 20 years. According to this concept, photolysis of water yielded 'H' and 'OH', the former acting as the hydrogen donor for CO2 reduction in all modes of photosynthesis. Oxygenic organisms were presumed to contain a unique biochemical system capable of converting 'OH' to water and O2. To explain the absence of O2 formation by purple and green photosynthetic bacteria, it was supposed that such organisms lacked the oxygen-forming system and, instead, 'OH' was disposed of by reduction with an inorganic H(e) donor (other than water) according to the general equation: 2 'OH' + H2A --> 2 H2O + A, where H2A is H-2 or an inorganic sulfur compound.Critical tests of van Niel's hypothesis could not be devised, and his proposal was abandoned soon after the discovery of in vitro photophosphorylation by green plant chloroplasts and membranes of purple bacteria in 1954. Photophosphorylation was then viewed as one key common denominator of oxygenic and anoxygenic photosyntheses. From later research it became clear that light-dependent phosphorylation of adenosine diphosphate was a consequence of photochemical charge separation and electron flow in reaction centers embedded in membranes of all photosynthetic organisms. The similarities, as well as the differences, in fine structure and function of reaction centers in anoxygenic and oxygenic organisms are now believed to reflect the course of evolution of oxygenic organisms from anoxygenic photosynthetic precursors. Thus, with the acquisition of new knowledge, concepts of the comparative biochemistry of photosynthetic processes have been radically altered during the past several decades. This paper describes-highpoints of the history of these changes.									10	0	0	0	7	0	9			0166-8595			WOS:A1993KJ28800009	24318623

Titanium dioxide (TiO2) is one of the most studied metal oxides in this field as a photoanode. Achieving its full potential requires controlling its morphology and crystallinity and especially the exposure of its most active crystal facets. Herein, we present the formation of nanostructured TiO2 photoanodes with anatase phase and high exposure of the {0 1 0} facet, the most active TiO2 phase and facet. TiO2 photoanodes were prepared from a Ti7O4(OEt)(20) titanium oxo/alkoxy cluster solution using aerosol assisted chemical vapor deposition. Characterization techniques such as SEM and TEM reveal that these TiO2 photoanodes consist of morphologies resembling the crystals of gypsum, sand and water found in nature, also known as desert roses. Furthermore, TEM and XRD analysis also reveals that the metastable anatase TiO2 phase is maintained up to 1000 degrees C and exceeds the typical anatase-to-rutile phase-transition temperature of 500-750 degrees C, a feature that could be exploited in the smart ceramics industry. Photoelectrochemical measurements show that these desert-rose TiO2 photoanodes achieve excellent photocurrent densities with an incident photon-to-current efficiency of similar to 100% at 350 nm and a faradaic efficiency for oxygen evolution of similar to 90%.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000481578000043

Introducing water vapour during the pyrolysis of NH2-MIL-125(Ti) not only functionalizes the derived porous carbon matrix with carboxyl groups but also forms additional oxygen-rich N like interstitial/intraband states lying above the valence band of TiO2 along with the self-doped carbon, which further narrows the energy band gaps of polymorphic TiO2 nanoparticles that enhance photocatalytic charge transfer efficiency. Without co-catalyst, sample N-C-TiO2/C-ArW demonstrates H-2 evolution activity of 426 mu mol g(cat)(-1) h(-1), which remarkably outperforms commercial TiO2 (P-25) and N-C-TiO2/C-Ar with a 5-fold and 3-fold H-2 generation, respectively. This study clearly shows that water vapour atmosphere during the pyrolysis increases the hydrophilicity of the Ti-MOF derived composites by functionalizing porous carbon matrix with carboxylic groups, as well as enhancing the electrical conductivity and charge transfer efficiency due to the formation of additional localized oxygen-rich N like interstitial/intraband states. This work also demonstrates that by optimizing the anatase-rutile phase composition of the TiO2 polymorphs, tuning the energy band gaps by N/C co-doping and functionalizing the porous carbon matrix in the N-C-TiO2/C nanocomposites, the photocatalytic H-2 generation activity can be further enhanced.

In this study, we carry out density functional theory calculations to reveal the origin and formation process of OH& x2d9; radicals by investigating the interaction of water with DMPO on a rutile TiO2(110) surface.

However, it is rarely reported due to its harsh synthesis conditions. Herein, pure metallic Ni3C nanoparticles in situ embedded in two-dimensional (2D) nitrogen-doped carbon nanoflakes (Ni3C/NC nanoflakes) are successfully prepared through one-step pyrolyzing Ni-urea complex at a relatively mild temperature at 350 degrees C. The composition and nanostructure of the catalyst can be easily controlled by adjusting the synthetic conditions, such as pyrolysis temperature and reactant concentration. The NC nanoflakes with a large specific surface area and massive mesopores present a 2D morphology, which is beneficial to disperse Ni3C nanoparticles to maintain their high conductivity. Based on advantage of nanostructure, Ni3C/NC nanoflakes exhibit high electrocatalytic performance with a low overpotential of 309 mV, small Tafel slope of 72 mV dec(-1), as well as good stability. Furthermore, this study could provide a new strategy for the design and fabrication of other transition-metal carbides. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

We use density functional theory (DFT) to predict the 2D WSeTe/XS2 (X = Hf, Sn, Zr) van der Waals (vdW) heterojunctions as the potential direct Z-scheme heterojunction photocatalysts and discuss the mechanism of photocatalytic water splitting under the interaction of vertical intrinsic electric field and built-in electric field. The WSeTe/XS2 heterojunctions have large band-edge staggered alignment, small interlayer bandgap, and good interlayer carrier recombination, which predict the direct Z-scheme charge transfer path formation. Meanwhile, the small bandgap of the 2D WSeTe/XS2 direct Z-scheme heterojunctions enables it to obtain a wide light absorption range. The built-in electric field from WSeTe to XS2 changes the charge transfer mode of the heterojunction and improves the separation efficiency of photo-generated carriers, and the vertical intrinsic electric field not only improves the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) ability but also reduces the bandgap limitation of photocatalytic materials. In this paper, the 2D WSeTe/XS2 heterojunctions show significant advantages as photocatalytic materials, providing unique insights for researching and developing this kind of heterojunction.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000838340300004

However, its low electrical conductivity and the electrochemically inert basal plane of MoS2 decrease the HER performance. Herein, we used graphene and carbon cloth (CC) to boost the electrocatalytic activity of MoS2. Using nickel electrodeposition and chemical vapor deposition (CVD) at high temperature, graphene was grown on carbon cloth (Gr/CC) and a sea-grape-like morphology was formed simultaneously. Finally, Gr/CC was covered up with MoS2 using two-zone CVD (MoS2/Gr/CC), resulting in a three-dimensional (3D) sea-grape-like heterostructure. The MoS2/Gr/CC exhibits outstanding HER performance, with a suitable onset potential (50 mV), low.10 (91 mV, overpotential at 10 mA cm(-2)), high electrical double layer capacitance (C-dl; 239 mF cm(-2)), low Tafel slope value (48 mV dec(-1)), and high stability in 0.5 M H2SO4 for two days at various overpotentials. The 3D seagrape-like morphology and the synergistic effect of MoS2 and graphene led to the enhanced electrocatalytic activity of MoS2/Gr/CC, indicating much better HER performance than most electrocatalysts based on graphene and MoS2.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000564113100011

The flame retardancy and thermal and mechanical properties of the UPR samples were investigated by limiting oxygen index (LOI) measurements, cone calorimetry, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), a thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), and a tension test. The results showed that the introduction of BADPS remarkably enhanced the flame resistance and high-temperature stability, as well as the tensile performance of UPR. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Fourier transform infrared (FTIR), and Raman spectroscopy studies revealed that BADPS can efficaciously promote the formation of UPR char residue with an improved microstructure and increased graphitization degree, which enhancedthe high-temperature stability and char yield of UPR. Additionally, a thermogravimetry-Fourier transform infrared (TG-FTIR) analysis corroborated that the evolution of combustible volatiles from UPR decomposition was substantially restrained by the incorporation of BADPS, which is beneficial for the suppression of fire hazards in UPR.									11	0	0	0	0	0	11				2073-4360		WOS:000557967300001	32605118

In this work, for the first time the CO-induced dynamic structure of Pd@Au core-shell NPs with different size and shape has been studied systemically using ab initio molecular dynamics. Our calculation has demonstrated that the thermostability of Pd@Au bimetallic NPs is decreased with increasing CO coverage. However, the kinetic stability can be enhanced when CO coverage is very high. With the adsorption of CO, the interaction between surface unoccupied atoms and nearby metal atoms at the second layer is strengthened, while the stress distribution in the second layer is significantly changed. The surface unoccupied metal atoms then migrate into the second layer, and metal atoms in the second layer move to surface in return. Such atomic diffusion between the top two layers leads to the atomic exchange in NPs interior layer by layer. Finally, Pd and Au atoms are redistributed in NPs, and Pd atoms accumulate at surface because of stronger CO adsorption. In a word, the segregation is dominated by the inward diffusion of surface unoccupied metal atoms. The great challenge in this work is how to establish the relationship between gas atmosphere and NP kinetic stability for determining the dynamic 3D bimetallic NPs.									12	0	0	0	1	0	12			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000471105000111

We investigated the effect of water temperature on plant morphology, biomass accumulation and oxygen-exchange for five clones of the submerged aquatic macrophyte Potamogeton pectinatus L., originating from 42 to 68degreesN.2 We tested whether P pectinatus clones show local adaptation to the prevailing environmental temperatures (in which case high-latitude clones would perform better at lower temperatures and vice versa). Alternatively, pronounced phenotypic plasticity in the response to temperature could enable individual clones to perform well over a wide range of environmental temperatures (i.e. high degree of thermal tolerance).3 The overall pattern of thermal response was similar for all clones. In addition, we detected acclimative phenotypic plasticity in both physiological and morphological plant parameters. The optimum temperatures for gross or for net photosynthesis did not vary with growth temperature, but morphological acclimation partly compensated for the loss of photosynthetic capacity at higher temperatures, enabling comparable rates of ambient gross photosynthesis. Respiratory reactions also showed some degree of thermal acclimation to higher temperatures.4 As a result of the combined effects of changes in morphology and physiology, all clones produced similar amounts of plant biomass over a relatively wide range of water temperatures. We therefore conclude that P pectinatus is thermally tolerant and not locally adapted.									22	1	0	0	22	1	24			0022-0477	1365-2745		WOS:000174154500014

A shift in temperature from 20 to 5 degrees C caused a greater decrease in photosynthetic activity, measured by chlorophyll fluorescence and oxygen evolution, in plants exposed to moderate light (350 mu mol m(-2) s(-1)) than in shaded plants (50 mu mol m(-2) s(-1)).In response to the temperature shift, maximal photochemical efficiency of photosystem II (PSII), measured as the ratio of variable to maximal chlorophyll fluorescence (F-v/F-m) of dark-adapted samples, decreased to 70% in exposed seedlings, whereas shaded seedlings maintained F-v/F-m close to initial values. After a further temperature decrease to-5 C, only 8% of initial F-v/F-m remained in exposed plants, whereas shaded plants retained 40% of initial F-v/F-m. Seven days after transfer from-5 to 20 degrees C, recovery of photochemical efficiency was more complete in the shaded plants than in the exposed plants (87 and 65% of the initial F-v/F-m value, respectively). In response to cold stress, the estimated functional absorption cross section per remaining PSII reaction center increased at both irradiances, but the increase was more pronounced in exposed seedlings. Estimates of energy partitioning in the needles showed a much higher dissipative component in the exposed seedlings at low temperatures, pointing to stronger development of non-photochemical quenching at moderate irradiances. The de-epoxidation state of the xanthophyll cycle pigments increased in exposed seedlings at 5 degrees C, contributing to the quenching capacity, whereas significant de-epoxidation in the shaded plants was observed only when temperatures decreased to -5 degrees C. Thermoluminescence (TL) measurements of PSII revealed that charge recombinations between the second oxidation state of Mn-cluster S-2 and the semireduced secondary electron acceptor quinone Q(B)(-) (S(2)Q(B)(-)) were shifted to lower temperatures in cold-acclimated seedlings compared with control seedlings and this effect depended on irradiance. Concomitant with this. cold-acclimated seedlings demonstrated a significant shift in the S2 recombination with primary acceptor Q(A)(-) (S(2)Q(A)(-)) characteristic TL emission peak to higher temperatures, thus narrowing the redox potential gap between S(2)Q(B)(-) and S(2)Q(A)(-), which might result in increased probability for non-radiative radical pair recombination between the PSII reaction center chlorophyll a (P680(+)) and Q(A)(-) (P680(+)Q(A)(-)) (reaction center quenching) in cold-acclimated seedlings. In Scots pine seedlings, mechanisms of quenching excess light energy in winter therefore involve light-dependent regulation of reaction center content and both reaction center-based and antenna-based quenching of excess light energy, enabling them to withstand high excitation pressure under northern winter conditions.									46	1	0	0	44	0	47			0829-318X	1758-4469		WOS:000235728100006	16356904

The PSII core sample was given eight successive flashes with 1 s intervals at 10 degreesC, and FTIR difference spectra upon individual flashes were measured. The obtained difference spectra upon the first to fourth flashes showed considerably different spectral features from each other, whereas the fifth, sixth, seventh, and eighth flash spectra were similar to the first, second, third, and fourth flash spectra, respectively. The intensities at the wavenumbers of prominent peaks of the first and second flash spectra showed clear period four oscillation patterns. These oscillation patterns were well fitted with the Kok model with 13% misses. These results indicate that the first, second, third, and fourth flash spectra represent the difference spectra upon the S-1 --> S-2, S-2 --> S-3, S-3 --> S-0, and S-0 --> S-1 transitions, respectively. In these spectra, prominent bands were observed in the symmetric (1300-1450 cm(-1)) and asymmetric (1500-1600 cm(-1)) stretching regions of carboxylate groups and in the amide I region (1600-1700 cm(-1)). Comparison of the band features suggests that the drastic coordination changes of carboxylate groups and the protein conformational changes in the S-1 --> S-2 and S-2 --> S-3 transitions are reversed in the S-3 --> S-0 and S-0 --> S-1 transitions. The flash-induced FTIR measurements during the S-state cycle will be a promising method to investigate the detailed molecular mechanism of photosynthetic oxygen evolution.									80	0	0	0	62	0	80			0006-2960			WOS:000166942100001	11327807

Among these alternatives, Pd appears as a promising candidate, since its price is typically 2-3 fold lower than that of Pt. With this motivation, the first section of this study displays our attempts at quantifying the kinetic parameters of the HOR/HER on bulk Pd in 0.1 M NaOH, which were prevented by the simultaneous absorption of hydrogen into bulk palladium. We succeeded at circumventing this issue by depositing Pd-adlayers on a polycrystalline Au-substrate by galvanic displacement of underpotentially-deposited Cu or by electrochemical plating of Pd2+. The resulting surfaces appear to consist of three-dimensional Pd-structures of an unknown thickness that we believe to scale with the palladium coverage, theta(Pd/Au). This last parameter is inversely proportional to the HOR/HER-activity of the Pd-on-Au surfaces, in agreement with numerous theoretical and experimental studies in acid media that correlate this effect to the tensile strain induced by the Au-substrate on the Pd-lattice.

At present, obtaining the efficient, stable and inexpensive photocatalyst for photocatalytic overall water splitting is still a huge challenge. Cobalt phosphate (Co3PO4, CoPi) possesses proper band positions for water splitting. However, the fast recombination of photogenerated electron and hole pairs for CoPi restricts its application. Herein, strongly coupling Co3PO4-carbon dots (CoPi-CDs) composite was constructed as an effective strategy to depress the fast recombination behavior of photogenerated electron and hole pairs. CoPi-CDs show superior photocatalytic water splitting activity than that of single CoPi. When the concentration of CDs in the composite is 0.002 g(CDS)/g(catalyst), the hydrogen production rate was obtained for approximately 0.592 mu mol h(-1), as well as the oxygen evolution rate about 0.258 mu mol h(-1) (with 2:1 stoichiometry), which are both nearly 33 times than that of pristine CoPi. This enhanced photocatalytic activity of CoPi-CDs should ascribe to the efficient coupling effect between CoPi and CDs, which allows fast electron transfer at the interface of CoPi and CDs and thus effectively boosts the photocatalytic water splitting. The strongly coupling nanocomposites should be inspiring for further nanocomposite building for photocatalytic overall water splitting. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc.

In contrast, although the concept has long existed, single-atom heterogeneous catalysts (SACs) have only recently gained prominence. Host materials have similar functions to ligands in homogeneous catalysts, determining the stability, local environment, and electronic properties of isolated atoms and thus providing a platform for tailoring heterogeneous catalysts for targeted applications. Within just a decade, we have witnessed many examples of SACs both disrupting diverse fields of heterogeneous catalysis with their distinctive reactivity and substantially enriching our understanding of molecular processes on surfaces. To date, the term SAC mostly refers to late transition metal-based systems, but numerous examples exist in which isolated atoms of other elements play key catalytic roles. This review provides a compositional encyclopedia of SACs, celebrating the 10th anniversary of the introduction of this term. By defining single-atom catalysis in the broadest sense, we explore the full elemental diversity, joining different areas across the whole periodic table, and discussing historical milestones and recent developments. In particular, we examine the coordination structures and associated properties accessed through distinct single-atom-host combinations and relate them to their main applications in thermo-, electro-, and photocatalysis, revealing trends in element-specific evolution, host design, and uses. Finally, we highlight frontiers in the field, including multimetallic SACs, atom proximity control, and possible applications for multistep and cascade reactions, identifying challenges, and propose directions for future development in this flourishing field.									275	11	0	0	14	1	273			0009-2665	1520-6890		WOS:000588271100002	33085890

The protein contains FAD as the sole protein-bound redox-cofactor. Benzoquinones, not replaceable by molecular oxygen, serve as a final electron acceptor defining PDS as a 15-cis-phytoene (donor): plastoquinone oxidoreductase. The herbicidal PDS-inhibitor norflurazon is capable of arresting the reaction by stabilizing the intermediary FAD(red), while an excess of the quinone acceptor relieves this blockage, indicating competition. The enzyme requires its homo-oligomeric association for activity. The sum of data collected through gel permeation chromatography, non-denaturing polyacrylamide electrophoresis, chemical cross-linking, mass spectrometry and electron microscopy techniques indicate that the high-order oligomers formed in solution are the basis for an active preparation. Of these, a tetramer consisting of dimers represents the active unit. This is corroborated by our preliminary X-ray structural analysis that also revealed similarities of the protein fold with the sequence-inhomologous bacterial phytoene desaturase CRTI and other oxidoreductases of the GR2-family of flavoproteins. This points to an evolutionary relatedness of CRTI and PDS yielding different carotene desaturation sequences based on homologous protein folds.									24	5	0	0	25	0	28			1932-6203			WOS:000358157600134	26147209

Pervasive fluid infiltration was found to modify the mineralogical and geochemical architecture of the fault zones studied. Enrichment/depletion patterns, element partitioning, and a very large implied volume loss are quite different from those characterizing faults in granites and clastic sedimentary rocks and can be explained by a mass removal model involving dissolution and advective transport enhanced by pressure solution. An increasing enrichment in smectite observed toward the principal slip surface, a high abundance of elements such as Ba, Mg, and F, the deposition of minerals such as barite and fluorapatite, as well as the distinct depletion in C-13 in vein material consistently suggest reactions involving a hydrothermal fluid originating at depth. Illitization of black gouges, caused by coseismic frictional heating, was found to be widespread. We propose that coseismic frictional heating along with the action of postseismic hydrothermal fluids controlled the transformation and distribution of smectite and illite within the fault core of the Longmenshan Fault Zone. The coseismic dewatering reactions are expected to have been more extensive at depth, possibly helping generate excess pore pressure assisting dynamic slip weakening during the Wenchuan Earthquake.

Characterization of Carbon Ablation Models Including Effects of Gas-Phase Chemical Kinetics								JOURNAL OF THERMOPHYSICS AND HEAT TRANSFER				31	3			512	526		10.2514/1.T4752				JUL-SEP 2017	2017	The modeling of the oxidation and sublimation of carbon-based ablative thermal protection system materials remains an area of active research. In this paper, two gas-surface interaction models for carbon are studied at representative reentry conditions. One model is based on the widely used B approach with an equilibrium saturated state assumption for the surface composition, and the second uses a detailed finite-rate chemical kinetics model for the gas-surface reactions. Key modeling parameters are varied in the finite-rate model to assess its sensitivity to modeling uncertainties. The gas-phase chemical kinetics models are also varied to characterize their effects on the ablation process. The models were evaluated using a generic sphere-cone geometry at four representative reentry conditions. It is found that there are notable differences in the predicted overall surface mass flux, and particularly in the details of the individual species mass fluxes to and from the surface. In addition, the gas-phase kinetic model is found to have important effects on the surface kinetics and the flux of individual species at the surface. From this study, it is clear that more detailed measurements of surface gas evolution under tightly controlled conditions are required to validate and improve the mechanism-based gas-surface interaction model for carbon. The B approach does not capture the interaction of the nonequilibrium state of the gas interacting with the surface, making that approach highly suspect for many of the conditions studied.									6	1	0	0	0	0	7			0887-8722	1533-6808		WOS:000405487900003

Here, TiO2 and Polyaniline (PAni) nanoparticles were anchored over SGO and the resulting SGO-TiO2-PAni nanocomposites were used as a potential cathode catalyst in MFCs. We have also examined the performance of SGO-TiO2-PAni compared to GO-TiO2-PAni and TiO2-PAni catalyst. The structural and morphological analyses were examined using a variety of characterization techniques. TiO2 nanoparticles bridged PAni and SGO through hydrogen bonding/electrostatic interaction and improved the thermal stability of SGO-TiO2-PAni catalyst. The electrochemical characterizations of these nanocatalysts suggest that the SGO-TiO2-PAni showed higher reduction current value (-0.46 mA), enhanced stability, and lower internal resistance (46.2 Omega) in comparison to GO-TiO2-PAni and TiO2-PAni towards oxygen reduction reactions (ORR). Consequently, MFC using SGO-TiO2-PAni demonstrated a maximum power density of 904.18 mWm(-2) than that of GO-TiO2-PAni (734.12 mWm(-2)), TiO2-PAni (561.5 mWm(-2)) and Pt/C (483.5 mWm(-2)). The enhanced catalytic activity of SGO-TiO(2-)PAni catalyst was ascribed to the high electronic conductivity and long-term permanence of the nanocomposite. These superior electrochemical results suggested that the SGO-TiO2-PAni catalyst could be applied as a potential alternative to the commercial Pt/C cathode catalyst for the application of MFCs.									33	1	0	0	5	0	34			0928-4931	1873-0191		WOS:000510956400121	31924014

In this paper, TiO2 nanoparticles with different crystalline sizes were prepared by adjusting the alkali-hydrothermal time (0-48 h). An annealing in N-2 atmosphere after hydrothermal treatment caused TiO2 reduction and created defects, resulting in the visible light photocatalytic activity. The evolution of physicochemical properties along with the increase of hydrothermal time at a low alkali concentration has been revealed. Compared with other TiO2 samples, TiO2-24 showed higher photocatalytic activity toward degrading Rhodamine B and Sulfadiazine under visible light. The radical trapping and ESR experiments revealed that O-2(center dot-) is the main reactive specie in TiO2-24. Large specific surface areas and rapid transfer of photogenerated electrons are responsible for enhancing photocatalytic activity. The above findings clearly demonstrate that particle size and surface oxygen defects can be regulated by alkali-hydrothermal method. This research will deepen the understanding of particle size on the nanomaterials performance and provide new ideas for designing efficient photocatalysts.									87	1	0	0	14	1	88				2079-4991		WOS:000526090400146	32197421

In this work, the behaviour of a Ce0.8Tb0.2O2-x, mixed-oxide sample and the corresponding oxide-supported Rh and Pt samples has been investigated. Special attention has been paid to the low-temperature redox response. Temperature-programmed desorption (TPD), temperature-programmed reduction and oxygen buffering capacity were used as experimental techniques. The evolution of reducibility was also followed by tunable high-energy x-ray photoemission spectroscopy, focussing on the surface information provided by Th 3d and Ce 3d core levels. The oxidation state of both Ce and Tb was followed during ultrahigh vacuum annealing of the three samples up to 750 K. Comparison of the XPS spectra for the different samples before and after annealing showed that the Ce4+ reduction was negligible but Tb4+ was gradually reduced to Tb3+. Furthermore, the TPD and XPS experiments are in good agreement, with the highest reduction rate corresponding to the Rh/CeTbOx sample.

Scanning electron microscopy with an energy dispersive spectrometer, X-ray diffraction and contact angle goniometry confirmed that ODP was successfully embedded into the beta-PbO2 layer of Ti/Sn-SbOx/PbO2-ODP, increasing the water contact angle at the electrode surface from 75.9 degrees to 133.9 degrees. The Ti/Sn-SbOx/PbO2-ODP electrode exhibited excellent electrocatalytic oxidation of ciprofloxacin (CIP). The pseudo first-order rate constant for CIP removal was 3.92 h(-1) at an electrolytic potential of 10 V, 2.6 times greater than that when using the unmodified electrode. Moreover, electrode stability was greatly improved after ODP modification. The Ti/Sn-SbOx/PbO2-ODP electrode had longer accelerated life (324 h) than the Ti/Sn-SbOx/PbO2 electrode (91 h). The enhanced electrocatalytic performance of Ti/Sn-SbOx/PbO2-ODP was attributed to improved utilization of hydroxyl radicals (center dot OH) resulting from higher oxygen evolution potential. Furthermore, the hydrophobic surface of Ti/Sn-SbOx/PbO2-ODP was beneficial for stronger adsorption of CIP, as evidenced by the initial surface concentration test.

For ascertaining if above mentioned changes are due to disturbance in plasma membrane integrity or proteins, fatty acid profiling and proteomics were done. Gas chromatographic (GC) analysis of fatty acid methyl esters (FAME) depicted a decrease in alpha-linolenic acid (C18:3) which appears responsible for plasma membrane instability. Enhanced lipid peroxidation and electrolyte leakage further attested the butachlor-induced cell damage. Butachlor-treated Aulosira exhibited significant and reproducible alternations in eight proteins as assessed by 2DE and LC-MS analysis of which phycocyanin alpha-chain, allophycocyanin beta-chain, C-phycocyanin alpha-subunit, ATP synthase beta-chain and FBP aldolase were associated with photosynthesis and respiration, peroxiredoxin with antioxidative defense system and GroES and NusB with protein folding and transcription termination respectively.

Reverse transcription PCR of the protein genes affirmed that aforesaid proteins were the gene products not artifacts. Downregulated GroES and over expressed NusB are critical proteins for cell death.

No life on earth can live without iron. Persistent oxidative stress resulting from continuous use of iron and oxygen may be a fundamental cause of carcinogenesis. Many animal models demonstrated that excess iron may lead to carcinogenesis. This is supported by a variety of human epidemiological data on cancer risk and prognosis. Cancer is basically a disease of the genome with persistently activated oncogenes and inactivated tumor suppressor genes through which iron addiction with ferroptosis-resistance is established. We predict that fine use of nanomaterials and non-thermal plasma may be able to reverse this situation.Evolution from the first life on earth to humans took similar to 3.8 billion years. During the time there have been countless struggles among the species. Mycobacterium tuberculosis was the last major uncontrollable species against the human public health worldwide. After the victory with antibiotics, cancer has become the leading cause of death since 1981 in Japan. Considering that life inevitably depends on ceaseless electron transfers through iron and oxygen, we believe that carcinogenesis is intrinsically unavoidable side effects of using iron and oxygen. Many animal models unequivocally revealed that excess iron is a risk for carcinogenesis. This is supported by a variety of human epidemiological data on cancer risk and prognosis. Cancer is basically a disease of the genome with persistently activated oncogenes and inactivated tumor suppressor genes through which iron addiction with ferroptosis-resistance is maintained. Engineering has made a great advance in the past 50 years. In particular, nanotechnology is distinct in that the size of the engineered molecules is similar to that of our biomolecules. While some nano-molecules are found carcinogenic, there are principles to avoid such carcinogenicity with a smart possibility to use nano-molecules to specifically kill cancer cells. Non-thermal plasma is another modality to fight against cancer.									11	0	0	0	11	0	11				2072-6694		WOS:000592957300001	33182727

The bimetallic Co-Zn-ZIFs (BMZIFs) was selected as the sacrifice template due to not only its high nitrogen content and regular porosity but also the superiority that Zn species in BMZIFs can both spatially separate Co species to suppress the aggregation of ultra-small Co NPs and be evaporated to afford extra pores during high-temperature pyrolysis. As expected, by adjusting the starting molar ratio of Zn to Co, we were able to prepare Co-HNCS-x (x represent the molar ratio of Co to total starting metal feeding) that exhibited unique hollow structure with large surface areas, enhanced mass transport, high porosities, tunable particle sizes and graphitization degrees, abundant highly active CoNx sites, and thus significantly improved ORR performance. Particularly, the optimal Co-HNCS-0.2 exhibited the remarkable ORR activity (the onset and half-wave potentials were 0.94 and 0.82 V vs. RHE, respectively) via an efficient four-electron-dominant ORR process in alkaline medium, which outperformed that of commercial Pt/C (20 wt%, the onset and half-wave potentials were 0.93 and 0.80 V vs. RHE, respectively) and most of previously reported Co-based catalysts. Moreover, it also displayed much superior stability and tolerance to methanol as compared to Pt/C, further highlighting the merit of this facile synthesis approach. Our findings might inspire new thoughts on the development of precious-metal-free, highly-efficient and cost-effective ORR electrocatalysts derived from MOF.									70	2	0	0	9	0	73			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000414083300070

The growing film was exposed to a flux of atomic oxygen supplied from an oxygen radical beam source at a total deposition pressure of 1 x 10(-5) mbar. The properties of as-deposited 1000 Angstrom thick films on silicon substrates have been studied in the growth temperature interval 100-680 degrees C. X-ray diffractometry demonstrated a phase evolution as a function of growth temperature, from amorphous (100 degrees C) to anatase (300 degrees C) and eventually rutile (680 degrees C). While the amorphous film surface had a smooth film surface as evidenced by atomic force microscopy, the anatase and rutile specimens exhibited a grain-like morphology. No apparent difference in surface roughness was observed between the anatase and rutile phase. Secondary ion mass spectrometry indicated that silicon diffused into the rutile film grown at the highest temperature. Ellipsometry measurements revealed that the crystallized films exhibited significantly larger refractive index and absorption than the amorphous film. Current-voltage (C-V) measurements demonstrated that the leakage was very high in the amorphous and anatase films (3-5 A/cm(2) at 0.3 MV/cm). With increasing amount of rutile phase, the leakage current decreased resulting in a leakage current density of 70 nA/cm(2) at an electrical field of 0.3 MV/cm for; rutile films grown at 680 degrees C. High-frequency C-V measurements on rutile films resulted in typical metal-insulator semiconductor behavior with a measured static dielectric constant of 39. (C) 1998 American Vacuum Society.

Nevertheless, there still remain contradictions regarding the role of the dopants played in photocatalysis. Herein, ultrathin ZnIn2S4 (ZIS) nanosheets with oxygen doping were synthesized by a one-pot solvothermal method. XRD, XPS and Raman spectral measurements support the presence of lattice oxygen in the oxygen-doped ZIS (O-ZIS) sample. With optimum doping of oxygen, the ultrathin O-ZIS nanosheets show enhanced CO2-to-CO conversion activity with a CO-evolving rate of 1680 lmol h(-1) g(-1) under visible light irradiation, which is about 7 times higher than that of the pristine ZIS. First-principle calculations support that doping of oxygen in the lattice of ZnI2S4 nanosheets plays a key role in tuning its electronic properties. The remarkable photocatalytic performance of O-ZIS can be assigned to a synergistic consequence of a unique ultrathin-layered structure and an upward shift of the conduction band minimum (CBM) caused by the oxygen doping into ZIS and the quantum confinement effect (QCE) induced by the decreased particle size after doping as well as to the improved charge separation efficiency. The present work offers a simple elemental doping method to promote charge separation at atomic level and illustrates the roles played by oxygen doping in photocatalysis, giving new insights into highly efficient artificial photosynthesis.

The computations start shortly after bounce and include neutrino-matter interactions by using a lightbulb approximation for the neutrinos and a treatment of the nucleosynthesis due to explosive silicon and oxygen burning. We find that newly formed iron-group elements are distributed throughout the inner half of the helium core by Rayleigh-Taylor instabilities at the (Ni + Si)/O and (C + O)/He interfaces, seeded by convective overturn during the early stages of the explosion. Fast-moving nickel mushrooms with velocities up to similar to 4000 km s(-1) are observed. This offers a natural explanation for the mixing required in light-curve and spectral synthesis studies of Type Ib explosions. A continuation of the calculations to later times, however, indicates that the iron velocities observed in SN 1987A cannot be reproduced because of a strong deceleration of the clumps in the dense shell left behind by the shock at the He/H interface.									126	1	1	0	0	1	128			0004-637X			WOS:000086201500010	10688768

Members of the 2D MXenes family, particularly Mo2CTx, have recently been identified as promising HER catalysts. However, their inherent oxidative instability in air and aqueous electrolyte solutions is hindering their widespread use. Herein, we present a simple and scalable method to circumvent adventitious oxidation in Mo2CTx MXenes via in situ sulfidation to form a Mo2CTx/2H-MoS2 nanohybrid. The intimate epitaxial coupling at the Mo2CTx/2H-MoS2 nanohybrid interface afforded superior HER activities, requiring only 119 or 182 mV overpotential to yield -10 or -100 mA cm(geom)(-2) current densities, respectively. Density functional theory calculations reveal strongest interfacial adhesion was found within the nanohybrid structure as compared to the physisorbed nanohybrid, and the possibility to tune the HER overpotential through manipulating the extent of MXene sulfidation. Critically, the presence of 2H-MoS2 suppresses further oxidation of the MXene layer, enabling the nanohybrid to sustain industrially relevant current densities of over -450 mA cm(geom)(-2) with exceptional durability. Less than 30 mV overpotential degradation was observed after 10 continuous days of electrolysis at a fixed -10 mA cm(geom)(-2) current density or 100,000 successive cyclic voltammetry cycles. The exceptional HER durability of the Mo2CTx/2H-MoS2 nanohybrid presents a major step forward to realize practical implementation of MXenes as noble metal free catalysts for broad-based applications in water splitting and energy conversion.									82	5	0	0	5	0	84			1936-0851	1936-086X		WOS:000595533800155	33186028

However, the energy consumption is subject to the high oxygen evolution potential (OEP) of the traditional electrode. Doped Ir-contained oxides electrode is capable of degrading pollutants efficiently at low energy consumption. In this study, a facile (Ir0.4Pr0.4Si0.2)O-x electrode was prepared using the thermal decomposition method, which exhibits a larger electrochemical surface area (ECSA, 287.71 cm(2)) and tunnel structures caused by Pr and Si's leaching. The (Ir0.4Pr0.4Si0.2)O-x electrode was applied to degrade sulfadiazine (SDZ). The parameters of the initial concentration of SDZ, electrolyte concentration, pH, and the applied voltage on SDZ removal were investigated. The optimal condition was explored, and the SDZ degradation efficiency reached 100% within 2 h. We attribute the excellent degradation performance to the presence of tunnel structures on the electrode, which promotes the generation of center dot O-2(-) and center dot OH. An indirect electrochemical oxidation mechanism is proposed according to the identification of the intermediate through the LC-MS. The novel electrode achieved in this work is promising to treat acid SDZ wastewater in the electrochemical system.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			1572-6657	1873-2569		WOS:000648498200019

Energy was released into the film by ion bombardment, with the aim of promoting formation of Si nanoclusters and reordering the oxide matrix. The effect of the initial stoichiometry, as well as the evolution of the oxide films due to the ion bombardment and to subsequent thermal treatments, has been studied by depth-resolved positron annihilation Doppler spectroscopy, Raman scattering and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. As-deposited films were found to contain an open volume fraction in the form of subnanometric cavities that are positively correlated with oxygen deficiency. No Si aggregates were observed. The ion bombardment was found to promote the formation of amorphous Si nanoclusters, together with a reduction of the open volume in the matrix and a substantial release of hydrogen. It also leaves electrically active sites in the oxide and produces gas-filled vacancy defects in the substrate, with the concentrations depending on the implantation temperature. Thermal treatment at 500degreesC removes charge defects in the oxide, but vacancy defects are not completely annealed even at 1100degreesC. In one case, heating at 1100degreesC produced cavities of about 0.6 nm in the oxide. Transformation of Si nanoclusters into nanocrystals is observed to occur from 800degreesC.

J	Fan, Weidong; Li, Yu; Guo, Qinghong; Chen, Can; Wang, Yong								Coal-nitrogen release and NOx evolution in the oxidant-staged combustion of coal								ENERGY				125				417	426		10.1016/j.energy.2017.02.130				APR 15 2017	2017	Air-staged combustion is one of the most sophisticated and effective technologies for reducing NOx emissions. To better understand NOx formation and destruction in air-staged combustion, measurements of the major gas species and NOx profiles along the axial distance of a furnace were obtained in a 20 kW down-fired pilot-scale combustion facility. The furnace of this facility has a representative configuration of a full-scale boiler with a staged combustion system in terms of residence times and temperature characteristics. The combustion air is divided into primary air, secondary air, and burnout air, which can be heated to 80 degrees C, 200 degrees C, and 200 degrees C, respectively by electric heaters before entering the furnace. Under the staged case, a usual NOx trend was obtained by the measurements: coal nitrogen can be rapidly converted to NOx and then reaches a peak concentration in the primary combustion zone, followed by a significant reduction in NOx in the reduction zone. The greater the staged level is, the earlier the reduction stage starts. For the deepest air-staged case with ratio of burnout air to total air of 0.42, the NOx profile curve does not exhibit the features of the NOx peak and a pronounced reduction, as the NOx values are always at very low levels. There exists an NO reducing saturation phenomenon in an overlong reduction zone. For providing data associated with the oxygen-enriched combustion technology that will be available in the near future, low-level oxygen-enriched combustions of coal (21-30%O-2) have been performed to assess their NOx emission characteristics compared to the air-staged configuration. There is no essential difference in the mechanism of NO formation and destruction between the staged combustion with oxygen enrichment and the air-staged combustion. With the increase of the staged degree, the impact of O-2 concentration promotion on the rise of NOx emission gradually decreases. The NOx rises again at the point where burnout oxidizer addition is caused by the oxidation of some unknown nitrogen-containing intermediates prevailing in the oxygen-poor reduction zone.

The application of photocatalytic water splitting technology in hydrogen production is important for sustainable energy development and environmental protection. In this study, for the first time, 2D Cu7S4 co-catalysts were coupled on the surface of a CdS nanosheet photocatalyst by a one-step ultrasonic-assisted electrostatic self-assembly method at room temperature. The as-fabricated 2D-2D CdS/Cu7S4 layered heterojunctions were demonstrated to be advanced composite photocatalysts that enhance the water splitting efficiency toward hydrogen production. The highest hydrogen evolution rate of the 2D-2D CdS/2%Cu7S4 binary heterojunction photocatalyst was up to 27.8 mmol g(-1) h(-1) under visible light irradiation, with an apparent quantum efficiency of 14.7% at 420 nm, which was almost 10.69 times and 2.65 times higher than those of pure CdS nanosheets (2.6 mmol g(-1) h(-1)) and CdS-2%CuS (10.5 mmol g(-1) h(-1)), respectively. The establishment of the CdS/Cu7S4 binary-layered heterojunction could not only enhance the separation of photogenerated electron-hole (e(-)-h(+)) pairs, improve the transfer of photo-excited electrons, and prolong the life-span of photo-generated electrons, but also enhance the light absorption and hydrogen-evolution kinetics. All these factors are important for the enhancement of the photocatalytic activity. Expectedly, the 2D-2D interface coupling strategy based on CdS NSs can be extensively exploited to improve the hydrogen-evolution activity over various kinds of conventional semiconductor NSs.

This approach should be applicable for the creation of RNA molecules that can bind to and identify the different modifications of DNA produced by a variety of environmental agents.									17	1	0	0	8	0	27			0027-8424			WOS:000076222200024	9751715

The interaction between halogen and oxygen atoms has been characterized by the presence of bonding, disynaptic attractors V(O,X) X=F, Cl, Br, and I with the mean electron population (N) over bar of 0.32, 0.61, 0.35e, and 0.35e, respectively. In the case of HOBr, the possibility of a strong contribution of 3d bromine core electrons to the valence shell has been observed. On the base of the bonding evolution theory (BET), the O-F bond has been recognized as a covalent, polarized one whereas, the bonding between O and Cl, Br, and I atoms is of the electron donor-acceptor-type with halogen donating the electron density to valence shell of oxygen. The observed difference between HO+F- and HO-X+ (X=Cl, Br, and I) polarizations is reflected in topology of ELF maps with a large localization domain surrounding the V(F) and V(F,O) attractors in HOF and a common superbasin encompassing the V(O,H), V(O), and V(X,O) attractors in HOCl, HOBr, and HOI. The very large values of the relative quantum fluctuation (lambda), above 0.8, found for V(O,X) suggest that the covalent electron density is almost entirely delocalized over other basins. The comparison of the mean electron population ((N) over bar) of the V(H,X) and V(H,O) basins computed for hydrohalic (HX) and hypohalous acids (HOX) has revealed that the population alters in line with values of Delta E-acid, therefore can be used as a approximate measure of acidic properties of molecules. The topological analysis of the ELF function supports the concept of probonded electronegativity and its usefulness as a tool for prediction of the nature of the oxygen-halogen linkage.

The kinetics of the alpha-Ni(OH)(2) decomposition to Ni was studied in situ and the decomposition mechanism was proposed. The nickel metal nucleation begins at the anion vacancies on the film vertical bar solution interface and finally the whole oxide film matrix transforms to the new metallic phase. The hydrogen evolution reaction (h.e.r.) takes place at a potential more positive than E-r(H-2/H+) at a freshly, in situ extracted Ni surface.The semiconducting properties of the passive film were compared to those of an oxide film, also n-type semiconductor that is formed on Ni by ion-implantation method.The latter film mentioned shows compact, more ordered and less amorphous structure than the first one what is in accordance to the X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) results.

Herein, we successfully fabricated 0D/2D Au/TiO2 plasmon Ohmic-junction composites, which exhibit excellent photocatalytic activity of CO2 reduction to CH4. The main reduction products of the optimized 0D/2D Au/TiO2 heterojunction are CH4 and CO obtained at the rates of 70.34 and 19.75 mu mol.g(-1).h(-1), respectively, with 80% CH4 selectivity. Transmission electron microscopy, UV-vis diffuse reflection spectra and photo-electrochemical tests along with density functional theory calculations confirm that the improved photocatalytic CO2 reduction performance and high CH4 selectivity are attributed to the synergistic effects between plasmonic Au NPs and Ohmic-junction of Au and TiO2, which can effectively enhance the separation and transportation of photo generated carriers and promote a multi-electron reduction reaction of CO2 and H2O, resulting in high selectivity of CH4 generation. These results also indicate that the Au/TiO2 plasmon Ohmic-junction can act as a highly effective CO2 reduction photocatalyst for future applications of energy conversion.									52	3	0	0	3	0	52			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000502007800046

Powered by NiMoO4 as homologous bimetallic precursor, the Ni-Mo2C-CNF possesses numerous in-situ formed Ni-Mo2C interfaces, which facilitates the synergistic effect between Ni and Mo2C, improving the conductivity and thus boosting the electrocatalytic performance towards HER. In the meantime, the porous carbon nanofibers with well encapsulated Ni-Mo2C active components stacks, constituting conductive network, which promotes the mass transport, electron transfer, active sites exposure and electrocatalytic stability. As a result, the Ni-Mo2C-CNF features prominently in HER, as it demands a low overpotential of 196 mV but is able to stably yield the current density of 10 mA cm(-2) with a small Tafel plot of 54.7 mV dec(-1). The method demonstrated in our work to synthesize bimetallic heterostructured materials will offer valuable inspiration to construct promising non-precious electrocatalysts for diverse vital renewable energy applications.

Copper nitrate (Cu(NO3)(2)) solution with the copolymer surfactant Pluronic (R) F-127 (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA, generic name, poloxamer 407) was loaded onto WO3 substrates by programmed dip coating, followed by heat treatment in air at 550 degrees C. The Cu2+ reacted with the WO3 substrate to form the CuWO4 compound. The composite WO3/CuWO4 thin films demonstrated improved photoelectrochemical (PEC) performance over WO3 and CuWO4 single phase photoanodes. The factors of light absorption and charge separation efficiency of the composite and two single phase films were investigated to understand the reasons for the PEC enhancement of WO3/CuWO4 composite thin films. The photocurrent was generated from water splitting as confirmed by hydrogen and oxygen gas evolution, and Faradic efficiency was calculated based on the amount of H-2 produced. This work provides a low-cost and controllable method to prepare WO3-metal tungstate composite thin films, and also helps to deepen the understanding of charge transfer in WO3/CuWO4 heterojunction.									25	2	0	0	0	0	25			1996-1944			WOS:000378628500043

A mesoporous hybrid catalyst of nickel phosphides nanoparticles and cobalt phosphosulfide/phosphide (CoS|Ni|P) nanosheet arrays for HER is reported here, which is developed by a facile three-step approach consisting of electrodeposition, thermal sulfurization, and phosphorization. This hybrid catalyst is highly robust and stable in acid for HER, and is distinguished by very low overpotentials of 41, 88, and 150 mV to achieve 10, 100, and 1000 mA cm(-2), respectively, as well as a small Tafel slope (45.2 mV dec(-1)), and a large exchange current density (964 mu A cm(-2)). It is among the most efficient earth-abundant catalysts reported thus far for HER. More importantly, this electrocatalyst has electrochemical durability over 20 h under a wide range of current densities (up to 1 A cm(-2)) in acidic conditions, as well as very high turnover frequencies of 0.40 and 1.26 H-2 s(-1) at overpotentials of 75 and 100 mV, respectively, showing that it has great potential for practical applications in large-scale water electrolysis.									87	5	0	0	3	0	88			1613-6810	1613-6829		WOS:000458313900013	30637939

The rate of peroxide production is maximal at pH 7.2 at low sucrose concentrations and at concentrations of Cl- (1.5-3.0 mM) that limit the rate of the oxidation of water to O2. The rate of H2O2 production increased with pH from pH 6.8 to 7.2 and was inversely proportional to the oxidation of water to O2 from pH 6.8 to 7.5. While EDTA does not inhibit H2O2 production, this reaction is abolished by 5 mM NH2OH and inhibited by the same concentrations of NH3 that affect water oxidation which indicates that the oxygen-evolving complex is responsible for the production of peroxide generated upon illumination of PSII core preparations. These results support a mechanism in which bound Cl- in the S2 state is displaced by OH- ions which are then oxidized by the OEC to form H2O2. Thus, the OEC requires Cl- to prevent access to the active site of the OEC until four oxidizing equivalents can be generated to allow the oxidation of water to O2.									61	0	0	0	51	0	61			0006-2960			WOS:A1992KB73700033	1457417

The effects of introducing Pt interlayer were evaluated by physicochemical and electrochemical measurements. We calculated the texture coefficients of SnO2 crystals growing on Ti and Ti/Pt substrates according to the XRD data, and found the SnO2 crystalline grains growing on Ti and Ti/Pt having the different preferred orientations. Hence, we used the first-principles method building three kinds of supercells along diverse preferred orientations (110), (101) and (211) to simulate three types SnO2 crystalline grains. The computation results indicated the conductivity of supercell built along the (101) face was better than that of (211) face supercell. Furthermore, electrochemical tests such as linear sweep voltammetry (LSV), chronopotentiometry and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) had been carried out on the Ti/Pt/Sb-SnO2 electrodes. We also discussed the changes of oxygen evolution overpotential and charge transfer resistant on the Ti/Pt/Sb-SnO2 electrodes in a physical perspective.									19	1	0	0	3	0	20			1572-6657	1873-2569		WOS:000413880700019

Transition metal dichalcogenides (MX2), most notably group-6 MX2 (e.g., MoS2 and WS2), are appealing catalysts for the HER alternative to the best, but highly expensive, Pt-group elements. However, their HER activity is typically restricted to their edge sites rather than their basal plane. Furthermore, their semiconducting properties hinder an efficient electron transfer to the catalytic sites, which impedes a high rate of H-2 production. Herein, we exploit liquid-phase exfoliation-produced metallic (1H, 2H and 3R) NbS2 nanoflakes, belonging to the class of metallic layered group-5 MX2, to overcome the abovementioned limitations. Both chemical treatment with hygroscopic Li salt and electrochemical in operando self-nanostructuring are exploited to improve the NbS2 nanoflake HER activity. The combination of NbS2 with other MX2, in our case MoSe2, also provides heterogeneous catalysts accelerating the HER kinetics of the individual counterparts. The designed NbS2-based catalysts exhibit an overpotential at a cathodic current of 10 mA cm(-2) (eta(10)) as low as 0.10 and 0.22 V vs. RHE in 0.5 M H2SO4 and 1 M KOH, respectively. In 0.5 M H2SO4, the HER activity of the NbS2-based catalysts is also superior to those of the Pt/C benchmark at current densities higher than 80 mA cm(-2). Our work provides general guidelines for a scalable and cost-effective exploitation of NbS2, as well as the entire MX2 portfolio, for attaining a viable H-2 production through electrochemical routes.									34	1	0	0	1	0	34			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000498556500038

The method is versatile for various monomers including cyanamide, dicyanamide and melamine as well as different substrates. The role of deposition temperature and amount of monomers has been investigated in detail. Structural and surface morphological studies suggest uniform and pinhole-free g-CN films could be achieved with this feasible method. Photon-induced oxygen evolution upon anodic polarization in aqueous electrolytes brings up a photocurrent density of 63 mu A cm(-2) for the g-CN films prepared with dicyanamide. This is the highest value to date for a pristine g-CN photoanode at the bias of 1.23 V (versus reversible hydrogen electrode) without sacrificial reagents. The good performance could be attributed to an enhanced light harvesting and decreased charge transport resistance at the film/electrolyte interface with an increase of amount of monomers. Accordingly, the strategy of TVD brings g-CN another step to applying as photoactive material in various photoelectronic fields. Furthermore, this method can also be easily extended to synthesis of heterojunction in the second-step of TVD process by choosing proper substrates to further enhance the PEC properties.

An elevation in operating temperature is found to activate minority carrier hopping in metal oxide photoanodes. Here, the photothermal effect of carbon quantum dots (CQDs) is introduced in the PEC water splitting process. Upon NIR light irradiation, the temperature of the CQDs/Fe2O3/TiO(2)photoanode is increased instantly due to the photothermal conversion, thereby stimulating the charge transport in the bulk of the photoanode. Cobalt-phosphate (Co-Pi) acting as an oxygen evolution cocatalyst is deposited on the surface of the photoanodes to accelerate the water oxidation kinetics, and its catalytic activity is also promoted due to the temperature elevation. Consequently, a remarkable photocurrent of similar to 3.0 mA cm(-2)at 1.23 Vversusa reversible hydrogen electrode (V-RHE) for the judiciously designed Co-Pi/CQDs/Fe2O3/TiO(2)photoelectrodes is achieved under NIR light irradiation. These findings verify that the introduction of the photothermal effect is simple yet general, providing a unique platform to capitalize on the photothermal characteristics to boost the PEC performance of photoelectrodes.									23	1	0	0	1	0	24			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000555361700006

The formation of a stable ligand-free IrO(x center dot)nH(2)O was performed by hydrolyzing IrCl3 center dot 3H(2)O in alkaline solution followed by acid condensation process. The conversion of hydrolyzed Ir to the IrO(x center dot)nH(2)O particles at different pH and aging times are evaluated by the UV-visible spectroscopy. Stable IrOx suspension was prepared at pH 11 in 10 h aging time. Potentiostatic and dynamic potential sweep methods were used for the electrodeposition of IrOx. The cyclic voltammetry analysis on the formation of IrOx indicates that an anodic potential of 0.6 V (vs. SCE) is required for IrOx deposition. The results show that the electrodeposition process based on dynamic potential sweeps enhances the yield of IrOx and the electrocatalytic activity toward the oxygen evolution. The presence of both h(ll) and Ir(IV) which was observed using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy confirms the reversible transition of Ir(111)/Ir(Iv) occurs during the growth of IrOx on the surface.

During its evolution, they have developed various ecophysiological adaptation strategies to survive in extreme conditions. The environment prevailing under biofloc cultures provides various conditions appropriate for cyanobacterial proliferation. An outdoor experiment (7weeks) was performed with a simple random design consisting of four inoculation levels (by triplicate) of Oscillatoria sp. (0.0, 0.1, 0.5 and 1mgL(-1)) in saltwater biofloc. The objective was to evaluate the effect of the cyanobacteria inoculation on water quality and tilapia production parameters. The results indicated that the amount of Oscillatoria sp. inoculated significantly affected water quality (pH, chlorophyll a, TSS and NO3-N) and tilapia parameters (final weight, feed conversion ratio, specific growth rate and survival). No significant effects on dissolved oxygen, total ammonia nitrogen (TAN) or NO2-N were observed. We recommend identifying the cyanobacteria species that are able to grow in a biofloc system and their possible adverse effects on the system.									11	0	0	0	12	0	13			1355-557X	1365-2109		WOS:000407278400012

The Co-Pi/BiVO4/ZnO ND photoanode is fully-depleted at 0.8 V vs. the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) by the electric fields developed in radial directions of the nanorods and branches. Driven by the electric fields, the photogenerated electron-hole pairs in the whole electrode are efficiently separated and then the holes swiftly drift to the photoanode/electrolyte interface for oxygen evolution. Rather than diffusion, charge transport mechanism is governed by drift in the fully-depleted ND heterojunction array photoanode. As a result, in the high-light-harvesting BiVO4/ZnO ND array photoanode, the obstacle of slow charge transport in BiVO4 can be surmounted due to the construction of the light absorption and hole drifting paths in different directions. The photocurrent density of the Co-Pi/BiVO4/ZnO ND photoanode is optimized to be 3.5 mA cm(-2) at 1.23 V vs. RHE.									107	9	0	0	8	0	109			2211-2855	2211-3282		WOS:000397003700028

Here, we prepare laminated Ti/Al2O3 composite via tap-casting and hot-press sintering at 1500 degrees C with an applied pressure of 30 MPa for 1.5 h to improve its mechanical performance. Compact laminated structure and crack deflections emerged in a distinct interfacial region were observed. The EDS and XRD results demonstrate that aluminum (Al) and oxygen (O) elements transmit through the interface to titanium (Ti) layers and react with Ti to form Al-Ti intermetallic compounds, titanium oxides and solid solutions of Al-Ti-O. Meanwhile, triple junction boundary emerging in interface is evaluated by Zener's relation. Finally, the schematic illustration of microstructure evolution indicates that the hybrid fracture mode (e.g. trans-granular fracture, inter-granular fracture and the co-existing mode) results in the crack deflection.

The test results of X-ray diffraction, field-emission scanning electron microscopy and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy confirm that Sm2O3 is successfully composited with PbO2. The coating of Ti/PbO2-Sm2O3 composite electrode stacked by typical pyramid-like micro-particles exhibits smooth and compact surface morphology which is conducive to enhancing the corrosion resistance of electrode. Furthermore, electrochemical performance tests indicate that Ti/PbO2-Sm2O3 composite electrode has advantages of higher oxygen evolution potential, lower charge transfer resistance and longer lifetime over Ti/PbO2 electrode. Electrolyte concentration, plate space, initial pH and cell voltage are assessed to optimize the degradation condition of AYR. The results show that COD removal efficiency and degradation efficiency of AYR on Ti/PbO2-Sm2O3 composite electrode reach up to 79.90% and 80.00% under the optimal conditions (Na2SO4 electrolyte concentration 9.0 g L-1, plate space 3.0 cm, initial pH 5, cell voltage 3.0 V and electrolysis time 150 min), respectively. The degradation of AYR follows pseudo-first-order reaction kinetics, and a plausible mineralization pathway of AYR is proposed on the basis of the identification of major intermediate products. These results suggest that Ti/PbO2-Sm2O3 composite electrode is a promising candidate for electrocatalytic degradation of AYR wastewater. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc.

Photooxidation quantum efficiencies (phi(r)) were obtained by determining the overall and reactive rate constants of interaction with the oxidative species, employing the time-resolved O-2((1)Delta(g)) phosphorescence detection method and static-photolysis actinometric method, respectively. The interaction of O-2((1)Delta(g))-tyr derivatives occurs through an intermediate encounter complex with polar character. Ionization of the phenolic OH group of tyr derivatives and the polarity of the solvent favors the overall interaction. Nevertheless, phi(r) values decrease when changing from water to MeCN-water medium, This indicates that the reactive deactivation of the encounter complex, probably an entropy-controlled step, may be affected by solvent polarity in the same way as those processes in which charges are neutralized along the reaction pathway. Photooxidation quantum efficiencies indicate that the contribution to O-2((1)Delta(g)) physical quenching (a second alternative deactivation route for the encountered complex [O-2((1)Delta(g))-tyr derivatives]) increases with the complexity of the peptide, As a result, the selfprotection of the peptidic entity against physical quenching also increases. The information obtained from the fractional consumption mol O-2/mol tyr derivative (in tyr, the di- and tripeptides and the respective methyl ester of tyr and the tripeptide), together with the evolution (either consumption and/or generation) of primary amino groups upon photosensitized irradiation of the same compounds clearly indicates that the photooxidation of di- and tri-tyr peptides proceeds with the breakage of peptidic bonds. As a consequence, in the final balance each tyr unity behaves as an independent photooxidizable target.									31	0	0	0	21	1	31			0031-8655			WOS:000076540100005	9796430

The flow system occurs in Permian and Cretaceous sedimentary rocks and Cenozoic alluvial basin fill. Samples from springs and wells in the study area were analyzed for major ions and hydrogen, oxygen, and strontium isotopes. delta D and delta O-18 values fall close to the global meteoric water line, indicating that these values have not been significantly affected by evaporation or mineral-water reactions. delta O-18 values from samples along the regional flow path are lower by as much as 3 parts per thousand. relative to local recharge values; the distribution of stable isotope values throughout the study area suggests that lower delta O-18 values represent recharge during cooler climatic conditions rather than latitude or attitude effects. Sr-87/Sr-86 values for water samples from along the regional flow path range from 0.7093 to 0.7148, with the highest values at the upgradient end of the flow system. These values are significantly higher than expected for groundwaters dominated by dissolution of Permian and Cretaceous marine carbonates and evaporites. The high Sr-87/Sr-86 values reflect dissolution of minerals of Precambrian and early Pateozoic origin in the crystalline rocks of the Carrizo and Baylor mountains and alluvial. basin fill at the upgradient end of the flow system. Contours of Sr-87/Sr-86 values indicate a zone of high Sr-87/Sr-86 water that corresponds to the regional groundwater flow paths. Mass-balance mixing models and mineral reactions models indicate a three end-member mixing system modified by dissolution of strontium-bearing minerals in the alluvial fill at the upgradient end of the flow system.

J	Sheptovitsky, YG; Brudvig, GW								Catalase-free photosystem II: The O-2-evolving complex does not dismutate hydrogen peroxide								BIOCHEMISTRY				37	15			5052	5059		10.1021/bi972872s				APR 14 1998	1998	A photosystem II (PSII) membrane-associated heme catalase has been identified as a major source of the dari; H2O2-dismutation reaction in PSII membrane samples [Sheptovitsky, Y. G,, and Brudvig, G. W. (1996) Biochemistry 35, 16255-16263]. Based on this finding, a catalase-free PSII membrane sample was prepared by using mild heat treatment to deplete most of the PSII membrane-associated heme catalase followed by inhibition of the residual catalase with 50 mM 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole, a specific heme catalase inhibitor that binds covalently to compound I. After these treatments, the PSII membrane sample exhibited only 0.02% of the original H2O2-dismutation activity when assayed in the presence of 20 mM 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole. This small residual H2O2-dismutation activity is attributed to adventitious metal ions or the non-heme iron in PSII because the activity was still present in a Mn-depleted PSII sample but was completely suppressed by adding 5 mM ferricyanide to the assay buffer; the effect of ferricyanide is attributed to oxidation of H2O2-dismutating cations. Although the H2O2-dismutation activity was completely eliminated by these treatments, the light-induced O-2-evolution activity was retained. A single saturating flash given to catalase-free PSII membranes did not induce any H2O2-dismutation activity. These results demonstrate that the S-1/S-1 and S-2/S-0 cycles of the O-2-evolving complex of PSII do not occur in the presence of H2O2, as proposed by Velthuys, B., and Kok, B. [(1978) Biochim. Biophys. Acta 502, 211-221]. The light-induced O-2-evolution activity in catalase-free PSII was found to be irreversibly impaired by micromolar concentrations of H2O2 Thus, it is possible that the PSII membrane-associated heme catalase plays an important role in protection of the O-2-evolving complex from damage by H2O2.									19	0	2	0	16	0	22			0006-2960			WOS:000073279200003	9548736

The pyrolysis product was examined by chemical analysis, X-ray diffraction and TEM observation. Results were compared with those of Ti free fibre (Nicalon).The amorphous Si-Ti-C-O fibre crystallized to beta-SiC and TiC, with evolution of SiO and CO. TEM observation showed the spherical growth of the crystallites of SiC. The pyrolytic rate of Si-Ti-C-O fibre was larger than that of Si-C-O fibre (Nicalon). While the crystallites of SiC in Nicalon grew markedly during holding at high temperatures after the completion of the pyrolysis, the coarsening of the crystallites in Tyranno was retard.The pyrolytic rate was analyzed by means of Avrami-Erofeev equation. The mean value of the exponent in the rate equation was m = 1.4. The activation energy was 368 kJ/mol. The pyrolysis of Si-Ti-C-O fibre was controlled by the nucleation and growth of SiC crystallites.									13	0	0	0	0	0	13			0021-4876	1880-6880		WOS:A1991FE21400010

Gianfelice, Gianfranco/0000-0003-3195-8599			Onset and propagation of smouldering in pine bark controlled by addition of inert solids								RENEWABLE ENERGY				132				596	614		10.1016/j.renene.2018.08.028				MAR 2019	2019	We investigated the smouldering onset and propagation in a biomass (pine bark) bed to mitigate or control the process. By the addition of sand, the bed porosity has been modified. Sand of different average particle size, in different arrangements and proportions (from 30 to 70%) has been used, modifying the bed porosity (between 0.44 and 0.67). Experiments have been carried out in a flow reactor, with controlled O-2 content in the feed. The packed bed was large enough to allow the development of a reaction front, as expected in large scale applications. Pressure drop measurements revealed as a useful indication to monitor the smouldering onset and the front evolution. The process appears always controlled by the flux of O-2, as expected for smouldering. Properly tuning the bed porosity with inert solids, allows to control the self-heating propagation, in view of its exploitation for low temperature heat production with simultaneous controlled conversion. The addition of sand supports a well-defined reaction front. The inert solid preserves the bed texture when the biomass is progressively consumed and allows to evenly distribute O-2 to the biomass, thus regulating the heat dissipation and keeping the smouldering front confined.

This differential method provides well-defined electrochemical signatures of the various polarization phenomena that occur at Pt microelectrodes and are generally obscured in voltage transients. In combination with a novel in situ coulometric approach, irreversible H-2 and O-2 evolution, Pt dissolution and reduction of dissolved O-2 were detected. Measurements were performed with biphasic, charge-balanced, cathodic-first and anodic-first current pulses at charge densities ranging from 0.07 to 1.41 mC/cm(2) (real surface area) in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) with and without bovine serum albumin (BSA). The extent to which O-2 reduction occurs under the different stimulation conditions was compared in O-2-saturated and deoxygenated PBS. Adsorption of BSA inhibited Pt dissolution as well as Pt oxidation and oxide reduction by blocking reactive sites on the electrode surface. This inhibitory effect promoted the onset of irreversible H-2 and O-2 evolution, which occurred at lower charge densities than those in PBS. Reduction of dissolved O-2 on Pt electrodes accounted for 19-34% of the total injected charge in O-2-saturated PBS, while a contribution of 0.4-12% was estimated for in vivo stimulation. These result may prove important for the interpretation of histological damage induced by neural stimulation and therefore help define safer operational limits.									23	0	0	0	12	0	23			0003-2700	1520-6882		WOS:000290978500009	21545093

Herein, novel two-dimensional(2D) silicate CaCuSi4O10 nanosheet was prepared by high-temperature solid state method using silica derived from palygorskite clay (Pal) and calcium carbonate derived from egg shells, respectively. The photocatalytic nitrogen fixation was performed using CaCuSi4O10 compound as catalyst. The effect of flux content on the ammonia generation rate was investigated. Results demonstrated that the 2D CaCuSi4O10 nanosheet can chemically adsorb and activate N2 due to the high surface area along with abundant oxygen vacancies. The ammonia evolution rate of CaCuSi4O10 can reach up to 60.3 mu molmiddotg-1middoth-1 and 15.6 mu molmiddotg-1middoth-1 under si-mulated solar light and near infrared (NIR) light irradiation, respectively. The enhanced photocatalytic nitrogen fixation can be ascribed to the up-conversion capability of CaCuSi4O10, which converts NIR into visible and UV light improving the utilization efficiency of full solar spectrum. Current study may offer a promising strategy for cost-effective photocatalytic nitrogen fixation under full spectrum. (C) 2022 Elsevier B.V.

However, fast recombination of excitons in bulk electrode materials is still the major challenge for current PEC photoelectrodes deployment. Introducing effective electric field across the interface by ferroelectric polarization holds great promise for anisotropic charge separation. Herein, we present a nano-thick transparent ferroelectric P(VDF-TrFE) film on semiconducting TiO2 as a model ferroelectric-PEC hybrid. The positively polarizing of TiO2/P(VDF-TrFE) effectively enhance the photocurrent density 186% and 570% compared to that of non-polarized and negatively polarized cases. Such improvement is ascribed to the separation of photogenerated carriers associated with the work function variations of the P(VDF-TrFE) film under polarization, inducing the band re-alignment at the TiO2/P(VDF-TrFE) interface. This concept provides a novel approach for optimizing the catalytic characteristics of TiO2 and can be extended to other transparent and flexible systems.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000608533400001

In the present work we demonstrate the application of a PTFE hydrophobic network and Ag nanowires as oxygen evolution electrocatalyst in the metal foam based gas diffusion electrodes. A novel cell production method, based on tape casting and hot pressing, was developed which allows to increase the cell size from lab scale (1 cm(2)) to areas of 25 cm(2) or larger. The thickness of the electrolyte matrix could be adjusted to only 200 mu m, achieving a serial resistance and total area specific resistance of only 60 m Omega cm(2) and 150 m Omega cm(2), respectively, at 200 degrees C and 20 bar, yielding a record high current density of 3.75 A cm(-2) at a cell voltage of 1.75 V. Encouraging long-term stability was obtained over 400 h of continuous electrolysis. This novel cell concept promises more than a 10-fold improvement in power density, compared to conventional alkaline electrolysis cells, and thereby equivalent reduction in stack size and cost.

Herein, TiO2 nanosheets (NSs) are in situ grown on highly conductive Ti3C2 MXene and then MoS2 NSs are deposited on the (101) facets of TiO2 NSs with mainly exposed high-active (001) facets through a two-step hydrothermal method. And a unique 2D-2D-2D structure of Ti3C2@TiO2@MoS2 composite is achieved. With an optimized MoS2 loading amounts (15 wt%), the Ti3C2@TiO2@MoS2 composite shows a remarkable enhancement in the photocatalytic H-2 evolution reaction compared with Ti3C2@TiO2 composite and TiO2 NS. It also shows good stability under the reaction condition. This arises from: (i) the in situ growth of TiO2 NSs construct strong interfacial contact with excellent electronic conductivity of Ti3C2, which facilitates the separation of carriers; (ii) the coexposed (101) and (001) facets can form a surface heterojunction within single TiO2 NS, which is beneficial for the transfer and separation of charge carriers; and (iii) the MoS2 NSs are deposited on the electrons-rich (101) facets of TiO2 NSs, which not only effectively reduces the charge carriers recombination rate by capturing photoelectrons, but also makes TiO2 NSs expose more highly active (001) facets to afford high-efficiency photogeneration of electron-hole pairs.									265	23	0	0	26	0	271			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000460495400002

While advances were made regarding their implementation in practical devices, debate exists regarding the physical origin for the delayed water reduction occurring at the electrode/electrolyte interface. Evidently, one difficulty resides in our lack of knowledge regarding ion activity arising from this novel class of electrolytes, which is necessary to estimate the Nernst potential of associated redox reactions, such as Li+ intercalation or the hydrogen evolution reaction. In this work, we first measured the potential shift of electrodes selective to Li+, H+, or Zn2+ ions from diluted to highly concentrated regimes in LiCl or LiTFSI solutions. Observing similar shifts for these different cations and environments, we establish that shifts in redox potentials from diluted to highly concentrated regimes originate in large from an increased junction potential, which is dependent on the ion activity coefficients that increase with the concentration. While our study shows that single ion activity coefficients, unlike mean ion activity coefficients, cannot be captured by any electrochemical means, we demonstrate that the proton concentration increases by one to two orders of magnitude from 1 to 15-20 mol kg(-1) solutions. Combined with the increased activity coefficients, this phenomenon increases the activity of protons and thus increases the pH of highly concentrated solutions which appears acidic.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			0021-9606	1089-7690		WOS:000683519500005	34391353

The formation of H-2 occurs photocatalytically at the surface of CoPc in the organo-bilayer, along with the reduction of O-2 by a reducing power generated at PTCBI. The mechanism to illustrate the H-2-formation from AB by the organo-photocatalyst may be different from that of the conventional photocatalysis by inorganic semiconductors. To further understand the mechanism of H-2-formation, photoelectrochemistry is further investigated using the PTCBI/CoPc bilayer as a photoanode. Considering the resulting faradaic efficiency for H-2-formation, at least two possible equations have to be suggested: BH3OH- (intermediate) + 3OH(-) -> BO2- + 3/2H(2) + 2H(2)O + 3e(-) and BH3OH- (intermediate) + 2OH(-) -> BO2- + 2H(2) + H2O + 2e(-).									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			1572-6657	1873-2569		WOS:000443664700039

(1976) to organize the network of complex metabolic reactions occurring in the living cell, employing directed signal how diagram in which the enzyme reaction coefficient was defined as the metabolic transfer coefficient. Using this concept, a metabolic reaction between substrate A and product B could be regarded as a signal transmittance from A to B. A very simple set of linear equations was then derived to analyze the flow directions of the carbon fluxes and the degree of activation of certain metabolic pathways within a recombinant yeast, in which the specific consumption rate of galactose, the specific rate of change of ethanol and the specific uptake rate of oxygen constituted the three input nodes of the metabolic signal transfer system. The output nodes were the specific growth rate of the cells, the specific production rate of the recombinant protein and the specific evolution rate of carbon dioxide. In this may, the effect of the culture conditions on cell growth and recombinant protein production under control of the GAL10 promoter could be characterized in terms of the metabolic pathways based on observable variables such as the cell and product concentrations, and the carbon dioxide and oxygen in the exhaust gas. This approach was successfully applied to an analysis of the metabolic pathways occurring in the fed-batch cultivation of a recombinant yeast where galactose served as both the carbon source for cell growth and as an inducer for expression of the recombinant gene. The expression period was classified into three phases-named the switch, expression, and stationary phases-on the basis of calculations using signal flow equations. In the switch phase, biomaterials for cell growth were found to be synthesized through the TCA cycle and UR loop, and less galactose entered the induction pathway. In the stationary phase, on the other hand, the formation of biomaterials for cell growth occurred mainly through the PP and EMP pathways and the TCA cycle. The degree of activation of the induction pathway was reduced in this phase.

This adaptation requires both anticipation of the changing conditions, which is accomplished by daily rhythmicity of gene expression brought about by the circadian clock, and reaction to sudden illumination.Besides perception of the light signal, also integration of this signal with other environmental cues, most importantly nutrient availability, necessitates light-dependent regulation of signal transduction pathways and metabolic pathways. An influence of light and/or the circadian clock is known for the cAMP pathway, hetero-trimeric G-protein signaling, mitogen-activated protein kinases, two-component phosphorelays, and Ca2+ signaling. Moreover, also the target of rapamycin signaling pathway and reactive oxygen species as signal transducing elements are assumed to be connected to the light-response pathway. The interplay of the light-response pathway with signaling cascades results in light-dependent regulation of primary and secondary metabolism, morphology, development, biocontrol activity, and virulence. The frequent use of fungi in biotechnology as well as analysis of fungi in the artificial environment of a laboratory therefore requires careful consideration of still operative evolutionary heritage of these organisms.This review summarizes the diverse effects of light on fungi and the mechanisms they apply to deal both with the information content and with the harmful properties of light. Additionally, the implications of the reaction of fungi to light in a laboratory environment for experimental work and industrial applications are discussed.									15	0	0	0	12	0	16			0065-2164		978-0-12-387048-3	WOS:000295820100002	21924971

Simultaneously, a H-2 production rate of 12 mol h(-1) m(-2) was obtained with a DFF yield of 13.8% with >99% selectivity after 6 h under visible light. The selectivity of DFF was maintained >99% even after longer runs (48 h) with an improved DFF yield of 38.4% and H-2 production rate of 36 mol h(-1) m(-2). In addition, a H-2 production rate of 6.2 mol h(-1) m(-2) with 0.15 light-to-fuel efficiency (LFE) and DFF (7.2% yield) were obtained under natural sunlight after 6 h. Thus, this study describes an effective way to utilize both photogenerated electrons and holes for simultaneous H-2 production by water splitting and biomass derived HMF oxidation to DFF, respectively, under natural sunlight.									51	5	0	0	7	0	52			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000463824300055

While the layered assembly of PSI generates an anodic photocurrent only in the presence of a sacrificial electron donor system, such as dichlorophenol indophenol (DCPIP)/ascorbate, the PSII-modified electrode leads, upon irradiation, to the formation of an anodic photocurrent (while evolving oxygen), in the absence of any sacrificial component. The photocurrent is generated by transferring the electrons from the PSII units to the PBV2+ redox polymer. The charge-separated species allow, then, the injection of the electrons to the electrode, with the concomitant evolution of O-2. A layered assembly, consisting of a PSI layer attached to a layer of PSII by the redox polymer PBV2+, leads to an anodic photocurrent that is 2-fold higher, as compared to the anodic photocurrent generated by a PSII-modified electrode. This observation is attributed to an enhanced charge separation in the two-photosystem assembly. By the further nano-engineering of the two photosystems on the electrode using two different redox polymers, vectorial electron transfer to the electrode is demonstrated, resulting in a ca. 6-fold enhancement in the photocurrent. The reversed bi-layer assembly, consisting of a PSII layer linked to a layer of PSI by the PBV2+ redox polymer, yields, upon irradiation, an inefficient cathodic current. This observation is attributed to a mixture of photoinduced electron transfer reactions of opposing effects on the photocurrent directions in the two-photosystem assembly.									79	6	0	0	22	0	81			1613-6810	1613-6829		WOS:000327816500017	23606348

These model electrodes shall resemble new composite electrodes produced by coldspraying and currently being tested for Zn electrowinning. CAFM showed a very uneven distribution of the current path through the matrix electrode with the highest currents measured at the MnO2/Pb domain boundary. SECM images in the substrate-generation/tip-collection mode in vertical and horizontal planes could show spatial concentration distribution of H+, O-2 and H2O2 that could be evaluated qualitatively despite interfering turbulent convection due to raising gas bubbles. There is a concentration overvoltage due to deviations of the H+ and O-2 concentration close to the surface from the bulk value. It amounts to about 40-50 mV for both compounds. H2O2 is formed as an intermediate and is consumed at the MnO2 catalyst particles.									13	2	0	0	0	0	15			0021-891X	1572-8838		WOS:000274686700013

Therefore, choosing a photoanode semiconductor material to enhance the PEC efficiency is a critical problem. Here, we assemble a unique Co3O4@(delta-)MnO2 setaria-viridislike heterostructure employing a two-step hydrothermal method. To maximize PEC degradation efficiency, coupling Co3O4 with an appropriate amount of MnO2 achieves Co3O4@MnO2-0.05, resulting in high oxygen evolution potential, fast carrier transfer, low resistance, electron-deficient surface, and high photo-response current. Those properties endow Co3O4@MnO2-0.05 as a promising candidate for practice application of dye degradation, with a degradation rate of 94.8 % and long-term durability (-12000 s) under 1.0 mol.L-1 H2SO4 condition at a current density of 250 mA.cm(-2) for blue KN-R degradation. Remarkably, the superior PEC degradation efficiency of Co3O4@MnO2-0.05 outperformed that of Co3O4-based and MnO2-based catalysts due to the dominant role of center dot O-2(-) and h(+) radical during degradation experiments.									2	0	0	0	1	0	2			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000723693600008

In this research, the evolution of corrosion in an ISO 2379 cast Al alloy was studied in an antifreeze radiator coolant under heat-rejecting conditions. Extensive analyses of microstructures and corroded surfaces were carried out using an optical microscope, scanning electron microscope equipped with energy dispersive spectroscopy and X-ray diffractometer. Intergranular cavitation corrosion was observed to occur at interfaces between alpha-Al matrix and intermetallics (Al(2)Cu and Al(5)FeSi) or to a less degree at interfaces between alpha-Al matrix and Si phase. The large area fraction of the cathodic phases (Al(2)Cu, Al(5)FeSi and Si) led to the galvanic coupling between them and the adjacent anodic alpha-Al matrix. The heat-rejecting condition in antifreeze radiator coolant was favourable condition to cavitation process while severe crevice corrosion was predominant at oxygen-depleted regions in the heat-transfer corrosion cell.									2	2	0	0	0	0	4			0947-5117			WOS:000262293400006

The framework of the density functional theory was applied in a generalized gradient approximation together with the hybrid functional method. It is revealed that lithium atoms intercalate in this material in a maximum concentration of one Li atom per formula unit forming LiNb2O2F3. Moreover, octahedral positions in between the layers of Nb-O-F appear as the Li preferred occupancy resulting in a structural volume expansion of only 5%. Electronic structure evolution with the insertion of lithium displays a transformation from semi-conductor to metal when half of the lithium atoms are added. This transformation occurs due to a symmetry break induced by the transition from the + 8 to + 7 oxidation state of half of the Nb2 dimers. Then, after full lithiation the symmetry is recovered and the material becomes a semiconductor again with a band gap amounting to 1 eV. The evaluated average deintercalation potential reaches 1.29 V vs. Li/Li+ with activation energy for lithium ion migration of 0.79 eV. The computed low potential of the redox reaction Nb-2(8+) to Nb-2(7+) includes niobium oxyfluoride in the map of possible materials for the anode application of Li-ion batteries.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1463-9076	1463-9084		WOS:000369508100020	26751421

However, many reported SACs are susceptible to Ostwald ripening process in high temperature environment or long-term catalytic application, which will cause sintering and deactivation. This is due to the weak interaction between the metal atom and supports. The regeneration and recycling of deactivated catalysts will greatly increase the time and economic cost of industrial production. Therefore, it is necessary to develop SACs with excellent thermal stability to meet the industrial demands. Here, we discuss the fundamental comprehension of the stability of thermally stable SACs obtained from different synthesis methods. The influences of the speciation of metal centers and coordination environments on thermal stability are summarized. The importance of using novel in situ and operando characterizations to reveal dynamic structural evolution under synthesis and reaction conditions and to identify active sites of thermally stable SACs is highlighted. The mechanistic understanding of the unique role of thermally stable SACs in thermocatalytic application is also discussed. At last, a brief perspective on the remaining challenges and future directions of thermally stable SACs is presented. (c) 2022, Dalian Institute of Chemical Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences.

In this work, we accommodated the discharge product in macro-scale voids of a carbon-framed architecture with meso-dimensional channels on the carbon frame and open holes connecting the neighboring voids. More importantly, we found that a specific dimension of the voids guaranteed high capacity and cycling durability of LOBs. The best LOB performances were achieved by employing the carbon-framed architecture having voids of 0.8 mu m size as the cathode of the LOB when compared with the cathodes having voids of 0.3 and 1.4 mu m size. The optimized void size of 0.8 mu m allowed only a monolithic integrity of lithium peroxide deposit within a void during discharging. The deposit was grown to be a yarn ball-looking sphere exactly fitting the shape and size of the void. The good electric contact allowed the discharge product to be completely decomposed during charging. On the other hand, the void space was not fully utilized due to the mass transfer pathway blockage at the sub-optimized 0.3 mu m and the formation of multiple deposit integrities within a void at the sub-optimized 1.4 mu m. Consequently, the critical void dimension at 0.8 mu m was superior to other dimensions in terms of the void space utilization efficiency and the lithium peroxide decomposition efficiency, disallowing empty space and side reactions during discharging.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000736114200001	34932302

Isolation and characterization of oxygen-evolving photosystem II particles and photosystem II core complex from the filamentous cyanobacterium Spirulina platensis								PHOTOSYNTHETICA				51	4			517	530		10.1007/s11099-013-0051-0				DEC 2013	2013	Photosystem (PS) II particles retaining a high rate of O-2 evolution were isolated from the mesophilic filamentous cyanobacterium, Spirulina platensis. To achieve high production of PSII complexes in the cells, irradiance from halogen incandescent lamps was used. Disruption of cells by vibration of glass beads proved to be the most suitable procedure for isolation of thylakoid membranes. The selectivity of detergents for PSII particle preparation rose in the order of Triton X-100 < decyl-beta-D-glucopyranoside < dodecyldimethyl-aminooxide < n-heptyl-beta-D-thioglucoside < N-dodecyl-N,N-dimethylammonio-3-propane sulphonate < n-octyl-beta-thioglycoside < octylglucoside < n-dodecyl-beta-D-maltoside. The last four detergents yielded extracts, from which pure PSII particles not contaminated by PSI complexes could be obtained by sucrose-gradient centrifugation (20-45%) at the 43% sucrose level. We assumed both the acceptor and donor sides of the isolated n-dodecyl-beta-D-maltoside (DM) particles to be intact due to high oxygen production by DM particles [1,500 meq(e(-)) mol(-1) (Chl) s(-1)] achieved in the presence of all artificial acceptors tested. The PSII particle fraction from the sucrose gradient was used with immobilized metal (Cu2+) affinity chromatography (IMAC) for the preparation of the PSII core complex. By washing the column with a MES buffer containing MgCl2 and CaCl2, the phycobiliproteins were stripped off. The PSII core complex was eluted in a buffer containing 1% DM, mannitol, MgCl2, NaCl, CaCl2, and E >-aminocaproic acid. SDS-PAGE of the core complex provided pure bands of D1 and D2 proteins and PsbO protein from thylakoid membrane, which were used to raise polyclonal antibodies in rabbits. These antibodies recognized D1 and D2 not only as monomers of 31 and 32 kDa proteins, but also as heterodimers of D1, D2 corresponding to the band of 66 kDa on SDS-PAGE. This was in contrast to antibodies of synthetic determinants, which reacted only with the monomers of D1 and D2 proteins. These negative reactions against heterodimers of D1, D2 supported the hypothesis that dimeric forms of PSII reaction centre proteins have a C-terminal sequence sterically protected against a reaction with specific antibodies.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0300-3604	1573-9058		WOS:000327507500006

Some time ago such compounds were dubbed "just a dream of synthetic chemists", what was a perfect reflection of on the one hand, high promise, and, on the other hand, experimental difficulties faced with the 2D polymers. Despite a long history of PPCs (since late 1950s), it was shown recently that in many works the reaction products were mis-interpreted, and the studied compounds should be assigned to a low degree of the polymerization. Recent years, the discovery of graphene has inspired a new wave of interest to PPCs. From the graphene point of view, the questions are: whether we can make other graphene-like materials with modified properties? Can we use metal atoms to tune its electronic properties? Can we make a magnetic 2D material? From the polymer chemistry point of view, the major problem is why the common synthetic approaches and characterization techniques didn't work for this polymer as expected? And how to identify the reaction products? This review covers evolution of the synthetic approaches, establishment of the reliable characterization techniques, as well as the promising applications of 2D PPCs and the "new dreams" in science and technology of these materials.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			1998-9539			WOS:000503872500002

In spite of the very small cross section of this neutron-magic nucleus and a number of additional experimental complications, the stellar value of [sigma v]/v(T) = 226 +/- 10 mu b could be reliably determined. Because of this small cross section, 34S acts as a bottleneck for the reaction flow to S-36. Consequently, the suggested interpretation of the 36S abundance as a neutron monitor for the s-process in massive stars must be ruled out. This implies, however, that the origin of 36S remains an open problem.									24	0	0	0	0	0	24			0004-637X			WOS:000084941100049

Herein, we demonstrate novel black phosphorus quantum dots (BPQDs) with significant light absorbability up to the near-infrared region (NIR) to sensitize the etched BiVO4 photoanode (E-BiVO4) for a two-photon absorption tandem photoanode. A subsequent TiO2 overlayer (OL) significantly improves the stability of the E-BiVO4/BPQDs and eliminates the surface trap state to enhance charge separation. Finally, an oxygen evolution catalyst (OEC), NiOOH, loaded on E-BiVO4/BPQDs/OL further improves the water oxidation kinetics. The rationally designed E-BiVO4/BPQDs/OL-OEC with multiple components, each with definite functions, achieves a photocurrent density of 6.2 mA cm(-2) at 1.23 V vs. reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) under AM 1.5 illumination, offering a high-end standard approach for achieving efficient solar-to-fuel conversion devices by combining a photosensitizer and passivation layer.									11	0	0	0	0	0	11			1754-5692	1754-5706		WOS:000738828200001

X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS) and X-ray adsorption fine structure (XAFS) data demonstrate that these sub-nanometric Pt clusters are in a highly oxidized state and possess two localized Pt-O coordination structures. The Pt-O bonds between the oxidized Pt clusters and the TiO2 give rise to a strong metal-support interaction (SMSI). When applied to the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), this catalyst exhibits significantly enhanced catalytic activity (increased by a factor of up to 8.4) and enhanced stability compared with the state-of-the-art commercial Pt/C catalysts. Particularly, the additional XPS and XAFS characterizations of the catalyst after long-term electrolysis demonstrate the absence of metallic Pt species, confirming that the catalytic active site comes from the oxidized Pt clusters rather than from the the metallic Pt species. This improved performance is considered to be induced by the unique electronic structure of the oxidized Pt clusters and by the SMSI. Based on the results of density functional theory calculations, the 5d orbital of the oxidized Pt cluster atoms appears to hybridize with the H 1s orbital to form weak Pt-H valence bonds, leading to a DG (relative free energy) value of approximately zero eV for H* absorption. This effect explains the mechanism responsible for the excellent catalytic activity of these oxidized Pt clusters for the HER. This work therefore provides important insights into the role of oxidized Pt clusters as an HER electrocatalyst. The evident stabilization of the oxidized Pt clusters on TiO2 supports via the charge-transfer mechanism provides a useful approach for improving the durability of electrocatalysts that may be applicable to other noble metal/support systems.									164	13	0	0	9	0	165			1754-5692	1754-5706		WOS:000414774500018

The TEM results signified that BiOI possess a tetragonal crystal structure with exposed {001} facets, which is favorable to aggrandize the visible-light photocatalytic phenomenon. The photocatalytic property of BiOI and the commercial Bi2O3 was investigated by the photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting process under visible light irradiation. The BiOI produces a photocurrent of 6.56 mu A cm(-2) (1.23 V vs. reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE)) for PEC water oxidation at pH 6.6, which is partly attributed to the strong visible light absorbance along a or b direction. The experimental outcome of the ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) of BiOI exhibited that the holes from the valence band of BiOI can oxidize the water to accomplish an oxygen evolution.

Moreover, the redox potential values of their primary electron donors are identical (similar to 0.5 V). In our earlier reports [Khorobrykh et al. (2008) Phylos. Trans. R. Soc. B., 363, 1245-1251; Terentyev et al. (2011) Biochemistry (Moscow., 76, 1360-1366; Khorobrykh et al. (2018) ChemBioChem, 14, 1725-1731], we have demonstrated redox interaction of low-potential Mn2+-bicarbonate complexes with bRCs, which might have been one of the first steps in the evolutionary origin of Mn-cluster of the photosystem II water-oxidizing complex that occurred in the Archean (over 3 billion years ago). In this study, we investigated redox interactions between Mn2+-bicarbonate complexes and PSI. Such interactions were almost absent in the original PSI preparations and emerged only in preoxidized PSI preparations containing similar to 50% oxidized RCs. The interaction between Mn2+-bicarbonate complexes and PSI required increased Mn2+ concentrations, while its dependence on the HCO3- concentration indicated involvement of electroneutral low-potential [Mn(HCO3)(2)] complex in the process. Analysis of the PSI crystal structure revealed steric hindrances on the RC donor side, which could block the redox interaction between Mn2+-bicarbonate complexes and oxidized primary electron donor. Comparison of structures of RCs from the PSI and ancient RCs from heliobacteria belonging to the same type of RCs suggested that such hindrances should be absent in the primitive PSI in the Archean and allowed to explain their evolutionary origin as a consequence of PSI RCs into the united electron transport chain (ETC) of the photosynthetic membrane that was accompanied by the evolutionary loss of PSI capacity for the redox interaction with Mn2+-bicarbonate complexes.									0	0	0	0	1	0	1			0006-2979	1608-3040		WOS:000538039600007	32586233

NiOx-loaded Sm2InTaO7 showed high photocatalytic activities for H-2 evolution from pure water under visible light irradiation (lambda.>400nm). Changes in the photocatalytic activity with the calcination temperature of Sm2InTaO7 and the amount of NiOx loaded indicated that the combination of highly crystallized Sm2InTaO7 and a high dispersion of NiOx particles led to high photocatalytic activity. The high photocatalytic performance of NiOx-loaded Sm2InTaO7 supported the existing view that the photocatalytic activity correlated with the lattice distortion. Density functional theory calculation indicated that strong dispersion from the hybridized In 5s 5p orbitals at the bottom of the conduction band Was responsible for the high activity of photocatalyst Sm2InTaO7.

We have introduced five site-directed mutations in the D2 protein in the vicinity of Tyr(D) to analyze the consequences of the mutations on spectral and functional properties of Tyr(D)(ox). Characterization of three mutants, P161A and P161L (Pro161 changed to Ala and Leu, respectively) and Q164L (Gln164 mutated to Leu), is emphasized. Of these three mutants, only P161L is an obligate photoheterotroph; it is capable of oxygen evolution, but is photoinactivated rapidly. The D2 protein of this mutant migrates slower on a SDS-polyacrylamide gel. The EPR spectrum of Tyr(D)(ox) is modified in the three mutants. The EPR spectra of Tyr(D)(ox) in wild type and the mutants were characterized in detail by comparison of EPR spectra of thylakoids from cells grown in the presence and absence of tyrosine that was deuterated in specific positions. The experimentally obtained EPR spectra of wild type, P161A, and Q164L could be simulated satisfactorily using current theoretical models, The angle between one of the hydrogens on the P-methylene carbon and the 2p(z) orbital at C-1 of the tyrosine ring was found to change slightly but significantly as a function of the mutations (52 degrees in wild type, 50 degrees in P161A, and 48 degrees in Q164L). The overall electronic structure of Tyr(D)(ox) is quite unaffected; only minor redistribution of the unpaired electron spin is observed between the wild type and the mutated systems. In all three strains, the spin density is in the range from 0.34-0.38 at carbon atom C-1, -0.08 at C-2 and C-6, and 0.26-0.29 at C-4 and the oxygen. In the P161L mutant a dark-stable, wide radical is observed with an intermediate g value (g = 2.0042). This EPR spectrum is also sensitive to tyrosine deuteration. However, the EPR spectrum is not easily understood in terms of a single Tyr radical and could not be simulated adequately. Possible reasons for this are discussed. Nonetheless, the results presented here imply the sensitivity of EPR spectroscopy to monitor changes in geometry and spin distribution in radicals as a function of alterations in their immediate protein environment.									24	0	0	0	11	0	24			0006-2960			WOS:A1994PK34000017	7918398

We have assessed the NO-induced changes by using sodium nitroprusside (SNP, a NO donor) in photosynthetic components in protoplasts of pea (Pisum sativum) by measuring chlorophyll (Chl) a fluorescence induction kinetics. On exposure to SNP during preillumination, their photochemical activities were severely affected. There was a decrease of 40% in O-2 evolution by 5 min and complete inhibition by 20 min. The patterns of photosynthesis in absence of NO did not vary much over 20 min. Chl a fluorescence transient analysis and the energy pipeline models demonstrated that NO decreased the rates and efficiency of photochemical reactions. Presence of NO lowered the photosynthetic performance index and increased the dissipation per reaction centre with the time. Our results suggest that NO inactivates the PSII by targeting both the donor and acceptor sides of PSII.									1	0	0	0	1	0	1			0300-3604	1573-9058		WOS:000524480200027

However, nearly all biogenic carbonates undergo post-mortem diagenetic alteration to variable degrees. Diagenetic features are essentially caused by complex fluid-solid interaction including recrystallization and neomorphosis of shell architecture and related geochemical resetting. A common conception is that a given primary shell texture is replaced by a secondary fabric via micro-scale dissolution-reprecipitation reactions that may reach geochemical and/or isotopic equilibrium with the diagenetic fluid. Here we document that the process of petrographic and geochemical alteration of a biogenic carbonate archive progresses stepwise, and the re-equilibration processes can be separated in space and time. More specifically, attached and bound aqueous fluids within the shell organic matter and fluid inclusions likely play a crucial role in the early stages of alteration within a relatively rock-buffered system. Degradation of organics was observed via decreased sulfur concentration and decreased fluorescence. In this early stage of alteration, the conversion of micro-scale aragonite biominerals to metastable diagenetic calcite (meso)crystals is documented by RAMAN spectroscopy, electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD), and a decrease in strontium concentrations. Further stabilization to larger, neomorphosed calcite crystals resulted from re-equilibration with external fluids and was evidenced by EBSD, oxygen isotope data, and further reduction of strontium. Spatial chemical and isotope data were used to decipher the impact of fluid availability and transfer behavior, i.e. carbonate-buffered versus diagenetic-fluid buffered, and isotope and element exchange behavior, and analyzed in context to textural alteration features. These data suggest that during diagenesis, the evolution to more sustainable (diagenetically induced) fabrics is accompanied by individual reaction steps traced by elemental and isotopic signatures. Kinetics, and thus degree of diagenetic alteration of biominerals at a given exposure to physicochemical alteration conditions is initially strongly controlled by the micro- to nano-scale internal architecture governing the availability and transfer of aqueous fluids. Results shown here have significance for those concerned with biogenic carbonate archives and have wider implications for a mechanistic understanding of carbonate diagenesis. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

The whole reaction is divided into three steps: (1) formation of a-hydroxy cyclohexanone by dehydrogenation of cyclohexanediol, (2) formation of 1,2-cyclohexanedione by dehydrogenation of alpha-hydroxy cyclohexanone, and (3) formation of adipic anhydride by oxygenation of cyclohexanedione. In each step the two-electron oxidation is performed by (RuO)-O-IV(tpa) active species, which is reduced to bis-aqua Ru-II(tpa) complex. The Ru-II complex is reactivated using Ce(IV) and water as an oxygen source. There are two different pathways of the first two steps of the conversion depending on whether the direct H-atom abstraction occurs on a C H bond or on its adjacent oxygen O-H. In the first step, the C-H (O-H) bond dissociation occurs in TS1 (TS2-1) with an activation barrier of 21.4 (21.6) kcal/mol, which is followed by abstraction of another hydrogen pathways. The second process also bifurcates into two reaction pathways. TS3 (TS4 1) is leading to dissociation of the C-H (O-H) bond, and the activation barrier of TS3 (TS4-1) is 20.2 (20.7) kcal/mol. In the third step, oxo ligand attack on the carbonyl carbon and hydrogen migration from the water ligand occur via TS5 with an activation barrier of 17.4 kcal/mol leading to a stable tetrahedral intermediate in a triplet state. However, the slightly higher energy singlet state of this tetrahedral intermediate is unstable; therefore, a spin crossover spontaneously transforms the tetrahedral intermediate into a dione complex by a hydrogen rebound and a C C bond cleavage. Kinetic isotope effects (k(H)/k(D)) for the electronic processes of the C H bond dissociations calculated to be 4.9-7.4 at 300 K are in good agreement with experiment values of 2.8-9.0.									11	0	0	0	0	0	11			0020-1669	1520-510X		WOS:000292010000041	21634386

We assume that a massive carbon-oxygen (CO) white dwarf (WD) accretes matter coming from a companion star, making it spin at the critical rate. We assume uniform rotation due to magnetic field coupling. The carbon ignition mass for non-rotating WDs is M-ig(NR) approximate to 1.38 M-circle dot, while for the case of uniformly rotating WDs it is a few percent larger (M-ig(R) approximate to 1.43 M-circle dot). When accretion rate decreases, the WD begins to lose angular momentum, shrinks, and spins up; however, it does not overflow its critical rotation rate, avoiding mass shedding. Thus, angular momentum losses can lead the CO WD interior to compression and carbon ignition, which would induce an SN Ia. The delay, largely due to the angular momentum losses timescale, may be large enough to allow the companion star to evolve to a He WD, becoming undetectable at the moment of explosion. This scenario supports the occurrence of delayed SNe Ia if the final CO WD mass is 1.38 M-circle dot < M < 1.43 M-circle dot. We also find that if the delay is longer than similar to 3 Gyr, the WD would become too cold to explode, rather undergoing collapse.									25	2	0	0	0	0	25			2041-8205	2041-8213		WOS:000359321900006

Heynh. cv. Landsberg erecta. Plants grown under four light regimes showed differences in their development, morphology, photosynthetic performance and in the composition of the photosynthetic apparatus. Plants grown under high light showed higher maximum rates of oxygen evolution and lower levels of light-harvesting complexes than their low light-grown counterparts; plants transferred to low light showed rapid changes in maximum photosynthetic rate and chlorophyll-alb ratio as they became acclimated to the new environment. In contrast, plants grown under lights of differing spectral quality showed significant differences in the ratio of photosystem II to photosystem I. These changes are consistent with a model in which photosynthetic metabolism provides signals which regulate the composition of the thylakoid membrane.									132	5	0	0	122	0	136			0032-0935	1432-2048		WOS:A1994PY37700012

Based on the transcriptome and the genome of the rubber tree, 16 genes encoding the GASA proteins were identified in Hevea brasiliensis. The phylogenetic relationship of the 16 GASA proteins of H. brasiliensis was analyzed by comparing with that of Arabidopsis thaliana and Oryza sativa. Transcriptional assay showed that the GASA genes were regulated by the fungal pathogens Colletotrichum gloeosporioides. Transient expression in Nicotiana benthamiana revealed that the GASA genes were involved in generating reactive oxygen species, indicating their roles in plant innate immunity. In addition, the quantitative real-time PCR assays suggested that the GASA genes were regulated by plant hormone in complex ways. Taken together, the present study provides the comprehensive analysis and reveals putative roles of GASA genes in fungal pathogen resistance in H. brasiliensis.									11	0	0	0	8	0	11			1614-2942	1614-2950		WOS:000433261600001		
J	Ferrari, CKB								Free radicals, lipid peroxidation and antioxidants in apoptosis: implications in cancer, cardiovascular and neurological diseases								BIOLOGIA				55	6			581	590						DEC 2000	2000	Reactive oxygen species (ROS) and free radicals promote redox reactions, altering biomolecules and damaging cell components. ROS can react directly with lipids, proteins, enzymes and DNA, altering them. ROS induce lipid peroxidation (LO), yielding peroxides, alcohols, aldehydes, ketones and cholesterol oxides (COs), most remarkably toxic, all of them present in animal cells and foods. It has been acknowledged that COs and oxidized LDL can provoke cell death of blood vessel macrophages, resulting in atherosclerotic plaque formation. COs are also cytotoxic to lymphocytes. During the evolution of living organisms, apoptosis, a "new" type of cell death, was conserved as a genetic programming of cellular suicide, triggered when cells were affected by small injuries to maintain the genome stability and save tissue integrity against damage. Oxidative stress can modify cell signaling pathways, inducing the expression of cell death genes and triggering enzymatic degradation of proteins, activating apoptosis. The antioxidant control of apoptosis in vital tissues (neuronal, cardiac, hepatic) should consider signaling mechanisms and gene expression triggered by ROS stimulation.									35	1	1	0	22	1	38			0006-3088	1336-9563		WOS:000166652800001

Herein, a WO3 thin layer is deposited on the p-Si substrate by pulsed laser deposition (PLD), acting as a photocathode for PEC hydrogen generation. Compared to bare p-Si, the single-junctional p-Si/WO3 photoelectrodes exhibit excellent and stable PEC performances with significantly increased cathodic photocurrent density and exceptional anodic shift in onset potential for water reduction. It is revealed that the WO3 layer could reduce the charge transfer resistance across the electrode/electrolyte interface by eliminating the effect of Fermi level pinning on the surface of p-Si. More importantly, by varying the oxygen pressures during PLD, the collaborative modulation of W-O bond covalency and WO6 octahedral structure symmetry contributes to the promoted charge carrier transport and separation. Meanwhile, a large band bending at the p-Si/WO3 junction, induced by the optimized O vacancy contents in WO3, could provide a photovoltage as high as similar to 500 mV to efficiently drive charge transfer to overcome the water reduction overpotential. Synergistically, by manipulating W-O local atomic structures in the deposited WO3 layer, a great improvement in PEC performance could be achieved over the single-junctional p-Si/WO3 photocathodes for solar hydrogen generation.									5	0	0	0	1	0	5			1998-0124	1998-0000		WOS:000594250700001

Photocatalytic semiconductor materials play a major role in PECs, and their overall efficiency is usually limited by short carrier diffusion length because of structural defects, poor light absorptivity, and sluggish kinetics of photoelectrochemical reactions at the semiconductor electrode. Synthesis of high quality defect-free semiconductor materials using high temperature deposition techniques generally yield films with good adhesion to substrates while improving charge carrier transport and hence the overall efficiency of a PEC. A direct liquid injection chemical vapor deposition (DLI-CVD) technique has been utilized to synthesize monoclinic clinobisvanite phase bismuth vanadate (BiVO4) films for photocatalytic water oxidation. The technique yields dense high quality epitaxial and polycrystalline BiVO4 films on Yttria stabilized zirconia (YSZ) and Fluorine doped tin oxide (FTO) substrates, respectively, at growth temperature in the range of 500-550 degrees C. The photo electrochemical characteristics of the films grown on FTO have been studied and a photocurrent value of 2.1 mA/cm(2) at 1.23 V vs Normal hydrogen electrode (NHE) (0.5 V vs. Ag/AgCl), with onset potential values as low as 0.23 V vs. NHE (-0.5 V vs. Ag/AgC1), are obtained despite the low porosity of the films. The PEC performance is further improved by synthesizing BiVO4 directly on top of a tungsten oxide interlayer and modifying its surface with FeOOH co-catalyst.

The visible light reactivity of Pt/TiO2/(RuL3)-L-II was optimal with [(RuL3)-L-II] = 10 muM, [TiO2] = 0.5 g/L, and Pt loading of about 0.2 wt %. Although no electron donors to regenerate the oxidized Ru-sensitizers were added in the aqueous suspension, the photoreductive dechlorination of perchlorinated compounds proceeded far beyond the stoichiometric limit of the initial sensitizer concentration. Water acted as an electron donor to regenerate the sensitizer with a concurrent production of dioxygen. On the other hand, Pt/TiO2/(RuL3)-L-II was completely inactive in the presence of dissolved oxygen and the in-situ generated dioxygen gradually decelerated the dechlorination rate. Conduction band electrons transferred to 02 in preference to CCl4 and TCA on Pt deposits. Other noble metals (Ag, Au, and Pd) deposited on TiO2 showed a better oxygen-tolerance but less visible-light reactivity than Pt/TiO2/(RuL3)-L-II. Effects of metal loading on the visible light activity and its implications for the efficient visible-light photocatalyst development are discussed.									345	37	0	0	63	0	370			0013-936X			WOS:000180246200038	12542303

In this work, a facile precursor route is developed to synthesize flower-like nickel phosphide microballs with a diameter of approximately 12 mu m. With a controlled phosphorization temperature, flower-like nickel phosphide microballs with different crystalline structures (Ni5P4 and Ni2P) were obtained easily. Flower-like Ni5P4 microballs possessed two advantageous features for enhanced HER: fast vectorial electron transfer path along the building block nanoplates and enhanced inherent catalytic activity of each active site for high-energy (001) facets. The flower-like Ni5P4 microballs electrocatalyst thus displayed excellent activity for the HER with a low overpotential (eta) of 35.4mV to reach current densities of 10 mAcm(-2) and a small Tafel slope of 48 mVdec(-1) in acid solution. In addition, it showed excellent activity in 1m KOH with eta = 47 mV at 10 mAcm(-2). DFT studies indicated that the free energy of hydrogen adsorbed on the Ni site of Ni5P4 was 0.152 eV, which is smaller than that of the Ni site of Ni2P (0.182 eV). Therefore, flower-like Ni5P4 microballs exhibited better HER activity than Ni2P, which is consistent with our HER data. This hierarchical structure with exposed high-energy (001) facets paves the way to design and synthesize low-cost, high-performance catalysts for the HER.									44	2	0	0	1	0	44			1864-5631	1864-564X		WOS:000418660700015	28971593

Exposure of Stylophora pistillata to 33 and 34 degrees C for 4 h resulted in (1) the development of strong non-photochemical quenching (qN) of the chlorophyll fluorescence signal, (2) marked decreases in photosynthetic oxygen evolution, and (3) decreases in optimal quantum yield (F-v/F-m) of photosystern II (PSII), Quantum yield decreased to a greater extent on the illuminated surfaces of coral branches than on lower (shaded) surfaces, and also when high irradiance intensities were combined with elevated temperature (33 degrees C as opposed to 28 degrees C), qN collapsed in heat-stressed samples when quenching analysis was conducted in the absence of oxygen, Collectively, these observations are interpreted as the initiation of photoprotective dissipation of excess absorbed energy as heat (qN) and O-2-dependent electron flow through the Mehler-Ascorbate-Peroxidase cycle (MAP-cycle) following the point at which the rate of light-driven electron transport exceeds the capacity of the Calvin cycle. A model for coral bleaching is proposed whereby the primary site of heat damage in S, pistillata is carboxylation within the Calvin cycle, as has been observed during heat damage in higher plants, Damage to PSII and a reduction in F-v/F-m (i.e. photoinhibition) are secondary effects following the overwhelming of photoprotective mechanisms by light. This secondary factor increases the effect of the primary variable, temperature. Potential restrictions of electron flow in heat-stressed zooxanthellae are discussed with respect to Calvin cycle enzymes and the unusual status of the dinoflagellate Rubisco, Significant features of our model are that (1) damage to PSII is not the initial step in the sequence of heat stress in zooxanthellae, acid (2) light plays a key secondary role in the initiation of the bleaching phenomena.									444	0	1	0	404	2	452			0140-7791	1365-3040		WOS:000078458900002

However, during respiration, reactive oxygen species (ROSs) are inherently (inevitably) generated, and threaten the cell's survival. Therefore, living organisms (or cells) must furnish the potent defense systems to keep such ROSs at harmless level, where the cofactor balance plays crucial roles. Namely, NADH is the source of energy generation (catabolism) in the respiratory chain reactions, through which ROSs are generated, while NADPH plays important roles not only for the cell synthesis (anabolism) but also for detoxifying ROSs. Therefore, the cell must rebalance the redox ratio by modulating the fluxes of the central carbon metabolism (CCM) by regulating the multi-level regulation machinery upon genetic perturbations and the change in the growth conditions.Here, we discuss about how aerobes accomplish such cofactor homeostasis against redox perturbations. In particular, we consider how single-gene mutants (including pgi, pfk, zwf, gnd and pyk mutants) modulate their metabolisms in relation to cofactor rebalance (and also by adaptive laboratory evolution). We also discuss about how the overproduction of NADPH (by the pathway gene mutation) can be utilized for the efficient production of useful value-added chemicals such as medicinal compounds, polyhydroxyalkanoates, and amino acids, all of which require NADPH in their synthetic pathways. We then discuss about the metabolic responses against oxidative stress, where alpha ketoacids play important roles not only for the coordination between catabolism and anabolism, but also for detoxifying ROSs by non-enzymatic reactions, as well as for reducing the production of ROSs by repressing the activities of the TCA cycle and respiration (via carbon catabolite repression). Thus, we discuss about the mechanisms (basic strategies) that modulate the metabolism from respiration to respiro-fermentative metabolism causing overflow, based on the role of Pyk activity, affecting the NADPH production at the oxidative pentose phosphate (PP) pathway, and the roles of aketoacids for the change in the source of energy generation from the oxidative phosphorylation to the substrate level phosphorylation.									20	1	0	0	15	0	21			0734-9750	1873-1899		WOS:000500376100013	31472206

Building on an in-depth understanding of Li-CO2 electrochemistry, novel flexible Li-CO2 batteries and key factors are summarized. Furthermore, based on advanced research progress in the past several years, we identify the main problems, controversies, and challenges currently existing in various battery components that remain to be addressed to design more practicable Li-CO2/O-2 and Li-CO2 batteries.

Although past models have suggested carboxylic acids to be present in significant amounts, recent evidence has shown otherwise. Toward the production of carboxyl-graphene, a synthetic method is presented herein based on the Kolbe- Schmitt process. A modified procedure of heating graphite oxide in the presence of a KOH/CaO mixture results in up to 11 atom % of carboxylic groups. The graphite oxide starting material and reaction temperature were investigated as two important factors, where a crumpled morphology of graphite oxide flakes and a lower 220 degrees C temperature preferentially led to greater carboxyl functionalization. Successful carboxylation caused a band gap opening of similar to 2.5 eV in the smallest carboxyl graphene particles, which also demonstrated a yellow fluorescence under UV light unseen in its counterpart produced at 500 degrees C. These results are in good agreement with theoretical calculations showing band gap opening and spin polarization of impurity states. This demonstrates the current synthetic process as yet another approach toward tuning the physical properties of graphene.									36	1	0	0	6	0	36			1936-0851	1936-086X		WOS:000395357300072	28094511

The first line of the defence is at the interface between the pathogen and its host is at the cell wall and its subjacent plasma membrane. Thus, one of the important non-specific changes in cells on pathogen stress is the change of membrane permeability that in turn disturbs ion homeostasis. For a more complete understanding of the mechanisms of the cell response to the infection, three known effectors of ion permeability in the plant cell plasma membrane were used, namely Gd3+, RNase, and ATP. Gd3+ is a Ca2+-channel inhibitor and possibly affects other ion channels in the plasma membrane. It is thought that the action of RNase may be through low molecular fragments formed by the hydrolysis of high molecular RNA degradation. ATP in the living cell not only has an energetic role but also takes part directly, for instance through cyclic AMP, and/or indirectly in intracellular metabolic signalling, resulting in the activation of the reactions involved in phosphorylation, catalyzed by the membrane kinases. It is considered that changes in the distribution of ions between the cytoplasm and the external environment alter the energy metabolism of the cells because ion homeostasis is an active energy-requiring process, which is tightly related to the intensity of its defence reactions.The results showed that the changes in the energy metabolism of the cells depend on the requirements of them for coping with changes of the environment. Thus, the separate application of Gd3+, RNase and ATP had an insignificant effect on the rates of heat production and oxygen consumption in the dark, photosynthesis measured as oxygen evolution, generation of superoxide on the Chlorella cells, grown under the optimal condition. On the other hand, the rate of the energetic processes significantly increased when infected Chlorella were challenged separately by the three compounds. It was concluded that an additional expenditure of metabolic energy necessary for the defence of microalgal cells in stress conditions. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V.

These materials have been found to yield promising properties, such as high strength in combination with sufficient ductility as well as high wear and corrosion resistance. Especially for alloys with a body-centered cubic (bcc) structure, advantageous surface properties have been revealed. However, typical HEA systems contain high contents of expensive or scarce elements. Consequently, applying them as coatings where their use is limited to the surface represents an exciting pathway enabling economical exploitation of their superior properties. Nevertheless, processing conditions strongly influence the resulting microstructure and phase formation, which in turn has a considerable effect on the functional properties of HEAs. In the presented study, microstructural differences between high-velocity oxygen fuel (HVOF) and high-velocity air fuel (HVAF) sprayed coatings of the alloy AlCrFeCoNi are investigated. A metastable bcc structure is formed in both coating processes. Precipitation reactions are suppressed by the rapid solidification during atomization and by the relatively low thermal input during spraying. The coating resistance to corrosive media was investigated in detail, and an improved passivation behavior was observed in the HVAF coatings.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			1059-9630	1544-1016		WOS:000694622600002

It has been found that the cobalt precursor, the organic macrocycle and the active carbon are simultaneously needed during the heat treatment in inhert atmosphere. Their contemporaneous presence is useful to obtain a material on which the dispersed metal is able to catalyse reactions that produce pores or tunnels inside the carbon, thus resulting in an enhanced contact area. The organic macrocycle is only partially decomposed and the residual fraction could enhance the conductivity. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

In this work, the catalytic performance of three types of MoS2 electrocatalysts is systematically investigated. The density of states shows noticeable improvement in the electrical conductivity for sulfur-vacancy defective MoS2 (V-S-MoS2) than that of pure MoS2, as it facilitates the following electrocatalytic nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR). V-S-MoS2 possesses excellent NRR catalytic performance with a limiting potential of -0.48 V, an outstanding NH3 average yield of 29.55 mu g h(-1) mg(cat.)(-1) at -0.5 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE), and a high faraday efficiency of 4.58 % at -0.3 V vs RHE. The hydrogenation of *N-NH to *NH-NH is the rate determining step of the enzymatic mechanism. These results demonstrate the feasibility of V-S-MoS2 for electrocatalytic ammonia synthesis.									11	0	0	0	0	0	11			2196-0216			WOS:000656984500001

A strong geochemical fingerprint was obtained with an aligned Cl/Br ratio of 154 in the salinized aquitard porewater over a wide Cl- concentration range (396-9,720 mg/L), indicating that porewater salinity is likely derived from a mixing with old brine with a proportion of less than 20%. Very small contributions of brine exerted limited effects on water stable isotopes. The relationships between porewater delta O-18 and delta D indicate that shallow and intermediate porewaters could be original seawater and were subsequently diluted with modern meteoric water, whereas deep porewaters with depleted stable isotopic values were probably recharged during a cooler period and modified by evaporation and seawater infiltration. The cation-Cl relationship and mineralogy of associated strata indicate that porewater has been chemically modified by silicate weathering and ion-exchange reactions. Sr-87/Sr-86 ratios of 0.7094-0.7112 further confirm the input source of silicate minerals. Numerical simulations were used to evaluate the long-term salinity evolution of the deep porewater. The alternations of boundary conditions (i.e., the third aquifer mixed with brine at approximately 70 ka BP, followed by recharge of glacial meltwater at 20-25 ka BP, and then mixing with Holocene seawater at 7-10 ka BP) are responsible for the shift in porewater salinity. These timeframes correspond with the results of previous studies on ancient marine transgression-regression in Jiangsu coastal plain.									12	4	0	0	10	0	15			1431-2174	1435-0157		WOS:000415195900012

Understanding the extent of this limitation is essential in designing a highly efficient solar fuel conversion device. In the present study, the local pH between the anode and cathode in a water splitting cell is monitored in situ using fluorescence pH sensor foils. By this direct visualization, we confirm that supporting buffer ions effectively suppress local pH changes, and we show that electrochemical reactions induce natural electrolyte convection in a non-stirred cell. The observed electrolyte convection at low current densities (<2 mA cm(-2)) originates from buoyancy effects due to the change in the local electrolyte density by ion depletion and accumulation. A multiphysics simulation that includes the buoyancy effect reveals that natural convection driven by electrochemical reactions stabilizes the local pH, which is consistent with our experimental observations. In contrast, the model without the buoyancy effect predicts significant shifts of the local pH away from the pK(a) of the buffer, even at low current densities. This experimentally validated model reveals that natural convection induced by electrochemical reactions significantly affects the overall mass-transport, especially in close vicinity of the electrodes, and it should, therefore, be considered in the design and evaluation of solar fuel conversion devices.									27	0	0	0	3	0	27			1754-5692	1754-5706		WOS:000599751100037

From an experimental perspective, the possible fuel cells' electrocatalytic reaction mechanisms are obtained throughin situelectrochemical spectroscopy techniques and density functional theory calculations, providing theoretical guidance for further development of novel nanocatalysts. As advanced nanocatalysts for fuel cells' electrochemical reactions, alloy nanomaterials have greatly improved electrocatalytic activity and stability and have attracted widespread attention. Enhanced electrocatalytic performance of alloy nanocatalysts could be closely related to the synergistic effects, such as electronic and strain effects. Depending on the arrangement of atoms, alloys can be classified into random alloy and intermetallic compounds (ordered structure). Intermetallic compounds generally have lower heats of formation and stronger heteroatomic bonding strength relative to the random alloy, resulting in high chemical and structural stability in either full pH solutions or electrochemical tests. Here, we summarize the latest advances and the structure-function relationship of noble metal alloy nanocatalysts, among which Pt-based catalysts are the main ones, as well as comprehensively understand why they significantly affect the electrocatalytic performance of fuel cells. Novel alloy nanocatalysts with a robust three-phase interface to achieve efficient charge and mass transfer can obtain desirable activity and stability in the electrochemical workstation tests, and is expected to acquire a higher power density on fuel cell test systems with harsh test conditions.									14	0	0	0	0	0	14			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000578100000004	32986070

In the electrochemical water oxidation, the material exhibits a lower overpotential, by similar to 100 mV, than monometallic Co-based solid-state materials (e.g., Co(OH)(2) and Co3O4)-catalytic systems that were recently reported to be effective for this reaction. Moreover, the material's turnover frequency (TOF) per Co atoms is >10 times as high as those of the latter at the same applied potentials. The Zn-Co-LDH also catalyzes oxidation of alcohols to the corresponding aldehydes or ketones at relatively low temperature, with moderate to high conversion and excellent selectivity.									332	21	0	0	19	0	343			0002-7863	1520-5126		WOS:000327413300002	24116900

Cu-auxiliary cobalt oxide (CuxCo3-xO4) was synthesized with the dispersion co-precipitation method. As-prepared CuCo2O4 performed as the best catalyst for Fenton degradation on nitrogen-containing organic compound as methylene blue (C16H18N3ClS) in water and N,N-dimethylacetamide [CH3CON(CH3)(2)] in industrial wastewater. Lattice substation of Cu2+ to Co2+ ion increased the oxygen vacancies and catalytic activity. The catalyst stability was improved owing to hybrid polarization confinement (total metal elution less than 0.8 mg/L). Methylene blue in water (C-0 = 100 mg/L) was completely decolorized in 50 min using 0.6 g/L CuCo2O4 and 0.09 M H2O2 at intrinsic pH 6.7. Degradation reaction rate constant was increased by two folds as k = 0.076 min(-1) catalyzed by CuCo2O4 over k = 0.039 min(-1) by Co3O4. DMAc-contaminant wastewater of high CODs 19,080 mg/L was treated using 2.4 g/L CuCo2O4 and 2.4 M H2O2 at intrinsic pH = 7.6. Removal rate of DMAc was enhanced from 81 to 99% in the ceramic membrane reactor when H2O2 was activated, and self-sweeping effect was suppressed. As a result, Total Organic Nitrogen (2900 mg/L) in the wastewater was mineralized by 99.9% with a fast transformation to inorganic NO3- ion. Biodegradability of the resistant organic wastewater was remarkably improved, and BOD/COD was increased by 18 folds.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			2190-5487	2190-5495		WOS:000766202500005

The Tongjiachong Cu deposit, located in the northern margin of the Yangtze Block in South China, is hosted by dolostone of the Ediacaran Doushantuo Formation. Empirical geothermometric calculation indicates that the pre-ore chlorite was formed at 265-305 degrees C. Copper mineralization occurs mainly as veinlets in a calcite-chalcopyrite-bornite +/- ankerite assemblage. Exsolution lamellae of chalcopyrite from bornite indicate that both minerals were formed coevally at 200-250 degrees C. Mineral chemical analysis on the syn-ore hydrothermal calcite from Tongjiachong suggests that all the calcite samples are enriched in rare earth elements and yttrium (REYs) (Sigma REY = 53.7-119.9 ppm). They have similar Y/Ho (38.3-42.3) and varying La/Ho (21.8-86.7), and display consistent convex PAAS-normalized REY patterns. The distinct positive Eu anomalies (2.38-3.45) and lack of Yb anomalies (0.92-1.05) suggest initial fluid temperatures of 250 to 420 degrees C and calcites deposition temperatures of < 250 degrees C. The lack of negative Ce anomalies reflects suboxic to anoxic conditions of the ore-forming fluids.Dolomite samples from the dolostone ore host show a marine carbonate C-O isotopic affinity (C-13(PDB) = - 4.0 to - 2.7 parts per thousand; delta O-18(SMOW) = +19.8 to +20.2 parts per thousand). Comparatively, the hydrothermal calcite contains lower C-13(PDB)(-7.4 to -6.1 parts per thousand) and delta O-18(SMOW )(+14.1 to +14.8 parts per thousand), and display a positive C-13(PDB) vs. delta(OSMOW)-O-18 correlation. Simulated calculations of water-rock (W/R) interactions and ore geological constraints suggest that the initial fluids were likely originated from organic-rich formation water. We proposed that W/R reactions may have been the main drive for calcite precipitation at Tongjiachong, whilst decreasing temperature and W/R reactions may have led to the chalcopyrite precipitation.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0169-1368	1872-7360		WOS:000512220700012

However, for aqueous-based reactions that make gas products, such as CO2 reduction and water splitting into CO/H-2, current densities below 1 mA cm(-2) have been necessary to prevent formation of bubbles at the electrode; such bubbles can stick to the AFM probe and prevent further AFM imaging. Here, we demonstrate a novel cell design with a gas-diffusion electrode (GDE) to exhaust the gas products, thereby enabling high current density EC-AFM measurements at 1, 10, and 100 mA cm(-2) that are not disturbed by bubble formation at the electrode surface. These experiments revealed a stable morphological structure of Cu catalysts deposited on GDEs during high current density operation. Systematic spatially resolved maps of deformation and adhesion showed no signs of a gas-liquid interface between catalyst particles of the GDE.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			0013-4651	1945-7111		WOS:000638076400001

In snails, highly toxic reactive oxygen species (ROS) can be continually generated by hemocytes in response to foreign particles or pathogens, and may be involved in damaging and eliminating digenean larvae. Thioredoxin-related protein of 14 kDa (TRP14) is a member of the Trx superfamily, and plays an important role in the scavenging of ROS. This study was designed to identify and characterize TRP14 from O. hupensis (OhTRP14), and investigate the involvement of OhTRP14 in the scavenging of ROS in snail host immune response to the parasite S. japonicum. Here we expressed and purified the recombinant OhTRP14 and its mutant, and rOhTRP14 displayed oxidoreductase activity dependent on the CPDC motif. OhTRP14 protein was ubiquitously present in all the tested snail tissues, and especially immunolocalized in the cytoplasm of immune cell types (hemocytes). Both the expression of OhTRP14 and ROS level increased significantly in snails following challenge with S. japonicum. The dsRNA-mediated knockdown of OhTRP14 was successfully conducted by oral feeding, and ROS production was increased by OhTRP14 knockdown, implying that OhTRP14 was involved in the scavenging of ROS in O. hupensis circulating hemocytes. Therefore, we conclude that OhTRP14 may be involved in the scavenging of ROS in snail host immune response to the parasite S. japonicum. The results expand our understanding of the interaction between this parasite and host, and lay a foundation for the establishment of Oncomelania-schistosome infection models.									2	0	0	0	2	0	2			0166-6851	1872-9428		WOS:000450378900006	30176262

Herein a new strongly coupled nickel-cobalt nitrides/carbon complex nanocage (NiCoNzocage) is rationally designed via chemical etching of ZIF-67 nanocubes with Ni(NO3)(2) under sonication at room temperature, following nitridation. The as-prepared strongly coupled NiCoN/C nanocages exhibit a mass activity of 0.204 mA mu g(-1) at an overpotential of 200 mV for the HER in alkaline solution, which is comparable to that of commercial Pt/C (0.451 mA mu g(-1)). The strongly coupled NiCoN/C nanocages also possess superior stability for the HER with negligible current loss under the overpotentials of 200 mV for 10 h. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that the excellent HER performance under alkaline condition arises from the robust Co2+-> Co-0 transformation achieved by strong (Ni, Co)-N-bonding-induced efficient d-p-d coupled electron transfer, which is a key for optimal initial water adsorption and splitting. The high degree of amorphization urges the C-sites to be an electron-pushing bath to promote the inter-layer/sites electron-transfer with loss of the orbital-selection-forbidden-rule, which uniformly boosts the surface catalytic activities up to a high level independent of the individual surface active sites.									194	12	0	0	13	0	194			0935-9648	1521-4095		WOS:000455111100019	30417441

Although g-C3N4 nanosheets exfoliated from the bulk g-C3N4 powders are extensively emerged, developing a simple synthetic approach is still full of challenge. To this end, here we report a direct polymerization strategy to fabricate the ultrathin g-C3N4 nanosheets, that is only heating treatment of thiourea in air without addition of any template. The photocatalytic activities of as-prepared samples were evaluated by photoreduction of water to hydrogen (H-2) using triethanolamine as sacrificial agent and Pt as co-catalyst under visible-light irradiation (lambda > 420 nm). As a result, our few-layered g-C3N4 nanosheets with an average thickness of 3.5 nm exhibit a superior visible-light photocatalytic H-2 evolution rate (HER) of 1391 mu mol g(-1) h(-1) and a remarkable apparent quantum efficiency of 6.6% at 420 nm. Eventually, the HER of as-fabricated ultrathin g-C3N4 nanosheets is not only much higher than the dicyandiamide-derived g-C3N4 or melamine-derived g-C3N4, but also greater than the thermal-oxidation etched g-C3N4 nanosheets under the same condition.

Influence of pyrolysis conditions								JOURNAL OF ANALYTICAL AND APPLIED PYROLYSIS				67	2			263	276	PII S0165-2370(02)00066-9	10.1016/S0165-2370(02)00066-9				MAY 2003	2003	Compositional transformations occurring during natural coalification generally lead to increased coking potential of coals characterised in the resulting cokes by large sizes of molecular orientation domains (MOD) determined through transmission electron microscopy with 002 dark field mode. In this study, two sets of perhydrous low-rank vitrains (WJV and UCV) have been pyrolysed using an open-system with two heating rates in an attempt to increase their coking potential. Results show that, despite the high potentialities of such vitrains for producing hydrocarbons, i.e. a suspensive medium efficient for their cokefaction, each of the pyrolysis methods does not lead to solid residues chemically equivalent to natural coking coals, since the cokes from these residues are always made of smaller MOD than those obtained for coking coals. For comparison, a similar characterisation, carried out on a conventional vitrain (Fouthiaux) pyrolysed in a confined-system which prevents the release of hydrocarbons, leads also to non-coking coals. The formation of such MOD is likely due to the peculiar chemical composition of the precursors and/or the pyrolysis conditions. FTIR data show that perhydrous vitrains are characterised by a low degree of condensation of aromatic units with a very small concentration of aromatic rings of large size. Thermal treatment originates depolymerisation reactions in the vitrinite network with the formation of low molecular weight products which are not efficient to form large anisotropic domains. The oxygen, present in relatively high amount in some vitrains (UCV and Fouthiaux) might also act as a crosslinking agent preventing the formation of large MOD. Furthermore, while open-medium pyrolysis leads to an important effluent release, as shown by the rapid decrease of H/C ratio, hydrocarbon effluents are conversely retained within the coal matrix in the case of confined-medium pyrolysis. However, the latter pyrolysis induces secondary cracking reactions leading to the formation of lighter products. Therefore, the enhancement of coking properties has not been totally reached by our experiments insofar as they did not lead to oxygen-poor artificially matured coals, similar to natural coking coals.

In this work CVD of titania layers from titanium tetraisopropoxide (TTIP) and oxygen at 1 kPa and in the substrate temperature range T-s = 300-500 degrees C was studied. It was found that growth of TiO2 is a nonstationary process. Two periods of time characterized by different deposition rates were observed. Formation of amorphous TiO2 occurs at the initial period of the deposition process whereas polycrystalline titania with anatase crystal structure is deposited at the second period. Substrate temperature determines degree of crystallinity, texture, and microstructure of the deposited titania layers. (C) 2015 WILEY - VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

In this regard, the photocatalytic stability of exfoliated single- and few-layer MoS2 immersed in water is investigated by mu-Raman spectroscopy. We find that while the basal plane of MoS2 can be treated as stable under photocatalytic conditions, the edge sites and presumably also defect sites are highly affected by a photoinduced corrosion process. The edge sites of MoS2 monolayers are significantly more resistant to photocatalytic degradation compared to MoS2 multilayer edge sites. The photostability of MoS2 edge sites depends on the photon energy with respect to the band gap in MoS2 and also on the presence of oxygen in the electrolyte. These findings are interpreted in the framework of an oxidation process converting MoS2 into MoOx in the presence of oxygen and photoinduced charge carriers. The high stability of the MoS2 basal plane under photocatalytic treatment under visible light irradiation of extreme light intensities on the order of P approximate to 10 mW/mu m(2) substantiates MoS2's potential as photocatalyst for solar hydrogen production.									168	8	0	0	16	0	170			1936-0851	1936-086X		WOS:000365464800079	26536283

This technique allowed us to catch the first steps of the alpha --> beta transformation in Mg2SiO4. A TEM study of the run products showed that a structurally disordered phase is an intermediate of the reaction. The oxygen sublattice of this intermediate phase is well ordered, but a very large density of planar faults on (010) planes destroys the long range order in the cation sublattices. A two-steps mechanism for the alpha --> beta transformation is therefore probable, involving first the nucleation of the structurally disordered phase, then the ordering of this phase. These two steps may be associated with low energy activation barriers and could thus explain the fast kinetics of the alpha --> beta transformation.									38	1	0	0	1	0	38			0094-8276			WOS:A1991EV01000023		
B	Walsh, M.T.								Corrosion of Steel in Submerged Concrete Structures								Corrosion of Steel in Submerged Concrete Structures								139 pp	139 pp						2015	2015	This investigation determined that severe corrosion of steel can occur in the submerged portions of reinforced concrete structures in marine environments. Field studies of decommissioned pilings from actual bridges revealed multiple instances of strong corrosion localization, showing appreciable local loss of steel cross-section. Quantitative understanding of the phenomenon and its causes was developed and articulated in the form of a predictive model. The predictive model output was consistent with both the corrosion rate estimates and the extent of corrosion localization observed in the field observations. The most likely explanation for the observed phenomena that emerged from the understanding and modeling is that cathodic reaction rates under oxygen diffusional limitation that are negligible in cases of uniform corrosion can nevertheless support substantial corrosion rates if the corrosion becomes localized. A dynamic evolution form of the model was created based on the proposition that much of the steel in the submerged concrete zone remained in the passive condition given cathodic prevention that resulted from favorable macrocell coupling with regions of the steel that had experienced corrosion first. The model output also matched observations from the field, supporting the plausibility of the proposed scenario. The modeling also projected that corrosion in the submerged zone could be virtually eliminated via the use of sacrificial anode cathodic protection; the rate of corrosion damage progression in the low elevation zone above water could also be significantly reduced. Continuation work should be conducted to define an alternative to the prevalent limit-state i.e., visible external cracks and spalls, for submerged reinforced concrete structures. Work should also be conducted to determine the possible structural consequences of this form of corrosion and to assess the technical feasibility and cost/benefit aspects of incorporating protective anodes in new pile construction.									0	0	0		0	0	0					978-13-392-8850-5	INSPEC:16264364

WO3 nanowires were first grown by annealing tungsten thin films under argon ambient. WSe2 nanotubes were then grown at the tips of WO3 nanowires through selenization via two steps: (i) formation of tubular WSe2 structures on the outside of WO3 nanowires, resulting in core (WO3)-shell (WSe2) and (ii) growth of WSe2 nanotubes at the tips of WO3 nanowires. The observed seed growth is markedly different from existing substitutional growth of WSe2 nanotubes, where oxygen atoms are replaced by selenium atoms in WO3 nanowires to form WSe2 nanotubes. Another advantage of our growth is that WSe2 film was grown by simply supplying hydrogen gas, where the native oxides were reduced to thin film instead of forming oxide nanowires. Our findings will contribute to engineer other transition metal dichacogenide growth such as MoS2, WS2, and MoSe2.									13	0	0	0	0	0	13			1613-6810	1613-6829		WOS:000354489900012	25581340

With the addition of YH2 nanoparticles, Y2Ti2O7 nanoparticles in coherent with -Fe matrix were generated firstly in the Al-containing ODS alloys due to the reaction of YH2 with Ti and excessive oxygen in the system. When Y2O3 nanoparticles were completely replaced by YH2 nanoparticles, the dispersed oxides in the ODS alloy has the most narrow size distribution from 3 to 30nm and a small mean size of about 9nm. The tensile strength of the ODS alloy increased remarkably with the increasing YH2 content. This provides a promising way to control the structure and size of the oxide nanoparticles and develop the high performance Al-containing ODS alloys.									7	1	0	0	0	0	7			1438-1656	1527-2648		WOS:000354417300015

Model-based TR prediction is critically needed to optimize safety designs of cells. This paper presents a novel scheme for developing reliable battery TR model from kinetics analysis of cell components. First, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) tests on the individual cell components and their mixtures are conducted to reveal the TR mechanism and characterize the exothermic reactions, of which the major six (such as the decomposition of solid electrolyte interface (SEI) film) are determined as the dominant heat sources. The kinetics parameters of each exothermic reactions are identified from the DSC tests results at variant heating rates using Kissinger's method and nonlinear fitting method. A predictive battery TR model is established by superimposing the chemical kinetics equations of the six exothermic reactions. The model fits well with the adiabatic TR test results and the oven tests results of a 24 Ah lithium-ion battery, indicating that the model can well reflect the battery TR mechanism and be trusted to predict battery safety performance without assembling a real battery.									133	13	0	0	2	0	143			0306-2619	1872-9118		WOS:000447479400051

However, decades ago, single-atom catalysts could not be clearly visualized and characterized due to limitations associated with instrument resolution. In recent years, with the rapid development of characterization techniques, high-resolution scanning tunneling microscopy (STM), high-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM), extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS), X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES), diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy (DRIFTS), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and other characterization techniques have been used to accurately represent single-atom catalysts. In this review, we discuss in depth these characterization techniques for Pt single-atom catalysts and focus on Fourier transformed EXAFS spectroscopy to study the coordination environment of Pt-M (M = Cl, O, C, N, S, Pt, Cu, Pd, Ni, Fe) for atomically dispersed Pt catalysts on diverse supports. We believe that this review will lead to better understanding of the effective characterization of Pt single-atom catalysts and promote further research on Pt single-atom catalysis in the future.									74	4	0	0	4	1	74			2044-4753	2044-4761		WOS:000487788800001

They react with MT mainly by forming a thiyl radical with a rate constant of 1.7 X 10(12) dm(3) mol(-1) s(-1). The thiyl radical reacts rapidly but reversibly with a thiolate function to form RSSR-: RS. + RS-GRAPHICSRSSR-. The kinetics of the formation and decay of this radical anion have been studied pulse radiolytically by monitoring the evolution of the optical absorption of RSSR- at 450 nm. This process is mostly intermolecular, i.e. bimolecular in MT. In the absence of O-2, RSSR- decays bimolecularly: RSSR- + RS.GRAPHICSRSSR + RS-. In the presence of O-2, RS. may be scavenged by O-2 and thus the yield of RSSR- decreases: RS + O-2GRAPHICSRSOO.. Under these conditions RSSR- decays by first-order kinetics: RSSR- + O-2GRAPHICSRSSR + O-2-. The rate constants of these reactions have been determined at room temperature: k(4) = 1.8 X 10(9) dm(3) mol(-1) s(-1), k(5) = 7 X 10(4) s(-1), k(10) = 9.2 X 10(8) dm(3) mol(-1) s(-1), and k(18) about 3 X 10(7) dm(3) mol(-1) s(-1). From the dependence of the maximal absorbance at 450 nm the thiolate concentration in the absence. of oxygen, epsilon(RSSR(.-))= 9 X 10(3) dm(3) mol(-1) cm(-1) and the stability constant (K-4/5) of 2.3 X 10(4) dm(3) mol(-1) was determined. K-4/5 is in good agreement with that determined kinetically, k(4)/k(5) = 2.6 X 10(4) dm(3) mol(-1). The stability constant K-15/16 of the thiylperoxyl radical, RSOO(.), was determined to be 5.5 X 10(3) dm(3) mol(-1) .									16	2	0	0	6	0	17			0955-3002	1362-3095		WOS:A1995TE72600013	7594972

Although the NaBH4 treatment and Co-Pi coating have exhibited a synergetic effect on reducing the onset potential and enhancing the photocurrent density of the Fe2O3 photoanode, their intrinsic interaction is still poorly understood. In this work, the synergetic effect has been well-explained by photoelectrochemical tests and the impedance spectroscopy. It is discovered that the surface states locating at the surface of Fe2O3 were mostly passivated by Co-Pi. However, excess surface states formed on the NaBH4 treated Fe2O3 photoanode at a relatively negative potential, which could not be passivated by Co-Pi. Those surface states acted as dual roles, that is, the hole transfer media between Co-Pi and the valence band of Fe2O3 as well as the block layer to prevent the recombination of the photogenerated electrons with Co-Pi. The intuitive result was that surface charge transfer speeded up and the charge recombination slowed down concurrently, which led to a reduced onset potential by 210 mV and an increased photocurrent in the PEC water splitting.

Measured Delta S-33 (approximate to delta S-33-0.515 delta S-34) values range between -2.3 and +8.5 parts per thousand with no apparent meter-scale stratigraphic trend for 70 m section. It was found that early diagenetic pyrites occur in two texturally and isotopically distinct populations such that bulk rock isotope data would reflect mixing of these two sulfur pools. Nodular and layered pyrite yield mostly negative (down to -2.3 parts per thousand) and relatively constant Delta S-33 values over a few tens of cm scale. Disseminated pyrites, in contrast, yield positive (0.0-8.5 parts per thousand) Delta S-33 values that are heterogeneous in sub-cm scales. The former pyrite sulfur was likely derived from seawater sulfate through microbial sulfate reduction, and the latter preferentially sampled aqueous H2S-S-0 reservoirs in late Archean oceans. Relatively constant Delta S-33 values for layered pyrite suggest Archean sulfate reservoirs had residence times of a few million years. Most data yield a well-defined Delta S-36/Delta S-33 ratios of -0.9, suggesting predominance of a single S-MIF source reaction. Four analyses of a two cm length sample (306.5 m) yield Delta S-36/Delta S-33 Slope of -1.6. This slope is consistent with the relationship expected for a symmetry-breaking isotope effect during the S + S-2 reaction, but deviations from the main Archean array (i.e., Delta S-36/Delta S-33 = -0.9) May also result from various combinations of SO photolysis and SO2 oxidation. High spatial resolution-high precision SF6 measurements of Archean pyrite provide significant new insights into the origin of Archean sulfur mass-independent fractionation (S-MIF) and the late Archean sulfur cycle.

J	Ghirardi, Maria L.								Hydrogen production by photosynthetic green algae								INDIAN JOURNAL OF BIOCHEMISTRY & BIOPHYSICS				43	4			201	210						AUG 2006	2006	Oxygenic photosynthetic organisms such as cyanobacteria, green algae and diatoms are capable of absorbing light and storing up to 10-13% of its energy into the H-H bond of hydrogen gas. This process, which takes advantage of the photosynthetic apparatus of these organisms to convert sunlight into chemical energy, could conceivably be harnessed for production of significant amounts of energy from a renewable resource, water. The harnessed energy could then be coupled to a fuel cell for electricity generation and recycling of water molecules. In this review, current biochemical understanding of this reaction in green algae, and some of the major challenges facing the development of future commercial algal photobiological systems for H-2 production have been discussed.									37	1	0	0	25	0	39			0301-1208	0975-0959		WOS:000240011500001	17133763

As a photocatalytic active material for H-2 evolution, CdS is a good candidate. However, the pristine CdS still suffers from low efficiency and poor stability. To address those issues, we developed noble-metal-free CdS@MoS2 core-shell nanoheterostructures which exhibit outstanding photocatalytic H-2 evolution performance thus far with rate of 62.55 mmol g(-1) h(-1), which exceeds that of pristine CdS by a factor of 148. Meanwhile, the photocatalytic stability can be well retained with no deterioration of activity in 24 h reaction. The excellent performance can be reasonably attributed to the low crystallinity of MoS2 with numerous active sites provided, and the band alignment of CdS and MoS2 as determined by valence band-XPS and Mott-Schottky plots analysis, which significantly promotes charge transportation and separation. The enhanced photocatalytic stability here should be ascribed to the intimate growth of MoS2 shells which significantly passivate the surface trap states of CdS cores and thus the photocorrosion is remarkably retarded. This novel strategy will inspire the fabrication of other photocatalytic systems, and may high-efficient photocatalysts be obtained. (C) 2019 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC.

A natural olivine sample from the layered series of the Ivrea-Verbano igneous complex (Western Alps, Italy) was heated in the temperature range 25-1300 degreesC in air and investigated by in situ, real time powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD). The evolution of the peaks (measured integrated intensities) was followed in non-isothermal conditions using variable heating rates (b = 20, 22, 25, 27, and 30degreesC/min). The total time of the experiments ranged from about 256 (b = 30degreesC/min) to 277 (b = 20degreesC/min) min including the time for the data collections. An additional isothermal run was performed at 800degreesC. The analysis of the kinetic data was attempted with the use of different equations including the classical Avrami theory for solid-state reactions. The kinetic results were confirmed by independent experimental data from electron microscopy (SEM, TEM).In the transformation sequence, hematite appears at about 600degreesC producing amorphous segregations. of silica that later recombine with forsterite to form pyroxene Hematite is stable up to 1130degreesC where it is transformed into magnetite. The rate limiting step for the formation of hematite is a two-dimensional diffusion with constant or decelerating nucleation rate and apparent activation energy of 15 kcal/mol. The concentration of Fe3+ in Fe-rich regions favors the heterogeneous nucleation of hematite, which may take place on existing defects or at the grain boundaries with impurity phases such as serpentine. At 1130degreesC, magnetite is formed at the expenses of hematite, with a contracting volume interface-controlled reaction in two or three dimensions with an apparent activation energy of 30-31 kcal/mol. The hematite to magnetite transformation is direct, without a metastable amorphous intermediate. It is described by the "shrinking core model," with the formation of a magnetite outer layer at the surface of the hematite particles that proceeds toward the core of the reacting hematite by diffusion of the oxygen throughout the newly formed magnetite layer. Its rate is limited by the advancement of the reaction front. The rate-limiting step for the formation of pyroxene is two-dimensional diffusion with decelerating nucleation rate with an apparent activation energy of 29 kcal/mol.									21	1	1	0	0	0	23			0003-004X			WOS:000185895500020

Proton concentration in the thylakoid membranes can regulate energy distribution between the two photosystems								PHOTOSYNTHETICA				52	4			636	640		10.1007/s11099-014-0066-1				DEC 2014	2014	The aim of our study was to investigate the role of protons in regulating energy distribution between the two photosystems in the thylakoid membranes. Low pH-induced changes were monitored in the presence of a proton blocker, N,N'-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCCD). When thylakoid membranes were suspended in a low-pH reaction mixture and incubated with DCCD, then a decrease in the fluorescence intensity of photosystem II (PSII) was observed, while no change in the intensity of photosystem I (PSI) fluorescence occurred according to the measured fluorescence emission spectra at 77 K. Since low pH induced distribution of energy from PSII to PSI was inhibited in the presence of DCCD, we concluded that pH/proton concentration of the thylakoid membranes plays an important role in regulating the distribution of the absorbed excitation energy between both photosystems.									4	0	0	0	4	0	4			0300-3604	1573-9058		WOS:000345394500019

The synthesis of a hybrid of platinum nanostructures and nitrogen-doped carbon [Pt-(PtOx)-NSs/C] for HER/HOR applications is reported herein. The HER activity of this Pt-(PtOx)-NSs/C catalyst is 4 and 6.5 times better than that of commercial Pt/C in acids and bases, respectively. The catalyst exhibits a current density of 10mAcm(-2) at overpotentials of 5 and 51 mV, with Tafel slopes of 29 and 64 mVdec(-1) in 0.5 m H2SO4 and 0.5 m KOH. This catalyst also showed superior HOR activity at all pH values. The HER/HOR activity of Pt-(PtOx)-NSs/C and PtOx-free Pt-nanostructures on carbon (PtNSs/C) catalysts are comparable in acid. The presence of PtOx in Pt-(PtOx)-NSs/C makes this Pt catalyst more HER/HOR-active in basic media. The activity of the Pt-(PtOx)-NSs/C catalyst is fivefold higher than that of the PtNSs/C catalyst in basic medium, although their activity is comparable in acid. The hydrogen-binding energy and oxophilicity are two equivalent descriptors for HER/HOR in basic media. A bifunctional mechanism for the enhanced alkaline HER/HOR activity of the Pt-(PtOx)-NSs/C catalyst is proposed. In the bifunctional Pt-(PtOx)-NSs/C catalyst, PtOx provides an active site for OH- adsorption to form OHads, which reacts with hydrogen intermediate (H-ads), present at neighbouring Pt sites to form H2O; this leads to enhancement of the HOR activity in basic medium. This work may provide an opportunity to develop catalysts for various renewable-energy technologies.									42	1	0	0	5	0	42			1864-5631	1864-564X		WOS:000439757800015	29863306

Using detailed stellar models, together with an extensive nuclear reaction network, we have calculated the distribution of the various isotopic abundances around the hydrogen shell at numerous points along the red giant branch. These calculations anew for the variation in both temperature and density in the shell region as well as the timescale of the nuclear processing, as governed by the outward movement of the hydrogen shell. The reaction network uses updated rates over those of Caughlan & Fowler. We find evidence for the production of Na and Al occurring in the NeNa and MgAl cycles. In particular, Na is significantly enhanced throughout the region above the hydrogen shell. The use of the newer reaction rates causes a substantial increase in the production of Al-27 above the hydrogen shell through heavy leakage from the NeNa cycle and should have an important effect on the predicted surface abundances. We also find that the nuclear processing is considerably more extensive at lower metallicities.									70	0	0	0	0	0	70			0004-637X			WOS:A1996UN84100019

In this study, we demonstrate self-templated pseudomorphic transformation of MOF into surface chemistry rich hollow framework that delivers highly reactive, durable, and universal electrochemically active energy conversion and storage functionalities. In situ pseudomorphic transformation of MOF-derived hollow rhombic dodecahedron template and sulfurization of nickel cobalt layered double hydroxides (NiCo-LDHs) lead to the construction of interlayered metal sulfides (NiCoLDH/Co9S8) system. The embedment of metal sulfide species (Co9S8) at the LDH intergalleries offers optimal interfacing of the hybrid constituent elements and materials stability. The hybrid NiCo-LDH/Co9S8 system collectively presents an ideal porous structure, rich redox chemistry, and high electrical conductivity matrix. This leads to a significant enhancement in its complementary electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution and supercapacitive energy storage properties. This work establishes the potential of MOF derived scaffold for designing of novel class hybrid inorganic-organic functional materials for electrochemical applications and beyond.									390	17	0	0	27	0	394			0935-9648	1521-4095		WOS:000404982700008	28466985

It is performed under inert condition at temperature range 200 - 300 degrees C with residence times between 15 - 60 minutes. Torrefied product usually have high energy content, low moisture content and hygroscopic nature which overcome the limitation of raw biomass as biofuel. Therefore, the objective of this study is to investigate the characteristics of torrefied palm mesocarp fiber (PMF) and evolution of volatiles components during torrefaction at 240 degrees C, 270 degrees C, and 300 degrees C in an inert condition. The condensable and non-condensable gases were analyzed using high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GC-MS) respectively. Concurrently, a kinetic model using two reactions in series namely Di Blasi and Lanzetta model is developed to predict the evolution of solid and volatile products during torrefaction process for PMF samples. Based on torrefaction experiments, the mass and energy yields are decreased due to the severe decomposition of biomass at higher temperature but the higher heating value of biomass is increased by 27%. Meanwhile the proximate analysis shows that fixed carbon and ash content are increased by 45% and 25% respectively but volatile matter is decreased by 20%. In addition, the ultimate analysis shows that the elemental ratios of hydrogen to carbon (H/C) and oxygen to carbon (O/C) are decreased by 88% and 20% respectively. For the volatile analysis, 70 - 80% of the total volatile yield is made up from non-condensable gases with high percentage of carbon monoxide (CO) and methane (CH4), while the condensable gases formed was 20-30%. Finally, the anhydrous weight loss model is successfully developed for representing the decomposition of PMF where the kinetic parameters estimated from the model give a good agreement with the residual mass obtained from thermogravimetric analysis.

As CO2 decreased and O-2 increased, Rubisco oxygenase activity increased and 2-phosphoglycolate was produced, with the evolution of pathways recycling this inhibitory product to sugar phosphates. Changed atmospheric composition also selected for Rubiscos with higher CO2 affinity and CO2/O-2 selectivity correlated with decreased CO2-saturated catalytic capacity and/or for CO2-concentrating mechanisms (CCMs). These changes increase the energy, nitrogen, phosphorus, iron, zinc and manganese cost of producing and operating Rubisco-PCRC, while biosphere oxygenation decreased the availability of nitrogen, phosphorus and iron. The majority of algae today have CCMs; the timing of their origins is unclear. If CCMs evolved in a low-CO2 episode followed by one or more lengthy high-CO2 episodes, CCM retention could involve a combination of environmental factors known to favour CCM retention in extant organisms that also occur in a warmer high-CO2 ocean. More investigations, including studies of genetic adaptation, are needed.									197	6	0	0	177	0	200			0962-8436	1471-2970		WOS:000299109100003	22232762

Herein, a one-step facile and easily scalable approach is reported to synthesize ultrafine WC nanocrystals encapsulated in porous N-doped carbon nanospheres (NC) by simple self-polymerization, drying, and annealing. It is worth mentioning that this developed method has four novel features: (1) the synthesis process, without any hard template or hydrocarbon gas feeding, is, notably, very facile and efficient with low cost; (2) the carbon coating on WC nanocrystals not only restrains coarsening of particles but also creates strong coupling interactions between the nanocrystallines and the conductive carbonaceous matrix; (3) uniform grape-like WC@NC nanospheres with high specific surface area can be obtained in a large scale; and (4) single-phase WC can be achieved. As a result, WC@NC demonstrates remarkable hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) electrocatalytic performance with overpotentials of 127 and 141 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) and Tafel slopes of 56.3 and 78.7 mV dec(-1) in acid and alkaline media, respectively. Our density functional theory calculations manifest that the strong synergistic electronic effect between WC and its intimately bonded carbon shell vastly boosts the HER electrocatalytic activity. WC@NC catalysts as a cathode are further tested in a home-made electrolyzer with 0.78 A cm(-2) achieved at a cell voltage of 2 V at 80 degrees C and operated stably at 200 mA cm-2 for more than 20 h.									20	2	0	0	3	0	20			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000476684900030	31195794

Herein, a strategy to advance the fundamental surface study on Pt-based HIFs materials is addressed by implanting non-noble metal or nonmetals as "active auxiliaries" into the near-surface of noble metal nanocrystals bounded with HIFs to engineer a stable structured catalyst. Then the Mo/Pt3Mn catalysts serving as proof-of-concept examples are designed and show enhanced catalytic performance of ethylene glycol (EG). According to the electrochemical in situ Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy results, the Mo modified Pt3Mn alloys with HIFs promote not only the C-C cleavage of EG but also the direct conversion of COHx to CO2, without the formation of COL poison species. In this case, the Mo/Pt3Mn catalysts show the greatly significant increase of the catalytic activity in copamprison with Pt3Mn CNC and the commercial Pt/C, as well as the enhanced stability. The high-resolution transmission electron microscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectrum assisted by Ar surface etching experiments accompanied by density functional theory calculations are further used to explore the structure-performance relationship of Mo/Pt3Mn CNC for electro-oxidation of EG. This study addresses a promising strategy to fabricate a stable structured catalysts, which will elucidate a very promising methodology for developing Pt-based catalysts for further application of the fuel cell.									49	4	0	0	0	0	52			2155-5435			WOS:000455286600046

The mechanism of microbiota homeostasis in host intestines has been well studied in mammals and Drosophila. The reactive oxygen species (ROS) and antimicrobial peptides have been reported to play important roles in homeostasis. However, how to maintain the microbiota homeostasis in crustacean intestine needs to be elucidated. In this study, we identified a novel catalase (MjCAT) involved in ROS elimination in kuruma shrimp, Marsupenaeus japonicus. MjCAT mRNA was widely distributed in hemocytes, heart, hepatopancreas, gills, stomach, and intestine. After the shrimp were challenged with pathogenic bacteria via oral infection, the expression level of MjCAT was upregulated, and the enzyme activity was increased in the intestine. ROS level was also increased in the intestine at early time after oral infection and recovered rapidly. When MjCAT was knocked down by RNA interference (RNAi), high ROS level maintained longer time, and the number of bacteria number was declined in the shrimp intestinal lumen than those in the control group, but the survival rate of the MjCAT-RNAi shrimp was declined. Further study demonstrated that the intestinal villi protruded from epithelial lining of the intestinal wall were damaged by the high ROS level in MjCAT-knockdown shrimp. These results suggested that MjCAT participated in the intestinal host microbe homeostasis by regulating ROS level. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

In this study we focused on oxidative properties of hemoglobin (Hb)modified LDL because Hb is present in atherosclerotic lesions. Under low oxygen tensions Hb was previously found to modify apolipoprotein B100 with covalent binding of Hb fragments and formation of electronegative LDL particles (LDL-). Here we show that HbLDL is highly susceptible to oxidation, but is not cytotoxic to vascular cells, as was found for LDL- isolated from human plasma. HbLDL and LDL-have similar levels of oxidized lipid products and low uptake rates; however, the virtual absence of HbLDL-induced toxicity depends on a marked adaptive oxidative stress response. This was evidenced by a time- and dose-dependent induction of heme oxygenase (HO-1). Cell survival was significantly decreased in the presence of HO-1 inhibitor, tin protoporphyrin (SnPPIX). HO-1 induction by HbLDL increased resistance of cells to toxic doses of hemin or t-BuOOH. The high sensitivity to oxidation and HO-1 induction was largely dependent on lipid hydroperoxides and heme associated with HbLDL. Reduction of pre-existing lipid peroxides using ebselen delayed HbLDL kinetics and inhibited HO-1 induction. Moreover, heme inactivation or its degradation inhibited HO-1 induction and provided an additive inhibitory effect to ebselen. We conclude that Hlb-catalyzed reactions may modulate vascular cell survival and oxidative stress adaptation due to the presence of peroxides and heme, thus providing a possible mechanism for the evolution of atherosclerotic and hemorrhagic lesions.									29	1	0	0	19	0	30			0006-4971	1528-0020		WOS:000184945200036	12750169

The reaction rate constants, degradation mechanism, catalyst stability, and evolution of mineralization and toxicity were detailed investigated. On the basis of radical scavenger results, both the sulfate radicals (SO4-center dot) and hydroxyl radicals ((OH)-O-center dot) were responsible for the degradation of Orange II. A possible pathway is suggested to describe the degradation of Orange II according to the degradation intermediates identified. The results showed that the Fe/SBA-15 catalyst maintained strong reusability and stability with a low level of iron leaching. In addition, favorable mineralization efficiency in terms of COD removal efficiency (75.4%) and TOC removal efficiency (46.3%) was obtained when the reaction time was prolonged to 24 h. The toxicity experiments implied that the toxicity of the treated solution ascended at the first 30 min but then dropped to almost zero eventually. This study provides a proof-of-concept that can be applied widely for the PS remediation of contaminated water. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

TaON hollow spheres coupled with the surface enriched Ta3N5 QDs were prepared by an in situ chemical reduction route in ammonia solution at -45 degrees C and were characterized by X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectra, UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectra and photoluminescence spectra. The Ta3N5-TaON composites containing 4 mol% Ta3N5 QDs showed a high rate of O-2 production at 208.2 mu mol h(-1) with an apparent quantum efficiency of 67% under 420 nm light. The rate of oxygen formation of the Ta3N5-TaON heterojunction was 3.3 times higher than that of the pristine TaON hollow spheres. Furthermore, relative photoelectrochemical properties of Ta3N5-TaON composite photoelectrodes were investigated. The resulting 4 mol% Ta3N5-TaON heterojunction films exhibited a photocurrent of ca. 2.7 mA cm(-2) under visible light irradiation at 1.0 V vs. SCE in Na2SO4 solution. This excellent photocatalytic activity is ascribed to the Ta3N5 QDs that alter the energy levels of the conduction and valence bands in the coupled semiconductor system and the slow recombination of photogenerated electron-hole pairs. Moreover, the Ta3N5-TaON composite exhibited strong durability which could be attributed to the inhibition of Ta3N5 QDs leaching owing to its strong interaction with TaON.									58	1	0	0	3	0	59			0959-9428	1364-5501		WOS:000310047200027

Nanostructured thin films (NTFs) of MoO3 were sulfurized at different temperatures varying from 150 degrees C to 550 degrees C. High-resolution transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images depict core-shell nanoflakes with varying shell thicknesses as the sulfurization temperature (Tsn) is varied. The shells consist of MoS2 and the core is MoO2/MoO3. X-ray diffraction (XRD) and Raman analysis have been used to study the structural changes as MoO3 is sulfurized. The analyses showed two phases, MoO2 and MoS2, at low temperatures (<= 350 degrees C), whereas the films sulfurized at higher temperatures show predominantly MoS2. The scanning electron microscopy (SEM) results show no noticeable changes in the surface morphology of the NTFs after sulfurization. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was carried out to calculate the relative percentages of MoO3, MoO2 and MoS2. It is revealed that sulfurization of MoO3 in the plasma is affected by Tsn. The sulfurization process occurs in two steps, involving the reduction of MoO3 to form MoO2 in the first step, followed by MoO2 being converted into MoS2. It is also evident that the reduction of MoO3 is more a result of the reactive species of hydrogen (H*) than the replacement of oxygen by sulfur in the second step.									34	1	0	0	2	0	34			2053-1591			WOS:000377812300022

The sintering behavior and densification mechanism of the ZnO-SnO2 binary targets were analyzed by systematically studying the oxide powder state, formation process of the solid reaction phase, and evolution of the target microstructure. The data revealed that the ZnO-SnO2 powder treatment improved the sintering activity and the powder dispersion; furthermore, it promoted a mutual reaction between the different components during sintering and the homogeneity of the target composition. The densification of the pure SnO2 ceramic target was difficult to achieve, and the addition of ZnO led to a continuous interaction between the ZnO and SnO2 components. The Zn2SnO4 phase started to form, and a temporary shrinkage of the target occurred above 800 degrees C. After formation of the stable Zn2SnO4 and SnO2 phases, the target shrunk rapidly with increasing temperature, densification occurred during growth, and the two phases started to interact. The sintering temperature provided the driving force for the target densification, with the densification activation energy of the ZnO-SnO2 binary ceramic target estimated to be 580 kJ/mol based on the master sintering curve. A binary ceramic target with a high density (99.78% relative density), a fine grain size, and a homogeneous phase structure was achieved at a temperature of 1600 degrees C. These findings are promising for the further improvement and performance enhancement of SnO2-based materials.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0002-7820	1551-2916		WOS:000851449200001

However, the sluggish kinetic rates of the ammonia electrooxidation reaction, and high cost and poisoning of Pt-based catalysts still remain challenges. This also limits the development of direct ammonia fuel cells. In this work, we directly grew hierarchical mixed NiCu layered hydroxides (LHs) nanowires on carbon fibre cloth electrodes by a facile one-step hydrothermal synthesis method for efficient electro-oxidation of ammonia. This catalyst achieves a current density of 35 mA cm(-2) at 0.55 V vs. Ag/AgCl, which is much higher than that of bare Ni(OH)(2) catalyst (5 mA cm(-2)). This is due to abundant active sites and a synergistic effect between Ni and Cu, possibly due to the formation of Ni1-xCux OOH on the surface of the catalysts through the electrochemical activation of the mixture of Cu(OH)(2) and alpha-Ni(OH)(2). In the investigated first row transition elements, it is found that Cu is the sole first-row transition metal to effectively improve activity of Ni(OH)(2) for ammonia electrooxidation. This mixed NiCu LHs nano-wire catalyst outperforms commercial Pt/C catalyst in the aspects of ammonia oxidation current and stability, demonstrating it to be a promising low-cost and stable catalyst for efficient ammonia electrooxidation in alkaline condition, which is a potential electrode for ammonia fuel cells for power generation or electrolysis of ammonia for ammonia-containing wastewater treatment.

We review the known degradation mechanisms occurring in water-splitting photoelectrochemical devices. The degradation of single components is discussed in detail, and the parameters and conditions which influence it are presented. Device short-term durability depends on the semiconductor material and its interface with the electrolyte. Catalyst and electrolyte degradations are considerable challenges for long-term durability. We highlight how PEC device design choices can affect the salience of alternative degradation mechanisms. The PEC device architecture and the initial operating design point are crucial for observed device performance loss. Device degradation behavior is further impacted by irradiation intensity and concentration, and by current density and concentration. Enhancing a physical understanding of degradation phenomena and investigating their effect on component properties is of utmost importance for predicting performance loss and tackling the durability challenge of PEC devices.									43	0	0	0	0	0	43			0022-3727	1361-6463		WOS:000395880000001

Hence, the mechanism of the electrochemical formation and reduction of surface oxides is fundamental to understand how surface composition can determine the reactivity of the catalyst. In this paper, combined potential step chronoamperometry and cyclic voltammetry were performed to involve oxide formation and its evolution on Pt(1 1 1), in the absence of anion specific adsorption and keeping surface stability (0.95 < E < 1.1 V). As a first approximation, a simple mean field model scheme is outlined to describe the dynamics of the initial states of the electrochemical oxide growth on Pt(1 1 1). Qualitatively, the whole oxidation process can be properly described by the sequential electrochemical oxidation of water, in such a way that the main features of the cyclic voltammogram and potential step profiles can be explained. The results corroborate the existence of at least two different oxidation states of the surface. The first state is formed through a nucleation and growth mechanism controlled by the rate at which the nuclei are formed, i.e. it follows a progressive nucleation mechanism. The second state is a further ageing process that depends on the potential at which the oxide layer is fully developed. The final oxide film slows down subsequent water dissociation.

Dynamic rheometry was used to probe the evolution of dynamic mechanical properties in the adhesive during isothermal curing, and a Fourier-transform infrared spectrometer (FT-IR) was utilized to measure the degree of chemical conversion after curing. It has been found that physical gumminess of the adhesive cured under a selected, normal curing condition was primarily due to the presences of excessive hardener and also liquid residuals of an industrial cleaner containing hydroxyl and amine functional groups, while the presence of excessive epoxy resin at a moderate level arising from non-stoichiometric mixing is unlikely to cause physical gumminess of the cured adhesive mass. Accordingly, it is considered that the selection of a proper cleaner and improvement of stoichiometric adhesive mixing prior to adhesive dispensing is of vital importance to developing reliable and strong adhesive bondlines.					67th Annual Technical Conference of the Society of Plastics Engineers 2009 (ANTEC 2009)67th Annual Technical Conference of the Society of Plastics Engineers 2009 (ANTEC 2009)	22-24 June 200922-24 June 2009		Chicago, IL, USAChicago, IL, USA	0	0	0		0	0	0					978-1-61567-327-8	INSPEC:11250929

Solutions of thioacetic acid and zinc salt (acetate or oxide) dissolved in a solvent (acetic acid or acetone) were investigated and compared with the corresponding zinc precursor and crystalline zinc sulphide to study the evolution of the structural environment around the zinc atoms in the solution. The investigations reveal that the coordination of sulphur atoms take place immediately when the mixture is prepared and zinc-sulphur species gradually evolve during the course of the reaction. However, the complete formation of zinc sulphide could not be evidenced even after a considerable period of time. This is likely due to the presence of unreacted zinc-oxygen species. The obtained results indicate that, once dissolved, zinc oxide reacts comparatively faster with thioacetic acid than with zinc acetate and that the choice of the reaction medium plays a crucial role in determining the kinetics and mechanism of zinc sulphide nucleation.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			0942-9352			WOS:000255325300005

Correctly regulated hemodynamics and delivery of oxygen and metabolic substrates, as well as intact blood-retinal barriers are necessary requirements for the maintenance of retinal structure and function.Retinal blood flow is autoregulated by the interaction of myogenic and metabolic mechanisms through the release of vasoactive substances by the vascular endothelium and retinal tissue surrounding the arteriolar wall. Autoregulation is achieved by adaptation of the vascular tone of the resistance vessels (arterioles, capillaries) to changes in the perfusion pressure or metabolic needs of the tissue. This adaptation occurs through the interaction of multiple mechanisms affecting the arteriolar smooth muscle cells and capillary pericytes.Mechanical stretch and increases in arteriolar transmural pressure induce the endothelial cells to release contracting factors affecting the tone of arteriolar smooth muscle cells and pericytes. Close interaction between nitric oxide (NO), lactate, arachidonic acid metabolites, released by the neuronal and glial cells during neural activity and energy-generating reactions of the retina strive to optimize blood flow according to the metabolic needs of the tissue. NO, which plays a central role in neurovascular coupling, may exert its effect, by modulating glial cell function involved in such vasomotor responses.During the evolution of ischemic microangiopathies, impairment of structure and function of the retinal neural tissue and endothelium affect the interaction of these metabolic pathways, leading to a disturbed blood flow regulation. The resulting ischemia, tissue hypoxia and alterations in the blood barrier trigger the formation of macular edema and neovascularization. Hypoxia-related VEGF expression correlates with the formation of neovessels. The relief from hypoxia results in arteriolar constriction, decreases the hydrostatic pressure in the capillaries and venules, and relieves endothelial stretching. The reestablished oxygenation of the inner retina downregulates VEGF expression and thus inhibits neovascularization and macular edema.Correct control of the multiple pathways, such as retinal blood flow, tissue oxygenation and metabolic substrate support, aiming at restoring retinal cell metabolic interactions, may be effective in preventing damage occurring during the evolution of ischemic microangiopathies.

We calculated, using density functional theory, the surface O vacancy formation energy (E-Ovac) for perovskite-structure oxides, with a transition metal (Ti-Fe) as the B-site cation, to estimate the catalytic reactivity of perovskite oxides. The E-Ovac value correlated well with the band gap and bulk formation energy, which is a trend also found in other oxides. A low E-Ovac value, which is expected to result in higher catalytic activity via the Mars-van Krevelen mechanism, was found in metallic perovskites such as CaCoO3, BaFeO3, and SrFeO3. On the other hand, titanates had high E-Ov(ac) values, typically exceeding 4 eV/atom, suggesting that these materials are less reactive when O vacancy formation is involved in the reaction mechanism.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			2470-1343			WOS:000820329700001	35694487

However, pristine CN has a limited visible-light absorption range and also suffers a high recombination rate of photo-excited charge carriers, resulting in low photocatalytic activity. With the development of modern material characterization technology and electronic structure calculation technology, it is found that vacancy defects in CN play a more decisive role in determining the kinetics, energetics and mechanism of photocatalytic reactions. Therefore, much effort has been made in the past years to enhance the visible light activity of CN through defects control. This review provides the recent progresses and technologies on fabricating defective CN, in which the bottom-up and top-down preparation strategies are systematically summarized. In the meantime, the advancement of defective CN photocatalysts toward versatile applications such as water oxidation, hydrogen production, CO2 reduction, nitrogen fixation, H2O2 and organic synthesis, and pollutants removal are fully discussed. Finally, the existing opportunities and challenges of CN photocatalysts designed with vacancies defects are proposed to highlight the development direction of this field. This paper can lay a theoretical basis and guidance for the preparation of defective graphitic carbon nitride.									18	0	0	0	3	0	18			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000729141800005

Extensively pyrolysis of cellulose to bio-oil initiated at 300 degrees C, reached maximum at 450 degrees C, and shifted to gasification to produce gases as the main products above 650 degrees C. Dehydrate sugars were the initial products formed below 350 degrees C, which soon dehydrated to form furans at ca. 400 degrees C and then generate aliphatic aldehydes, ketones and carboxylic acids at ca. 650 degrees C via the session of the C-C bonds. Aromatization of the volatiles initiated at 350 degrees C, producing phenolics and then further to aromatic hydrocarbons. The medium pyrolysis temperature (i.e. 450 degrees C) tended to produce the heavier bio-oil. The in situ DRIFTS characterization of cellulose pyrolysis showed that the structural reconstruction of the feedstock occurred at ca. 430-440 degrees C, forming abundant C-O functionalities in bio-char. The increasing pyrolysis temperature led to staged change of carbon, hydrogen and oxygen contents in bio-char. The bio-char produced at the low temperature was quite aliphatic, and increasing pyrolysis temperature enhanced the formation of graphite structure, thermal stability and the porosity of bio-char. The bio-char from cellulose had a compact structure with small surface area and very limited mesopores. The results of kinetic analysis showed that the pyrolysis of cellulose was a complex multi-step reaction process.									33	1	0	0	11	0	34			1364-0321	1879-0690		WOS:000592384700001

Recent observations of several nitrogen-bearing species in the interstellar medium suggest abundances in sharp disagreement with current chemical models. Although some of these observations show that some gas-grain processes are at work, gas-phase chemistry needs first to be revisited. Strong constraints are provided by recent Herschel observations of nitrogen hydrides in cold gas. The aim of the present work is to comprehensively analyse the interstellar chemistry of nitrogen, focussing on the gas-phase formation of the smallest polyatomic species and, in particular, on nitrogen hydrides. We present a new chemical network in which the kinetic rates of critical reactions have been updated based on recent experimental and theoretical studies, including nuclear spin branching ratios. Our network thus treats the different spin symmetries of the nitrogen hydrides self-consistently, together with the ortho and para forms of molecular hydrogen. This new network is used to model the time evolution of the chemical abundances in dark cloud conditions. The steady-state results are analysed, with special emphasis on the influence of the overall amounts of carbon, oxygen, and sulphur. Our calculations are also compared with Herschel/HIFI observations of NH, NH2, and NH3 detected towards the external envelope of the protostar IRAS 16293-2422. The observed abundances and abundance ratios are reproduced for a C/O gas-phase elemental abundance ratio of similar to 0.8, provided that the sulphur abundance be depleted by a factor greater than 2. The ortho-to-para ratio of H-2 in these models is similar to 10(-3). Our models also provide predictions for the ortho-to-para ratios of NH2 and NH3 of similar to 2.3 and similar to 0.7, respectively. We conclude that the abundances of nitrogen hydrides in dark cloud conditions are consistent with the gas-phase synthesis predicted with our new chemical network.									69	0	0	0	1	0	69			1432-0746			WOS:000332161800060

This reaction is widely considered to proceed in a sequential pathway with four stepwise hydroxide-coupled hole transfer steps, resulting in oxidized surface intermediates that trap holes while their adsorbates change forms (e.g., from -OH to =O to -OOH and back to -OH) so as to maintain charge neutrality. Here we study the potentiodynamic discharge characteristics of hematite photoanodes following polarization under water photo-oxidation conditions. Upon turning the Eight off, some of the oxidized intermediates discharge spontaneously whereas others remain oxidized for a while. The metastable intermediates discharge in a double-peak wave during cathodic potential sweep (in the dark). The relative peak heights were found to reverse after Long time delays since turning the Eight off. This unexpected observation indicates that the discharge proceeds in parallel pathways, suggesting the same for the reverse reaction that Leads to water photo-oxidation. Complementary photoelectrochemical impedance spectroscopy measurements display distinct charge transfer features, supporting the prevalence of parallel pathways in the water photo-oxidation reaction. Through a micro-kinetic model, we derive a criterion that explains why peak reversal, as observed in our measurements, can emerge only from parallel pathways. The prevalence of parallel pathways fundamentally broadens the current paradigm of the water photo-oxidation reaction mechanism, and it may inspire new strategies to reduce the high overpotential of this reaction so as to enhance the efficiency of solar fuel production.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1754-5692	1754-5706		WOS:000789210000001		
J	Galyamova, Aigerim; Crooks, Richard M.								Effect of Intermediate Semiconducting TiOx Thin Films on Nanoparticle-Mediated Electron Transfer: Electrooxidation of CO								NANOMATERIALS				12	5					855	10.3390/nano12050855				MAR 2022	2022	The concept of nanoparticle-mediated electron transfer (eT) across insulating thin films was elucidated theoretically by Allongue and Chazalviel in 2011. In their model, metal nanoparticles (NPs) are immobilized atop passivating, self-assembled monolayers (SAMs). They found that under certain conditions, related to the thickness of the SAM and the size of the NPs, efficient faradaic oxidation and reduction reactions could proceed at the NP surface. In the absence of NPs, however, eT was suppressed by the insulating SAM thin films. Allongue and Chazalviel concluded that, within certain bounds, eT is mediated by fast tunneling between the conductive electrode and the metal NPs, while the kinetics of the redox reaction are controlled by the NPs. This understanding has been confirmed using a variety of experimental models. The theory is based on electron tunneling; therefore, the nature of the intervening medium (the insulator in prior studies) should not affect the eT rate. In the present manuscript, however, we show that the theory breaks down under certain electrochemical conditions when the medium between conductors is an n-type semiconductor. Specifically, we find that in the presence of either Au or Pt NPs immobilized on a thin film of TiOx, CO electrooxidation does not proceed. In contrast, the exact same systems lead to the efficient reduction of oxygen. At present, we are unable to explain this finding within the context of the model of Allongue and Chazalviel.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1				2079-4991		WOS:000768915300001	35269345

Herein reported is water oxidation catalysis of two cobalt complexes [Co(tpbn)](ClO4)(2) (1) and [Co(tpen)](ClO4)(2)center dot 3CH(3)CN (2) of tetrapyridyl ligands N,N,N',N'-tetrakis(2-pyridyl-methyl)-1,4-butanediamine (tpbn) and N,N,N',N'-tetrakis(2-pyridyl-methyl)-1,2-ethanediamine (tpen). 1 was a stable molecular electrocatalyst for WOR in alkaline solutions with a rate constant (k(cat)) of 0.97 s(-1). A turnover number (TON) was estimated to be 10. Complex 2 was a much weaker catalyst than 1. The difference in the catalytic activity of 1 and 2 could be due to the flexibility of the coordination sphere of the Co center. The Co-N bonds in 1 were longer than those in 2. In comparison to the five-membered ring (N-C-2-N-Co) in 2, a seven-membered ring (N-C-4-N-Co) in 1 was more flexible and easily adaptive for the incoming H2O or OH - groups to access the Co center, which was vital for the formation of O-2. A nucleophilic attack catalytic mechanism was proposed for WOR. This work demonstrated that the flexibility of the organic ligands and the adaptability of the coordination configuration of the metal center had a great impact on the catalytic properties of metal complexes.

However, the interpretation of the structure-reactivity relationship caused by different crystal types of carriers and the metal-support interface is not well understood. Herein we synthesized ZrO2 -supported Cu nanoparticle catalysts via different preparation methods and reduction temperatures under similarly exposed surface facets and Cu valency but different polymorphic phases of ZrO2 (monoclinic ZrO2: m-ZrO2; tetragonal ZrO2: t-ZrO2) and the metal-support interface. Interestingly, the as-synthesized Cu/t-ZrO2 catalysts showed remarkably better catalytic performance than Cu/m-ZrO2 for the in situ hydrogenation of lauric acid in the methanol-water system. Combined experimental and density functional theory (DFT) calculation results ascribed the lower efficiency of m-ZrO2 as a carrier to weakly adsorbed reactant and intermediate molecules as well as the absence of an oxygen vacancy in the crystal phase. The interface-rich Cu/t-ZrO2 catalysts displayed higher activity normalized to the surface-exposed Cu sites toward lauryl alcohol production than the interface-deficient counterparts. DFT calculation results further revealed that this metal-support interface plays an important role in promoting the C-O bond or H-H bond cleavage in two possible reaction routes, thus reducing the activation barrier of the overall reaction.									19	0	0	0	1	0	19			2155-5435			WOS:000563749900011

Building on decades of knowledge in colloidal chemistry, researchers have created notable high-performance, low-cost energy conversion catalysts. However, in almost all cases, controlling the surface chemistry-in particular, removing the surfactants used during the syntheses-is a challenge. Aggressive physical treatments, such as thermal pyrolysis and plasma etching, have become the methods of choice, but these processes test the material's phase and chemical stability. In this work, we analyze softer methods to postsynthetically remove surfactants using chemical treatments. We performed various surface treatments to deprotect colloidal nanocrystals of a well-known electrocatalyst, manganese oxide (Mn3O4), passivated with hydrophobic ligands. We employed a suite of characterization techniques (transmission electron microscopy, infrared spectroscopy, voltammetry, and thermogravimetric analysis) to evaluate their surface chemistry. Although the four studied treatments (bases, alkylating agents, Lewis acids, or heat) could remove nearly all organic ligands, the surface chemistries of the treated nanomaterials differed significantly from treatment to treatment. These chemical differences arise from the reactions between the treatment agent and the surfactant or from side reactions of the agent with atmospheric water or carbon dioxide, leaving behind residues, such as hydrolyzed ligand removal agent, metal hydroxide, and metal carbonate, on the surface. From our study, we find that treatment using alkylating agents is the most promising approach for soft room-temperature stripping of nanocrystal ligands, producing Mn3O4 with the highest electrochemical activity.									17	0	0	0	2	0	17				2639-4979		WOS:000519669700028

In this study, a reduced graphene oxide modified nickel foam electrode (GR-Ni foam) was facilely prepared via one-step cyclic voltammetry electrodeposition of graphene oxide suspension onto the Ni foam. The electrochemical degradation of nitrofuranzone (NFZ, a kind of typical antibiotics) was studied on the GR-Ni foam cathode. The cyclic voltammetry and electrochemical impedance spectra analysis confirmed that presence of GR loading accelerated the electron transfer from the cathode surface to NFZ. With the applied cathode potential of -1.25 V (vs. Ag/AgCl), the removal efficiency of NFZ (C-0 = 20 mg L-1) at the GR-Ni foam electrode reached up to 99 % within 30 min, showing a higher reaction rate constant (0.1297 min(-1)) than 0.0870 min(-1) at the Pd-Ni foam and 0.0186 min(-1) at the Ni foam electrode. It was also found that the pH, dissolved oxygen and NFZ initial concentration have slight effect on NFZ degradation at the GR-Ni foam electrode. The reactions first occurred at nitro groups (-NO2), unsaturated C=N bonds and N-N bonds to generate furan ring-containing products, and then these products were transformed into linear diamine products. The direct reduction by electrons was mainly responsible for NFZ reduction at the GR-Ni foam electrode. Even after 18 cycles, the removal efficiency of NFZ still reached up to 98 % within 1 h. In addition, the cathodic degradation process could eliminate the antibacterial activity of NFZ. The GR-Ni foam electrode would have a great potential in electrochemical process for treating wastewater containing furan antibiotics.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			1847-9286			WOS:000419148300005

The results show that the combustion process of asphalt binder consists of three main consecutive stages at a low heating rate. The combustion reaction becomes more and more intense from the 1st to 3rd stage. The release of volatiles occurs mainly at 300-570 degrees C, and the gaseous products in each stage are different. The main products in the 1st stage are CO2, CO, H2O, hydrocarbons, formaldehyde, tetrahydrofuran, formic acid, aromatic compounds, etc. In the next stage, the combustion products mentioned above keep on increasing, but some new volatiles such as alcohols, phenols, styrene, etc. are present. In the last stage, the C-H and C-O bonds continue to fracture and aromatization reaction occurs, and the release amount of CO2, CO, and H2O reaches the maximum. But the content of other products decreases or even disappears due to burning. Among the above volatiles, CO2 is the dominant gaseous product in the whole combustion process. The concentration of CO2 and CO keeps increasing, and reaches the maximum intensity at about 520 degrees C. The evolution of H2O, CH4, and formic acid exhibits the trend of increase first, and then decrease. Over 570 degrees C, there are few products released at the end of the combustion process.

The effects of the deposition time and voltage, and of the calcination temperature have been investigated. The microstructure of the deposited films in the electrodes before and after calcination has also been investigated. The electrocatalytic properties of the electrodes have been investigated using cyclic voltammetry and polarization curves. The electrode films produced using this new technique have a porous structure composed of stacked hexagonal NiCo2O4 nanosheets.

J	Kato, Kengo; Ono, Hideki								Effect of Ratio of Scrap to Iron Source on Slag-Metal Reaction at the Bottom of Blast Furnace and Packed Bed Type Partial Smelting Reduction Furnace								ISIJ INTERNATIONAL				61	12			2979	2990		10.2355/isijinternationaLISIJINT-2021-281				2021	2021	With the depletion of high-grade iron ore and increase in amount of steel scrap, a new ironmaking process utilizing both low-grade iron ore and/or steel scrap is required. The blast furnace and packed bed type partial smelting reduction process (PSR) are the most prospective reactors. When steel scrap is used as an iron source, the hot metal composition should be precisely controlled, because tramp elements such as Cu, Sn, Ni, and Cr are dissolved in hot metal. An analysis model was developed to simulate the equilibrium of the slag metal reaction at the bottom of such reactors. The effect of scrap ratio (iron mass ratio of scrap to scrap and sinter) on hot metal and molten slag composition was thermodynamically analyzed and the optimal composition of hot metal under controlled temperature and Po, was investigated. Si and Mn were found to be significantly oxidized relative to the equilibrium state, and the S content was equal to that at equilibrium under a blast furnace condition. As the scrap ratio increased, the Si, Mn, and P contents decreased. The Si content decreased to 0.1 mass% at T = 1 773 K and P-o2 > 10(-1)3 atm or at P-o2 = 3.03 x10(-15) atm and T < 1 690 K, whereas the phosphorus content decreased at 1 773 K and P-o2 > 10(-12) atm when the scrap ratio was 0.5. PSR is expected to produce hot metal with a low impurity content by controlling the oxygen partial pressure at the bottom of the furnace.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0915-1559	1347-5460		WOS:000738077200015

Here, we report a modular materials design leading to noble metal-free composite electrocatalysts, which combine high electrical conductivity, high OER and HER reactivity and high durability. The scalable bottom-up fabrication allows the stable deposition of mixed metal oxide nanostructures with different functionalities on copper foam electrodes. The composite catalyst shows sustained OER and HER activity in 0.1M aqueous KOH over prolonged periods (t > 10 h) at low overpotentials (OER: approximate to 300 mV; HER: approximate to 100 mV) and high faradaic efficiencies (OER: approximate to 100%, HER: approximate to 98%). The new synthetic concept will enable the development of multifunctional, mixed metal oxide composites as high-performance electrocatalysts for challenging energy conversion and storage reactions.									117	2	0	0	3	0	117			1433-7851	1521-3773		WOS:000462622700033	30731028

The effect of phosphorus on the corrosion behavior of amorphous Fe-8Cr-13P-7B alloy investigated by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and its kinetics								Journal of the Korean Institute of Metals and Materials				35	3			346	50						March 1997	1997	The corrosion rate of amorphous Fe-8Cr-13P-7B alloy is significantly low in comparison with that of Fe-8Cr-20B alloy, showing that the addition of phosphorus to the amorphous Fe-8Cr alloy is quite effective in increasing the corrosion resistance. Elemental phosphorus was accumulated on the alloy surface during the initial active dissolution. The formation of elemental phosphorus layer accelerates the cathodic reaction of hydrogen evolution and oxygen reduction and also suppresses the active current density. This leads to sharp ennoblement in the corrosion potential of Fe-8Cr-13P-7B alloy from the active state to the passive state with immersion time, while the corrosion potential of Fe-8Cr-20B alloy is unchanged.									0	0	0		0	0	0			0253-3847			INSPEC:5683094

Triphenylphosphine modification of HKUST-1 followed by controlled calcination resulted in a phosphorus doped carbon/Cu2O composite (HKUST-1-P-300). The structure and band properties were fully studied, and phenol degradation and H-2 evolution were employed to evaluate the photocatalytic activity. Under visible light irradiation, HKUST-1-P-300 showed superior photocatalytic activity and stability. A phenol degradation efficiency of up to 99.8% was achieved within 90 minutes, and also a remarkable H-2 evolution rate of 1208 mol was achieved. The external quantum efficiency of solar hydrogen evolution over this photocatalyst, without noble metal loading, reaches 48.6% at 425 nm. More auspiciously, the photocatalytic reaction continued for more than 12 h without performance degradation. To get further evidence for the origin of the improved photocatalytic activity of the HKUST-1-P-300, a series of characterization studies have been carried out. To the best of our knowledge, this work represents the first example of using P-doped carbon/Cu2O both for phenol degradation and H-2 production. Mechanistic studies were carried out to give insights into the photodegradation process, and the superior photocatalytic activity of HKUST-1-P-300 can be ascribed to enhanced visible light absorption efficiency, higher surface area, efficient separation of photogenerated charge carriers, reduced aggregation of Cu2O and the synergistic effect of the P-doped carbon/Cu2O structures. This work demonstrates a facile and promising approach for designing low cost, highly stable and efficient heterostructured photocatalysts that can be applicable for energy and environmental applications.									36	3	0	0	5	0	37			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000463970400015

Sirohaem is synthesized from the central tetrapyrrole intermediate uroporphyrinogen III by methylation, oxidation and ferrochelation reactions. In Arabidopsis thaliana, the ferrochelation step is catalysed by sirohydrochlorin ferrochelatase (SirB), which, unlike its counterparts in bacteria, contains an [Fe S] cluster. We determined the cluster to be a [4Fe-4S] type, which quickly oxidizes to a [2Fe-2S] form in the presence of oxygen. We also identified the cluster ligands as four conserved cysteine residues located at the C-terminus. A fifth conserved cysteine residue, Cys(135), is not involved in ligating the cluster directly, but influences the oxygen-sensitivity of the [4Fe-4S] form, and possibly the affinity for the substrate metal. Substitution mutants of the enzyme lacking the Fe-S cluster or Cys(135) retain the same specific activity in vitro and dimeric quaternary structure as the wild-type enzyme. The mutant variants also rescue a defined Escherichia coli sirohaem-deficient mutant. However, the mutant enzymes cannot complement Arabidopsis plants with a null AtSirB mutation, which exhibits post-germination arrest. These observations suggest an important physiological role for the Fe-S cluster in planta, highlighting the close association of iron, sulfur and tetrapyrrole metabolism.									12	0	0	0	11	0	13			0264-6021	1470-8728		WOS:000304643200009	22414210	
J	Yu, Yunqing; Assmann, Sarah M.								Inter-relationships between the heterotrimeric G beta subunit AGB1, the receptor-like kinase FERONIA, and RALF1 in salinity response								PLANT CELL AND ENVIRONMENT				41	10			2475	2489		10.1111/pce.13370				OCT 2018	2018	Plant heterotrimeric G proteins modulate numerous developmental stress responses. Recently, receptor-like kinases (RLKs) have been implicated as functioning with G proteins and may serve as plant G-protein-coupled-receptors. The RLK FERONIA (FER), in the Catharantus roseus RLK1-like subfamily, is activated by a family of polypeptides called rapid alkalinization factors (RALFs). We previously showed that the Arabidopsis G protein beta subunit, AGB1, physically interacts with FER, and that RALF1 regulation of stomatal movement through FER requires AGB1. Here, we investigated genetic interactions of AGB1 and FER in plant salinity response by comparing salt responses in the single and double mutants of agb1 and fer. We show that AGB1 and FER act additively or synergistically depending on the conditions of the NaCl treatments. We further show that the synergism likely occurs through salt-induced ROS production. In addition, we show that RALF1 enhances salt toxicity through increasing Na+ accumulation and decreasing K+ accumulation rather than by inducing ROS production, and that the RALF1 effect on salt response occurs in an AGB1-independent manner. Our results indicate that RLK epistatic relationships are not fixed, as AGB1 and FER display different genetic relationships to RALF1 in stomatal versus salinity responses.									25	3	0	0	22	0	25			0140-7791	1365-3040		WOS:000445199900020	29907954

We tested hypotheses on the relationship between species richness and environmental conditions including environmental extremes, nutrient status, and day length. On the basis of the unique environment that exists in these high-latitude lakes, we expected that novel taxa would be present. Alpha diversity analyses showed that extreme conditions-that is, high salinity, low oxygen, and extreme changes in day length-did not impact ciliate richness; however, ciliate richness was 30% higher in samples with higher dissolved organic matter. Beta diversity analyses revealed that ciliate communities clustered by dissolved oxygen, depth, and salinity, but not by season (i.e., day length). The permutational analysis of variance test indicated that depth, dissolved oxygen, and salinity had significant influences on the ciliate community for the abundance matrices of resampled data, while lake and season were not significant. This result suggests that the vertical trends in dissolved oxygen concentration and salinity may play a critical role in structuring ciliate communities. A PCR-based strategy capitalizing on divergent eukaryotic V9 hypervariable region ribosomal RNA gene targets unveiled two new genera in these lakes. A novel taxon belonging to an unknown class most closely related to Cryptocaryon irritans was also inferred from separate gene phylogenies.									10	0	0	0	10	0	10			0006-3185	1939-8697		WOS:000345447800008	25411375

In contrast, aluminum metal is known as the cleanest and cheapest source for hydrogen production because of its 3(+) oxidation state and spontaneous exothermic reaction with water molecules. In this work, we report the hydrothermal synthesis of hybrid Cu2S decorated on nickel foam (NF) for direct aluminum fuel cell application. The hybrid structure of the Cu2S nanoflake- and nanosphere-based catalyst distributed on the three-dimensional (3D) skeletal NF is revealed via detailed structural analysis. The Cu2S/NF-8 catalyst electrode exhibits a maximum mass activity of 106.7 mA/mg at an overpotential of 0.8 V (vs Hg/HgO) for a 40 mg Al source. The high mass activity of the optimized Cu2S/NF-8 catalyst electrode is attributed to the hybrid Cu2S structure, which facilitates improved electrocatalytic activity via its point defects and metallic edges. Likewise, the high electrical conductivity, chemical stability, and rapid charge transfer at the electrode with a short diffusion path are because of the arrangements of the hybrid Cu2S on the NF substrate. The stability and real-time performance of the Cu2S/NF-8 catalyst electrode is successfully studied via chronoamperometry in the presence of an Al ball and a scrap aluminum source. The electrode exhibits a capacity retention of similar to 60% (for 7000 s; Al ball) and similar to 35% (for 100000 s; scrap Al). This proves the Cu2S/NF-8 catalyst electrode as a promising platform for aluminum source-based fuel cell applications.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2574-0962			WOS:000835205100001

The range of potentials of the investigations performed has been confined to the region of rhodium electrochemical oxidation/reduction, i.e., 0.2 < E < 1.2 V (RHE) in order to prevent any possible interference of other reactions such as H-2 and O-2 evolution. It has been shown that rhodium electrode with a layer of surface compounds formed anodically at E much less than 1.23 V (RHE) behaves like a reversible metal-oxide electrode within the range of pH values from ca. 1.0 to ca. 8.0. It has been presumed that the stationary potential of such electrode is determined by the equilibrium of the following electrochemical reaction:Rh + 3H(2)O double left right arrow Rh(OH)(3) + 3H(+) + 3e(-).The pH-dependence of the reversible potential of E-Rh/Rh(OH)3 electrode has been found to be:E-Rh/Rh(OH)3 E-i=0(st) = 0.69 - 0.059 pH, V.In acid solutions (pH < 2.0) rhodium hydroxide dissolves into the electrolyte, therefore, to reach equilibrium, the solution must be saturated with Rh(OH)(3). This has been achieved by adding Rh3+ ions in the form of Rh-2(SO4)(3), The solubility product of Rh(OH)(3), estimated from the experimental E-Rh/Rh(OH)3 - pH dependence obtained, is ca. 1.0 x 10(-48), which is close to the value given in literature.									4	0	0	0	1	0	4			1040-0397	1521-4109		WOS:000224517400010

Here, a huge improvement of surface charge transfer efficiency (eta(surface)) of BiVO4 photoanode was achieved by surface modification of oxygen vacancy-abundant carbon quantum dots (O-V-CQDs), in which the O-V-CQDs serve as superfast hole transport channel for the fact that the abundant O-V in O-V-CQDs could induce the outward driving force for hole trapping and migration at electrode/electrolyte interface. The O-V-CQDs/BiVO4 shows the eta(surface) value of 74.3% at 0.65 V vs. RHE (V-RHE), which is 7.1 and 3.3 times higher than BiVO4 and CQDs/BiVO4, respectively. Besides, the O-V-CQDs efficiently promote the bulk charge separation and UV-vis light harvesting of BiVO4. Therefore, the O-V-CQDs/BiVO4 exhibits remarkable photocurrent densities of 2.76 mA cm(-2) at 0.65 V-RHE and 4.01 mA cm(-2) at 1.23 V-RHE, which are 12.5 and 3.4 times higher than BiVO4, 3.5 and 2.6 times higher than CQDs/BiVO4, respectively.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000819787200001

In the case of the high intensities used for light-driven water splitting, the interpretation is less straightforward since the electron transfer reactions are so slow that the minority carrier concentration at or near the surface increases to high values that modify the potential drop across the Helmholtz layer in the electrolyte, leading to 'band edge unpinning'. In addition, changes in chemical composition of the surface or local changes in pH may also alter the potential distribution across the semiconductor/electrolyte junction. A quantitative theory of band edge unpinning due to minority carrier build up is preseined, and numerical calculations of transient photocurrent responses are compared with experimental examples for n-type Fe2O3 and p-type lithium-doped CuO electrodes. It is shown that the apparently high reaction orders (up to third order) with respect to hole concentration reported for hematite photoanodes can be explained as arising from an acceleration of hole transfer by the increased voltage drop across the Helmholtz layer associated with band edge unpinning. The limitations of the band edge unpinning model are discussed considering additional effects associated with modification of the potential distribution brought about by light-induced changes in surface composition, surface dipoles and surface ionic charge.									22	0	0	0	3	0	21			1572-6657	1873-2569		WOS:000575156800020

Numerical study on transition structures of oblique detonations with expansion wave from finite-length cowl								PHYSICS OF FLUIDS				32	5					056108	10.1063/5.0005189				MAY 1 2020	2020	The oblique detonation wave (ODW) triggered by a semi-infinite cowl or wedge has been widely studied, but the effects of finite-length cowls require further clarification to enhance their applicability. Based on two-dimensional inviscid Euler equations and a two-step induction-reaction model, two structures with smooth and abrupt transitions are simulated, and their interactions with the cowl-induced expansion wave are investigated. The expansion waves located downstream and far away from the initiation zone do not affect the macroscopic structures of the ODW. However, when the expansion waves move upstream, the structures evolve into a decoupled shock and a reactive front. Alongside findings from previous studies, these results indicate that the initiation mechanism, rather than the transition type, determines the near-quenching evolution of the structure. Moreover, given the same parameter settings for the chemical and inflow gas dynamics, these numerical results show that the abrupt transition evolves into a smooth transition under an expansion wave disturbance. This demonstrates that the local wave interaction plays a key role in the ODW structures.									63	2	0	0	3	0	63			1070-6631	1089-7666		WOS:000536214500001

Yunyan87. The results showed that the fast chlorophyll fluorescence induction dynamics curve (OJIP) changed under cadmium stress, and both the minimum fluorescence value(F_o) and maximum fluorescence value (F_m) significantly decreased. Under cadmium stress, the maximum photochemical efficiency (F_v/F_m), oxygen evolution complex (OEC), receptor library capacity (S_m), quantum yield for electron transport (phi_(Eo)), density of reaction centers (RC/CS_o) and performance index (PI_(abs)) decreased. While the relative variable fluorescence at K-step (V_k), the relative variable fluorescence at J-step (V_J) and approximated initial slope of the fluorescence transient (M_o) significantly increased. These data indicated that cadmium stress damaged tobacco leaf's photosynthetic integrity, altered the quantity of per PS Ⅱ reaction centers and the harmfulness to donor- and acceptor-side of PS Ⅱ and inhibited photosynthetic electron transmission. The fluorescence kinetic curves of Cd_(0.05)+Si and Cd_(0.10)+Si treatments coincided with that of the control. OEC, S_m, phi_(Eo), RC/CS_o and PI_(abs) were significantly increased, while V_k, V_J and M_o significantly decreased.

F.; Schloegl, Robert; Frei, Elias								Evolution of zincian malachite synthesis by low temperature co-precipitation and its catalytic impact on the methanol synthesis								APPLIED CATALYSIS B-ENVIRONMENTAL				249				218	226		10.1016/j.apcatb.2019.02.023				JUL 15 2019	2019	Low temperature co-precipitation enabled, for the first time, the preparation of phase pure zincian malachite precursors with Zn contents of up to 31 at.-%. The high Zn content was beneficial for maximizing the dispersion of Cu and oxygen defect sites on the ZnO surface. Further, an increase of the Zn loading from 10 to 31 at.-% doubled the specific surface areas obtained from N2O-RFC (Reactive Frontal Chromatography) and H-2-TA (Transient Adsorption). As the Zn content was increased from 10 to 31 at.-%, the apparent activation energy for methanol formation was strongly decreased. Furthermore, water formation was reduced indicating a retardation of the rWGS in favor of methanol formation at high Zn loadings. Additionally, compared to high temperature co-precipitation, low temperature precipitated catalysts exhibited increased catalytic activities.									28	0	0	0	1	0	28			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000464487500021

Part II: Organic matter evolution, magnetic susceptibility and metals (Ti, Cr, Fe) at the Khushaym Matruk natural analogue (Central Jordan)								APPLIED GEOCHEMISTRY				22	7			1311	1328		10.1016/j.apgeochem.2007.02.013				JUL 2007	2007	Spontaneous combustion, less than I Ma ago, affected a 60-m thick sediment pile of biomicrite at the Khushaym Matruck site (Jordan). The present study shows that three retrograde alteration stages occurred: weathering, thermal stress and oxidative alkaline perturbation. mu-FT-i.r. spectra of isolated kerogens and oxygen index of whole rocks indicate that oxidation of organic matter occurred down to similar to 10 m beneath the metamorphosed zone at Khushaym Matruck. The occurrence of the oxidative weathering bacterially mediated, as suggested by the mass chromatograms of saturated hydrocarbons, can explain high Rock-Eval T-max values and low petroliferous potential measured along the sedimentary pile. On the other hand, the thermal extent of combustion events was limited to the first 2 m from the contact. The mean reflectance of 0.20-0.24% and porosity of ca. 50% of the grey clayey biomicrites indicate that organic matter was very immature and sediments were unconsolidated at the time of the combustion event. Using mineralogy, microscopic analyses of vegetable debris and magnetic susceptibility, a suite of characteristic points corresponding to the thermal imprint can be assessed: (i) x = 0m, T similar to 1000 degrees C, (ii) x = 1m, T similar to 350 degrees C, (iii) x = 2m, T similar to 150 degrees C and (iv) x > similar to 8 m, T similar to 30 degrees C. Paleocirculation of meteoric groundwater in the 'cement-marbles' generated high-pH fluids that have circulated via fractures and through the matrix porosity of the underlying biomicrites but have also induced alkaline hydrolysis and oxidative attack of the organic matter. The polysaccharide/lignin ratio derived from mu-FT-i.r. analyses shows that the delignification of vegetable debris and degradation of polysaccharides progressively decline in the indurated zone, which indicates a decrease in the pH of migrating solutions. The latter, also severely oxidized organic matter at 2. 10 and 3.05 in as revealed by the oxygen index and induced the generation of bitumen. The spatial correlation between the oxidation levels of organic matter and the metal contents (Fe, Ti and Cr) suggests that redox reactions were responsible for the immobilization of metals in the indurated biomicrites. The intensity of these reactions is attributed to changes in the fluid flow regime within the sedimentary column. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Hazen, Robert M.; Morrison, Shaunna M.								An evolutionary system of mineralogy. Part I: Stellar mineralogy (> 13 to 4.6 Ga)								AMERICAN MINERALOGIST				105	5			627	651		10.2138/am-2020-7173				MAY 2020	2020	Minerals preserve records of the physical, chemical, and biological histories of their origins and subsequent alteration, and thus provide a vivid narrative of the evolution of Earth and other worlds through billions of years of cosmic history. Mineral properties, including trace and minor elements, ratios of isotopes, solid and fluid inclusions, external morphologies, and other idiosyncratic attributes, represent information that points to specific modes of formation and subsequent environmental histories-information essential to understanding the co-evolving geosphere and biosphere. This perspective suggests an opportunity to amplify the existing system of mineral classification, by which minerals are defined solely on idealized end-member chemical compositions and crystal structures. Here we present the first in a series of contributions to explore a complementary evolutionary system of mineralogy-a classification scheme that links mineral species to their paragenetic modes.The earliest stage of mineral evolution commenced with the appearance of the first crystals in the universe at >13 Ga and continues today in the expanding, cooling atmospheres of countless evolved stars, which host the high-temperature (T > 1000 K), low-pressure (P < 10(-2) atm) condensation of refractory minerals and amorphous phases. Most stardust is thought to originate in three distinct processes in carbon- and/or oxygen-rich mineral-forming stars: (1) condensation in the cooling, expanding atmospheres of asymptotic giant branch stars; (2) during the catastrophic explosions of supernovae, most commonly core collapse (Type II) supernovae; and (3) classical novae explosions, the consequence of runaway fusion reactions at the surface of a binary white dwarf star. Each stellar environment imparts distinctive isotopic and trace element signatures to the micro- and nanoscale stardust grains that are recovered from meteorites and micrometeorites collected on Earth's surface, by atmospheric sampling, and from asteroids and comets. Although our understanding of the diverse mineral-forming environments of stars is as yet incomplete, we present a preliminary catalog of 41 distinct natural kinds of stellar minerals, representing 22 official International Mineralogical Association (IMA) mineral species, as well as 2 as yet unapproved crystalline phases and 3 kinds of non-crystalline condensed phases not codified by the IMA.									15	0	0	0	1	0	15			0003-004X	1945-3027		WOS:000530656700005	33867541

The latter results in self-shading and a temporally declining growth rate, making the process inefficient. Upscaling phototrophic processes requires knowledge of the reaction kinetics with special attention on the -I relation. Model-based calculations for studying the effect of self-shading on growth were performed for three (I) concepts. The nonrealistic (I-0) concept results in exponential growth without limit, the widely used (I(x)) concept exhibits a growth behavior that significantly deviates from real processes, but the sophisticated (I(x) concept describes real processes best. A Respiration Activity Monitoring System (RAMOS) with CultiLux unit was tested regarding its applicability for exploring the -I dependency of Arthrospira platensis. The results were not satisfactory because of self-shading due to a high cell density (which was essential for yielding detectable oxygen-evolution signals). An innovative cultivation system in which self-shading does not interfere with phototrophic growth was required. A flat-panel system was constructed (designed by CFD, short light path of 1 cm, uniform planar light supply by LED and OLED units), allowing continuous cultivation of phototrophic microbes at varied light intensities.									7	0	0	0	6	0	7			1618-0240	1618-2863		WOS:000386156400003

J	Tamersit, Sabrina; Bouhidel, Kamel-Eddine								Treatment of tannery unhairing wastewater using carbon dioxide and zinc cations for greenhouse gas capture, pollution removal and water recycling								JOURNAL OF WATER PROCESS ENGINEERING				34						101120	10.1016/j.jwpe.2019.101120				APR 2020	2020	The aim of this study is to treat the tannery unhairing wastewaters (WW) issued from an important leather tanning plant, which is a large environmental threat and a severe industrial issue. High levels of pH, chemical oxygen demand (COD) mainly as alkaline proteins, conductivity, suspended solids and sulfide are the main characteristics of these highly polluted wastewaters. This study is based on the coupling of CO2 neutralization with Zn2+ precipitation. The use of CO2 leads to the neutralization of the WW alkalinities, and the precipitation of Ca2+ and COD to CaCO3 and solid proteins respectively, while Zn2+ leads to the precipitation of sulfide as ZnS avoiding any H2S gas evolution. The originality of this paper comes from the simultaneous capture of greenhouse gas, the removal of WW pollution, and the recycling of treated water. The pollutants removal efficiency is evident and can be seen through the decrease of pH from 13 to 6.5, a decrease in the conductivity from 8000 to 2000 mu S, and in COD from 20000 to 80000 to 3000 mg O-2 L-1, as well as obtaining pristine final water for recycling. In addition to the simplicity and cost-effectiveness of these results, the kinetics of the CO2 and Zn2+ reactions is instantaneous, contrary to the conventional biological slow process and the catalytic sulfide oxidation reaction. CO2 and Zn2+ have never been studied as a treatment method for tannery WW. This will open promising perspectives for industrial applications.									10	0	0	0	3	1	10			2214-7144			WOS:000517603300015

Recently, it was shown that Al-doped SrTiO3 microparticles prepared by flux-mediated solid-state reaction catalyze OWS with an apparent quantum efficiency of 30% at 360nm, the highest value reported so far for strontium titanate. However, the roles of Al3+ and of the particle morphology in controlling the activity are not clear. Here we report a new synthetic route to well defined nanocrystals of Al:SrTiO3 with controllable Al-concentration (3-8 atom%) using TiO2, Sr(OH)(2) and Al(NO3)(3) as starting materials. X-Ray diffraction and transmission electron microscopy confirm the presence of perovskite-type cubic nanoparticles with size of 60 nm. After loading with a Rh2-yCryO3 cocatalyst, nano-Al:SrTiO3 catalyzes OWS under UV/vis illumination from a Xe lamp. The activity shows a volcano-like dependence on Al concentration, confirming that Al3+ content is a key factor for the activity. Nanocrystals doped with 7.2 atom% Al show the activity of 53 mol H-2 per hour under 240 mW cm(-2) UV illumination and an AQE of 0.06% at 375 nm. Based on surface photovoltage spectroscopy (SPS), aluminum enhances photochemical charge separation in the Al:SrTiO3 nanocrystals and reduces electron and hole trapping. However, under UV/vis illumination, the Al:SrTiO3 nanocrystals are found to be 40 times less active than Al:SrTiO3 microparticles made by flux reaction in SrCl2. The lower activity of the nanoparticles is due to optical shielding from the Rh2-yCryO3 co-catalyst.									15	0	0	0	1	0	15			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000443272700024		
J	Zelinsky, A. G.; Pirogov, B. Ya.								Electrochemical oxidation of sulfite and sulfur dioxide at a renewable graphite electrode								ELECTROCHIMICA ACTA				231				371	378		10.1016/j.electacta.2017.02.070				MAR 20 2017	2017	Electrochemical oxidation of S(IV) species which are present in the aqueous solutions of sodium sulfite or are formed during the dissolution of gaseous sulfur dioxide was studied on a renewable graphite electrode as the dependence on the concentration of these particles, electrode potential and pH of solution. The voltammograms in acid and alkaline sulfite solutions have different shapes. In acid solutions, this is a voltammograms with a sole maximum of current near 1.0 V. In alkaline solutions, this is a curve with two maxima; the first of them appears around 0.6 V, while the second one is near 1.0 V, similarly to the case of acid solutions. Analysis of the behavior of j-E curves and calculations of the equilibrium composition of the solution indicate that the maximum of current near 0.6 V is connected with the oxidation of SO32- ions. The maximum of current near 1.0 V is mainly due to the oxidation of HSO3- ions which are present in acid solutions in bulk, while in alkaline solutions they might be formed in the near-electrode layer of solution as a product of the chemical reaction that follows the reaction of oxidation of sulfite ions. The results give use reason to assume that acid or basic surface oxides that are formed on graphite surface participate not only in the processes of oxygen evolution on this electrode but also in the processes of oxidation of S(IV) species. Their participation causes substantial difference in the potentials of oxidation of the indicated particles in alkaline and acid solutions. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

The surface coverage of the nanofilm was characterized by ion transfer voltammetry. These gold nanoparticle films represent an ideal model system for studying both the thermodynamic and kinetic aspects of interfacial redox catalysis. The electric polarization of these soft interfaces is easily controllable, and thus the Fermi level of the electrons in the interfacial gold nanoparticle film can be easily manipulated. Here, we study interfacial redox catalysis between two redox couples located in adjacent immiscible phases and highlight the catalytic properties of a gold nanoparticle film toward heterogeneous electron transfer reactions.									55	0	0	0	3	0	55			1936-0851	1936-086X		WOS:000356988500099	26039934

The present study reveals the influence of several factors that affect the oxidative performance of the Au/ xCeO(2)/Al2O3 catalysts, such as the ceria loading, the catalyst activation method, i.e., the gold oxidation state, the gold particle size and the distribution of gold on ceria and alumina. The Au/xCeO(2)/Al2O3 catalysts were found 100% selective to CO2. Their activity was intermediate between that of Au/Al2O3 (Poorly active) and Au/CeO2 (active). Interestingly, the activity increased with the ceria loading when the samples were activated under H-2 at 300 degrees C, but decreased when they were activated under O-2 at 500 degrees C. Characterization of the Au/xCeO(2)/Al2O3 catalysts after both types of activation was performed by TEM, EFTEM, XPS and CO oxidation reaction. The results show that whatever the mode of activation, as the CeO2 loading increased, the proportion of gold particles on alumina decreased while that on ceria increased, but gold remained unreduced on ceria after calcination under O-2 whereas it was metallic after reduction under H-2. Gold on ceria being more active when it is metallic than when it is unreduced, this explained the evolution of the catalytic results of propene oxidation as the ceria loading varied.

On anodic polarization of Pb-Sb electrodes in H2SO4 these phases are oxidized forming PbSO4 and lead oxides: PbO, PbO(n), PbO2 as well as Pb1-xSb(x)O, Pb1-xSb(x)On, Pb1-xSb(x)O2. The potential regions of formation of the above phases have been determined through x-ray diffraction analysis as well as their stability and the effect of antimony on the boundaries of these potential regions. It has been established that antimony facilitates the appearance of a potential region between 0.8 and 1.2 (1.3) V in which nonstoichiometric Pb1-xSb(x)O(n) is formed. This leads to a shift in the potential of oxidation of PbSO4 to PbO2 from 1.0 V for Pb electrodes to 1.2 (1.3) V for Pb-Sb ones. The reason for the formation of Pb1-xSb(x)O(n) (which has the same crystal structure as that of tet-PbO or is amorphous) has been investigated. It has been established that antimony has a catalytic effect on the reaction PbO --> PbO(n) and slows down the rate of reaction PbO(n) --> PbO2. It has been proven experimentally that antimony increases the degree of hydration of lead dioxide from 10% (for Pb electrodes) to 30% (for Pb-20% Sb electrodes). This leads to the formation of elastic elements in the structure of the corrosion layer which, in their turn, reduce cracking of the corrosion layer.									29	2	0	0	1	0	31			0013-4651			WOS:A1994PG28600023

The role of surface states (SS) during water oxidation for the as prepared photoanodes was investigated by using electro-chemical, photoelectrochemical, and impedance spectroscopy measurements. An optimum 2% doping is observed in voltammetric measurements with the highest photocurrent density at 1.23 V-RHE under back side illumination. It has been found that a high PEC performance requires an optimum ratio of density of surface states (N-SS) with respect to the charge donor density (N-d), to give both good conductivity and enough surface reactive sites. The optimum doping (2%) shows the highest Nd and SS concentration, which leads to the high film conductivity and reactive sites. The reason for SS acting as reaction sites (i-SS) is suggested to be the reversible redox process of V5+/V4+ in semiconductor bulk to form water oxidation intermediates through the electron trapping process. Otherwise, the irreversible surface reductive reaction of VO2+ to VO2+ though the electron trapping process raises the surface recombination. W doping does have an effect on the surface properties of the BiVO4. electrode. It can tune the electron trapping process to obtain a high concentration of i-SS and less surface recombination.

Two different type of ZnO architectures viz., honeycomb (HON) and nanorods (NRs) were grown on the GaN layer by executing structure directing agents of multiwall carbon nanotubes, and ZnO buffer layer, enhancing photoelectrocatalytic (PEC) activity toward oxygen evolution reaction (OER). In an expansion of such approach, the PEC activity was further improved by incorporating photo-electrodeposited cobalt phosphate (CoPi) in synthesis system accompanying negative shift of the photocurrent onset potential. A steady-state and highest photocurrent density (J(ph)), of 4.81 +/- 0.02 mA/cm(2) was obtained with GaN/ZnO NRs/CoPi heterojunction cascade electrode at 1.23 V verses reversible hydrogen electrode (V-RHE) under simulated sunlight illumination. PL result shows quenching of photoluminescence with CoPi modification acts as co-catalyst and preferably captures hole from ZnO NRs which likely to facilitate the electron-hole (e(-)/h(+)) pair separation and OER reaction kinetics. However, CoPi modified GaN/ZnO HON and pristine GaN photoelectrodes exhibited relatively lesser photocurrent densities. Experimental evidences by electrochemical impedance (EIS) and incident photon to current conversion efficiency (IPCE) confirmed superior electrical conductivity, light absorption capability and charge transfer across GaN/ZnO NRs/CoPi heterojunction interfaces attributable to type II band alignment together with dominant synergistic effect of ZnO NRs nanostructures and CoPi oxidation co-catalyst which could augment PEC water splitting. This work encourages futuristic insights into integrated synthesis methods toward development of high performance photoelectrodes based on underexplored GaN and other heterostructures.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			0254-0584	1879-3312		WOS:000620395000004

In this work, the catalytic performance of NiO/NaCl for hydrogen production via autothermal reforming of ethyl acetate and water is further improved through lanthanum modification, and the resulted 3%-NiLaOy/NaCl catalyst achieves as high as 93% H-2 selectivity and long-term stability at 600 degrees C. The promoting effect is caused by the strong interactions between lanthanum and NiO/NaCl, by which LaNiO3 and a novel LaOCl phase are formed. The key role of LaOCl in promoting low-temperature hydrogen production is highlighted, while effects of LaNiO3 are well known. The LaOCl (010) facet possesses high adsorption capacity toward co-chemisorbing ethyl acetate and water. LaOCl strongly interacts with ethyl acetate and H2O in the form of hydrogen bonding and coordination effect. The interactions induce tensions inside ethyl acetate and H2O, activate the molecules, and hence decrease the energy barrier for reaction. In situ Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) reveals that LaOCl along with NaCl enhances the adsorption ability of NiO/NaCl. Moreover, LaOCl improves the dispersion of Ni species in NiO-LaNiO3-LaOCl nanosheets, which possess abundant active sites. The effects together promote hydrogen evolution. Furthermore, the NiLaOy/NaCl catalyst can be easily reborn after deactivation due to the water solubility of NaCl.									9	0	0	0	3	0	9			1613-6810	1613-6829		WOS:000442501500002	30028571

Such materials are growing in demand, but their corresponding monomers are often difficult to synthesize, giving rise to biocatalytic approaches. Here, we implemented cyclopentadecanone monooxygenase as an Escherichia coli whole-cell biocatalyst in a defined medium, together with a substrate feeding-product removal concept, and an optimized downstream processing (DSP). A previously described hazardous peracid-mediated oxidation was thus replaced with a safe and scalable protocol, using aerial oxygen as oxidant, and water as reaction solvent. The engineered process converted 42g (0.28mol) starting material ketone to the corresponding lactone with an isolated yield of 70% (33g), after highly efficient DSP with 95% recovery of the converted material, translating to a volumetric yield of 8g pure product per liter.

Due to their excellent redox properties and stability, POM clusters can serve as ligands and supports for constructing single-atom catalysts (SACs) with atomic-precision structures, where the coordination states and loading of active sites can be controlled precisely. Metal-substituted POM clusters are also promising candidates to act as sub-nanometer building blocks, where neoteric morphologies and enhanced catalytic properties have been obtained using these cluster-based assemblies. Moreover, POM-based single-atom catalysts display the advantages of both heterogeneous and homogeneous catalysts, in addition to excellent solubility and reusability. This perspective summarizes recent progress relating to polyoxometalate-based single-atom catalysts, including the synthesis and applications of metal-substituted POM clusters and the use of cluster-based assemblies as single-atom catalysts. Future research directions and challenges are also expounded upon, and this work may allow a comprehensive understanding of and novel insights into cluster-based single-atom catalysts.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000727448800001

The sludge presented a much better dye decolorizing ability than that of different individual strains. A broad spectrum of dyes could be decolorized by the sludge. Continuous decolorization tests showed that the sludge exhibited the ability to decolorize repeated additions of dye. The chemical oxygen demand (COD) removal rate of the dye wastewater reached 52% after 12 h of incubation. Polymerase chain reaction and denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (PCR-DGGE) profiles revealed that the microbial community changed as a result of varying initial concentrations of dyes. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that microbial populations in the sludge belonged to the phyla Acidobacteria, Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes, Chloroflexi and Proteobacteria. The degradation products of the three types of dye were identified. For azo dyes, the anaerobic sludge converted Methyl Orange to N,N-dimethylbenzene-1,4-diamine and 4-aminobenzenesulfonic acid; for triphenylmethane dyes, after Malachite Green was decolorized, the analyzed products were found to be a mixture of N,N-dimethylbenzenamine, 3-dimethyl-aminophenol and 4-dimethylaminobenzophenone; for anthraquinone dyes, two products (acetophenone and 2-methylbenzoic acid) were observed after Reactive Blue 19 decolorization. Together, these results suggest that the anaerobic sludge has promising potential for use in the treatment of industrial wastewater containing various types of dyes.									21	2	0	0	13	0	22				1660-4601		WOS:000389571300012	27801853

The acid treatment has no effect on the textural and redox properties of the materials when Mn is stabilized in a MnOx-CeO2 solid solution (Mn content below 50%). However, these properties were found to be highly altered by acid treatment when the solubility limit of Mn in the ceria was exceeded (Mn content above 50%). This enabled access to the primary porosity and oxidized the manganese species to a higher oxidation state via a Mn dismutation reaction. As a result, the catalytic activity of pure manganese oxide, after chemical activation, in the oxidation of formaldehyde is greatly improved-at 100 degrees C, the conversion of formaldehyde is increased by a factor of 5 and the corresponding intrinsic reaction rate by 1.4. Combined in situ surface analysis unambiguously identified formate species as a result of formaldehyde oxidation at room temperature on the chemically activated pure MnOx. The evolution of various surface species was monitored by increasing the temperature and in situ FTIR, and XPS results provided direct evidence of the desorption of monodentate formate species into formaldehyde and the oxidation of bidentate-bridging formate species. Changes in the average oxidation state of surface manganese confirmed the participation of oxygen from MnOx in the formation of formate species at room temperature and their transformation into CO2 and H2O when increasing the temperature.									164	21	0	0	29	0	173			2155-5435			WOS:000352464400031		
J	Ismael, Mohammed; Wark, Michael								Photocatalytic activity of CoFe2O4/g-C3N4 nanocomposite toward degradation of different organic pollutants and their inactivity toward hydrogen production: The role of the conduction band position								FLATCHEM				32						100337	10.1016/j.flatc.2022.100337				MAR 2022	2022	Recently, graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4)-based composite photocatalyst has been investigated as a promising photocatalyst for degradation of organic pollutants. In this paper, a simple calcination method was used to prepare CoFe2O4/g-C3N4 p-n heterojunction photocatalysts. The morphological structure, optical, and electrochemical properties of the as-synthesized CoFe2O4/g-C3N4 p-n junction photocatalysts were characterized. Furthermore, the photocatalytic activity of the CoFe2O4/g-C3N4 p-n junction photocatalysts was evaluated not only for degradation of methyl orange (MO) but also for non-colored 4-chlomphenol (4-CP) under visible light irradiation. The 3% CoFe2O4/g-C3N4 of showed the highest photocatalytic activity that can activate H2O2 and degrade MO up to 98% in 4 h. The remarkable enhancement was mainly ascribed to the interfacial transfer of photogenerated charge carriers and the role of H2O2 in the generation of more hydroxyl radicals via photo-Fenton-like reaction. Additionally, scavenger experiments showed that hydroxyl radicals are the dominant active oxygen species responsible for the photodegradation reaction, while superoxide radicals play a minor role. Importantly, this composite showed no activity toward hydrogen production due to the positive band position of CoFe2O4. This work may provide a simple and low-cost method for large-scale production of visible-light-active photocatalyst that can be applied for environmental remediation applications.									7	0	0	0	0	0	7			2452-2627			WOS:000754736000005

The two natural quartz diorites (leucocratic poikilitic quartz diorite - 'LPD' and melanocratic quartz diorite - 'MD') differ in whole rock and mineral composition with MD being richer in MgO and poorer in CaO than LPD, probably due to accumulation of mafic minerals or melt removal in MD. LPD represents melt composition and is used to reconstruct crystallization conditions in the GA (TM) siniec Intrusion. The crystallization history of LPD magma, deduced from experimental and natural mineral compositions, includes a higher pressure stage probably followed by emplacement at similar to 2 kbar of partly crystallized magma at temperatures similar to 850-800A degrees C and quick cooling. The mineral assemblage present in LPD requires water contents in the magma of at least 5 wt% and oxygen fugacity below that controlled by the NNO buffer. The compositions of mafic minerals in the MD composition were equilibrated at temperatures below 775A degrees C and at subsolidus conditions. The equilibration was probably due to the reaction between water-rich, oxidizing residual melt and the cumulatic-restitic mineral assemblage. MD is characterized by occurrence of the euhedral cummingtonite and increasing anorthite content in the rims of plagioclase. A similar reaction was reproduced experimentally in both LPD and MD compositions indicating that cummingtonite may be a late magmatic phase in quartz dioritic systems, crystallizing very close to solidus and only from water saturated magma.									19	2	0	0	1	0	22			0930-0708	1438-1168		WOS:000271950800001

CeO2-supported Cu catalysts have shown high activity and selectivity for the hydrogenation of CO2 to CO. To uncover the origin of their high performance, we prepared a practical and well-defined model of Cu/CeO2-x catalysts with Cu nanoparticles dispersed on a CeO2-x support. We studied the structure and catalytic activity of the practical catalyst and the evolution of the active phase and surface intermediates using near-ambient-pressure X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (NAP-XPS) over the model catalyst under CO2 hydrogenation conditions. For both model and practical catalysts, metallic copper and partially reduced ceria with oxygen vacancies were found to be active sites for the reduction of CO2 to CO. Over the model catalyst, partial covering of Cu by CeO2-x and diffusion of Cu into CeO2-x was observed, suggesting that a strong interaction between Cu and CeO2-x was favored during CO2 hydrogenation. The surface analysis results indicated that the CO2 hydrogenation proceeded through the following steps: activation of CO2 in the form of carbonate on the surface of CeO2-x, hydrogenation of carbonate to formate on the surface of Cu by the dissociated H-2, and conversion of formate to CO. This work provides direct experimental evidence on the surface properties of Cu and ceria during the RWGS reaction and the activation and hydrogenation processes of CO2 over the Cu/CeO2-x surface for a high RWGS catalytic performance.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			2574-0962			WOS:000771422400004

For this purpose, significant reactions among the reactive species in the discharge are taken into account in this work by considering more than 70 reactions for 13 species. The model used in this study to describe the kinetics of the plasma species is the second order fluid model which consists in replacing the Boltzmann equation by these first three moments by using the drift-diffusion approximation for flux. In order to validate the model developed in this research, a comparison of the simulated discharge currents obtained with available experimental data is carried out, before presenting the evolution of the properties of the plasma species. After that, a parametric study is performed showing the effect of some parameters like applied voltage, frequency and nature of the coating dielectric material on the characteristics of DBD in nitrogen. Simulation results for a double dielectric DBD reactor are also presented at the end of this paper.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1300-0101	1303-6122		WOS:000624346600003

Over the years, different strategies have been developed to tailor electrocatalyst surfaces but also to reduce the cost of these materials, which is the bottleneck for any practical application. When a very thin metallic layer, intended to serve as an electrocatalyst, is placed over a substrate, its configuration is influenced by the structure of the substrate due to lattice mismatch, while the electronic structure is affected due to the strain and the electronic effects of the support. This results in altered bonding within the electrocatalyst layer and the modification of its electronic properties when compared to the pure phase. In this contribution, we address the possibilities of theoretical prediction of surface properties of atomically thin electrocatalyst films formed over different substrates, focusing on the metal side of the electrified interface. While all these properties can be calculated quite easily using modern computational techniques (but used with care), most often based on density functional theory, we also address an attractive, fast screening possibility to estimate the properties of monometallic and multimetallic overlayers using small sets of calculations on model systems. We discuss how lattice mismatch between a substrate and an overlayer can be used to predict the properties of electrocatalytic films, limitations of such approach, and a possibility of deploying of large databases which enable rapid prescreening of different support/overlayer systems for various electrocatalytic applications.									15	1	0	0	0	0	15			2155-5435			WOS:000464075700074

This paper focuses on a new type of electrocatalyst fabrication using high purity beta-molybdenum carbide (referred to as Mo2C hereafter) nanotubes as a support and atomic layer deposition (ALD) as the Pt nanoparticle deposition technique (Pt/Mo2C). In particular, rotary ALD equipment was used to grow Pt particles from the subnanometer level to 2 to 3 nanometers by simply adjusting the number of ALD cycles in order to probe the interaction between the deposited Pt nanoparticles and Mo2C nanotube support. Lattice spacing analysis using high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) images, combined with Pt binding energy shift in XPS results, clearly showed a strong interaction between Pt nanoparticles and the Mo2C nanotube support in all the resultant Pt/Mo2C samples. We postulate that this strong interaction is responsible for the significantly enhanced durability observed in constant potential electrolysis (CPE) testing. Of the three samples from different ALD cycles (15, 50 and 100), Mo2C nanotubes modified by 50 (1.07 wt% Pt loading) and 100 cycles (4.4 wt% Pt) of Pt deposition showed higher activity per Pt mass than commercial 20% Pt supported on carbon black. Finally, we report the nanoscale Pt/Mo2C catalyst performance in a device setting for different Pt loadings by applying it in a PEMFC anode.									30	3	0	0	1	0	31			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000378947200038

The catalysts were prepared with a two-step method: (1) reaction between CdCl2 and NaOH and (2) exchange of hydroxide ions of Cd(OH)(2) intermediate with S2- to form CdS. Influence of the reagents addition rate, stirring rate, temperature of the reaction mixture and the reagents' ratio on the oxidation rate of alcohols on solids was investigated. It was found that the rate of photooxidation increases with the increase in the stirring rate and with the decrease in the reagents addition rate during the synthesis. The photocatalytic activity as a function of sulfur content reaches the highest value for the stoichiometric CdS, which is obtained at >= 2:1 S2- to Cd2+ molar ratio in precursors. Kinetic features of the isopropanol photocatalytic oxidation were studied. The Langmuir-Hinshelwood model describes satisfactorily the rate vs. concentration curve. The increase in the air relative humidity results in higher isopropanol oxidation rate. Partial deactivation of CdS catalyst was observed and described with exponential decay. Deactivation was less pronounced at high relative humidity. CdS deactivation took place due to the surface sulfur ions oxidation with formation of SO42- groups. The results show a potential of CdS photocatalysis for solar light-driven green oxidation processes of organic compounds. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

Two key neutron-induced reactions will occur with oxygen in the water producing the radioactive isotopes N-16 and N-17, which have relatively short half-lives of a few seconds. These nuclides are transported in coolant loops and, unmitigated, their decay emissions will induce additional nuclear heat in components, potentially including superconducting magnets, and lead to an increase in the occupational dose for workers and sensitive equipment outside the biological shield. Variations in irradiation, water flow rate and cooling circuit parameters make it difficult to predict nuclear heating. A water activation experiment has recently been performed at the 14 MeV Frascati Neutron Generator to accurately measure N-16 and N-17 produced by irradiating an ITER first wall mock-up. This experiment aimed to validate the methodology for water activation assessment used for ITER and to provide scientific justification to reduce safety factors, which have a large impact on ITER component design and qualification. This paper provides a detailed description of neutronics calculations performed together with the GammaFlow code to model the temporal evolution of activated water, along with MCNP6.1 and FISPACT-II to calculate the detector response. The calculated reaction rates associated with nuclear data from ten libraries have been compared with measured data, although as many cross-sections originated from the same library effectively five nuclear data libraries have been compared.					14th International Symposium on Fusion Nuclear Technology (ISFNT)14th International Symposium on Fusion Nuclear Technology (ISFNT)	SEP 22-27, 2019SEP 22-27, 2019		Budapest, HUNGARYBudapest, HUNGARY	8	0	0	0	0	0	8			0920-3796	1873-7196		WOS:000580835200013

It is desirable to identify key parameters playing a role in the maximization of the surface area, growth rate, and nanotube lengths. In this work, the role of the crystallographic orientation of the underlying Ti substrate on the growth rate of anodic self-organized TiO2 nanotubes in viscous organic electrolytes in the presence of small amounts of fluorides is studied. A systematic analysis of cross sections of the nanotubular oxide films on differently oriented substrate grains was conducted by a combination of electron backscatter diffraction and scanning electron microscopy. The characterization allows for a correlation between TiO2 nanotube lengths and diameters and crystallographic parameters of the underlying Ti metal substrate, such as planar surface densities. It is found that the growth rate of TiO2 nanotubes gradually increases with the decreasing planar atomic density of the titanium substrate. Anodic TiO2 nanotubes with the highest aspect ratio form on Ti(-151) [which is close to Ti(010)], whereas nanotube formation is completely inhibited on Ti(001). In the thin compact oxide on Ti(001), the electron donor concentration and electronic conductivity are higher, which leads to a competition between oxide growth and other electrochemical oxidation reactions, such as the oxygen evolution reaction, upon anodic polarization. At grain boundaries between oxide films on Ti(hk0), where nanotubes grow, and Ti(001), where thin compact oxide films are formed, the length of nanotubes decreases most likely because of lateral electron migration from TiO2 on Ti(001) to TiO2 on Ti(hk0).									29	2	0	0	1	0	31			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000348688700034	25545715

PERALUMINOUS PEGMATITIC GRANITES AND THEIR PEGMATITE AUREOLES IN THE WINNIPEG RIVER DISTRICTS, SOUTHEASTERN MANITOBA								CANADIAN MINERALOGIST				19				177	194						FEB 1981	1981	Late- to post-tectonic stocks and plugs of Pegmatitic granites were intruded along partlv dilated fault svstems in the Archean Bird River green-stone belt of the English River subprovince in southeastern Manitoba. Each intrusion consists of four phases: (1) fine grained leucogranite locally gradine into (2) interlayered sodic aplite and (3) potassic pegmatite, and (4) pegmatitic leucogranite that also contains bands and lenses of potassic pegmatite. This last phass carries occasional Li-, Be-, Nb-Ta-, As-, P-, B-, F- and Zn-bearing minerals. Textural and compositional relationships suggest separation of supercritical fluids from volatile-oversaturated melt as the primary cause of internal diversity. Bulk compositions are silicic, poor in Ca, Fe and Mg and highly fractionated in terms of K/Rb, K/Cs, K/Ba, Ca/Sr, Rb/Sr, Th/U, Mg/Li and Al/Ga, The rocks are peraluminous, as indicated by 0.1 to 5.0% of normative corundum (CPW) and by the presence of muscovite, garnet, tourmaline, gahnite and cordierite. From fine grained leucogranites through sodic aplites and pegmatitic leucogranites to potassic pegmatites. the peraluminous character increases and Sigma REE contents decrease. The genetic evidence available, including REE abundances and oxygen-isotope ratios. is inconclusive: juvenile origin of parent melts modified by subsequent fractionation and by reaction with greenstone-belt metasediments is possible, as well as shallow anatexis of greenstone-belt lithologies followed by igneous fractionation and reaction with host rocks. Loss of fluids to the country rocks probably contributed to the enhanced peraluminous character of pegmatitic fractions and to the depletion of their Sigma REEs.									67	2	0	0	0	1	69			0008-4476	1499-1276		WOS:000208512700013

However, currently most transition metal-based catalysts can only be used in alkaline environments, because most of them are unstable in acidic and highly oxidative environments, as well as single-purposed. Therefore, it is a great challenge to seek for stable bifunctional catalysts with high hydrogen and oxygen evolution reaction (HER&OER) kinetics in wide pH range. Although Ru nanoparticles possess high activity, they easily suffer leaching and oxidation inactivation. To this, a bifunctional Ru@MoO(S)(3) nano-capsule structure electrocatalyst applied to the wide pH range is designed and built, in which Ru nanoparticles are harmoniously encapsulated in a sulfur-modulated molybdenum oxide (MoO(S)(3)) shell. This all-in-one integration allows Ru to retain intrinsic catalytic activity and rapid mass transfer process while preventing Ru from electrochemical oxidation and then guaranteeing recyclability. Specially, Ru@MoO(S)(3) drives the water splitting in 0.5 M H2SO4 and 1 M KOH at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) only needs 1.522 V and 1.526 V cell voltage, respectively, with nearly 100 % Faraday efficiency. This is the first report that a catalyst possesses almost the same water splitting activity in acidic and alkaline media, and also significantly surpasses the commercial Pt/C and RuO2 catalyst electrode pairs. In addition, in the 24 h constant current water splitting test, Ru@MoO(S)(3) has very small current density decay. This work provides a new insight into design of bifunctional electrocatalysts for efficient pH-wide water splitting.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2211-2855	2211-3282		WOS:000836648700004

Emphasis is being directed to the generation of sustainable energy by the fuel cell and water splitting technologies. Accordingly, the development of highly efficient electrocatalysts has attracted significant interest, as the fuel cell and water splitting technologies are critically dependent on their performance. Among numerous catalyst designs under investigation, nanoframe catalysts have an intrinsically large surface area per volume and a tunable composition, which impacts the number of catalytically active sites and their intrinsic catalytic activity, respectively. Nevertheless, the structural integrity of the nanoframe during electrochemical operation is an ongoing concern. Some significant advances in the field of nanoframe catalysts have been recently accomplished, specifically geared to resolving the catalytic stability concerns and significantly boosting the intrinsic catalytic activity of the active sites. Herein, general synthetic concepts of nanoframe structures and their structure-dependent catalytic performance are summarized, along with recent notable advances in this field. A discussion on the remaining challenges and future directions, addressing the limitations of nanoframe catalysts, are also provided.									40	2	0	0	2	0	40			0935-9648	1521-4095		WOS:000545781400001	32633878

CTNMs allows access to nano-based materials that are difficult to synthesize by conventional means, including metastable materials through partial transformations. These new nanomaterial forms can have property and stability advantages when used for energy applications. This short review highlights recent research progress in chemical transformations of non-metallic nanomaterials as a means to create useful energy materials, such as metastable structures, with a focus on fuel cell catalysts and battery technologies. In addition to discussing progress with chemically transformed materials, this review briefly highlights several metastable materials that have been used for energy applications but were synthesized through conventional means. Synthetic protocols of CTNMs could be used to produce these metastable energy materials, which may result in novel properties. Finally, the review concludes with a forward looking perspective of metastable materials that have yet to be synthesized, but are good candidates for catalysis/batteries as metastable materials. These proposed systems could yield next generation catalysts/battery materials.									40	1	0	0	5	0	41			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000333580700002

The growth of Sb-doped SnO(2)-NPs was controlled using micelles of the block copolymer surfactant and homogeneous precipitation approaches. SEM and HRTEM confirmed that BDD still can be fully exposed after modification of Sb-doped SnO(2)-NPs. The prepared Sb-doped SnO(2)-NPs/BDD electrode maintained high oxygen evolution potential (2.3 V vs SCE); meanwhile, its conductivity is greatly improved when the resistance decreases to 1.2 from 60.8 k Omega and the reaction activation energy also reduces from 8.02 to 4.93 kJ mol(-1), owing to the excellent electrocatalytic performance. Moreover, Sb-doped SnO(2)-NPs/BDD has higher oxidation ability. The reaction rate constant of 2,4-D on the Sb-doped SnO(2)-NPs/BDD is 2 times and mineralization current efficiency at 30 min on the Sb-doped SnO(2)-NPs/BDD is 1.6 times that on the BDD. The time for complete removal of the total organic carbon (TOC) is 240 min on the Sb-doped SnO(2)-NPs/BDD electrode, while it is beyond 360 min on the BDD. Energy consumption on the BDD is 1.3 times that on the Sb-doped SnO(2)-NPs/BDD for the TOC total removal. The generation and further oxidation of the intermediates further approved the high efficiency of the Sb-doped SnO(2)NPs/BDD.									35	5	0	0	7	0	37			1932-7447			WOS:000276096200028

The expression of voltage-gated potassium ion (Kv) channels is highly variable according to the state of macrophages activation. Macrophages have an important function in innate immunity against intruding pathogens. They produce a variety of inflammatory and immunoactive molecules that modulate imflammatory responses. Here we show that blockade of K+ channels by non-selective Kv channel inhibitor tetraethylammonium chloride (TEA), and 4-aminopyridine (4-AP) inhibited proinflammatory cytokines expression, cell proliferation, and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production in LPS-stimulated macrophages of Sea perch (Lateolabrax japonicas). Then we isolated four Kv channels genes (spKv1.1, spKv1.2, spKv1.5 and spKv3.1) in LPS-activated fish macrophages. These channels genes were up-regulated after LPS stimulation except spKv3.1, which remained unchanged during the test. The results of this study indicate that Kv channels could be required for modulating the immune function of fish macrophages. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

However, limited oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) kinetics on the cathode still remains the main bottleneck for commercialization. We report the synthesis of size-controllable monodisperse PtP(2)nanoparticles (NPs) on nitrogen- and phosphorus-doped carbon (NPC) with initial ORR mass and specific activities of 0.466 A mg(Pt)(-1)and 0.438 mA cm(-2)at 0.9 V in 0.1 M HClO(4)solution,viaa combined template and pyrolysis method. The activities increase to 0.724 A mg(Pt)(-1)and 0.508 mA cm(-2)after 3000 potential cycles and remain stable for a further 20 000 cycles, exhibiting an obvious improvement over the commercial Pt benchmark (0.142 mA cm(-2)and 0.098 A mg(Pt)(-1)at 0.9 V). The facilitated ORR activity of PtP2@NPC after incipient cycles of the stability test is due to the self-conversion process from PtP(2)to core-shell Pt/PtP(2)with a thin (approximate to 1 nm) Pt shell and the consequential geometric and strain effects of the Pt skin which contribute to both the robustness and catalytic efficiency of the catalysts. Meanwhile, a four-electron pathway towards the ORR also indicates the high selectivity of our catalyst. Combined computational analysis indicates that the core-shell structure intensifies ORR activity by a more feasible rate-determining step and lower d-band center value.									13	1	0	0	1	0	13			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000578872600020

The main focus is to understand the role of low-cost catalysts in the fast pyrolysis of lignin. The four most commonly used low-cost catalysts, ilmenite (FeTiO3), bentonite (Al-Si-OH), activated carbon (AC) and red mud (RM), were selected. The results show that bentonite, red mud and activated carbon effectively enhance the dehydration reaction, which is regarded as the dominant way to eliminate oxygen during the pyrolysis process, due to the existence of strong acidic sites. However, only activated carbon is found to be effective in promoting the production of monocyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (MAHs). Two metallic catalysts, i. e., bentonite and red mud, have strong acidities but quite low surface areas and less porous structures. Therefore, the dehydrated intermediates produced are especially easy to repolymerize to form char or coke without the restriction of obtaining a porous structure during the pyrolysis process. Activated carbon has not only a certain acidity but also a rich porous structure. Lignin fast pyrolysis-derived oxygenates can diffuse and react on the well-dispersed active sites within the pores of activated carbons. The catalytic performance of the activated carbon are supposed to be determined by the pore size. Only pores of similar size to lignin fast pyrolysis-derived oxygenates (0.6-1 nm) seems to be effective for the production of MAHs. Pores larger or smaller than lignin fast pyrolysis-derived oxygenates both tend to cause coke deposition rather than MAHs formation.									29	1	0	0	5	0	30			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000471682900081
