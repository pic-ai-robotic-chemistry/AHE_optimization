Herein, we report remarkable promotion of OER performance on the NiFe-based nanocomposite electrocatalyst via the synergy of multiple carbon-based interface engineering. Specifically, carbon nanotubes were in situ grown on carbon fiber paper to improve the interface between CFP and NiFeOxHy, and graphite carbon nanoparticles were in situ loaded and partly doped into the NiFeOxHy to modify the intergranular interface charge transfer and electronic structure of NiFeOxHy. Consequently, the as-obtained NiFeOxHy-C/CNTs/CFP catalyst exhibited significantly enhanced electrocatalytic OER activity with an overpotential of 202 mV at 10 mA cm???2 in 1 mol L???1 KOH. Our work not only extends application of carbon materials but also provides an alternative strategy to develop highly efficient electrocatalysts.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0253-9837	1872-2067		WOS:000842369100008

Here, we report trimetallic N-doped carbon nanotubes with rapid electron transport and rapid diffusion of the electrolyte that can significantly enhance the OER. The introduction of a third metal can adjust the electronic structure, thereby causing favorable intermediate adsorption on the catalysts. The optimized catalyst CoFeNi@CNTs exhibits a low overpotential of 287 mV at 10 mA cm(-2)and a small Tafel slope of 32 mV dec(-1), which are obviously superior to the precious catalyst IrO(2)and most previously reported catalysts. The CoFeNi@CNTs also exhibit excellent OER stability with small current density decay after 12 h. The outstanding OER activity is ascribed to the unique carbon nanotube structure and strong synergy between three metals.									6	1	0	0	0	0	6			2199-692X			WOS:000570373600001

Its corrosion is often reported during electrocatalysis at high anodic potentials, especially in acidic electrolyte. Investigation of the carbon corrosion in alkaline environment is difficult due to the CO2/CO(3)(2-)equilibrium. We report the on-line determination of electrolysis products generated on NixB/C hybrid electrocatalysts in alkaline electrolyte at anodic potentials using differential electrochemical mass spectrometry (DEMS). NixB/C catalyst films were obtained from mixtures containing different ratios of NiXB and benzoxazine monomers followed by polymerization and pyrolysis. The impact of the composition of the electrocatalyst on the dominant electrolysis process allows to distinguish between the oxygen evolution reaction and carbon corrosion using DEMS results as well as the catalyst surface composition evaluated from X-ray photoelectron spectra. At the imposed highly oxidative conditions, an increasing amount of NixB in the electrocatalyst leads to a suppression of carbon corrosion.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			2196-0216			WOS:000544040500021

The superior OER performance of newly developed non-noble metal electrocatalysts has concealed the identification of the real active species of the catalysts. Now, the critical active phase in nickel-based materials (represented by NiNPS) was directly identified by observing the dynamic surface reconstruction during the harsh OER process via combining insitu Raman tracking and exsitu microscopy and spectroscopy analyses. The irreversible phase transformation from NiNPS to alpha-Ni(OH)(2) and reversible phase transition between alpha-Ni(OH)(2) and gamma-NiOOH prior to OER demonstrate gamma-NiOOH as the key active species for OER. The hybrid catalyst exhibits 48-fold enhanced catalytic current at 300mV and remarkably reduced Tafel slope to 46mVdec(-1), indicating the greatly accelerated catalytic kinetics after surface evolution.									137	8	0	0	11	0	138			1433-7851	1521-3773		WOS:000494114100001	31550415

Herein, we examined the potential-dependent structural and chemical changes occurring on planar Ir(111), Ir(210), and nanofaceted Ir(210) single-crystal surfaces using electrochemistry, scanning probe microscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. We show that, after polarization in OER conditions, Ir surface atoms feature mixed oxidation states-(0), (+III), and (+IV)-and then enrich into Ir(+IV) due to the dissolution of Ir(+III) species. The rate of surface and near-surface layer enrichment in Ir(+IV) species depends on the modulation mode of the potential (linear potential sweeps vs. potential steps) and is faster on opened surfaces. By combining fits derived from the XPS spectra and OER activity measurements, we found that the OER specific activity varies with the Ir oxidation state and is closely related to the fraction of Ir(+III) species.									17	0	0	0	0	0	17			2155-5435			WOS:000494549700017

Many redox reactions of biological or analytical importance are proton-coupled, resulting in localized interfacial pH changes as the reaction proceeds. Other important electrochemical reactions, such as hydrogen and oxygen evolution reactions, can likewise result in pH changes near the electrode. However, it is very difficult to measure pH changes located within around 100 mu m of the electrode surface. This paper describes the use of in situ attenuated total reflectance (ATR) infrared (IR) spectroscopy to determine the pH of different solutions directly at the electrode interface, while a potential is applied. Changes in the distinctive IR bands of solution phosphate species are used as an indicator of pH change, given that the protonation state of the phosphate ions is pH-dependent. We found that the pH at the surface of an electrode modified with carbon nanotubes can increase from 4.5 to 11 during the hydrogen evolution reaction, even in buffered solutions. The local pH change accompanying the hydroquinone-quinone redox reaction is also determined.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0				1996-1944		WOS:000507308200022	31817326

This defect engineering strategy is realized by a facile urea oxidation method in nitrogen atmosphere. Through X-ray diffraction (XRD) refinement and other detailed characterizations, molybdenum ion (Mo4+) is found to be doped into Co3O4 by substituting cobalt ion (Co2+) at tetrahedron site, while N is doped into carbon matrix simultaneously. 4%Mo-Co3O4/NC is the optimized sample to show the lowest overpotentials of 91 and 276 mV to deliver 10 mA cm-2 for HER and OER in 1 M potassium hydroxide solution (KOH), respectively. The overall water splitting cell 4%Mo-Co3O4/NC parallel to 4%Mo-Co3O4/NC displays a voltage of 1.62 V to deliver 10 mA cm(-2) in 1 M KOH. The Mo4+ dopant modulates the electronic structure of active cobalt ion (Co3+) and boosts the water dissociation process during HER, while the increased amount of lattice oxygen and formation of pyridinic nitrogen due to Mo doping benefits the OER activity. Besides, the smaller grain size owing to Mo doping leads to higher electrochemically active surface area (ECSA) on 4%Mo-Co3O4/NC, resulting in its superior bifunctional catalytic activity.

This work presents a simple and facile synthesis of graphitic carbon coated NixRuy alloys. The optimized catalyst (e-Ni0.6Ru0.4@C) displays an ultrafine morphology and outstanding HER and OER activities in alkaline media, which are among the best reported so far for various carbon-based electrocatalysts. Remarkably, the e-Ni0.6Ru0.4@C||e-Ni0.6Ru0.4@C pair needs a low cell voltage of 1.51/1.62 V for driving OWS to reach 10/100 mA cm(-2), far outperforming the benchmark electrode pair Pt/C||RuO2. As expected, this carbon-based catalyst also exhibits superior durability as compared to that of precious catalysts. The experimental evidence combined with density functional theory (DFT) computations thus demonstrates for the first time that minor Ru alloying enables not only the morphological modulation but also the fine electronic modification of the catalyst, which both facilitate the overall electrochemical reactions on the carbon shell surface. Thus, our results may further shed light on how to design and optimize carbon-based electrocatalysts to achieve enhanced catalytic performance for OWS.									27	2	0	0	0	0	27			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000536095500023		
J	Boozer, A.H.								Late stages of stellar evolution carbon- oxygen stars and neutron stars								Late stages of stellar evolution carbon- oxygen stars and neutron stars								131 pp	131 pp						01 Jan. 1970	1970	The carbon-oxygen stars considered had a composition of 50% carbon and 50% oxygen by mass. The purpose of studying these stars is to understand better the stages of stellar evolution after helium shell burning. The masses considered were 1.25, 1.35, and 1.43 solar masses. The evolution was followed from the onset of carbon burning, which was in the centre for all the masses considered, until the star cooled to white dwarf or ignited oxygen. Zero temperature models of the burned out cores of carbon-oxygen stars were also considered to find the maximum size a cold, burned-out carbon-oxygen star can have (about 1.35 modot), to investigate the effects of general relativity, and to see how well the binding energy of shell burning carbon- oxygen stars could be reproduced by zero temperature models. Neutron stars with central densities up to 4.63times1014 g/cc were also considered using the approximation of Nemeth and Sprung (1968). The method used for deriving neutron star equations of state is described in considerable detail and the basic equations needed to calculate an equation of state are derived.									0	0	0		0	0	0						INSPEC:349593		
J	Wang, Hua; Zhang, Wei; Xin, Haihui; Wang, Deming; Di, Cuicui; Liu, Lu								Characteristics of Pyrolysis and Low Oxygen Combustion of Long Flame Coal and Reburning of Residues								ENERGIES				14	10					2944	10.3390/en14102944				MAY 2021	2021	To further understand the problems of coal combustion and coalfield fire reignition, this paper researched the reaction characteristics of coal pyrolysis and low oxygen combustion and the reburning oxidation characteristics of residual structure by thermal analysis methods. The results show that temperature promotes both pyrolysis and low oxygen combustion reactions, but low oxygen combustion reaction is more sensitive to temperature changes. As the constant temperature rises, the mass reduction rate of low oxygen combustion of coal samples reaches 80% on average, which is 4 times that of pyrolysis, and the variations of thermogravimetric parameters are also significantly higher than those of pyrolysis. However, the higher the pyrolysis degree of the residues, the stronger their oxidizability, which greatly enhances the intensity and concentration of the secondary combustion, and the mass of residues is reduced by 90% on average. Conversely, because the combustible components are continuously consumed during low oxygen combustion, the reburning characteristics of residues become less obvious. For instance, the weight loss rate slows down, the burning becomes dispersed, and the burning intensity is weakened. In addition, the heat release is reduced from 8662 to 444.5 J/g, and the change trend is just opposite to that of pyrolysis. The above results show that as the constant temperature rises, the pyrolysis reaction greatly shortens the reburning process, while the low oxygen combustion reaction largely inhibits the reburning.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3				1996-1073		WOS:000662399200001

The fabricated catalysts Co3W3C/CoP/NPC have shown prominent trifunctional electrocatalytic activities for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), evidenced by a positive half-wave potential of 0.803 V for ORR and a much low overpotential (at 10 mA/cm(2)) of 139/200 mV for HER and OER in alkaline electrolyte, respectively. Furthermore, the rechargeable zinc-air battery based on the optimum CoWCP-NPC-2:1 catalyst has shown a prominent high power density of 205.5 mW/cm(2) and a specific capacity of 800.5 mAh.g(-1) after 83.5 h/501 cycles at 10 mA/cm(2).

In this work, rose-like, ruthenium-doped cobalt nitride nanoflowers grown in situ on Ti3C2Tx MXene are synthesized through a simple oil bath method followed by nitridation treatment under an NH3 atmosphere. Benefiting from good conductivity and an optimized electronic structure, the resultant Ru-CoN/Ti3C2Tx MXene exhibits remarkable and stable bifunctional electrocatalytic activities towards both the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in 1.0 M KOH solution. More importantly, a two-electrode electrolyzer constructed with the Ru-CoN/Ti3C2Tx MXene only needs a low cell voltage of 1.52 V to deliver a current density of 10 mA cm(-2), outperforming the benchmark RuO2||Pt/C couple and most recently reported representative bifunctional electrocatalysts. This work provides a new strategy for the rational design and fabrication of efficient and nonprecious catalysts for water electrocatalysis and other electrochemical energy systems.									7	0	0	0	0	0	7			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000691873900001

However, liquid-phase exfoliation always utilizes organic solvents that are harmful to the environment, and the active sites are limited to edge sites. Here, an environmentally friendly exfoliator in aqueous solution is presented without utilizing any toxic or hazardous substance and active site self-assembly on the inert base of 2D materials. Benefiting from thin 2D/2D heterostructure and strong interfacial coupling, the resultant highly disordered amorphous NiFe/2D materials (Ti3C2 MXene, graphene and MoS2) thin nanosheets exhibit extraordinary electrocatalytic performance toward oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in alkaline media. DFT results further verify the experimental results. The study emphasizes a viable idea to probe efficient electrocatalysts by means of the synergistic effect of environmentally friendly exfoliator in aqueous solution and active site self-assembly on the inert base of 2D materials which forms the unique thin 2D/2D heterostructure in-suit. This new type of heterostructure opens up a novel avenue for the rational design of highly efficient 2D materials for electrocatalysis.									54	6	0	0	4	0	54			1613-6810	1613-6829		WOS:000467263300004	30941892

However, conventional metal oxide catalysts, used for high-performing OER, tend to incorporate comparatively expensive and less abundant precious metals such as Ru and Ir, and, moreover, suffer from poor stability. To attempt to mitigate for all of these issues, we have prepared one-dimensional (1D) OER-active perovskite nanorods using a unique, simple, generalizable, and robust method. Significantly, our work demonstrates the feasibility of a novel electroless, seedless, surfactant-free, wet solution-based protocol for fabricating "high aspect ratio" LaNiO3 and LaMnO3 nanostructures. As the main focus of our demonstration of principle, we prepared as-synthesized LaNiO3 rods and correlated the various temperatures at which these materials were annealed with their resulting OER performance. We observed generally better OER performance for samples prepared with lower annealing temperatures. Specifically, when annealed at 600 inverted perpendicular C, in the absence of a conventional conductive carbon support, our as-synthesized LaNiO3 rods not only evinced (i) a reasonable level of activity toward OER but also displayed (ii) an improved stability, as demonstrated by chronoamperometric measurements,									38	0	0	0	1	0	38			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000406646300029	28714661

Compared to the conventional alkaline water electrolysis technology, proton exchange membrane water electrolysis (PEMWE) possesses many advantages for green hydrogen production, but currently relies heavily on the expensive and scarce platinum group metals (PGMs) to catalyze the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), which hinders widespread deployment of the PEMWE technology. This short review article briefly summarizes recent efforts dedicated to developing PGM-free HER and OER catalysts, with a focus on the emerging ones showing promising catalytic performance.

Integrating bifunctional catalytically active sites into one multi-component might greatly improve the overall water-splitting performance. In this work, amorphous NiO nanosheets coupled with ultrafine Ni and MoO(3)nanoparticles (MoO3/Ni-NiO), which contains two heterostructures (i.e., Ni-NiO and MoO3-NiO), is fabricated via a novel sequential electrodeposition strategy. The as-synthesized MoO3/Ni-NiO composite exhibits superior electrocatalytic properties, affording low overpotentials of 62 mV at 10 mA cm(-2)and 347 mV at 100 mA cm(-2)for catalyzing the hydrogen and the oxygen evolution reaction (HER/OER), respectively. Moreover, the MoO3/Ni-NiO hybrid enables the overall alkaline water-splitting at a low cell voltage of 1.55 V to achieve 10 mA cm(-2)with outstanding catalytic durability, significantly outperforming the noble-metal catalysts and many materials previously reported. Experimental and theoretical investigations collectively demonstrate the generated Ni-NiO and MoO3-NiO heterostructures significantly reduce the energetic barrier and act as catalytically active centers for selective HER and OER, synergistically accelerating the overall water-splitting process. This work helps to fundamentally understand the heterostructure-dependent mechanism, providing guidance for the rational design and oriented construction of hybrid nanomaterials for diverse catalytic processes.									127	8	0	0	9	0	129			0935-9648	1521-4095		WOS:000560680500001	32815243

Here, we present fluorine and sulfur co-doped cobalt oxide nanosheets (SFO-Co) generated using a quick thermal exfoliation technique as efficient and long-lasting OER electrocatalysts. The SFO-Co catalyst has an ultralow overpotential of 170 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) and a large double-layer capacitance (C-dl) of 94.9 mF cm(-2), thanks to the synergistic effect of numerous anions, high density of active sites, and increased charge transfer capabilities. During a 50-h chronoamperometry test in 1 M KOH solution, the catalyst retains good performance at a steady current of 10 mA cm(-2). This research not only reveals a low-cost, high-efficiency OER electrocatalyst, but it also offers a strategic design for multi-component electrocatalytic material systems that takes electronic reconfiguration into account.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2522-0128	2522-0136		WOS:000840611400002

Here, Ir-IrO2/C catalysts with different iridium content are obtained by annealing Ir/C in air. The growth of IrO2 on Ir nanoparticles can form a core-shell structure and introduces strain at their interface. The local compressive strain on Ir nanoparticles is 7.2% in the optimal Ir-IrO2/C sample with Ir content of 14.3% (Ir-IrO2/C-3), which regulates the adsorption energy of intermediates and improves the catalytical performance of oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The overpotential of Ir-IrO2/C-3 at 10 mA.cm 2 is 264 mV in acidic electrolyte, 35 mV lower than that of Ir-IrO2/C with no lattice strain. Ir-IrO2/C-3 also exhibits the highest mass activity of 1304 A.g(Ir)(-1) at 1.55 V vs. RHE, which is higher than those of commercial catalysts. Furthermore, the activity of Ir-IrO2/C-3 can maintain 42 h with the potential increase of only 18 mV at 10 mA.cm(-2), proving that the lattice strain can also effectively improve the electrochemical stability.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2196-0216			WOS:000855116600001

Transmission electron microscopy, scanning electron microscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and X-ray diffractometry are performed to characterize the microstructure, morphology, composition, and crystal structure of the NS-CuS-CC samples. The electrochemical measurements demonstrate that the synthesized NS-CuS-CC electrocatalysts possess outstanding oxygen evolution reaction (OER) performance and superior long-term durability in 1 M KOH electrolyte. In particular, the NS-CuS-CC synthesized via the electrodeposition process at an applied current of 1.5 mA shows a low overpotential for the OER (358 mV at 10 mA/cm(2)), which is close to that of commercial IrO2 (346 mV at 10 mA/cm(2)). The exceptional OER property is ascribed to the NS-CuS having a large surface area to offer abundant reaction active sites and to the CC network structures supplying more ions and charge transfer channels during the electrocatalytic process.									27	1	0	0	0	0	27			0272-8842	1873-3956		WOS:000465058500123

To ensure low contact resistance through LiFX/Al contacts on c-Si substrates is demonstrated; due to this low-resistance contact, efficient oxygen-evolution reactions might increase. We achieve an onset-voltage reduction with a cathodic shift of approximately 233 mV and an overpotential reduction of approximately 270 mV at 10 mA/cm(2) in a 1 M KOH solution.

Transition-metal (TM)-based catalysts have been attracting attention due to their low cost and abundance, but their insufficient activity still remains a challenge. Here, 4 nm Mn3O4 nanoparticles (NPs) are successfully synthesized and their electrochemical behavior is investigated. Using electrokinetic analyses, an identical water oxidizing mechanism is demonstrated between the 4 and 8 nm Mn3O4 NPs. In addition, it is confirmed that the overall increase in the active surface area is strongly correlated with the superb catalytic activity of the 4 nm Mn3O4 NPs. To further enhance the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) performance, Ni foam substrate is introduced to maximize the entire number of the NPs participating in OER.

Hofmann-type metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) are layer-structured materials, and if they are synthesized in the form of regular-shaped and slim nanosheets, a higher density of exposed active sites and easier electron and mass transport will be expected. In the current study, we prepared such a type of Hofmann MOFs plus Ni site tuning for the OER. The characterizations verified the successful material synthesis and characteristics. Density functional theory (DFT) simulations proved that the Ni site modified by Fe atom is more efficient for the critical OH* as well as O* intermediate formation. Taking advantage of the designed unique structure configuration, the as-obtained Fe-Ni Hofmann-type MOF showed the OER activity with an overpotential of 290 mV at the current density of 10 mA cm(-2) and a Tafel slope of 44 mV dec(-1), the very best performance plus outstanding durability among the Hofmann-type MOFs for the OER known to date.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1				2574-0970		WOS:000752919200133

Herein, an innovative type of ultralow noble metals (Ir and Ru) doped hollow Ni (OH)(2) nanocage electrocatalysts are successfully constructed through an ion-assisted etching protocol. Interestingly, a remarkable OER activity is achieved for Ir-Ni(OH)(2) nanocage, delivering a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) with an ultralow overpotential of 248 mV in 1 M KOH electrolyte. More importantly, this synthetic method can also be extended to the synthesis of Ru-Ni(OH)(2) nanocages with outstanding OER performance. Mechanism study reveals that the superior OER performance is attributed to the ultralow noble metal doping, which not only effectively modifies the electronic structure of Ni(OH)(2), but also functions as the active sites toward OER. Moreover, the highly open hollow nanocage structure enables the catalyst to provide more exposed active sites available for reaction intermediates, contributing to the outstanding OER performance.									9	0	0	0	0	0	9			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000728683100003

Herein, we reported that a certain amount of Zirconium doping in Co3O4 can regulate the electronic structure and morphology, therefore, boost the OER electrocatalytic performance. Zr doped Co3O4 demonstrates more excellent OER activity than pure Co3O4, as confirmed by density functional theory (DFT) calculations and experimental results, where the acceleration of potential rate-determining step and the improvement of conductivity are attributed to the introduction of Zr-dopants. Specifically, the as-synthesized 3D Zr-Co3O4/NF exhibits prominent OER activity with low overpotential 307 mV to drive current density of 20 mA cm(-2), modest Tafel slope of 99 mV dec(-1) and robust stability in 1 M KOH electrolyte.

Electrodes consist of nanowire arrays with high surface area that are able to ensures a high electrolytic activity. To obtain different alloy compositions, the concentration of the elements in the deposition baths is appropriately tuned. Results show that the composition of nanowires does not change linearly with the composition of deposition bath but are richer in Fe. Nanostructured electrodes are tested as both cathodes and anodes in 30 wt% KOH aqueous solution, at room temperature to determine the best alloy composition. In all electrochemical tests, the electrodes that performed best are those with iron content of 78.95 at%. Particularly, the results are very promising for the oxygen evolution reaction, with a Tafel's slope of 40 mV and a potential of 1.532 V vs. RHE after 6 h at constant current of 50 mA cm(-2). Besides, preliminary tests in 0.5 M NaCl alkaline aqueous solution are also reported showing very promising results. (C) 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

This work proposes a facile co-reduction and subsequent co-oxidation strategy to gram-scale preparation of composition-controllable LDHs nanosheets by a case study of Ni-Fe LDHs. Different from the traditional coprecipitation method, this process does not need heating and pH control. More importantly, our method can make sure that the Ni-Fe proportion in the LDHs products is well consistent with that in the mother solution. Furthermore, the electrocatalytic OER results strongly demonstrate that the as-prepared Ni-Fe LDHs possess a top-scale activity toward OER in alkaline media, typically for the Ni6Fe4-LDH nanosheets with water oxidation overpotential as low as 0.24 V at a current density of 20 mA/cm(2). Besides, it presents excellent stability during the endurance test. Therefore, the co-reduction and subsequent co-oxidation strategy is an highly efficient way to LDHs nanosheets for electrochemical applications. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Mn oxides are among the commonly investigated types of metal oxides as OER catalysts. Recent studies showed that Mn(III) ions in the structure of Mn(IV) oxide have an essential role in OER. Previous works have only focused on adding different materials to induce Mn(III) ions in the structure of Mn(IV). Indeed, Mn(III) ions could be induced in the Mn(IV)-oxide structure in the presence of organic compounds, reductants, fluoride, chloride, and gold nano-particles. However, a challenging issue in the field is using a stable and perdurable force during OER to induce Mn(III) ions in the structure of Mn(IV). Herein, the effects of inducing Mn(III) ions on OER by different potentials on the surface of the prepared Mn(IV) oxide on fluorine-doped tin oxide were investigated in the phosphate buffer at pH 11, 7, and 3. Mn(IV) oxide under OER/Mn(III) induction shows no decrease in the current density, but for the same sample under OER alone, a decrease (15%) is observed in the current density after only 1000 s. At a lower inducing potential, a decrease for OER is observed, which corresponds to Mn(IV)/(III) reduction to Mn(II), and Mn(II) leaking effect. This investigation sheds new light on OER in the presence of Mn oxide and is a promising, low-cost, and environmentally friendly strategy, which results in an increase in the yield of OER.

Using Ni foam supported NiCo2O4 catalyst for oxygen evolution reaction as an example, it was found that the catalytic activity of NiCo2O4 from the residuals loaded on glass carbon is comparable to Ni foam supported NiCo2O4, while the specific activity and turnover frequency value of the former catalyst are many times higher than that of the supported catalyst. In view of sustainability and green development, residuals should be given more attention when catalyst is prepared using the hydrothermal fabrication approach.									48	1	0	0	2	0	48			1359-7345	1364-548X		WOS:000450898100021	30403229

Herein, we reported a simple and fast one-pot aqueous method for synthesis of two-dimensional porous bimetallic PtPd alloyed nanosheets (NSs) using benzyldimethylhexadecylammonium chloride (HDBAC) as the capping agent and stabilizer. The formation mechanism involved the oriented attachment and self-assembly. The PtPd NSs exhibited excellent oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activity with the positive shift (ca. 43 mV) of the half-wave potential in 0.1 M KOH solution, clearly outperforming that of commercial Pt/C (50 wt%). Moreover, the as-prepared catalyst displayed 2.4 times enlargement in mass activity (MA, 382.10 mA mg(-1)) and 3.5 times enhancement in specific activity (SA, 0.95 mA cm(-2)) relative to those of Pt/C at 0.80 V. Meanwhile, the as-obtained catalyst demonstrated highly boosted hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in 0.5 M H2SO4 electrolyte, surpassing that of Pt/C. These results reveal the practical applications of the catalyst in energy storage and conversion. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc.

La0.7Sr0.3Fe1-xNixO3-delta (denoted as LSFN-x) with increasing Ni content is found to crystallize in a higher symmetry structure and exhibit improved OER catalytic performance. The optimized cubic LSFN-0.4 catalyst delivers a 90-times higher specific activity than its non-doped parent rhombohedral compound La0.7Sr0.3FeO3-delta at an overpotential of 340 mV, with an overpotential of only 320 mV for 10 mA cm(-2) and a low Tafel slope of 35 mV dec(-1) in 0.1 M KOH, while maintaining excellent durability during 1000 continuous cycles and 50 h-water splitting in a laboratory-scale electrolyzer. The enhanced OER catalytic performance of LSFN-0.4 is highly correlated with its increased conductivity as well as the increased oxygen vacancy concentration.									6	0	0	0	0	0	5			2211-2855	2211-3282		WOS:000744014500004

In the present work, novel quaternary FeNiCoP amorphous alloys as self-supports electrocatalysts have been synthesized by a facile melt-spinning technique to investigate the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) performances. In the case of acidic solutions, the most active electrode requires only an overpotential of 497 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) with a Tafel slope of 79 mV dec(-1) and exhibits long term stability of approximately 20 h. Further, the material achieves a low overpotential of 281 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) with a Tafel slope of 38 mV dec(-1), being comparable to IrO2 in alkaline solutions. Mossbauer spectroscopy analyses prove that the density of Fe-centered clusters with low coordination numbers is increased remarkably after the Co addition, resulting in enriched active sites and an enhancement in OER activity. In addition to this, there is a distinct increase in reaction kinetics with an advance in electrical conductivity. Furthermore, a synergistic effect between Fe (Ni or Co) oxide/hydroxide and phosphate species contributes to expediting of the OER process. This study will offer a cost-effective transition-metal material as robust electrodes for efficient OER. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

The compositional difference between the surface layer and the core arises from the dissimilarity in the reduction potentials of Fe and Co at the synthesis temperature. The FeCo nanoparticles consisted of an Fe-rich FeCo alloy core and a Co-rich FeCo oxide layer. The size of the FeCo nanoparticles was approximately 207 nm, and Fe59Co41 (S4) showed optimal intrinsic catalytic activity for an oxygen evolution reaction. The overpotential of S4 was 285 mV at 10 mA/cm(2) in 1 M KOH solution, which is much lower than that of the other samples. In addition, after chronopotentiometry at 10 mA/cm(2) for 24 h in 1 M KOH, the overpotential at 10 mA/cm(2) increased from 285 to 294 mV. The enhancement of the catalyst properties was attributed not only to the synergetic effect of the metal core and oxide layer, but also to the optimal iron doping effect.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000780275400003

In this study, ultrathin nickel-iron layered double hydroxide (NiFe LDH) nanosheets were successfully synthesized through a facile hydrothermal reaction with the assistance of triethanolamine (TEA). Morphological and structural characterizations revealed that the presence of TEA modified the morphology of NiFe LDH, facilitated the synthesis of high-purity NiFe LDH, improved the crystallinity of NiFe LDH and resulted in a slight decrease in specific surface area. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis demonstrated the modulation of the electronic structure engendered by the addition of TEA, with nickel and iron appearing in high valence state in the resulting NiFe LDH nanosheets. The as-prepared NiFe LDH nanosheets possessed outstanding OER activity with fast kinetics, exhibiting a low overpotential of 261 mV to achieve a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) and a small Tafel slope of 32.5 mV dec(-1) in 1 M KOH. The excellent OER performance and rapid OER kinetics are mainly attributed to the high-valence Ni and Fe rather than the modification in the morphology and microstructure. (C) 2022 Elsevier Inc.

Herein, well-organized nanoarrays of nickel-, copper-, zinc-cobalt spinel oxides (NCO, CCO, ZCO) and pristine Co3O4 with same microstructure are controllably fabricated. The time-dependent growth process of specific nanoarrays is investigated, as well as catalytic mechanism of enhanced OER activity. Cationic substitution promotes the OER activity and CCO possesses the best activity due to the highest Co valence. Theoretic simulations further validate the valence state of octahedral Co active sites increase most when doped with Cu ions, contributing to accelerated OER kinetics. Importantly, this work provides new insights to rationally design high-performance OER catalysts for matching experi-mental results and catalytic mechanism studies. (c) 2022 Elsevier Inc.

Herein, we successfully developed a simple strategy to controllably synthesize a rare crystal structure of hexagonal close-packed (hcp) NiFe nanoparticle (NP) encapsulated in a N-doped carbon (NC) shell (hcp-NiFe@NC). Then, we systemically investigated the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) performance of the samples under alkaline conditions, in which the hcp-NiFe@NC exhibits superior OER activity compared to the conventional face-centered cubic (fcc) NiFe encapsulated in a N-doped carbon shell (fcc-NiFe@NC). At the current densities of 10 and 100 mAcm(-2), the hcp-NiFe@NC with Fe/Ni ratio of approximate to 5.4% only needs ultralow overpotentials of 226 mV and 263 mV versus reversible hydrogen electrode in 1.0 M KOH electrolyte, respectively, which were extremely lower than those of fcc-NiFe@NC and most of other reported NiFe-based electrocatalysts. We proposed that hcp-NiFe possesses favorable electronic property to expedite the reaction on the NC surface, resulting higher catalytic activity for OER. This research provides a new insight to design more efficient electrocatalysts by considering the crystal phase correlated electronic property.									176	13	0	0	12	0	177			1433-7851	1521-3773		WOS:000465413400052	30840347

With ammonium metatungstate as the precursor, two synthetic routes with and without carbon templates were investigated. Through the intermediate nitride route and with carbon black as template, the obtained tungsten carbide samples had higher BET area. In 100% H3PO4 at temperatures up to 185 degrees C, the carbide powders showed superior activity towards the hydrogen evolution reaction. A deviation was found in the correlation between the BET area and catalytic activity; this was attributed to the presence of excess amorphous carbon in the carbide powder. TEM imaging and TGA- DTA results revealed a better correlation of the activity with the carbide particle size.									19	0	0	0	1	0	19			1452-3981			WOS:000330024200041

Herein, we report the preparation of a metal-organic nanosheet with one-dimensional (1-D) [Co-4(OH)(2)](6+) chains via delamination of a 3-D MOF. The resultant atomically thin nanosheets are highly active, robust, and recyclable oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrocatalysts with a low overpotential 318 mV (without iR compensation) to achieve a current density of 10 mA cm(-2). These values along with the small Tafel slope (54 mV dec(-1)) exhibit a superior performance to the bulk MOF precursor and the benchmark RuO2 catalyst under the identical condition. The electrochemical studies ascribe the excellent OER activity to the high surface area, accessible Co-II sites, and good charge transfer of the nanosheets.									16	1	0	0	0	0	17			2574-0962			WOS:000458705800013

Specific regulation on active site to realize low energy barrier hydrogen generation provides a new perspective. In this work, an innovative low barrier route is provided on protonated N of g-C3N4 of S-scheme protonated g-C3N4 quantum dots/ZnO hybrid rich in oxygen vacancies (p-CNQDs/VO-ZnO). VO generated by quantum dots doping optimizes the electron structure of S-scheme, whereas the intensive electron directional transmission in S-scheme promotes protonation of p-CNQDs. Profited from the synergies of thermodynamic and dynamic, protons and electrons concentrate at edge-active N accomplish the efficient photocatalytic HER with a 117-fold elevated H-2 evolution.

Recently, carbon-based metal-free materials have played a crucial role in electrochemical devices. Carbon-based metal-free electrocatalysts have been recognized as proper alternatives for the replacement of frequently used Pt in these devices. Carbon nanotubes-graphene (CNTs-G) hybrids are three-dimensional (3D) carbonaceous structures that have attracted researchers' interest in the last decade. Because of the unique properties of sp(2)-hybridized carbon nanostructures viz. superb mechanical, electrical, and catalytic performances, plus recent extensive applications in various aspects, CNTs and graphene families are considered prospective heterostructure materials for next generation technologies. Moreover, carbon-based materials have demonstrated excellent performance in key reactions like oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), oxygen evolution reaction (OER), and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) that occur on the surface of catalysts or electrodes in electrochemical energy conversion/storage devices. The ability to accept functional groups and dopants, create defects, present a large surface area, high porosity, and superior electrolyte penetration, facilitate ion transport, accelerate charge transfer, and capability to form robust attachments between CNTs and graphene have made the CNTs-G hybrid materials suitable candidates in energy-related areas. This review discusses the recent achievements of 3D CNTs-G hybrid heterostructures from synthesis and theoretical concepts to developments and applications in oxygen-and hydrogen involving electrocatalysts and energy-related devices such as batteries and supercapacitors. Significantly, research gaps and critical issues are identified in order to pave the way for the future study of CNTs-G hybrid materials.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000810450000006

As a kind of clean renewable energy, hydrogen have attracted great attentions in recent years. Recently, Co3O4-based materials have emerged as promising candidates for electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), due to their attractive electrocatalytic activity, low cost as well as the electrochemical durability, which make it attract widely attentions. In this review, we summarize the application of Co3O4-based materials in electrocatalytic HER, including pure Co3O4, the doped Co3O4 and the Co3O4-based composite materials. Furthermore, the strategies to enhance their electrocatalytic performance are summarized and discussed, such as morphological engineering, doping, as well as compositing with other materials. Finally, the limitation and challenges of Co3O4-based materials for HER, as well as their prospects for future research, are proposed. We believe that this review will be helpful for scientists to seek promising HER electrocatalytic materials. (C) 2020 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Despite promising performances of Rh NCs in various applications, the systematical shape control of Rh NCs is still a formidable challenge due to its high surface energy. Herein, we demonstrate a route to realize the systematically controlled synthesis of Rh NCs from tetrahedron (TH), to concave tetrahedron (CT), and to nanosheet (NS) by simply switching the volume ratios between oleylamine (OAm) to 1-octadecene (ODE). This series of Rh NCs provides an ideal platform to carry out structure-dependent catalytic investigations in hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Significantly, all the Rh NCs exhibit highly efficient HER and OER activities, as well as outstanding stabilities during long-term durability tests with Rh NSs being the best, showing a class of promising catalysts for water splitting. This present study demonstrates the first example in investigating the solvent effects on modulating the structures of Rh NCs that promises huge opportunities for optimizing the electrochemical catalysis.									75	2	0	0	3	0	75			0897-4756	1520-5002		WOS:000403530600046

Herein, by employing density functional theory (DFT), a wide range of transition metal (TM = Sc, Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn, Ru, Rh, Pd, Ag, Cd, Ir, Pt and Au) atoms anchored on antimonene (Sb monolayer) with a single Sb vacancy as single-atom catalysts (SACs) were investigated for their HER, OER and ORR performance. The results indicate that the defective Sb monolayer can be stable. Some TM@Sb monolayers show excellent stability and good electrical conductivity, beneficial for electron transfer during electrocatalytic reactions. The Ir@ and Pt@Sb monolayers exhibit excellent HER performance, both with about -0.01 eV of Delta G(*H). The d band centre of the TM@Sb monolayer can be used to describe the binding strength between substrates and intermediates directly. The best OER electrocatalyst is the Pt@Sb monolayer, which shows an overpotential (eta(OER)) of 0.48 V. In contrast, the best ORR electrocatalyst is the Ag@Sb monolayer with an.ORR of 0.50 V, followed by Pd@, Rh@, Cd@ and Pt@Sb monolayers. Compared with pristine antimonene, only the noble metal atom could improve its OER and ORR performance effectively, and the Pt@Sb monolayer can be a trifunctional electrocatalyst for the HER/OER/ORR. Therefore, our calculations highlight a new type of SAC based on antimonene, which can be useful for energy conversion and storage.									13	1	0	0	0	0	13			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000674881000001	34477772

Hydrous oxide materials prepared in this manner are typically quite amorphous in nature. Here, we show, using scanning electron microscopy and cyclic voltammetry, that a more uniform oxide growth can be achieved using a Nafion or carbon nanotube matrix as a template. This templated growth produces oxide films with unique surface morphologies and electrical properties. In particular, the composite films exhibit superior conductivity, as shown by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, with up to eightfold decrease in charge transfer resistance. The ultimate result is an enhancement in the electrocatalytic performance of the hydrous Fe oxide film. Steady-state polarisation studies on the oxygen evolution reaction show a reduction in overpotential of up to 50 mV for the composite electrodes with a threefold increase in turnover frequency.									15	1	0	0	0	1	16			1868-2529	1868-5994		WOS:000333024500002

In this work, we present a facile and straightforward method of incorporating NiCo-layered double hydroxide (NiCo-LDH) into GO-dispersed CNTs (GO-CNTs) with interconnected configuration. X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) reveals the strong electron interaction between NiCo-LDH and the underlying GO-CNTs substrate, which is supposed to facilitate charge transfer and accelerate the kinetics for OER. By tuning the amount of CNTs, the optimized NiCo-LDH/GO-CNTs composite can achieve a low overpotential of 290 mV at 10 mA.cm(-2) current density, a small Tafel slope of 66.8 mV.dec(-1) and robust stability, superior to the pure NiCo-LDH and commercial RuO2 in alkaline media. The preeminent oxygen evolution performance is attributed to the synergistic effect stemming from the merits and the intimate electron interaction between LDH and GO-CNTs. This allows NiCo-LDH/GO-CNTs to be potentially applied in an industrial non-noble metal-based water electrolyzer as the anodic catalysts.									15	0	0	0	0	0	14			1998-0124	1998-0000		WOS:000643200000001

However, while the HER has been immensely studied, the OER is limited. The chemistry in the OER is more complicated and involves irreversible surface oxidations of these materials and transforms them to their corresponding oxide/oxyhydroxide. Interestingly, these in situ changes have been widely observed generating more active catalysts with superior performance. Phosphides of Fe, Co, and Ni with different compositions have been proved as efficient catalysts for water oxidation. Considering their importance, structures, compositions, surface modifications, and also in situ transformation during electrolysis, this Perspective provides state-of-the-art views of their current developments and future prospects.									224	7	0	0	7	0	224			1948-7185			WOS:000391653200023	27981840

In this study, a series of iron-based phosphide catalysts (denoted as: P-X-doped Fe/NF) were prepared via one-step electrodeposition from a eutectic solvent to examine their oxygen evolution reaction (OER) or hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) performance. Notably, P-30-doped Fe/NF forms a porous interconnected nanosheet structure, providing a large active surface areas, abundant active sites and low charge transfer resistance. P-30-doped Fe/NF attained the lowest OER (284.15 mV) and HER (158.17 mV) overpotentials at 10 mA cm(-2) in 1.0 M KOH of all the tested catalysts. When used in overall water splitting, the catalyst displayed outstanding adaptability to a range of potentials and current densities.

In this work, we report two-dimensional (2D) ultra-thin Co9S8/MnS sulfur/nitrogen co-doped carbon nanosheets (Co9S8/MnS-USNC) with outstanding ORR and OER activities as well as remarkable stability in alkaline media. Benefiting from the accessible functional surface and active sites of the 2D structure and adjustment of the electronic structure by the synergetic effect, Co9S8/MnS-USNC possesses a half-wave potential of 0.90 V for the ORR and a low overpotential of 360 mV for the OER at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2).

The results are compared with those of a closely similar model that does not account for the phase transitions. Allowance for phase transitions shows many marked effects on the dynamic behavior of the SHS (which propagates in a steady mode under a wider range of dilution degrees) and on the macrokinetic parameters (space and time profiles of temperature and advancement degree of oxidation and time evolutions of wave speed and combustion temperature). These effects can be used for assessing the mechanism of an SHS from real experiments.									9	0	0	0	0	0	9			1520-6106			WOS:000176161900042

Therefore, we present a new strategy to form NiS/Ni2P heterostructures. The as-obtained NiS/Ni2P/carbon cloth (CC) requires overpotentials of 111 mV for the HER and 265 mV for the OER to reach a current density of 20 mA cm(-2), outperforming their counterparts such as NiS and Ni2P under the same conditions. Additionally, the NiS/Ni2P/CC electrode requires a 1.67 V cell voltage to deliver 10 mA cm(-2) in a two-electrode electrolysis system, which is comparable to the cell using the benchmark Pt/C parallel to RuO2 electrode. Detailed characterizations reveal that strong electronic interactions between NiS and Ni2P, abundant active sites, and smaller charge-transfer resistance contribute to the improved HER and OER activity.									222	8	0	0	8	0	223			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000424851600035	29333850

This screening shows that manganese and cobalt N-coordinated compounds are able to catalyze the oxygen evolution reaction. Mn hexacyanometalates show low activity. Co hexacyanometalates, in contrast, appear highly active and promote robust catalysis with excellent quantum yield (<= 88%), even in acidic media. Our results indicate that these catalysts are viable candidates for a photoactivated water oxidation process as part of an artificial photosynthesis scheme.									72	1	0	0	4	0	72			2155-5435			WOS:000337074700003

Here, we design high-density Ir single-atom catalysts supported by CoOx amorphous nanosheets (ANSs) for the OER. Experimental results show that Ir single atoms are anchored by abundant surface-absorbed O in CoOx ANSs. Ir single-atom catalysts possess ultrahigh mass activity that is 160-fold of commercial IrO2. The OER of IrCoOx ANSs reached a record low onset overpotential of less than 30 mV. In situ X-ray absorption spectroscopy reveals that Ir-O-Co pairs directly boosted the OER efficiency and enhanced the Ir stability.									60	1	0	0	0	0	60			2155-5435			WOS:000606833100012

Recent findings suggest that the incorporation of Fe3+ into a NiOOH lattice leads to nearly optimal adsorption energies for OER intermediates on active Fe sites. Utilizing electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and activation energy measurements, we find that pure NiOOH and FeOOH catalysts exhibit exceedingly high Faradaic resistances and activation energies 40-50 kJ/mol(-1) higher than those of the most active FexNi1-xOOH catalysts. Furthermore, the most active FexNi1-xOOH catalysts in this study exhibit activation energies that approach those previously reported for IrO2 OER catalysts.									222	9	0	0	11	0	225			1932-7447	1932-7455		WOS:000360026200022

Herein, a unique bimetallic nanocomposite CoNi(OH)(2)@NiCo2S4 nanosheet arrays derived from metal-organic-frameworks (MOFs, CoNi-ZIF) is simply fabricated on Ni foam, endowing large specific surface area and outstanding electrical conductivity. Compared with their single-metallic counterparts, the bimetallic composite displays dramatically low overpotential and small Tafel slope as well as outstanding catalytic stability. The overpoptential at 20 mA cm(-2) for CoNi(OH)(2)@NiCo2S4 is only 230 mV in comparison with Ni(OH)(2)@Ni3S2 (266 mV), Co(OH)(2)@Co3S4 (294 mV) and RuO2 (eta = 302 mV). First-principle calculations based on density functional theory (DFT) are carried out and reveal that the introduction of Ni in Co(OH)(2) helps lowered the energy difference of Delta G (OOH*)-Delta G (O*), and thereby boosting the OER reactivity.

Herein, Pd nanoparticles grown on Mo2C nanotubes were prepared as dual functional electrocatalysts for both ORR and HER. A series of samples with different Pd loadings were fabricated, while the morphology and the structural features were well examined by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). Interestingly, both the ORR activity and HER activity first increased then decreased with the increasing of Pd loading, and the sample of Mo2C-Pd-9% exhibited the best performance among the series, superior than commercial Pd/C in both ORR and HER tests. Furthermore it also exhibited markedly higher long-term stability than Pd/C for both electrocatalytic reactions.

In this study, amorphous Ni-Fe-P alloy was successfully synthesized by one-step direct-current electrodeposition method. The performance of Ni-Fe-P alloy as a bifunctional electrocatalyst toward both hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) was evaluated in 30 wt% KOH solution. It was found that Ni-Fe-P alloy exhibits excellent HER and OER performances, which delivers a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at overpotential of similar to 335 mV for HER and similar to 309 mV for OER with Tafel slopes of 63.7 and 79.4 mV dec(-1), respectively. Moreover, the electrolyzer only needs a cell voltage of similar to 1.62 V to achieve 10 mA cm(-2) for overall water splitting. The excellent electrocatalytic performance of Ni-Fe-P alloy is attributed to its electrochemically active constituents, amorphous structure, and the conductive Cu Foil.

The intrinsic difficulty of such studies is the fact that at electrode potentials where the OER is observed, the electrode material is highly oxidized. As a consequence, the surface structure during the reaction is in general ill-defined and only scarce knowledge exists concerning the structure-activity relationship of this important reaction. To alleviate these challenging conditions, we chose as starting point well-defined Pt single-crystal electrodes, which we exposed to well-defined conditioning before studying their OER rate. Using this approach, a potential region is identified where the OER on Pt is indeed structure-sensitive with Pt(100) being significantly more active than Pt(111). This experimental finding is in contrast to a DFT analysis of the adsorption strength of the reaction intermediates O*, OH*, and OOH* often used to plot the activity in a volcano curve. It is proposed that as a consequence of the highly oxidizing conditions, the structure-sensitive charge-transfer resistance through the interface determines the observed reaction rate.									9	1	0	0	1	0	9			1439-4235	1439-7641		WOS:000501279800032	30938896

In this work, a facile strategy to construct the VOOH/Ti3C2Tx MXene heterostructures is reported, benefiting from the optimized electronic structure and abundant heterogeneous interfaces that weakens the adsorption of oxygen-containing intermediates, as well as accelerating the dissociation of water molecules, thus facilitating the catalytic kinetics of the OER and HER. As expected, the VOOH/Ti3C2Tx MXene required overpotentials of 238 mV for the OER and 100 mV for the HER to reach a current density of 10 mA cm(-2). More importantly, by employing the VOOH/Ti3C2Tx MXene as both the anode and the cathode, a two-electrode alkaline electrolyzer delivers a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at a low cell voltage of 1.579 V, which is superior to the commercial IrO2||Pt/C couple. This work opens up appealing opportunities for the rational design of MXene-based hybrid materials for efficient H-2 production and other energy-related applications.									9	1	0	0	0	0	9			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000590158400045

Material surface and interface engineering provide a feasible approach to improve catalytic activity. Besides, self-supported electrocatalysts have been proven to be highly efficient toward water splitting, because of the regulated catalyst/substrate interface. In this Review, the state-of-the-art achievements in self-supported electrocatalyst for HER/OER have demonstrated the feasibility of surface and interface engineering strategies to boost performance. The six key effective surface/interface engineering approaches for rational catalysts design are systematically reviewed, including defect engineering, morphology engineering, crystallographic tailoring, heterostructure design, catalyst/substrate interface engineering, and catalyst/ electrolyte interface regulation.

However, the interaction between nanoparticles and perovskite supports is still unclear. Herein, we report a unique and simple strategy for enhancing OER activity based on ferrite (La0.9Fe0.92Ru0.08O3-delta, LFRO) nanofibrous architecture by in-situ growth of Ru/RuO2 nanoparticles. Hollow fibrous LFRO is synthesized by a modified electrospinning method. Ru and RuO2 nanoparticles anchor on the surface of LFRO substrate via a simple exsolution strategy. Benefiting from the synergic effect of the interaction of metal-metal oxides and large active surface area of hollow fibers, the nanofibrous LFRO electrode decorated by RuO2 nanoparticles delivers high electrocatalytic OER activity and durability. Meanwhile, KPFM measurement demonstrates that a low work function induced by plenty of oxygen vacancies could accelerate the charge transfer process and thus facilitate the OER kinetics. Our work provides insight into rational designing efficient hierarchical nanostructured electrocatalysts via a simplified in-situ growth method.									15	0	0	0	1	0	14			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000656154100003

Herein, we report the fabrication of phosphorus-doped monoclinic beta-CoMoO4 (P-CoMoO4) on nickel foam as a high-efficiency and bifunctional electrocatalyst for overall water splitting in alkaline electrolyte. Surface reconstruction of P-CoMoO4 is witnessed and carefully investigated, which is converted into Co(OH)2-CoMoO4/ P-CoMoO4 during the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) process, and into CoOOH/P-CoMoO4 during the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) process. Notably, the reconstructed catalyst exhibits ultralow overpotentials of 44 mV to achieve a current density of 10 mA cm-2 for HER, and 260 mV to deliver a current density of 20 mA cm-2 for OER. Meanwhile, it only needs a small cell voltage of 1.54 V at 10 mA cm-2 for robust water splitting with outstanding long-term durability over 72 h at 50 mA cm-2.

In the meantime, the S-C3N4-CNT-CF was also proven to be an efficient, stable metal-free electrode for the HER.

Herein, a simple, cost-fairness, and general fluorination strategy is developed to realize surface reconstruction, heteroatom doping, and vacancies engineering over cobalt phosphide (CoP) for acquiring high-performance bifunctional electrocatalysts. Specifically, the surface of CoP nanoarrays (NAs) becomes rougher, meanwhile F doped into CoP lattice and creating amounts of P vacancies by fluorination, which caused the increase of active sites and regulation of charge distribution, resulting the excellent electrocatalyst performance of F-CoP NAs/copper foam (CF). The optimized F-CoP NAs/CF delivers a lower overpotential of only 35 mV at 10 mA.cm(-2) for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and 231 mV at 50 mA.cm(-2) for oxygen evolution reaction (OER), and the corresponding overall water splitting requires only 1.48 V cell voltage at 10 mA.cm(-2), which are superior to the most state-of-the-art reported electrocatalysts.

However, understanding how SACs function at the molecular level remains a huge challenge. Here, we report a general approach to anchor Pt single-atom intercalated in layered double hydroxide (LDH) and decipher the alternating synergy between Pt single-atom and Ni3Fe LDH support for overall water splitting. Aided with Tafel slope, interface species evolution and control experiments, operando electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) can distinguish interface charge transport and elementary reactions during hydrogen and oxygen evolution reactions (HER and OER). For HER, interlayer Pt single-atom vastly enhances electron transferability of LDH support, and Ni3Fe LDH support accelerates water dissociation, thus resulting in a mixture of mechanisms (Heyrovsky-Volmer and Tafel-Volmer) in 1 M KOH. For OER, interlayer Pt single-atom not only prompts active phase transition from NiFe LDH to Ni2+delta Fe3+zeta OxHy, but also optimizes OER intrinsic activity of Ni2+delta-O-Fe(3+zeta )in Ni2+delta Fe3+zeta OxHy. Overall, we provide a referential paradigm for SACs synthesis strategy and unscrambling its alternating synergy.									34	1	0	0	1	0	34			1754-5692	1754-5706		WOS:000712002700001

The results of X-ray diffractometry, transmission electron microscope, scanning electron microscope and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy verify the successful decoration of Co(OH)(2) electrocatalysts onto the surface of TiO2. Moreover, photoelectrocatalytic measurements illustrate that the Co(OH)(2)-decorated TiO2 shows higher current density than pure TiO2 sample.

However, the supercapacitors based on CoMoO 4 electrodes generally show low conductivity and poor cycling stability. Here, we report Mo-based hybrid structures through an efficient anion exchange strategy. The as-obtained CoMoO4@Co1.62Mo6S8 samples possess a specific capacitance of 665 C/g at 1 A/g. The as-assembled hybrid capacitor keeps a capacitance retention of 99.5% after 10,000 cycles. As electro-catalysts, the above electrode materials demonstrate an overpotential of 200 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) for oxygen evolution reaction.

In this communication, we report a novel bifunctional electrocatalyst based on cobalt nanoparticles (NPs) embedded in porous N-rich carbon (PNC/Co) derived from a cobalt-containing metal-organic framework, which can serve as both active cathode and anode materials to drive the overall water splitting in alkaline media for the simultaneous electrogeneration of hydrogen and oxygen gases. In 1.0 M KOH electrolyte, the PNC/Co achieves small overpotentials at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) and yields high faradaic efficiency towards both the HER and OER.

Herein, a bipyridine-containing covalent organic framework (TpBpy) is utilized as an OER catalyst by way of engineering active Co(II) ions into its porous framework. The as-obtained Co-TpBpy retains a highly accessible surface area (450 m(2)/g) with exceptional stability, even after 1000 cycles and 24 h of OER activity in phosphate buffer under neutral pH conditions with an overpotential of 400 mV at a current density of 1 mA/cm(2). The unusual catalytic stability of Co-TpBpy arises from the synergetic effect of the inherent porosity and presence of coordinating units in the COF skeleton.									252	12	0	0	24	0	255			0897-4756	1520-5002		WOS:000378973100031

Here, we report the design and successful fabrication of a high performance self-supported cogwheel arrays-like nanoporous IrxRu1-xO2 catalyst with abundant atomic steps for acidic OER using a facile alloy-spinningelectrochemical activation method that allows large-scale fabrication. The obtained IrxRu1-xO2 catalysts merely need overpotentials of 211 and 295 mV to deliver catalytic current densities of 10 and 300 mA.cm(-2) in 0.5 M H2SO4, respectively, and can sustain constant OER electrolysis for at least 140 h at a high current density of 300 mA.cm(-2). Further density functional theory (DFT) calculations uncover that such high intrinsic activities mainly originate from the largely exposed high-index atomic step planes, which markedly lower the limiting potential of the rate-determining step (RDS) of OER. These findings provide an insight into the exploration of high performance electrocatalysts, and open up an avenue for further developing the state-of-the-art Ir and/or Ru-based catalysts for large-scale practical applications.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1998-0124	1998-0000		WOS:000779615200001

In the oxygen evolution reaction(OER), owing to the correlation nature of the TMO, strain can effectively tunethe OER performance by modulating the electron occupancy and strengtheningthe exchange/coupling. However, the surface strain condition declines alongwith the rapid release of the interfacial lattice mismatch in conventional rigidTMO thinfilm. This not only restricts obtaining the most prominent straintunability toward OER but also hinders understanding the fundamentalmechanism. Here in this study, we have employed a van der Waals LaNiO3(LNO) membrane to determine the in situ strain effect on OER performance.We found that the OER activity is dramatically improved with both compressiveand tensile strains exhibiting an ambipolar trend. Under only 0.2% compressiveand tensile strains, the current densities are, respectively, enhanced similar to 121% and similar to 92% at 400 mV overpotential, compared with theunstrained LNO scenario. The weakened Ni-O chemisorption and enhanced charge transfer of LNO under varied strain conditionsare responsible for this OER enhancement.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			2155-5435			WOS:000784255800037

Results show that introduction of Fe for Cr from 0.25 to 0.75 mol into the Cr-2(MoO4)(3) matrix improved the electrocatalytic activity toward the O-2 evolution reaction (OER) in 1 M KOH considerably; the magnitude of improvement being maximum with 0.5 mol Fe. Values of the Tafel slope were close to 35 mV at low and 2.303RT/F at high overpotentials on Fe-substituted oxides. The OER follows nearly second order kinetics in OH- concentration at low overpotentials. Copyright (C) 2012, Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Herein, we demonstrate a rational wet-chemical route to fabricate a novel LaCoO3/N-doped reduced graphene oxide (LaCoO3/NrGO) nanohybrid with improved performances as a bifunctional electrocatalyst for ORR and OER. The assynthesized LaCoO3/N-rGO affords overwhelmingly superior ORR and OER electrocatalytic properties in comparison with LaCoO3, N-rGO and LaCoO3/reduced graphene oxide (LaCoO3/rGO). As compared with the most acknowledgedly efficient Pt-based bifunctional eletrocatalysts, e.g. 20 wt% Pt/C, LaCoO3/N-rGO displays a far higher OER activity associated with remarkably enhanced ORR and OER durabilities. Moreover, LaCoO3/N-rGO holds a better durability and a more rapid OER rate than those of the benchmark OER electrocatalyst RuO2. The improved ORR and OER electrocatalytic performances for LaCoO3/NrGO stem from the diminished size of LaCoO3 on rGO, reinforced synergistic effect between LaCoO3 and rGO, efficient N doping, and significantly low ohmic and kinetic impedances. This design strategy can be extended to construct composites of other perovskite-type oxides and carbonaceous materials, thereby providing the foundation for the developments of bifunctional eletrocatalysts in the rechargeable metal-air batteries.

Herein, we present the preparation of hierarchically structured multi-elements water splitting electrocatalysts consisting of Fe, Co, Ni, S, P, and O with a one-step electrodeposition method. By tuning of the non-metal compositions of the catalysts, the electrochemical performances of the catalysts for both the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in 1 M KOH can be rationally modified, respectively. Under the optimum conditions, current densities of 100 and 1000 mA cm(-2) were obtained at overpotentials of only 135 and 264 mV on the HER catalyst and 258 and 360 mV on the OER catalyst, respectively. When the best-performing HER and OER catalysts were assembled in a two-electrode system for overall water splitting, a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) could be obtained under a cell voltage of 1.46 V with longterm durability. As far as we know, this is among the lowest voltages ever reported for a two-electrode electrolyzer based upon earth-abundant, elements. Moreover, the catalysts can be facilely assembled on commercially available Ni mesh and demonstrate even higher performance, indicating their great potential for scaled-up water electrolysis. We further demonstrate that S and P play different and pivotal roles in modifying the apparent and intrinsic electrocatalytic activity of the as-prepared amorphous electrocatalysts, therefore pointing out a pathway toward the optimization of multi-elements catalysts.									85	5	0	0	1	0	85			2155-5435			WOS:000449723900003

In this work, we adopt a facile solid-liquid-phase chemical method to yield hollow Ru-RuPx-CoxP polyhedra. Herein, the in-situ introduced Ru can induce the surface reconstruction of Co2P into Ru-RuPx-CoxP polyhedra due to unstable surface terminations proved by X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and Line-scan electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS) analyses. As expected, Ru-RuPx-CoxP with large specific surface area and abundant active sites shows remarkable high OER catalytic activity (eta(10) = 291 mV) and stability (at least 10000 cycles). DFT calculations further demonstrate that the presence of Ru metal promotes the electrocatalytic reaction kinetics through increasing the density of states at the Fermi level with reduced intermediate adsorption energy and improving electron transfer.									101	8	0	0	5	0	102			2211-2855	2211-3282		WOS:000448994600033

The absorption maxima that were found in the carbonyl and hydroxyl regions of the infrared were assigned, and the corresponding photoproducts were identified. These studies show that the photochemical evolution of PC mainly involves two successive photo-Fries rearrangements, a photo-induced oxidation on the side-chain and a phenyl ring oxidation. These multiple reaction pathways are shown to be largely dependent upon the spectral distribution of the excitation light source and whether oxygen is present.					19th Annual Meeting of the Polymer-Degradation-Discussion-Group19th Annual Meeting of the Polymer-Degradation-Discussion-Group	SEP, 1994SEP, 1994	Polym Degradat Discuss GrpPolym Degradat Discuss Grp	BRIGHTON, ENGLANDBRIGHTON, ENGLAND	116	8	0	0	9	1	124			0141-3910			WOS:A1995RW19900019

Our combined experimental measurements and density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that TM-PBAs exhibit volcano-like OER activity with Ni-PBA located near the top of the volcano. Such a volcano-like activity profile can be attributed to the distinctive binding energy difference between *O and *OH on different TM-PBAs surfaces. This work demonstrates that TM-PBAs can be used as platform materials for understanding structure-property-activity relationships in OER catalysts. (C) 2020 Elsevier Inc.

J	Yang, Jiangtao; Xuan, Haicheng; Zhang, Guohong; Wang, Rui; Yang, Jiale; Liang, Xiaohong; Li, Yuping; Han, Peide								The 3D core-shell heterostructure catalysts by CoNiS nanosheets interfacial assembled on CuO nanorods for efficient water electrolysis								APPLIED SURFACE SCIENCE				570						151181	10.1016/j.apsusc.2021.151181		SEP 2021		DEC 30 2021	2021	The development of high-efficiency electrocatalysts is one of the important ways to mass-produce hydrogen but still confronts many challenges. Herein, a 3D core-shell heterostructure catalyst is rationally designed by interfacial assembled of CoNiS nanosheets on CuO nanorods (CuO@CoNiS NRs). The 3D core-shell hetero-structure significantly increases the electrochemical surface area, enabling more active centers to be exposed and facilitating the charge transfer, thus boosting catalytic activity. The catalyst requires low overpotential for HER (96 mV) and OER (246 mV) to achieve 10 mA cm-2 in 1 M KOH. It is capable of attaining 200 mA cm-2 with only 206 mV for HER and achieving 100 mA cm-2 with 314 mV for OER. Meanwhile, CuO@CoNiS NRs as a water electrolyzer to generate 10 mA cm-2 requires a low voltage of 1.52 V. This work provides an effective strategy for developing efficient non-noble metal catalysts by reasonable construction of nanostructure and heterogeneous interface.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000711224900005

In this work, we report that 2D Co2P@Co3O4 microsheets can be prepared through an in-situ toptactic conversion from single-crystal (beta-Co (OH)(2) microplatelets, associated with a surface phosphatization and corrosion process. The resultant Co2P@Co3O4 2D hybrid materials can further serve as self-supported bifunctional catalytic electrodes to drive the overall water splitting for HER and OER simultaneously, with low overpotentials and high long-term stability. Furthermore, a water electrolyzer based on Co2P@(CoO4)-O-3 hybrid as both anode and cathode is fabricated, which achieves 10 mA cm(-2) current at only 1.57 V during water splitting process. Therefore, this work provides a facile strategy to obtain 2D Co2P-based micro/nanostructures, which act as low-cost and highly active electrocatalysts towards overall water splitting application.									74	6	0	0	7	0	74			0378-7753	1873-2755		WOS:000418391900018

Developing electrocatalysts with high activity, stability, and low cost to reduce the overpotential and improve electrocatalytic efficiency is a pressing task currently. MOF materials have stood out among various electrocatalysts for their tunable coordi-nation structures and metal atom environments that impose essential influence on the practical catalytic per-formance. Here, we have concluded and discussed the most pivotal advances in engineering MOF nanoarchitectures for efficient water electrolysis thoroughly. First, we give a comprehensive overview for the modulation of coordination structures and metal atom environments in MOF and MOF-derived catalysts. Sub-sequently, their applications in water splitting are discussed according to the coordination structure and the local atomic environment. We hope this timely review will provide critical information and insights for the further exploration of MOF-based/-derived electrocatalysts for water electrolysis.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000870986400001

Here, we report that ternary transition metal boride Co-Ni-B is an active candidate catalyst for water splitting. The Co-Ni-B nanoparticles were deposited on Ni foam (NF) by a facile electroless plating method. After being properly calcined under an Ar atmosphere, the Co-Ni-B@NF catalyst exhibits a low overpotential along with high stability in alkaline solutions for the oxygen evolution reaction, which is among the best reported levels for non-precious metal catalysts. Furthermore, the properly annealed Co-Ni-B@NF catalyst also shows good activity towards the hydrogen evolution reaction. The potential of Co-Ni-B@NF as a bifunctional catalyst for the overall water splitting was demonstrated, with 10 mA cm(-2) achieved at 1.72 V. The favorable combination of high catalytic activity, facile preparation and low cost makes Co-Ni-B@NF a very promising bifunctional catalyst for electrochemical water splitting.									176	9	0	0	6	0	177			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000403664800044

In this study, we present a new type of Fe(SexS1-x)(2) nanorod bundles, which were successfully synthesized via a simple one-step hydrothermal method. We further demonstrate the applicability of these structures as electrocatalysts for OER application. We reveal that the incorporation of S into FeSe2 cause lattice strain and lattice defect, which is beneficial to expose more active sites and optimize the electronic structure, and hence the Fe(SexS1-x)(2) composites display favorable catalytic for OER. More interestingly, the as-prepared Fe(Se0.5S0.5)(2) catalyst exhibits the best OER performance with an overpotential at 10 mA.cm(-2) of 247 mV, a low tafel slope of 54 mV/dec, and excellent catalytic stability. This work is expected to open a new door to discover other Fe-based materials as efficient catalysts for renewable energy.									16	0	0	0	3	0	16			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000655665200002

Here we report the rational design and synthesis of a double perovskite PrBa0.5Sr0.5Co1.5Fe0.5O5+delta nanofiber as a highly efficient and robust catalyst for the oxygen evolution reaction. Co-doping of strontium and iron into PrBaCo2O5+delta is found to be very effective in enhancing intrinsic activity (normalized by the geometrical surface area, similar to 4.7 times), as validated by electrochemical measurements and first-principles calculations. Further, the nanofiber morphology enhances its mass activity remarkably (by similar to 20 times) as the diameter is reduced to similar to 20 nm, attributed to the increased surface area and an unexpected intrinsic activity enhancement due possibly to a favourable eg electron filling associated with partial surface reduction, as unravelled from chemical titration and electron energy-loss spectroscopy.									263	5	0	0	28	0	265			2041-1723			WOS:000394796900001	28240282

In this report, 3D ternary nickel iron sulfide microflowers with a hierarchically porous structure directly grown on Ni foam via a convenient two-step method have been fabricated, and further used as an efficient electrocatalyst for both the HER and the OER. Thanks to the unique 3D morphology and strong electron interactions between Fe, Ni and S, the as-synthesized Ni0.7Fe0.3S2 delivers an overpotential of 198 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) toward the OER in alkaline media, which is, to the best of our knowledge, the best among the reported non-noble metal based electrocatalysts.

Herein, we report a ZnO-based template method to fabricate Ni nanotube arrays (NTAs) anchored on nickel foil for applications in the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER). On the basis of this precursor electrode, the three-dimensional NiSe2 NTAs of unique sandwich-like coaxial structure have been fabricated by electrodeposition of NiSe2 on Ni NTAs, which exhibits high performance toward the HER in both acidic and alkaline media. The method based on Ni NTAs can be readily extended to fabricate Ni2P NTAs by gas-solid phosphorization for the HER, and NiFeOx NTAs by anodic codeposition of Ni and Fe for the OER. Consequently, an alkaline electrolyzer has been constructed using NiFeOx NTAs and NiSe2 NTAs as anode and cathode, respectively, which can realize overall water splitting with a current density of 100 mA cm(-1) at an overpotential of 510 mV.									31	2	0	0	1	0	31			2168-0485			WOS:000424728300060

J	Gai, Moshe								Ambiguities in the rate of oxygen formation during stellar helium burning in the C-12(alpha,gamma) reaction								PHYSICAL REVIEW C				88	6					062801	10.1103/PhysRevC.88.062801				DEC 4 2013	2013	The rate of oxygen formation determines the C/O ratio during stellar helium burning. It is the single most important nuclear input in stellar evolution theory, including the evolution of type II and type Ia supernova. However, the low-energy cross section of the fusion of He-4 + C-12, denoted as the C-12(alpha, gamma)O-16 reaction, still remains uncertain. I analyze and critically review the most recent measurements of complete angular distributions of the outgoing gamma rays at very low energies (E-c.m. >= 1.0 MeV). My analysis of the angular distributions measured with the EUROGAM/GANDI arrays leads to considerably larger error bars than have been published, which excludes them from the current sample of "world data." I show that the current sample of "world data" of the measured E2 cross-section factors below 1.7 MeV cluster into two distinct groups that lead to two distinct extrapolations: S-E2(300) approximate to 60 or S-E2(300) approximate to 154 keVb. There is a discrepancy between the measured E1-E2 phase difference (phi(12)) and unitarity as required by the Watson theorem, which suggests systematic problem(s) in some of the measured gamma-ray angular distributions. The ambiguity of the extrapolated S-E2(300) together with the previously observed ambiguity of S-E1(300) (approximately 80 or 10 keVb) must be resolved by future measurements of complete and detailed angular distributions of the C-12(alpha, gamma) reaction at very low energies (E-c.m. <= 1.0 MeV).									17	0	0	0	1	0	17			0556-2813	1089-490X		WOS:000328581500001

This oxide has a porous structure and a specific surface area of 10.24 m(2) g(-1) after ball-milled 24 h. The catalytic activity of the oxide for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in 0.1 M KOH solution has been studied by using a rotating ring-disk electrode (RRDE) technique. RRDE results show that the ORR mainly favors a direct four electron pathway, and a maximum cathodic current density of -5.70 mA cm(-2) at 2500 rpm was obtained, which is close to that of Pt/C (20 wt.% Pt on carbon) electrocatalyst in the same testing conditions. Compared with behaviors of pure C and Pt/C electrode, a lower onset potential of BCFN for OER is observed, and a bigger anodic current at the same applied potential is obtained. Considering small surface area of the BCFN catalyst, a big overpotential is given in the discharge-charge curves. However, the outputs of 2032 coin Li-air batteries in a dry gas mixture composed of 80 vol.% pure N-2 and 20 vol.% pure O-2 demonstrated that BCFN could be a potential bifunctional catalyst for the Li-air battery.

The stellar sequences were evolved through the advanced burning phases up to the end of core oxygen burning. We present a careful analysis of the physical characteristics of the stellar models. In particular, we investigate the effect of the still-unsettled reaction C-12(alpha, gamma)O-16 on the advanced evolution by using recent compilations of this rate. We find that this rate has a significant impact on the evolution not only during the core helium burning phase but also during the late burning phases, especially the shell carbon burning. We have also considered the effect of different treatments of convective instability based on the Ledoux criterion in regions of varying molecular weight gradient during the hydrogen- and helium-burning phases. We compare our results with other investigations whenever available. Finally, our present study constitutes the basis of analyzing the nucleosynthesis processes in massive stars. In particular, we will present a detailed analysis of the s-process in a forthcoming paper.									48	1	1	0	0	0	49			0004-637X	1538-4357		WOS:000223236000035

Additionally, the active substance directly grown on current collector without binder using can enhance conductivity and accelerate the charge transport. Beneficial from the above merits, the as-obtained Cu(OH)(2) exhibits outstanding UOR performance with a potential of 1.49 V at 10 mA cm(-2), lower than 1.62 V for oxygen evolution reaction (OER), small Tafel slopes of 86 mV dec(-1), and good long-term stability. This work firstly indicates that Cu-based electrocatalysts have the promising application for excellent UOR performance and urea-rich wastewater treatment.									14	0	0	0	2	0	14			0254-0584	1879-3312		WOS:000514749800070

Under UV light, both water splitting and solar ammonia synthesis reaction exhibit high activity. However, selectivity towards ammonia over hydrogen is realized under NIR irradiation. With the control of methanol, O-2 can directly decide the NH3 or H-2 evolution on photocatalyst. The origin is the strong capture of O-2 with the electrons from the photocatalyst under light irradiation to yield the oxygen active species, which transfer electrons subsequently with help of methanol to generate NH3. However, H-2 production will be suppressed by O-2. And with its sacrifice, methanol preserves the produced NH3 from oxidation. The O-2-sacrificial agent mediated NH3 evolution reaction found here provides insights in the promotion role of them in other catalysis.									40	1	0	0	3	0	41			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000438478900020

Herein, a family of bimetal (CoFe, CoCu, CoNi) embedded nitrogen-doped carbon frameworks is developed through a facile and simple thermal conversion strategy of metal-doped zeolitic imidazolate frameworks. Thanks to collaborative superiorities of abundant M-N-C species, modulation action of secondary metal, cobalt-based electroactive phases, template effect of MOFs and unique porous structure, bimetal embedded nitrogen-doped carbon frameworks materials manifest good oxygen and hydrogen evolution catalytic activity. Especially, after modulating the species and molar ratio of metal sources, optimal Co(0.7)sFe(0.25) nitrogen-doped carbon framework catalyst just requires a low overpotential of 303 mV to achieve 10 mA cm(-2) with a low Tafel slope (39.49 mV dec(-1)) for oxygen evolution reaction, which even surpasses that of commercial RuO2. In addition, the optimal catalyst can function as an efficient bifunctional electrocatalyst for overall water splitting with satisfying activity and stability. This development offers an attractive direction for the rational design and fabrication of porous carbon materials for electrochemical energy applications.									76	3	0	0	4	0	78			0378-7753	1873-2755		WOS:000433267100028

The effects of the concentration of Nd2O3, temperature, electrode area on the oxidation of oxygen ions and critical potential have been discussed. Oxidation processes of oxygen ions include adsorption and gas evolution of oxidation products, which is proved by the the smooth and fluctuant cyclic voltammograms. During adsorption process, both the peak current density and the peak potential of oxidation of oxygen ions increase with the increase of Nd2O3 concentration. The peak current density of oxidation of oxygen ions displays a linearity within 2.5wt% Nd2O3 in the melt. The kinetics of the oxidation of oxygen ions is controlled by both electrochemical reaction step and mass transfer. During gas evolution, the oxidation process of oxygen ions is controlled by electrochemical reaction step. Oxidation of flouride ions starts from the critical potential. The critical potential by reverse scan is independent of the electrode area, but depends on electrode area by positive scan. Increasing temperature causes significantly increased the adsoprtion current density for oxidation of oxygen ions. At 950 degrees C, after the critical potential relatively big current peaks involving formaiton of perflouride compounds occurs after the cirtical potential. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

However, the slow kinetics of OER limit the performance and commercialization of such devices. Herein, we report on NiFe LDH@Au hybrid nanoarrays on Ni foam for much enhanced OER. By hybridization electronegative Au and NiFe LDH with intrinsic remarkable OER catalytic activity, this modular electrode could drive an overall ultrahigh-performance and robust OER in base with the demand of overpotentials of only 221, 235, and 270 mV to afford 50, 100, and 500 mA cm(-2), respectively.

Herein, an effective and facile two-step route is developed to construct Fe3O4@NiSx composite loaded on reduced graphene oxide (rGO). The morphology and microstructure of the composites were characterized by different characterization techniques. The obtained composites show amounts of heterointer-faces. The shift of binding energy in X-ray photoelectron spectrum demonstrates the existence of interfacial charge transfer effect between Fe3O4 and NiSx. The optimized Fe3O4@NiSx/rGO sample exhibits excellent electrocatalytic performance toward OER in alkaline media, showing 10 mA.cm (2) at eta = 330 mV, lower Tafel slope (35.5 mV.dec (1)), and good durability, demonstrating a great perspective. The excellent OER performance can be ascribed to the synergetic effect between Fe and Ni species. It is believed that the heterointerfaces between Fe3O4 and NiSx perform as active centers for OER.

The catalytic performance for direct epoxidation of propylene is well related to surface adsorbed electrophilic oxygen species. Herein, we prepared a series of Mn-doped La2CuO4 perovskites (LaMnxCu1-xO3) with adjustable valence electronic structure as selective catalysts to explore the impacts of catalyst intrinsic electronic structure evolution on the activation of molecular oxygen. Therein, LaMn0.5Cu0.5O3 performed the best with a PO selectivity of 74.2% at 150 degrees C. The characterization results and DFT calculations revealed that the excellent catalytic performance of LaMn0.5Cu0.5O3 might be ascribed to the change of molecular oxygen activation sites: from oxygen vacancy active sites on La2CuO4 to Cu active sites on LaMn0.5Cu0.5O3. Meanwhile, there was a synergistic interaction between manganese and copper affecting the electron density on Cu sites and ultimately modulating the activated states of surface adsorbed oxygen species. In addition, we employed crystal band theory to associate the oxygen vacancy density with the Cu valence state. This is important for people to understand the bulk electronic structure evolution rules caused by transition metal doping and to design catalysts efficiently for oxygen-based chemical reactions.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			2044-4753	2044-4761		WOS:000752463800001

Herein, we report a novel kind of three-dimensional Co9S8/WS2 electrocatalyst with array structures as efficient bifunctional electrocatalysts for overall water splitting. The resulting hierarchically Co9S8/WS2, as a robust integrated 3D hydrogen-evolving electrode, can deliver a current density of 10 mA cm(geometric) (area)-2 at an overpotential of 138 mV in alkaline media, together with high stability. Combined with density functional theory calculations, the superior electrocatalytic activity is attributed to the unique structures and synergistic effect of chemical and electronic couplings between Co9S8 and WS2. Furthermore, this bifunctional electrode enables a high-performance alkaline water electrolyzer with 10 mA cm(-2) at a cell voltage of 1.65 V. Therefore, this unique 3D architecture opens an exciting new avenue to explore the use of composite sulfides toward full water splitting.									93	5	0	0	5	0	94			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000415070100054

In this work, we report a novel free-standing Cu2S branch array via a facile TiO2-induced electrodeposition-sulfurization method. Interestingly, cross-linked Cu2S nanoflake branch is strongly anchored on the TiO2 backbone forming high-quality Cu2S/TiO2/Cu2S core-branch arrays. The branch formation mechanism is also proposed. As compared to the pure Cu2S nanowire arrays, the as-prepared Cu2S/TiO2/Cu-2 S core-branch arrays show much better alkaline OER performance with lower overpotential (284 mV at 10 mA cm(-2)) and smaller Tafel slope (72 dec(-1)) as well as enhanced long-term durability mainly due to larger exposed area and more active electrocatalytic sites. Our work provides a new way for construction of advanced metal sulphide electrocatalysts for electrochemical energy conversion.

J	Bravo, E.								16O(p,alpha)13N makes explosive oxygen burning sensitive to the metallicity of the progenitors of type Ia supernovae [arXiv]								arXiv								5 pp.	5 pp.						2 July 2019	2019	Even though the main nucleosynthetic products of type Ia supernovae belong to the iron-group, intermediate-mass alpha-nuclei (silicon, sulfur, argon, and calcium) stand out in their spectra up to several weeks past maximum brightness. Recent measurements of the abundances of calcium, argon, and sulfur in type Ia supernova remnants have been interpreted in terms of metallicity-dependent oxygen burning, in accordance with previous theoretical predictions. It is known that alpha-rich oxygen burning results from 16Orarr12C followed by efficient 12C+12C fusion reaction, as compared to oxygen consumption by 16O fusion reactions, but the precise mechanism of dependence on the progenitor metallicity has remained unidentified so far. I show that the chain 16O(p,alpha)13N(gamma,p)12C boosts alpha-rich oxygen burning when the proton abundance is large, increasing the synthesis of argon and calcium with respect to sulfur and silicon. For high-metallicity progenitors, the presence of free neutrons leads to a drop in the proton abundance and the above chain is not efficient. Although the rate of 16O(p,alpha)13N can be found in astrophysical reaction rate libraries, its uncertainty is unconstrained. Assuming that all reaction rates other than 16O(p,alpha)13N retain their standard values, an increase by a factor of approximately seven of the 16O(p,alpha)13N rate at temperatures in the order 3 - 5 times 109 K is enough to explain the whole range of calcium-to-sulfur mass ratios measured in Milky Way and LMC supernova remnants. These same measurements provide a lower limit to the 16O(p,alpha)13N rate in the mentioned temperature range, on the order of a factor of 0.5 with respect to the rate reported in widely used literature tabulations.

In this work, the relative stability of O* and OOH* intermediates was a key factor in determining the ORR pathway; accordingly, ORR follows a two-step reaction pathway governed by O* rather than a four-step reaction pathway governed by OOH*. In addition, we found that P and S codoped C3N4 shows superior OER/ORR activity with synergistic geometric and electronic effects, which coordinatively increase unsaturated sp(3)-C via structural deformation and improve electrical conductance by modulating the electronic structure with extra electrons from dopants. In particular, PCSC-C3N4 (C3N4 with P and S codoped at the carbon site) shows better bifunctional performance of OER/ORR with competitive overpotentials at 0.42 and 0.27 V, respectively, compared to conventional Pt and RuO2 catalysts. Therefore, our theoretical investigations suggest that PCSC-C3N4 is the most promising bifunctional OER/ORR electrocatalyst with synergistic effects in several electrochemical devices.									43	2	0	0	4	0	43			2168-0485			WOS:000429285800061

The synergistic effect divulged by the individual components, i.e., RGO, FCNT, and VS4, significantly improves the efficiency of the ternary (RGO/FCNT/VS4) hybrid toward the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The ternary composite exhibits an impressive electrocatalytic OER performance in 1 M KOH and requires only 230 mV overpotential to reach the state-of-the-art current density (10 mA cm(-2)). Additionally, the hybrid shows an appreciable Tafel slope with a higher Faradaic efficiency (97.55 +/- 2.3%) at an overpotential of 230 mV. Further, these experimental findings are corroborated by the state-of-the-art density functional theory by presenting adsorption configurations, the density of states, and the overpotential of these hybrid structures.

Herein, the cobalt (Co)-modified MoS2 hybrid catalysts grown on nickel foam (NF) are successfully synthesized by a facile solvothermal method. The optimized catalyst (denoted as Co-Mo-S-2/NF) shows excellent HER activity with low overpotentials of 77 and 96 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2), as well as excellent stability with negligible loss of the cathodic current after 3000 cycles in 1.0 M KOH and 1.0 M phosphate-buffered saline (pH = 7), respectively. Significantly, when used as OER catalyst, the Co-Mo-S-2/NF hybrid also displays outstanding OER activity with a low overpotential of 294 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) and good long-term stability for 120 h at 10 mA cm(-2) without observable fading under alkaline condition. The excellent electrocatalytic activity of the generated catalyst is mainly due to abundant active site, large active area, improved conductivity, and synergistic effect within MoS2, Co9S8, and CoMoS3.13. This work provides a unique strategy to design the high-performance and stable electrocatalysts for HER and OER.									19	2	0	0	2	0	19			2196-7350			WOS:000471079000014

Herein, a unique Ni-Mo based metal/ oxide heterostructure with abundant mesopores was reported, which enables the interfacial Ni atoms exposed extensively. Atomic-scale structure characterization combined with density functional theory calculation revealed that the interfacial Ni exhibit an enriched charge state, endowing optimized adsorption strength to the intermediates in alkaline hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). As a result, this catalyst recorded an ultralow overpotential of 16 mV@10 mA/cm(2), addressing one of the best activities for alkaline HER. Interestingly, this synthetic strategy was extended to synthesize Fe-doped metal/oxide heterostructure that exhibited remarkable oxygen evolution reaction (OER) performance as well. As a proof-of-concept, the prepared catalysts were assembled in an electrolyzer, which delivered exceptional overall water splitting performance and even exceeds the Pt||RuO2 cell, demonstrating a promising platform for further catalyst design.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000807340900004

The Mn oxidation state optimization and structural defect engineering are essential to get a highly active Mn-based catalytic materials. MnP showed a good water oxidation activity with a lower overpotential of 286 mV to reach the current density of 10 mA/cm(2) and a Tafel slope of 76 mV/dec. Also, the electron transfer number calculated from both the rotating disk electrode and rotating ring-disk electrode techniques is a quasi-4 electron transfer process with an onset and halfwave potential of 0.998 V and 0.936 V vs RHE respectively. MnP achieved a higher limiting kinetic current of 5.7 mA/cm(2) and a very low H2O2 yield of 1.6 %. Chronoamperometry and cyclic voltammetry studies confirmed the long-term stability and durability of the prepared catalyst. The variance metrics Delta E [Ej(10)-Ej(-3)] is used to estimate the overall activity from the potential difference between OER overpotential at 10 mA/cm(2) and ORR kinetic current at 3 mA/cm(2). MnP shows very low Delta E (0.58 V) which demonstrate an efficient bifunctional activity in ORR and OER reactions. This work might shed new light on the development of MnP based bifunctional oxygen electrocatalyst.									24	2	0	0	1	0	24			1867-3880	1867-3899		WOS:000528050700028

Recent studies have been focused on searching for stable electrode materials for rechargeable Li-O-2 batteries with high efficiency and long cycle life. Here Pd-functionalized MnOx-GeOy nanomembranes were fabricated as the cathode materials of Li-O-2 batteries. The incorporation of Pd nanoparticles on the nanomembranes matrix enables the fast transportation of both electrons and lithium ions as well as oxygen-containing species, thus efficiently lowering the charge voltage and greatly prolonging the cycle life of Li-O-2 batteries to 160 cycles without apparent degradation. More importantly, Li-O-2 batteries using such as-prepared Pd-functionalized MnOx-GeOy nanomembranes can be cycled repeatedly with extremely low charge voltage of only 3.14 V. The presence of small amounts of Pd nanoparticles contributes to the formation of toroid-like Li2O2 during the oxygen reduction reaction which is efficiently decomposed afterwards by the oxygen evolution reaction. The encouraging performance suggests that such nanomembrane-based materials are promising cathode architectures for the future Li-O-2 batteries.

Herein, Ni3S2/Co3S4/FeOOH flower-like microspheres composed of Ni3S2/Co3S4 nanosheets and FeOOH nanoparticles are in-situ generated on Ni foam (NF) by a facile one-step hydrothermal approach. The NF-supported Ni3S2/Co3S4/FeOOH can serve as an efficient binder-free bifunctional electrode for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in alkaline medium. The overpotentials at current density of 10 mA cm(-2) are 158 and 181 mV for HER and OER, respectively. Moreover, the electrode exhibits remarkable performance for overall water splitting, requiring only a low voltage of 1.58 V to achieve the current density of 10 mA cm(-2), and displaying a good long-term stability. The synergistic effect of different functional components and the unique hierarchical structure are responsible for the superior electrocatalytic performances of Ni3S2/Co3S4/FeOOH compared to Ni3S2, Ni3S2/Co3S4 and Ni3S2/FeOOH.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			0927-7757	1873-4359		WOS:000711442400005

Albeit dynamic self-reconstruction of the catalysts during OER is extensively observed, it is still highly challenging to operando probe the reconstruction and precisely identify the true catalytically active components. Here, a new class of OER precatalyst, cobalt oxychloride (Co-2(OH)(3)Cl) with unique features that allow a gradual phase reconstruction during OER due to the etching of lattice anion is demonstrated. The reconstruction continuously boosts OER activities. The reconstruction-derived component delivers remarkable performance in both alkaline and neutral electrolytes. Operando synchrotron radiation-based X-ray spectroscopic characterization together with density functional theory calculations discloses that the etching of lattice Cl- serves as the key to trigger the reconstruction and the boosted catalytic performance roots in the atomic-level coordinatively unsaturated sites (CUS). This work establishes fundamental understanding on the OER mechanism associated with self-reconstruction of heterogeneous catalysts.									127	8	0	0	12	0	128			0935-9648	1521-4095		WOS:000459798700005	30633404

However, for pure carbon materials, it is difficult to obtain excellent electrocatalytic properties due to the inert potential of surface atoms and the lack of active centers in electrochemical reactions. Heteroatom-doping, which changes the charge and spin density of the carbon atoms around the doped atoms and thus increases the number of active sites, is regarded as an appealing way to enhance the electrocatalytic performances. Herein, a novel bifunctional Fe-Cu-N co-doped carbon catalyst was prepared through a facile hydrothermal-annealing strategy for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in alkaline solution. As demonstrated experimentally, high temperature induced nitrogen to transfer from decomposed g-C3N4 to carbon spheres, breaking inert atmosphere of graphite carbon surface and enlarging active surface area. Through regulating the ratio of Fe and Cu, as-prepared samples exhibited an enhanced water splitting capability. Electrochemical tests revealed that the catalyst with Fe-Cu co-doped enhanced electron conductivity and enlarged electrochemical active surface area (ESCA). As a result, a favorable catalytic water splitting performance was observed in Fe-Cu@CN3: overpotentials of 91 mV at 10 mA/cm(2) and 362 mV at 10 mA/cm(2) for catalyzing the HER and OER, respectively. This work gives a novel strategy for the design and fabrication of bifunctional carbon-based electrocatalysts.									10	0	0	0	0	0	10			0022-4596	1095-726X		WOS:000647792400029

Herein, we firstly introduced the selectively Se-doped Co3O4@CeO2 nanoparticle-dotted nanoneedle arrays through three continuous operations of mild hydrothermal, air calcination and selective selenation. The remarkable HER and OER performance of SCCN-1 resulted from abundant oxygen vacancy as well the heterostructure and was testified by the overpotentials at a certain current density: 48 mV@10 mA cm(-2) and 175 mV@50 mA cm(-2) for HER; 188 mV@20 mA cm(-2) and 293 mV@50 mA cm(-2) for OER. In addition, the SCCN-1//SCCN-1 electrode couple only required a small cell voltage of 1.49 V to deliver a current density of 10 mA cm(-2), which outperformed most recently reported bifunctional catalyst and exhibited outstanding stability in 1.0 M KOH over 12 h for overall water splitting process. Density functional theory calculations show that Se-doped Co3O4 exhibits stronger water adsorption energy compared to CeO2, which proves that Se-doped Co3O4 is a true reactive center. It's worth noting that this selective Se doping strategy is versatile to improve the HER activity of transition metal oxides and further use for catalyzing water splitting process.									33	0	0	0	0	0	33			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000697562800005

Herein, we synthesized a vanadium oxide (VO2) nanostructure as a novel binder-free and bifunctional electrocatalyst for a rechargeable aqueous sodium-air (Na-air) battery. VO2 nanostructures were grown on reduced graphene oxide coated on carbon paper, which had a carambola morphology. We confirmed the bifunctional nature of VO2 nanostructures by analyzing their electrocatalytic activity associated with the oxygen reduction reaction and oxygen evolution reaction. The reaction pathway associated with electrocatalytic activity was also affirmed by computational modeling and simulation studies. Thereafter, an aqueous Na-air cell was built using novel binder-free VO2 nanostructures as the air electrode. The fabricated cell displayed a 0.64 V overpotential gap, 104 mW g(-1) power density at 80 mA g(-1) current density, 81% round trip efficiency and good cyclic stability up to 50 cycles.									105	0	0	0	2	0	105			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000395074300027

In this study, an in situ one-step hydrothermal method was developed to prepare the oxygen-containing groups-modified g-C3N4 (OG/gC(3)N(4)) by a facile and green hydrothermal treatment of bulk g-C3N4 in pure water without any additives. It was found that the hydrothermal treatment (180 degrees C) not only could greatly increase the specific surface area (from 2.3 to 69.8 m(2) g(-1)), but also caused the formation of oxygen-containing groups (-OH and C=O) on the OG/g-C3N4 surface, via the interlayer delamination and intralayer depolymerization of bulk g-C3N4. Photocatalytic experimental results indicated that after hydrothermal treatment, the resultant OG/g-C3N4 samples showed an obviously improved H-2-evolution performance. Especially, when the hydrothermal time was 6 h, the resultant OG/g-C3N4(6 h) exhibited the highest photocatalytic activity, which was clearly higher than that of the bulk g-C3N4 by a factor of ca. 7. In addition to the higher specific surface area, the enhanced H-2-evolution rate of OG/g-C3N4 photocatalysts can be mainly attributed to the formation of oxygen-containing groups, which possibly works as the effective H-2-evolution active sites. Considering the facie and green synthesis method, the present work may provide a new insight for the development of highly efficient photocatalytic materials. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Previous studies showed that the large overpotential of alpha-Fe2O3 for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) resulted from the sequential transfer of electrons and protons. Here, by combining alpha-Fe2O3 with La2O3, which functions as a solid proton acceptor, concerted proton electron transfer (CPET) was induced. The induction of CPET facilitated the formation of intermediate species, leading to the OER activity enhancement at neutral pH. This work may provide useful insight for the design of promising OER catalysts, which is pivotal for energy conversion.									18	0	0	0	1	0	18			2155-5435			WOS:000489204000041

Herein, three-dimensional (3D) mushroom-like NiCo/NiCo2S4@NiCo arrays grown directly on Ni foam (NF) have been constructed via hydrothermal and electrodeposition methods. Owing to the unique mushroom-like structure and the beneficial effect of the composite catalyst, the NiCo/NiCo2S4@NiCo/NF electrode exhibits excellent activity and stability for both OER and HER. When serving as an anode electrocatalyst, the composite catalyst only requires a overpotential of 294 mV to achieve a high current density of 100 mA/cm(2) for the OER in 1M KOH. Moreover, in chronopotentiometric and chronoamperometric measurements, the NiCo/NiCo2S4@NiCo/NF electrode displays distinguished electrochemical and structural stability for at least 100,000 s. Similarly, the NiCo/NiCo2S4@NiCo/NF catalyst delivers a hydrogen production current density of 10 mA/cm(2) at an overpotential of 132 mV and shows no obvious attenuation of performance after stability testing for 100,000 s in an extreme alkaline environment. Accordingly, the remarkable and stable bifunctional abilities enable the application of the NiCo/NiCo2S4@NiCo/NF catalyst in two-electrode water-alkali electrolyzers with a low cell voltage of 1.55 V to deliver a current density of 10 mA/cm(2) and excellent stability for over 27 h.

Herein, we designed a novel hollow CeOx/CoP heterostructure supported on nickel foam (NF) through two-dimensional Co-metal-organic framework (Co-MOF) as template, which could be used in electrocatalytic water splitting The hollow CeOx/CoP/NF nanocatalyst demonstrated excellent activities toward oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in anode and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in cathode with relatively low overpotential (264 mV and 117 mV) at 10 mA cm(-2). Besides, the battery potential was only 1.63 V toward electrocatalytic water-splitting at 10 mA cm(-2), and demonstrated excellent operational durability for 60 h. In this work, introducing CeOx significantly enhanced the inherent activity of monophase transition-metal phosphides (TMPs). Thus, this work may provide a new standpoint for constructing heterostructures with high activity containing transition-metal compounds and rare earth species for electrocatalytic water splitting.									31	0	0	0	1	0	31			2199-692X			WOS:000533371300001

Herein, we report a novel strategy to produce 3D ultrasmall zero-valent iron-coupled nickel sulfides nanosheets (Fe-0-NixSy) hybrid on self-supported conductive Ni foam (denoted as Fe-0-NixSy/NF) through a robust single-step gas-solid reaction. In this 3D hybrid, the Fe-0-NixSy nanosheets with a length of approximately 400 nm and an average thickness of 33 nm are uniformly grown on the Ni foam. Benefiting from the unique 3D hierarchical structure and synergistic effect between Fe(0)and NixSy, the 3D Fe-0-NixSy/NF hybrid shows an excellent electrocatalytic activity towards oxygen evolution reaction (OER) at extremely high current densities in basic media. The current densities of 1000 and 1500 mA cm(-2 )are achieved at low potentials of 1.57 and 1.60 V, respectively, thus meeting the expected OER standards for industrial applications. These overpotentials of the 3D Fe-0-NixSy/NF hybrid are the lowest among all previously reported nickel-sulfide-based electrocatalysts, and are even superior compared to state-of-the-art Ir/C catalysts. We further demonstrate that the integration of the 3D Fe-0-NixSy/NF electrocatalyst as both anode and cathode with a silicon photovoltaic cell enables highly active and sustainable solar-driven overall water splitting.									35	4	0	0	1	0	35			2196-0216			WOS:000461673300007		
J	Yun, Tae Gyu; Heo, Yoon; Bae, Hyung Bin; Chung, Sung-Yoon					Yun, Tae Gyu/0000-0002-6335-2893			Elucidating intrinsic contribution of d-orbital states to oxygen evolution electrocatalysis in oxides								NATURE COMMUNICATIONS				12	1					824	10.1038/s41467-021-21055-0				FEB 5 2021	2021	Although numerous studies on oxide catalysts for an efficient oxygen evolution reaction have been carried out to compare their catalytic performance and suggest new compositions, two significant constraints have been overlooked. One is the difference in electronic conduction behavior between catalysts (metallic versus insulating) and the other is the strong crystallographic surface orientation dependence of the catalysis in a crystal. Consequently, unless a comprehensive comparison of the oxygen-evolution catalytic activity between samples is made on a crystallographically identical surface with sufficient electron conduction, misleading interpretations on the catalytic performance and mechanism may be unavoidable. To overcome these limitations, we utilize both metallic (001) LaNiO3 epitaxial thin films together with metal dopants and semiconducting (001) LaCoO3 epitaxial thin films supported with a conductive interlayer. We identify that Fe, Cr, and Al are beneficial to enhance the catalysis in LaNiO3 although their perovskite counterparts, LaFeO3, LaCrO3, and LaAlO3, with a large bandgap are inactive. Furthermore, semiconducting LaCoO3 is found to have more than one order higher activity than metallic LaNiO3, in contrast to previous reports. Showing the importance of facilitating electron conduction, our work highlights the impact of the near-Fermi-level d-orbital states on the oxygen-evolution catalysis performance in perovskite oxides. Despite many studies on the oxygen-evolution perovskite-type electrocatalysts thus far, significant constraints prevent precise evaluations of catalytic activity. Here authors examine over 50 heteroepitaxial LaNiO3 and LaCoO3 (001) thin films to assess the intrinsic catalytic behaviors.									29	0	0	0	3	0	29				2041-1723		WOS:000617499600026	33547273

Herein, we demonstrate ultrathin heterogeneous nanosheets as a promising OER electrocatalyst, which are composed of ultrafine CoFeOx nanoparticles and a monolayered CoN4-based metal-organic framework (MOF) matrix. The embedding of such inorganic nanoparticles in the MOF lattice creates metal Co sites located at the CoFeOx/MOF interfaces. Structural characterization and analysis indicated a higher valence and changed 3d electronic configuration for the interfacial Co in contrast to the CoN4 sites. Furthermore, theoretical calculations reveal the high activity of interfacial Co sites for OER. Electrochemical studies confirm that the ultrathin heterogeneous nanosheets deposited on carbon cloth can achieve an excellent electrocatalytic OER performance with a low overpotential of 232 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) with good stability. This work provides insights on the development of ultrathin OER heterocatalysts with highly active interfaces of inorganic units and MOFs.									68	5	0	0	0	0	69			1936-0851	1936-086X		WOS:000518024700065	31999429

Herein, we introduce Ni ions to obtain spherical Prussian blue analog (PBA) doped with Co/Fe/Ni and further to synthesize nitrogen and Co/Fe/Ni co-doped carbon nanotubes (denoted as CoFeNi-CNTs) with small diameters (20-30 nm) by pyrolyzing the mixture of melamine and PBA. The optimized CoFeNi-CNTs have abundant metal-nitrogen-carbon (M-N-C) structures and CoFeNi nanoparticles respectively as effective ORR and OER active sites, which lead to outstanding electrocatalytic activities and durability with a half-wave potential of 0.85 V for ORR and an overpotential of 440 mV for OER. Especially, the rechargeable Zn-air battery based on CoFeNi-CNTs catalyst delivers a high peak power density of 138.7 mW cm(-2), specific capacity of 793 mAh g(Zn)(-1) and stable charge-discharge cycling over 500 h, outperforming the Pt/C-RuO2 based devices. And all-solid-state Zn-air battery also displays excellent discharge-charge performance and stability.

Here, self-supported monolithic hybrid electrodes that are composed of bimetallic cobalt-molybdenum nitride nanosheets vertically aligned on 3D and bicontinuous nanoporous gold (NP Au/CoMoNx) are reported as highly efficient electrocatalysts to boost the sluggish reaction kinetics of water oxidation in alkaline media. By virtue of the constituent CoMoNx nanosheets having large accessible CoMoOx surface with remarkably enhanced electrocatalytic activity and the nanoporous Au skeleton facilitating electron transfer and mass transport, the NP Au/CoMoNx electrode exhibits superior OER electrocatalysis in 1 m KOH, with low onset overpotential (166 mV) and Tafel slope (46 mV dec(-1)). It only takes a low overpotential of 370 mV to reach ultrahigh current density of 1156 mA cm(-2), approximate to 140-fold higher than free CoMoNx nanosheets. The electrocatalytic performance makes it an attractive candidate as the OER catalyst in the water electrolysis.									66	7	0	0	6	0	68			0935-9648	1521-4095		WOS:000510055000001	31999014

The synergy between Fe and Ni atoms is crucial in modulating the electronic structure of the active site to enhance electrochemical performance. Herein, a simple chemical immersion technique was used to grow Ni-Fe oxalate nanowires directly on a porous nickel foam substrate. The as-prepared Ni-Fe oxalate electrode exhibited an excellent electrochemical performance of the OER with ultralow overpotentials of 210 and 230 mV to reach 50 and 100 mA cm(-2) current densities, respectively, in a 1 M KOH aqueous solution. The excellent OER performance of this Ni-Fe oxalate electrode can be attributed to its bimetallic composition and nanowire structure, which leads to an efficient ionic diffusion, high electronic conductivity, and fast electron transfer. The overall analysis indicates a suitable approach for designing electrocatalysts applicable in energy conversion.									20	0	0	0	0	0	20			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000718271300076	34699178

Particularly, the rational structural design of electrocatalysts with high-density and well-exposed active sites is critically important to reach high catalytic activity. In this work, we have grown Co9S8 nanowires on carbon fiber paper via a hydrothermal route, and notably the Co9S8 nanowires are encapsulated in an unusual fluffy shell layer constructed using a continuous N,S-codoped carbon coating decorated with copious, vertically grown, short N,S-codoped carbon nanotube material. Such a nanowire/nanofluff combined structure provides not only many voids for rapid mass transfer, but also numerous specific surfaces for the loading of active sites, and it can be used well as a bifunctional catalyst in both oxygen evolution and hydrogen evolution reactions. Particularly, the obtained catalysts exhibit good oxygen evolution activity, showing a small overpotential of 290 mV to obtain a geometric current density of 10 mA cm(-2) in 1.0 M KOH electrolyte. Besides, the closely coated carbon layers also successfully prevent the Co9S8 nanowires from dissolution and recrystallization, thus leading favorably to good durability. Indeed, the reported fluffy carbon shell offers a novel structure design, with distinct advantages regarding the exposure of and access to high-density active sites, which can be extended to a variety of functional nanomaterials.									17	5	0	0	6	0	18			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000443117300027

Herein, hybrid nanostructured arrays (HNA) with branched and aligned structures constructed by cobalt selenide (CoSe2) nanotube arrays vertically oriented on carbon cloth with CoNi layered double hydroxide (CoSe2@CoNi LDH HNA) are synthesized by a hydrothermal-selenization-hybridization strategy. The branched and hollow structure, as well as the heterointerface between CoSe2 and CoNi LDH guarantee structural stability and sufficient exposure of the surface active sites. More importantly, the strong interaction at the interface can effectively modulate the electronic structure of hybrids through the charge transfer and then improves the reaction kinetics. The resulting branched CoSe2@CoNi LDH HNA as trifunctional catalyst exhibits enhanced electrocatalytic performance toward oxygen evolution/reduction and hydrogen evolution reaction. Consequently, the branched CoSe2@CoNi LDH HNA exhibits low overpotential of 1.58 V at 10 mA cm(-2) for water splitting and superior cycling stability (70 h) for rechargeable flexible Zn-air battery. Theoretical calculations reveal that the construction of heterostructure can effectively lower the reaction barrier as well as improve electrical conductivity, consequently favoring the enhanced electrochemical performance. This work concerning engineering heterostructure and topography-performance relationship can provide new guidance for the development of multifunctional electrocatalysts.									14	0	0	0	2	0	14				2198-3844		WOS:000741349400001	35018738

AbstractIn past decades, Ni-based catalytic materials and electrodes have been intensively explored as low-cost hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalysts for water splitting. With increasing demands for Ni worldwide, simplifying the fabrication process, increasing Ni recycling, and reducing waste are tangible sustainability goals. Here, binder-free, heteroatom-free, and recyclable Ni-based bifunctional catalytic electrodes were fabricated via a one-step quick electrodeposition method. Typically, active Ni nanodot (NiND) clusters are electrodeposited on Ni foam (NF) in Ni(NO3)(2) acetonitrile solution. After drying in air, NiO/NiND composites are obtained, leading to a binder-free and heteroatom-free NiO/NiNDs@NF catalytic electrode. The electrode shows high efficiency and long-term stability for catalyzing hydrogen and oxygen evolution reactions at low overpotentials ((10)(HER)=119mV and (50)(OER)=360mV) and can promote water catalysis at 1.70V@10mAcm(-2). More importantly, the recovery of raw materials (NF and Ni(NO3)(2)) is quite easy because of the solubility of NiO/NiNDs composites in acid solution for recycling the electrodes. Additionally, a large-sized (S similar to 70cm(2)) NiO/NiNDs@NF catalytic electrode with high durability has also been constructed. This method provides a simple and fast technology to construct high-performance, low-cost, and environmentally friendly Ni-based bifunctional electrocatalytic electrodes for water splitting.									10	0	0	0	0	0	10			2311-6706	2150-5551		WOS:000468200900001	34137989

The surface microstructure was characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and the electrocatalysis of the oxygen evolution behavior was investigated using anodic polarization curves and cyclic voltammetry curves in a synthetic zinc electrowinning electrolyte of 50 g.L-1 Zn2+ and 150 g.L-1 of H2SO4 at 40 degrees C. The results show that applying the Ti/Al/Ti rod substrate can clearly decrease the grain size of the PbO2 electrodes, and the surface of electrodes become more compact. Compared with the titanium substrate electrode, applying the Ti/Al/Ti rod substrate can obviously increase the exchange current density j(0) of the PbO2-WC composite electrode during the process of oxygen evolution, reduce the apparent activation energy E-a of the oxygen evolution reaction, increase the values of electric double layer capacitance C-dl during the charging process, and improve the electrocatalytic stability. Employing the Ti/Al/Ti rod as the substrate of a composite electrode can effectively improve the electrode coating microstructure, increase the electrocatalytic activity of the oxygen evolution reaction in the electrolytic zinc liquid and exert positive effects on the application of the new substrate composite electrode.									2	1	0	0	0	0	3			1452-3981			WOS:000436257800026

Here, we report a novel sonochemical approach to synthesize amorphous nickel-iron oxides/carbon nanohybrids with tunable compositions for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The sonochemically synthesized amorphous electrocatalysts with optimal composition exhibit a low overpotential of 290 mV at 10 mA.cm(-2) and a Tafel slope of 31 mV.decade(-1) in a 0.1 M KOH electrolyte, outperforming the benchmark RuO2 catalyst. Meanwhile, these nanohybrids are also highly stable and remain amorphous even after prolonged cycling. In addition to amorphism, sonochemistry endows as-prepared nickel-iron oxides/carbon nanohybrids with a simultaneously formed carbon scaffold and internal Ni(0), which can enhance the stability and activity for the OER. This work demonstrates that sonochemistry is a unique method for synthesizing amorphous metal oxides toward an efficient and durable OER.									32	1	0	0	2	0	32			1998-0124	1998-0000		WOS:000413100400002

The diversity and flexibility of metal oxides offer numerous degrees of freedom for enhancing catalytic activity by tailoring their physicochemical properties, but the active site of current metal oxides for OER is still limited to either metal ions or lattice oxygen. Here, a new complex oxide with unique hexagonal structure consisting of one honeycomb-like network, Ba4Sr4(Co0.8Fe0.2)(4)O-15 (hex-BSCF), is reported, demonstrating ultrahigh OER activity because both the tetrahedral Co ions and the octahedral oxygen ions on the surface are active, as confirmed by combined X-ray absorption spectroscopy analysis and theoretical calculations. The bulk hex-BSCF material synthesized by the facile and scalable sol-gel method achieves 10 mA cm(-2) at a low overpotential of only 340 mV (and small Tafel slope of 47 mV dec(-1)) in 0.1 m KOH, surpassing most metal oxides ever reported for OER, while maintaining excellent durability. This study opens up a new avenue to dramatically enhancing catalytic activity of metal oxides for other applications through rational design of structures with multiple active sites.									139	7	0	0	10	0	141			0935-9648	1521-4095		WOS:000496457200001	31713899

Cobalt oxido catalyst (Co-OECs) films deposited from buffered Co-II solutions have emerged as arguably the most studied class of heterogeneous oxygen evolution catalysts. The interest in these materials stems from their formation by self-assembly, their self-healing properties, and their promising catalytic activity under a variety of conditions. The structure and function of these catalysts are reviewed here together with studies of molecular Co-O cluster compounds, which have proven invaluable in elucidating the chemistry of the Co-OECs.									47	0	0	0	11	0	47			0340-1022	1436-5049	978-3-319-23099-3; 978-3-319-23098-6	WOS:000363875500008	26245626

As a promising energy storage and conversion device, zinc-air batteries (ZABs) have the advantages of high theoretical specific energy density, low cost, and environmental friendliness. Nevertheless, the efficiency of ZABs is closely related to the electrocatalytic capacity of the air electrode due to its sluggish kinetics for oxygen reduction and evolution reaction (ORR/OER). Therefore, it is necessary to develop efficient catalysts to promote the reaction rate. Recently, cobalt-based materials have become a research hotspot for oxygen electrocatalysts owing to their rich natural content, high catalytic activity, and stability. In this review, the mechanisms of the OER/ORR reaction process, the catalyst's performance characterization, and the various combination methods with the current collector are systematically introduced and analyzed. Further, a broad overview of cobalt-based materials used as electrocatalysts for ZABs is presented, including cobalt-based perovskite, cobalt-nitrogen-carbon (Co-N-C) materials, cobalt oxides, cobalt-containing composite oxides, and cobalt sulfides/phosphides. Finally, various strategies for developing efficient electrocatalysts for ZABs are summarized, highlighting the challenges and future perspectives in designing novel catalysts.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			1998-0124	1998-0000		WOS:000776216900010

However, the Zn element is inevitably remained in the prepared Fe-N-C catalyst. Whether the residual Zn element affects the catalytic activity and active site center of the Fe-N-C catalyst caused widespread curiosity, but has not been studied yet. Herein, we built several Fe, Zn, and N co-doped graphene models to investigate the effect of Zn atoms on the electrocatalytic performance of Fe-N-C catalysts by using density functional theory method. The calculation results show that all the calculated Fe-Zn-N-x structures are thermodynamically stable due to the negative formation energies and relative stabilities. The active sites around Fe and Zn atoms in the structure of Fe-Zn-N-6(III) show the lowest oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) overpotentials of 0.38 and 0.43 V, respectively. The bridge site of Fe-Zn in Fe-Zn-N-5 shows the lowest eta(HER) of -0.26 V. A few structures with a better activity than that of FeN4 or ZnN4 are attributed to the synergistic effects between Fe and Zn atoms. The calculated ORR reaction pathways on Fe-Zn-N-6(III) show that H2O is the final product and the ORR mechanism on the catalyst would be a four-electron process, and the existence of Zn element in the Fe-N-C catalysts plays a key role in reducing the ORR activation energy barrier. The results are helpful for the deep understand of high-performance Fe-N-C catalysts.									27	0	0	0	0	0	27			1998-0124	1998-0000		WOS:000587091800004

Deposition of oxygen evolution cocatalysts on photo anodes can improve the oxygen evolution rate, but still it has some limits in some cases. In this work, we propose a new and simple precipitation approach to transform the surface of hematite into iron phosphate (Fe-Pi). Further, Ar-plasma treatment on Fe-Pi/Fe2O3 introduces oxygen vacancies on the phosphorous and photoanode. A surface phosphate treatment accelerates the transfer of holes from the bulk to the surface. Besides, creating oxygen vacancy defects on Fe-Pi/Fe2O3 can significantly increase the reactivity of active sites, leading to the remarkable enhancement in oxygen evolution reaction activity and PEC performance. The resulting photoanode has a current density of 2.71 mA cm(-2) at 1.23 V-RHE and 3.5 mA cm(-2) at 1.50 V-RHE under simulated solar light condition. The reduced surface recombination by Fe-Pi layer and Ar-plasma treatment is confirmed by electrochemical analysis. These findings give a great potential of the use of a combination strategy for cocatalyst deposition and optimizing the performance of hematite.									45	1	0	0	3	0	45			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000473251100023	31244023

The design of this porous air electrode can facilitate rapid gas and electrolyte diffusion, as well as form a continuous electronic conductive network throughout the whole energy conversion process. Because of a combination of abundant lattice strain and the oxygen vacancy effect caused by substitution of an element with a different valence state in Ni sites, LaNi0.9Cu0.1O3 exhibits a significant oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER), showing improvement in both aqueous and non-aqueous systems compared with pure LaNiO3 and LaNi0.9Co0.1O3. Especially with the redox mediator additive tetrathiafulvalene (TTF) in the electrolyte, this LaNi0.9Cu0.1O3 perovskite oxide nanosheet catalyst grown on 3D microporous nickel foam exhibits excellent bifunctional catalytic activities in the lithium-oxygen battery, showing the same highly active catalytic kinetics and high round-trip efficiency as those of reported precious metal catalysts. The overpotential remains at 0.72 V, and the round-trip efficiency is up to 80% under a current density of 0.1 mA cm(-2), with capacity limited to 1000 mA h g(-1).									35	1	0	0	1	0	35			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000397605300007

The aerogel is prepared by "DL-Mercaptosuccinic acid accelerated" sol-gel method, which is different from the well-established "nanoparticle condensation" and "metathesis" methods in terms of precursors and reaction mechanism. The fundamental of such method relies on the dual functionality of DL-Mercaptosuccinic acid, which not only initiated the sol-gel transition, but also offered sulfur source for metal sulfide. The complex interactions between the functional groups (COOH, -SH etc.) in DL-Mercaptosuccinic acid and the metal ions yield robust gel networks. After supercritical drying in ethanol, well crystallized monolithic NiCo2S4 and NiCo2S4-reduced graphene oxide aerogel can be obtained. High specific capacitance of 1268 F/g at 1 A/g and high energy density of 13.4 Wh/kg at the power density of 0.75 kW/kg can be achieved when the aerogel is used as supercapacitor electrode. The low onset overpotential of 250 mV and small Tafel slope of 70 mV/dec also confirmed the aerogel is good catalyst for electrochemical oxygen evolution reaction.									81	2	0	0	5	0	81			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000414155500022

Herein, a novel oxygen vacancy-rich 2D porous In-doped CoO/CoP heterostructure (In-CoO/CoP FNS) is designed and developed by a facile free radicals-induced strategy as an effective bifunctional electrocatalyst for rechargeable Zn-air batteries. The electron spin resonance and X-ray absorption near edge spectroscopy provide clear evidence that abundant oxygen vacancies are formed in the interface of In-CoO/CoP FNS. Owing to abundant oxygen vacancies, porous heterostructure, and multiple components, In-CoO/CoP FNS exhibits excellent oxygen reduction reaction activity with a positive half-wave potential of 0.81 V and superior oxygen evolution reaction activity with a low overpotential of 365 mV at 10 mA cm(-2). Moreover, a home-made Zn-air battery with In-CoO/CoP FNS as an air cathode delivers a large power density of 139.4 mW cm(-2), a high energy density of 938 Wh kg(Zn)(-1), and can be steadily cycled over 130 h at 10 mA cm(-2), demonstrating great application potential in rechargeable metal-air batteries.									116	2	0	0	12	0	116			1613-6810	1613-6829		WOS:000487826500001	31559688

Here we demonstrate the in situ interfacial engineering for constructing efficient OER catalysts based on the electrochemical dual-anion etching of natural arsenopyrite. The OER catalyst (FeAsS) prepared from natural arsenopyrite via an environment-friendly ball milling approach achieves a current density of 10 mA cm-2 at an overpotential of 200 mV, outperforming many state-of-the-art catalysts. The in-depth study indicates that the co-etching of lattice As and S under the OER conditions triggers the in situ surface self-reconstruction, and a self-optimized catalytic active and stable FeAsS/ alpha-FeOOH interface has been developed. Computational studies further confirm that the strong electronic coupling effect between alpha-FeOOH and FeAsS significantly tunes the binding energy between reaction intermediates and active sites, finally leading to an enhanced OER activity. The dual-anion etching of precatalysts induced in situ interfacial engineering demonstrated here expands the way of exploring other multiple nonmetallic elements involved nanomaterials as efficient OER precatalysts. This study also stimulates further study on the eco-design of electroactive materials for advanced energy conversion/storage applications from earth abundance natural resources.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000772860300005

Here, we propose that the electrocatalytic properties could be well modified by incorporating missing linkers into the MOF. Theoretical calculations suggest the electronic structure of MOFs can be tuned by introducing missing linkers, which improves oxygen evolution reaction (OER) performance of the MOF. Inspired by these aspects, we introduced various missing linkers into a layered-pillared MOF Co-2(OH)(2)(C8H4O4) (termed as CoBDC) to prepare missing-linker MOFs. Transmission electron microscope and synchrotron X-ray measurements confirmed that the missing linkers in the MOF could be introduced and well controlled by our strategy. The self-supported MOF nanoarrays with missing linkers of carboxyferrocene exhibit excellent OER performance with ultralow overpotential of 241 mV at 100 mA cm(-2). This work opens a new prospect to develop efficient MOF-based electro-catalysts by introducing missing linkers.									241	13	0	0	14	0	242			2041-1723			WOS:000494635900009	31695122

Therefore, in this work, an immensely effective photocatalyst TiO2/Ga2O3@MIL-125(Ti) has been developed via incorporation of TiO2/Ga2O3 nanocomposite into MIL-125(Ti) by using refluxed method. Powdered XRD, SEM and UV-VIS spectroscopy methods are used for the accurate characterization of synthesized samples. These techniques reveal that all the synthesized materials have been successfully formed. It also shows that heterojunctions have been successfully developed via incorporation of pre-synthesized materials into host MOF. All the synthesized samples are used to study photodegradation efficiency of methylene blue and photoelectrochemical oxygen evolution reaction via water splitting. It has been observed that TiO2/Ga2O3@MIL-125(Ti) has been emerged as highly effective catalyst toward photodegradation of methylene blue as well as oxygen evolution reaction. This high efficiency is due to collaborative effect and heterojunction formation of TiO2/Ga2O3 nanocomposites with central metallic cluster of MIL-125(Ti), which increases the charge separation, reduces the electron-hole pair recombination and enhances the absorption of visible light. TiO2/Ga2O3@MIL-125(Ti) has been photodegraded methylene blue upto 40.29% and delivers 100 mAcm(-2) at just 318 mV overpotential.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2470-1556	2470-1564		WOS:000676036400001

Thermodynamically, the overall water splitting reaction is an uphill reaction involving a multiple electron transfer process. The oxygen evolution reaction (OER) has been identified as the bottleneck process. Hematite (alpha-Fe2O3) is one of the best photoanode material candidates due to its band gap properties and stability in aqueous solution. However, the reported efficiencies of hematite are notoriously lower than the theoretically predicted value mainly due to poor charge transfer and separation ability, short hole diffusion length as well as slow water oxidation kinetics. In this Review Article, several emerging surface modification strategies to reduce the oxygen evolution overpotential and thus to enhance the water oxidation reaction kinetics will be presented. These strategies include co-catalysts loading, photoabsorption enhancing (surface plasmonic metal and rare earth metal decoration), surface passivation layer deposition, surface chemical etching and surface doping. These methods are found to reduce charge recombination happening at surface trapping states, promote charge separation and diffusion, and accelerate water oxidation kinetics. The detailed surface modification methods, surface layer materials, the photoelectrochemical (PEC) performances including photocurrent and onset potential shift as well as the related proposed mechanisms will be reviewed.									19	0	0	0	0	0	19			2073-4344			WOS:000451150200013

Carbon-based nanomaterials such as carbon nanotubes have attracted significant applications for use as substrates for anchoring metal-based nanoparticles. We show that, upon mild surface oxidation, hydrothermal annealing and electrochemical activation, multiwall carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) themselves are effective water oxidation catalysts, which can initiate the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) at overpotentials of 0.3 V in alkaline media. Oxygen-containing functional groups such as ketonic C=O generated on the outer wall of MWCNTs are found to play crucial roles in catalyzing OER by altering the electronic structures of the adjacent carbon atoms and facilitates the adsorption of OER intermediates. The well-preserved microscopic structures and highly conductive inner walls of MWCNTs enable efficient transport of the electrons generated during OER.									399	17	0	0	19	0	401			0002-7863			WOS:000350614700023	25658670

The structure of the novel compound Mn(NP(2)AH)(2) was determined from PXRD data. MnNP3 as well as Mn(NP(2)AH)(2) exhibits a chain-like structure. In both cases, the manganese atom is coordinated by six oxygen atoms in a distorted octahedron. The local coordination around Mn was further characterized by extended X-ray absorption fine structure. The synthesis process was followed in situ by synchrotron X-ray diffraction revealing a three-step reaction mechanism. The as-prepared manganese(II) phosphonates were calcined on air. All samples were successfully tested for their suitability as catalyst material in the oxygen evolution reaction.									7	0	0	0	0	0	7			0022-2461	1573-4803		WOS:000440047900007

Results found that both the release of CO and CO2 could be divided into rapid release stage and stable chemical looping reaction stage with activation energies of 17.69 and 45.65 kJ/mol, respectively. During the chemical looping process, the reaction reactivity of biochar reduced gradually with the amorphous char structure turning into fused ring structure and finally into graphite crystal structure. Simultaneously, Fe2O3 was reduced into Fe3O4, FeO and Fe. This work highlighted the chemical conversion of biochar using natural iron ore as oxygen carrier in inert N-2 atmosphere from the common in-situ gasification chemical looping process using CO2/H2O as agent.									14	0	0	0	5	0	14			0960-8524	1873-2976		WOS:000456405000007	30576914

Here, a 3D nanoporous graphene (np-graphene) doped with both N and Ni single atoms/clusters is reported. The predoping of N by chemical vapor deposition (CVD) dramatically increases the Ni doping amount and stability. The resulting N and Ni codoped np-graphene has excellent electrocatalytic activities for both the ORR and the OER in alkaline aqueous solutions. The synergetic effects of N and Ni dopants are revealed by density functional theory calculations.

J	Kosmachevskaya, O., V; Topunov, A. F.								Nonenzymatic Reactions in Metabolism: Their Role in Evolution and Adaptation								APPLIED BIOCHEMISTRY AND MICROBIOLOGY				57	5			543	555		10.1134/S0003683821050100				SEP 2021	2021	Metabolism can be represented as a network of enzymatic and nonenzymatic (spontaneous) biochemical reactions. One of the most important parts of nonenzymatic metabolism are the processes involving the formation and redox transformations of highly reactive compounds: reactive forms of oxygen, nitrogen, sulfur, halogens, and reactive carbonyl compounds. All of these reactive forms have one common property-spontaneous interaction with protein amino acid residues. The reactive forms (or reactive metabolites) have long been studied in terms of their ability to have toxic effects on cells. Later, the direction of research shifted to the study of their signaling and regulatory properties. It became clear that low concentrations of these reactive compounds were necessary for living systems. They can regulate the growth and development of the organism. On the one hand, they ensure the stability of biological macromolecules and living systems; on the other hand, they promote phenotypic variability by unmasking latent variability. The review discusses the role of these compounds as regulators of metabolic plasticity and evolutionary ability.									1	0	0	0	1	0	1			0003-6838	1608-3024		WOS:000698949600001

Here, we synthesized chlorine-doped Co(OH)(2) in situ grown on carbon cloth (Cl-doped Co(OH)(2)) as an integrated electrode by a facial electrodeposition method. The anodic potential was then applied to the Cl-doped Co(OH)(2) in an alkaline solution to remove chlorine atoms (electro-oxidation (EO)/Cl-doped Co(OH)(2)), which can further enhance the electrocatalytic activity without any thermal treatment. EO/Cl-doped Co(OH)(2) exhibits a better performance both for ORR and OER in terms of activity and durability because of the formation of a defective structure with a larger electrochemically active surface area after the electro-chemical oxidation. This approach provides a new idea for introducing defects and developing active electrocatalyst.									55	2	0	0	4	0	55			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000422814400086	29240400

By virtue of the structural feature, synergistic effects among metals, and the in situ formed active species, the as prepared phosphides with optimized composition present enhanced electrocatalytic performance toward the oxygen evolution reaction in alkaline solution. In detail, the catalyst with optimized composition reaches a current density of 10 mA/cm(2) at a potential of 1.511 V vs a reversible hydrogen electrode, which is much lower than that of a commercial RuO2 catalyst.

The two different dimensions (1D and 3D) of Zn0.2Ni0.8Co2O4 were explored in the photochemical water oxidation reaction. The 3D highly porous microspheres (MPS) were catalytically more active compared to the mesoporous 1D rods (MPR). The MPS form shows high turnover numbers than that of the MPR under similar experimental conditions. After each oxidation reaction, both the catalysts MPR and MPS (1D and 3D) were characterized and it was proved that the compounds were stable after the catalytic cycle. Further, it was found that the catalysts could be reused and recycled for several catalytic cycles. Hence, these simple catalysts Zn0.2Ni0.8Co2O4 (1D and 3D) could be proposed for application in artificial photosynthesis, as they work efficiently in the light-driven water oxidation process. Zn-Ni-Co oxide was explored for the first time as a catalyst in the water oxidation reaction.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			2398-4902			WOS:000467218700012

The X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) and X-ray photoelectron spectrum (XPS) measurements confirmed the surface lattice oxygen created on the N-CuCoS1.97 NWs during OER. Then, the density function theory (DFT) results evident that lattice oxygen constructed surface of N-CuCoS1.97 NWs has more favorable OER energetic profiles and absorption for reaction intermediate. More importantly, the flexible and wearable Zn-air battery fabricated by the N-CuCoS1.97 NWs shows excellent rechargeable and mechanical stability, which can be used in portable mobile device.

The Pd nanoparticles decorated on the walls of the PNCNFs as a bifunctional catalyst play a key role in the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), as evidenced by the electrochemical results in aqueous solution. With the synergistic effects from the PNCNF matrix with a highly conductive porous structure and the Pd nanoparticles with high electrocatalytic performance, a Li-O-2 cell containing the Pd/PNCNF composite catalyst with 25 wt% Pd nanoparticles showed notably improved electrocatalytic performance compared to a cell containing its pure PNCNF counterpart, with higher capacities, lower overpotentials, and better cycling stability. Therefore, the Pd/PNCNF composite is proposed as a potential cathode catalyst for Li-O-2 batteries.									61	2	0	0	2	0	61			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000395072800016

This study reports an advanced bifunctional hybrid electrocatalyst for both ORR and OER, which is composed of tungsten disulphide (WS2) and carbon nanotube (CNT) connected via tungsten carbide (WC) bonding. WS2 sheets on the surface of CNTs provide catalytic active sites for electrocatalytic activity while the CNTs act as conduction channels and provide a large surface area. Moreover, the newly formed WC crystalline structure provides an easy path for electron transfer by spin coupling and helps to solve stability issues to enable excellent electrocatalytic activity. In addition, it is found that four to five layers of WS2 sheets on the surface of CNTs produce excellent catalytic activity toward both ORR and OER, which is comparable to noble metals (Pt, RuO2, etc.). These findings show the many advantages enabled by designing highly active, durable, and cost-effective ORR and OER electrocatalysts.									77	1	0	0	1	0	78			1614-6832	1614-6840		WOS:000405839400005

However, the well-established catalysts for water oxidation up to now are mainly effective in strongly alkaline solutions, thus hindering the practical application in total water splitting. Under this circumstance, herein, we put forward a novel oxygen-evolving electrocatalyst based on zirconium trisulfide (ZrS3) ultrathin nanosheets for the first time, achieving efficient water oxidation behavior in both alkaline and neutral solutions. With the merits of the abundant disulfide bonds on the surface of the ZrS3 ultrathin nanosheets, the OER performance exhibits great enhancement against the bulk material. An ultralow onset overpotential of 244 mV and a small Tafel slope of 45 mV decade(-1) are achieved for the ZrS3 ultrathin nanosheets in strongly alkaline solution (pH = 14), while superior OER activity with low onset overpotential and small Tafel slope is also realized in weakly alkaline solutions and even under neutral conditions (pH = 6.9), suggesting the excellent water oxidation performance and showing broad applicable potential for total water splitting. The exploration of this novel catalyst will not only pave a new pathway in searching for advanced catalysts with high efficiency, but also offer an effective strategy in designing functional structures for other electrocatalysts.									44	1	1	0	0	0	46			2052-1553			WOS:000364543300005

A highly efficient bifunctional electrocatalyst is herein developed via the unique self-templated conversion of a guanosine-based supramolecular hydrogel and presents a fully integrated design strategy to successfully fabricate an omnidirectionally stretchable and extremely environment-adaptable Zn-air battery (ZAB) through the synergistic engineering of active materials and device architecture. The electrocatalyst demonstrates a very low reversible overpotential of only 0.68 V for oxygen reduction/evolution reactions (ORR/OER). This ZAB exhibits superior omnidirectional stretchability with a full-cell areal strain of >1000% and excellent durability, withstanding more than 10 000 stretching cycles. Promisingly, without any additional pre-treatment, the ZAB exhibits outstanding ultra-low temperature tolerance (down to -60 degrees C) and superior waterproofness, withstanding continuous water rinsing (>5 h) and immersion (>3 h). The present work offers a promising strategy for the design of omnidirectionally stretchable and high-performance energy storage devices for future on-skin wearable applications.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3				2198-3844		WOS:000791451200001	35522020

All of these are largely determined by interfacial reactions on oxygen electrocatalysts in the air electrode. In this article, we review the fundamental understanding of oxygen electrocatalysis in nonaqueous electrolytes and the status and challenges of oxygen electrocatalysts and provide a perspective on new electrocatalysts design and development.									406	28	0	0	14	0	425			2155-5435			WOS:000303492400018

The electrical parameters of the oxide electrode solution interface were obtained by fitting the experimental impedance data to the R-Omega(R(1)Q(1))Q(dl) or R-Omega(R(1)Q(1))(R(ct)Q(dl)) equivalent circuits, depending on the potential. The ohmic resistance values, R-Omega, situated between 0.6 and 1.3 Omega cm(2), obtained from EIS are consistent with that obtained from the Tafel plots. The impedance spectrum in the cyclic voltammetry region (0.4-1.4 V) is all almost vertical line at the low frequency region, indicating the interfacial impedance is purely capacitive. The (R(1)Q(1)) combination is related to the film processes observed in the high frequency domain of the impedance spectra, independent of the potential and composition. The Q(dl) describes the double layer capacitance, C-dl, of the oxide-solution interface, which is seen to increase significantly with CeO2 introduction, as a result of the electrode electrochemical active surface area increase. The intloduction of CeO2 in the IrO2/TiO2 binary system results in a decrease of the R-ct values with respect to the oxygen evolution reaction, which is probably related to the active surface area increase of CeO2-containing anodes.									4	0	0	0	0	1	4			0137-5083			WOS:000085681400013

In situ analysis using a channel flow double electrode showed anodic dissolution during the OER and cathodic dissolution from the reduction of Pt oxide. Pt dissolution during the OER showed transient dissolution behavior. Initiation of the OER triggered anodic Pt4+ dissolution; however, the dissolution was strongly inhibited by the development of oxides. Reduction of oxides formed in the OER region required lower potential than those formed below 1.5 V. The lower reduction potential increased the reduction rate of oxides and enhanced the instantaneous dissolution rate of Pt2+.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			1345-9678	1347-5320		WOS:000362157600011

In this work, we develop a heuristic approach that combines thermodynamic adsorption energetics calculated through density functional theory with microkinetic modeling using the steady state approximation to interpret the potential-dependent Tafel behavior of consecutive electrochemical reactions. In doing so, we introduce a kinetic framework for ab initio calculations that ensures self-consistent adsorption energetics based on kinetically limited adsorbate coverages. The approach is applied to experimental results on CoOx(OH)(2-x) single crystal electrocatalyst particles yielding coverage dependent mechanistic information and identification of the rate-limiting step with standard rate constants for the oxygen evolution reaction on the (112 & x304;0) surfaces of the beta-Co(OH)(2), beta-CoOOH, and CoO2 bulk phases. This generalizable method enables catalyst benchmarking based on determining the active species involved and associated intrinsic reaction rate constants in consecutive multi-electron-transfer reactions.									36	0	0	0	2	0	36			1754-5692	1754-5706		WOS:000517122800017

The results indicate that cyclization propagation was inhibited in the initial few minutes due to radical adsorption by the oxygen in the atmosphere, and then the cyclization was promoted with dehydrogenation going by oxidation, whereas the oxidation reaction was always promoted with the cyclization structure. Resultantly, a high oxygen content atmosphere didn't result in a low cyclization degree and excessive oxidation in stabilized fibers, while a low oxygen content atmosphere introduced a skin-core structure because of insufficient oxygen diffusion and rapid oxidation rate in the later stage. Finally, according to the tensile strength of carbon fibers, the optimum oxygen content in the thermal stabilization atmosphere was determined to be 15-21%.									27	3	0	0	1	0	28			2046-2069			WOS:000381490100060

Herein, a series of Mg(Co1-xFex)(2)O-4 (x = 0.0-1.0) oxides are designed as OER catalysts. MgCo2O4 is selected to fix Co3+ in the octahedral position, which is active site for the OER. We elucidate the volcanic relationship between the OER activity and Fe substitution concentration in Mg(Co1-xFex)(2)O-4, which shows an optimal activity at 20 at% Fe substitution. Superconducting Quantum Design (SQUID) technique reveals that Fe substitution tunes the e(g) orbital electronic configuration of Co3+ from low spin to high spin. The optimized e(g )occupancy of 0.91 is obtained in MgCo1.6Fe0.4O4. Density functional theory calculations verify that the improved OER performance stems from the enhanced Co-O covalence after Fe substitution, which promotes the transfer of electrons from oxygen, thus accelerates the catalytic oxygen evolution reaction. The formation energy of O* decrease as well by Fe substitution, and the conversion of OH* into O* is identified to be the rate-determining step. This work complements the optimizing electronic configuration of cobalt cations for OER and provides favorable principles for the rational design of OER electro-catalysts.

Herein, we report a facile approach to construct a novel heterostructured electrocatalyst of MnSxO2-x/MnCo2S4. The density and structure of the active centers were fine-tuned by controlling the S-O atomic ratio on the surface of MnSxO2- x. Consequently, the optimized MnS0.10O1.90/MnCo2S4 sample had excellent oxygen evolution reaction performance, with overpotential of 367 mV @ 50 mA cm-2 in 1.0 M KOH. More impressively, in 0.2 M phosphate buffer solution, the overpotential @ 10 mA cm-2 is only 414 mV. Furthermore, as the air-cathode catalyst in neutral zinc-air batteries, MnS0.10O1.90/MnCo2S4 exhibited excellent stability with the round-trip efficiency decaying by only 3.8% at 10 mA cm-2 after 140 h. Theoretical calculations revealed that Mn-Co site has the suitable binding affinity to the oxygen-containing intermediates, neither too weak (Mn site) nor too strong (CoCo site), while MnCo2S4 endows the oxidized CoMnO active species a tensile strain that decreases the overpotential. This study opens an avenue for developing high-performance and durable heterostructure electrocatalysts toward OER, metal-air batteries in neural electrolytes and beyond.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000729805600001

At present, noble metals and metal oxides are the most widely used for electrocatalysis, but they suffer from low selectivity, poor durability, and scarcity. Because of this, metal-free carbons have become the subject of great interest as promising alternative electrocatalysts for energy conversion and storage devices, and remarkable progress has been accomplished in the advance of metal-free carbons as electrocatalysts for renewable energy technologies. Particularly interesting are 3D porous carbon architectures, which exhibit outstanding features for electrocatalysis applications, including broad range of active sites, interconnected porosity, high conductivity, and mechanical stability. This review summarizes the latest advances in 3D porous carbon structures for oxygen and hydrogen electrocatalysis. The structure-performance relationship of these materials is consequently rationalized and perspectives on creating more efficient 3D carbon electrocatalysts are suggested.									91	6	0	0	2	0	91			1614-6832	1614-6840		WOS:000499012600001

Enlightened by theoretical prediction, herein, a self-sacrificed templating approach is developed to obtain edge-enriched FeN4 sites integrated in the highly graphitic nanosheet architecture. The in situ formed Fe clusters are intentionally introduced to catalyze the growth of graphitic carbon, induce porous structure formation, and most importantly, facilitate the preferential anchoring of FeN4 to its close approximation. Due to these attributes, the as-resulted catalyst (denoted as Fe/N-G-SAC) demonstrates unprecedented catalytic activity and stability for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) by showing an impressive half-wave potential of 0.89 V for the ORR and a small overpotential of 370 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) for the OER. Moreover, the Fe/N-G-SAC cathode displays encouraging performance in a rechargeable Zn-air battery prototype with a low charge-discharge voltage gap of 0.78 V and long-term cyclability for over 240 cycles, outperforming the noble metal benchmarks.									101	7	0	0	2	0	103			0935-9648	1521-4095		WOS:000585284400001	33150623

Among different TMPs, nickel phosphide (NiP) is an important class, corresponding with metal chalcogenides. In the present study, NiP is fabricated from 3-mercaptopropionic acid on carbon cloth by a simple and facile electrodeposition (ED) technique. Electrochemical studies showed that carbon cloth-supported NiP exhibits better performance than NiCo2O4 and CoP. As an active material for SCs, the electrode exhibits a specific capacitance of 227.03 F g(-1) (136.22 mA h g(-1)) at a current density of 0.5 A g(-1). Further, the electrode exhibits excellent cycling stability of 81% of its initial value after 3000 cycles, which may be ascribed to the unique structural features as well as the synergistic effect of the nickel and phosphorus species with the support of carbon cloth. Hence, the low-cost ED synthesis process and carbon cloth-supported NiP show great potential for portable energy storage system applications.									8	0	0	0	0	0	8			1144-0546	1369-9261		WOS:000536157700006

Herein, we report a novel one-step electrochemical anodic oxidation and cathodic deposition strategy to in situ fabricate three-dimensional coral-like Ni3S2 on Ni foam (NF) for electrocatalytic overall water splitting. In a typical two-electrode cell, NF acts as both cathodic and anodic electrodes with thiourea aqueous solution as the electrolyte. The nickel ions from the anodic oxidation of NF are directly used as nickel sources to form 3D coral-like Ni3S2/NF by the cathodic deposition method simultaneously. The optimal 3D Ni3S2/NF-4 electrode shows high electrocatalytic activity for hydrogen evolution reaction and oxygen evolution reaction with low overpotentials of 89 and 242 mV, respectively, to afford 10 mA cm(-2). When the as-obtained Ni3S2/NF-4 is used as a bifunctional electrocatalyst in an electrolyzer, a low applied voltage of 1.577 V is needed to reach 10 mA cm(-2), with extremely long durability. This work focuses on the rational design of unique structures as efficient non-noble metal-based electrocatalysts, which hold great potential for practical applications in electrocatalytic water splitting.									55	4	0	0	5	0	55			1944-8244			WOS:000445439900043	30136576	
J	Gerrard, AL; Weaver, JF								Kinetics of CO oxidation on high-concentration phases of atomic oxygen on Pt(111)								JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL PHYSICS				123	22					224703	10.1063/1.2126667				DEC 8 2005	2005	Temperature-programmed reaction spectroscopy (TPRS) and direct, isothermal reaction-rate measurements were employed to investigate the oxidation of CO on Pt(111) covered with high concentrations of atomic oxygen. The TPRS results show that oxygen atoms chemisorbed on Pt(111) at coverages just above 0.25 ML (monolayers) are reactive toward coadsorbed CO, producing CO2 at about 295 K. The uptake of CO on Pt(111) is found to decrease with increasing oxygen coverage beyond 0.25 ML and becomes immeasurable at a surface temperature of 100 K when Pt(111) is partially covered with Pt oxide domains at oxygen coverages above 1.5 ML. The rate of CO oxidation measured as a function of CO beam exposure to the surface exhibits a nearly linear increase toward a maximum for initial oxygen coverages between 0.25 and 0.50 ML and constant surface temperatures between 300 and 500 K. At a fixed CO incident flux, the time required to reach the maximum reaction rate increases as the initial oxygen coverage is increased to 0.50 ML. A time lag prior to the reaction-rate maximum is also observed when Pt oxide domains are present on the surface, but the reaction rate increases more slowly with CO exposure and much longer time lags are observed, indicating that the oxide phase is less reactive toward CO than are chemisorbed oxygen atoms on Pt(111). On the partially oxidized surface, the CO exposure needed to reach the rate maximum increases significantly with increases in both the initial oxygen coverage and the surface temperature. A kinetic model is developed that reproduces the qualitative dependence of the CO oxidation rate on the atomic oxygen coverage and the surface temperature. The model assumes that CO chemisorption and reaction occur only on regions of the surface covered by chemisorbed oxygen atoms and describes the CO chemisorption probability as a decreasing function of the atomic oxygen coverage in the chemisorbed phase. The model also takes into account the migration of oxygen atoms from oxide domains to domains with chemisorbed oxygen atoms. According to the model, the reaction rate initially increases with the CO exposure because the rate of CO chemisorption is enhanced as the coverage of chemisorbed oxygen atoms decreases during reaction. Longer rate delays are predicted for the partially oxidized surface because oxygen migration from the oxide phase maintains high oxygen coverages in the coexisting chemisorbed oxygen phase that hinder CO chemisorption. It is shown that the time evolution of the CO oxidation rate is determined by the relative rates of CO chemisorption and oxygen migration, R-ad and R-m, respectively, with an increase in the relative rate of oxygen migration acting to inhibit the reaction. We find that the time lag in the reaction rate increases nearly exponentially with the initial oxygen coverage [O](i)(tot) when [O](i)(tot) exceeds a critical value, which is defined as the coverage above which R-ad/R-m is less than unity at fixed CO incident flux and surface temperature. These results demonstrate that the kinetics for CO oxidation on oxidized Pt(111) is governed by the sensitivity of CO binding and chemisorption on the atomic oxygen coverage and the distribution of surface oxygen phases.									41	0	0	0	2	0	41			0021-9606	1089-7690		WOS:000234120800034	16375491

The iridium precursor [(COD)Ir(TFB-TFEA)] (COD = 1,5-cyclooctadiene; TFB-TFEA = N-(4,4,4-Trifluorobut-1-en-3-on)-6,6,6-trifluoroethylamin) unifies both reactivity and sufficient stability through its heteroleptic constitution to offer a step-by-step elimination of ligands to provide high compositional purity in CVD deposits. The substitution of neutral COD ligands against CO groups further increased the volatility of the precursor. PECVD experiments with unambiguously characterized Ir compounds (single crystal X-ray diffraction analysis) demonstrated their suitability for an atom-efficient (high molecule-to-precursor yield) gas phase deposition of amorphous iridium oxide (IrOx) phases. Thin films of IrOx were well suited as electrocatalyst in oxygen evolution reaction so that an efficient coupled system in combination with solar cells is viable to perform water-splitting reaction without external bias.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			0942-9352			WOS:000534258100008

USE - Method for describing structural effect evolution of polyurethane material by molecular simulation technology, for use in automobile, rocket missile propulsion, transportation and basic building. ADVANTAGE - The invention provides technical support for researching the evolution and performance evolution of the structure in the reaction process of the polyurethane material, at the same time, it provides a thought for the construction of some relatively complex random models. DETAILED DESCRIPTION - The method involves constructing all-atom composition model of polyurethane polymer. The ring-opening model of monomer 3,3-bis(azidomethyl)oxetane (BAMO) and tetrahydrofuran (THF) is established. The 10-42 degree of polymerization diblock copolymer containing BAMO and THF is established as a binder material through the Build Polymers tool of Materials studios. The Forcite - greater than Geometry Optimization is performed on the polymer chain to obtain a more reasonable molecular structure. The Materials Studios is used to establish a chain extender (diethylene glycol), small molecule additives such as crosslinking agent (trimethylolethane) and curing agent (2,4-toluene diisocyanate). The Forcite - greater than Geometry Optimization is used to optimize the structure of small molecules to obtain more reasonable molecular configurations. The all-atom model of the four components is obtained. The entire cross-linking process is that the hydroxyl group reacts with the isocyanate group to form the carbamate group, so the atoms involved in the reaction need to be marked in advance, and the Perl script program can identify the reaction. The key atoms, the hydroxyl oxygen atom and the isocyanate group carbon atom in the molecule are marked as R1 and R2, which guarantees that the reaction site will not be biased. The all-atom mixed unit cell of polyurethane polymer is constructed. The four-component mixing model is established according to the ratio of the number of hydroxyl groups to the number of isocyanates of 1:1-2 to obtain a more reasonable initial mixed configuration, 5-10 amorphous unit cells are first established through the Amorphous Cell module of Materials Studios. Relaxation of the all-atom initial model of the polyurethane polymer is performed. The all-atom random cross-linking model of polyurethane polymer is constructed. The obtained equilibrium configuration is read into the Perl script calculation cycle of Materials Studios. The different active atoms are set within the cut-off radius may bond, that is, the reaction between R1 and R2, the cut-off radius will increase with the progress of the simulation calculation process, by identifying the pre-labeled active atoms. The program is interrupted regardless of whether the preset reactivity is reached when the cutoff distance reaches 1.35-1.8 nm, to prevents over-bonding from causing system crash and distortion, at every cutoff distance. The five relaxations is performed so that the configuration after each bond is completed is optimized. The density of the system is obtained at the corresponding temperature, and a temperature-density relationship diagram is established. The intersection of the two straight lines is obtained, by fitting two straight lines with different slopes. The glass transition temperature is obtained, for evolution analysis of the mechanical properties of material. The uniaxial stretching of models with different degrees of crosslinking is used. The elastic region slopes are calculated separately. The maximum tensile strength is analyzed by using Young's modulus, to obtain the evolution curve of material properties during the entire cross-linking process.															0						DIIDW:2022237689		
J	Du, Xiaoqiang; Su, Hui; Zhang, Xiaoshuang								3D hierarchical Co3O4@Co3S4 nanoarrays as anode and cathode materials for oxygen evolution reaction and hydrogen evolution reaction								DALTON TRANSACTIONS				47	45			16305	16312		10.1039/c8dt04073g				DEC 7 2018	2018	With the increasing energy demand and environmental pollution, hydrogen production by water splitting is one of the best ways to solve the energy shortage. Three-dimensional (3D) hierarchical Co3O4@Co3S4/NF was first synthesized directly in situ, grown on the nickel foam through a simple hydrothermal process, and the anion-exchange reaction and the Ostwald ripening mechanism were investigated by adjusting the reaction time. The oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) activities of Co3O4@Co3S4/NF-24 h were investigated, and the required overpotentials were 270 mV and 143 mV, when the current density was 100 mA cm(-2) and 20 mA cm(-2), respectively. Subsequently, the overall water splitting activity of Co3O4@Co3S4/NF-24 h was investigated; when the current density was 10 mA cm(-2), the low cell voltage was 1.53 V, which, to our knowledge, was among the smallest values reported for electro-driven water splitting so far. This high catalytic activity is attributed to the construction of the O-S interface and the increased electron transfer rate at the beginning of the reaction. Through XRD, SEM and XPS characterization, it is proven that Co3O4@Co3S4/NF-24 h is relatively stable and is expected to be an efficient and stable water splitting catalyst.									18	0	0	0	0	0	18			1477-9226	1477-9234		WOS:000451018400035	30403234

These oxides have been developed primarily as oxygen evolution electrocatalysts for proton exchange membrane (PEM) water electrolysers. The modified polyol method was used to prepare these oxides, by reducing precursors in ethylene glycol followed by thermal oxidation at 500 degrees C. The materials were characterised in 0.5 mol dm(-3) H2SO4 and PEM electrolytes by cyclic voltammetry, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, and steady state polarisation measurements. Some comparisons were made between the electrochemical properties of the oxides in the different electrolytes. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

Herein, we design a rational CO-induced phase-segregation strategy to efficient construction of core-shell structure electrocatalyst featured with IrRux core and Ir-rich shell (IrRux@Ir). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy reveals that the intensive electronic interaction between IrRux core and Ir-rich shell induces the charge transfer from Ir to IrRux, thereby increasing the oxidation state of surface Ir sites and leading to an enhanced OER activity. Simultaneously, the Ir-rich shell efficiently protects the inner Ru atoms against dissolution during the long-term electrolysis, in turn significantly improving the structural stability. The resultant IrRux@Ir catalyst exhibits a low overpotential of ca. 288 mV at a current density of 10 mAcm(-2) and desirable durability. Impressively, the membrane electrode assembly integrated with IrRux@Ir as anode maintains a steady value of approximately 1.83 +/- 0.02 V during 400 h of electrolysis at a current density of 1 A cm(-2), demonstrating that the IrRux@Ir is one of the most robust OER electrocatalyst to date. This study provides a new perspective to design high performance and robust OER electrocatalysts in PEMWE.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0378-7753	1873-2755		WOS:000782283200003

Here, we develop a two-step calcination method to prepare cobalt nanoparticles uniformly dispersed on perovskite oxide nanofibers and to tune oxygen vacancies in perovskite LaMn0.75Co0.25O3-delta nanofibers. The obtained product shows enhanced activity toward OER. In particular, the oxygen deficient LMCO-2 catalyst prepared by a two-step calcination shows excellent OER performance that is 27.5 times that of the LMO catalyst and is comparable to that of the commercial RuO2 catalyst. It also demonstates good stability because of its novel structure, abundant oxygen vacancies, and larger number of metal ions with a high oxidation state. As an air electrode for a flexible zinc-air battery, the cell with the LMCO-2 catalyst delivers a higher power density of 35 mW cm(-2) and excellent cycling stability for 70 h. Moreover, the cell exhibits excellent flexibility under different bending conditions.									58	4	0	0	4	0	60			0020-1669	1520-510X		WOS:000472241400063	31185548

Oxygen vacancies can enhance the electrical conductivity of electrocatalysts and reduce the adsorption energy of H2O molecules on surfaces, thereby significantly enhancing their electrocatalytic activity. Taking inspiration from this, we demonstrate a green and facile reduction strategy to prepare reduced Co3O4 nanosheet arrays (R-Co3O4 NSA) with large electrochemical surface area and rich in surface oxygen vacancies. Compared to pristine Co3O4 nanosheet arrays (P-Co3O4 NSA), R-Co3O4 NSA exhibits better OER performance, with a lower overpotential of 330 mV at a current density of 20 mA cm(-2) and a smaller Tafel slope of 72 mV dec(-1). Impressively, the excellent properties of R-Co3O4 NSA can rival to the state-of-the-art noble metal oxide electrocatalyst (IrO2). This strategy of defect-engineering offers a briefness and cost-effective means for the development of highly efficient OER systems. (C) 2017 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC.

The too strong adsorption of oxygen intermediates during OER, while the too weak adsorption of hydrogen intermediate during HER, however, greatly compromise its practical water splitting applications with overpotentials as high as 450 mV for OER and 420 mV for HER to achieve 10 mA cm(-2) under alkaline conditions. Herein, by rationally introducing the nanosized iridium (Ir) modifier together with optimized exposing surface toward electrolytes, an efficient Ir-modified BP electrocatalyst with much favorable adsorption energies toward catalytic intermediates possesses an outstanding pH-universal water splitting performance, surpassing the nearly all reported BP-based catalysts and the commercial noble-metal catalysts. The Ir-modified BP catalyst with the optimized exposed surfaces only requires an overall cell voltage of 1.54 and 1.57 V to achieve 10 mA cm(-2) in acidic and alkaline electrolysers, respectively. This design uncovers the potential applications of 2D BP in practical electrocatalysis fields via decreasing reaction intermediate adsorption energy barriers and promoting the interfacial electron coupling for heterostructured catalysts, and offers new insights into the surface-dependent activity enhancement mechanism.									20	1	0	0	0	0	20			0935-9648	1521-4095		WOS:000704755300001	34623715

Carbon-based materials with their excellent electro- and photochemical properties are ideal candidates as supporting substrate for constructing of metal catalyst. Here we report a palladium (less than 5 nm in average diameter) deposited Ni carbon nanotubes (CNTs) with Ni metal nanoparticles (NPs) to be around single atom to 1-2 nm on average. Mono-dispersed Pd NPs are homogeneously immobilized on both synthesized Ni and N-doped CNTs and N-doped commercial made CNTs using poly(diallyldimethyl ammonium) chloride (PDDA) as the key bonding components. Enhanced electrocatalytic activity is observed in measurements including hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and methanol oxidation reaction (MOR), with some of the samples having higher HER (under acidic condition) and OER (under basic condition) activity comparing with the commercial Pd/C (40 wt%) sample. The result provides a forward-looking strategy for fabricating efficient and low-cost catalysts. (C) 2020 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Here, an extremely simple one-step calcination route is put forward to synthesize free-standing N-doped C electrocatalyst for the OER. The incorporation of N into carbon cloth (CC) can tune the electronic structure around the C sites for enhancing the reaction active sites and electrical conductivity, and optimizing adsorption energies for intermediates. As expected, the as-prepared CC-9NH(3)-3h electrode demonstrates remarkable OER performance in alkaline medium, affording an extremely low overpotential of 298 mV (@10 mA cm(-2)) and Tafel slope of 62 mV dec(-1), which is comparable to that of a commercial RuO2 and other promising metal-based OER catalysts. Our findings provide opportunities to explore CC as a new class of self-supporting OER electrocatalyst, and to improve its performance by modulating their intrinsic structure.									10	0	0	0	0	0	10			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000663219500003

The electrochemical oxidation of the oxide ions produced by condensation reactions of silicate species is a two-electron process kinetically controlled by mass transport of O2- to the anode. The oxygen atoms generated by the oxidation rapidly dimerize to produce dissolved oxygen which is further transformed into gaseous oxygen in the saturated bulk liquid. In basic liquids, the voltammetric peak corresponding to oxygen evolution is preceded by a prewave which has been explained by the formation of chemisorbed peroxide ions via an electrochemical reaction which involves dissolved and adsorbed oxide ions.									7	0	0	0	0	0	7			0022-3093			WOS:A1995RM29400008

Although perovskite oxides are known to have high intrinsic activity, large particle sizes rendered from traditional synthesis routes limit their practical use due to low mass activity. We report the synthesis of nano-sized perovskite particles with a nominal composition of La-x(Ba0.5Sr0.5)(1-x)Co0.8Fe0.2O3-delta (BSCF), where lanthanum concentration and calcination temperature were controlled to influence oxide defect chemistry and particle growth. This approach produced bifunctional perovskite electrocatalysts similar to 50 nm in size with supreme activity and stability for both the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The electrocatalysts preferentially reduced oxygen to water (o5% peroxide yield), exhibited more than 20 times higher gravimetric activity (A g(-1)) than IrO2 in OER half-cell tests (0.1 M KOH), and surpassed the charge/discharge performance of Pt/C (20 wt%) in zinc-air full cell tests (6 M KOH). Our work provides a general strategy for designing perovskite oxides as inexpensive, stable and highly active bifunctional electrocatalysts for future electrochemical energy storage and conversion devices.									249	6	0	0	12	0	249			1754-5692	1754-5706		WOS:000367622700020

It is observed that abundant oxygen containing functional groups formed on the surface of the treated carbon cloth. The functionalized carbon cloth (FCC) exhibits a remarkable of OER activity. Specifically, it can drive a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at a fairly low overpotential of 360 mV and a correspondent small Tafel slope of 66.7 mV dec(-1). More unexpectedly, it was found that the OER activity of FCC follows the non-concerted proton-coupled electron transfer mechanism. A possible explanation was proposed that the surface carboxyl groups improve the proton-transfer kinetics, accelerating the deprotonation from -OOH to -OO* during the OER process.

Bioelectrochemistry (Amsterdam, Netherlands)				147				108217	108217		10.1016/j.bioelechem.2022.108217				2022-Oct	2022	Nanomaterials play an important role in the fields of electrocatalysis and electrochemical immunosensor. As we all know, electrocatalytic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) can generate intensive current response under alkaline and even neutral conditions, and no by-products are produced. In recent years, OER based on non-noble metal nanocatalysts has become a research focus in the field of new energy, but there are few reports on using it as an electrocatalytic immunosensor label for biomolecule detection. In this study, we successfully synthesized CoFe-(oxy)hydroxide nanosheets through transforming CoFe prussian blue analogue (CoFe PBA). Based on the excellent OER activity of CoFe-(oxy)hydroxide in neutral solution, it was used as a new electrocatalytic marker for capturing procalcitonin (PCT) secondary antibody (Ab2). Meanwhile, gold nanoparticles (Au NPs) modified glassy carbon electrode (GCE) was utilized as immunosensor platform to immobilize PCT primary antibodies (Ab1). The linear range of the immunosensor for PCT detection is 0.0005100ngmL-1, and the detection limit is 0.33pgmL-1. Furthermore, a high recovery was obtained when this proposed method was applied to analysis human serum samples. This work not only provides a new method for clinical analysis of PCT, but also extends the application of electrocatalytic OER.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0				1878-562X		MEDLINE:35930950	35930950

We present a comprehensive study on the composite effect between NiCo2S4 and sulfur-doped carbon as a bifunctional catalyst for oxygen reduction reaction and oxygen evolution reactions. Further, the high catalytic activities of NiCo2S4 modified sulfur-doped carbon composite are explored as an air cathode for rechargeable Li-O-2 batteries. The sulfur-doped carbon surface modification with NiCo2S4 improves the reversibility and capacity due to its high specific surface area, exposing of large active sites, and the formation of smaller sized toroidal Li2O2 discharge product on cathode, which can be decomposed at a lower potential compared to a pristine carbon electrode. The Li-O-2 battery constructed with the rationally designed composite air cathode delivers ultra-high discharge capacity of 14,173 mA hg(-1) at 150 mAg(-1) and superior cyclability for over 1704 h without capacity fade due to the excellent surface properties.									39	0	0	0	1	0	39			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000510526000009

Design and development of noble metal-free, active and bifunctional electrocatalysts are crucial for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Transition-metal selenides have been applied as OER catalyst alternatives to noble metal-based catalysts. Herein, we report that a Fe-doped Ni3Se2 film electrodeposited on a conductive three dimensional macro-porous Ni foam (NF) substrate behaves as a robust electrocatalyst for the OER in a strongly basic medium (1 M, KOH), showing good activity compared to its un-doped counterpart. This catalyst showed excellent performance, exhibiting a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at an overpotential of 225 mV and a low Tafel slope (35.3 mV dec(-1)), indicating an enticing prospect in the OER.									14	0	0	0	0	0	14			2398-4902			WOS:000518690900015

A ligand, 2-methylimidazolate (2MIM), in the ZIF-8 decomposes above 600 degrees C to yield active carbon/hydrocarbon radicals/vapour. With the idea of using the high catalytic activity of nickel to grow graphitic nanostructures in a CVD process from gaseous carbon feedstocks, a precursor, bimetallic ZIF-8, is synthesized by partial substitution of zinc metal centres by nickel. Such nickel centres thus act as nanocatalysts to grow graphitic nanostructures from the carbon radicals arising from the partly decomposed ligand of the framework during the carbonization step. These hybrid structures show a highly enhanced electrocatalytic activity for the water splitting oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Furthermore the catalytic activity for the oxygen reduction and hydrogen evolution reactions (ORR and HER), and gas uptake capacities for H-2 and CO2 are enhanced with respect to the increased porosity and nitrogen doping in the samples. We also show that not all the MOF-based precursors with nickel metal centres are suitable for producing nanographitic structures. Our further investigation suggests that the graphitization in the samples plays a critical role in enhancing the catalytic activities.									26	0	0	0	0	0	26			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000417063200018

Herein, distinctive branch-leaf-shaped CuNi@NiFeCu nanodendrites are successfully synthesized by a novel bionic design strategy. Importantly, this unique catalyst can display superior performance for overall water splitting, which only requires 42 mV at 10 mA cm-2 for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and 285 mV at 50 mA cm-2 for oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Further mechanism studies disclosed that Cu atoms in nanosheet edges not only act as key active sites for HER, but also draw electron in eg orbital of Fe active sites, which weakens the adsorption strength of oxygen-intermediate and accordingly enhances OER activity. Moreover, the optimized structure can prevent the agglomeration of nanosheets, provide numerous crystalline-amorphous interfaces and oxygen vacancies, which is beneficial to the enhancement of reaction kinetics. This work paved an original strategy to improve the activity of 2D materials.									16	1	0	0	0	0	16			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000702284100003

Our investigation has suggested that the nitric oxide forms neither nitrous oxide nor it is oxidized to nitrogen dioxide with the gas phase oxygen. The results acquired with the time resolution illustrated that the reaction of ammonia with lattice oxygen was practically instantaneous. The formation of labeled (N2O)-O-18, (NO)-O-18, and (H2O)-O-18 species is evident through the NH3 contact with catalyst surface lattice oxygen but not direct contact with the gas phase oxygen. This is consistent with the view that the lattice oxygen of Mn/TiO2 catalyst has direct effect on the reaction mechanism rather than gas phase oxygen. Our labeling experiments suggest that the SCR reaction rate is very small in the absence of gas phase oxygen and enhanced distinctly by the addition of excess oxygen. The cross-labeled (NN)-N-15-N-14 is the dominant form of nitrogen during the NH3 labeling studies. The increase in the SCR reaction temperature monotonically enhanced the ammonia oxidation. The evolution of (NN)-N-15-N-14, (NNO)-N-15-N-14, and (NO)-N-15 species from the labeled ammonia ((NH3)-N-15) and unlabeled nitric oxide ((NO)-N-14) revealed the occurrence of ammonia oxidation. The results obtained in these experiments were combined with oxygen exchange experiments to arrive at conclusions regarding the plausible mechanism of the SCR reaction. The oxygen exchange between nitric oxide and the catalyst lattice oxygen established in the catalytic reduction of NO reaction. The effect of oxygen on activity and selectivity is noteworthy in both SCR and ammonia oxidation reactions over Mn/TiO2. The role of ammonia oxidation has been quantified for the overall SCR reaction network at low-temperatures. The role of ammonia oxidation and surface oxygen species has been addressed to substantiate the conclusions drawn.

Here we describe how NPG acts as a catalyst for the oxygen reduction reaction in both gas phase (in fuel cells) and aqueous environments (using rotating disk electrochemistry). NPG was found to reduce oxygen via an effectively 4-four electron route comprised of a first reduction of oxygen to hydrogen peroxide, and then an unusually active further catalytic reduction of hydrogen peroxide to water.

As an electrochemical catalyst for the OER, NiO has been extensively investigated in the past. However, due to its relatively poor conductivity, improving the electrocatalytic performance of NiO-based catalysts in the OER remains a challenge. Herein, we performed density functional theory (DFT) calculations and found that native oxygen vacancies and N-dopants could narrow the band gap of NiO, improving its conductivity for charge transference during the OER process. Therefore, we simultaneously introduced oxygen vacancies and N-dopants into NiO nanosheets by N+-ion irradiation (dose of 5 x 10(15) ions per cm(2)), improving the OER electrocatalytic performance of NiO, and reducing the potential vs. a reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) of NiO from 2.32 V to 1.98 V at a current density of 100 mA cm(-2). This research provides a new strategy to enhance the OER electrocatalytic capacity of NiO nanosheets, creating a promising catalyst for water splitting in the future.									36	2	0	0	2	0	36			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000460687400043

IrO (x) was prepared by thermal decomposition of the chloride in the temperature range from 330 to 500 degrees C. Half of the electrodes were stored in air between experiments, the other half in water. The state of the electrode surface was monitored by recording voltammetric curves in a potential region prior to O-2 evolution before and after each group of experiments. O-2 evolution was studied by measuring quasistationary current-potential curves. Tafel slopes were derived using two different approaches. The reaction order with respect to OH- was also determined and found to be fractional. Results show that the reaction mechanism does not depend on either the calcination temperature or the storage conditions. However, stability appears to be higher for electrodes calcined at higher temperatures and stored in air.									60	1	0	0	1	1	60			1432-8488			WOS:000246227000010

Herein, for the first time, we developed a novel ternary intermetallic CaFe6Ge6 precatalyst, whose surface rapidly transforms into a porous ultrathin Ca-Fe-O heteroshell structure during alkaline OER through the oxidative leaching of surficial Ge. Benefiting from synergistic effects, this highly efficient OER-active material with distinct Ca-Fe-O layers has a large electrochemical surface area and more exposed active Fe sites than a Ca-free FeOx phase. Also, the presence of Ca in Ca-Fe-O is responsible for the enhanced transport and activation of hydroxyls and related OER reaction intermediate as unequivocally illustrated by a combination of quasi in-situ Raman spectroscopy and various ex-situ methods.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			1867-3880	1867-3899		WOS:000776646200001

Herein, heterometallic anchored nitrogen-doped carbon materials are fabricated derived from metallophthalocyanine based conjugated microporous polymers (CMPs) consisting of a varying coordinated environment, which hold great promise as competing electrochemical catalyst alternatives due to their intrinsic hierarchical porosity and highly homogenous distribution of catalytic sites. The synergic heterometallic arrangement within the nitrogen-doped carbon framework leads to enhanced catalytic performances in both ORR and OER processes compared with its monometallic counterparts. Benefiting from the engineering strategy and unique structure, the as-prepared heterometallic catalyst presents remarkable ORR/OER bifunctional activity along with desirable long-time durability. The strategy proposed here highlights the potential of heterometallic phthalocyanine as a building block precursor in the rational design of high-efficiency carbon-based ORR/OER bifunctional catalysts.									16	0	0	0	1	0	16			1144-0546	1369-9261		WOS:000499476200007

The (Ru,Ir,Sn)O-2/G electrode was prepared by introducing a graphene layer into the (Ru,Ir,Sn)O-2 coating via thermal decomposition. energy-dispersive spectroscopy results revealed that graphene was successfully retained in the (Ru,Ir,Sn)O-2 coating. In contrast to the (Ru,Ir,Sn)O-2 electrode, the microstructure of the (Ru,Ir,Sn)O-2/G electrode was flat, and there were fewer surface cracks. Linear sweep voltammetry showed values of the chlorine and oxygen evolution overpotentials of the prepared (Ru,Ir,Sn)O-2/G electrode of 1.076 V and 1.290 V, respectively. This indicates that the electrocatalytic activity of the (Ru,Ir,Sn)O-2/G electrode is better than that of the (Ru,Ir,Sn)O-2 electrode. Moreover, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and an accelerated service lifetime experiment were conducted to study the stability of (Ru,Ir,Sn)O-2/G electrodes. The results indicate that the resistance of the (Ru,Ir,Sn)O-2/G electrode for the oxygen evolution reaction increased and the accelerated lifetime was 3.35 times longer than that of the (Ru,Ir,Sn)O-2 electrode at 2 A/cm(2) in 0.5 mol/L H2SO4.

Herein, porous mixed spinel MnCoxO4 was loaded on the N-doped multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MnCoxO4/NCNT) through a facile one-pot hydrothermal method to work as a bi-functional oxygen electrocatalyst. Physical characterizations confirm that the MnCoxO4 nanoparticles are composed of mixed spinel-type Co2MnO4 and (Co, Mn)[Mn, Co](2)O-4 with a diameter of 5-10 nm, which are dispersed on NCNT with secondary aggregation and resultant porous structure. Electrochemical measurements show that the MnCoxO4/NCNT catalyst exhibits high ORR catalytic activity with a dominant four-electron ORR catalytic pathway, remarkable durability, excellent methanol-tolerance, as well as superior OER catalytic activity with significantly decreased overpotential of 0.479 V in alkaline media. The multiple valence states of Co and Mn ions in MnCoxO4 coupled with the enlarged specific surface area with the help of NCNT exert crucial roles for the superior catalytic performance for both ORR and OER. Such a bi-functional oxygen electrocatalyst based on mixed spinel MnCoxO4 provides a new direction for developing low-cost, highly efficient, and robust multiple valence states transition metal-based electrocatalysts for oxygen electrode.

However, the chalcogenides are oxidised during the OER process and hence limit the stability of the electrocatalyst. The synthesized materials should have a higher oxidation state corresponding to the active species in order to improve the stability. In this study, we have employed a one-step chemical bath deposition (CBD) route to synthesis bimetallic copper nickel sulfide (CuNiS) electrocatalyst. We have accomplished a superior OER electrocatalytic activity with a lower overpotential of 337 mV at 10 mA/cm(2) current density and a small Tafel slope of 43 mV/dec. Also, we have achieved an excellent HER activity with a very low overpotential of 99 mV at 10 mA/cm(2) and a Tafel slope of 63 mV/dec. The constructed electrolyzer attained a lower cell voltage of only 1.55 V to reach the current density of 10 mA/cm(2). The stability test carried at a high current density of 200 mA/cm(2) for 50 h showed less than 5% increase in Ni3+ active species at the surface ensure the stable performance nature. Thus, this work provides a promising methodology for the synthesis of bimetallic sulfides for enhanced electrocatalytic water splitting with exceptional reliability. (C) 2021 Elsevier Inc.

This study introduces grape-like iridium nanoclusters supported on boron carbide (B4C) which increase iridium utilization compared to a non-supported iridium catalyst. A simple chemical reduction method with NaBH4 as a reducing agent was used to synthesize iridium nanoclusters on B4C. TEM images indicated that grape-like iridium nanoclusters were successfully dispersed on the B4C support. The catalytic performance of Ir/B4C was better than that of a commercial catalyst. To reach a current density of 10 mA/cm(2), the overpotential of Ir/B4C was less than that of the commercial catalyst by 32 mV. Ir/B4C also has a mass activity 2.55 times higher than that of the commercial catalyst at 1.55 V. These improvements are attributed to the high electrochemical active surface area, the weak adsorption strength of oxygen, and the presence of Ir(OH)(4) on the surface. The durability of Ir/B4C is comparable to that of the commercial catalyst at 1 mA/cm(2) for 15 h and higher at 10 mA/cm(2) for 3 h. B4C may weaken the oxidative dissolution of iridium by transferring electrons even though the high electrochemical surface area of iridium in Ir/B4C may reduce its durability.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			1388-2481	1873-1902		WOS:000605594000007

Herein, inspired by the natural synthesis and the inherent properties of metal-organic coordination materials, the FeNi-tannic acid coordination crystal was in situ grown on Ni foam ((FeNi)-Tan/NF) to directly catalyze the OER. It was found that (FeNi)-Tan/NF exhibited predominant OER activity, which required a low overpotential of 208 mV to reach a current density of 50 mA.cm(-2) under a small Tafel slope of 33.5 mV.dec(-1), and it possessed robust stability. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations demonstrated that the active site change from Ni in Ni-Tan to the Fe atom in (FeNi)-Tan may provide a more favorable OER catalytic route. This application of such polyphenol coordination materials is promising for stimulating the exploration of functional metal-organic coordination materials toward applications in the energy conversion field.									22	2	0	0	1	0	22			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000471835800020	31117435

To achieve this the reaction centers should not only be embedded in a chemically stable and electronically conducting matrix, which suppresses irreversible oxidation of the transition metals, but they also have to accommodate and transfer several electrons while sustaining a favorable redox potential. This is both theoretically and chemically a significant challenge but an important step towards mass application of energy catalysts in fuel cells or for water photo-electrolysis. This contribution will specifically address the oxygen electrode, both for reduction of oxygen to water and for photo-induced oxygen evolution from water and discuss experimental progress together with efforts to reach theoretical understanding. The role of non-linear synergetic interactions towards multi-electron transfer is emphasized and relevant mechanisms discussed on the basis of model catalysts. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

The hierarchically porous structure, favorable surface area, and unique N, Fe, and S multi-doped carbon framework stem from the particular composition of sewage sludge and the NH3 atmosphere is responsible for the excellent catalytic efficiency of the as-synthesized electrocatalyst.

In this work, ramping rates that correlated with thermal gradient has been investigated to reveal the configuration evolution of the precursors. Spectra characterizations demonstrated that ramping rates affected decomposition and aromatization of precursors. Increasing ramping rates improved the percentage of doped nitrogen and defects, promoting dispersion of Co atoms in the carbonaceous matrix and increasing density of active sties. In addition, the size variation of NaCl template under different ramping rates modifies the porous structure of Co/N-C electrocatalysts, greatly increasing the percentage of macropores and micropores at rapid ramping rates. As a result, electrocatalysts obtained at 5 degrees C min(-1) exhibit comparable catalytic activity to that of Pt/C due to highly dispersed active sites and rational percentage of porosity, facilitating the sufficient reaction of oxygen along the catalysts. These results shed lights on regulating physical properties of carbonaceous electrocatalysts.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2196-0216			WOS:000804082500001

This work reports on a novel method for fabricating TiN ceramic membrane supported nitrogen-incorporating NiCo2 nanowires (NiCo2-N/TiN) as a bifunctional electrode. Owing to its unique structure, the ample reaction sites available, and the enhanced mass/ charge transport ability, the NiCo2-N/TiN electrode exhibits efficient catalytic performance both in HER and OER, with overpotentials of 131 mV at 20 mA.cm(-2) for HER and 330 mV at 20 mA.cm(-2) for OER, together with excellent stability in alkaline solution. The NiCo2-N/TiN electrode only requires a cell voltage of 1.71 V to drive the current density of 20 mA.cm(-2) for overall water splitting, which exhibits excellent stability for more than 100000 s.

Morphological, structural, UV-vis spectra, photoluminescence spectra and photoelectrochemical tests of the electrodeposited ZnO films were measured. The synthesis conditions studied were the parameters temperature and applied current density. SEM results show ZnO films with grains of hexagonal shape, which present different grain size (150-600 nm) as a function of the studied parameters. The optical properties of ZnO films show absorption in the UV-visible region with band gap energy values from 2.92 to 3.15 eV. Through a XRD analysis, we show that the electrodeposition conditions also have an effect in the intensity of (002) polar and (100) no polar planes of electrodeposited ZnO films. Additional results by photoluminescence indicate presence of oxygen vacancies in the electrodeposited ZnO films, which is a factor considered as responsible of enhance electroactivity of ZnO films for oxygen evolution reaction in visible region.

Herein, a two-dimensional (2D) ultrathin hybrid Co-NiFe layered double hydroxide (LDH) is synthesized via a facile hydrothermal method. In 1.0 M KOH electrolyte, Co-NiFe LDH exhibits remarkable activities for OER. At the current density of 10 mA cm(-2), it only needs an overpotential of 278 mV, which is ca. 50 mV and 20 mV lower than those for NiFe LDH (328 mV) and RuO2 catalysts (298 mV), respectively. In addition, Co-NiFe LDH also shows impressive long-term stability for OER. Besides the stable morphology and crystal structure, the potential is always kept at 1.50 V and shows almost no attenuation during the 20 h of durability test. Changes in the electronic structure of LDH due to introduction of Co ions, as well as the large specific surface area facilitate the mass/electron transfer and the oxygen bubbles release, and thus lead to the enhanced catalytic properties for OER. This work can be informative not only for understanding the role of physical and electronic structures on OER but also for designing high-performance non-precious metal OER electrocatalysts.

In this work, we achieved a complete conversion of ethylene glycol toward glycolic acid with accompanying evolution of hydrogen via a cascade dehydrogenation and Cannizzaro reaction in water without any external oxidant. The yield of glycolic acid can reach 81%, and the whole homogeneous catalytic system displays a long-term continuous reaction stability. Moreover, this dehydrogenative oxidation process can be applied into the one-pot conversion of biomass carbohydrates toward a-hydroxyl acid. This finding provides a closer insight into the application of catalytic dehydrogenative oxidation techniques in designing value-added products from biomass-derived compounds as well as hydrogen evolution as a byproduct.									12	0	0	0	1	0	12			2168-0485			WOS:000494894200002

When evaluated as an electrocatalyst for ORR, the hybrid shows efficient catalytic activity, high selectivity, superior durability, and strong tolerance against methanol crossover compared with the commercial Pt/C catalyst. Such good oxygen reduction reaction performance is comparable to most of the previously reported results and the synergistic effect is found to boost the catalytic performance. Moreover, the constructed hybrid exhibits an excellent ORR activity with a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at 1.59 V and an onset potential of 1.57 V, even beyond the state-of-the-art Ir/C catalyst in alkaline media. The enhancement in electrochemical performance can be attributed to the unique morphology and defect structures, high porosity, good conductive networks, and strongly interacting CoNi-NCNT and NPCN in the hybrid. These results suggest the possibility for the development of effective nanocarbon electrocatalysts to replace commercial noble metal catalysts for direct use in fuel cells and water splitting devices.									154	7	0	0	8	0	156			1613-6810	1613-6829		WOS:000365850400010	26449376

It provides an alternative, environmentally friendly route to directly synthesize nitrate from N2(g). There is to date a limited number of investigations focused on the electrochemical NOR. Herein, we present a detailed computational study on the kinetics of both the NOR and the competing oxygen evolution reaction (OER) on the TiO2(110) electrode under ambient conditions. The use of grand canonical density functional theory in combination with the linearized Poisson-Boltzmann equation allows a continuous tuning of the explicitly applied electrical potential. We find that the OER may either promote or suppress the NOR on TiO2(110) depending on reaction conditions. The detailed atomistic insights provided on the mechanisms of these competing processes make possible further developments toward a direct electrochemical NOR process.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			1948-7185			WOS:000821854100001	35759374

The inorganic hybrid performs well as an advanced bifunctional non-precious metal electrocatalyst. The hybridization of Co3O4 with the blood-derived carbon results in improved activities not only towards the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), but also in the reverse oxygen evolution reaction (OER). An improved ORR activity and a tuned four electron transfer selectivity can be assigned to a synergistic catalytic effect due the intimate contact between Co3O4 particles and the highly conductive heteroatom doped carbon support, mediated by cobalt-nitrogen or cobalt-phosphorous coordination sites. This heterojunction may facilitate the electron transfer by preventing an accumulation of electron density within the Co3O4 particles. The straight-forward and cheap synthesis of the highly active and durable electrocatalyst make it a promising candidate for a next-generation bifunctional electrocatalyst for applications such as reversible fuel cells/electrolyzers or metal air batteries.									100	8	0	0	5	0	103			1616-301X	1616-3028		WOS:000346498900011

However, despite a flurry of research activities, the mechanism on how ceria activates those hybrid catalysts is still puzzling. Herein, by controllably modifying the oxidation state of Ce in ceria, it was revealed that creating Ce(3+)species, which are redox-coupled to Ce(4+)under OER conditions, could enhance the conductivity and optimize the OH* binding, leading to greatly improved OER activity of the catalysts. More importantly, the ceria-based hybrid catalysts also exhibited excellent long-term stability even when operating at a high current density of 50 mA cm(-2)in the strong alkaline electrolyte of 6 mKOH for more than 50 h. This work unveils the underlying role of ceria in improving the activity/stability of ceria-based catalysts and opens the way to design and fabricate ceria-based electrocatalysts for water splitting.									13	0	0	0	1	0	13			1864-5631	1864-564X		WOS:000560226000001	32677728

Herein, the MOF with an extended organic linker, NiFe(dobpdc), is synthesized and investigated for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). NiFe(dobpdc) features a yarn-ball like structure assembly from 2D nanosheets subunits and high electrocatalytic activity properties. Theoretical calculations suggest the dobpdc(4-) can extract/release charges in the electrocatalytic reaction of (* -> OH*) and (OH* -> O*), respectively. This bifunctional NiFe(dobpdc) electrocatalyst significantly elevates electrocatalytic performance with a lowest overpotential of 207 mV@10 mA cm(-2) for OER and 113 mV@10 mA cm(-2) for HER, meanwhile, the ultralow overpotentials needed to achieve the high current density of 100 mA cm(-2) for OER (251 mV) and HER (170 mV). This study provides a promising strategy to design MOF electrocatalysts for electrocatalytic applications.									22	3	0	0	0	0	23			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000589418400044

In this work, through the controlled partial oxidation of Ru nanoparticles embedded in amorphous carbon, a robust Ru-RuO2 heterostructure with electronic cooperative interfaces was rationally designed and cleverly constructed. The rich heterogeneous interface between Ru and RuO2 creates a good electronic synergy and achieves high-performance OER electrocatalysis in acidic media. The best Ru-RuO2-NC heterostructure exhibits exceptionally excellent activity with an ultralow overpotential (eta(10)) of 176 mV, a high specific mass activity of 1.37 A mg(Ru)(-1) (J(m)@ 1.53 V), and an outstanding long-term durability over 80 h at 10 mA cm(-2) in acidic environment. More importantly, the Ru-RuO2-NC heterostructure can further be utilized as a bifunctional electrocatalyst to drive acidic overall water splitting with a low cell voltage of 1.55 V and steady operation for at least 40 h at 10 mA cm(2), which possesses potential for implementation in the proton exchange membrane water electrolysis.

In this study, the synthesis of IrCo nanocacti on Co(x)S(y)nanocages (ICS NCs) is demonstrated by utilizing CoO@Co(x)S(y)nanoparticles as reactive nanotemplates. In addition to the high catalytic activities with a low overpotential of 281 mV at 10 mA cm(-2)and an outstanding mass activity of 1285 mA mg(Ir)(-1)at 1.53 V, the ICS NCs endure a prolonged OER test for over 100 h, greatly outperforming other previously reported Ir-based electrocatalysts. This work suggests that the unique hetero-nanostructure of IrCo/Co(x)S(y)inducesin situS doping during electrochemical oxidation and the beneficial effect of S doping on the enhanced stability of ICS NCs for the OER.									7	0	0	0	0	0	7			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000561429100040	32785326

A beneficial improvement in the performance of Co2P toward HER and OER was discovered. For the HER at -200 mV overpotential, the turnover frequency (TOF) increases almost 6-fold from 0.26 to 1.52 electron site(Co)(-1) s(-1) when Co2P/CB has a small amount of Cr added to form Cr0.2Co1.8P/CB. Similarly, we estimate an increase from 0.205 to 0.585 electron site(Co)(-1) s(-1) for the OER at 1.6 V for the same change in composition. With 10 atom % Cr doping, the Cr0.2Co1.8P/CB catalyst needed 226 mV overpotential to produce a cathodic current density of -100 A gCo(-1) and 380 mV overpotential to produce an anodic current density of 100 Ag-Co(-1). Based on both experimental results and theoretical calculations, the activity improvement results from optimization of the electronic properties of Co2P after Cr doping.									25	0	0	0	1	0	25			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000584489800024	32975403

In this work a highly active and very stable trifunctional electrocatalyst composed of Co2P embedded in Co, N, and P multi-doped carbon has been synthesized using zeolitic imidazolate frameworks as precursors. The synergistic effects between Co2P and the multi-heteroatom-doped carbon substrates afford materials having electrocatalytic activities for HER, OER, and ORR, which are comparable-or even superior to-those of commercial RuO(2)or Pt/C catalysts. Density functional theory calculations show that Co2P has a higher density of states at the Fermi level than ConP (0 <n< 2), which promotes electron transfer and intermediates adsorption in the catalytic process. Zinc-air batteries and water splitting devices assembled using the materials as electrode electrocatalysts show good performance and outstanding stability. This work represents a breakthrough in improving the catalytic performance of non-precious metal electrocatalysts for OER, HER, and ORR, and opens new avenues for clean energy generation.									169	14	0	0	8	0	170			0935-9648	1521-4095		WOS:000552286400001	32715558

The discrete clusters were dropcasted onto glassy carbon (GC) and indium tin oxide (ITO) electrodes, and the OER activities of the resulting films were evaluated. The catalytic surfaces were analyzed by various techniques to gain insight into the structure-function relationships of the electrocatalysts' heterometallic composition. Depending on preparation conditions, the Co-Mn oxide was found to change metal composition during catalysis, while the Ni-Mn oxides maintained the NiMn3 ratio. XAS studies provided structural insights indicating that the electrocatalysts are different from the molecular precursors, but that the original NiMn3O4 cubane-like geometry was maintained in the absence of thermal treatment (2-Ni). In contrast, the thermally generated 3-Ni develops an oxide-like extended structure. Both 2-Ni and 3-Ni undergo structural changes upon electrolysis, but they do not convert into the same material. The observed structural motifs in these heterogeneous electrocatalysts are reminiscent of the biological oxygen-evolving complex in PhotosystemII, including the MMn3O4 cubane moiety. The reported studies demonstrate the use of discrete heterometallic oxide clusters as precursors for heterogeneous water oxidation catalysts of novel composition and the distinct behavior of two sets of mixed metal oxides.									14	0	0	0	5	0	14			0947-6539	1521-3765		WOS:000360829600035	26246131

Here, we design and fabricate vertically aligned cobalt molybdenum sulfide (CoMoS) nanosheets on a conductive polyaniline (PANI) nanowire on nickel foam (NF) by a one-step solvothermal synthesis. The hybrid CoMoS-PANI array demonstrates low overpotentials of 250 and 98 mV, to achieve a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) in an alkaline solution, for the oxygen and hydrogen evolution reactions, respectively. As an electrolyzer for overall water splitting, CoMoS-PANI/NF, as both the anode and the cathode, exhibits a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at a low cell voltage, 1.58 V. Furthermore, good stability for 50 h at a current density of 20 mA cm(-2) during overall splitting suggests that CoMoS-PANI can be promoted as a highly efficient and stable bifunctional catalyst. The upgraded electrocatalytic activity of CoMoS-PANI can be ascribed to its defect-rich structure, the exhibition of the PANI nanowire to effective electron transfer, and the ample of active catalytic sites provided by the synergistic effect of the hybrid structures. This work is a promising step towards the design and exploration of hybrid materials as excellent electrocatalysts for renewable energy generation. (c) 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

A superior oxygen evolution reaction (OER) efficiency with a yielded remarkable low overpotential of similar to 0.26 V and a Tafel slope of similar to 56 mV/decade is achieved for the heterostructured Fe1Ni2 nanoparticles coated by graphitic nanocarbon in a 1 mol/L KOH solution. The influencing factors for synthesizing the electrocatalysts, such as the graphitization temperature, the content of iron and the thickness of the carbon shells are also carefully investigated, and improved electrocatalytic efficiency is achieved with appropriate fabrication parameters for the hybridized catalysts. It is considered that the synergistic effect of the defects and electrochemical conductivity of the graphitic carbon shells shows great influences on the electrocatalytic activity. In addition, the detailed electrochemically active surface area and the electrochemical impedance suggest that the FexNiy hybrids coated by graphitic nanocarbon have improved the mass transport and electron transfer rate, resulting in an enhanced electrocatalytic water splitting efficiency.

Metal oxides as alternative supports for PGMs facilitate intrinsic activity and improve durability as compared to conventional carbon supports. However, the restricted mass and electron transfer at the metal/support interface need to be addressed. Herein, to strengthen the interaction at the metal/support interfaces and improve the utilization efficiency of PGM, an ultralow loading of Pd was embedded in a surface-oxygenated PdNiMnO porous film. The Mn-doping was designed to promote surface oxygenation using a facile anodization process that created sufficiently exposed interfaces between Pd and the support, strengthening the SMSI effects at the Pd/oxygenated support interface for enhancing ORR performance. Furthermore, the Ni-containing oxygenated catalyst served as both the active component for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and the functional support for stabilizing Pd, making PdNiMnO a bifunctional catalyst for zinc-air flow batteries (ZAFB). As a proof-of-concept, the ZAFB (PdNiMnO) shows a maximal power density of 211.6 mW cm(-2) and outstanding cycling stability for over 2000 h with a minimal voltage gap of 0.69 V at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2), superior to the state-of-the-art catalysts.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			1754-5692	1754-5706		WOS:000765415000001

Herein a new approach of developing atomic epitaxial in-growth in Co-Ni3N nanowires array is devised, where a nanoconfinement effect is reinforced at the interface. The Co-Ni3N heterostructure array is formed by thermal annealing NiCo2O4 precursor nanowires under an optimized condition, during which the nanowire morphology is retained. The epitaxial in-growth structure of Co-Ni3N at nanometer scale facilitates the electron transfer between the two different domains at the epitaxial interface, leading to a significant enhancement in catalytic activities for both hydrogen and oxygen evolution reactions (10 and 16 times higher in the respective turnover frequency compared to Ni3N-alone nanorods). The interface transfer effect is verified by electronic binding energy shift and density functional theory (DFT) calculations. This nanoconfinement effect occurring during in situ atomic epitaxial in-growth of the two compatible materials shows an effective pathway toward high-performance electrocatalysis and energy storages.									303	19	0	0	7	0	307			0935-9648	1521-4095		WOS:000428793600010	29436029

However, tuning their bifunctionality for oxygen redox reaction (oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER)) is still a critical issue. Herein, N, S, P co-doped graphene-like carbon nanosheets (NSP/C) were developed via a bottom-up doping strategy with NaCl as template using a new precursor of N, S co-containing copolymer of 2, 6-Diacetylpyridine (DAP, N source) and 2-aminophenyl disulfide (APD, S source), and mixed with a P source of phosphonitrilic chloride trimer (PCT). The optimized NSP/C derived from DAP/APD and PCT with the mass ratio of 1:1 presents an ultra-high surface area of 1209 m(2).g(-1), around 3.0 nm in the thickness of nanosheets, resulting in a high half-wave potential up to 0.88 V vs. RHE for ORR and a low overpotential down to 0.35 V vs. RHE at 10 mA cm(-2) for OER, as well as remarkable stability, while its overall oxygen redox activity is 0.70 V in 0.1 M KOH. And the performance was also proved by a practical rechargeable zinc-air battery with a maximum power density output of 156 mW.cm(-2), which is better than that of the same-loading commercial catalysts of Pt/C and IrO2 (mixed with a mass ratio of 1:1). The high bifunctionality is strongly relied on the energy increase of p(z)-orbitals of carbon atoms in active sites comprising the specific ratio of graphitic N, thiophenic S and graphitic P dopants obtained from the new precursor.									7	0	0	0	0	0	7			2452-2627			WOS:000670180400002

Transition metal oxides (TMO) are appealing candidates to be largely considered as electrode catalysts. However, for practical applications, there are still challenges-the intrinsic catalytic properties of TMOs should be further improved and TMOs should be synthesized by practical routes for cost-effective and scalable production of catalysts. Therefore, finding promising ways to fabricate highly active TMOs with outstanding electrochemical hydrogen evolution performance is required. Here, we present a direct and facile synthetic approach to successfully provide highly efficient MoO3-X catalysts with electrochemically active oxygen vacancies through a one-step thermal activation process on a Mo metal mesh. Variations in the oxidation states of molybdenum oxides can significantly increase the active sites of the catalysts and improve the electrochemical activity, making these oxide compounds suitable for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Compared to the bare Mo mesh and fully oxidized Mo (MoO3) electrodes, the fabricated MoO3-X electrode exhibits better electrochemical performance in terms of overpotentials and Tafel slope, as well as the electrochemical 1000 cycling stability, confirming the improved HER performance of MoO3-X. This provides new insight into the simple procedure suitable for the large-production supply.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3				2073-4344		WOS:000584134300001

The catalyst consisting of a Ni core and Au@Pd bishell was synthesized using reduced graphene oxide (rGO) as support via chemical reduction-replacement technique. For comparative analysis, the bimetallic core-shell electrocatalyst, Ni@Pd-rGO as a control was also synthesized. A test for electrochemical activity toward oxygen reduction reactions (ORRs) and oxygen evolution reactions (OERs) was then conducted in an alkaline medium. The results showed that Ni@Au@Pd-rGO exhibited a half-wave potential (0.7713 V) similar to that of Ni@Pd-rGO, which is more positive than that of commercial carbon supported platinum (Pt/C). Furthermore, a higher limited current (5.6 mA cm(-2)) compared to Pt/C and Ni@Pd-rGO was obtained for ORRs. In OERs, Ni@Au@Pd-rGO exhibited the most negative onset potential (1.5663 V), the lowest overpotential (similar to 0.52 V), and the lowest Tafel slope (0.199 V decade(-1)) among these three materials. As a result, Ni@Au@Pd-rGO was confirmed to be an effective bifunctional electrocatalyst for ORRs and OERs. The enhanced activity is attributed to the geometric and electronic effect, the synergistic action of three metals, and the relatively stable Ni@Au@Pd system. All these factors result in an overall good performance as cathode catalyst in lithium-air batteries. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

In this work, the catalytic performance of the OER and HER on transition metal doped boron nanotubes (BNTs) was investigated using density functional theory. It was found that the doped transition metal atoms determine the catalytic activity of the BNTs. Rhodium-doped BNTs exhibited excellent OER activity, while cobalt-doped BNTs displayed great catalytic activity toward the HER. Volcano relationships were found between the catalytic activity and the adsorption strength of reaction intermediates. Rhodium- and cobalt-doped BNTs exhibited great OER and HER catalytic activity due to the favorable adsorption strength of reaction intermediates. This work sheds light on the design of novel electrocatalysts for water splitting and provides helpful guidelines for the future development of advanced electrocatalysts.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0				2046-2069		WOS:000762397100001	35424632

Comparison between electrochemical strain microscopy (ESM) and structural imaging by scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) suggests that small-angle grain boundaries act as regions with enhanced electrochemical activity. The ESM activity is compared across a family of LSCO samples, demonstrating excellent agreement with macroscopic behaviors.

However, its intrinsic poor chemical activities and limited active site densities are detrimental to corresponding reactions, for example hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). In this work, MXene decorated by phosphorus-doped TiO2 (P-TiO2@Ti3C2) was successfully designed and synthesized through in-situ phosphorus-doped TiO2 growth. Enhanced electronic conduction, extended light absorption, and promoted HER reaction kinetics were achieved by synchronously tuning phosphorous doping and oxygen vacancies (OVs). Compared with traditional MXene and corresponding derived materials, P-TiO2@Ti3C2 exhibited Vis-NIR photo-enhanced electrocatalytic HER activity with a small overpotential of 97 mV (at 10 mA cm(-2)) and a low Tafel slope of 48.4 mV dec(-1), which performed more efficient than that in darkness. Moreover, the as-synthesized catalyst offered a distinct advantage of long-term stability for more than 50 h along with light irradiation. This work provides a novel strategy for constructing MXenes materials with advantageous structures for extensive photo-electrochemical applications. (C) 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

The in-depth understanding and the adjustment of dynamic reconstruction of active phases for perovskites in OER are still a daunting challenge. Here, a refined A-site management strategy is proposed for perovskite oxides, which facilitates the surface reconstruction of the B-site element based active phase to enhance the OER performance. Electrocatalyst LaNiO3 displays a dynamic reconstruction feature during OER with the growth of a self-assembled NiOOH active layer, based on the in situ electrochemical Raman technology. Precise A-site Ce doping lowers the reconstruction potential for the active phase and the dynamic structure-activity correlation is well established. Theoretical calculations demonstrate that A-site Ce substitution upshifts the O 2p level for greater structural flexibility with optimized oxygen vacancy content, thereby activating the B-site atom and promoting the active phase reconstruction. These results suggest that A-site management prompts the B-site element based active phase dynamic reconstruction via engineered X-site content as a bridge. Therefore, indicating the strong correlation of each-site component in perovskite oxides during OER and deepening the understanding of the fundamental processes of the structural transformation and further benefiting the accurate design of high-efficiency perovskite OER electrocatalysts.									72	1	0	0	3	0	71			1614-6832	1614-6840		WOS:000615804100001

Herein, we design and construct phosphorus (P)-activated similar to 1.0 nm ultrathin CoO nanosheets (devoted as Px-CoO NSs) with enriched P-O bonds and high valence state Co active sites, which is beneficial to the OER process due to the balance with Co3+ and oxygen vacancies on the reconstructed surface/interface. In addition, such an ultrathin nanosheet structure is also benefit to expose more active sites and improve the intrinsic electronic conductivity. As a result, the surface reconstructed Px-CoO NSs show superior OER activity compared with pure CoO and IrO2as benchmark. Furthermore, P1-CoO NSs demonstrate intrinsically high mass activity of 6.8 A gat an overpotential of 270 mV, large turnover frequency of 0.0024 s-1 at an overpotential of 300 mV, and strong cycling stability in 0.1 M KOH solutions. Structural analysis further reveals that, as compared with CoO, the P-substitution not only induces the surface reconstruction into active Co oxyhydroxides under OER conditions, but also enhances the reaction kinetics. Undoubtedly, this work enriches the ways to prepare high-performance transition-metal-oxide-based catalyst for practical applications. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V.

Using in situ X-ray absorption spectroscopy, we observed most of the octahedral Co2+ in trirutile CoSb2O6 oxidized to Co3+ before the OER potential. Furthermore, oxygen vacancies facilitated further oxidation from Co3+ to Co4+ by tuning OH- adsorption energy of Co and then produced extensive active sites for O-O bond formation in OER compared to spinel-type Co3O4. As a result, we obtained a much lower OER overpotential of 360 mV at 100 mA/cm(2), providing 88% of the highest H-2 energy efficiency in the AEMS by applying a cell voltage of 1.7 V.									27	0	0	0	1	0	27			2380-8195			WOS:000619803400008

Results showed that a crack existed near the fusion line in deep sea, whereas no crack occurred in shallow sea. Tafel slope and corrosion potential of welded joint was low in deep sea environment indicting there excited hydrogen evolution reactions. Cathodic polarization was controlled by both oxygen reduction and hydrogen evolution reactions in deep sea, but only oxygen reduction reactions in shallow sea. The sensitivity of the SCC of the welded joint in deep sea was higher than that in shallow sea.									9	2	0	0	0	0	10			1452-3981			WOS:000366177100047		
J	Zheng, Ruijin; Zhang, Miao; Sun, Xun; Chen, Ruiping; Sun, Xuan								Perylene-3,4,9,10-tetracarboxylic acid accelerated light-driven water oxidation on ultrathin indium oxide porous sheets								APPLIED CATALYSIS B-ENVIRONMENTAL				254				667	676		10.1016/j.apcatb.2019.05.003				OCT 5 2019	2019	Engineering the organic/inorganic nanocomposites by taking advantage of the high electrical conductivity of the inorganic semiconductors and the structure flexibility of the organic semiconductors (OSCs) provides chances to understand the structural and electronic contributions that give rise to increased activities, which is the imperious demand for methodical design of next-generation of oxygen evolution photocatalysts. Herein, perylene-3,4,9,10-tetracarboxylic acid (PTCAD) bonded porous In2O3 nanosheets, PTCAD/In2O3 NSs, were fabricated to elucidate the performance of OSCs in light harvesting and charge separation toward photo-driven oxygen evolution reaction (OER). PTCAD coupled strongly to the conduction band (CB) of In2O3 NS and type-II energy alignment was constructed between these two organic-inorganic components. Consequently, upon excitation, electrons injected smoothly from PTCAD to In2O3 NS, leaving holes behind to perform water oxidation, which results in accelerated charge separation and transportation. Associated with the large specific area, high-speed electron transmission channels, abundant oxygen vacancies and active sites provided by the In2O3 NS, the PTCAD/In2O3 composites demonstrated highly reduced band gap (BG), boosted and stable photocurrent, as well as largely reduced overpotential, suggesting promises for broadband-light-triggered OER. In addition to the synergistic effects in promoting charge separation and inhibiting electron-hole recombination, the pi-conjugated molecule, PTCAD, played a role of manipulating the lattice plane of the In2O3 nanostructure without disturbing its porous 2D structure, providing another potential approach for enhancement of catalytic activity by regulating the crystal faces. Importantly, water oxidation over PTCAD/In2O3 NSs is indeed a proton-coupled electron transfer (PCET) processes, a key process for charge separation and water oxidation, which is significantly promoted by PTCAD. Ultimately, the photo-catalytic oxygen evolution yield enhanced greatly at the presence of PTCAD, indicating that our findings may provide clues for development of organic/inorganic hybrid semi-conducting photocatalysts for solar fuels generation.									11	2	0	0	1	0	11			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000472697500067

However, control of composition, distribution, and properties is challenging. Now, a straightforward path for the synthesis of transition-metal nanoparticles engulfed in crystalline carbon is presented with excellent control over the metal composition, amount, ratio, and catalytic properties. This approach uses molten monomers that coordinate metals ions at high temperature. At high temperatures, strong coordination bonds direct the growth of carbon material with homogeneous metals distribution and with negligible losses, owing to the liquid-like reaction compared to the traditional solid-state reaction. The strength of the approach is demonstrated by the synthesis of mono, binary, and trinary transition-metal-crystalline-carbon composites with tunable and precise elemental composition as well as good electrochemical properties as oxygen evolution reaction electrocatalysts.									9	0	0	0	0	0	9			1433-7851	1521-3773		WOS:000485137300001	31389652

However, rechargeable zinc-air battery development has been hindered by the lack of a satisfactory bi-functional electrode. In this research, we report on a solution which uses electro-deposition to dope nickel into manganese on the stainless-steel mesh. The result shows the hydroxyl group on the prepared samples improving its oxygen reduction reaction and oxygen evolution reaction performance, as well as boosting the ion diffusion rate and stabilizing the zinc-air battery charge-discharge performance (overall potential gap dropped from 0.84 V to 0.82 V after 1000 cycles).

Herein, we report phosphorus-doped Co3Mo3C/Co/CNIFs (termed P-Co3Mo3C/Co/CNIFs) hybrid with unique three-dimensional network structure as efficient hydrogen evolution reaction catalyst. Note that the introduction of P can modulate electronic structure of Mo and Co centers to accelerate hydrogen evolution reaction kinetics. The P-Co3Mo3C/Co/CNIFs exhibits low onset potential of -19 mV and Tafel slope of 64 mV dec(-1) in 1 M KOH. It requires overpotential of only 81 mV to afford a current density of similar to 10 mA cm(-2) and presents long-time stability for more than 40 hat current density of similar to 10 mA cm(-2) and similar to 50 mA cm(-2). More excellently, this facilely prepared P-Co3Mo3C/Co/CNIFs catalyst reveals promising application prospect in different kinds of water splitting devices.

All the oxides prepared by this method produced the pure spinel phase. The electrochemical characterization of the catalytic films towards O-2-evolution has been made using cyclic voltammetry and ac impedance techniques. The data show that the partial replacement of Co-ion by Fe-ion in the cobalt cobaltite Co3O4 leads to electrodes with lower surface areas. on the other hand, an enhancement of the electrocatalytic activity, towards the oxygen evolution, is confirmed by the values calculated for the corrected Tafel slopes. Values ranging from 71 to 44 mV were obtained for the pure and iron containing oxides.

Herein, we fabricated Co-Ni-N-S nanocage through a simple self-catalytic process. The outstanding OER performance is based on the rich defect sites and oxygen vacancies in the amorphous phase with abundant surface area attributed to the hollow nanocage structure, and the 'ensemble effect' caused by N and S doping. The high intrinsic active surface area of Co-Ni-N-S-O was confirmed by double-layer capacitance (C-dl : 5.39 mF/cm(2)), and the 'ensemble effect' was determined through XPS and XAS analysis. The metal centers were located to a higher oxidation state, resulting the advantageous for the formation of OER intermediates (*OOH), as proved by operando XAS analysis. The Co-Ni-N-S-O catalyst provides a valuable strategy to design electrocatalysts of high efficiency and expand the applications of catalysts based on amorphous metal oxides.									8	0	0	0	1	0	8			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000711791400002

However, the regulation of catalytically active octahedral sites in spinel structure to realize high activity and good stability for OER electrocatalysis is still a great challenge. Herein, we propose a self-doping strategy to boost OER performance of spinel-type Ni3S4 enriched high valence Ni3+ as active sites. By sacrificing Ni-based metal-organic framework, the ultrathin Ni3S4 manosheets are topologically grown on conductive Ni foam substrate and realize the simultaneous Ni3+ self-doping and surface oxygen incorporation during in situ sulfidation conversion process. These compositional and structural characteristics endow it with enhanced adsorption binding strength, enabling the highly efficient OER. As a result, the Ni3S4/NF exhibits excellent activity and outstanding stability toward OER electrocatalysis in alkaline medium, which only demands an ultralow overpotential of 266 mV to deliver a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) and manifests the stable OER process for at least 75 h. Moreover, when used as an effective overall water splitting electrolyzer, the Ni3S4/NF achieves a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at only 1.638 V with good long-term stability. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Lead and its alloys have met the requirements of zinc electrowinning up to now. This is the first time that a polyoxometalate/lead composite as an earth-abundant material has been investigated for use as anode in zinc electrowinning. A polyoxometalate/lead composite showed a high electrocatalytic activity and a long-term durability during an oxygen generation reaction in harsh high-acidic conditions of electrochemical accelerated corrosion tests. It could boost oxygen evolution by decreasing the Gibbs energy barriers of intermediates and showed a 10-fold higher electrochemically active surface area and one fifth of the polarization resistance compared to pure Pb. The overpotential of a Pb anode containing 1 wt% polyoxometalate was similar to that of a commercial Pb/0.75 wt% Ag anode, which implies the potential application of polyoxometalate/lead composite anodes in the hydrometallurgical industry.

Here, it is demonstrated that through surface metal-organic framework transformation followed by acid etching, the electronic spin state of surface Co3+ ions on spinel Co3O4 can be transformed from t(2g)(6) to the high electronic spin state of t(2g)(4)e(g)(2) by expanding the surface lattice constant, which significantly enhances the overlap of the e(g) orbital of cobalt with the oxygen adsorbates, and greatly improves the intermediates adsorption and thus the oxygen evolution reaction activity. The high electronic spin rich Co3O4 electrode exhibits an anodic current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at an overpotential of 280 mV. The finding offers a rational design strategy to manipulate the electronic spin state of catalyst and the hybridization of molecular orbitals in water electrolysis.									47	2	0	0	1	0	46			2366-9608			WOS:000432035000010

Then, we annealed the CNFs in the presence of ammonia to impart them nitrogen doping (NCNFs), large surface areas, hydrophilicity and underwater oleophobicity. As a result, the NCNF networks achieved via vacuum filtration could work as oil/dye dual-functional filtration membranes for simultaneous removal of crude oil droplets, methylene blue and reactive violet K-3R from water with high flux up to 4950 L m-2 h-1, high efficiency of 99.82% and excellent recyclability. Finally, cobalt oxide (CoxOy) nanoparticles were deposited on NCNFs to prepare CoxOy/NCNF composites, which exhibited higher electrocatalytic activity (overpotential at current density of 10 mA cm-2: 290 mV) and better durability towards the oxygen evolution reaction than the state-of-the-art precious iridium oxide catalysts. This may be attributable to nitrogen doping, synergistic effect between CoxOy and NCNFs, as well as the superior structural and compositional stability of the CoxOy/NCNF composites.(c) 2022 Elsevier B.V.

Herein, we reported the preparation of N- doped porous carbon materials with a large specific surface area of over 1900 m2g 1 via thermal bubbling of glucose in the presence of cyanuric acid and ammonia chloride. When used as electrocatalysts, the porous carbon exhibited excellent bifunctional electrocatalytic activities for both, the oxygen reduction reaction ( ORR) and the oxygen evolution reaction ( OER). The potential gap ( DE= EOERj= 10- EORR1/ 2) between two reactions at the NPC- 1000 catalyst is 0.72 V, which is even lower than that of the commercial electrocatalyst ( e. g., Pt+ RuO2, 0.80 V). The good bifunctional catalytic activities render the fabrication of high- performance rechargeable Zn- air batteries. Specifically, the flexible all- solid- state Zn- air battery assembled with NPC- 1000 as the air cathode exhibited good charge- discharge stability and the voltage efficiency could be maintained about 58.6% even after cycling for 50 h. Furthermore, no obvious voltage decay was observed under various bending, showing the good mechanical flexibility.									15	1	0	0	0	0	15				2566-6223		WOS:000477087800010

Herein, a facile and scalable route is developed to prepare N, P-codoped carbon nanospheres (NPCs) with the assistance of cesium chloride (NPC-"Cs"). After treatment with hot acid solution, no trace metals are left in the electrocatalyst, as determined by inductively coupled plasma atom emission spectrometry (ICP-AES). The obtained metal-free electrocatalyst exhibits outstanding bifunctional catalytic activity for ORR and OER. The half-wave potential is 0.85 V for ORR in 0.1 M KOH, and an overpotential of 0.34 V for OER in 1 M KOH is required to reach a current density of 10 mA cm(-2).

To accelerate sluggish oxygen evolution reaction (OER) process, we fabricated an extremely efficient oxygen-evolving hybrid catalyst by incorporating low-level rhenium content and nitrogen doped carbon cloth with NiFeOH.This hybrid catalyst, associated with a modified electronic structure of NiFeOH under the influence of N-CC and Re, generates a synergistic catalytic effect that can enhance water dissociation and intermediate hydrogen atom (H*) adsorption rate. Re-NiFeOH/N-CC exhibits high hydroxyl oxidation activity (300 mV for J(300) , 320 mV for J(500)) and this in turn satisfies the commercial criteria of alkaline water electrolysis by delivering a high current density of 300 mA cm(-2) at a cell voltage of 1.88 V. The high robustness of Re-NiFeOH/N-CC catalyst in the multistep stability test (in 1 M KOH electrolyte) proves its efficacy in electricity-driven large-scale hydrogen production.									2	0	0	0	1	0	2			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000773505100002

With the advantages of the multilayered V(4)C(3)T(x)MXene that can simultaneously support the RSM reaction and keep the inner skeleton stable, a series of amorphous Ni/Fe/V-ternary oxide hydroxides thin layer can be successfully modified on the surface of the V(4)C(3)T(x)MXene (denoted as MOOH @V4C3Tx, M = Ni, Fe, and V) without disrupting its original structure. Attributed to the in situ reconstruction of highly active oxide hydroxide layer, the nanohybrids exhibited an enhanced oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity and excellent long-time stability over 70 hours. In particular, a current density of 10 mA cm(-2)can be reached by the nanohybrid with the optimized Ni/Fe ratio at an overpotential (eta) as low as 275.2 mV, which is comparable to most of the state-of-the-art OER catalysts and better than other MXene-based derivatives. Demonstrated by the tunable physicochemical properties and excellent structural stability of these nanohybrids, we may envision the promising role of the M4X3-based MXenes as substrates for a wide range of energy conversion and storage materials.									65	8	0	0	1	0	65				2567-3165		WOS:000554860300010

Here, we report a one-pot scalable pyrolysis strategy to fabricate a tri-functional electrocatalyst, i.e., hybrids with carbon coating FeCoPx nanoparticles, which shows favorable electrocatalytic properties toward oxygen reduction reaction, oxygen evolution reaction in alkaline solution, and hydrogen evolution reaction in acidic condition. The new synthesis routes enable us to readily develop an integrated device with a Zn-air battery driving an alkali-acid electrolyzer by just using one catalyst.

Bubble growth on the electrode surface can block the reaction. Here, we present the use of a magnet to remove bubbles from the catalytic sites, reducing the activation overpotential in the electrochemical reaction. The results demonstrate that the directional migration of oxygen or hydrogen bubbles during water electrolysis can be achieved by the magnetic field, uncovering the transport mechanism of gas bubbles in oriented motion induced by Lorentz force and buoyancy. Increase of magnetic strength can speed up bubble shedding especially at large currents, inhibiting dendrite growth of electrodeposited metal. Moreover, the charging threshold would be lowered at the action of isotropy of Ni magnetic domains. Removal of bubbles absorbed at the electrode using the magnet would be beneficial for energy saving, surface quality of electrodeposited metal, and hydrogen production.									8	0	0	0	0	0	8			2574-0962			WOS:000557375200081

Both active and robust OER catalysts are highly desired to boost overall water splitting. Recently, two-dimensional and self-supported transition metal oxides and (oxy)hydroxides (2D-SS-TMOs) have received particular attention due to their high intrinsic activity, large electrolyte accessible surface area, decent electrical conductivity, and great structural stability. In this review, the recent developments of 2D-SS-TMO OER catalysts are summarized. Both fabrication methods and the strategies for activity enhancement of 2D-SS-TMOs are also reviewed.

In this work, we report a three-dimension (3D) nanostructure with the Ni9S8 nanorods embedded in oxygen-incorporated MoS2 (O-MoS2) nanosheets for supercapacitors and hydrogen evolution catalysts. The in situ grown Ni9S8/O-MoS2 nanocomposite on carbon cloth can be used as a free binder supercapacitor electrode and hydrogen evolution catalyst. The Ni9S8/O-MoS2 nanocomposite exhibits electrochemical behaviors with a specific capacitance of 907 F g(-1) (at 2 A g(-1)) and good cycle stability after 1200 cycles due to its unique mutual embedding 3D nanostructure. Furthermore, the Ni9S8/O-MoS2 nanocomposite also shows highly electrocatalytic features for hydrogen production with an onset overpotential of similar to 150 mV and a low Tafel slope of similar to 81 mV dec(-1). The oxygen incorporation of MoS2 provides more active sites to participate in the catalytic process for the hydrogen evolution reaction.									39	1	0	0	0	0	39			0957-4484	1361-6528		WOS:000412843200002	28869216

Herein, a facile synthesis procedure for the development of FeCo bimetallic alloy nanoparticles (NPs) located on the tips of multi-walled carbon nanotubes (CNTs) supported over N-doped carbon nanofibers (CNFs) is presented. The CNTs, not only prevent FeCo NPs from agglomeration by encapsulating them at the tip but also provide an efficient electron pathway. The materials exhibited excellent performance in oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and decent activity in hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) with long-term durability of up to 48 hours on glassy carbon electrode. The best OER activity with a overpotential of 283 mV@10 mAcm(-2) and Tafel slope of 38 mV/dec was achieved with a hierarchically porous catalyst having Fe : Co molar ratio of 1 : 2. This synthesis approach is promising for growing well-dispersed CNTs over N-doped carbonaceous support using bimetallic alloys for electrocatalytic applications.									24	0	0	0	2	0	24			1867-3880	1867-3899		WOS:000499004900001

This study demonstrates a layered CaCo2O4 with a two-dimensional nanoplate structure, which possesses electrocatalytic activity for OER. The OER activity was achieved on CaCo2O4 with a Tafel slope of 71 mV dec(-1) and a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at an overpotential of 371 mV, which was more active than the similar structure LiCoO2 catalyst. Combined with X-ray absorption fine structure and density functional theory calculations, the enhanced OER activity and stability are mainly attributed to the unique electronic structure derived from the interaction of Ca and Co, and improved electrical conductivity. CaCo2O4 can be developed as a highly active and earth-abundant catalyst for OER in energy conversion and storage technologies.

LSPtCO with Pt in the +4 oxidation state shows the highest activity for OER in comparison to undoped La1-xSrxCoO3 (LSCO) and Pt metal-supported LSCO (Pt is in the zero oxidation state). These results indicate that a high oxidation state of Pt is favorable for the OER activity. Pt4+ is also shown as the active center for the OER reaction as its reductive treatment decreases the OER activity significantly. Thus, the formation of high-valent Pt is a key factor in fabricating an active OER catalyst. While Pt metal may not be a good catalyst for OER, Pt4+ is significantly superior, especially in LSCO.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			1932-7447	1932-7455		WOS:000731169200007

Herein, we report a facile one-step solvothermal synthesis of cobaltous dihydroxycarbonate nanowires (Co-OCH NWs) with a tunable diameter ranging from 8.7 to 16.7 nm, which were able to exhibit an interesting diameter-dependent catalytic activity towards the OER. It should be highlighted that the thinnest nanowires (8.7 nm) demonstrated the best OER catalytic activity among the as-prepared nanowires, showing an overpotential of only 307 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) and a Tafel slope of 75 mV dec(-1) in 1.0 M KOH solution. Based on comprehensive analysis, the excellent electrocatalytic activity of Co-OCH NWs was ascribed to the simultaneous achievement of an enlarged specific surface area, increased oxygen vacancy concentration and favorable position of the 3d-band center for the Co-OCH NWs with the continuous decrease of their diameters. More importantly, this work has emphasized that synergistic tuning of the oxygen vacancy concentration and d-band center position of nanomaterials via facile size control enables boosting their electrocatalytic performance substantially, thereby opening a simple route to design and prepare Earth-abundant electrocatalysts with higher efficiency and lower cost.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000540759000034	32458912

The three different morphologies are used as catalysts for hydrogen evolution (HER), oxygen reduction (ORR) and glucose oxidation reactions. The wire morphology is found to be better than that of spheres and hexagons for all the reactions. Among the reactions studied, NiSe is found to be good for HER and glucose oxidation while ORR seems to terminate at the peroxide stage.									31	1	0	0	0	0	32			1463-9076	1463-9084		WOS:000361142200017	26291172

On a Bi2MoO6@TiO(2)NTA photocathode, the conversion of benzyl alcohol to benzaldehyde is realized with the selectivity of 100 %. This is originated from enhanced adsorption and activation of benzyl alcohol on this photoanode, as confirmed from tested by in situ FTIR techniques. The electrons generated during such a controllable and selective primary oxidation reaction is then utilized as the source for synergistical hydrogen production. The amount of generated hydrogen is then 5.5 times higher than that when OER is used. The efficiency for such hydrogen production is as high as 85 %. The proposed strategy combines solar energy and biomass for the efficient production of the valuable raw material - benzaldehyde as well as green energy source - hydrogen.									24	2	0	0	0	0	25			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000621625500002

However, the preparation of electrocatalysts usually involves complex procedures, rendering investigation of the catalytic mechanism difficult. In this study, S-modified FeOOH electrocatalysts were prepared via a facile hydrothermal method at 120 degrees C. The electrocatalyst exhibited an outstanding OER performance with an overpotential of 254 mV at 50 mA.cm(-2). Morphological, structural, and electrochemical characterizations revealed that Fe ion is the most important active center.

The hydrogen evolution reaction is a competing process of the NITRR, which should be properly suppressed to achieve a high Faradaic efficiency of the NITRR. Herein, ultrathin CoOx nanosheets with abundant surface oxygen are designed as a low-cost NITRR catalyst, which delivers an ultrahigh ammonia yield of 82.4 +/- 4.8 mg h(-1) mg(cat)(-1) with a Faradaic efficiency of 93.4 +/- 3.8% at -0.3 V versus the reversible hydrogen electrode. Theoretical calculation reveals that the surface oxygen on cobalt sites can stabilize the adsorbed hydrogen on cobalt oxide, which hampers the evolution of hydrogen and leads to an enhanced NITRR activity. This work demonstrates that surface modification plays a critical role in suppressing the HER and facilitating the NITRR through a NHO pathway with a lower energy barrier.									15	0	0	0	1	0	15			2155-5435			WOS:000751835200044

The H-2, evolution profile showed that there exist two types of H-2 evolution reactions (Types I and II). Type I is water splitting by the activated form of ClO-layer (alpha), (n=repetition number) where the activated form changes to the original form (beta(n)) Type II is the H-2 evolution from water by the oxidation of ClO-layer, where the original CIO-layer form (beta(n) changes to a slightly oxidized form (beta(n+)). The measurement of the O-2 volume in the activation step (ClO-layer (beta(n))-->ClO-layer (alpha(n))+1/20(2)) showed that about 0.4-0.8 moles of the oxygen were released from the ClO-layer (beta(n)) by passing O-2-free Ar gas at 300 degrees C, when one mole of H-2 gas was evolved by the Type I reaction of the activated ClO-layer (ClO-layer (alpha)) with water at 300 degrees C.

In particular, the excellent catalytic activity of the 25 wt.% V2O5 with 75 wt.% WO3(WV-1) catalyst for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) can be attributed to the optimum concentration of V2O5, high surface area, high conductivity, and mesoporous nature, since they aid facile electrochemical activity and reduced overpotential and small Tafel values than other catalysts.

Herein, non-noble bifunctional electrocatalyst Ni0.67Co0.33(PO3)(2) nets with optimized morphology were successfully synthesized. Owing to the micropores with the accelerated electrolyte and gases transfer and nanopores architecture with more exposed active edge sites, the self-supported Ni0.67Co0.33(PO3)(2)-12 h electrode exhibits a superior water splitting performance. Impressively, the Ni0.67C o(0.33)(PO3)(2)-12 h electrode only needs a cell voltage of 1.46 V to achieve 10 mA/cm(2) and shows over 22 h stability at 10, 50 and 100 mA/cm(2), respectively. This present work suggests a unique and earth abundant material synthesis method for water electrolysis, which has broad prospects for practical water splitting application. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V.

The activity of these catalysts is known to be enhanced by the introduction of Mn3+. We present in situ electrochemical and X-ray absorption spectroscopic studies, which reveal that Mn3+ may be introduced into MnO2 by an electrochemically induced comproportionation reaction with Mn2+ and that Mn3+ persists in OER active films. Extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) spectra of the Mn3+-activated films indicate a decrease in the Mn-O coordination number, and Raman microspectroscopy reveals the presence of distorted Mn-O environments. Computational studies show that Mn3+ is kinetically trapped in tetrahedral sites and in a fully oxidized structure, consistent with the reduction of coordination number observed in EXAFS. Although in a reduced state, computation shows that Mn3+ states are stabilized relative to those of oxygen and that the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) is thus dominated by oxygen states. Furthermore, the Mn3+(T-d) induces local strain on the oxide sublattice as observed in Raman spectra and results in a reduced gap between the HOMO and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO). The confluence of a reduced HOMO-LUMO gap and oxygen-based HOMO results in the facilitation of OER on the application of anodic potentials to the delta-MnO2 polymorph incorporating Mn3+ ions.									134	5	0	0	13	0	136			0027-8424	1091-6490		WOS:000434114900005	29784802

The journal of physical chemistry letters				13	35			8336	8343		10.1021/acs.jpclett.2c01638				2022-Sep-08	2022	Understanding the chemical states of individual surface atoms and their arrangements is essential for addressing several current issues such as catalysis, energy stroage/conversion, and environmental protection. Here, we exploit a profile imaging technique to understand the correlation between surface atomic structures and the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in Mn3O4 nanoparticles. We image surface structures of Mn3O4 nanoparticles and observe surface reconstructions in the (110) and (101) planes. Mn3+ ions at the surface, which are commonly considered as the active sites in OER, disappear from the reconstructed planes, whereas Mn3+ ions are still exposed at the edges of nanoparticles. Our observations suggest that surface reconstructions can deactivate low-index surfaces of Mn oxides in OER. These structural and chemical observations are further validated by density functional theory calculations. This work shows why atomic-scale characterization of surface structures is crucial for a molecular-level understanding of a chemical reaction in oxide nanoparticles.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0				1948-7185		MEDLINE:36040956	36040956

Despite these characteristics, their efficiency to produce oxygen at high current densities is low. In this work, we report a Pb-Co-Sn film with enhanced efficiency and improved electrocatalytic properties. Pulsed cathodic electrodeposition was used to develop Pb-Co-Sn films at different deposition times among 2 and 10 min. Polarization curves were recorded to determine the deposition parameters. Morphological studies showed that the films grown for 6 min exhibited a well-covered and homogeneous surface. Structural analyses were recorded employing X-ray diffraction (XRD) and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM) that showed a nanostructured film composed by Pb and CoSn2 nanocrystallites. The electrochemical behavior of the developed Pb-Co-Sn films was measured by polarization curves in a sulfuric acid solution demonstrating a great ability to catalyze the OER: a reduction of the overpotential by 55% and 8.5% versus a Pb-Ca-Sn anode and Pb-Co film, respectively, accompanied by a strong increase in the current density. Thus, the addition of tin to the anode has a positive effect on the electrocatalytic performance of the film.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			1388-0764	1572-896X		WOS:000668173900002

In this study, a highly active oxygen evolution reaction catalyst, FeOx is successfully deposited on BiVO4 by a simple and low energy needed photochemical metal organic deposition (PMOD) process under ambient environment. During the PMOD process, metal organic precursor goes through ligand-to-metal charge transfer, triggers by UV irradiation, and then reacts with oxygen to form a thin amorphous FeOx catalyst layer. This FeOx coated BiVO4 photoanode boosts the hole injection efficiency to similar to 100% which is almost triple comparing to the bare BiVO4. Furthermore, with FeOx layer, the onset potential shifts cathodically for about 0.4 V and the photocurrent density at 1.23 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) reaches 1.1 mA/cm(2) which is 2.5 times of a bare BiVO4 photoanode. The stability of the photoanode is also improved. The FeOx coated BiVO4 demonstrates a substantial enhancement of the incident photon to current efficiency (IPCE) and the absorbed photon to current efficiency (APCE) due to its ability in increasing the hole injection efficiency and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) kinetics.

The anodic polarization curves were measured at various temperatures ranging from 30 to 80 degreesC and the activation energy for the oxygen evolution reaction was evaluated. The experimental activation energy increased linearly with increasing the overpotential. The activation energy at the equilibrium potential was linearly correlated with the difference between the crystal field stabilization energies of Mn4+ at initial state and Mn4+ at transition state. The electrocatalysis characteristics of the anode were discussed by means of the mechanism of the substitution reaction of the ligand(S(N)1 and S(N)2) and molecular orbital theory. The results show that the anode has better electrocatalystic characteristics.									2	4	0	0	1	0	5			1005-9040			WOS:000170922200010

Therefore, the reduction of Pt amount while preserving the electrocatalytic efficiency represents a viable alternative. In this work, we prepared new PtRu2 nanoparticles supported on sulphur and nitrogen co-doped crumbled graphene with trace amounts of iron (PtRu2/PF) electrocatalysts. The PtRu2/PF catalysts exhibited enhanced electrocatalytic performance and stability for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) at pH = 0. Moreover, the prepared PtRu2/PF electrocatalyst displayed higher HER activity than commercial 20% Pt/C. The PtRu2/PF catalyst achieved a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at an overpotential value of only 22 mV for HER, performing better activity than many other Pt-based electrocatalysts. Besides, the PtRu2/PF revealed a good performance for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in alkaline media. The PtRu2/PF catalyst recorded a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at an overpotential of only 270 mV for OER in KOH (1.0 M) solution and an onset potential of 0.96 V vs. RHE (at 1 mA cm(-2)) for ORR in KOH (0.1 M) solution.

In recent years, the introduction of cerium (Ce) into electrocatalysts is an effective way to improve the performance of oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Herein, we report a cerium oxide deposited nickel iron carbonate hydroxide hydrate (NiFeCH(Ce)) on the carbon fiber paper through two-step hydrothermal/electrodeposition approach. The NiFeCH(Ce) not only exhibits a remarkably improved OER performance with an overpotential of 252 mV at a current density of 100 mA cm(-2), but also possesses a small Tafel slope of 59 mV dec(-1), the both values superior to the most non-noblemetal-based OER electrocatalysts reported. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analysis shows that the super OER electrocatalysis performance of the NiFeCH(Ce) was related intensely with the introduction of Ce ions, which not only richer surface defects and higher oxygen adsorption capacity, but also provide more effective charge and mass transfer between intermediates and catalysts, making a great contribution to the OER enhancement.									11	0	0	0	0	0	11			1432-8488	1433-0768		WOS:000498102900001

The corresponding limiting yields decrease inversely with oxygen pressure in the range 2 - 8 Torr. A kinetic analysis is presented suggesting a second order process for the deactivation of O-2(a) that scales with electron number density. The pseudo first order decay rates in a microwave discharge are high, similar to 6,000 s(-1), and slower in an RF discharge, 300-500 s(-1). In both cases the decay rate is independent of oxygen pressure and flow rate. The role of vibrationally excited ground state oxygen is largely unexplored and may offers one possible mechanism. The results are consistent with a three-body atomic oxygen reaction only if the electron number density increases with oxygen pressure, in contradiction to the reported modeling results.

Herein, in situ synthesized Fe-doped CrOOH nanosheets on Ni foam (Fe-CrOOH/NF) were designed as electrocatalysts and performance in the OER was obviously improved. The effect of the amount of Fe doping was also investigated. Experiments revealed that the best performance of Fe-CrOOH/NF requires low overpotentials of 259 mV to reach 20 mA cm(-2) together with a turnover frequency of 0.245 s(-1) in 1.0 M KOH, which may suggest a new direction for the development of Fe-doped OER electrocatalysts.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0957-4484	1361-6528		WOS:000641840100001	33765662

Here, using in-situ environmental transmission electron microscopy (ETEM), we directly visualize surface atom dynamics at manganite perovskite catalyst surfaces for oxygen evolution reaction (OER), which are >= 20 times faster in water than in other ambients. Comparing (001) surfaces of La0.6Sr0.4MnO3 and Pr0.67Ca0.33MnO3 with similar initial manganese valence state and OER activity, but very different OER stability, allows us to distinguish between reversible surface adatom dynamics and irreversible surface defect chemical reactions. We observe enhanced reversible manganese adatom dynamics due to partial solvation in adsorbed water for the highly active and stable La0.6Sr0.4MnO3 system, suggesting that aspects of homogeneous catalysis must be included for understanding the OER mechanism in heterogeneous catalysis.									10	0	0	0	0	0	10				2662-4443		WOS:000610572100002

Here, Co3O4 is studied as OER catalyst and to improve the electrocatalytic activity, carbon is chosen as the conducting support. A simple and cost-effective synthetic route is developed for the synthesis of Co3O4 on carbon support following hydrothermal route using various hydrolyzing agents. The heterostructure Co3O4/C perform well in OER as a non-precious metal catalyst. The best Co3O4/C electrocatalyst can generate 10 and 30 mA/cm(2) current densities upon application of 1.623V and 1.678V vs. RHE whereas, bare Co3O4 can generate current density of 10 and 30 mA/cm(2) upon application of 1.677 and 1.754V vs. RHE. Carbon in the heterostructure helps to improve the conductivity and at the same time enhances the charge transfer ability which further leads to increase current density and stability to the catalyst. Co3O4/C can generate unaltered current density up to 1000 cycles. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.									15	0	0	0	0	0	15			0021-9797	1095-7103		WOS:000442700000030	29982018

While the ORR appears irreversible, the introduction of a tetrabutylammonium perchlorate (TBAClO(4)) co-salt in excess concentrations results in the gradual appearance of a quasi-reversible OER process. Combining the results of systematic cyclic voltammetry investigations, the degree of reversibility depends on the ion pair competition between Ca2+ and TBA(+) cations to interact with generated superoxide (O-2(-)). When TBA(+) is in larger concentrations, and large reductive overpotentials are applied, a quasi-reversible OER peak emerges with repeated cycling (characteristic of formulations without Ca2+ cations). In situ Raman microscopy and rotating ring-disc electrode (RRDE) experiments revealed more about the nature of species formed at the electrode surface and indicated the progressive evolution of a charge storage mechanism based upon trapped interfacial redox. The first electrochemical step involves generation of O-2(-), followed primarily by partial passivation of the surface by CaxOy product formation (the dominant initial reaction). Once this product matrix develops, the subsequent formation of TBA(+)--O-2(-) is contained within the CaxOy product interlayer at the electrode surface and, consequently, undergoes a facile oxidation reaction to regenerate O-2.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			2041-6520	2041-6539		WOS:000658401000001	34257892

The first kind of electrode is made of anodic iridium oxide nanoparticules (AIRONP) prepared by cycling well-defined iridium metal nanoparticles supported on carbon between O-2 and H-2 evolution potentials. The oxidation process can be followed by cyclic voltammetry and CO oxidation experiments. From TEM observation and the knowledge of the active layer loading, the active surface area of these electrodes are estimated and their activities are presented for the two reactions. For the sake of comparison, electrodes fabricated by thermal decomposition of an iridium salt (TOIROF) have been studied. Their electroactive real surface area have been determined from voltammetric charge measurements. Beforehand, a correlation factor between the real surface area measured by gas adsorption experiments and this later parameter had been established. The mechanism for the two evolution reactions and for the two different electrodes is discussed in the light of our results and literature data. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Upon the addition of pyridine to the electrolyte, the UV-vis signal of Mn3+ disappeared on beta-MnO2 while remaining on alpha-MnO2.

Herein, polypyrrole (PPy) with 3D flower-like structure has been prepared to obtain N-doped porous carbon sheets (N-C) and to implant with cobalt oxides (Co3O4) via simple and cost-effective hydrothermal reaction. Benefitting from the 3D flower-like porous carbon structure, Co3O4/N-C demonstrates enlarged surface area replenished with more electrocatalytic active sites. What's more, Co3O4 nanoparticles are evenly dispersed onto the N-doped carbon surface which effectively prevents their aggregation and detachment. These exclusive structural features render amazing catalytic activity for Co3O4/N-C towards OER with an onset potential of -1.31 V (vs RHE), low overpotential of 120 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) and a Tafel slope of only 33 mV dec(-1) in basic media. This work presents a simple approach to meet an ideal catalytic material with better morphology and advantageous properties for the possible energy and environmental applications.

Here, three kinds of superlattices from alternate restacking of any two of the three unilamellar nanosheets of MoS2, NiFe-layered double hydroxide (NiFe-LDH), and graphene are systematically investigated for electrocatalytic water splitting. The MoS2/NiFe-LDH superlattice exhibits a low overpotential of 210 and 110 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and alkaline hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), respectively, superior than MoS2/graphene and NiFe-LDH/graphene superlattices. High activity and stability toward the overall water splitting are also demonstrated on the MoS2/NiFe-LDH superlattice bifunctional electrocatalyst, outperforming the commercial Pt/C-RuO2 couple. This outstanding performance can be attributed to optimal adsorption energies of both HER and OER intermediates on the MoS2/NiFe-LDH superlattice, which originates from a strong electronic coupling effect at the heterointerfaces. These results herald the interface modulation of superlattices providing a promising approach for designing advanced electrocatalysts.									135	14	0	0	6	0	135			1530-6984	1530-6992		WOS:000475533900039	31185571

The results indicated that the subsequent stabilization reaction of PAN pretreated in air was more obvious than that in N-2. In addition, the thermal stability of PAN pretreated in air is better than that in N-2. The structural analysis by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and solid state C-13 nuclear magnetic resonance implied that oxygen promoted dehydrogenation and a compact conjugated structure was formed in PAN. In addition, the C = O structures were generated in air and increased gradually with temperature. The contents of oxygen in PAN fibers studied by elemental analysis corresponded with the structural evolution. Further investigation indicated that the C = O structures helped dehydration and also promoted formation of the cross-linked structures. A mechanism for structural evolution in PAN during stabilization in air was proposed. (c) 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J. Appl. Polym.

Therefore, exploring the synergy of various active sites is extremely significant to develop catalysts for OER with multiple elementary steps. Herein, we adopt the physically adsorbed metal ions method to successfully synthesize a highly-efficient electrocatalyst containing the dual active sites of Fe-NiOOH and NiC4 single atoms (marked as Ni SAs/Fe-NiOOH). The Ni SAs/Fe-NiOOH displays outstanding OER performance with an overpotential of 269 mV to deliver current density of 10 mA/cm(2) that shows 55 mV superior to commercial IrO2/CB at the same condition. Experiments and density functional theory calculations indicate that the excellent OER activity of Ni SAs/Fe-NiOOH catalyst is attributed to the synergy of dual active sites of NiC4 SAs and Fe-NiOOH. A tandem catalysis mechanism is also proposed to reveal the synergism of two active centers, which makes the potential-determining step more facile and accordingly decreases the OER overpotential. This work offers a new concept of tandem catalysis to develop the electrocatalysts with many elemental steps, like OER and oxygen reduction reaction catalysts.									18	1	0	0	1	0	18			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000697097800004

Recently, metal organic frames (MOFs) have become one kind of OER electrocatalysts. To obtain MOFs with high OER activity, the ternary NiFeZr MOFs were synthesized and prepared by a simple solvothermal method. The results show that the OER performance of ternary NiFeZr MOFs is better than the corresponding bimetallic NiFe MOFs due to the doping of Zr. At the optimal dosage of Zr of 0.12 mmol, the overpotential at 10 mA/cm(2) (eta(10)) of NiFeZr MOFs-0.12 on the glass carbon electrode is only 288 mV. The reasons behind were explored from the aspects of electrochemical surface area (ECSA), electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), electronic structure and zeta potential of catalysts and the OER mechanism on NiFeZr MOFs was also revealed. To further improve the OER activity, the NiFeZr MOFs-0.12 was grown in-situ on the nickel foam (NF), which exhibits an overpotential at 50 mA/cm(2) (eta(50)) of only 345 mV and good stability. This study proves that the reasonable incorporation of metal into OER active MOFs is effective to improve their OER activity. (C) 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

For first time, new evidence is provided for electroanalytical approach which consists of using chronoamperometric curves, to obtain Tafel plots at different detection times. Besides, intermediates of OER (e.g. (OH)-O-center dot) were detected and quantified indirectly by fluorescence spectroscopy. This technique detects the formation of 7-hydroxycoumarin in situ from the reaction between coumarin and (OH)-O-center dot. Among all anode materials tested, only SnO2-Sb2O5 and boron doped diamond (BDD) electrodes showed the typically Tafel slope value of 120 mV dec(-1), associated with a primary water discharge as determining step, where (OH)-O-center dot is the main active intermediate. The potential that provide the best detection of (OH)-O-center dot in several electrolytes for these two electrodes were identified. This spectroscopic studies support the evidence of the formation of (OH)-O-center dot as the rate determining step (RDS) in the OER mechanism. (C) 2016 The Electrochemical Society.

Herein, it is reported for the first time that pure and Fe2O3-containing Co3O4-based OER electrocatalysts are grown on highly porous Ni foams by plasma enhanced-chemical vapor deposition and/or radiofrequency sputtering. Thanks to the inherent advantages of cold plasma synthesis routes, Ni foam supports are efficiently infiltrated by Co3O4 nanostructures and eventually nanosized Fe2O3, allowing a fine-tuning of their mutual content, nano-organization, and oxygen defectivity. For Co3O4-Fe2O3 systems, these issues enable current densities up to approximate to 120 mA cm(-2) at 1.79 V versus the reversible hydrogen electrode, an overpotential of approximate to 350 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) and a Tafel slope as low as 60 mV dec(-1), favorably comparing with literature values for most cobalt-based OER catalysts reported so far. Such features, accompanied by a good time stability, represent an important goal for eventual practical applications and candidate the proposed fabrication route as a valuable tool for the design of efficient electrocatalysts with precisely engineered properties and based on naturally abundant transition elements.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			2196-7350			WOS:000691069300001

Single crystal X-ray crystallographic analysis revealed that the quadruply N-heterocycle-fused porphyrins 7Ni and 8Ni possess a saddle-shaped structure and the porphyrin trimer 12Zn exhibits a three-bladed propeller conformation with a central triptycene uint. The maximal absorption of these porphyrins extends close to 900 nm. Electrochemical measurements and density functional theory (DFT) calculations were performed to gain insights into the electronic structure, spectral properties, and aromaticity of these heterocycle-fused porphyrins. The singlet oxygen (O-1(2)) production and electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) behaviours of these heterocycle-fused porphyrins were also investigated in this study.									2	0	0	0	1	0	2			2052-4129			WOS:000695229300001

Herein, LaNiO3 nanorods supported on reduced graphene oxide (LNO-NR/RGO) were synthesized via a hydrothermal method, and characterized by XRD, SEM, TEM, XPS, TG and BET. The results show that the LaNiO3 nanorods have a perovskite structure and good dispersion behavior on the RGO sheets. The catalytic activity of the composite for ORR and OER has been studied by using a rotating disk electrode (RDE) technique. LNO-NR/RGO shows better oxygen electrode potential, a maximum cathodic current density of -4.26 mA cm(-2) at 1600 rpm was obtained, and the ORR mainly favors a direct four electron pathway. Compared with pure LaNiO3 nanorods and commercial Pt/C, LNO-NR/RGO is more active for OER, a lower onset potential for OER and a bigger anodic current at the same applied potential are observed. The cycle performance and the stabilities of LNO-NR/RGO toward charge/discharge are significantly higher than those of commercial Pt/C in zinc-air batteries. Such excellent catalytic activity is attributed to the synergistic effect between LNO-NR and RGO along with the 1D conduction in the composite.									36	2	0	0	0	0	37			2046-2069			WOS:000384322700083

SACs could greatly increase the availabilities of the active metal atoms in many catalytic reactions by reducing the size to single atom scale. Graphene-supported metal SACs have also drawn considerable attention due to the unique lattice structure and physicochemical properties of graphene, resulting in superior activity and selectivity for several chemical reactions. In this paper, we review recent progress in the fabrications, advanced characterization tools and advantages of graphene-supported metal SACs, focusing on their applications in catalytic reactions such as CO oxidation, the oxidation of benzene to phenol, hydrogen evolution reaction, methanol oxidation reaction, oxygen reduction reaction, hydrogenation and photoelectrocatalysis.

NiFe layered doublehydroxide (NiFe-LDH) materialss with modifiable nanostructures and tunable electronic properties have attracted considerable attention. At present, its modification strategies mainly include single structural defect, simple material composite and so on, while there are few studies involving multiple structure defect synergy. In this work, environmental-friendly hydrothermal-electrodeposition method was employed to build oxygen defects on the surface of NiFe layered double hydroxides and anchor NiCu nanoclusters with abundant, cheap nickel foam (NF) as the conductive substrate. The synergistic effect of oxygen defects and NiCu alloys resulted in a significant increase in the exposure of active sites and an enjoyable enhancement in intrinsic electrocatalytic activity. The obtained NiFe-LDH-Vo@NiCu sample exhibits outstanding OER (244 mV@50 mA cm(-2))/HER (85 mV@10 mA cm(-2)) performance in 1 M KOH solution. Furthermore, NiFe-LDH-Vo@NiCu presents ultra-low battery voltage of 1.54 V as well as remarkable stability as a bifunctional electrode. Finally, DFT calculations were applied to reveal the effects of the introduction of O vacancies and the anchoring of NiCu nanoclusters on the internal electronic structure of NiFe-LDH materials. In general, this research can provide new insights into designing of high performance NiFe-LDH electrocatalysts.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000810318700005

By integrating photothermal materials into electrocatalytic network and thus allowing solar energy to work as additional driving force, the OER is expected to be boosted. However, the rational design of such electrochemical system still remains a challenge due to the spatial inconsistency between photothermal component and electrocatalytic component. Herein, it is reported that multifunctional nickel sulfide (Ni3S2) nanosheet arrays show both photothermal and electrocatalytic properties for solar-intensified electrocatalytic system, which well eliminates the spatial inconsistency between the aforementioned two types of functional components by using one bifunctional material. The deliberate design of nanoarray architecture formed by the interconnected Ni(3)S(2)nanosheets endows larger surface area and higher surface roughness, thus enhancing light absorption by suppressing diffuse reflection and facilitating electron transfer in electrocatalytic reactions. Therefore, the OER activity is significantly improved. Under light illumination, the current density of Ni(3)S(2)nanosheets could reach 492.2 mA cm(-2)at 1.55 V, about 2.5-fold that in dark conditions, with a Tafel slope of as low as 60 dec(-1). The solar-intensified electrochemical system based on multifunctional material presents prospective potential in electrochemical water splitting for efficient hydrogen production.									18	3	0	0	3	0	20			1613-6810	1613-6829		WOS:000551430500001	32705807

In this work, we propose a novel and environmentally-friendly approach to synthesize in situ a meso-porous MnOx/S doped graphitized carbon (MnOx/S-GC) hybrid with a specific surface area of 502.6 m(2) g(-1). The synthesis involves the thermal treatment of polyvinyl chloride (PVC) together with KMnO4 and (NH4)(2)Fe(SO4)(2). It is the first time a MnOx/S-GC hybrid is fabricated directly from a carbon source without any intermediate products such as graphene oxide or additional chemical reagents. In addition, since PVC is the major component of plastics, this method has provided a new approach for the utilization of waste. Most importantly, the as-prepared hybrid showed a high catalytic activity towards both ORR and OER. The current density reached -3 mA cm(-2) at 0.81 V and 10 mA cm(-2) at 1.62 V vs. reversible hydrogen electrode respectively. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Herein, we represent a series of three-dimensional porous B and N co-doped graphene aerogels (BN-GAs) using NH4B5O8 as precursor for B and N source by hydrothermal method and freeze-drying process. In this facile strategy, we can tune doping contents of B and N configurations in BN-GAs by simply changing the synthesis conditions. Linear sweep voltammetry results confirm that the increasing doping contents of pyridinic N and BC3 phases in BN-GAs can boost ORR activity, which may be because the enhanced synergy that arises from combining pyridinic N and BC3 phases can greatly improve ORR activity. The proposed BN-GAs not only show similar ORR activity to commercial Pt/C, but also more superior stability and excellent methanol tolerance than commercial Pt/C. Remarkably, the resultant BN-GAs also exhibit considerable OER activity and achieve desired performance as an air cathode for a rechargeable zinc-air battery device. Notably, this work may assist in a new insight to feasible preparation and molecular design of more advanced graphene-based catalyst, and can be extended to other catalytic system.

In the present study, the first-principles calculations based on interfacial model were performed to study the oxygen evolution reaction mechanism of Li2O2 supported on active surfaces of transition-metal compounds (TMC: oxides, carbides, and nitrides). Our studies indicate that the O-2 evolution and Li desorption energies show linear and volcano relationships with surface acidity of catalysts, respectively. Therefore, the charging voltage and desorption energies of Li and O-2 over TMC could correlate with their corresponding surface acidity. It is found that certain materials with an appropriate surface acidity can achieve the high catalytic activity in reducing charging voltage and activation barrier of rate-determinant step. According to this correlation, CoO should have as active catalysis as Co3O4 in reducing charging overpotential, which is further confirmed by our comparative experimental studies. Co3O4, Mo2C, TiC, and TiN are predicted to have a relatively high catalytic activity, which is consistent with the previous experiments. The present study enables the rational design of catalysts with greater activity for charging reactions of Li-O-2 battery.									76	5	0	0	4	0	76			0002-7863			WOS:000363916600024	26436336

We report herein a facile cationic-doping strategy for preparing nickel-doped cobalt sulfide embedded into a mesopore-rich hydrangea-like carbon nanoflower. Nickel cations are introduced to induce the formation of Co3+-active species and more oxygen vacancies due to higher electronegativity and smaller ionic radius, thereby strengthening the intrinsic activity for oxygen electrocatalysis. Moreover, hydrangea-like superstructure composed of interconnected carbon cages provides abundant accessible active sites and hierarchical porosity. As a result, it shows excellent catalytic performance with a superior mass activity for the oxygen reduction reaction to the state-of-the-art Pt/C catalyst and a low overpotential of 314 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) for the oxygen evolution reaction. When used as an air cathode for the rechargeable Zn-air battery, it delivers a peak power density of 96.3 mW cm(-2) and stably operates over 214 h. This work highlights the importance of cationic doping in strengthening the electrocatalytic performance of 3d-transition-metal chalcogenides.									12	0	0	0	0	0	12			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000645520700027	33856760

Designing efficient electrocatalysis combining the features of excellent electrical conductivity, abundant active surface, and structural stability remains a critical challenge. Here, we report the rational design and controlled synthesis of metallic transition metal selenide NiCo2Se4-based holey nanosheets as a highly efficient and robust OER electrocatalyst. Benefiting from synergistic effects of metallic nature, heteroatom doping, and holey nanoarchitecture, NiCo2Se4 holey nanosheets exhibit greatly enhanced kinetics and improved cycling stability for OER. When further employed as an alkaline electrolyzer, the NiCo2Se4 holey nanosheet electrocatalyst enables a high-performing overall water splitting with a low applied external potential of 1.68 Vat 10 mA cm(-2). This work not only represents a promising strategy to design the efficient and robust OER catalysts but also provides fundamental insights into the structure-property-performance relationship of transition metal selenide-based electrocatalytic materials.									214	15	0	0	7	0	216			1936-0851	1936-086X		WOS:000411918200105	28885008

Here it is shown that surface reconstruction of cobalt cyclotetraphosphate (Co2P4O12) accelerated by titanium oxide (TiO2) dramatically enhances HER and OER activity in alkaline solution. TiO2 promotes the formation of metallic cobalt at the TiO2 vertical bar Co2P4O12 interface in the HER. The resultant composite generates a current density of 20 mA cm(-2) at an overpotential of 81 mV in the alkaline HER, and the overpotential is 157 mV smaller than that of pristine Co2P4O12. The activity outperforms that of most non-precious metal electrocatalysts. The synergetic effect between Co, TiO2, and Co2P4O12 reduces the energy barrier of both the Volmer step and Heyrovsky step, inducing performance enhancement. The composite produces a current density of 20 mA cm(-2) at an overpotential of 330 mV in the OER, and the overpotential is 87 mV smaller than that of pristine Co2P4O12. The utilization of the composite as a bifunctional electrocatalyst in full water splitting cell is also demonstrated.									28	0	0	0	0	0	28			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000472219400054

Herein, we adopted a one-step electrochemical erosion method to oxidize the iron foam surface and then, iron ions in situ chelated with bi-metallic phytates to afford stereo tri-metallic compounds. The introduction of the bimetal and phytates enabled the electrode to create more catalytic sites and construct a more complicated tridimensional structure, which enlarged the active surface area and improved the water splitting performance. Consequently, the as-prepared N7CF-phy electrode delivered higher current densities at lower overpotentials for the oxygen and hydrogen evolution reactions in 1 M KOH. After being assembled as an electrolyzer for overall water splitting, the electrodes still exerted a satisfying performance. Moreover, the sustained alternating chronopotentiometric measurements for N7CF-phy as both the oxygen and hydrogen evolution reaction (OER and HER) catalysts clarified the outstanding validity and robust durability.									7	0	0	0	0	0	7			2398-4902			WOS:000503876500027

Herein, a series of hybrid Co and Fe based metal-organic frameworks (HCF-MOFs) are rationally designed and synthesized. The HCF-MOFs are directly used as electrocatalysts to enable oxygen catalysis. The unique hierarchical structure provides porous channels and ensures high exposure of metal sites, thus boosting the electrocatalytic activity. By composition regulation, the coordination environment of the active centers can be effectively modulated to achieve superior bifunctional oxygen electrocatalytic performance. Specifically, an OER overpotential of only 295 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) and an ORR half-wave potential of 0.82 V are obtained by the activated HCF-MOF, outperforming those of commercial RuO(2)and Pt/C. The results elucidate that HCF-MOF/OOH is formed during oxygen evolution, and serves as the active center. When combined with polyacrylate hydrogel electrolyte, the quasi-solid-state flexible ZAB based on HCF-MOF-3 delivers the maximum power density of 113.5 mW cm(-2), surpassing the Pt/C-RuO2 counterpart. Significantly, the battery exhibits excellent durability whilst being subjected to bending tests. This work demonstrates the prospect of these HCF-MOFs as bifunctional electrocatalysts for high-performance ZABs.									7	1	0	0	1	0	7				2566-6223		WOS:000564413200001

Introducing stress into the surface layer of catalysts represents an effective method to enhance their catalytic reactivity. Herein, we create compressive stress at the NiOOH/NiO interface using the battery conversion chemistry and in situ Ni to NiOOH transformation. As a result, the OER performance is enhanced by 20 fold compared with that of pure NiO. However, due to the corrosive environment that the electrocatalyst experiences under OER conditions, the stress is released after several CV cycles. The present study demonstrates the importance of interfacial stress that can be produced from in situ surface phase transformation of the electrocatalyst, as well as highlights the challenge of maintaining the mechanical stress under OER conditions during long-term applications.									27	0	0	0	3	0	27			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000538143000010

However, the high activity and stability of catalysts cannot be always realized simultaneously, which is apt to result in high overpotentials and poor cycling life. Herein, we elaborately construct an amorphous lanthanum-nickel-iron based oxide/hydroxide (a-LNFO) with mixed geometrical configurations of edge-and face-shared octahedra, which exhibits decent catalytic ac-tivity and excellent stability. The disordered structure endows randomly arranged terminal and bridging forms and ample oxygen vacancies, exposing massive active sites. Besides, the introduction of Ni3+ with eg orbital occupancy of 1 benefits to the favorable covalency of metal-oxygen bond, which results in the accelerated electron transport and appropriate bond strength between the catalyst and oxygen-containing intermediates, boosting the intrinsic activities toward oxygen evolution reaction and oxygen reduction reaction. Confirmed by X-ray absorption fine structure, short distance between distorted octahedra centers (Ni and Fe cations) reduces the reaction paths and induces strong electrostatic interactions, efficiently accelerating the reaction kinetics. Simultaneously, increased couples of metal-oxygen bonds in edge-and face-shared octahedra ensure the splendid stability. As a proof of concept, the a-LNFO catalyzed lithium-oxygen battery achieves a high specific discharge capacity of 13,617 mAh/g and superior cycling stability of 435 cycles. This work reveals the positive effect of geometrical configuration transformation from corner-shared octahedra to edge-and face-shared octahedra, which provides a feasible strategy for activating oxygen electrode reactions.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000867489900005

In this study, a superior OER performance was achieved using a tri-metallic (Zn, Co, Ni) high-performance electrocatalyst. We successfully fabricated a peonyflower-like hierarchical ZnCo2O4 through an additive-free hydrothermal reaction followed by heat treatment. Then NiCo-LDH (layered double hydroxides) nano-flakes was electrodeposited on the ZnCo2O4/GCE surface to prepare NiCo-LDH/ZnCo2O4/GCE which was used as electrode for OER. The structure and morphology of the catalysts were characterized by several techniques including Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction spectroscopy, field emission scanning electron microscopy, energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, elemental mapping and Brunauer-Emmett-Teller method. The NiCo-LDH/ ZnCo2O4 catalyst provided high catalytic activity toward OER under alkaline condition (1.0 M KOH) with a low overpotential of 260 mV to drive the benchmark current density of 10 mA cm = 2 and Tafel slope of 62 mV dec = 1, as well as long-term stability and high turnover frequency of 0.0641 s = 1 at overpotential of 340 mV. The NiCo-LDH/ZnCo2O4 catalyst was found to perform significantly better than NiCo-LDH, ZnCo2O4, NiCo-LDH/Co3O4, Co3O4, and commercial RuO2 catalysts. The outstanding OER performance of NiCo-LDH/ZnCo2O4 catalyst, which may be attributed to the large specific surface area, accelerated mass and synergistic effect of multiple hybrid materials, makes it a promising catalyst for OER.

Herein, we report the synthesis of in situ nitrogen-doped CNTs by CVD method on fcc NiCo alloy-silica nanocomposites in ethylene precursor containing 10% acetonitrile and their catalytic behaviour for oxygen evolution in alkaline media. The XPS analysis revealed that about 2 atomic% nitrogen was successfully doped in CNTs. Although the amount of doped nitrogen was not substantial, it played a significant role in the formation of bamboo-shaped CNTs by facilitating the conical shape of nanocatalyst. The internal core of the CNTs was analysed by TEM studies and it was found that CNTs have irregular cup and cone compartments repeated at a distance of about 50 nm. The oxygenated functional groups in the form of C=O and O-F were also found which owe their presence on the surface of CNTs to the aqueous HF treatment. The unique features like the presence of heteroatoms (N, F, O) at the graphitic planes of CNTs and its bamboo shape have collectively improved the OER performance of our synthesised carbonaceous material. As a result it exhibited OER overpotential of 315 mV at current density of 10 mA/cm(2), which was better than many reported carbonaceous materials in alkaline media.									8	0	0	0	0	0	8			2193-567X	2191-4281		WOS:000565022400007

Hybridizing transition-metal oxides with functional graphene materials has shown great advantages due to their catalytic synergism. However, both the mediocre catalytic activity of metal oxides and the restricted 2D mass/charge transfer of graphene render these hybrid catalysts inefficient. Here, an effective strategy combining anion substitution, defect engineering, and the dopant effect to address the above two critical issues is shown. This strategy is demonstrated on a hybrid catalyst consisting of sulfur-deficient cobalt oxysulfide single crystals and nitrogen-doped graphene nanomeshes (CoO0.87S0.13/GN). The defect chemistries of both oxygen-vacancy-rich, nonstoichiometric cobalt oxysulfides and edge-nitrogen-rich graphene nanomeshes lead to a remarkable improvement in electrocatalytic performance, where CoO0.87S0.13/GN exhibits strongly comparable catalytic activity to and much better stability than the best-known benchmark noble-metal catalysts. In application to quasi-solid-state zinc-air batteries, CoO0.87S0.13/GN as a freestanding catalyst assembly benefits from both structural integrity and enhanced charge transfer to achieve efficient and very stable cycling operation over 300 cycles with a low discharge-charge voltage gap of 0.77 V at 20 mA cm(-2) under ambient conditions.									105	10	0	0	1	0	107			0935-9648	1521-4095		WOS:000410762400033	28714123

Among various candidates that could tackle such a challenge, perovskite oxides are rising-star materials because of their unique structural and compositional flexibility. However, single-phase perovskite oxides are challenging to satisfy all the requirements of electrocatalysts concurrently for practical applications, such as high catalytic activity, excellent stability, good ionic and electronic conductivities, and superior chemical/thermo-mechanical robustness. Impressively, perovskite oxides with coupled nanocomposites are emerging as a novel form offering multifunctionality due to their intrinsic features, including infinite interfaces with solid interaction, tunable compositions, flexible configurations, and maximum synergistic effects between assorted components. Considering this new configuration has attracted great attention owing to its promising performances in various energy-related applications, this review timely summarizes the leading-edge development of perovskite oxide-based coupled nanocomposites.

To date, expensive electrode materials and time-consuming synthesis procedures have generally been used for the electrocatalysts applied in water splitting, which limits their efficiency. Herein, nickel-iron oxyhydroxide nanosheets are fabricated by a scalable and ultrafast (requiring only 5 s) wet chemical strategy on a nickel foam substrate. The experimental results indicate that compared to recently reported catalysts, the prepared nickel-iron oxyhydroxide electrode has a high number of active sites and low reaction barrier, enabling efficient OER catalysis in an alkaline electrolyte. In particular, the prepared nickel-iron oxyhydroxide electrode requires an ultralow overpotential of 230 mV to reach a current density of 50 mA cm(-2), with excellent long-term stability for 75 h. Moreover, the nickeliron oxyhydroxide also performs well towards the electrocatalytic urea oxidation reaction (UEOR), with a very low potential of 1.38 and 1.41 V vs RHE (reversible hydrogen electrode) to reach 50 and 100 mA cm(-2) current density in 1 M KOH with 0.33 M urea electrolyte. This ultrafast synthesis approach can be extended to prepare electrocatalysts used for other electrochemical reactions.

Here we report a simple and general synthetic protocol for fabricating a hierarchically porous and heteroatom doped carbon catalyst, which exhibited outstanding oxygen reduction/evolution activities ( with a metric potential difference of 0.72 V in 1 M KOH, the best value for metal-free catalysts reported to date) with good stability in different electrolytes. The excellent performances of the catalyst were primarily endowed by our synthetic protocol, which integrates good conductivity, abundant accessible dopant species and suitable porous architectures within an in situ pyrolysis reaction. As a result, the performances of rechargeable Zn-air batteries based on the optimized catalyst substantially outperform those afforded by a benchmark Pt/C catalyzer. Our work is expected to open up new avenues for developing other efficient catalysts in a facile and viable way.									374	27	0	0	4	0	377			1754-5692	1754-5706		WOS:000396430700006		
J	Ouhbi, H.; Aschauer, U.								Nitrogen loss and oxygen evolution reaction activity of perovskite oxynitrides [arXiv]								arXiv								15 pp.	15 pp.						5 April 2019	2019	Perovskite oxynitride photocatalysts were reported by experiment to evolve small amounts of N2 due to the self-oxidation of nitrogen ions by photo-generated holes. The N2 evolution rate was observed to decrease with increasing reaction time and was found to be correlated with a decrease in O2 evolution (OER) activity, the origin of this latter effect however being unknown. Here we investigate, by means of density functional theory calculation, anion vacancies at the TaON-terminated (001) surface of the perovskite oxynitride SrTaO2N. We find an energetic preference for oxygen and nitrogen vacancies to reside at the surface, where they are spontaneously healed by *O and *OH adsorbates under OER conditions. For nitrogen vacancies, this self-healing leads to an altered stoichiometry Ta4O8+xN4-x that is accompanied by electron doping. Substitution of N by O at the surface also leads to tensile strain, which confines the excess charge to the very surface layer, affecting the binding energy of reaction intermediates and significantly increasing the OER overpotential. This peculiar change in electronic structure thus provides an atomic scale explanation for the experimentally observed drop in OER activity of perovskite oxynitrides.									0	0	0		0	0	0						INSPEC:18918191

However developing Earth-abundant electrocatalysts for urea oxidation and hydrogen generation still remains a big challenge. Herein, porous CoS2 nanosheet self-interconnected networks with high oxidation states located on a Ti-mesh (P-CoS2/Ti) are synthesized and can act as a high activity catalyst for both the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and urea oxidation reaction (UOR). In this literature, we report a very interesting phenomenon that cobalt hydroxide with different chemical compositions and crystal structures can be synthesized by adjusting the concentration of NaOH during the etching process. Moreover, porous CoS2 nanosheets with different crystallite sizes can be synthesized by adjusting the sulfuration temperature. P-CoS2/Ti presents outstanding catalytic performance with an overpotential of 91 mV to deliver a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) for the HER, and it gives an anode potential of 1.243 V vs. RHE at 10 mA cm(-2) for the UOR. A two-electrode electrolyser is used to validate the catalyst performance, and the P-CoS2/Ti||P-CoS2/Ti electrode is capable of producing a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at a cell potential of only 1.375 V, demonstrating its potential feasibility in the practical application of efficient hydrogen production.									30	0	0	0	2	0	30			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000540759000017	32432289

While LDHs composites suffer from low intrinsic activity, which slightly impedes their wide utilization in energy conversion. Here, we demonstrate a kind of three-dimensional (3D) freestanding flower-like NiCo-LDHs materials with abundant oxygen vacancies are synthesized for electrocatalytic OER application. Simple solvent-thermal method is conducted in ethanol -N, N-dimethylformamide (DMF) mixed solution, which owns slight etching effect to obtain 3D open structures. The as-synthesized Ni1Co1-LDHs-E1D1 composite (in which molar ratio of nickel-cobalt and volume ratio of ethanol-DMF are both 1:1) is characterized with abundant oxygen vacancies on surface and ultrathin nanosheets morphology with large surface area. It exhibits a relatively low overpotential (260 mV) to drive the current density of 10 mA cm(-2) with a low Tafel slope of 72 mV dec(-1), as well as high durability in alkaline solution. This work confirms an ingenious strategy for designing 3D vacancy-rich LDHs functional electrocatalytic materials. (c) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

The analysis shows that control over at least two independent binding energies is required to obtain a reversible perfect catalyst for both ORR and OER. Often only the reactivity of the surface is changed by changing from one material to another and all binding energies scale with the reactivity. We investigate the limitation in efficiency imposed by these linear scaling relations. This analysis gives rise to a double volcano for ORR and OER, with a region in between, forbidden by the scaling relations. The reversible perfect catalyst for both ORR and OER would fall into this "forbidden region". Previously, we have found that hydrogen acceptor functionality on oxide surfaces can improve the catalytic performance for OER beyond the limitations originating from the scaling relations. We use this concept to search for promising combinations of binding sites and hydrogen donor/acceptor sites available in transition metal doped graphene, which can act as a catalyst for ORR and OER. We find that MnN4-site embedded in graphene by itself or combined with a COOH is a promising combination for a great combined ORR/OER catalyst. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Herein, a novel hollow and defect-rich Co3O4/VO2 nanohybrids (NHs) is synthesized with zeolitic imidazolate framework-67 (ZIF-67) nanocrystal as the template to anchor VO2 nanoparticles (NPs) for enhanced electrocatalytic performances. The changes of chemical composition, crystalline structure, oxygen vacancy concentration, phase boundaries of the interface between Co3O4 and VO2 are detailedly studied by TEM, XPS, ESR and UV-vis absorbance spectra, so as to clarify the interface effect of nanohybrids comprising of two transition metal oxides on its OER activity. The as-prepared oxygen vacancy-rich Co3O4/VO2 NHs show excellent electrocatalytic performance with a lower overpotential at the current density of 10 mA cm(-2) for oxygen evolution reaction (OER), which decreases in 100 mV as compared to that of Co3O4. These results confirm that the introduction of defect in the interface can not only provide more available catalytic active sites, but also efficiently stabilize the interfacial structure of the nanohybrids by depleting the stress. The greatly improved electrochemical performance of Co3O4/VO2 NHs demonstrates the importance of rational design and control of vacancy defects, which may offer a step forward in the design of advanced hybrid nanomaterials.

Herein, porous bayberry-like architectures constructed from CoFe alloy nanoparticles encapsulated within nitrogen-doped carbon nanotubes (N-CNTs) were developed by a room-temperature coprecipitation procedure, followed by an annealing process under a nitrogen atmosphere. The synergistic coupling effect between the alloys and in situ formed N-CNTs within the architectures not only provided abundant active sites and accelerated electron/proton transfer but also effectively optimized the adsorption energy of the reaction intermediates. As a result, the as-developed CoFe@N-CNTs-800 exhibited an excellent trifunctional electrocatalytic activity for the hydrogen evolution reaction and oxygen evolution reaction with overpotentials of 115 and 306 mV at 10 mA cm(-2), respectively, as well as the oxygen reduction reaction with a half-wave potential of 0.847 V vs. the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE). As a proof-of-concept, CoFe@N-CNTs-800-assembled water splitting cells could drive a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at a voltage of 1.64 V, lower than that of the Pt/C||IrO2/C couple (1.65 V). Furthermore, a CoFe@N-CNTs-800 air cathode-based zinc-air battery exhibited a very small charge-discharge voltage gap of 0.79 V (at 10 mA cm(-2)) and a high energy density of 938.1 mW h g(-1).									16	0	0	0	0	0	16			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000695213200001

These highly ordered porous inverse opal nanostructures with high surface area display synergistic properties of high energy density and promising bifunctional electrocatalytic activity toward both the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER). It is found that the as-made C-Co3O4 IO/Ketjen Black (KB) composite exhibits remarkably enhanced electrochemical performance, such as increased specific capacity (increase from 3591 to 6959 mA h g(-1)), lower charge overpotential (by 284.4 mV), lower discharge overpotential (by 19.0 mV), and enhanced cyclability (about nine times higher than KB in charge cyclability) in Li-O-2 battery. An overall agreement is found with both C-Co3O4 IO/KB and Co3O4 IO/KB in ORR and OER half-cell tests using a rotating disk electrode. This enhanced catalytic performance is attributed to the porous structure with highly dispersed carbon moiety intact with the host Co3O4 catalyst.									64	5	0	0	3	0	64			1614-6832	1614-6840		WOS:000414711100003

However, the corrosion products can be used as active materials for some electrocatalytic reactions, such as oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Herein, the oxygen corrosion on Fe foams (FF) to synthesize effective self-supporting electrocatalysts for OER, leading to "turning waste into treasure," is regulated. A dual chloride aqueous system of "NaCl-NiCl2" is employed to tailor the structures and OER properties of corrosion layers. The corrosion behaviors identify that Cl- anions serve as accelerators for oxygen corrosion, while Ni2+ cations guarantee the uniform growth of corrosion layers owing to the appeared chemical plating. The synergistic effect of "NaCl-NiCl2" generates one of the highest OER activities that only an overpotential of 212 mV is required to achieve 100 mA cm(-2) in 1.0 m KOH solution. The as-prepared catalyst also exhibits excellent durability over 168 h (one week) at 100 mA cm(-2) and promising application for overall water splitting. Specially, a large self-supporting electrode (9 x 10 cm(2)) is successfully synthesized via this cost-effective and easily scale-up approach. By combining with corrosion science, this work provides a significant stepping stone in exploring high-performance OER electrocatalysts.									38	2	0	0	0	0	40			1613-6810	1613-6829		WOS:000533242800001	32419370

Therefore, exhaustively developing low-cost bifunctional electrocatalysts is of significance especially derived from the ubiquitous carbonous biomass materials. Here, an advanced catalyst of Fe, N-dual doped mesoporous and microporous carbon nanosheets (Fe-MNC) is synthesized by using Fe pyridine coordination complex as the sources of Fe, N and corn stalk soot as the support. The Fe-MNC possesses vigorous electrocatalytic performance for ORR with an E-1/2 of 0.85 V. Moreover, for OER, the overpotential is as low as 309 mV at the current density (j) of 10 mA cm(-2) and the Tafel slope is 127 mV dec(-1). What's more, a rechargeable Zn-Air battery is constructed based on Fe-MNC as the air cathode. This work not only establishes an easy access and sustainable way to produce a cost-cutting and highly efficient ORR/OER catalyst, but also paves a new way for a greater value-added utilization of biomass carbon for sustainable energy conversation.

Functionalization has been carried out by creating a single oxygen vacancy defect as well as by incorporating substitutional doping with C, N, P, and S atoms at the O site of TiO2 HNS. The effects of functionalization and vacancy defects on the structural and electronic properties of HNS have been investigated by determining the corresponding projected density of states. It has been observed that functionalization causes a shift in the VBM and CBM of HNS, which in principle influences the catalytic activity. In addition, we have determined the work function for these materials in order to correlate them with the electrochemical activities of different considered HNSs. The catalytic activity has been predicted by determining the reaction coordinate as constructed from the free energies of the different reaction intermediates involved in HER and OER Among all of the systems that we have studied, HNS with an oxygen monovacancy has emerged as the best possible candidate for the water-splitting mechanism.									4	0	0	0	1	0	4			2574-0962			WOS:000477074700056

Among the conventionally used platinum-based heterogeneous catalysts, the high consumption and low utilization efficiency of precious platinum are the most crucial issues. Herein we present a facile approach to prepare an effective HER catalyst with platinum nanoparticles dispersed on oxygen-deficient TiO(2-x)nanosheets (NSs). The fabricated Pt-TiO2-xNS electrocatalyst shows an overpotential of 35 mV at 10 mA cm(-2)for the HER in 0.5 M H2SO4, which is highly comparable to that of commercial Pt/C (34 mV). More attractively, the Pt-TiO2-xNS electrocatalyst largely enhanced the mass activity (MA) of Pt and electrochemical stability compared to commercial Pt/C. The excellent HER performance of Pt-TiO(2-x)NSs is attributed to the synergetic effect between highly dispersed Pt species and TiO(2-x)NSs with oxygen vacancies, which enhances both electrocatalytic activity and durability over a wide pH range. This strategy can provide insights into constructing highly efficient catalysts and their support for different energy-related applications.									19	1	0	0	0	0	19			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000541868300013	32400843	
J	Ji, Jing; Zhang, Cunjin; Qin, Shuaibo; Jin, Peng				Jin, Peng/C-7280-2008				First-principles investigation of two-dimensional covalent-organic framework electrocatalysts for oxygen evolution/reduction and hydrogen evolution reactions								SUSTAINABLE ENERGY & FUELS				5	21			5615	5626		10.1039/d1se01257f		SEP 2021		OCT 26 2021	2021	The oxygen evolution reaction (OER), oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) all have attracted much attention due to their utmost importance for clean and renewable energy applications. As emerging versatile nanomaterials, covalent-organic frameworks (COFs) can serve as OER/ORR/HER electrocatalysts, but their potential remains largely underexplored thus far. In this work, based on the structure of COF-366-Co achieved in recent experiments, first-principles calculations were conducted to investigate the electrocatalytic performances of fifteen two-dimensional (2D) M-COFs (M = Sc-Zn, Ru, Rh, Pd, Ag, Ir) containing various metalloporphyrin active centers. The results reveal that all the M-COFs bear fully exposed, atomically dispersed, thermodynamically and electrochemically stable metal sites, as required by the ideal single-atom catalysts. According to the thermodynamic calculations, the Co-COF and Ir-COF are perfect OER catalysts with rather low theoretical overpotentials (eta(OER): 0.38 and 0.34 V). The Mn-COF, Fe-COF, and Rh-COF are also promising for the OER (eta(OER): 0.62, 0.57 and 0.51 V). Moreover, the Co-COF can readily catalyze the ORR (eta(ORR): 0.23 V) as well, and is thus a potential OER/ORR bifunctional catalyst. The Mn-COF and Fe-COF are also favorable for both ORR (eta(ORR): 0.50 and 0.39 V) and HER (eta(HER): 0.08 and 0.10 V), and may serve as OER/ORR/HER trifunctional catalysts. Their excellent performances stem from the suitable metal d bands, which cause optimal bindings for all the key intermediate species along the reaction pathway. The current work not only finds several 2D-COFs as promising electrocatalysts, but also elucidates their exact structure-activity relationship, which is useful for the rational design of more single-atom catalysts.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			2398-4902			WOS:000705803700001

Here, a highly active and durable bifunctional electrocatalyst for PEM electrolyzers based on a rattle-like catalyst comprising a Ni/Ru-doped Pt core and a Pt/Ni-doped RuO2 frame shell, which is topotactically transformed from an icosahedral Pt/Ni/Ru nanocrystal, is reported. The RuO2-based frame shell with its highly reactive surfaces leads to a very high activity for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in acidic media, reaching a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at an overpotential of 239 mV, which surpasses those of previously reported catalysts. The Pt dopant in the RuO2 shell enables a sustained OER activity even after a 2000 cycles of an accelerated durability test. The Pt-based core catalyzes the hydrogen evolution reaction with an excellent mass activity. A two-electrode cell employing Pt/RuO2 as the electrode catalyst demonstrates very high activity and durability, outperforming the previously reported cell performances.									67	0	0	0	1	0	67			0935-9648	1521-4095		WOS:000454786200002	30362625

Here, we report that a degraded electrocatalyst can be revivified under catalytic operating conditions by manipulating reversible phase segregation. Under the oxygen evolution reaction conditions, Fe segregation develops in the Ni-Fe hydroxide host lattice, with the formation of FeOOH, resulting in an interface between the FeOOH and the host lattice. A dynamic metal dissolution-redeposition process accelerates the Fe segregation and formation of the FeOOH secondary phase, resulting in catalyst deactivation. Operando synchrotron spectroscopic and microscopic analyses suggest that the phase segregation is reversible between the water oxidation potential and the catalyst reduction potential. Therefore, we have developed an intermittent reduction methodology to revivify the catalytic activity under the operating conditions, enhancing catalyst durability. The present study highlights that tailoring phase segregation at the catalyst/electrolyte interface constitutes an important strategy for revivifying and stabilizing catalytic activity.									82	3	0	0	3	0	82			2520-1158			WOS:000562347700002

This combination has been reported to be an efficient electrocatalyst for oxygen reduction reaction. Higher efficiency is achieved by using the size controlled BNNS (<1 mu m) for the modification and the highest efficiency is achieved at Au electrode modified with the smallest BNNS ( 0.1-0.22 mu m) used in this study where overpotentials are only 30 mV and 40 mV larger than those at Pt electrode, which is known to be the best electrode for HER, at 5 mAcm(-2) and at 15 mAcm(-2), respectively. Theoretical evaluation suggests that some of edge atoms provide energetically favored sites for adsorbed hydrogen, i.e., the intermediate state of HER. This study opens a new route to develop HER electrocatalysts.									52	1	0	0	4	0	52			2045-2322			WOS:000381866700001	27558958

However, the commercial oxygen electrocatalysts (mainly noble metal based) can only exhibit either ORR or OER activity and also suffer from inherent cost and stability issues. It remains challenging to achieve efficient ORR and OER bifunctionality on a single catalyst. Metal-free structures offer relatively large scope for this bifunctionality to be engineered within one catalyst, together with improved cost-effectiveness and durability. Herein, by closely coupled computational design and experimental development, highly effective bifunctionality was achieved in a phosphorus and nitrogen co-doped graphene framework (PNGF) - with both ORR and OER activities reaching the theoretical limits of metal-free catalysts, superior to their noble metal counterparts in both (bi)functionality and durability. In particular, with the identification of active P-N sites for OER and N-doped sites for ORR, we successfully intensified these sites by one-pot synthesis to tailor the PNGF. The resulting catalyst achieved an ORR potential of 0.845 V vs. RHE at 3 mA cm(-2) and an OER potential of 1.55 V vs. RHE at 10 mA cm(-2). Its combined ORR and OER overpotential of 705 mV is much lower than those previously reported for metal-free bifunctional catalysts.									318	17	0	0	9	0	322			1754-5692	1754-5706		WOS:000401408500013		
J	Huang, Hao; Feng, Xun; Du, Cuicui; Wu, Siyuan; Song, Wenbo								Incorporated oxygen in MoS2 ultrathin nanosheets for efficient ORR catalysis								JOURNAL OF MATERIALS CHEMISTRY A				3	31			16050	16056		10.1039/c5ta01600b				2015	2015	Controllable engineering of high-electronegativity oxygen (O)-heteroatoms into MoS2 ultrathin nanosheets is realized via a facile post-modification process. The incorporated oxygen atoms impart a dramatically enhanced ORR activity to the pristine nanosheets, with a 7.8-fold current increase as well as 180 mV and 160 mV positive shifts in both onset and half-wave potentials that are almost comparable with the commercial Pt/C catalyst. Furthermore, oxygen incorporation also triggers a transformation of the process from two-electron to a four-electron process. The improved topical conductivity, as well as the preferential adsorption of oxygen molecules originating from the heteroatoms engineering is supposed to be responsible for the efficient ORR. The prospect of controllably engineering heteroatoms into MoS2 ultrathin nanosheets with versatile applications is also highlighted in this work.									71	6	0	0	5	0	72			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000358722200031

In this work, we construct a Ba0.5Sr0.5Co0.8Fe0.2O3-delta (BSCF)-ceria (CeO2) hybriding oxygen redox catalyst (BSCCF-NF-H) by imitating the structure and function of fish gills. In our BSCCF-NF-H catalyst, the perovskite nanofibers with the diameter of 200 nm prepared by electrospinning can imitate gill filaments to transfer oxygen species, while the CeO2 nanoparticles uniformly growing on the surface of perovskite nanofibers by exsolution method can imitate lamellas to adsorb oxygen. Thanks to the biomimetic structure and function, BSCCF-NF-H shows the greatly enhanced catalytic activity toward both oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) com-paring with the pristine BSCF. BSCCF-NF-H shows the low potential at 10 mA cm(-2) (E-j=10) of 1.62 V toward OER and half-wave potential (E-1/2) of 0.66 V toward ORR. Also, the bifunctional stabilities of BSCCF-NF-H are much higher than that of BSCF after the long-term durability tests. Benefiting from these advantages, BSCCF-NF-H is successfully applied as the bifunctional oxygen redox catalyst for aqueous and solid-state flexible zinc-air batteries (ZABs). Our work can provide an inspiring way for further explorations of high-performance perovskite oxygen redox catalyst. (C) 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

Uniformity was maintained throughout the investigation, from synthesis method to electrochemical tests, so that a comparison can be made for the various carbides for their catalytic activities towards hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). Catalytic activities are dependent on synthesis method which determines the properties of the catalyst, and electrochemical conditions. Maintaining uniformity throughout the investigation allows for a more balanced comparison of a family of materials. Activity of all nine carbides show increased HER activity compared to bare glassy carbon working electrode. Mo2C, WC, and V8C7 show particularly enhanced HER activity. Similarly, Mo2C, Cr3C2, and V8C7 have significant ORR activities. Using a wet impregnation method, dispersed platinum nanoparticles ranging between 3 and 5 nm were successfully deposited on the carbides. The Pt deposited carbides have as much as three times higher HER activity and four times higher ORR activity compared to commercially available Pt/C catalyst, and show enhanced stability under fuel cell conditions.									119	5	0	0	2	0	123			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000353927500092

However, graphene based SACs are primarily bonded with nitrogen and carbon sites, resulting in poor performance for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Herein, we develop a general bimetal-ion adsorption strategy for the synthesis of individually dispersed Ni SACs anchored on the oxygenated sites of ultrathin reduced graphene oxide as efficient OER electrocatalysts. The resultant Ni SACs for OER in alkaline electrolyte exhibit a highly stable overpotential of 328 mV at the current density of 10 mA cm(-2), and Tafel slope of 84 mV dec(-1) together with long-term durability and negligible degradation for 50 h, which is greatly outperform its counterparts of nitrogen bonded Ni SACs (564 mV, 364 mV dec(-1)) and Ni(OH)(2) nanoparticles anchored on graphene (450 mV, 142 mV dec(-1)), and most reported Ni based OER electrocatalysts. Furthermore, the extended X-ray absorption fine structure at the Ni K-edge and theoretical simulation reveal that the nickel-oxygen coordination significantly boost OER performance. Therefore, this work will open numerous opportunities for creating novel-type 2D SACs via oxygen-metal bonding as highly robust OER catalysts.

Usually, the crucial oxygen reduction reaction and oxygen evolution reaction are naturally lethargic and require efficient catalysts to kinetically boost the energy conversion processes to achieve the practicable ZABs application. Transition-metal/carbon hybrid catalysts show excellent potentials in electrocatalysis, and they have been developed into cost-effective and scalable oxygen electrocatalyst alternatives for expensive and scarcer noble metal ones in rechargeable ZABs. Herein we summarize recent achievements in transition metal/carbon hybrids for oxygen electrocatalysis. These catalysts mainly fall into two categories by the integrated metal/metal oxides nanoparticles and atomically dispersed transition metal/carbon matrix. We focus on the relationship between structure and performance with their synthesis strategies. Their application in rechargeable ZABs are also comprehensively discussed. Finally, the perspectives on transition metal/carbon hybrids for oxygen electrocatalysis are presented for the future challenges in rechargeable ZABs.									32	1	0	0	4	0	32				2567-3173		WOS:000682527600002

In this paper, CeO2 nanoparticles on N-doped reduced graphene oxide (CeO2@N-RGO) are in-situ synthesized through a one-step hydrothermal process as binder-free cathode catalyst.

The performance enhancement of the battery can be attributed to the synergetic effect of N-RGO and CeO2 nanoparyicles anchoring the formation of Li2O2.

There are, however, significant challenges to practical implementation, including low energy efficiency, cycle life, and power capability. These are due primarily to the lack of fundamental understanding of oxygen reduction and evolution reaction kinetics and parasitic reactions between oxygen redox intermediate species and nominally inactive battery components such as carbon in the oxygen electrode and electrolytes. In this article, we discuss recent advances in the mechanistic understanding of oxygen redox reactions in nonaqueous electrolytes and the search for electrolytes and electrode materials that are chemically stable in the oxygen electrode.

In this study, it is presented that a deliberately deposited amorphous FeOOH layer can drastically promote the electrocatalytic OER activity of CoSe2. Unlike the pristine CoSe2 which is consumed gradually, the amorphous FeOOH layer facilitates the capture and fixation of dissolved Co2+ ions, which is confirmed by the stable element contents during OER process. As a result, a low overpotential of 253 mV (@ j = 40 mA cm(-2)) is displayed by CoSe2@FeOOH nanorod arrays (NAs) on carbon cloth (CC) with a small Tafel slope of 69 mV dec(-1), which are comparable or even lower than the state-of-the-art OER electrocatalysts. In addition, the long-time durability test indicates the remarkable stability of this material over 20 h. These outcomes provide new perception in design and large scale fabrication of cheap yet effective heterostructured OER catalysts.									8	0	0	0	0	0	8			2196-7350			WOS:000588359300001

A molecular strategy of preparing highly ordered FePt NPs was used by direct pyrolysis of a Fe, Pt-containing bimetallic complex. The resultant L1(0)-FePt NPs had very high crystallinity as reflected by the obvious diffraction patterns, clear lattice fringes and characteristic X-ray diffraction peaks, etc. Besides, the strong ferromagnetism with room temperature coercivity of 27 kOe further confirmed the face-centered tetragonal (fct) phase in good agreement with the ordered nanostructures. The FePt NPs can be used as electrocatalysts to catalyze oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in an O-2-saturated 0.1 M HClO4 solution and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in the 0.5 M H2SO4 electrolyte with much better performance than commercial Pt/C, and showed quite high stability after 10,000 cycles. The strategy utilizing organometallic precursors to prepare metal alloy NPs was demonstrated to be a reliable approach for improving the catalytic efficiency in fuel cells.									39	4	0	0	0	0	39			1998-0124	1998-0000		WOS:000492360300001

In this study, the electronic structures and catalytic performance of recently synthesized transition-metal monochalcogenide (MX, M = Cr, Mo, W; X = S, Se, Te) nanowires (NWs) were systemically investigated based on first-principles calculations. The results demonstrate that these MX NWs can be deemed as efficient bi-functional catalysts for the OER/ORR. In particular, the low overpotentials of CrTe NWs are even superior to those of the well-known noble catalysts. To study the origin of excellent electrocatalytic performance, we establish linear relationships between the adsorption strength of intermediates and the overpotentials. A comparison study reveals that the NWs exhibit better catalytic performance than the corresponding two-dimensional materials, indicating the superiority of the unique NW structures for catalysis. These computational results offer not only a new family of bi-functional OER/ORR catalysts, but also a promising perspective for the development of stable, low-cost and highly active non-noble electrocatalysts.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000545599900018	32520041

However, realizing the high degree of fusion of two different metal components to form heterointerfaces remains a great challenge, since the different metal components tend to grow separately in most cases. Herein, by employing carboxyl-modified carbon nanotubes to stabilize different metal ions, the engineering of abundant Ni|MnO heterointerfaces is achieved in porous carbon nanofibers (Ni|MnO/CNF) during the electrospinning-calcination process. Remarkably, the resulting Ni|MnO/CNF catalyst exhibits activities that are among the best reported for the catalysis of both the oxygen reduction and oxygen evolution reactions. Moreover, the catalyst also demonstrates high power density and long cycle life in Zn-air batteries. Its superior electrochemical properties are mainly ascribed to the synergy between the engineering of oxygen-deficient Ni|MnO heterointerfaces with a strong Ni/Mn alloying interaction and the 1D porous CNF support. This facile anchoring strategy for the initiation of bimetallic heterointerfaces creates appealing opportunities for the potential use of heteronanomaterials in practical sustainable energy applications.									70	6	0	0	1	0	71			1616-301X	1616-3028		WOS:000512027100001

Thus, lower the voltage of an electrolyzer is one of the critical routes to solve this issue. Here we apply carbon black Vulcan XC-72, carbon nanotubes, and graphene oxide (named as 3C) to construct an effective bifunctional iron cobalt phosphide (FeCoP/3C) electrocatalyst, the electrocatalytic activity toward oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) was respectively investigated. The FeCoP/3C electrocatalyst shows overpotential of 220 mV and 120 mV at current density of 10 mA cm(-2), Tafel slope of 73 mV dec(-1) and 129 mV dec(-1) for OER and HER in 1 M KOH electrolyte, respectively. When the electrocatalyst is used to construct an overall water electrolyzer, a cell voltage of 1.597 V can be achieved at current density of 10 mA cm(-2). Moreover, the FeCoP/3C displays excellent durability toward overall water splitting, because the current density retains 92% after working for 10 h continuously. This outstanding performance is mainly attributed to the electrocatalyst possessing excellent electrical conductivity, exposing sufficient active sites, facilitating fast ions transportation and electron transfer, as well as speeding up O-2 and H-2 release. Therefore, this FeCoP/3C electrocatalyst can be a promising bifunctional electrocatalyst for practical overall water splitting.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			1293-2558	1873-3085		WOS:000709370200003

Conventional catalysts involve the alloying of rare elements, limiting their wide applications. In this paper, Mn doped ultrathin Ni-Fe-O nanosheets are prepared and demonstrated as an efficient OER catalyst. Mn dopant induces the generation of high valence state Ni(3+)sites and an increased oxygen vacancy concentration in the Mn-Ni-Fe-O nanosheets, thus achieving enhanced OER kinetics. Experimentation of various dopant concentrations reveals that 2 wt% Mn doping is optimal for OER catalytic performance, achieving low overpotentials of 225 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2)and 297 mV at 100 mA cm(-2), respectively, a small Tafel slope of 38.2 mV dec(-1), and excellent stability in an alkaline medium, which is superior to pristine Ni-Fe-O nanosheets and the state-of-the-art RuO(2)catalyst.									19	1	0	0	0	0	19				2052-1537		WOS:000545448500005

Introducing defect structures in metal oxides such as pyrochlores and perovskites has proved to be an effective strategy to enhance electrocatalytic activity. However, it is hard to build numerous defect sites in such high-temperature oxides due to the strong metal-oxygen bonds and the so-called self-purification effect, which becomes increasingly important as the particle size reduced to the nanoscale. Here, a facile strategy is demonstrated to fabricate defect-rich yttrium ruthenate oxides Y2Ru2O7-delta with the pyrochlore structure (denoted D-rich-YRO) by the liquid nitrogen (<-196 degrees C) quenching. Owing to the almost instantaneous cooling in oxygen-deficient condition, a large number of defects-including oxygen vacancies, grain boundaries, pores and surficial disorder-are preserved in the room temperature material and act as electrocatalytic active sites for oxygen evolution. As a result, D-rich-YRO shows excellent catalytic activity and high electrochemical stability, along with a high performance in the operation of proton exchange membrane electrolyzer. The quenching strategy employed in this work provides a facile approach for constructing defect-rich structures in high-temperature oxides and should lead to new applications in energy conversion and storage devices for such materials.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			2366-9608			WOS:000722447300001	35041267

However, they often suffer from complicated preparation methods. The optimized conditions hide in a narrow window and require a large amount of screening work. Moreover, the porous support may collapse during high temperature, resulting in dead volume and low atomic usage efficiency. Herein we report a facile build-up of atomically dispersed Fe single metal site (Fe-N-C) derived from Fe-doped thermalized covalent triazine frameworks (TTF) towards bifunctional ORR/OER catalysts. The TTF-derived carbon provides a platform for the formation and uniform dispersion of single-atom Fe-N catalytic centers. A high electrocatalytic behavior towards ORR (E-1/2 = 0.891 V) and OER (E-j (= 10) = 1.543 V) in alkaline medium is achieved with excellent stability and anti-methanol poisoning activity. Impressively, its metal mass activity is 62 times higher than commercial 20 wt% Pt/C. The Zn-air battery (ZAB) based on the catalyst achieves a high capacity of 783.2 mAh g(-1), a low voltage gap of 0.55 V and an outstanding rechargeability of 1650 cycles (~550 h), placing it as one of the best-performing ZABs.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0378-7753	1873-2755		WOS:000826734900003

Herein, we for the first time discover an interesting core-shell structure formation driven by the Kirkendall effect in a nanostructured FeNi alloy incorporating S, N-doped carbon (FeNi/SN-C) and this structural transformation can greatly boost the alloy's catalytic ability for OER. Thermal annealing of FeNi/SN-C in air induces the formation of an Fe-rich Fe-Ni oxide shell over the Fe-Ni alloy core due to the different metal diffusion rates and oxygen coupling abilities. As a powder catalyst, an overpotential as low as 230 mV can drive 10 mA cm(-2), about 30 mV less than the original catalyst; it outperforms most nonprecious metal catalysts and noble commercial IrO2 catalysts. The catalytic performances are probably derived from the oxidized Fe-rich oxidation shell in contact with the conductive FeNi/SN-C host, which chemically stabilizes and further activates the active sites formed during the reaction. It is also concluded that exposure of the metal oxide shell contributes more to the activity than the large surface area contributed by the porous carbon matrix. This work puts forward a novel and efficient strategy to optimize Fe-Ni-based catalysts for OER by in situ structure and morphology tuning.									54	2	0	0	2	0	54			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000448419900061	30178814

Key to the improvement of catalytic performance lies the development of efficient catalytic electrodes. Besides the exploration of highly active catalysts, the fast removal of the gas products on the electrode surface should be realized because the adhered gas bubbles would block the following catalytic reactions and decrease the efficiency. In this paper, we introduce an ideal structure, a ldquosuperaerophobicrdquo surface, to diminish the negative effects caused by the adhered gas bubbles. Several recent works focusing on addressing this issue are presented with the target reactions of hydrogen evolution and oxygen evolution. It is demonstrated that micro/nano-engineering of the catalyst directly on the current collector is a promising approach to minimize the negative effective induced by the gas bubble adhesion.

FeNiSNBC/C exhibits the OER overpotential of 216 mV at the current density of 10 mA cm-2, as well as with the excellent ORR performance. The low OER overpotential reduces the oxidation corrosion in the rechargeable zinc-air batteries. The zinc-air battery with a liquid electrolyte assembled using FeNiS-NBC/C exhibited the power density of 133.0 mW cm-2 and specific capacity of 797.8 mAh g-1. The solid-state zinc-air battery assembled using FeNiS-NBC/C exhibited the power density of 61.4 mW cm-2 and can be stably charge-discharge cycled for 46 h. This work pointed out a novel avenue to construct bifunctional catalysts in the future for advanced zinc-air batteries.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2168-0485			WOS:000876811700001

Herein, we designed the fabrication of NiFe layered double hydroxide (LDH) nanoplates supported on nitrogen doped TiO2 nanotube arrays as a superior OER electrocatalyst and investigated the impacts of NiFe-LDH loading and nitrogen doping concentration on electrocatalytic performance. When the load and nitrogen content are 0.6 mg cm(-2) and 20.9%, respectively, the NiFe/N-TiO2 exhibits outstanding OER properties and requires a lower overpotential of only 235 mV to achieve the current density of 10 mA cm(-2) with a smaller Tafel slope of 48.9 mV dec(-1) and admirable durability. The enhanced OER performance of the composite is attributed to the intimate coupling of LDH-based catalysts with intrinsically high activity and N-TiO2 substrate with the large surface area and vertical nanotube structure. Moreover, nitrogen doping not only increases the electrical conductivity but also weakens the NiFe LDHs' surface-oxygen interaction, resulting in suitable bond strength of oxygen-related intermediate species. Our findings expand the development of designing novel composite nanostructures for promising OER catalysts.									30	2	0	0	2	0	31			2574-0962			WOS:000483434700073		
J	Qi, Xuyao; Chen, Liangzhou; Tang, Jie; Xin, Haihui; Liang, Zhongqiu								Reaction model and thermodynamic properties between sulfur-containing active groups and oxygen during coal self-heating								CANADIAN JOURNAL OF CHEMISTRY				99	1			31	42		10.1139/cjc-2020-0099				JAN 2021	2021	To further study the mechanism of coal self-heating, the reaction sequences and thermodynamic properties between sulfur-containing groups and oxygen during coal self-heating were analyzed. The benzyl mercaptan and diphenyl sulfide were selected as typical sulfur-containing structures existing in coal. Their structural parameters, frontier orbital characteristics, and thermodynamic parameters were analyzed through quantum chemistry calculation and their detailed reaction sequences with oxygen were proposed. The results indicate that the thiol structure in coal can easily react with oxygen at low temperatures and release large amounts of heat (146.70 kJ/mol) during coal self-heating, providing active free radicals and energy for subsequent chain reactions of coal spontaneous combustion. The oxidation reaction between the thioether structure and oxygen cannot occur at room temperature. With the accumulation of heat, thioether gradually becomes active and reacts with oxygen to form sulfoxide and release an enormous amount of heat (248.09 kJ/mol), which can be further oxidized to sulfone with an increase in temperature. The reaction models of thiol and thioether groups during coal self-heating were proposed, which involves eight main reaction sequences (R1 similar to R8). It indicates that the reactions of thiol and thioether groups play crucial roles during the evolution of coal self-heating, with a slow oxidation stage at low temperatures and an accelerated oxidation stage at high temperatures.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			0008-4042	1480-3291		WOS:000609162300005

The electrocatalysts are critical to enhance the efficiency of metal-air cells and fuel cells. In this study, a one-pot vapor deposition method was used to realize the synchronously dope of N and Ni (trace) into Co/C to form Co-Ni (trace)/N-doped carbon nanotubes (Co-Ni (trace)/NCNTs). An interesting result is that injecting dicyandiamide (DCD) into Ni foam as a precursor led to the in situ formation of NCNTs, with synchronous doping of trace Ni into Co species. The cooperative effects of the Co-Ni (trace) and N-doped carbon nanotubes resulted in superior dual-functional electrocatalytic performance of Co-Ni (trace)/NCNTs for the ORR (half-wave potential E-1/2 vs. RHE: 0.83 V, electron transfer number n: 3.97) and OER (overpotential vs. RHE: 337 mV at 10 mA cm(-2), Tafel slope: 94.0 mV dec(-1)). Moreover, the Co-Ni (trace)/NCNTs catalyst showed excellent stability during 20,000 s of durability testing for both ORR and OER. This study provides a feasible strategy for designing efficient nonnoble metal-catalysts for renewable energy conversion devices. (C) 2021 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Dynamic electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) is employed here to probe the reaction interface in a Li-O-2 battery under potentiostatic and galvanostatic modes. Two impedance semicircles are identified during discharge with the high- and the low-frequency ones related to the Li2O2 film and the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), respectively. However, upon triggering the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), only one semicircle is observed, implying that the reaction interface changes. Combining qualitative analysis on the EIS structure and quantitative information obtained from model fitting reveals that the ORR. occurs on the Li2O2-electrolyte interface during discharge and the OER occurs on the electrode surface during charge. In addition, it is found that the electronic conductivity of Li2O2 is higher at oxidative potentials (charge) than reductive potentials (discharge). Discharge-charge differences in the reaction interface and the electronic conductivity reported here expand the scope of discharge-charge asymmetries of Li-O-2 batteries.									18	0	0	0	1	0	19			1948-7185			WOS:000436382400038	29864272

Herein, we report a facile and effective one-pot solvothermal route to synthesize mesoporous Mo-x-Co-O hybrid nanosheets (NSs) which is composed of crystalline Mo4O11 and amorphous cobalt hydroxide. Due to the corrosion of 1-octylamine at high temperatures, abundant mesoporous holes are created in situ over the Mo-x-Co-O hybrid NSs during the solvothermal process, which is beneficial to increasing the electrochemical surface area. The dimension of the Mo-x-Co-O NSs, size of mesoporous and the concentration of defects can be easily modulated by controlling the molar ratio of Mo/Co. Electrochemical mea- surements reveal that the 2D mesoporous Mo-x-Co-O NSs show an excellent activity for the oxygen evolution reaction with the highest catalytic activity of eta(10) = 276 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) in 1 mol L-1 KOH. Enhanced adsorption of intermediates and abundant oxygen vacancies achieved by appropriate Mo doping are the two main factors that contribute to the excellent catalytic activity of Mo-0.2-Co-O NSs. This work, with the construction of 2D metal-oxide (hydroxide) crystalline-amorphous nanomaterials possessing abundant holes, oxygen vacancies and enhanced adsorption of intermediates, provides important insight on the design of more efficient catalysts.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2095-8226	2199-4501		WOS:000825910500003

The molecular orbital calculations by the use of general spin orbitals (GSO) are performed for cubane-type calcium manganese cluster 2 with noncollinear spin alignment, which has also been concluded in our previous studies of 1 and 3. The calculated results, together with available experiments, enable us to propose possible electronic states (from S-0 to S-4) of tetranuclear manganese cluster 5, which is the active site of oxygen evolution center (OEC). The low-spin (LS) ground states of 2-5 are consistent with the ESR and other magnetic observations. A new reaction scheme for oxygen evolution from water is resulted from both theoretical and experimental results for manganese clusters 1-5 in OEC on the basis of the newly determined X-ray structure by Ferreira et al. [Science 303 (2004) 183 1]. In this mechanism, both calcium and manganese ions play important roles for formation of peroxide anion bridge, which is the precursor of molecular oxygen. Implications of computational results are discussed in relation to a key role of the high-valent manganese oxo (Mn(V)=O) species in OEC for oxygen evolution from water. Our previous and present computations conclude that Mn(V)=O plays a crucial role in both native and artificial OEC systems.

In this mechanism, the OOHads reaction intermediate, which unfavorably affects the overall OER activity due to the linear scaling relationship, is replaced by O-2 adsorbed at the active site on FeOOH and H-ads adsorbed at the NiOOH substrate. Here, we use the computational hydrogen electrode method to assess promising models of both the FeOOH catalyst and the NiOOH hydrogen acceptor. These two materials are interfaced in various ways to evaluate their performance as bifunctional OER catalysts. In some cases, overpotentials as low as 0.16 V are found, supporting the bifunctional mechanism as a means to overcome the limitations imposed by linear scaling relationships.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			0021-9606	1089-7690		WOS:000609824500002	33445894

The main characteristics of the direct and back reactions of the cycle are described. Special attention is paid to analysis of the functions of the cycle related to photosynthesis-participation in oxygen evolution and protection of the photosynthetic apparatus from photodestruction. These complementary functions exhibit various properties of the cycle. Evidence confirming these functions is given. The relationship between the violaxanthin cycle and oxygen evolution was indicated by experiments employing inhibitors of photosynthetic oxygen evolution and incubation in (H2O)-O-18 (the label was incorporated into violaxanthin during photosynthesis). The protective role of the violaxanthin cycle increases under stressful conditions and is related to zeaxanthin accumulation (one of the pigments of the cycle). The amount of zeaxanthin correlated with the quenching of chlorophyll fluorescence. Directions for the further investigation of these problems are suggested.									6	0	0	0	4	0	6			1021-4437			WOS:A1996UP89300013

Herein, we report NiFeMoOx nanosheets as high-performance OER electrocatalyst through promoting the thermodynamic-limiting oxidation cycle process in NiFe oxyhydroxide via high-valence Mo doping. The NiFeMoOx nanosheets are prepared by an elaborate in-situ solvothermal etching-depositing process with NiFe alloy framework as substrate and metal precursors. The resultant nanosheets exhibit outstanding alkaline OER activity, requires only 235/282/327 mV overpotentials to achieve current density of 10/100/300 mA cm(-2), respectively, with a good long-term stability at 20 mA cm(-2) for 72 h. Besides, the Tafel slope low to 28.1 mV dec(-1) indicates a favorable OER kinetics. The superior catalytic activity of NiFeMoOx nanosheets should be attributed to the lower oxidation states of Ni and Fe induced by high-valence dopant, leading to easier surface reconstruction at low charge oxidation cycling during OER, thereby effectively reducing the overpotential. The synergy between the electronic effect among multimetallic sites and the unique morphology is expected to inspire the development of robust OER electrocatalyst for industrial application.

USE - The method is useful for preparing a sheet-shaped cobalt-layered double hydroxide zinc-air battery catalyst. ADVANTAGE - The method: prepares the sheet-shaped cobalt-layered double hydroxide zinc-air battery catalyst under non-calcined conditions with high catalytic activity, oxygen evolution reaction and oxygen reduction reaction dual-function electrocatalytic activity, and large specific surface area; avoids the collapse of the channels due to calcination and the structural variation of cobalt-layered double hydroxide caused by calcination; and inhibits the tendency of electrical performance attenuation.

Herein, a selective semi-dehydrogenation of tetrahydroisoquinolines (THIQs) is demonstrated to replace the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) for boosting H-2 evolution reaction (HER) in water over a Ni2P nanosheet electrode. The value-added semi-dehydrogenation products, dihydroisoquinolines (DHIQs), can be selectively obtained with high yields at the anode. The controllable semi-dehydrogenation is attributed to the in situ formed Ni-II/Ni-III redox active species. Such a strategy can deliver a variety of DHIQs bearing electron-withdrawing/donating groups in good yields and excellent selectivities, and can be applied to gram-scale synthesis. A two-electrode Ni2P bifunctional electrolyzer can produce both H-2 and DHIQs with robust stability and high Faradaic efficiencies at a much lower cell voltage than that of overall water splitting.									132	14	0	0	10	0	133			1433-7851	1521-3773		WOS:000479153800001	31268216

Due to the unique physical and chemical properties, borophene has various potential applications. In this review, we summarize the progress on borophene with a particular emphasis on the recent advances. First, we introduce the phases of borophene by experimental synthesis and theoretical predictions. Then, the physical and chemical properties, such as mechanical, thermal, electronic, optical and superconducting properties are summarized. We also discuss in detail the utilization of the borophene for wide ranges of potential application among the alkali metal ion batteries, Li-S batteries, hydrogen storage, supercapacitor, sensor and catalytic in hydrogen evolution, oxygen reduction, oxygen evolution, and CO2 electroreduction reaction. Finally, the challenges and outlooks in this promising field are featured on the basis of its current development. [Front.

Nickel-iron (NiFe) (oxy)hydroxides are promising pre-electrocatalysts for alkaline OER. However, OER performances are limited by the slow reconstruction process to generate active species of high-valance NiFe oxyhydroxides. In this work, a sulfate ion (SO42-) modulated strategy is developed to boost the OER activity of NiFe (oxy)hydroxide by accelerating the electrochemical reconstruction of pre-catalyst and stabilizing the reaction intermediate of OOH* during OER. The SO42- decorated NiFe (oxy)hydroxide catalyst (NF-S0.15) is fabricated via scalable anodization of NiFe foam in a thiourea-dissolved electrolyte. The experimental and theoretical investigations demonstrate the dual effect of SO42- on improving OER performances. SO42- leaching is favorable for the electrochemical reconstruction to form active NiFeOOH under OER condition. Simultaneously, the residual SO42- adsorbed on surface can stabilize the intermediate of OOH*, and thus enhance the OER performances. As expected, NF-S0.15 delivers an ultralow overpotential of 234 mV to reach the current density of 50 mA cm(-2), a fast OER kinetics (27.7 mV dec(-1)), and a high stability for more than 100 h. This unique insights into anionic modification could inspire the development of advanced electrocatalysts for efficient OER.									42	2	0	0	1	0	42			1616-301X	1616-3028		WOS:000669118900001		
J	Olesen, K; Andreasson, LE								The function of the chloride ion in photosynthetic oxygen evolution								BIOCHEMISTRY				42	7			2025	2035		10.1021/bi026175y				FEB 25 2003	2003	The involvement of Cl- and several other monovalent anions in photosynthetic oxygen evolution was studied using photosystem 11 membranes depleted of Cl- by dialysis. The results of these studies differ significantly from results obtained using other depletion methods. Binding studies with glycerol as a cryoprotectant confirm our previous observations with sucrose of two interconvertible binding states of photosystem 11 with similar activities and with slow or fast exchange, respectively, of the bound ion. With glycerol, Cl- depletion decreased the oxygen evolution rate to 55% of that with Cl- present without decreasing the quantum efficiency of the reaction, supporting our previous conclusion that oxygen evolution can proceed at high rates in the absence of Cl-. Further, after Cl- depletion the S-2 state multiline signal displayed the same periodic appearance with the same signal yield after consecutive laser flashes as with Cl- present. Br-, I-, and NO3-, although with different capacities to reactivate oxygen evolution, also showed two binding modes. I- inhibited when bound in the low-affinity, fast-exchange mode but activated in the high-affinity mode. A comparison of the EPR properties of the S-2 state with these anions suggests that the nature of the ion or the binding mode only has a minor influence on the environment of the manganese. In contrast, F- completely inhibited oxygen evolution by preventing the S-2 to S-3 transition and shifted the equilibrium between the g = 4.1 and multiline S-2 forms toward the former, which suggests a considerable perturbation of the manganese cluster. To explain these and earlier observations, we propose that the role of chloride in the water-splitting mechanism is to participate together with charged amino acid side chains in a proton-relay network, which facilitates proton transfer from the manganese cluster to the medium. The structural requirements likely to be involved may explain the sensitivity of oxygen evolution to Cl- depletion or other perturbations.									87	0	0	0	59	0	87			0006-2960			WOS:000181098800024	12590590

This is partly because of the limited synthesis strategies to modify the coordination environment of metal centers in SACs. Herein, we report a genetic strategy, transformation from thiometallate anions in the precursor to metal-sulfur bonding in carbon, producing hollow-sphere-structured Mo SAC with O/N/S co-coordination as an efficient ORR/OER dual-functional catalyst. The MoS42--doped polydopamine have O/S co-coordination for Mo, which converts into S/ O/N co-coordination in carbon during pyrolysis. We established that coordination engineering, specifically S coordination, could boost the ORR catalysis of Mo SAC. The low ORR half-wave potential (E-1/2) and small Tafel slope are among the best of Mo-based non-noble metal catalysts. The OER overpotential of 303 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) is significantly lower than that of commercial IrO2, and Pt/C. Assembled Zn-air batteries can work steadily for 90 h without significant voltage decay. Our strategy can be extended to the synthesis of other group-V and group-VI metal hollow SACs with an S coordination, such as W.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2405-8297			WOS:000805041500002

The materials crystallise from aqueous solution under alkali hydrothermal conditions with 10-40 nm crystallite size. Refinement of their crystal structures using both powder neutron and X-ray diffraction determined the composition of the materials, and Ir L-III-edge XANES spectroscopy shows the average Ir oxidation state to be close to 4.5 in all materials, consistent with bond valence sums. All materials show high electrocatalytic activity for the oxygen evolution reaction and the electrocatalyst which best maintains activity on cycling is the sodium-free Ca2-xIr2O6 center dot nH(2)O, while the (Na,Ca)(2-x)Ir2O6 center dot nH(2)O material shows highest activity when normalised for surface area. In membrane electrode assemblies, carbon corrosion is minimised, making the materials suitable for use in catalyst layers in proton exchange membrane devices, such as electrolysers and fuel cells. Under strongly acidic conditions it is proved that while A-site Ca and Na are readily leached, the average pyrochlore structure is maintained, as is electrocatalytic activity, with charge balance achieved by inclusion of protons in the pyrochlore structure in the form of bridging hydroxyls, as seen using inelastic neutron scattering spectroscopy.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000714403200001

Among the various OER catalysts, layered double hydroxides (LDHs) have attracted significant attention due to their compositional and structural flexibility, as well as tenability, and have been acknowledged as one of the most promising electrocatalysts. Nonetheless, OER possesses sluggish kinetics because it involves a four-electron pathway. Numerous efforts directed to tailoring the structure and composition of electrocatalysts have resulted in accelerated intrinsic catalytic activity and more exposed active sites, and subsequently advanced electrocatalytic performance. In this review, the recent progress of LDHs for the OER and the primary mechanisms for enhancing the electrocatalytic activity are presented. Besides, other tactics for promoting the catalytic performance, such as synthesis of LDH-based derivatives and configurations of heterostructures, are summarized, followed by a hypothesis on the enhanced OER activity. Finally, the applications of the OER, as well as the challenges in using LDHs are also discussed.									33	4	0	0	0	0	33			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000637033100001

Many types of such "metal-free" carbons have been synthesized by metal-involving methods, and it is urgent to confirm the origin of the catalytic performance. Herein, we verified that residual metals were inevitably present in these N-doped carbons and the catalytic performance for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) was due to the remaining metals, present at only a ppm level.									11	0	0	0	2	0	11			1359-7345	1364-548X		WOS:000363167900026	26355303

For example, by optimizing the strength of the Co-O bond, the ORR and OER activity of a typical perovskite oxide, LaCoO3, can be improved, but they are still unsatisfying. The insufficient insights into the effects of secondary metal dopants at the B-site on the electronic structure and activity, especially for ORR, significantly limit the R&D of bifunctional perovskite oxide catalysts. In this work, a series of LaMnxCo1-xO3 (x = 0, 0.25, 0.3, 0.35, 0.5, 1) catalysts are prepared by a polyol-assisted solvothermal method to investigate the structure-property relationships between the B-site metal substitution and the electrochemical performance of perovskite oxides catalysts. The optimized LaMn0.3Co0.7O3 catalyst demonstrates an enhanced half-wave potential of 0.72 V for ORR, 52 mV higher than that of the pristine LaCoO3 (0.668 V). Meanwhile, the OER overpotential of LaMn0.3Co0.7O3 catalyst is 416 mV, which is reduced by 64 mV compared to LaCoO3 (480 mV). It is revealed that the appropriate Mn dopant efficiently optimizes the covalency of Co-O bonds and significantly reduces the e(g) orbit-filling electron from 1.23 of pristine LaCoO3 to 1.02 in LaMn0.3Co0.7O3 (very close to theoretical value 1). This work paves a new way to design and synthesize bifunctional perovskite oxide electrocatalyst for ORR and OER.									38	4	0	0	2	0	40			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000538515700021	32369337

Here we present a novel primer-induced in situ hybridization method to covalently link the nickel-based two-dimensional (2D) ultrathin MOFs nanosheets and graphene. By considering the energetically favorable anchoring process, thermodynamically prohibited self polymerization side reaction and high delocalization of lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals (LUMO), the optimal phenylenebisboronic acid (PBA) primer were rapidly identified by screening thousands of primers via a high-throughput periodic density functional theory (DFT) workflow. Aided by the computational results, the PBA molecules were used to be covalently bonded to graphene successfully and then induce the in-situ growth of ultrathin Ni-MOFs nanosheets with terephthalic acid (TPA) as the ligand (denoted as Ni-HMOF@GE-PBA). The as-prepared Ni-HMOF@GE-PBA was demonstrated as a high-performance electrocatalyst for OER, delivering a much lower onset potential than that of simple blending of graphene and Ni-MOFs nanosheets by 150 mV. This design and construction strategy would pave an efficient pathway to rapid exploration and synthesis of new 2D-2D hybrid catalytic materials with excellent performance for OER.									9	1	0	0	1	0	10			2211-2855	2211-3282		WOS:000620324900001

However, the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), a half-reaction of water splitting, is so slow that various effective catalysts for the OER have been explored. In this study, we demonstrate a simple and direct process for the synthesis of OER-active NiFe catalysts over electrodes. A NiFe/C catalyst layer was formed on a glassy carbon electrode by simply dropping the catalyst ink containing only metal nitrates and carbon black. The catalyst layer exhibited higher OER performance than the state-of-the-art Ir/C catalyst. The presence of carbon black is essential to enhance the OER activity of NiFe because carbon black helps to disperse the NiFe active sites. Cyclic voltammetry indicated that Ni and Fe are adjacent to each other on the surface of carbon black, resulting in significantly higher activity of NiFe/C compared to those of Ni/C and Fe/C. The effects of the Ni/Fe ratio, amount of carbon black, and type of carbon black on the OER activity of NiFe/C were examined in detail. Furthermore, we discuss the factors that determine the OER performance of NiFe/C.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			0743-7463			WOS:000813224100001	35486135

Despite its very stable oxygen evolution reaction (OER) performance over large number of cycles, layered double perovskite PrBaCo2O5+ (PBC) has a rather limited surface area. It is, thus, desirable to have the stability of PBC combined with the higher OER activity obtained by enlarging its surface area. Here, we used micro-sized PBC particles as the substrate for the deposition of nano-sized nickel-iron hydroxide, Ni0.75Fe0.25(OH)(2), which led to an order of magnitude improvement in the OER current density at 1.63V versus the reversible hydrogen electrode for the amorphous Ni0.75Fe0.25(OH)(2)-decorated PBC catalyst (A-Ni0.75Fe0.25(OH)(2)+PBC), relative to the PBC catalyst. We showed that the crystal ordering of the decoration affects the OER activity, that is, the amorphous decoration provided a higher OER activity than the crystalline decoration by enabling a larger contact area between the catalyst and the aqueous electrolyte. The results we show here could potentially stimulate more innovative future works utilising simple chemical preparation route to realise high-performance hybrid OER catalysts involving novel constituents.									10	0	0	0	0	0	10			2196-0216			WOS:000397473700016

However, their surface compositional and morphological stability currently limits their long-term performance in real membrane electrode assemblies. Here, we perform in situ heating of compositionally segregated PtNi1.5 octahedral nanoparticles inside a transmission electron microscope, in order to study their compositional and morphological changes. The starting PtNi1.5 octahedra have Pt-rich edges and concave Ni-rich {111} facets. We reveal a morphological evolution sequence, which involves transformation from concave octahedra to particles with atomically flat {100} and {111} facets, ideally representing truncated octahedra or cuboctahedra. The flat {100} and {111} facets are thought to comprise a thin Pt layer with a Ni-rich subsurface, which may boost catalytic activity. However, the transformation to truncated octahedra/cuboctahedra also decreases the area of the highly active {111} facets. The morphological and surface compositional evolution, therefore, results in a compromise between catalytic activity and morphological stability. Our findings are important for the design of more stable faceted PtNi nanoparticles with high activities for the ORR.									41	7	0	0	6	0	44			1936-0851	1936-086X		WOS:000436910200025	29799722

In this work, a covalently coupled FeCo2O4/hollow reduced graphene oxide spheres (FCO/HrGOS) hybrid with a 3D architecture has been fabricated step by step via an electrostatically induced assembly method. The covalent coupling between FCO and HrGOS along with the 3D architecture of FCO/HrGOS not only provides an efficient electron transport path but also facilitate the transport of electrolyte and O-2 during the ORR and OER process in 0.1 M KOH aqueous solution. The ORR on FCO/HrGOS is mainly dominated by a 4e(-)reaction pathway. The as-prepared FCO/HrGOS exhibits comparable ORR activity and superior OER activity as compared to commercial Pt/C (20 wt.% Pt). Meanwhile, the stabilities of FCO/HrGOS toward both the ORR and OER are significantly higher than those of commercial Pt/C. The high electrocatalytic activity and durability of FCO/HrGOS hybrid are attributed to the covalent coupling between FCO and HrGOS as well as the 3D architecture of FCO/HrGOS built from the hollow graphene sphere.

Under these conditions, the photoinduced oxygen uptake did not exceed 10% of the total oxygen-evolving activity in PSII preparations. Both the Hill and the Mehler reactions were found to occur simultaneously under long-term illumination of PSII preparations with high-intensity light in the presence of potassium ferricyanide. During this light treatment in the presence of potassium ferricyanide, the rate of oxygen uptake increased gradually reaching 30% of the oxygen-evolving activity. The photogeneration of superoxide anion radical at increasing light intensities followed a typical light-response curve with a light saturation at 800 W/m(2). The results provide evidence that the Mehler reaction is the major source for superoxide and hydrogen peroxide in PSII preparations under photoinhibitory conditions and that the Mehler reaction in PSII proceeds more effectively at high light intensities. The relatively low and sustained rate of oxygen photoreduction in PSII preparations under photoinhibitory conditions substantiates the hypothesis on the involvement of Mehler reaction in cell signaling and regulation.									6	0	0	0	5	0	6			1021-4437	1608-3407		WOS:000233618200002

The assumed phase evolution processes were verified by the calculation of thermodynamics and the analysis of TG/DSC, XRD, UV-vis, EDS and XPS. The role of Na2CO3 in reaction was proved to be attributed to enhance the chemical potential of S via reacting to form Na2S2O3 and Na2S. The reaction processes were proved to be possible in thermodynamics. The flux Na2CO3 could generate oxygen vacancy due to the formation of . The band gap, lattice volume and oxygen 1s XPS spectra were investigated to explore the existence of oxygen vacancy. The oxygen vacancy enhanced the stability of Er2O2S crystal structure and could realize the synthesis at a higher temperature. Thus, Na2CO3 not only promoted the preferential formation of Er2O2S but also could effectively stabilize the hexagonal structure of Er2O2S. Meanwhile, compared with K2CO3, Er2O2S/ polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) coating exhibited a better absorbing property with Na2CO3 as flux.									5	0	0	0	1	0	5			0957-4522	1573-482X		WOS:000422993100080

The metal single-atom catalysts are required to be bifunctional with high efficient electrocatalytic activities for both oxygen reduction and evolution reactions (ORR and OER), and preferably non-noble. The supports, on the other hand, in addition to the requirements of being free-standing, flexible and porous, are required to strongly interact with the metal species to prevent their aggregation. However, satisfying these requirements simultaneously is yet challenging. Here, a free-standing 3D nanoporous holey graphene with both N and single-atom Mo dopants is prepared. The nanoholes are created by chemical vapor deposition method on nanoporous NiMo alloy templates with their surface decorated with catalytically inert SiO2 nanoparticles. The edge-rich graphene induced by the nanoholes facilitates the doping of pyridinic N and single-atom Mo in the fringe near the edges. The resulting N and Mo co-doped nanoporous holey graphene exhibits high bifunctional ORR and OER catalytic activities in alkaline electrolytes. The synergetic effects between N and Mo dopants are also revealed by density functional theory calculations. When incorporated in a solid-state zinc-air battery, the battery is bendable and can be continuously discharged/charged for 88 h with a high power density of 83 mW cm(-2). This work provides an efficient route to design metal single atom/cluster doped 3D freestanding nanoporous graphene as flexible electrodes.									51	5	0	0	2	0	52			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000549171400026

In the present work, the electrocatalytic activity towards oxygen evolution for a series of lanthanum-ruthenium compounds has been investigated by steady-state current-potential measurements in alkaline media to understand the effect of structure, valence state of the transition metal ion, and the role of surface adsorbed hydroxyl species. Compounds of the perovskite family, LaRuO3, La3.5Ru4O13, and La2RuO5, were prepared by the Pechini process and calcined at different temperatures to obtain the desired phases. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy of LaRuO3 and La2RuO5 showed shifts of the Ru-3d peaks towards higher binding energies indicative of a highly oxidized surface with possibly high surface hydroxylation. The electrochemical activity of the compounds at 0.8 V vs. NHE was in the order of 10(-6)A/cm(2) and the mass specific activity was about 80 mA/g. Tafel slopes were in the vicinity of 60 mV/decade for LaRuO3 (orthorhombic) and La3.5Ru4O13 (orthorhombic), and about 80 mV/decade for La2RuO5 (monoclinic). In addition FT-IR results indicate high surface coverage by hydroxide species. The reaction order with respect to OH- ions was found to be lower than unity. It is possible that strong interaction of hydroxide groups with ruthenium at the surface of the electrode makes it difficult to dissociate the Ru-OH bond and prevent further interaction with dissolved OH- even at high overpotentials.

The development of earth-abundant electrocatalysts toward direct seawater splitting has emerged as a promising strategy. Highly efficient electrocatalysts with improved selectivity and stability are of significance in preventing the interference of side reactions and resisting various impurities. This review first discusses the macroscopic understanding of direct seawater electrolysis and then focuses on the strategies for rational design of electrocatalysts toward direct seawater splitting. The perspectives of improved electrocatalysts to solve emerging challenges and further development of direct seawater splitting are also provided.									9	0	0	0	1	0	9			2095-0179	2095-0187		WOS:000710607400001

Here we report a facile one-pot hydrothermal assembly of three-dimensional (3D) reduced graphene oxide (RGO)-Ni-Fe oxide hybrid foams as an effective electrocatalyst for oxygen evolution reaction (OER). It was found that in the one-step hydrothermal process, only in a narrow pH range around 3.5, the 3D RGO foam can be formed with non-precious nickel-iron oxide nanoparticles (< 5 nm) embedded in the porous structure of the foam. The as-prepared 3D structured RGO foams provide an effective network for electron transfer, massive pore structures for ion transport, and large surface areas for reaction. The electrochemical properties of RGO-Ni-Fe foams were investigated by using a three-electrode system under alkaline conditions, with the OER properties comparable to those of iridium catalyst and other superior Ni-Fe catalysts.

In this work, an urchin-like oxygen-doped MoS2/ZnIn2S4 (OMS/ZIS) composite was fabricated for the first time using a simple solvothermal method. The unique microstructure with abundant active sites and fast charge transfer channels further shortened the charge migration distance and compressed carrier recombination. The obtained composite exhibited an efficient H-2 evolution reaction rate of 12.8 mmol/g/h under visible light, which was nearly times higher than pristine ZnIn2S4, and the apparent quantum efficiency was 14.9% (420 nm). The results of the simultaneous photocatalytic H-2 evolution and organic pollutant decomposition test were satisfactory, resulting in decomposition efficiencies of resorcinol, tetracycline, and bisphenol A that reached 41.5%, 63.5%, and 53.0% after 4 h, respectively, and the highest H-2 evolution rate was 672.7 mu mol/g/h for bisphenol A. Furthermore, natural organic matter (NOM) abundantly found in actual water was adopted as an electron donor for H production under simulated sunlight irradiation, indicating the promising practicability of simultaneous hydrogen evolution and NOM decomposition. Moreover, the mechanisms of the dual-purpose photocatalytic reactions, as well as the synergistic effect between the molecular structures of the organic pollutants and the corresponding adsorption behavior on the photocatalyst surface were illustrated in detail. These obtained results may serve as an inspiration for the rational design of highly efficient, dual-functional photocatalysts in the future.

Here, porous nanowire arrays composed of Co3O4 nanoparticles and carbon species are prepared by a facile carbonization of the metal-organic framework materials of ZIF-67 which directly grow on Ni foam. The obtained hybrid materials possess a large surface area of 345 m(2) g(-1) and a high carbon content. The hierarchically interconnected nanowire arrays with porous structure strongly immobilized on Ni foam facilitate the diffusion of generated gas, shorten electrolyte diffusion distance, and enhance charge transport. As the working electrode for oxygen evolution reaction without any extra modification in 1.0 M KOH, it can provide a stable current density of 10 mA cm-(2) at 1.54 V (vs RHE), along with robust durability. Additionally, the Co3O4-C hybrid materials worked as oxygen reduction catalyst exhibit a positive onset potential of 0.91 V, large limiting current density, and excellent stability. When used as the air catalysts for primary Zn-air batteries, the assembled batteries deliver a large peak power density of 118 mW cm-(2) and excellent operation stability. A variety of characterization results and controlled experiments demonstrate that the efficient performance of this hybrid material toward electrocatalytic reactions originates from the unique electrode configuration, intimate distribution of active species, hierarchically porous configuration, high conductivity of Ni foam, and synergistic effect of Co3O4 and carbonaceous materials.									73	12	0	0	0	0	74			2168-0485			WOS:000419536800075

Thus, they offer an economical alternative to expensive conventional platinum- or iridium-based OER catalysts and could provide a crucial step towards a hydrogen-based energy economy. These favorable properties are presumably due to a synergistic effect between Fe and Ni. However, these synergistic effects strongly depend on the local structure of the catalyst and their origin - and its relation to the local structure - are still not fully understood. In this work we present a study of the thermal annealing induced structural evolution of amorphous (Ni,Fe)O-x thin films, and correlate this evolution to their OER catalytic capabilities. Samples are X-ray amorphous at low annealing temperatures. However, analysis of the X-ray absorption spectra reveals local structural transitions in all samples - before the onset of crystallization - providing evidence of polyamorphism. Transitions of the local Ni and Fe environments occur at distinctly different temperatures and coincide with a stepwise increase in the catalytic activation potential (OER thermodynamics) and the Tafel slope (OER kinetics), respectively. We previously have attributed the increase in onset potential to a change in active site in NiOx at the phase transition temperature; considering that the mixed metal oxides' onset potentials exhibit the same behavior with annealing temperature (T-anneal), we conclude that the potential-determining OER reaction step must occur at a Ni site. Similarly, the reaction kinetics change at the same annealing temperature as the local Fe environment; we thus infer that the rate-determining step occurs at a Fe site. To reconcile these observations we put forward a dual-site OER reaction mechanism with potential- and rate-determining steps happening at Ni and Fe sites, respectively. This synergistic effect is ultimately responsible for the superior OER performance of many (Ni,Fe)O-x catalysts. At higher annealing temperatures, the synergistic effect is suppressed, possibly by phase separation into NiOx and FeOx phases, as suggested by our X-ray diffraction results.									12	0	0	0	1	0	12			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000655655600001

The device is introduced so as to raise the cathode potential which changes the reaction products qualitatively. It is discussed that the balance between cathode and anode reactions is essential to take the advantage of introduced device. We succeed in stoichiometric evaluation of oxygen evolution on the surface of GaN photo-electrode. When the reaction condition is optimized, we can realize the raised cathode potential, in which the chief reaction product of CO2 reduction changes from formic acid to hydrocarbons, such as methane (CH4) and ethylene (C2H4).

Although sulfide ion of catalyst negatively shifts the valence band-edge relative to its oxide ion, the instability of sulfide ions during H2O oxidation is a critical obstacle to simultaneous evolution of H-2 and O-2. Here, active, stable, and spherical nanoflower-like bimetal (Mo,Ni)(S,O)(3-x) sulfo-oxide catalysts with a band gap of similar to 2.1 eV and different concentrations of oxygen vacancy defects were synthesized for H2O splitting. (Mo,Ni)(S,O)(3-x) of 25 mg with a suitable amount of oxygen vacancy defects could evolve 587.5 mu mol/h H-2 under visible-light irradiation. This work demonstrated an example of converting an oxidation photocatalyst into a reduction one. Microstructure analysis showed that surface oxygen vacancy defects and the multiple-valence charges in Ni and Mo not only promoted effective separation, interface transfer, and reactions of photo-carriers but also reduced the charge build-up to avoid photo-corrosion during photocatalytic water decomposition.									16	0	0	0	0	0	16			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000627382200001

Here, a multiscale structure-engineering approach to construct iron (Fe) doped cobalt monophosphide (CoP) hybrids for efficient electrocatalysis of water splitting is reported. A two-step method is developed to synthesize CoP nanosheets with uniform Fe doping and hybridization with carbon nanotubes (CNTs). The nanostructuring, uniform doping, and hybridization with CNT afford efficient electrocatalysts comparable to Pt/ C for hydrogen evolution reactions in acidic, neutral, and alkaline electrolytes. It is found that the Fe doping level has different effects on catalytic activities in different electrolytes. Furthermore, after in situ oxidization/hydrolysis of the phosphides to corresponding oxyhydroxides, the hybrid electrocatalysts exhibit better performances than the benchmark commercial Ir/ C for catalyzing the oxygen evolution reaction. A two-electrode alkaline water electrolyzer constructed with these hybrid electrocatalysts can afford a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at a voltage of 1.5 V.									232	15	0	0	10	0	232			1616-301X	1616-3028		WOS:000404019400004

Herein, a surface lanthanum-deficient (SLD) iridium oxide as a highly efficient OER electrocatalyst is reported (labeled as La3IrO7-SLD), which is obtained by electrochemical activation, and shows better activity and durability than that of commerically available IrO2 as well as most of the reported Ir-based OER electrocatalysts. At a current density of 10 mA cm(-2), the overpotential of La3IrO7-SLD is 296 mV, which is lower than that of IrO2 (316 mV). Impressively, the increase of potential is less than 50 mV at a voltage-time chronopotentiometry extending for 60 000 s using a glass carbon electrode that is vastly superior to IrO2. Moreover, the mass activity of the catalyst is approximately five times higher than that of IrO2 at 1.60 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode. Density functional theory calculations suggest that a lattice oxygen participating mechanism with central Ir atoms serving as active sites (LOM-Ir) rationalizes the high activity and durability for the La3IrO7-SLD electrocatalyst. The favorable energy level of surface active Ir 5d orbitals relative to coordinated O 2p orbitals makes the La3IrO7-SLD more active.									15	0	0	0	2	0	15			1614-6832	1614-6840		WOS:000602550600001

Importantly, it was confirmed that the electrochemical deposition method could be applied to nickel foam substrates for use in zero-gap alkaline water electrolysis cells. The oxide layers produced were then investigated for their activity towards the oxygen evolution reaction in 30 wt % KOH solution and found to be superior compared with the uncoated nickel substrate. Layers produced by both methods had similar electrochemical behaviour, provided that the layers were annealed at temperatures a parts per thousand yen350 C-a similar to. This thermal treatment was required to mechanically stabilise the electrochemically deposited cobalt oxide layer. Due to this finding, the effect of annealing temperature was investigated for the electrochemically deposited layer, and it was found that the overpotential for oxygen evolution increased with increasing annealing temperature. Using cyclic voltammetry and impedance spectroscopy, it is concluded that the decrease in performance with increasing annealing temperature is largely caused by the corresponding decrease in active surface area. However, for annealing temperatures a parts per thousand yen400 C-a similar to, additional resistances are introduced that cause lower performance. The impedance data suggest that these additional resistances are caused by either a decrease in the conductivity of the cobalt oxide layer itself, or the formation of a passivating-like nickel oxide layer between the active cobalt oxide and the nickel substrate, or both. The resistances' dependence on potential suggests that they originate from a semi-conducting material and these additional resistances ultimately give rise to non-linear Tafel behaviour.									11	0	0	0	0	0	11			1868-2529	1868-5994		WOS:000339736500015

Here, we adopt a simple annealing strategy to embed atomic cobalt into nitrogen-doped graphene for efficient catalysis of HER and ORR The as-prepared catalyst shows high activity and durability for HER with a low overpotential of 182 and 172 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) in 0.5 M H2SO4 and 0.1 M KOH, respectively. In addition, it also exhibits excellent ORR performance in both alkaline and acid electrolytes, including a positive onset potential (0.97 V versus 0.79 V) and half-wave potential (0.87 V versus 0.69 V), and a low Tafel slope (46.1 mV.dec(-1) versus 48.2 mV.dec(-1)). Meanwhile, it manifests remarkable electrochemical stability, and strong tolerance to methanol crossover. The atomic cobalt coordinated with several nitrogen atoms should be the active centers for HER and ORR. The good stability of electrochemical HER and ORR should be attributed to the stable Co-N-x moieties and the strong interaction between the Co-N-x and the graphene support. Our work provides a facile strategy for developing high-efficiency and durable HER and ORR electrocatalysts.									43	2	0	0	1	0	43			2168-0485			WOS:000469304900021

However, there are few reports on deliberately tailoring catalyst structure except for the hierarchical pores formed from Zn evaporation during the pyrolysis. Herein, NaCl salt-assisted carbonization and unfolding of Fe, Co-codoped ZIF-8 polyhedron (FeCo/ZIF-8) result in ultra-thin Fe, Co, N-codoped graphite flake (FeCo/NG), while FeCo/ZIF-8 pyrolysis without NaCl yields Fe, Co, N-codoped carbon spheres (FeCo/NC). Because of the high specific surface area, porosity, and degree of defects, the active site is further exposed. The synthesized FeCo/NG demonstrates excellent oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) properties with half-wave potential (E-1/2) at 0.88 V and overpotential at 460 mV and good cycling stability, superior to those of FeCo/NC. In addition, the assembled Zn-air batteries with FeCo/NG catalysts deliver high peak power density at 109 mW cm(-2), specific capacity at 783 mAh g(-1) and an operating time for 100 h. The study will provide a feasible synthesis method to design high-performance electrocatalysts by deliberate tailoring structures with molten salt-assisted carbonization and unfolding of ZIFs.

The potential of this new approach is highlighted by the following results. i) The tantalum oxyfluorides Ta3O7F and TaO2F are obtained from plastic scrap without using toxic or caustic chemicals for fluorination. ii) Short reaction times (minutes rather than days) reduce the process time the energy costs by almost three orders of magnitude. iii) The oxyfluorides Ta3O7F and TaO2F are produced in gram amounts of nanoparticles. Their synthesis can be upscaled to the kg range with industrial sintering equipment. iv) SPS processing changes the catalytic properties: while conventionally prepared Ta3O7F and TaO2F show little catalytic activity, SPS-prepared Ta3O7F and TaO2F exhibit high activity for photocatalytic oxygen evolution, reaching photoconversion efficiencies up to 24.7% and applied bias to photoconversion values of 0.86%.

The prepared CuWO4@rGO nanocomposites show bifunctional electro-chemical performances for the HER and OER via water splitting reactions in alkaline (0.5 M KOH) and acidic (0.5 M H2SO4) media. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) and linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) reveal superlative HER and OER performances of the CuWO4@rGO nanocomposites. The onset over-potentials of the CuWO4@rGO nanocomposites were found to be similar to 270 and similar to 330 mV for the OER in 0.5 M KOH and 0.5 M H2SO4, respectively, while the onset potentials were found to be similar to 180 and similar to 135 mV for the HER in 0.5 M KOH and 0.5 M H2SO4, respectively. The CuWO4@rGO nanocomposites also showed lower Tafel slopes of similar to 110 and similar to 315 mV dec(-1) for the OER in 0.5 M KOH and 0.5 M H2SO4, respectively, while the Tafel slopes of the CuWO4@rGO nanocomposites were found to be similar to 192 and similar to 212 mV dec(-1) for the HER in 0.5 M KOH and 0.5 M H2SO4, respectively. Hence, the small energy loss of low-cost electro-catalysts during electro-chemical water splitting reactions reveals comparable HER/OER performances with noble electro-catalysts.									6	0	0	0	1	0	6			1144-0546	1369-9261		WOS:000732838500001

The performances of the CoPS@C electrode as a non-noble metal electrocatalyst for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) show good activity. On the other hand, the electrochemical investigation of CoPS systems for lithium ion batteries (LIBs) is reported for the first time. The CoPS@C nanocomposite as a novel anode can maintain a capacity of about 713mA h g(-1) after 50 cycles at a current density of 0.2 A g(-1), indicating its potential applications in lithium storage. Test results also demonstrate that the CoPS@C nanocomposite exhibit more excellent HER, OER and Li storage performances compared to the bulk CoPS sample.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6				2046-2069		WOS:000468641300034	35516335

Here, we presented Mo-doped Co3O4 nanoparticles-coated carbon nanotubes (Mo-Co3O4/CNTs), which were fabricated through pyrolysis of CNTs-stringed ZIF-67 with the doping of phosphomolybdic acid. The as-prepared Mo-Co3O4/CNTs exhibits high OER activity and strong durability with the onset potential of 1.42 V and almost constant low overpotential of 280 mV at 10 mA cm(-2), which outcompete the benchmark IrO2 electrocatalyst. The outstanding OER performance is mainly attributed that Mo doping modulates the electronic properties and structures of Co3O4, which bring out high proportion of Co2+ active sites, large specific surface area, more electrophilic Co ions and favorable interfacial charge transfer. This work highlights the modification effects of high-valence metal ions on the structures of the electrocatalysts for improving OER performance.									26	0	0	0	3	0	26			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000613252200002		
J	Sung, Moonchang; Kim, Jongwon					Kim, Jongwon/0000-0001-8208-8568			Oxygen evolution reaction on Pt sphere and Ir-modified Pt sphere electrodes with porous structures								INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY				43	4			2130	2138		10.1016/j.ijhydene.2017.11.167				JAN 25 2018	2018	Oxygen evolution reactions (OER) have received recent attention because of their importance in electrochemical water splitting for sustainable energy sources. Here, the electrochemical OER activity on electrodeposited Pt sphere electrodes with porous structures was investigated. The dependence of the OER activity on the porosity of the Pt sphere electrodes was systemically examined by changing the charge during the electrodeposition of the Pt spheres. Significantly enhanced OER activities were observed on the porous Pt sphere electrodes compared to that on a flat Pt electrode, and the activity increased as the porosity of the Pt sphere increased. Pt spheres with rough nanoscale surface features exhibited greater OER activities than the smooth Pt sphere electrodes. The surfaces of the Pt sphere electrodes were modified with Ir by spontaneous replacement reactions, which resulted in an OER activity enhancement relative to the Pt sphere electrodes. The OER activity of Pt electrodes depending on the porosity and surface roughness demonstrated in this work gives insight into the fabrication of efficient OER electrocatalysts.

Here, we demonstrate that this intriguing high activity is owing to the high concentration of Ni cationic vacancy on the nascent ultra-small NiOOH particles (<3 nm). By using first-principles calculations, we compute the thermodynamics of Ni dissolution and clarify the mechanism of oxygen evolution reaction (OER) on the gamma-NiOOH surface. We show that (i) similar to 4% Ni cations on the surface of gamma-NiOOH dissolve at pH = 7 and 1.73 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode; (ii) on the pristine gamma-NiOOH surface, OER proceeds via the "lattice peroxide" mechanism (*H2O -> *OH -> *O-(OH)-H-latt* -> O-O-latt -> O-2) with an overpotential of 0.70 V; (iii) in the presence of Ni cationic vacancies, OER proceeds via the "hydroperoxide" mechanism (*OH + *H2O -> *2OH -> *OOH -> O-2) with an overpotential of 0.40 V. Our electronic structure and geometrical structure analyses demonstrate that the structural flexibility at the four-coordinated Ni site nearby Ni vacancy, featuring the ability to bind two terminal oxo species, is key to boost the activity. Considering the presence of the active OOH intermediate, our theory thus implies that the ultra-small oxide nanoclusters with ample cation vacancies could be a paradigm in catalyst design for oxidation reactions.									35	1	0	0	2	0	35			2155-5435			WOS:000516887400019

This report shows how a hybrid NF@CGO with a catalytic layer codoped by nickel crystals, cobalt tetroxide (Co3O4), graphene oxide (GO), and in-situ-generated Ni(OH)(2)/NiOOH, via codeposition in combination with in situ electrochemical activation, acts as a promising OEE for alkaline water electrolysis. Notably, this hybrid catalyst shows excellent electrocatalytic performance toward OER in 1.0 M KOH with 212 mV low overpotentials to achieve a catalytic current density of 10 mA cm(-2), which is comparable to the state-of-the-art noble catalysts. The NF@CGO as an electrocatalytically active and robust OER electrode also exhibits strong long-term electrochemical durability with release of a large current density of 800 mA cm(-2) at 350 mV without degradation after 100 h. Such a remarkable performance can benefit from the self-assembly of the introduced OER catalysts deposited on NF, in-situ-generated Ni(OH)(2)/NiOOH nanoflakes, and their synergistic effects. Collectively, so far, the hybrid NF@CGO is one of the most efficient OEEs in alkaline electrolytes, which could potentially be implemented in large-scale water electrolysis systems.									9	0	0	0	0	0	9			2574-0962			WOS:000504953500052

Herein, how to use self-reconstruction as an efficient strategy to develop novel and robust OER catalysts by designing pre-catalysts with flexible components susceptible to OER conditions is proposed. The NiFe-based layered double hydroxides (LDHs) intercalated with resoluble molybdate (MoO42-) anions in interlayers are constructed and then demonstrated to achieve complete electrochemical self-reconstruction (ECSR) into active NiFe-oxyhydroxides (NiFeOOH) beneficial to alkaline OER. Various ex situ and in situ techniques are used to capture structural evolution process including fast dissolution of MoO42- and deep reconstruction to NiFeOOH upon simultaneous hydroxyl invasion and electro-oxidation. The obtained NiFeOOH exhibits an excellent OER performance with an overpotential of only 268 mV at 50 mA cm(-1) and robust durability over 45 h, much superior to NiFe-LDH and commercial IrO2 benchmark. This work suggests that the ECSR engineering in component-flexible precursors is a promising strategy to develop highly active OER catalysts for energy conversion.									10	0	0	0	0	0	10			1613-6810	1613-6829		WOS:000680535400001	34342939

Single crystal XRD, IR and elemental analysis confirmed the formation of compound (1). Morphology and thermal stability were evaluated by SEM and TG respectively. Electrochemical studies were carried out in a three-electrode system using 1 coated FTO as a working electrode using 0.1 M KOH solution. The electrochemical investigation showed that 1 produced a current density of 10 mAcm(-2) at a relatively low overpotential (eta = 404 mV) while a maximum current density of 62 mAcm(-2) was achieved. A catalytic onset potential for OER was observed at 1.5 V (vs RHE) and needed overpotential of 258 mV. The catalyst offered a turnover frequency (TOF) of 0.06 s(-1) for OER at 404 mV. Long-term stability measurements of 1 were recorded by using chronoamperometry, IR analysis and LS voltammograms for the pristine and post-catalytic 1 coated FTO electrodes that confirmed the durability of the catalyst. The fascinating electrochemical behaviour of 1 toward oxygen evolution reaction can be attributed to its 3D polymeric structure and represents 1 as a robust and efficient catalyst towards OER.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0020-1693	1873-3255		WOS:000588151400013

The faradaic selectivity for the oxygen evolution is around 70% and takes place on the side-wall (e.g. 110) planes of the NRs, while H2O2 is produced on the (001) polar planes, which appear to be 3-4 times more reactive than the side-wall (110) planes. By the use and the kinetic analysis of potentiodynamic experiments it has been inferred that the OER mechanism involves two active sites on the (110) surface: (I) the surface Zn atoms where OH- are being discharged and adsorbed electrochemically OHadZn and (II) the photo-induced oxygen vacancies where the former species migrate and are adsorbed as OHadV and evolved as O-2 under the effect of incident radiation. The transient kinetic analysis of the potentiodynamic measurements resulted in the determination of the electrokinetic parameters (Tafel slope (b), symmetry factors (beta) and exchange current densities (I-o)) of the OHadZn and OHadV species, thus providing significant insight as of their binding energies and their reactivity on the ZnO surface. The turnover frequency at the maximum of the applied bias photoconversion efficiency (ABPE) for the production of one molecule of O-2 is 0.35 s(-1). (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Herein, natural cellulose nanofibrils (CNFs) with abundant carboxyls and hydroxyls were employed to tailor NiFe catalysts (NiFeNSC) for the efficient oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Benefiting from the introduction of CNF, the NiFe metal ions were homogeneously dispersed on the CNF surface and exhibited a smaller particle size. Additionally, the surface area was 3.17 times larger and the surface wettability was significantly improved. By integrating the active NiFe nanoparticles with doped CNF, the overpotential of synthesized NiFeNSC catalyst was decreased from 370 mV to 244 mV to deliver a current density of 10 mA cm(-2), and exhibited a small Tafel slope of 43.3 mV dec(-1) in 1.0 M KOH electrolyte. Impressively, the NiFeNSC displayed excellent long-term stability, which was only 38 mV increased over 24 h chronopotentiometry measurement, outperforming the catalyst without CNF (NiFeNS) and commercial RuO2 catalyst remarkably. The present results demonstrate a new avenue for designing resource abundant and sustainable electrocatalysts, providing a novel strategy to replace the fossil-involved nanocarbon.									6	0	0	0	1	0	6			2196-0216			WOS:000475512500011

In particular methanol, formic acid, ferrous to ferric and hydrogen oxidation as anodic reactions are examined. There remain several important materials, engineering, and process challenges associated with the new approaches which are reviewed in this article.

Here we report a one-step approach to grow highly porous S-doped Ni/Fe (oxy)hydroxide catalysts on Ni foam in several minutes under room temperature. This ultrafast method effectively engineers the surface of Ni foam into a rough S-doped Ni/Fe (oxy)hydroxide layer, which has multiple levels of porosity and good hydrophilic features and exhibits extraordinary oxygen evolution reaction (OER) performance in both alkaline salty water and seawater electrolytes. Specifically, the S-doped Ni/Fe (oxy)hydroxide catalyst requires low overpotentials of 300 and 398 mV to deliver current densities of 100 and 500 mA cm(-2), respectively, when directly used as an OER catalyst in alkaline natural seawater electrolyte. Using this OER catalyst together with an efficient hydrogen evolution reaction catalyst, we have achieved the commercially demanded current densities of 500 and 1000 mA cm(-2) at low voltages of 1.837 and 1.951 V, respectively, for overall alkaline seawater electrolysis at room temperature with very good durability. This work affords a cost-efficient surface engineering method to steer commercial Ni foam into robust OER catalysts for seawater electrolysis, which has important implications for both the hydrogen economy and environmental remediation.									210	11	0	0	6	0	213			1754-5692	1754-5706		WOS:000579868500036

In this work, magnetic field was applied during electrodeposition for the preparation of AuPt particles. With the increase of the magnetic flux density under constant current density, the grain size decreases from similar to 1 mu m to 200 nm and the activity of the AuPt catalyst increases. The magnetic field orienting vertically to the electric field has a promotion effect on increasing the catalytic ability of AuPt/carbon electrode. By pulse plating, the grain size decreases to about 100 nm. By adjusting parameters of the electric field and the magnetic field, controllable in situ preparation of AuPt catalyst with various morphology and catalytic activity can be achieved.									1	3	1	0	0	0	4			1674-0068	1003-7713		WOS:000348272400014

Hydrogen evolution behavior is included by potentiostatic method. It is found that volume of hydrogen evolution goes up linearly at the first stage and then increases slowly at different polarization potential, concentration of sulfuric acid and V3+. The reason is adsorption hydrogen on graphite surface, with a trend toward an increase in electrical resistance and a decrease in the active surface area. The surface morphology and structural properties of graphite are investigated by scanning electron microscope (SEM) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The electrochemical performance of graphite is observed using cyclic voltammetry and impedance spectroscopy (EIS). It is shown that hydrogen evolution reaction changes surface morphology and introduces some defect sites on the surface of graphite. The electrochemical activity of graphite towards V3+/V2+ couple becomes less easily after hydrogen evolution treatment.									52	3	0	0	4	2	53			1452-3981			WOS:000304413000082

Despite enormous efforts, the design and development of OER catalysts with high catalytic activities under neutral conditions are highly desired but still remain a great challenge. Herein, we report a room temperature chemical route to prepare xceria/cobalt borate (xCeO(2)/Co-Bi) hybrids as efficient OER catalysts by tuning the molar ratio of Ce/Co (x represents the amount of CeO2). The optimised catalyst (20CeO(2)/Co-Bi hybrid) was found to exhibit remarkable OER catalytic activity with an overpotential of 453 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2), Tafel slope of 120 mV dec(-1) and long-term stability in neutral medium due to its good conductivity, mass transportation and strong synergetic coupling effects, showing the potential of Co-based electrochemical materials for practical application in energy storage devices.									6	0	0	0	1	0	6			2516-0230			WOS:000486249800037	36133558

However, it is always a challenge to explore a stable bifunctional catalyst. Here, WO3-anchored ZIF-67-derived CoO@graphitized carbon is wrapped by a thin carbon-layer to obtain CoO@GC/WO3@CL catalysts. The well-crystallized WO3 nanospheres are evolved from WO3 microrods via an intra-particle maturation. For ORR, the peak-potential of CoO@GC/WO3@CL-800 (800 ?) (0.81 V vs. RHE) is higher than that of Pt/C (0.79 V). Synergies between WO3 (oxygen vacancies) and CoO (Co2+) improve mass/charge transfer to boost the 4e(-) pathway. For OER, CoO@GC/WO3@CL-800 has a lower overpotential (330 mV) than RuO2 (490 mV) at 10 mA cm(-2). The O-2 evolution rate can reach 0.125 mmol s(-1) with a high Faraday efficiency of 96.7 %. Cooperation between CoOOH and oxygen vacancies promotes the H2O-oxidation to boost the O-2-generation. A relatively low delta E [E-j=10(OER)-E-1/2(ORR)] of 0.72 V confirms the highly-stable ORR/OER activities of CoO@GC/WO3@CL-800, which obtains a higher power density (138 mW cm(-2)) than Pt/C + RuO2 cathode in primary ZABs. This study indicates a new direction to build a multilayer-structured ORR/OER catalyst by using ZIFs as templates.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000848109300004

A Ni-Fe MOF with 2,5-dihydroxy terephthalate as a linker has been claimed to be among the mostefficient catalysts for the oxygen-evolution reaction (OER) under alkalineconditions. Herein, the MOF stability under the OER was reinvestigated byelectrochemical methods, X-ray diffraction, X-ray absorption spectroscopy, energy-dispersive spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmissionelectron microscopy, nuclear magnetic resonance, operando visible spectroscopy,electrospray ionization mass spectroscopy, and Raman spectroscopy. The peakscorresponding to the carboxylate group are observed at 1420 and 1520 cm-1usingRaman spectroscopy. The peaks disappear after the reaction, suggesting theremoval of the carboxylate group. A drop in carbon content but growth in oxygencontent after the OER was detected by energy-dispersive spectra. This shows thatafter the OER, the surface of MOF is oxidized. SEM images also show deep restructures in the surface morphology of this Ni-FeMOF after the OER. Nuclear magnetic resonance and electrospray ionization mass spectrometry show the decomposition of thelinker in alkaline conditions and even in the absence of potential. These experimental data indicate that during the OER, thesynthesized MOF transforms to a Fe-Ni-layered double hydroxide, and the formed metal oxide is a candidate for the OER catalysis.Generalization is not true; however, taken together, thesefindings suggest that the stability of Ni-Fe MOFs under harsh oxidationconditions should be reconsidered.									8	0	0	0	0	0	8			0020-1669	1520-510X		WOS:000779822100032	35297622

The electrocatalysts based on multi-component and hierarchically structured non-noble metal hydr(oxy)oxide materials are of great prospects. Herein, we report an efficient strategy at low temperatures for synthesizing amorphous iron-doped cobalt-molybdenum ultrathin hydroxide (Fe-CoMo UH) nanosheets. Benefiting from the ultrathin amorphous structure and multi-metal coordination, Fe-CoMo UH nanosheets exhibit outstanding performance for OERs with a low overpotential of 245 mV at 10 mA cm(-2), a small Tafel slope of 37 mV dec(-1) and an excellent stability for 90 h. The mass activity of Fe-CoMo UH is higher than that of commercial Ir/C and most of the transition metal hydroxide catalysts. This work provides a feasible consideration for the construction of promising efficient non-noble metal catalysts.									9	1	0	0	0	0	9			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000617768200041	33527975

However, the energy transfer mechanism between the plasmonic core and the catalytic shell as well as the functional mechanism of plasmon in the OER reactions is still unclear. Here, we designed core-shell Au@Ni3S2 and yolk-shell Au-Ni3S2 with well-controlled morphology. We directly mapped the distribution of plasmon using monochromatic low-loss electron energy loss spectroscopy. The structural pore in the yolk-shell Au-Ni3S2 greatly changes the dielectric environment and significantly enhances absorption of incoming light. The incoming photoenergy was dominantly dissipated on the shell by forming electron-hole pairs, leading to a higher energy flow rate for OER reactions. The catalytic activity of yolk-shell Au-Ni3S2 achieved nearly sixfold of core-shell Au@Ni3S2 and over 80-fold of pure Ni3S2 under illumination. Our results suggest that delicate microstructural control of catalysts can be used as an effective approach to design more efficient catalysts.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			0003-6951	1077-3118		WOS:000484671000015

Rather than those popular extrinsic modulations of any catalysts with gradually degraded performance, we aim at the utilization of the intermediates offered from the undergoing OER as long-standing electrocatalysts. Herein, by inverted design, we extracted the bimetallic borides (FeCoB2)-derived intermediates metal borates in the OER, unlocking their potential as a selffunctionalized highly active catalytic phase in-situ formed on the metal boride surface for continuing OER operation. Mechanistically, the surface metal atoms are oxidized to oxyhydroxides, and the surface metalloids (B) are further transformed to the corresponding oxoanions to form metal borates. Such OER self-produced electrocatalyst exhibits a small overpotential of 295 mV at 10 mA/cm2 and its high catalytic activity lasts even after 200 h. Compared with FeCoB2, the catalytic activity of this electrochemically activated FeCoB2 is -7 times higher. The in-situ formed metal borate is dominatingly responsible for the obtained high catalytic activity. Such unique OER-produced self-functionalization surfaces of metal borates afford to greatly reduce the energy barrier of the continuing OER, thereby accelerating the reaction process.

The Tafel slope of PMFMO@RGONF nanocomposite is about 107 mV dec(-1) in the 0.50 mol (L-1) H2SO4 solution and suggests the Volmer-Heyrovsky mechanism for HER. The results show that this electrocatalyst has an excellent stability (at least 10000 cycles) in the sulfuric acid solution. Hence, The LSV curve shows that the Pt(20%)/C has a better onset-potential than present electrocatalyst for HER but PMFMO@RGONF nanocomposite produces current density (j) of 300 mAcm(-2) at overpotential (eta) of -721 mV (eta 300 = -721 mV(vs. Ag/AgCI)) which is smaller than Pt(20%)/C (eta 300 = -802 mV). The PMFMO@RGONF nanocomposite as an electrocatalyst follows four electrons mechanism for ORR in 0.10 mol L-1 KOH. As an important result, after addition of methanol into the electrolyte, this electrocatalyst is stable for a long time (at least 10000s) while the catalytic activity of Pt (20%)/C is quickly lost in the presence of methanol.

Here we examine the RuO2 OER kinetics on rutile (110), (100), (101), and (111) orientations, finding (100) the most active. We assess the potential involvement of lattice oxygen in the OER mechanism with online electrochemical mass spectrometry, which showed no evidence of oxygen exchange on these oriented facets in acidic or basic electrolytes. Similar results were obtained for polyoriented RuO2 films and particles, in contrast to previous work, suggesting lattice oxygen is not exchanged in catalyzing OER on crystalline RuO2 surfaces. This hypothesis is supported by the correlation of activity with the number of active Ru-sites calculated by density functional theory, where more active facets bind oxygen more weakly. This new understanding of the active sites provides a design strategy to enhance the OER activity of RuO2 nanoparticles by facet engineering.									184	2	0	0	9	0	185			2380-8195			WOS:000399636600022

Such catalysts can take the mutual benefits of the core, i.e., high activity, and the shell, i.e., high stability. However, the understanding about how the core affects the electrocatalytic performance of the shell is still not clear. In this study, we performed a systematic study of hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) catalytic activities of different noble-metal phosphide-based core-shell nanostructured hybrids (noble-metal phosphides nanoparticles wrapped by ultrathin N, P codoped graphitic carbon (NPGC) shells, MPx@NPGC, MPx = RhP2, RuP2, PtP2, IrP2, and Pd5P2) in both acidic and alkaline aqueous solutions for the first time. Among them, RhP2@NPGC core-shell nanostructure exhibited the highest HER activity in 0.5 M H2SO4, while the RuP2@NPGC composite was the best one in 1 M KOH. Taking microstructure into account, it is obvious that the catalytic behavior of the MPx@NPGC category was largely attributed to the different noble-metal phosphide cores. The ECSA normalized activity further revealed the RhP2@NPGC and RuP2@NPGC hybrids are the most active HER catalysts in acidic and alkaline electrolytes, respectively, along with fastest charge transfer and surface reaction rates during the HER process. This study provides useful guidelines in the further development of high-performance core-shell structured electrocatalysts for HER and other electrochemical reactions such as oxygen evolution reaction and oxygen reduction reaction.									16	3	0	0	0	0	16			2574-0962			WOS:000465644600038

A new method for promoting the corrosion of stainless steel (304) was found which assisted the uniform formation of oxygen evolution reaction (OER) enhancing NiO incorporated Fe2O3 nanocrystals with the simultaneous reduction in the surface distribution of OER inactive Cr. An equimolar combination of KOH and hypochlorite was used as the corroding agent at 180 degrees C. The effect of corrosion time on the OER activity was studied and found that better water oxidation performance was observed when the corrosion time was 12 h (SS-12). The SS-12 showed an abnormal enhancement in OER activity compared to the untreated SS and other optimized versions of the same by requiring very low overpotentials of 260, 302, and 340 mV at the current densities of 10, 100, and 500 mA cm(-2) along with a very low Tafel slope in the range of 35.6 to 43.5 mV dec(-1). These numbers have certainly shown the high-performance electrocatalytic water oxidizing ability of SS-12. The comparative study revealed that the state-of-the-art IrO2 had failed to compete with our performance improved catalytic water oxidation anode "the SS-12". This fruitful finding indicates that the SS-12 has the potential to be an alternate anode material to precious IrO2/RuO2 for alkaline water electrolyzers in future.									58	2	0	0	2	0	58			2168-0485			WOS:000414825900061

A large number of high-performance electrocatalysts have been developed for HER accompanied by recent significant advances in exploring its electrochemical nature. Herein we present a critical appraisal of both theoretical and experimental studies of HER electrocatalysts with special emphasis on the electronic structure, surface (electro)chemistry, and molecular design. It addresses the importance of correlating theoretical calculations and electrochemical measurements toward better understanding of HER electrocatalysis at the atomic level. Fundamental concepts in the computational quantum chemistry and its relation to experimental electrochemistry are also presented along with some featured examples.									1285	65	1	0	60	0	1299			1433-7851	1521-3773		WOS:000347065100006	25384712

Here, NixFe80-xB20 (x = 70, 60, 50, 40, 30, hereafter referred to as NFB) amorphous alloys, with high mechanical strength, excellent corrosion resistance, and unique atomic structure, are fabricated as efficient water oxidation electrocatalysts in alkaline solutions. Ni40Fe40B20 amorphous ribbons achieve only 319 mV of overpotential at 10 mA center dot cm-2 with a Tafel slope of 56 mV dec-1 and exhibit excellent long-term stability for 24 h at 10 mA center dot cm-2 and 100 mA center dot cm-2 in 1 M KOH solution, which outperform the commercial RuO2 electrocatalyst. It is worth noting that the OER performance of NixFe80-xB20 amorphous electrocatalysts after long-term chronopotentiometry test displays more effectively, which can be ascribed to the surface construction. Meanwhile, the analysis of the morphology and structure of the electrocatalysts reveal that continuous oxidation during the OER process induces the structural reorganization on the surface of the electrocatalysts, which can enhance the electron transfer process , adsorption of the reaction intermediates to optimize the OER performance.

Cobalt based MOF and their rGO composites were solvothermally synthesized. Prepared samples were further characterized for structural and morphological analysis through X-rays diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Fourier transform Infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy and Energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDX) techniques. During CV studies the main emphasis was to observe the effect of rGO concentration on electrochemical response of synthesized materials for OER. Co BTC-5 wt % rGO (Cobalt benzene tricarboxlic acid-reduced graphene oxide) composite with current density of 10 mA/cm(2) at over potential 0.29 V vs. RHE proved to be a potential candidate due to its high activity and stability for OER.

We have developed a one-step catalytic chemical vapor deposition method to grow a highly graphitized graphene nanoflake (GF)-carbon nanotube (CNT) hybrid material doped simultaneously with single atoms of N, Co, and Mo (N-Co-Mo-GF/CNT). This high-surface-area material has a mesoporous structure, which facilitates oxygen mass transfer within the catalyst film, and exhibits a high electrocatalytic activity and stability in oxygen reduction and evolution reactions (ORR and OER) in alkaline media. We have shown that in this metal (M)-N-C catalyst, M (Co, Mo)-C centers are the main sites responsible for OER, while, for ORR, both M and N-C centers synergistically serve as the active sites. We systematically investigated tuning of the ORR and OER activity of the porous catalyst depending on the choice of the underlying substrate. The ORR kinetic current and OER activity for N-Co-Mo-GF/CNT were significantly enhanced when the catalyst was deposited onto a Ni substrate, resulting in an advanced electrocatalytic performance compared to the best bifunctional ORR/OER catalysts reported so far. Using a developed scanning electrochemical microscopy analysis method, we demonstrated that the higher OER reactivity on Ni was attributable to the formation of underlying catalyst/Ni interfacial sites, which are accessible due to the porous, electrolyte-permeable structure of the catalyst.									61	3	0	0	2	0	62			2155-5435			WOS:000543700400017

In this work, the overall water splitting process was carried out in a single reactor with a Nation membrane dividing into twin chambers where CuFeO2 and Bi20TiO32 are as hydrogen and oxygen photocatalyst powders respectively. Reduced graphene oxides were used as a collector extender for electron conduction during in a Z-scheme photocatalytic water splitting system. Branched copper wires were employed to enhance electron collection from the reduced graphene oxides in the twin reactor system used for water splitting under light illumination. The evolution rate of hydrogen and oxygen was 2.23 and 1.14 mu mol/h, respectively in the twin reactor, which is close to the stoichiometric ratio of 2:1. As compared to a single reactor, photocatalytic water splitting with separate evolution of H-2 and O-2 using a twin reactor device is vital since it avoids the explosion potential and hydrogen-purification cost. This redox mediator-free device has the potential for a wider range of applications and reduced the resistance losses resulting from the wiring and the cost related to a mediator. Consequently, this twin reactor with a redox mediator-free approach provides a new opportunity for further improving the efficiency of solar energy conversion reactions. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Recently, some low-cost and resourceful two-dimensional (2D) semiconductor materials such as transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) and layered oxides, have attracted increasing attention in electrocatalysis applications in virtue of their comparable catalytic activity and long-term stability to conventional noble metal-based catalysts (e.g. Pt/C, RuO2, IrO2, etc.). However, the intrinsic activity of some 2D materials still cannot meet the increasing requirement for highly efficient and reliable eletrocatalysts for future energy conversion and storage systems. In this context, designing elctrocatalysts with sufficient amount of active sites accessible for electrolyte, high activity of each active sites, and excellent conductivity is of great significance. To this end, defect engineering is a powerful strategy for tailoring the physical and chemical properties of 2D materials for efficient electrocatalysis. In this article, an overview of recent progress on defect engineering in 2D eletrocatalysts for HER, ORR and OER is presented. The effects of defects on the structure and tuned properties of 2D materials in eletrocatalysts applications are also summarized. Additionally, the challenges and opportunities ahead in this emerging field are also proposed. (C) 2018 The Chinese Ceramic Society.

A smooth Ni film has been electrodeposited on the Ti substrate from a Watts bath and its surface layers spontaneously exchanged with metallic Ir upon treatment with an Ir(IV) solution. Anodization of the resulting Ir(Ni)/Ti electrodes by means of continuous potential cycling in acid solutions resulted in the formation of porous IrO2 coatings showing typical Ir oxide/hydroxide surface electrochemistry. SEM pictures revealed that the thus prepared IrO2/Ir(Ni)/Ti electrodes consisted of continuous films with a nodular morphology (as confirmed by AFM). The composition of the coatings was estimated by EDS and XPS spectroscopy while the Ir mass loading was determined by ICP-MS following etching in acid. These electrodes have been tested as oxygen evolution reaction (OER) anodes by slow potential sweep voltammetry and were proven comparable or better than state-of-the-art thin thermal film and nanoparticulate IrNiOx-based electrodes (exhibiting ca 2 A mg(lr)(-1) at eta=300 mV). The recently established enhancement of IrO2 OER activity by Ni, combined with the widespread use of Ti as a stable electrode substrate, make IrO2/Ir(Ni)/Ti attractive candidates for Dimensionally Stable Electrodes (DSAs).

A heat-treatment procedure was effective to recover catalyst powders free from organic carbon species which could be resulted in the traces of ethanol as solvent. Voltammetry (CV and LSV) and electrochemical impedance Spectroscopy (EIS) were used to determine the capacitance and the kinetic parameters of the RuO2 anodes for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The utilization of this catalyst as anode in a single cell PEM electrolyzer has shown high activity toward pure H-2 and O-2 gases production. Exchange current density and Tafel slope of 3.3 10(-8) A cm(-2) and 51 mV dec(-1), respectively determined at 60 degrees C, showed that the H2O oxidation to O-2 was limited by intermediate species formation step. During the durability tests in a 25 cm(2) single PEM water electrolyzer (PEMWE) supplied by a solar power profile, the area resistance was raised in the 300-345 m Omega cm(2) range and an efficiency loss of 330 mu V h(-1) was measured from 1.85V at 1 A cm(-2) and 80 degrees C.

As such, in this review, we summarize the recent progress in the design and synthesis of TM/carbon hybrids with sophisticated nanostructures and their application in overall water splitting. Our attention was focused on three important categories of TM/carbon hybrids, namely transition metal alloy (TMA)/carbon hybrids, transition metal sulfide (TMS)/carbon hybrids, and transition metal phosphide (TMP)/carbon hybrids. We close this article with the challenges and outlook on TM/carbon hybrids as efficient and low-cost electrocatalysts, thereby promoting the development of this important area.									72	5	0	0	3	0	72			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000474712700002

Herein, non-noble metal-based Ni-Co-S bifunctional catalysts with tunable stoichiometry and morphology are realized. The engineering of electronic structure and subsequent morphological design synergistically contributes to significantly elevated electrocatalytic performance. Stable overpotentials (eta(10)) of 243 mV (vs reversible hydrogen electrode) for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and 80 mV for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), as well as Tafel slopes of 54.9 mV dec(-1) for OER and 58.5 mV dec(-1) for HER, are demonstrated. In addition, density functional theory calculations are performed to determine the optimal electronic structure via the electron density differences to verify the enhanced OER activity is related to the Co top site on the (110) surface. Moreover, the tandem bifunctional NiCo2S4 exhibit a required voltage of 1.58 V (J = 10 mA cm(-2)) for simultaneous OER and HER, and no obvious performance decay is observed after 72 h. When integrated with a GaAs solar cell, the resulting photoassisted water splitting electrolyzer shows a certified solar-to-hydrogen efficiency of up to 18.01%, further demonstrating the feasibility of engineering protocols and the promising potential of bifunctional NiCo2S4 for large-scale overall water splitting.									97	4	0	0	4	0	96			1616-301X	1616-3028		WOS:000459800400006

Herein, urchin-like CoP microspheres have been synthesized by a facile hydrothermal method with cetrimonium bromide as soft template. In alkaline solution, the as-prepared CoP catalyzes the ORR with an onset potential of -0.11 V (vs. Ag/AgCl) and a potential gap of 62 mV compared with commercial Pt/C catalyst. Meanwhile, the CoP catalyst exhibits better OER activities than the commercial RuO2 catalyst. Interestingly, when employed as cathodic catalyst for Li-air batteries, the battery shows good discharge capacity of 2994 mAh g(-1) at 100 mA g(-1), high round-trip efficiency of over 90%, excellent rate capability and cycle stability of sustaining 80 cycles without any capacity degradation at a high discharge current density of 500 mA g(-1).

Here, we report a facile method to design a nanosheet-like structure of Fe3C, perpendicularly grown on Ni foam (NF) as a catalyst for OER by hydrothermal reaction and annealing treatment at a low temperature. The synthesized Fe3C has good conductivity, small charge transfer resistance (R-ct), high active site density, and excellent stability, which make it highly efficient OER catalyst. Fe3C/NF has a low overpotential of 262 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) and a small Tafel slope of 49 mV dec(-1). Remarkably, Fe3C/NF also has good electrochemical stability, which helps maintain its activity in 1.0 M KOH solution for at least 100 h. Therefore, the simple method to prepare perpendicularly grown Fe3C on a NF substrate can enhance the OER properties, which make Fe3C/NF a promising material for replacing noble metal-based catalysts for OER applications.

In the present study, we combine theoretical simulations with experimental approaches to design and synthesize NiFeW layered double hydroxide (LDH) for efficient OER in alkaline electrolytes. Density functional theory with the Hubbard U (DFT + U) calculations suggests that W, a high-valence metal, can improve the catalytic activity of Fe sites and optimize adsorption energies for OER intermediates at the surface of NiFeW LDH. Electrochemical measurements of the as-synthesized NiFeW LDH with a constant mass loading reveals that the LDH with the NiFeW molar ratio of 4:1:1 presented the highest intrinsic OER activity among all bi- and trimetallic LDH catalysts in this study. Furthermore, the nanostructures with the optimal active metal molar ratio are in situ grown on hydrophilic-treated carbon paper to fabricate an integrated 3D electrode with an overpotential of 248 mV at the catalytic current density of 20 mA cm(-2) and a low Tafel slope of 68 mV dec(-1) in 1.0 M KOH solution. This indicates that NiFeW LDH is among the most active NiFe-based OER electrocatalysts reported to date. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and elemental analysis confirm that the optimized Ni Fe W LDH presents a stable chemical composition and Ni, Fe, and W are still present in the catalyst after alkaline OER measurements. These findings offer new insights and avenues for the future design and study of stable and active multi-metal-based OER electrocatalysts.									17	0	0	0	4	0	17			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000709293900002

Herein, tricomponent metal phosphides with hollow structures are synthesized from cobalt-contained metal organic frameworks (MOFs), i.e., ZIF-67, by tailoring the feeding ratios of Ni and Fe, followed by a high-temperature reduction and a subsequent phosphidation process. Excellent OER activity and long-time stability are achieved in 1 M NaOH aqueous solution, with an overpotential of 329 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) and Tafel slope of 48.2 mV dec(-1), even superior to the noble metal-based catalyst. It is evidenced that the formed (oxyhydr)oxide/phosphate species by in situ electrochemical surface oxidation are responsible for active OER. Accordingly, the simultaneous introduction of external Ni and Fe elements significantly influences the electronic structures of the parent metal phosphides, leading to the in situ electrochemical formation of surface active layer with decreased OER activation energy for greatly improved water oxidation performance. This electronic structure tuning strategy by introducing multicomponent metals demonstrates a versatile method to use MOFs as precursors for synthesizing high-efficient water splitting electrocatalysts.									54	5	0	0	4	0	54			1613-6810	1613-6829		WOS:000443012700010	30084542

Herein, a facile three-step process to rationally design advanced NiCo2O4/MoO2@atomic layer deposition (ALD)-NiO heteronanostructure arrays on a nickel foam substrate is reported. By effective interface construction, the optimal electronic structure and coordination environment are created at the interface in the heteronanostructure, which can provide rich reaction sites and short ion diffusion paths. Notably, density functional theory calculations reveal that the MoO2@ALD-NiO nanointerface exhibits highly appropriate energetics for alkaline oxygen/hydrogen evolution reactions (OER/HER), thereby accelerating the enhancement in electrochemical activities. Benefiting from the heteronanostructure containing abundant nanointerfaces, NiCo2O4/MoO2@ALD-NiO displays remarkable HER (57.1 mV at 10 mA cm(-2)) and OER (372.3 mV at 100 mA cm(-2)) activities and excellent long-term stability in a 1 M KOH solution.

However, main cathodic and hydrogen evolution reactions have no effect on the inactivation efficiency, which reduces the overall reaction efficiency. Inactivation efficiency can be improved by inducing the oxygen reduction reactions (ORRs) on a cathode. Oxygen can be kreduced to H2O2 under 2e(-) reactions with ORR catalysts, and OH can be produced by H2O2 under ultraviolet (UV) irradiation, which is beneficial to microorganism deactivation. This work investigated the contributions of ORR in a graphene-like carbon nitride (g-C3N4) to the PEC activities of a ZnWO4 anode. Results indicated that microorganisms were deactivated completely after 18 min under 0.7 V bias potential when ORR was used on the g-C3N4 cathode, and thus approximately one of the total time was conserved. ORR on the g-C(3)N4 cathode plays a key role in PEC inactivation under low voltage potential. The g-C3N4 ORR in seawater involves two electron reactions and generates H2O2, which results in high inactivation efficiency under UV irradiation. This work shows that the search for an efficient 2e(-) reaction ORR catalyst is of considerable importance in improving ballast water treatment.									15	0	0	0	1	0	15			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000441281300020

In single-atom catalysts, the SMAs can promote the chemical and catalytic activities of host atoms, which may act as secondary active sites, resulting in a significant synergistic effect on the catalytic performance. Using density functional theory calculations, we studied the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) on two different types of active sites: single metal (M-1) atoms and the neighboring host atoms of several M-1/g-C3N4 samples. The contributions of M-1 and host atoms towards the reduction of the OER/ORR overpotentials of Fe-1, Co-1, Ni-1, Cu-1 and Zn-1/g-C3N4, bifunctional electrocatalysts with the OER/ORR overpotentials of 0.50-0.70 V were investigated. Finally, new M-1/g-C3N4 catalysts with high OER/ORR performances could be estimated based on the d-band centre of the M-1 atoms in the future.									54	2	0	0	2	0	53			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000462669600044	30839964

It demonstrates that the g-C3N4 nanosheets in the CoOx/mC@MoS2@g-C3N4 composite can accelerate electron transport and simultaneously result in abundant N-dopants and Co-N complex formation, which could be further utilized as new catalytically active sites. The synergistic effect among different components endows the as-synthesized composite with dual electrocatalytic activity for both ORR and HER with highly catalytic efficiency. This shows that the developed CoOx/mC@MoS2@g-C3N4 composite exhibits an onset overpotential of 0.89 V (vs. reversible hydrogen electrode) and a Tafel slope of 84 mV dec(-1) in KOH (0.1 M) for ORR Concurrently, this electrocatalyst shows a low onset potential of -0.031 V (vs. reversible hydrogen electrode) and a Tafel slope of 66 mV dec(-1) in H2SO4 (0.5 M) for HER The present finding may inspire the development of remarkably excellent electrochemical catalysts and devices and broaden the applications of metal organic framework-derived composites as efficient, economical, stable, and nonprecious metal electrocatalysts with bifunctionality toward ORR and HER									30	0	0	0	4	0	30			2168-0485			WOS:000444924500129

Herein, we report the rational design and experimental realization of a new metal-organic open framework (MOF) to enable a facile and scalable synthesis of transition metal phosphide (TMP) and sulfide (TMS) composite nanoparticle electrocatalysts encapsulated by heteroatom-doped carbon (TMP/C and TMS/C) as bifunctional electrocatalysts for water splitting. Using this new MOF, we synthesized NiP/NiFeP/C and MoWS/MoP/C composite nanoparticle electrocatalysts that exhibited outstanding electrocatalytic activities and durability that are among the higher values reported in the literature for HER and OER electrocatalysts. A two-electrode water-splitting device using our bifunctional NiP/NiFeP/C catalyst reached 10 mA cm(-2) at a cell voltage of 1.53 V and 100 mA cm(-2) at 1.68 V in 1.0 M KOH. The device showed excellent stability for overall water splitting with almost 98% retention of its initial current of 100 mA cm(-2) for over 20 h. Our results demonstrate the versatility of the new MOF to synthesize highly active and stable TM-based electrocatalysts for water splitting.									35	2	0	0	1	0	35			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000463814800057

In this paper, we applied intensive density functional theory (DFT) calculations to study the electrocatalytic activities of gamma-graphyne nanoribbons (gamma GyNRs) toward the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Our results revealed gamma GyNRs to be excellent bifunctional CMFCs after functionalization by termination or N-doping at the edge to introduce proper spin densities. The scaling relationship analysis enhanced our earlier understanding that the binding strength of H atom (Delta EH) is a general descriptor for designing bifunctional electrocatalysts for HER and ORR. Further study revealed that the light gradient boosting machine is a promising machine learning algorithm to accurately predict the electrocatalytic activities of gamma GyNRs. Feature importance analysis suggested that the surrounding environment of the active site plays a more significant role than we previously anticipated. Overall, we suggest promising gamma GyNRs as HER and ORR bifunctional electrocatalysts for the first time and provide deeper insight into the reaction mechanism, which is beneficial for the rational design of novel CMFCs.									2	0	0	0	1	0	2			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000740946400005

The single-atom catalytic (SAC) technique emerged as a promising strategy to reach If, this goal but is currently facing obstacles such as migration and aggregation of active atoms and low metal loading. We demonstrated from first principles that the two-dimensional (2D) covalent organic frameworks (COFs) of phthalocyanines and pyrazine linkages can firmly anchor transition-metal (TM) atoms. The resultant TM-embedded COFs (TM-COFs) exhibit multifunctional electrocatalytic activity for HER, OER, and ORR, which can be attributed to the synergistic effect of the anchored TM atoms and COFs. Specifically, Mn- and Cr-COFs are predicted to have extremely low overpotentials of -0.014/0.44/0.31 and -0.239/0.35/0.29 V for HER/OER/ORR, which are comparable or even superior to those of the well-developed noble catalysts. We also proposed the electron transfer Delta delta from TM atom to the framework and p-band center epsilon(p), of carbon atoms as descriptors for the adsorption strength of intermediates on the TM-COF monolayers. In view of the recent experimental progress on the synthesis of the TM-COFs, these computational results offer not only economical alternatives of noble catalysts but also a promising strategy for the design of multifunctional electrocatalysts.									29	3	0	0	0	0	29			1932-7447	1932-7455		WOS:000562945600024

Here, we report a synthesis strategy that uses a two-step reaction of hydrothermal co-precipitation and sulfuration to directly grow starfish-like spinel NixCo3-xS4 (0 <= x <= 3) nanorods on carbon cloth through controlling the concentration of Ni. The as-obtained Ni0.58Co2.42S4 possess the anodic overpotential of 215 mV in alkaline media to drive the current density of 10 mA cm(-2), better than advanced precious metal catalysts RuO2 and IrO2. Furthermore, compared with other synthesized catalysts with different nickel ion concentrations, Ni0.58Co2.42S4 has a unique starfish morphology and highest value of Co3+/Co2+ and lowest value of Ni3+/Ni2+ sites, which is helpful for the dissipation of gas products on the catalyst surface and exhibits superior OER activity. The optimal configuration of surface valence states of Ni0.58Co2.42S4 sample can optimize the adsorption, activation and desorption of water and oxygen, thus significantly improve the electrocatalytic activity.

We report on the stability of La2CuO4 in the voltage regimes relevant to oxygen reduction, hydrogen evolution and CO2 reduction. Voltammetric experiments, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction reveal both surface and bulk electron transfer reactions. Application of anodic voltages results in expansion in the crystal c-axis, while cathodic voltages induce contraction. The ability to catalyze each of the three cathodic reactions is confirmed, but X-ray diffraction and electron microscopy reveal amorphization of the electrocatalyst at voltages below -0.4 V that affects both the oxygen reduction and CO2 reduction reactions. While the ionic conductivity of Ruddlesden Popper oxides introduces intriguing properties, it simultaneously introduces the risk of structural instability in catalytically relevant voltages.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			2196-0216			WOS:000490027600021

Electrochemical synthesis of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) through a two-electron oxygen reduction reaction (2e-ORR) or a two-electron water oxidation reaction (2e-WOR) has emerged as an appealing process for onsite production of this chemically valuable oxidant. On-site produced H2O2 can be applied for wastewater treatment in remote locations or any applications where H2O2 is needed as an oxidizing agent.

In the case of the MnO2 electrode it is shown that the electro-oxidation of Cr(III) proceeds involving the oxygen-containing particles chemisorbed on the anode. The first reaction step is the anodic ionization of water resulting in the formation of OH-groups chemisorbed on the electrode surface which interact with the Cr(III) compounds in the following chemical step. The adsorbed complex formed in this case is oxidized to Cr(VI) compounds In the following electrochemical step. It is assumed that there is a correlation between the reaction rate of the Cr(III) electro-oxidation and the adhesion strength between the electrode surface and chemisorbed oxygen. The series of increasing electrocatalytic activities correlates almost completely with that of the decreasing adhesion strengths between the oxygen-containing particles and the electrode surface.									26	1	0	0	0	0	27			0013-4686			WOS:A1993KH92200038

Thus, modulating the surface electron density of electrocatalysts is an effective strategy to boost the electrocatalytic activity of targeted reactions. Herein, the NiSe2/FeSe2 p-p heterojunction is constructed via a simple selenization method for both oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and urea oxidation reaction (UOR). The designed NiSe2/FeSe2 electrocatalyst exhibits a superior activity towards OER, which only requires a low overpotential of 256 mV to reach a current density of 10 mA cm(-2), and surpasses other selenides and even the state-of-the-art RuO2. Impressively, when employed as the UOR electrode, the NiSe2/FeSe2 heterojunction needs only 127 mV overpotential at 50 mA cm(-2), remarkably superior to other selenides and confirming the less energy consumption for UOR. The comprehensive analysis demonstrates that the well-designed built-in electric field at the heterointerface of NiSe2/FeSe2 p-p heterojunction due to the difference of energy levels can expedite the charge transfer and thus strengthen the conductivity of heterojunction electrocatalyst. Moreover, the self-driven electron transfer across the NiSe2/FeSe2 heterointerface can induce local charge redistribution at the interface region, which is beneficial for the adsorption of OH- and urea owing to the electrostatic interaction. Therefore, the designed NiSe2/FeSe2 p-p heterojunction with regulated electronic structure displays extraordinary electrocatalytic activity for both the OER and UOR. This study demonstrates a novel strategy to manipulate the surface/interface charge states of electrocatalysts for improving the catalytic activity of OER and UOR, and provides new guidelines for exploring other superior electrocatalysts.									49	0	0	0	5	0	49			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000703890500005

The recent mechanistic understandings (e.g., active sites) of metal-free carbon catalysts in oxygen evolution reaction (OER), however, are still rife with controversies. In this work, we describe a facile protocol in species were used as model structures to investigate the explicit roles which eight kinds of aromatic molecules with designated single oxygen of each common oxygen group in OER at a molecular level. These model structures were decorated onto typical nanocarbon surfaces like onion-like carbons (OLC) or multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNT) to build aromatic molecule-modified carbon systems. We show that edge (including zigzag and armchair) quinones in a conjugated pi network are the true active centers, and the roles of ether and carboxyl groups are excluded in the OER process. The plausible rate-determining step could be singled out by H/D kinetic isotope effects. The turnover frequency per C=0 (similar to 0.323 s(-1) at eta = 340 mV) in 0.1 M KOH and the optimized current density (10 mA/cm(2) at 1.58 V vs RHE) of quinone-modified carbon systems are comparable to those of promising metal-based catalysts.									33	7	0	0	3	0	33			0002-7863			WOS:000449887800030	30359010

Herein, a composition (Fe and Mn)-engineering approach that is capable of triggering efficient hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) bifunctionality into coral-like 1T-MoS2 nanorods for overall water splitting is reported. The results demonstrate that composition engineering induces rich crystal defects and electronic structure variation of the freestanding coral-like 1T-MoS2, leading to outstanding HER (overpotential of 34.1 mV at 10 mA cm(-2)) and OER (overpotential of 220.0 mV at 50 mA cm(-2)) activity and excellent stability in alkaline media.

The overall OER performance is often largely limited by uncontrollable interface when active catalysts are loaded on conductive supports, for which polymer binders are widely used, but inevitably block species transportation channels. Here, a scalable fabrication approach to freestanding graphitized carbon nanofiber networks is reported, which provides abundant sites for in situ growing Fe/Ni catalysts with the improved interface. The fabricated hybrid membrane exhibits high activity and durability toward OER, with an overpotential of 280 mV at a geometrical current density of 10 mA cm(-2) and a Tafel slope of 30 mV dec(-1) in alkaline medium. As implemented as a freestanding electrode, the 3D hybrid structure achieves further enhanced OER performance with an overpotential down to 215 mV at 10 mA cm(-2).

However, their further development and application is severely lagged due to the lack of high efficient and durable bifunctional oxygen electrocatalysts. The widely applied carbon-based catalysts are thermodynamically instable during battery charging. Herein, TiC supported amorphous MnOx (a-MnOx/TiC) is reported for the first time as electrocatalyst for the corrosion resistant oxygen electrodes of ZABs. A-MnOx/TiC delivers a remarkable activity and stability toward both oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) with a high half-wave potential (0.8 V) for ORR and a low potential (1.56 V) at 10 mA cm(-2) for OER, which far outperforms the state of the art ORR catalyst (Pt/C) and OER catalyst (IrO2), as well as the Pt/C-IrO2 and a-MnOx/C bifunctional catalysts. The excellent bifunctional activity of a-MnOx/TiC can be attributed to the efficient synergistic effect between the active amorphous MnOx catalyst and the highly conductive and stable TiC support. More impressively, a-MnOx/TiC demonstrates an outstanding electrochemical stability in strong alkaline electrolyte under OER condition in contrast to the readily oxidized carbon-based a-MnOx/C catalysts. ZAB with a-MnOx/TiC delivers a greater discharge performance with a peak power density of 217.1 mW cm(-2) than that of Pt/C-based ZAB, and a surpassing discharge and charge cycling performance and stability to ZABs with Pt/C-IrO2 and a-MnOx/C. Furthermore, a-MnOx/TiC can be applied for solid-state ZABs which exhibit excellent mechanical flexibility and cycle stability under their flat and bent states. The a-MnOx/TiC bifunctional electrocatalyst with extraordinarily high activity and electrochemical stability provides a promising approach for exploring corrosion resistant electmcatalysts for Zn-air batteries with high efficiency and long-term cycling stability.									58	4	0	0	3	0	59			2211-2855	2211-3282		WOS:000504828100087

Photosynthetic oxygen evolution was measured, and chlorophyll a (Chl a) fluorescence transient O-J-I-P (O, J, land P point in primary photochemistry reaction curve in photosystem II) curves associated with its specific parameters were determined. A concentrationdependent inhibition of S. trochoidea was observed when the dried seaweed was added. The rate of lightsaturated maximum photosynthetic oxygen evolution (P-max) was markedly decreased, and the O-J-I-P curve coupled with its specific parameters was reduced. The inhibitory effects of the macroalga on the microalga, according to the JIP-test (the relative fluorescence analysis based on O-J-I-P curve) and the activity of oxygen evolution, include a decrease in the number of active reaction centers, the blocking-up of the electron transport chain, and the damage to the oxygen-evolving complex. This study suggests that dried G. lemaneiforrnis is effective in inhibiting photosynthesis of S. trochoidea, and could thus be a potential candidate for mitigating S. trochoidea blooms.

Here we demonstrate a facile in-situ sulfurization strategy to construct an additive-free electrode with low-crystalline Co9S8-Ni3S2 nanohybrid under the joint effects of fast sulfurization and lattice-mismatched growth. The Co9S8-Ni3S2 nanohybrid exhibits semi-spherical architecture constructed with interconnected nanoflakes, and contains mesopores with an average pore size of 12.66 nm. The crystalline degrees of Ni3S2 and Co9S8 in the nanohybrid are estimated to be as low as 18.66% and 5.46%, respectively. For OER in 1 M KOH, the electrode attains a benchmark of 10 mA cm(-2) at a very low overpotential (eta(10)) of 220 mV and impressively demonstrates the outstanding OER stability lasting for 900 h at about 50 mA cm(-2), which highlights its great potential applications in water splitting devices. More importantly, this work discloses the crucial contribution from low-crystalline Co9S8-Ni3S2 nanohybrid to the high-efficiency OER, the key role of dynamic balance related to electroctatalytic activity in sustaining the ultralong-term stability, and the mechanisms behind the matter evolutions from Co9S8-Ni3S2 into CoOOH-NiOOH species.

Currently, the OER relies on the noble-metal catalysts; since with other catalysts, its operation environment is greatly limited in alkaline conditions. Herein, an advanced water oxidation catalyst based on metallic Co9S8 decorated with single-atomic Mo (0.99 wt%) is synthesized (Mo-Co9S8@C). It exhibits pronounced water oxidization activity in acid, alkali, and neutral media by showing positive onset potentials of 200, 90, and 290 mV, respectively, which manifests the best Co9S8-based single-atom Mo catalyst till now. Moreover, it also demonstrates excellent HER performance over a wide pH range. Consequently, the catalyst even outperforms noble metal Pt/IrO2-based catalysts for overall water splitting (only requiring 1.68 V in acid, and 1.56 V in alkaline). Impressively, it works under a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) with no obvious decay during a 24 h (0.5 m H2SO4) and 72 h (1.0 m KOH) durability experiment. Density functional theory (DFT) simulations reveal that the synergistic effects of atomically dispersed Mo with Co-containing substrates can efficiently alter the binding energies of adsorbed intermediate species and decrease the overpotentials of the water splitting.									118	6	0	0	5	0	119			1614-6832	1614-6840		WOS:000501927900001

This study introduces a remarkably active OER catalyst that is based on the dispersion of Ir nanoparticles on a highly conductive oxide support. The catalyst was designed in a way to combine all characteristics that have been reported to enhance the OER activity on an Ir oxide-based catalyst, including high catalyst dispersion and controlling the Ir catalyst particle size, so that this design approach provides both high surface area to Ir mass ratio and at the same time ensures maximum synergetic interaction with the oxide support, termed strong metal-support interaction (SMSI). This was achieved through using a high surface area (50 m(2)/g) and highly conductive antimony-doped tin oxide support (2 S/cm), where combining a high catalyst dispersion and maximum SMSI resulted in a very high OER activity of the Ir/ATO catalyst (approximate to 1100 A/g(Ir), at 80 degrees C and 1.45 V-RHE). This enhanced activity will allow a significant reduction (ca. 75-fold) in the precious metal catalyst loading when this catalyst is implemented in the anode of a PEMWE.									40	0	0	0	2	0	40			2574-0970			WOS:000526396200011

A simple but promising method for simultaneous analysis of these two types oxygen in steel samples was developed in the present study using Inert Gas Fusion Infrared Absorption Method. By utilizing different carbothermic reaction temperature for each type of oxygen, the chemically dissolved oxygen (soluble oxygen) was first separated from the steel specimen at a low reaction temperature, while the physically dispersed oxygen (insoluble oxygen in the form of oxide inclusion) was separated at a higher reaction temperature. This idea was applied to a number of Al-killed ultra low carbon steel specimens, which contain alumina inclusions. It was shown that separation of the soluble oxygen and the insoluble oxygen was possible. The obtained oxygen content in this new method was independently validated by a conventional Inert Gas Fusion Infrared Absorption Method for the total oxygen content and by cross-sectional analysis of non-metallic inclusion for the insoluble oxygen. A possible supersaturation state of liquid steel after RH process was observed.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			0915-1559	1347-5460		WOS:000708579000018

MnPcs were substituted with alkynyl groups, which are reactive moieties in click electrochemistry (CEC) reactions. Mn(III) cations were incorporated into the cavity of the Pc ring in order to increase the redox activity of the complexes. Electrochemical characterizations of the complexes were determined by voltammetric and in situ spectroelectrochemical measurements in order to determine their possible technological applications. MnPc complexes illustrated five redox couples and these redox couples were assigned as [Cl-(MnPc2-)-Pc-III]/[Cl-(MnPc2-)-Pc-II](1-), [Cl-Mn(II)Pc2(-)](1-)/[Cl-(MnPc2-)-Pc-I](2-), [Cl-(MnPc2-)-Pc-I](2-)/[Cl-(MnPc3-)-Pc-I](3-), and [Cl-(MnPc2-)-Pc-III]/[Cl-(MnPc1-)-Pc-III](1+) redox processes. The position of the substituents affected the mechanism of the redox reactions and influenced the tendency to react with the molecular oxygen. Moreover, changing the position of the substituents slightly influenced the peak potentials and reversibility of the redox processes. For the applications, modified electrodes (ITO/PANI-N-3-MnPc and GCE/PANI-N-3-MnPc) were constructed with CEC reaction between azido functionalized polyaniline (PANI-N-3) and terminally alkynyl substituted MnPcs and these electrodes. Voltammetric characterizations of the modified electrodes illustrated suitable redox activity and conductivity for the practical applications. Finally, the GCE/PANI-N-3-MnPc electrode was tested as a potential electrocatalyst for water splitting reaction. Although the GCE/PANI-N-3-MnPc electrode did not catalyze the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), it significantly catalyzed the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in aqueous solution.									9	0	0	0	0	0	9			1463-9076	1463-9084		WOS:000412275200031	28929146

However, the electrocatalytic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) generally occurs at low rate due to the delayed reaction kinetics of four-electron transfer. Herein, a kind of crater-like micro-nano structure CuS three-dimensional electrode that was supported on a Cu foam was prepared and used as an electrode anode for overall water splitting. The superhydrophilic/underwater superaerophobic structure can significantly reduce the bubble adhesion on the electrode surface and improve the OER performance. The CuS/CF electrode showed good wettability and superaerophobicity with an underwater contact angle of 153.5 degrees. The CuS/CF (CuS/Cu foam) electrode has been proved to have excellent electrocatalytic activity for water decomposition. In 1.0 M KOH solution, the OER overpotential is 350 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) and the Tafel slope is 83 mV dec(-1). In acidic medium of 0.5 M H2SO4 solution, the overpotential of hydrogen evolution (HER) is 134 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) and the Tafel slope is 114 mV dec(-1). The underwater superaerophobic electrode still has strong stability after 10 h test. This work provides a new potential electrochemical catalyzed approach to water decomposition by constructing a super-infiltration electrode.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0927-7757	1873-4359		WOS:000737917100005

Herein, we prepared a three-dimensional (3D) bimetallic oxyhydroxide hybrid grown on a Ni foam (NiFeOOH/NF) prepared by immersing Ni foam (NF) into Fe(NO3)(3) solution. In this unique 3D structure, the NiFeOOH/NF hybrid was composed of crystalline Ni(OH)(2) and amorphous FeOOH evenly grown on the NF surface. As a bimetallic oxyhydroxide electrocatalyst, the NiFeOOH/NF hybrid exhibited excellent catalytic activity, surpassing not only the other reported Ni-Fe based electrocatalysts, but also the commercial Ir/C catalyst. In situ electrochemical Raman spectroscopy demonstrated the active FeOOH and NiOOH phases involved in the OER process. Profiting from the synergy of Fe and Ni catalytic sites, the NiFeOOH/NF hybrid delivered an outstanding OER performance under challenging industrial conditions in a 10.0 mol.L-1 KOH electrolyte at 80 degrees C, requiring potentials as small as 1.47 and 1.51 V to achieve the super-high catalytic current densities of 100 and 500 mA.cm(-2), respectively.

It showed enhanced electrocatalytic activity for oxygen evolution (water oxidation) reactions (OER) in an alkaline medium. These as-synthesized materials were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform-infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy, energy dispersive analysis of X-ray (EDAX), Raman spectroscopy and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The XRD studies confirmed that Co(3)O(4)had a cubic spinal structure and morphological studies based on TEM analysis showed that Co(3)O(4)existed with similar to 5 nm-thick chain-like nanostructures that decorated rGO. This Co3O4-modified reduced graphene oxide (Co3O4-rGO) electrocatalyst was found to be extraordinarily active towards oxygen evolution reactions (OER) and is one of the complex reactions of water splitting technique. This was further confirmed by an ultra-low onset potential of 1.38 Vvs.RHE with a high current density of 10 mA mg(-1)of Co(3)O(4)loading (calculated from TGA) at the constant potential of 1.50 Vvs.RHE. The enhancement factor of Co3O4-rGO = 2000 was almost 3.25 times higher compared with that of Co3O4= 600 under similar electrolytic conditions probably due to the synergetic co-operative interactions at modified interfaces. Chronoamperometric (i-t) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopic (EIS) measurements demonstrated higher current/potential stability and lower charge transfer resistance, respectively, for Co3O4-rGO compared with those of rGO and Co(3)O(4)towards the water oxidation reaction.									27	0	0	0	1	0	27			1144-0546	1369-9261		WOS:000571972400053

Herein, a hetero-nanostructured water splitting system was developed based on N-doped Ti3C2 (N10TC) MXene and NiFe layered double hydroxide (LDH) nanosheets. The oxygen evolution reaction performance of the NiFe-LDH significantly enhanced to approximately 8.8-fold after incorporation of N10TC. Meanwhile, the Tafel slope was only 58.1 mV dec(-1) with light irradiation, which is lower than pure NiFe-LDH nanosheets (76.9 mV dec(-1)). All results manifested the vital role of the N10TC MXene induced plasmonic hot carriers via electrophoto-excitation in enhancing the full water splitting performance of the as-prepared system. This work is expected to provide a platform for designing various plasmonic MXenes-based heterogeneous structures for highly efficient catalytic applications.									10	1	0	0	0	0	10			1864-5631	1864-564X		WOS:000630148100001	33729712

The precursors for the synthesis included an aqueous solution of SnF2 with an equilibrium pH value and the colloidal solution of IrOx center dot nH(2)O nanoparticles and Na-2[Ir(OH)(6)] mixture with pH = 10.5, obtained by the alkaline hydrolysis of the H2IrCI6 solution. The synthesized nanoscale oxide exhibited electrocatalytic properties in the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) upon water splitting in the acidic medium. A series of samples were obtained, synthesized as a result of 10, 30, and 50 SILD processing cycles. It was found that the films obtained as a result of 30 SILD cycles and heated in argon at a temperature of 300 degrees C had the best electrocatalytic properties in the reaction of oxygen evolution in the HClO4 solution. For these films, the overpotential value at a current density of 10 mA/cm(2) was 288 mV and the Tafel coefficient value totaled 56 mV/dec. Investigations by SEM, TEM, EDX, XRD, XPS and FTIR spectroscopy revealed that the samples were built of Ir0.7SnOx center dot nH(2)O amorphous nanoparticles with a size of 10-20 nm. For this kind of electrode, estimation of the specific mass of iridium showed that its amount is about 0.02 mg/cm(2).

The applied preparation methods in this research are thermal decomposition, electrophoretic deposition and Ni-Co alloy oxidation. The electrocatalytic properties measurement show that electrode prepared by electrophoretic deposition method has relative low overpotential and good electrocatalysis stability for OER in 1M KOH solutions. The thermal decomposition electrode has the highest apparent electrocatalytic properties but with worse stability than electrophoretic deposition electrode. Alloy oxidation method can also prepare NiCo2O4 electrode but the improvement of electrocatalytic properties is not obvious. The research found that electrophoretic deposition method is a promising method to prepare NiCo2O4 electrode. (c) 2005 International Association for Hydrogen Energy. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

The quest is ongoing to find a suitable catalyst to circumvent the problems associated with the precious metal Pt. Here, we report a facile and green strategy to fabricate CoFe nanoalloys encapsulated in N-doped graphene layers (CoxFe1-x@N-G) by pyrolysis and their catalytic activity toward ORR, HER, and hydrogenation of 4-NP. Intensive studies have been carried out to elucidate the roles of alloying and N-doping. The catalytic activity is found to improve with increasing amounts of Co in the CoFe core and N-doping in the graphene layers. A similar onset potential with better current density as compared to the state-of-the-art Pt/C catalyst in alkaline medium has been achieved for CoxFe1-x@N-G toward ORR activity. These catalysts also show efficient and highly stable HER activity and are very efficient and magnetically separable in the hydrogenation of 4-NP to 4-AP. Overall, the non-precious-metal alloy nanostructures can be exploited as multifunctional catalysts in fuel cells, hydrogen storage systems, and wastewater treatment.									37	0	0	0	1	0	37			2168-0485			WOS:000446413100021

Smooth iridium oxide thin-film model catalysts were synthesized at different temperatures. Thin-film catalysts minimize mass transport limitations, which tend to impede catalytic studies. Prior to the electrocatalytic investigation, the iridium oxide films were characterized by SEM, EDX, XRD, Raman spectroscopy and cyclic voltammetry. Temperature programmed reduction was applied to identify the oxide species formed as function of the calcination temperature. The TPR study was performed on inert silicon and titanium substrates to study iridium oxide properties alone and their interaction with the titanium substrate. Thus, it was possible to relate electrocatalytic oxygen evolution activity with the formation of the various oxide species.					2nd International Symposium on Electrochemical Synthesis of Fuels (ESF)2nd International Symposium on Electrochemical Synthesis of Fuels (ESF)	OCT 27-NOV 01, 2013OCT 27-NOV 01, 2013	Electrochem Soc Inc, High Temp Mat Div; Electrochem Soc Inc, Phys & Analyt Electrochemistry Div; Electrochem Soc Inc, Energy Technol Div; Electrochem Soc Inc, Ind Electrochemistry & Electrochem Engn Div; New Technol SubcommitteeElectrochem Soc Inc, High Temp Mat Div; Electrochem Soc Inc, Phys & Analyt Electrochemistry Div; Electrochem Soc Inc, Energy Technol Div; Electrochem Soc Inc, Ind Electrochemistry & Electrochem Engn Div; New Technol Subcommittee	San Francisco, CASan Francisco, CA	27	1	0	0	1	0	27			1938-5862		978-1-60768-447-3; 978-1-62332-093-5	WOS:000328212000005

Here, we report a facile electrodeposition process to immobilize nickel-iron layered double hydroxide (Ni-Fe LDH) nanoplates on three-dimensional electrochemically reduced graphene oxide (3D-ErGO) for water oxidation. This Ni-Fe LDH/3D-ErGO electrode has a three-dimensional interpenetrating network with Ni-Fe nanoplates uniformly decorated on graphene sheets. It has an electrochemically active surface area (EASA) 3.3 times that of conventional planar electrodes. The open porous structure of this electrode also makes its EASA fully accessible to the electrolyte for water oxidation and easy release of oxygen gas. This electrode can be directly used for catalysing the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in alkaline media without using a binder and conductive additive, exhibiting a small overpotential of 0.259 V and a low Tafel slope of 39 mV dec(-1). It outperforms the precious IrO2 catalyst in activity, kinetics, and electrochemical stability.									241	16	0	0	12	0	243			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000351552300028

However, inappropriate adsorption energy between OER intermediates and telluride leads to an unsatisfactory electrocatalytic intrinsic activity. Herein, we adopt a unique in-situ cathodic electrochemical activation process to facilitate the surface self-reconstruction to form oxygen vacancy (OV)-rich TeO2 layer onto Fe-doped NiTe (OV@Fe-NiTe). Characterizations and theoretical calculation demonstrate that the presence of the OV-rich TeO2 layer realizes the adjustment of D-band center of the active site that translates into an enhancement of the adsorption of *OOH intermediate and thus the optimization of the OER pathway. Consequently, the OV@Fe-NiTe only requires an ultralow overpotential of 245 mV to drive 100 mA cm(-2) in 1 M KOH, 95 mV lower than that of Fe-NiTe, and hence becoming the best water oxidation electrocatalysts amongst recently reported telluride electrocatalysts. This study presents a unique strategy to exploit telluride-based catalysts through electrochemical surface engineering.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000803806500002

J	Qiu, Lingshu; Zheng, Guokui; He, Yi; Lei, Lecheng; Zhang, Xingwang								Ultra-small Sn-RuO2 nanoparticles supported on N-doped carbon polyhedra for highly active and durable oxygen evolution reaction in acidic media								CHEMICAL ENGINEERING JOURNAL				409						128155	10.1016/j.cej.2020.128155				APR 1 2021	2021	Electrocatalytic water splitting in acid electrolyte is considered as one of the promising strategies to generate hydrogen. However, the industrial applications of electrolytic water are mainly hindered by the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) due to the high overpotential. Therefore, it is critical to develop highly active and durable electrocatalysts to reduce the overpotential. This work reports ultra-small Sn-RuO2 nanoparticles supported on N-doped carbon polyhedral are successfully synthesized through dipping and annealing. Integrating the merits of metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) and dopant atoms, the optimized catalyst Sn-RuO2@NPC displays a low overpotential of 178 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) and excellent long-term stability after continuous testing of 150 h in the acidic media, which surpassed most Ru-based OER catalysts. The density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that doping Sn into RuO2 could effectively improve the intrinsic OER activity of adjacent Ru sites, thereby reducing the Gibbs free energy of rate-determining steps. Notably, the crystal orbital Hamilton population (COHP) shows that the binding strength between catalytic active sites (Ru sites) and reaction intermediates (*O) is decreased due to the presence of Sn, which results in more easily forming the next reaction intermediates (*OOH) and then improving the water splitting activity. This work provides a new insight into an effective method of efficient electrocatalysts for water splitting in acidic media.									11	0	0	0	2	0	11			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000618777700002

The objective of this work was to study the influence of the presence of other ellagitannins and/or oxygen on the individual evolution of the main oak ellagitannins in simple model systems in order to understand their behaviours in more complex media, such as wine. In all the studied conditions, vescalagin disappeared faster than castalagin, highlighting its greater reactivity. Oxygen increased the individual disappearance rate, as also occurred when more than one type of ellagitannin was present, above all if the additional ellagitannin(s) contained the same conformation in C1 as vescalagin. Experimental data were fitted to a kinetic model considering both the oxygen-dependent and oxygen-independent reactions, making possible the comparison between individual compounds in different scenarios.									6	0	0	0	3	0	6			0308-8146	1873-7072		WOS:000460107400007	30827629

However, the reaction is often accompanied by unfavourable structural transformations and persistent electrochemical degradation, thereby precluding the practical application of this strategy. Here we explore the close interplay between the local structural change and oxygen electrochemistry during short- and long-term battery operation for layered TMOs. The substantially distinct evolution of the oxygen-redox activity and reversibility are demonstrated to stem from the different cation-migration mechanisms during the dynamic de/intercalation process. We show that the pi stabilization on the oxygen oxidation initially aids in the reversibility of the oxygen redox and is predominant in the absence of cation migrations; however, the pi-interacting oxygen is gradually replaced by sigma-interacting oxygen that triggers the formation of O-O dimers and structural destabilization as cycling progresses. More importantly, it is revealed that the distinct cation-migration paths available in the layered TMOs govern the conversion kinetics from pi to sigma interactions. These findings constitute a step forward in unravelling the correlation between the local structural evolution and the reversibility of oxygen electrochemistry and provide guidance for further development of oxygen-redox layered electrode materials.Transition metal oxide electrodes are promising for rechargeable batteries but are subject to suffer from structural transformations and electrochemical degradation. The evolution of oxygen-redox activity and reversibility in layered electrodes are shown to arise from cation-migration mechanisms during de/intercalation.									10	0	0	0	0	0	10			1476-1122	1476-4660		WOS:000770195000002	35301474

However, their stability under highly oxidizing environment is questionable but was rarely studied. Herein, NiFe-metal-organic framework (NiFe-MOFs) was conformally coated on oxygen-vacancy-rich BiVO4 (Ov-BiVO4) as the protective layer and cocatalyst, forming a core-shell structure with caffeic acid as bridging agent. The as-synthesized Ov-BiVO4@NiFe-MOFs exhibits enhanced stability and a remarkable photocurrent density of 5.3 +/- 0.15 mA cm(-2) at 1.23 V (vs. RHE). The reduced coordination number of Ni(Fe)-O and elevated valence state of Ni(Fe) in NiFe-MOFs layer greatly bolster OER, and the shifting of oxygen evolution sites from Ov-BiVO4 to NiFe-MOFs promotes Ov stabilization. Ovs can be effectively preserved by the coating of a thin NiFe-MOFs layer, leading to a photoanode of enhanced photocurrent and stability.									106	4	0	0	7	0	108			1433-7851	1521-3773		WOS:000589715700001	33006403

Factors influencing the mechanism of the pulse charge of the positive plate								JOURNAL OF POWER SOURCES				177	1			217	225		10.1016/j.jpowsour.2007.10.095				FEB 15 2008	2008	The mechanism of the positive plate charge in pulse regime was studied in model lead-acid cells with one positive and two negative plates (8 Ah each) and Ag/Ag2SO4 reference electrodes. The results showed that the evolution of the electrode potential is much slower on the positive plate than on the negative plate. Regardless of this fact, the calculated capacitive current of charge and self-discharge of the electrochemical double layer (EDL) during the "ON" and "OFF" half-periods of the pulse current square waves is comparable with the charge current amplitude. The result is due to the high values of the EDL on the surface of the lead dioxide active material. The influence of different factors like state of charge, state of health, pulse frequency, current amplitude and open circuit stay before the polarization was discussed. The previously determined optimal frequency of 1 Hz was associated with a maximum in the average double layer current on frequency dependence. The average double layer current is also maximal at SOC between 75 and 100%. The exchange of the constant current polarization with pulse polarization does not change substantially the mechanism and the overvoltage of the oxygen evolution reaction on the positive plate. The mechanism of the self-discharge of the EDL was also estimated analyzing long-time PPP transients (up to 2 h). It was found that when the PPP is lower than 1.2 V the preferred mechanism of EDL self-discharge is by coupling with the lead sulphate oxidation reaction. At higher values of PPP the EDL self-discharge happens via oxygen evolution. The high faradic efficiency of the pulse charge is due to the chemical oxidation of the Pb(II) ions by the O atoms and OH radicals formed at the oxygen evolution both during the "ON" and "OFF" periods.

In this work, a spontaneous gas-foaming strategy is presented to synthesize cobalt nanoparticles confined in 3D nitrogen-doped porous carbon foams (CoNCF) by simply carbonizing the mixture of citric acid, NH4Cl, and Co(NO3)(2)6H(2)O. Thanks to its particular 3D porous foam architecture, ultrahigh specific surface area (1641 m(2) g(-1)), and homogeneous distribution of active sites (C-N, Co-N-x, and Co-O moieties), the optimized CoNCF-1000-80 (carbonized at 1000 degrees C, containing 80 mg Co(NO3)(2)6H(2)O in precursors) catalyst exhibits a remarkable bifunctional activity and long-term durability toward both ORR and OER. Its bifunctional activity parameter (Delta E) is as low as 0.84 V, which is much smaller than that of noble metal catalyst and comparable to state-of-the-art bifunctional catalysts. When worked as an air electrode catalyst in rechargeable Zn-air batteries, a high energy density (797 Wh kg(-1)), a low charge/discharge voltage gap (0.75 V), and a long-term cycle stability (over 166 h) are achieved at 10 mA cm(-2).									110	7	0	0	2	0	110			1613-6810	1613-6829		WOS:000428797800011	29430832

Herein, ultra-thin N-doped-graphene encapsulated Ni nanoparticles coupled with MoO(2)nanosheets self-supported on 3D nickel foam are synthesized by a hydrothermal method and post-treatment at high temperature. The experimental results and theoretical calculations confirm the electron transfer from Ni to N-doped-graphene at the interface, which can boost the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) performance. It displays Pt-like HER activity, can reach -10 mA cm(-2)with a lower overpotential of 25 mV, and hold at -400 and -1000 mA cm(-2)for 172 h without decline in performance. Meanwhile, it also exhibits good OER performance at large current density and can work for 196 h at 1000 mA cm(-2)without attenuation as the cathode and anode, suggesting superior durability.

The reported optimal Fe dopant concentrations are, however, inconsistent, and the origin of the increased activity due to Fe dopants in mixed oxides has not been identified so far. Here, we combine density functional theory calculations, scanning tunneling microscopy, and OER activity measurements on atomically defined Fe-doped Co oxyhydroxide nanoparticles supported on a gold surface to establish the link between the activity and the Fe distribution and concentration within the oxyhydroxide phase. We find that addition of Fe results in distinct effects depending on its location on edge or basal plane sites of the oxyhydroxide nanoparticles, resulting in a nonlinear OER activity as a function of Fe content. Fe atom substitution itself does not lead to intrinsically more active OER sites than the best Co sites. Instead, the sensitivity to Fe promoter content is explained by the strong preference for Fe to locate on the most active edge sites of oxyhydroxide nanoparticles, which for low Fe concentrations stabilizes the particles but in higher concentrations leads to a shell structure with less active Fe on all edge positions. The optimal Fe content thereby becomes dependent on nanoparticle size. Our findings demonstrate that synthesis strategies that adjust not only the Fe concentration in mixed oxides but also its distribution within a catalyst nanoparticle can lead to enhanced OER performance.									11	0	0	0	0	0	11			1936-0851	1936-086X		WOS:000747115200098	34726375

A Co-containing carbonitride polymer network (CoCN) was selected as a structural-directing template and a hypercross-linked polymer containing S and P, which formed on CoCN skeleton in situ, was used as a cover. After calcination at 450 degrees C for 2 h, an interconnected nanostructure was obtained and showed excellent activity and high stability for electrochemical water splitting. Trace amount of Co and other heteroatoms including N, S, P and the formed Co-N and Co-O species are essential for the impressive catalysis performance. The calcination temperature of 450 degrees C is optimal to the catalysis performance. These results suggest that Co in addition to heteroatom-doped (S, P) carbonitride could be used as a supplement and/or an alternative to noble metal oxides for water splitting.									13	1	0	0	0	0	13			2095-8226	2199-4501		WOS:000432686100004

In this work, we report a low-temperature plasma strategy to prepare Mott-Schottky-type electrodes which contain metal alloy and metal oxide. The as-obtained free-standing electrodes (Co0.72Fe0.28@CoO/CP and Ni3Fe@NiFe2O4/CP) exhibit remarkable electrochemical performance for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER). After introducing the precious metal Pt, the ORR activity of these electrodes has improved, and the corresponding zinc-air batteries show good charge-discharge efficiency and stability. This outstanding electrochemical performance could attribute to the Mott-Schottky synergistic effects between metal alloy and metal oxide in heterojunction, high conductivity of carbon paper, and interface defects made by Plasma treatment, thus improving the intrinsic electrocatalytic activity of the oxygen reaction.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2365-6549			WOS:000834502800001

In this work, an efficient bifunctional oxygen catalyst comprising hollow Co3O4 nanospheres embedded in nitrogen-doped carbon nanowall arrays on flexible carbon cloth (NC-Co3O4/CC) is reported. The hierarchical structure is facilely derived from a metal-organic framework precursor. A carbon onion coating constrains the Kirkendall effect to promote the conversion of the Co nanoparticles into irregular hollow oxide nanospheres with a fine scale nanograin structure, which enables promising catalytic properties toward both OER and ORR. The integrated NC-Co3O4/CC can be used as an additive-free air cathode for flexible all-solid-state zinc-air batteries, which present high open circuit potential (1.44 V), high capacity (387.2 mAh g(-1), based on the total mass of Zn and catalysts), excellent cycling stability and mechanical flexibility, significantly outperforming Pt- and Ir-based zinc-air batteries.									321	30	0	0	11	0	326			0935-9648	1521-4095		WOS:000415905200024	29024075

Here, the electrocatalytic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activities at porous Pt layers with pore dimensions in the microporous range were examined. The OER activity of the porous Pt layers in acidic media increased as the porosity of the Pt layers increased, and the highest OER activity possessed an overpotential that was 270 mV lower than that of a bulk flat electrode. The porous Pt layers did not exhibit electrocatalytic enhancement for OER in basic media, wherein the surface area of the pores was not utilized for OER. The differentiated OER activity of the porous Pt layers demonstrated the different accessibility of reactants in OER: water and hydrated hydroxide ions. The roles of the pores in the Pt layers during OER were investigated using different Pt structures. The work will give insight into the electrochemistry of microporous electrode structures.									10	0	0	0	2	0	10			2045-2322			WOS:000415022900018	29133870

We also confirmed that the e(g) orbital occupancy at the B site of delafossites, calculated from the bulk structure, had a good accordance with the catalytic activity of those materials.

The preparation of efficient OER electrocatalysts requires both the adsorption sites and charge transfer on the catalyst surface to be suitably engineered. Herein, the design of an electrocatalyst is reported with significantly enhanced water oxidation performance via dual-phase engineering, which displays a high number of adsorption sites and facile charge transfer. More importantly, a simple chemical etching process enables the formation of a highly metallic transition boride phase in conjunction with the transition metal hydroxide phase with abundant adsorption sites available for the intermediates formed in the OER. In addition, computational simulations are carried out to demonstrate the water oxidation mechanism and the real active sites in this engineered material. This research provides a new material design strategy for the preparation of high-performance OER electrocatalysts.									35	2	0	0	2	0	35			1616-301X	1616-3028		WOS:000550664900001

In this study, a sequenced successive ionic layer adsorption and reaction (sequenced-SILAR) method was developed for the fabrication of Ni(OH)(2)/FeOOH heterostructures. In this method, the order of the deposition cycles of individual Ni(OH)(2) and FeOOH layers was programmed to control the thickness and stacking order of these layers in the heterostructure. The sequenced-SILAR process using an Fe2+ solution as the iron source produced dense heterojunctions offering overpotentials of 330 and 234 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) for an oxygen evolution reaction (OER) on a flat, conducting oxide substrate and porous Ni foam, respectively. Investigation of the deposition-sequence-dependent OER activity indicated that the Ni(OH)(2)/FeOOH coupling effects may extend to the Ni2+ active sites located about 10 nm from the heterointerface. When an Fe3+ precursor was employed in the sequenced-SILAR process, dense heterojunctions were not produced because of the formation of isolated FeOOH particles. As a result, an excellent overpotential was not obtained. In principle, the sequenced-SILAR method can be extended to the fabrication of various types of heterostructures. However, the deposition conditions must be carefully designed to offer strong interfacial coupling effects.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			2574-0962			WOS:000688250200086

However, low conductivity and inaccessible active sites severely hinder its application in water electrolysis. Herein, a self-supporting electrocatalyst by developing MOF derivative on the surface of iron foam (IF) was synthesized through a self-templated partial transformation strategy. In addition, a series of catalysts with different morphologies were synthesized by adjusting the amount of Ni and the reaction time. Profiting from the unique hierarchical structure with large active area and abundant active sites, strong combination of highly active amorphous NiFe-LDH and Fe-MOF, and high conductivity and stability of the MOFs array in situ growth on IF, the resulting NiFe-LDH@Fe-MOF/ IF-2 shows excellent oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity in alkaline electrolyte with required overpotentials of 183, 237 and 257 mV to achieve current densities of 10, 100, and 200 mA cm-2, respectively, and long-term stability for at least 20 h.

The prepared Ru0.8Co0.2O2-x samples are of the rutile structure. their chemical composition, however. differs. The samples with the smallest particle size compensate for the Co doping by oxygen deficiency. The materials featuring bigger particle size show tendency to compensate for the presence of cobalt by higher valency of Ru. Regardless of the particle size or actual surface composition of the Ru0.8Co0.2O2-x electrodes, the chlorine evolution precedes that ofoxygen by ca. 100 mV. The Ru0.8Co0.2O2-x electrodes retain high affinity to oxygen evolution once the reaction becomes possible. This behavior can be ascribed to a stabilization of the six-valent ruthenium, which represents the major intermediate for the oxygen evolution process, at the electrode surface due to the presence of di-valent and tri-valent cobalt. This effect precludes the possible effects of the particle shape and crystal edge distribution. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

Herein, we propose a heterogeneous bimetallic phosphide/sulfide nanocomposite electrocatalyst of NiFeSP on nickel foam (NiFeSP/NF), which shows superior electrocatalytic activity of low overpotentials of 91 mV at -10 mA cm(-2) for HER and of 240 mV at 50 mA cm(-2) for OER in 1 M KOH solution. In addition, the NiFeSP/NF presents excellent overall water splitting performance with a cell voltage as low as 1.58 V at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2). Combining with a photovoltaic device of a Si solar cell or integrating into photoelectrochemical (PEC) systems, the bifunctional NiFeSP/NF electrocatalyst implements unassisted solar-driven water splitting with a solar-to-hydrogen conversion efficiency of similar to 9.2% and significantly enhanced PEC performance, respectively.									132	5	0	0	3	0	132			1936-0851	1936-086X		WOS:000413992800075	28898052

Despite the tremendous efforts towards engineering electrode schemes for increasing exposed surface areas and active sites, improving intrinsic catalytic activity still remains a great challenge. Here, we develop a surface-polyaniline (PANI) functionalized nickel selenide (NiSe-PANI) electrode with great performance enhancement for both the HER and OER. The decorated PANI layer subtly modulates the surface electronic structures of NiSe, with a surface-optimized selenium-enriched configuration for the HER and enhanced generation of Ni-III/IV active species when oxidized for the OER. When used as a bifunctional electrocatalyst for overall water splitting, the NiSe-PANI electrode displays excellent performance, with a current density of approximate to 10 mA cm(-2) at an applied voltage of 1.53 V during a long-term electrolysis test, and outperforms the Pt and IrO2 combination as the benchmark and most of the earth-abundant material-based bifunctional catalysts. Similar PANI-functionalization on other bifunctional nickel chalcogenide electrodes also exhibits obviously enhanced performance for overall water splitting, demonstrating the wider applicability of intrinsic activity enhancement via a surface electronic modulation strategy.									33	0	0	0	2	0	33				2052-1537		WOS:000443622100015

IrO2 is known to show good stability during the OER however it is not known to be the most active. Thus, significant research has been dedicated to enhance the activity of IrO2 toward the OER. In this study, IrO2 catalysts were synthesized using a modified Adams fusion method. The Adams fusion method is simple and is shown to directly produce nano-sized metal oxides. The effect of the Ir precursor salt to the NaNO3 ratio and the fusion temperature on the OER activity of the synthesized IrO2 electrocatalysts, was investigated. The OER activity and durability of the IrO2 electrocatalysts were evaluated ex-situ via cyclic voltammetry (CV), chronopotentiometry (CP), electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and linear sweep voltammetry (LSV). Physical properties of the IrO2 electrocatalysts were evaluated via X-ray diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA), differential thermal analysis (DTA), and energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS). The results show that the addition of excess NaNO3 during the modified Adams fusion reaction is not a requirement and that higher synthesis temperatures results in IrO2 electrocatalysts with larger particle sizes and reduced electrocatalytic activity.									21	0	0	0	0	0	21			2073-4344			WOS:000467315600017

The co-electrodeposited Co3O4-dpa-C nanosheets on a glassy carbon electrode exhibited a low overpotential of 54 mV to achieve a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) for the HER, much lower than that of pure Co3O4 (324 mV at 10 mA cm(-2)). These results indicate that the molecular Co complex anchored on the surface of Co3O4 acts as the catalytic center and cooperatively promotes the hydrogen evolution reaction at the interface of the Co3O4 support under alkaline conditions.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			2398-4902			WOS:000482057500003

Conventional catalyst-loaded OEEs suffer from high cost, complicated manufacturing and poor durability. Here, we present an OEE consisting of nanostructured nickel-carbon (Ni/C) catalysts and a gas diffusion layer (GDL) that demonstrates good electrocatalytic activity and durability in alkaline media. The Ni/C OEE is developed from one-step pyrolysis of a Ni/2-methylimidazole complex grown on GDL carbon paper. The overpotential of the obtained Ni/C is 390 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2). After 2000 cyclic voltammetric cycles from 1.04 V to 1.88 V vs. RHE, the Ni/C OEE retains 75% of its electrocatalytic activity (in terms of the oxygen evolution current at 1.88 V) which is superior to 20 wt% iridium supported on the carbon OEE. Electrochemical and spectroscopic data suggest in situ generated alpha-Ni(OH)(2)/gamma-NiOOH and beta-Ni(OH)(2)/beta-NiOOH as the redox couples on the Ni/C OEE. The recurrent rejuvenation of Ni (oxy)hydroxide redox couples and good adhesion of Ni/C catalysts to the matrix are some of the reasons to elucidate high efficiency and good durability of the Ni/C OEE.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			2052-1553			WOS:000475394700027

Then the obtained Ir IrO2 nanocomposite is used as a support to prepare Pt/Ir-IrO2 nanocomposite, which has been demonstrated as an excellent bifunctional oxygen catalyst for unitized regenerative fuel cell. X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS), and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) characterizations indicate that ultrafine Ir nanoparticles (NPs) are uniformly dispersed on the surface of IrO2, which provides a conductive network for Pt NPs. Electrocatalytic activity and stability of Pt/Ir-IrO2 are investigated using cyclic voltammetry (CV), linear sweep voltammetry (LSV), and potential cycling techniques on rotating disc electrode (RDE). Results show that the electrocatalytic activity of Pt/Ir-IrO2 towards oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is much higher than that of Pt/IrO2, and the electrocatalytic activity of Pt/Ir-IrO2 towards oxygen evolution reaction (OER) can be comparable to that of Pt/IrO2. Life tests reveal that Pt/Ir-IrO2 exhibits excellent stability. The enhanced ORR activity of Pt/Ir-IrO2 catalyst can be attributed to the improvement in electronic conductivity, and its higher stability can be assigned to the special structure, in which the interaction between Pt NPs and Ir NPs prevents Pt from agglomerating.

GNPs having hydrophobic surfaces exhibit much higher specific capacity than those having hydrophilic surfaces. When lithium nitrate-N,N-dimethylacetamide (LiNO3-DMAc) is used as the electrolyte, the lithium-oxygen battery exhibits a long cycle life, and unwanted side reactions are effectively suppressed. The LiNO3-DMAc electrolyte is more stable than the lithium bis(trifluoromethane)sulfonamide-tetraethylene glycol dimethyl ether electrolyte, as evidenced by high O-2 evolution and low CO2 evolution.

Here we demonstrated a porous nickel-copper phosphide (NiCuP) nano-foam as a bifunctional electrocatalyst for highly efficient total water splitting. Prepared from a bubble-templated electrodeposition method and subsequent low-temperature phosphidization, NiCuP has a hierarchical pore structure with a large electrochemical active surface area. To reach a high current density of 50 mA cm(-2), it requires merely 146 and 300 mV with small Tafel slopes of 47 and 49 mV dec(-1) for HER and OER, respectively. The total water splitting test using NiCuP as both the anode and cathode showed nearly 100% Faradic efficiency and surpassed the performances of electrode pairs using commercial Pt/C and IrO2 catalysts under our test conditions. The high activity of NiCuP can be attributed to (1) the conductive NiCu substrates, (2) a large electrochemically active surface area together with a combination of pores of different sizes, and (3) the formation of active Ni/Cu oxides/hydroxides while keeping a portion of more conductive Ni/Cu phosphides in the nano-foam. We expect the current catalyst to enable the manufacturing of affordable water splitting systems.									84	7	0	0	0	0	84			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000397968400006	28191583

The current status of the research in developing OER catalysts shows that NiFe-based oxygen evolution catalysts(OECs)have been proven as excellent and remarkable candidates for this purpose. But it is critically important to understand the factors that influence their activity and underlying mechanism for the development of state-of-the-art OER catalysts. Therefore, the development of in-situ/operando characterizations is urgently required to detect key intermediates along with active sites and phases responsible for OER. ~(57)Fe Mossbauer spectroscopy is one of the appropriate and suitable techniques for determining the phase structure of catalysts under their electrochemical working conditions, identifying the active sites, clarifying the catalytic mechanisms, and determining the relationship between catalytic activity and the coordination structure of catalysts. In this tutorial review, we have discussed the current status of research on NiFe-based catalysts with particular attention to introduce in detail the knowhow about the development and utilization of in-situ/operando ~(57)Fe Mossbauer-electrochemical spectroscopy for the study of OER mechanism. A brief overview using NiFe-(oxy)hydroxide catalysts, derived from ordered porous metal-organic framework(MOF)material NiFe-PBAs(Prussian blue analogues), as a typical model study case for the OER electrocatalyst and self-designed in-situ/operando ~(57)Fe Mossbauer-electrochemical instrument, has been provided for the better understanding of readers. Moreover, using in-situ/operando ~(57)Fe Mossbauer spectroscopy, the crucial role of Fe species during OER reaction has been explained very well.			近年来,析氧反应(oxygen evolution reaction)中针对高效且具有成本效益的电催化剂开发一直是构筑有效利用可再生能源存储系统和水分解生产清洁氢能燃料的重大障碍。OER过程涉及四电子、四质子耦合并形成氧-氧(O-O)键,因此动力学上进程缓慢。为提升其在水分解产氢及二氧化碳还原反应中的应用,需要开发高效催化剂,降低OER过电位,以减轻能量转换过程中固有的能量损失。研究表明,IrO_2和RuO_2具有较低析氧过电位,但储量低、价格昂贵,大大限制了其在析氧反应中的大规模应用。而Ni-Fe基析氧催化剂在碱性水分解反应中展现了优异的性能,其在水分解过程中的催化机制仍有待进一步研究。为了解决Ni-Fe基催化剂在析氧反应过程中反应位点及催化反应机制等关键问题,迫切需要更先进的原位技术来准确表征,原位追踪催化剂形态变化与电解质/电极之间的界面相互作用的影响。光谱与电化学结合的原位技术可以监测析氧反应过程催化剂自身的变化。目前,已有大量原位光谱技术与电化学进行结合,揭示Ni-Fe基催化剂在OER过程中的反应机理及活性位点,包括原位表面增强拉曼光谱、原位同步辐射X射线吸收光谱、原位紫外-可见光谱、原位扫描电化学显微镜及原位穆斯堡尔光谱等。其中,原位拉曼技术可以观察Ni-Fe催化剂的振动,可以在电解液中施加测试电压条件下监测电化学反应过程中的中间体,从而提供实时反应信息,有助于追踪电化学驱动反应是如何发生的。原位同步辐射技术可以研究OER过程中Ni-Fe催化剂材料的电子结构和局部几何结构的信息,但目前的研究中更多的是探究Ni的价态变化,对Fe的研究信息较少。原位紫外-可见光谱也主要是针对Ni(OH)_2的变化展开研究,逐渐提高施加电位,Ni(OH)_2会向着NiOOH逐渐变化,紫外-可见技术可以追踪Ni-Fe基电催化剂中的金属氧化过程。众多电化学原位光谱技术中,~(57)Fe穆斯堡尔谱因具有超高的能量分辨率,是确定催化剂相结构、鉴定活性位点、阐明催化机理以及确定催化活性与催化剂配位结构之间关系的最佳手段。此外,原位穆斯堡尔光谱技术基于原子核和核外电子的超精细相互作用而给出的同质异能移、四极矩分裂以及有效磁场等针对催化剂中的Fe位点的氧化态、电子自旋构型、对称性和磁性信息进行研究,为Ni-Fe基催化剂在析氧反应中的应用提供强有力的支持。 1957年,德国科学家鲁道夫·路德维希·穆斯堡尔(Rudolf Ludwig Mossbauer)在其27岁时,发现作为晶格谐振子的原子在发射或吸收酌射线时以一定的概率不会改变它们的量子力学状态,而这一酌射线的核共振吸收现象于1961年获得诺贝尔物理学奖,不久后被命名为穆斯堡尔效应。穆斯堡尔效应是来自于无反冲的酌射线吸收和发射的核共振现象,能量Ee处于激发态的原子核(Z质子和N中子)通过产生能量为E酌的酌射线跃迁到能量为Eg的基态,酌射线可能会被处于基态的另一个相同类型的原子核(相同的Z和N)吸收,从而转变为能量Ee的激发态。只有当发射线和吸收线足够重叠时,才能看到共振吸收。原位穆斯堡尔谱在Ni-Fe催化剂析氧反应中应用,首先需要搭建~(57)Fe穆斯堡尔谱仪与电化学工作站联用。标准的穆斯堡尔光谱仪主要由放射源(通常是57Co在Rh或Pd金属基质中用于~(57)Fe穆斯堡尔光谱)、速度传感器、速度校准装置、波形发生器和同步器、酌射线检测系统、多通道分析仪、计算机,并且可选配低温恒温器或高温烘箱,以控制测量过程处于适宜温度。实际测试过程中,穆斯堡尔谱可以通过速度扫描方法生成,利用移动驱动器或速度传感器以特定速度重复移动源或样品(所谓的多普勒运动),同时酌射线连续传输或发射穿过样品并计数在同步通道上。获得穆斯堡尔谱图后,基于穆斯堡尔谱数据库(https://medc.dicp.ac.cn/,由中国科学院大连化学研究所穆斯堡尔效应数据中心从全世界收集的穆斯堡尔谱样品数据),对~(57)Fe穆斯堡尔谱进行分析拟合,对含Fe基材料的物相、价态、自旋态和配位结构进行归因和分析。数据分析拟合主要利用MossWinn数据分析和拟合软件(http://www.mosswinn.com/)。以Ni-Fe氢氧化物催化剂为例,对于原始催化剂,其仅存在一种Fe~(3+)物种,当该催化剂参与OER过程后,可能会存在Fe~(4+),在双峰基础上,拟合结果中则会出现肩峰向负侧移动现象,可以确认高价Fe的存在,例如Fe~(4+)。为充分证明高价Fe的存在,对于Ni-Fe基催化剂的穆斯堡尔谱测试,还需在工况条件下进行原位测试。 20世纪80年代后期,非贵金属氧化物和氢氧化物代替贵金属氧化物阳极催化剂的电解水研究开始受到关注。Corrigan等通过将Fe杂质引入NiO阳极,测试过程中发现OER活性会增加,但后续的研究中对于Fe究竟如何改变Ni基催化剂的OER性能仍旧不清晰。尔后,原位穆斯堡尔谱的引入逐渐揭开Fe在Ni-Fe电催化水分解析氧反应中的作用。为提高测试准确性并保证穆斯堡尔谱信号的稳定,本实验室对原位穆斯堡尔谱装置做了开发和改进。主要包括三部分院(1)穆斯堡尔光谱仪,(2)电化学工作站,以及(3)自主设计的原位OER电化学反应池。在我们的实验室中,使用了具有14.4 keV级酌射线的单线~(57)Fe穆斯堡尔谱放射源57Co(Rh),可以减少电解液中的信号衰减并获得令人满意的信噪比,附带CHI660E电化学工作站。对于常规的OER测试,在室温298 K条件下进行测试,测试前首先用琢-Fe对穆斯堡尔谱仪进行多普勒速度校准,在进行原位穆斯堡尔谱-OER实验之前,电解液用氮气或氩气饱和以去除溶解的氧气。为了保证测试信号的准确性,实验中所使用的电解池不含任何Fe杂质,因此采用了Teflon材料。为避免测试过程中产生的O_2气泡对信号产生干扰,可以采用蠕动泵循环电解液,并且保证测试过程中局部的微反应环境的一致性。对于普通OER测试,仅需要少量催化剂,但对于原位~(57)Fe穆斯堡尔谱测试,只有保证Ni-Fe催化剂中~(57)Fe含量充足的条件下,才可以获得高质量信号。但OER过程中,不建议催化剂载量过高,催化过程中主要是表面催化剂在反应,当样品过厚时,深层样品无法参与析氧反应过程,可能会有部分Fe仍旧维持Fe~(3+)状态。通常,对于常规~(57)Fe穆斯堡尔光谱测量的催化剂,若在制备中使用普通Fe源,则需要Fe含量在5 ~ 10 mg·cm~(-2),这其中仅有~2.2%的自然丰度~(57)Fe同位素,需要长时间监测才可以采集到信号。为保证实验的顺利进行,可以在样品制备过程中直接使用~(57)Fe源,方便快捷采集高质量信号。为了保证样品测试的准确性,在OER开始前,我们可以在同一电解液中,在开路电位(OCP)下,对其进行测试,这一原始样品的测试可与后续施加电位的Ni-Fe催化剂测试结果进行对比。有外加电压测试时,需要保证催化剂处于稳定状态下进行测试,整个测试过程中保持电流密度稳定,这不仅可以保证催化剂的稳定性,还有助于确定催化剂的真实结构。利用原位~(57)Fe穆斯堡尔谱,我们对通过Ni-Fe普鲁士蓝类似物原位拓扑转换获得的Ni-Fe羟基氧化物电催化剂进行了测试。基于原位拉曼技术,我们发现在阳极电位下,Ni-Fe催化剂中琢-Ni(OH)_2相会不可逆转变为酌-NiOOH。原位~(57)Fe穆斯堡尔谱测试结果表明,在较低的施加电位(例如1.22 V和1.32 V vs. RHE)下,Fe在NiFe_(0.2)-O_xH_y中仅处于+3氧化态,其光谱结果与开路电位下NiFe_(0.2)-O_xH_y谱图相似,其中只有一个双峰,两个峰的强度相等,可归因于高自旋Fe~(3+)物种。但随着外加电位增加并达到1.37 V,两个峰的强度开始变得不相等,开始出现一个小的肩峰,其同质异能移(delta)值约为-0.25 mm·s~(-1),可以归属为Fe~(4+)。随着电压的逐渐增加,催化剂中的Fe~(4+)含量逐渐增加。在OER过程中,施加电位1.42 V vs. RHE时,Fe~(4+)含量~ 12%。当施加的电势达到1.57 V时,催化剂中Fe~(4+)的含量进一步增加到约40%。这一实例充分展现了原位~(57)Fe穆斯堡尔谱与Ni-Fe催化OER过程的应用,也体现了NiFe_(0.2)-O_xH_y催化剂原位产生的Fe~(4+)物种的量与其水氧化反应性能呈正相关,进一步加深了对Ni-Fe水氧化催化机理的理解。 Ni-Fe基催化剂因其价格低廉,电催化析氧性能优异,因此成为碱性水分解析氧过程的理想候选者。虽然Ni-Fe基电催化剂表现出优异的OER活性,但缺乏长期稳定性阻碍了其在商业中的应用。因此,充分了解Ni-Fe催化剂的衰减机理,包括形态、组成、晶体结构和活性位点数量的变化,对于设计稳定和高效Ni-Fe催化材料非常重要,充分了解Ni-Fe催化剂在OER过程中的电子结构及其与析氧反应中间体的相互作用尤为重要。原位拉曼及原位紫外-可见光谱可以对Ni-Fe催化剂中的Ni(OH)_2到NiOOH的变化进行深入探究,而原位~(57)Fe穆斯堡尔谱测试则可以揭示Ni-Fe基催化剂中Fe的电子环境及其电子的、结构的和磁性的变化。穆斯堡尔光谱为研究Ni-Fe催化剂中Fe的局部电子结构、局部配位、键合和氧化态的提供了强大技术支撑。最近,穆斯堡尔光谱在电催化领域获得了越来越多的关注,它对于检测不同铁基催化材料中的主要活性位点有着重要作用。						0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1006-3471			CSCD:7214983

Herein, we reported a facile hydrothermal synthesis of various nanostructured cobalt phenylphosphonates. It is found that the number of hydroxyl group of structure-directing reagent is crucial for the construction of 3D hierarchical structures including hierarchical nanosheet flower-like assemblies and nanothorn microsphere. These samples were characterized by scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, infrared, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy techniques. They can act as highly efficient electrocatalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction at neutral pH. Among these, hierarchical cobalt phenylphosphonate nanothorn flowers present excellent performance, affording a current density of 1 mA cm(-2) required a small overpotential of 393 mV. This work offers a new clue to develop high-performance metal phosphonate/phosphate catalysts toward electrochemical water oxidation.

The omission of stoichiometric oxidizers or reducing agents enables a more sustainable route for redox reactions in organic chemistry. Even if it is well-known that every electrochemical oxidation is only viable with an associated reduction reaction and vice versa, the relevance of the counter reaction is often less addressed. In this Review, the importance of the corresponding counter reaction in electro-organic synthesis is highlighted and how it can affect the performance and selectivity of the electrolytic conversion.

The improvement of conductivity and electron-transporting capability for LDH materials remains an enormous challenge yet. Here, we synthesized carbon nanotube supported quaternary FeCoNiW-LDH ultrathin nanosheets with 1 nm thickness via one-pot hydrothermal methods, which exhibit enhanced OER activity due to the synergistic effect of modified CNTs and doped W6+ onto LDH nanosheets catalysts. The loaded carbon nanotubes can directly result in the improved conductivity. In addition, W6+ doping in LDH can modify the electronic structure and further enhance the conductivity of electrocatalysts. FeCoNiW-LDH/CNT exhibits a small overpotential (258 mV) at a current density of 10 mA.cm(-2) and low Tafel slope (41 mV decade(-1) ) towards OER in alkaline solutions, outperforming the noble metal RuO2 catalysts.									7	4	0	0	0	0	9			0254-5861			WOS:000581015600008

By contrast, iron and lead are considered harmful to nickel batteries because they can decrease the overpotentials at the nickel hydroxide electrode. On the other hand, the addition of iron is beneficial to the water electrolysis process. Cobalt can act as antidote to iron and lead in batteries.

Furthermore, MgFe2O4 nanospheres exhibited an overpotential (eta) = 1.09 V, a Tafel slope (b) = 317 mV/dec in regard to alkaline Oxygen Evolution Reaction (OER) electrocatalyst. It also achieved eta = 402 mV and b = 241 mV/dec in regard towards alkaline Hydrogen Evolution Reaction (HER) electrocatalyst. These results signify the suitability of MgFe2O4 nanoparticles for high energy density aqueous supercapacitor and water splitting electrocatalyst applications.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			1567-1739	1878-1675		WOS:000654350800002

But in terms of large-scale production and application, the "manufacturing costs" and "controllability" of NiFe-based catalysts are still the barrier of them. Here we demonstrate how the cationic (Fe3+/Ni2+) concentration of precursor solution-terminated NixFe1-x/Fe2O3/Ni(OH)(2) complexes dictates the durability and activity of the OER via an electrodeposition method. The results indicated that the OER performance and manufacturing costs can be optimized easily with this industrialized method. Specifically, the optimized Ni0.6Fe0.4/Fe2O3/Ni(OH)(2) complex (NFO-0.6) showed the best OER performance of 218 mV overpotential, 122 mV.dec(-1) Tafel slop, 12 h long-term operation with similar to 38% activity loss. The activity evolution tread suggests that the novel stability of NFO-0.6 is probably induced by the surface oxides and the metallic NixFe1-x transforming during long-term operation (NixFe1-x -> Fe2O3/Ni(OH)(2)). Our work thus demonstrates the tunability of NFO-x activity and durability by controlling the cationic (Fe3+/Ni2+) concentration of precursor showing enormous potential to promote the practical application in water splitting.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000793241700002

Layered double hydroxides (LDHs) have shown promising performance in the process of electrochemical water oxidation (a half-reaction for water splitting). Nevertheless, HER properties have not been well released due to the structural characteristics of related materials. Herein, a simple and scalable tactics is developed to synthesize chromium-doped CoFe LDH (CoFeCr LDH). Thanks to oxygen vacancy, optimized electronic structure and interconnected array hierarchical structure, our developed ternary CoFeCr-based layered double hydroxide catalysts can provide 10 mA cm(-2) current density at -0.201 V vs. RHE with superior long-term stability in alkaline electrolyte. We anticipate that the simple but feasible polymetallic electronic modulation strategy can strengthen the electrocatalytic property of the layered double hydroxides established in the present study, based on a carbon neutral and hydrogen economy.									9	0	0	0	1	0	9				2079-4991		WOS:000781786500001	35407346

For this purpose, metal oxides (M -O) are viewed as a potential competitor in this search because of their high redox potential. Still, their low conductivity and instability are two significant barriers that must be addressed. In this study the nanocomposite of NiAl2O4 with graphene oxide (GO) as a highly effective and long-lasting electrocatalyst for OER has been fabricated. In an alkaline (1.0 M KOH) medium, the GO/NiAl2O4 responds to a very sharp overpotential of 219 mV at a current density of 10 mA/cm2 and with a lower value of tafel slope (43 mV/dec) as compared to its counterparts. The GO/NiAl2O4 corresponds to the high stability of 18 h with retained crystal structure and morphology. For the expected prolonged OER process, we assume the active redox couple due to the presence of Ni thorn 2/ thorn 3 metal in NiAl2O4 varies periodically. Furthermore, the synergistic effect of NiAl2O4, com-bined with the GO, facilitates the dynamics of O2 evolution as a final product, and are useful for further applications in future era.(c) 2022 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC.

The potential-induced pitting corrosion of such electrodes is confirmed by a variety of experimental techniques, including scanning electron microscopy (SEM), time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry (ToF-SIMS), and operando scanning flow cell-inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (SFC-ICP-MS). The structure of the pits is reminiscent of a cylinder (evidenced by focused ion beam scanning electron microscopy: FIB-SEM), where the inner surface of the pits is covered by hydrous RuO2 (cyclic voltammetry, ToF-SIMS) that is formed by electrochemical oxidation of the metallic Ru(0001) substrate. The time evolution of the corrosion process at a fixed electrode potential (1.48 V vs. SHE) is followed via cyclic voltammetry and SEM. The passivating IrO2(110) layer results in an "induction period" for the pit growth that is followed by rapid corrosion of the RuO2(110)/Ru(0001) substrate. The observed narrow and time-independent size distribution relative to the mean size of the pits is attributed to a sluggish removal of the corrosion products by diffusion across the cracks of the pits covering IrO2 layer, leading to steady state corrosion during a total polarization time of 20 to 60 minutes.									17	0	0	0	0	0	17			1867-3880	1867-3899		WOS:000502145700001

Constructing highly -efficient electrocatalysts with superior properties plays an essential role in industrial hydrogen production. In this work, a novel electrocatalyst with a distinctive three-dimensional (3D) structure is constructed by inter-twining two-dimensional (2D) hexagonal NiCo hydroxide nanosheets (NiCo HNS) with one-dimensional (1D) carbon nanotubes (CNTs). The strategy of elemental doping engineering is employed to further enhance the catalytic performance. The as-fabricated composite of Mn-doped nickel cobalt hydroxide nanosheets intertwined with CNTs (1.5Mn-NiCo HNS/CNT) delivers superior OER electrocatalytic performance, which requires an overpotential of only 239 mV to achieve the current density of 10 mA cm-2 in 1 M KOH. Compared to NiCo HNS/ CNT, the 1.5Mn-NiCo HNS/CNT electrocatalyst exhibits characteristics of improved electrical conductivity, larger electrochemical active surface area (ECSA), and faster reaction kinetics due to Mn doping. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations revealed that the adsorption of OH- during the first step of OER process was the potential determining step for the Mn substituted Co sites, and the Mn substituted Co sites were the optimum reactive sites that determined the OER performance of the 1.5Mn-NiCo HNS/CNT. Mn doping was proved beneficial to optimize the reaction path and decrease the reaction kinetics energy barrier. The addition of urea or hydrazine into the electrolyte directly decreases the energy consumption and realize their decomposition as pollutants in industrial and agricultural wastewater.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000871061500003

The as-synthesized products were characterized by powder X-ray diffraction, energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, Raman spectra, scanning electron microscopy, and transmission electron microscopy. The morphology of the CoSe2 on the RGO nanosheets can be well controlled by adjusting the reaction time during the hydrothermal process. The catalytic activities of the RGO/CoSe2 nanocomposites were investigated for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in alkaline conditions. It was found that the as-formed RGO/CoSe2 nanocomposites show higher catalytic activity compared with the unsupported CoSe2. In addition, the loading amounts and morphologies of CoSe2 on RGO sheets have a great influence on the catalytic performance of RGO/CoSe2. Our studies raise promising possibilities for designing effective OER electrocatalysts for energy conversion.

Highly porous three-dimensional oxide supported can serve as an ideal platform to confine ultrasmall metal catalysts on specific sites and modulate their reactivity, resulting in the reduction of noble metal content in the catalyst by boosting the mass activity. However, due to poor control over the support morphology, geometric-driven shifts in mass activity of metal-oxide support catalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction in acidic media have not been realized. Herein, a nanoscale Kirkendall effect is exploited to produce and control a structural evolution yielding an oxygen-evolving catalyst that is highly efficient and robust in acidic medium. By selective reaction-diffusion under oxidizing conditions, the starting solid CoIr NC is directly transformed into an unprecedented Ir-Co3O4@Co3O4 porous-core@shell hollow nanospheres (ICO PCSHS), in which an ultrasmall Ir catalyst is spatially isolated within a porous Co3O4-backbone core, encapsulated by a hollow Co3O4 outer shell. With a low Ir content of 14 wt %, the iridium mass activity exhibited by ICO PCSHS-400 catalyst is 24 times higher than that of benchmark RuO2, substantially exceeding the known oxide-supported metal catalysts. More importantly, the electrocatalyst shows high stability during 8 h of continuous testing in acidic medium.									15	0	0	0	1	0	15			2168-0485			WOS:000489986400088

Particularly, active and stable water splitting electrocatalysts operating in the same electrolyte are required to enhance the overall efficiency and reduce the costs. Here we report a precise and facile synthesis method to control nitrogen active sites for producing nitrogen doped multi-walled carbon nanotube (NMWNT) with high activity toward both oxygen and hydrogen evolution reactions (OER and HER). The NMWNT shows an extraordinary OER activity, superior to the most active non-metal based OER electrocatalysts. For OER, the NMWNT requires overpotentials of only 320 and 360 mV to deliver current densities of 10 and 50 mA cm(-2) in 1.0 M NaOH, respectively. This metal-free electrocatalyst also exhibits a proper performance toward HER with a moderate overpotential of 340 mV to achieve a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) in 0.1 M NaOH. This catalyst also shows high stability after long-time water oxidation without notable changes in the structure of the material. It is revealed that the electron-withdrawing pyridinic N moieties in the NMWNTs could serve as the active sites for OER and HER. Our findings open up new avenues for the development of metal-free electrocatalysts for full water splitting. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

Here, it is shown that Tremella fuciformis (Tfu), possessing an abundant porous structure and favorable metal affinity, is favorably serves as a precursor for confining uniform metal nanoparticles, by comparing the chemical characteristics of six varieties of agarics. The modest size of Co in the Tfu derived composite, Co@NPC-Tfu (NPC = N, P co-doped carbon), is suitable for in situ semi-oxidation during oxygen evolution reaction (OER), forming a stable core-shell structure of Co3O4@Co. Thus, Co@NPC-Tfu can be used as a state-of-the-art electrocatalyst for OER with an overpotential of 213.6 +/- 4.1 mV at 10 mA cm(-2), and a significant turnover frequency of 3.21 s(-1) at 300 mV, benefitting from the optimum trade-off between the atom utilization and electrical conductivity. Operando spectroscopy and theoretical calculations unveil the occupied state modulation of the robust carbon-bonded POx groups, which optimizes the intermediate adsorption to accelerate OER kinetics. Moreover, Tfu derived Ni@NPC-Tfu can be also prepared as a high-performance hydrogen evolution reaction electrocatalyst, which can be utilized for efficient overall water splitting coupled with Co@NPC-Tfu.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1616-301X	1616-3028		WOS:000775766700001

Here, an intentionally designed self-supporting electrode consisting of NiCoP nanowire arrays embedded in 3D integrated N-doped carbon network (NiCoP@NC-NCNTs) is fabricated for high-performance electrocatalytic OER. The NiCoP@NC-NCNTs has been prepared via in-situ growth of N-doped carbon nanotubes (NCNTs) and N-doped carbon (NC) layer on NiCo arrays and subsequent phosphating reaction. Due to the intertwined network structure of NCNTs and the conformal coating of NC layer on the surface of NiCoP arrays, the NiCoP@NC-NCNTs catalyst not only realizes effective charge migration on the whole electrode, but also offers abundant catalytic active sites. Compared to NiCoP nanowire arrays without embedding in 3D carbon network, the NiCoP@NC-NCNTs exhibits a remarkable performance for electrocatalytic OER, in terms of an ultralow overpotential of 227 mV at 10 mA cm(-2), and 317 mV even at 100 mA cm(-2). Meanwhile, a negligible current degradation can be found in the chronoamperometric (i-t) curve after the long-term stability test.

Herein, a bifunctional electrocatalyst is synthesized via electroless plating of FeCoNiP nanoparticles on self-supported phosphorus-doped vertically aligned graphene arrays (FeCoNiP/P-VG). FeCoNiP/P-VG exhibits an exceptionally high catalytic activity for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in a wide pH range, with an overpotential of 81 and 141 mV for HER, and 240 and 409 mV for OER, in 1.0 M KOH and 0.5 M H2SO4 respectively, at current density of 10 mA. It also performs quite low Tafel slope value of 40 mV.dec(-1) for HER and 69 mV.dec(-1) for OER in 1.0 M KOH. More importantly, it shows prominent stability in acidic and alkaline electrolytes. This study may open a new avenue for the design and fabrication of self-supported bifunctional electrocatalysts for water splitting.									10	0	0	0	0	0	10			1738-8090	2093-6788		WOS:000604534000001

Here, Ni1-xMox nanosheets are obtained on carbon cloth (CC), which can be multi-functional electrodes for electrochemical applications. Impressively, we find that the electrochemical abilities can be optimized by constructing network-like nanosheets and tuning the ratio of Ni and Mo in the alloy. To acquire a current density of 10 mAcm(-2) (j(10)), Ni0.75Mo0.25/CC shows the lowest overpotentials (79 mV for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and 330mV for oxygen evolution reaction (OER)) in 1M KOH. Using Ni0.75Mo0.25/CC as both positive and negative poles, the cell only requires a potential of 1.74V to reach j(10) and shows long-term durability. We further show that Ni0.75Mo0.25 electrode exhibits a superior specific capacitance (422Fg(-1) at 1Ag(-1)) and high capacitance retention (108.2% after 1000cycles) in 1M KOH. The super-electrochemical performances of Ni0.75Mo0.25/CC is attributed to its high electronic conductivity, rich active sites, and large surface area. We believe that the Ni0.75Mo0.25/CC electrode with extraordinary electrochemical performances is a hopeful material for practical applications in both electrocatalysis and supercapacitors (SC).									12	0	0	0	0	0	12			2196-0216			WOS:000462598900008

Although a significant improvement in the HER activity was observed, much less effort has been made to realize the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) properties from MC. In this work, we propose controlled charge transfer from cobalt to MC, leading to an unprecedented OER performance. Electron transfer from Co to Mo was established by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and X-ray absorption near-edge spectroscopy (XANES) analyses. The optimized electrocatalyst, MoCo1.5C-700, showed a low overpotential of 232.5 mV to achieve a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) and a small Tafel slope of 61 mV dec(-1) for the OER in an alkaline medium. The electrocatalyst exhibited excellent durability for over 27 h at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2). Density functional theory (DFT) calculation proved favorable adsorption of the OER intermediates (*OH and *O) over Co-incorporated MC that facilitated the formation of *OOH, which led to an accelerated O-2 evolution. In addition, the electrocatalyst displayed superb HER performance, which was confirmed by an overpotential of 96.5 mV to attain a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) in 1.0 M KOH. We anticipate that our work will open up new ways to develop efficient and noble metal-free electrocatalysts for overall water splitting.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000612470000041

In this work, ultrafine NiCoP nanoparticles decorated on N,S,P-codoped hierarchical porous carbon nanosheets (NiCoP/NSP-HPCNS) were fabricated via a simple yet effective pyrolysis strategy. Herein, thiourea and phytic acid (PA) served as S and P sources, cobalt acetate (CA) and nickel phthalocyanine (NiPc) as the metal, C and N precursors. The NiCoP/NSP-HPCNS displayed extraordinary enhancement in oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), with a half-wave potential of 0.84 V (vs. RHE) and enhanced limiting current density of 6 mA cm(-2) in 0.1 M KOH, outperforming commercial Pt/C (0.84 V vs. RHE and 5.1 mA cm(-2)). Furthermore, the catalyst exhibited outstanding catalytic performance for oxygen evolution reaction (OER), with a low overpotential of 299 mV at the current density of 10 mA cm(-2) in 1 M KOH. This work opens up a new avenue to prepare highly effective, low cost and bifunctional electrocatalysts for sustainable energy applications.									71	1	0	0	1	0	71				2052-1537		WOS:000482454500015

Here, we report a high-performance bifunctional oxygen electrocatalyst by confining cobalt (Co) nanoparticles in nitrogen (N)-doped porous carbon cages derived from a metalorganic framework, i. e., ZIF-8. Co precursors were first impregnated into ZIF-8 by a double solvent method. Afterward, carbonization produces highly dispersed Co nanoparticles (with the average diameter of 6.2 nm) confined in N (11.4 at.%) doped porous carbon cages (434.5 m2g 1). This electrocatalyst exhibits excellent catalytic activity for both ORR and OER with long-term stability. It delivers a half-wave potential of 0.838 V vs. reversible hydrogen electrode, an electron transfer number of 3.9 for ORR, an overpotential of 0.411 V at 10 mAcm 2, and a Tafel slope of 71.2 mVdec 1 for OER. Rechargeable Zn-air batteries assembled using this electrocatalyst demonstrate an open-circuit potential of 1.48 V, a specific capacity of 731.1 mAhg 1, and good rechargeability. The simple and efficient method can confine metal nanoparticles in porous carbon cages, which can be further explored to synthesize novel electrocatalysts for various energy conversion applications.									9	0	0	0	0	0	9				2566-6223		WOS:000477087800008

However, the unitary electronic structures and transfer channels always limit their catalytic activities during the OER process. Thus, the precise and favorable structural manipulation at the molecular level will be important to improve the electrocatalysis performance over MOF catalysts. Herein, the advantages of metal hydroxides are integrated into MOFs to design bimetallic hydroxide-mimicking MOFs. With one-dimensional (1D) Brucite [FeCo(OH)(2)] ribbon as the building block, bimetallic MOF (SNNU-FeCo-B) was produced. This type of inbuilt 1D ribbon was facilely evolved to 1D Goethite fragment (FeCoOOH) via changing the alkaline solutions and metal salts. And then SNNU-FeCo-G MOF that inserted the 1D Goethite ribbon was generated. Benefiting from the 1D ribbon-like hydroxide fragments in MOF's frameworks, SNNU-FeCo-B and -G both exhibited much better OER catalytic reactivity compared to the original inorganic metal hydroxides. More importantly, we also demonstrate the 1D Goethite fragment is more favorable to enhance the electron transport capability, increase reactive areas and metal sites and thus exhibit higher electrocatalysis ability. Overall, this work opens a new structural design prospect to develop high-performance MOF electrocatalysts by regulating the MOF microstructure at the molecular level.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0022-4596	1095-726X		WOS:000600992000062

We report a three-dimensional self-supported Cu3P nanobush (NB) catalyst directly grown on a copper mesh via a one-step method. This nanostructure exhibits a superior catalytic activity of achieving a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at 120 mV and exhibits a long-term stability in acid solutions. It shows a Tafel slope of 72 mV dec(-1) and an onset potential of -44 mV. This catalyst displays a good catalytic activity in basic electrolytes, reaching a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at the overpotential values of 252 and 380 mV for HER and OER, respectively. The bifunctional Cu3P NB/Cu catalyst exhibits better catalytic performances than the Pt/C and IrO2 catalysts in a two-electrode electrolyzer for overall water splitting.									78	2	0	0	1	0	78			2470-1343			WOS:000392721200032	31457202

However, the rational design of low-cost electrocatalysts with excellent catalytic activity and long-term durability toward the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) remains a significant challenge. Herein, we reported a systematic density functional theory (DFT) study on the screening of FeS2-supported transition metal single atoms (M@FeS2) as electrocatalysts for the HER and OER. The results indicate that M@FeS2 catalysts exhibit excellent thermal stability and good electrical conductivity for electrochemical reactions. Transition metal atoms are identified as the active sites for the HER and OER. Cr@FeS2 and V@FeS2 exhibit excellent catalytic activity towards the HER. In particular, Cr@FeS2 has a Delta G(H*) value of 0.049 eV and presents a lower activation energy barrier of 0.22 eV for the HER. The HER activity of Cr@FeS2 is even higher than that of the current most efficient Pt catalysts. Mn@FeS2 shows good OER activity and is expected to be a promising candidate for OER electrocatalysts. This work could pave a new way to design cost-effective electrocatalysts for the HER and OER, and also shed light on the application of FeS2-based materials in water splitting.									24	0	0	0	2	0	24			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000614172600046

Among the SACs, the carbon-supported SACs have been widely investigated due to their easily controlled properties of the carbon substrates, such as the tunable morphologies, ordered porosity, and abundant anchoring sites. The electrochemical performance of carbon-supported SACs is highly related to the morphological structure of carbon substrates (macro-environment) and the local coordination environments of center metals (micro-environment). This review aims to provide a comprehensive summary on the macro/micro-environment regulating carbon-supported SACs for highly efficient hydrogen/oxygen conversion reactions. The authors first summarize the macro-environment engineering strategies of carbon-supported SACs with altered specific surface areas and porous properties of the carbon substrates, facilitating the mass diffusion kinetics and structural stability. Then the micro-environment engineering strategies of carbon-supported SACs are discussed with the regulated atomic structure and electronic structure of metal centers, boosting the catalytic performance. Insights into the correlation between the co-boosted effect from the macro/micro-environments and catalytic activity for hydrogen/oxygen conversion reactions are summarized and discussed. Finally, the challenges and perspectives are addressed in building highly efficient carbon-supported SACs for practical applications.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			1613-6810	1613-6829		WOS:000827193300001	35853722

Herein, a novel bifunctional electrocatalyst composed of CoP and Ni2P nanoparticles implanted in a hollow porous N-doped carbon polyhedron (CoP/Ni2P@HPNCP) is synthesized by carbonization of Co/Ni-layered double hydroxide@zeolitic imidazolate framework-67 (Co/Ni-LDH@ZIF-67) followed by an oxidation and phosphorization strategy. The introduction of LDH can not only promote the formation of a hollow porous structure to supply more active sites, but also generate the CoP/Ni2P nanoheterostructure to afford extra active sites and modulate the electronic structure of the catalyst. As a result, CoP/Ni2P@HPNCP exhibits excellent pH universal hydrogen evolution reaction activity and alkaline oxygen evolution reaction activity. Furthermore, the electrolytic cell assembled from bifunctional CoP/Ni2P@HPNCP requires a cell voltage of 1.59 V in 1.0 M KOH at 10 mA cm(-2), revealing its potential as a high performance bifunctional electrocatalyst.									29	1	0	0	0	0	30			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000597751800048	33237088

In this regards, hydrogen thermal reduction has been demonstrated effective approach in removing the unstable surface oxygen while maintaining the high porosity of carbon matrix. However, the exact evolution mechanism of various oxygen species during this process, as well as the correlation with electrochemical properties, is still under development. Herein, biomass-based porous carbon is adopted as the model material to trace its structure evolution of oxygen removal under hydrogen thermal reduction process with the temperature range of 40 0-80 0 degrees C. The optimum microstructure with low oxygen content of 0.90% and proper pore size distribution was achieved at 700 degrees C. XPS, TPRMS and Boehm titration results indicate that the oxygen elimination undergoes three distinctive stages (intermolecular dehydration, hydrogenation and decomposition reactions). The optimum microstructure with low oxygen content of 0.90% and proper pore size distribution was achieved at 700 degrees C. Benefiting from the stable electrochemical interface and the optimized porous structure, the as-obtained HAC-700 exhibit significantly suppressed self-discharge and leak current, with improved cycling stability, which is attributable to the stabilization of electrochemical interface between carbon surface and electrolyte. The result provides insights for rational design of surface chemistry for high-performance carbon electrode towards advanced energy storage.

Inspired by plant leaves, a 2D/1D CoOx heterostructure is developed that is composed of ultrathin CoOx nanosheets further assembled into a nanotube structure. This bio-inspired architecture allows a highly active Co2+ electronic structure for an efficient oxygen evolution reaction (OER) at the atomic scale, ultrahigh surface area (371 m(2) g(-1)) for interfacial electrochemical reaction at the nanoscale, and enhanced transport of charge and electrolyte over CoOx nanotube building blocks at the micro-scale. Consequently, this CoOx nanosheet/nanotube heterostructure demonstrates a record-high OER performance based on cobalt compounds reported so far, with an onset potential of approximate to 1.46 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE), a current density of 51.2 mA cm(-2) at 1.65 V versus RHE, and a Tafel slope of 75 mV dec(-1).

Such attractive performance resulted from multiple aspects, including the improved electrochemical active surface area, accelerated charge transfer kinetics, increased high-oxidation state of the Co cation within the Co3+/Co4+ redox couple, and enlarged amount of lattice oxygen species. Moreover, the presence of amorphous regions and structure distortion of P-modified BSCF from the ex situ method greatly facilitated the HER. (C) 2020 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC.

Effects of duty cycle on the morphology and phase structure were investigated by scanning electronic microscopy (SEM) and X-ray diffraction (XRD), respectively. The SEM and XRD results show that the decrease of duty cycles decreases the grain size of PbO2 electrodes. The steady-state polarization curves and accelerated life tests demonstrate that the oxygen evolution overpotential and service life of PbO2 electrodes increase with the decrease of duty cycle, the PbO2 electrodes prepared at 20 % duty cycle possess highest oxygen evolution overpotential and service life, and the service life of PbO2 electrodes prepared at 20 % duty cycle reaches 71 h which is almost two times longer than that of the PbO2 electrodes prepared by direct electrodeposition. The bulk electrolysis shows that the methyl orange (MO) degradation on the PbO2 electrodes prepared by pulse electrodeposition is the pseudo-first-order reaction and the chemical oxygen demand and MO removal on PbO2 electrodes increase with the decrease of duty cycle, which can be attributed to the higher oxygen evolution overpotentials and electrochemical active surface area of PbO2 electrodes.									8	0	0	0	0	0	8			1432-8488	1433-0768		WOS:000332487200014

One of the best methods to store surplus energy produced from environmentally friendly methods is as elemental hydrogen, using electrolysis in alkaline electrolyzers. Currently, this technology is hampered by the sluggish oxygen evolution reaction (OER), which limits its overall efficiency and durability. One of the most popular directions is to develop cheap, durable, and active platinum-group-metal-free (PGM-free) catalysts. In this category, the benchmark catalyst is NiFeOOH. Here, synthetic, electrochemical, spectro-scopic, and theoretical methods were used to design, synthesize, and investigate novel PGM-free catalysts with enhanced durability and activity. Using an easy and cheap one-step synthetic precipitation method, titanium atoms in various amounts were introduced in the NiFeOOH structure, forming NixFeyTizOOH. One of these compounds (Ni:Fe:Ti = 85.75:7.70:6.55) shows a very low overpotential on GC (400 mV, at a current density of 10 mA/cm(2)) and high current density (27.9 mA cm(-2)) at a potential of 1.8 V vs RHE. This is a higher activity toward the OER in comparison to the benchmark catalyst; in addition, the compound has higher stability at prolonged exposure to high potentials.									17	0	0	0	1	0	17			2155-5435			WOS:000530090800005

NiFe alloys were electrodeposited and anodized to form a porous electrocatalytic layer. This approach produces highly active electrodes without the need for noble metals, binders, or conductive carbon additives. The as-anodized electrode initially exhibits poor OER activity in 1.0 mol dm(-3) KOH; however, the effects of potential cycling improve the OER activity to an extent that an overpotential as low as 0.26 V at 10 mA cm(-2) is observed for the anodized Ni-11.8 at. % Fe electrode. Although significant in situ activation is achieved with anodized NiFe electrodes, this activation is less significant for as-deposited NiFe or anodized Ni electrodes. Furthermore, OER activity is observed to be composition-dependent, with the Ni-11.8 at. % Fe electrode exhibiting the greatest activity. A porous fluoride-rich, Fe-doped Ni oxyfluoride layer produced by anodizing is converted via potential cycling to an amorphous or poorly crystalline Fe-doped Ni(OH)(2) layer with a nanoflake-like morphology. The high activity is maintained even after the removal of most of the fluoride. Thus, the F-rich, Fe-doped Ni oxyfluoride is a promising precursor to develop a highly active OER electrode.									14	0	0	0	0	0	14			2574-0962			WOS:000618839200087		
J	Qian, Guangfu; Chen, Jinli; Yu, Tianqi; Liu, Jiacheng; Luo, Lin; Yin, Shibin								Three-Phase Heterojunction NiMo-Based Nano-Needle for Water Splitting at Industrial Alkaline Condition								NANO-MICRO LETTERS				14	1					20	10.1007/s40820-021-00744-x				2022	2022	Constructing heterojunction is an effective strategy to develop high-performance non-preciousmetal-based catalysts for electrochemical water splitting (WS). Herein, we design and prepare an N-doped-carbon-encapsulated Ni/MoO2 nano-needle with three-phase heterojunction (Ni/MoO2 @CN) for accelerating the WS under industrial alkaline condition. Density functional theory calculations reveal that the electrons are redistributed at the three-phase heterojunction interface, which optimizes the adsorption energy of H- and O-containing intermediates to obtain the best AG H . for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and decrease the AG value of rate-determining step for oxygen evolution reaction (OER), thus enhancing the HER/OER catalytic activity. Electrochemical results confirm that Ni/MoO2@CN exhibits good activity for HER (eta(-)(10)=33 mV, eta(-)(1000) =267 mV) and OER (eta(10) =250 mV, eta(1000) =420 mV). It shows a low potential of 1.86 V at 1000 mA cm(-2) for WS in 6.0 M KOH solution at 60 degrees C and can steadily operate for 330 h. This good HER/OER performance can be attributed to the three-phase heterojunction with high intrinsic activity and the self-supporting nano-needle with more active sites, faster mass diffusion, and bubbles release. This work provides a unique idea for designing high efficiency catalytic materials for WS.									25	0	0	0	3	0	25			2311-6706	2150-5551		WOS:000728578300002	34882293

The oxygen bubbles do not conduct electricity, thus increasing the electrolyte resistance. The oxygen bubbles formed at the anode rise to the surface, occupying a larger volume of the electrolyte at the top of the cell than at the bottom. This oxygen bubble concentration gradient contributes to a gradient in electrolyte resistance and consequently a tendency toward uneven current distribution. This phenomenon increases the chance for uneven growth on the cathode and/or short-circuits, particularly on the lower portions of the cathode. This issue may be ameliorated by increasing the charge transfer resistance for oxygen evolution down the height of the anode. This concept was studied by solving the current distribution for a 2-D model of a copper electrowinning cell using COMSOL.

Here our group demonstrated the synthesis, characterization and electrochemical performance of highly effective and versatile cobalt oxide nanoparticles (Co3O4 NP's) layered on fluorinated tin oxide (FTO) for efficient water splitting strategy. The synthesized Co3O4 NP's were analyzed by Scanning Electron Microscopy, Particle Size Analyzer, Zeta Potential, X-ray Diffraction, Ultraviolet-Visible Absorption Spectroscopy, Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR) and Raman spectroscopy. The Co3O4 NP's were deposited on FTO using inexpensive as well as leading electro-deposition method and by simple spray method. Hence, prepared Co3O4 electrocatalysts is found to be highly efficient for water oxidation without any pre-conditioning. This Co3O4 electrocatalyst, layered at FTO through electro-deposition method, is first used in Oxygen evolution reactions (OER). Electrochemically deposited Co3O4 NP's at FTO proved itself a better electrode than simple spray-coated Co3O4 NP's at FTO electrode and initiated the oxygen onset potential around 1.49 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) (LATIN SMALL LETTER ENG = 260 mV). The observed Tafel slope was 53 mV dec(-1) during the oxygen evolution reaction and the peak of the current density J/68 mA cm(-2) was observed at 1.78 V versus RHE, which is novel for cobalt-based electrocatalyst system. The conclusions drawn were comparable with both the pricey state of the art IrO2 and RuO2 electrocatalyst systems. In the long term water electrolysis experiment, the electrocatalyst also offered durability and enduring stability. This innovative approach offers a simplest technique to prepare cost-effective and super effectual nanoscale electrocatalyst for water electrolysis.[GRAPHICS].									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			0021-891X	1572-8838		WOS:000617103900001

Nevertheless, the delivery of cobalt sulfide structures with high performance with long-term stability is still a challenge. In the current work reported here, via employing a metal-organic framework (MOF) as the starting material, a simple oxygen-assisted etching strategy to synthesize Co9S8 nanoparticles coated with N-doped few-layer graphene (CS@NFLG) was developed. Microstructure studies show that the graphene layer is doped with the nitrogen element and forms a continuous three-dimensional (3D) conductive network, which protects the inner Co9S8 nanoparticles in the harsh reaction environment and modulates the electronic interactions with the Co9S8 particle surface. Because of the advantages of the unique microstructure, CS@NFLG possesses excellent HER activity in an acidic medium (0.5 M H2SO4) at a low onset overpotential of 50 mV with a small Tafel slope of 73 mV dec(-1). Meanwhile, the sample presents remarkable sodium storage properties in terms of a high reversible capacity, good rate capabilities, and good stability. In particular, the CS@NFLG electrode delivers a specific capacity of 505 mA h g(-1) after 100 cycles at 0.5 A g(-1). Moreover, the CS@NFLG electrode still maintains a high specific capacity of 442.3 mA h g(-1) after 400 cycles at a high current density of 1.2 A g(-1). This work shows that nanoscale "top-down" etching from the bottom is a promising route for the fine modulation of the structure and composition at the electronic and atomic scales, thus showing great prospects for use in energy storage and conversion applications.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			2398-4902			WOS:000686243100001

However, the inferior performance for the cathodic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) limits their wide potential in constructing stable oxide-based alkaline electrolyzers for hydrogen production. Here, we show that the efficient decoration of perovskite oxide (K0.469La0.531)TiO3 (KLTO) via surface ion exchange with Ru cations and nucleation growth of Ti-doped RuO2 (TRO) nanoparticles could form a composite oxide-type electrocatalyst. It enables fast water dissociation with excellent HER activity in alkaline solution, superior to other oxide electrocatalysts and commercial Pt/C. Theoretical and experimental studies imply that the co-existence of surface TRO nanoparticles and the Ru-doped KLTO (RKLTO) substrate synergistically enhances the alkaline hydrogen evolution kinetics. Ti doping into the RuO2 lattice could significantly reduce the barrier of water dissociation to facilitate the Volmer process. The surface doping of Ru in the KLTO substrate could regulate and optimize the hydrogen adsorption free energy. The present strategy represents a new concept for designing oxide-based electrocatalysts related to devices for energy conversion and storage.									23	2	0	0	3	0	22			1754-5692	1754-5706		WOS:000589801000021

In this study, we report a facile strategy to enhance the electrocatalytic activity of CaMnO3 by introducing oxygen defects. The nonstoichiometric CaMnO3-delta (0 < delta <= 0.5) was prepared through thermal reduction of pristine perovskite microspheres and nanoparticles, which were synthesized from thermal-decomposition of carbonate precursors and the Pechini route, respectively. The as-prepared samples were analyzed by chemical titration, structural refinement, thermogravimetric analysis, and energy spectrometry. In 0.1 M KOH aqueous solution, the nonstoichiometric CaMnO3-delta with delta near 0.25 and an average Mn valence close to 3.5 exhibited the highest ORR activity (36.7 A g(-1) at 0.70 V vs RHE, with onset potential of 0.96 V), which is comparable to that of benchmark Pt/C. Density functional theory (DFT) studies and electrical conductivity measurement revealed that the enhanced ORR kinetics is due to facilitated oxygen activation and improved electrical properties. Besides high activity, the nonstoichiometric perovskite oxides showed respectable catalytic stability. Furthermore, the moderate oxygen-defective CaMnO3-delta (delta approximate to 0.25) favored the OER because of the improved electrical conductivity. This study makes nonstoichiometric CaMnO3-delta a promising active, inexpensive bifunctional catalytic material for reversible ORR and OER.									173	9	0	0	7	1	177			0020-1669	1520-510X		WOS:000341229600034	25133744

Layered double hydroxides have great promise, and to fulfill their full potentials requires effective strategies to engineer and stabilize their structures at the nanoscale. In this study, we report the scalable preparation and delamination of atomic-thick CoNi layered double hydroxide nanosheets, and the subsequent flocculation from their colloidal dispersion upon the introduction of negatively charged graphene oxide nanosheets. Thanks to the large surface areas of CoNi layered double hydroxide monolayers and the high electrical conductivity of reduced graphene oxide support, the thus-formed composite exhibits bifunctional activity and stability far more superior to its close competitors for oxygen reduction and oxygen evolution in both 1 M and 6 M KOH. It could also be used as the oxygen electrocatalyst of rechargeable Zn-air batteries to enable remarkable discharge peak power density and stable cycling stability.									37	4	0	0	0	0	37			2405-8297			WOS:000451571200003

Moreover, the existence of multiple metal cations invests a flexible tunability in the host layers; the unique intercalation characteristics lead to flexible ion exchange and exfoliation. Thus, their electrocatalytic performance can be tuned by regulating the morphology, composition, intercalation ion, and exfoliation. However, the poor conductivity limits their electrocatalytic performance, which therefore has motivated researchers to combine them with conductive materials to improve their electrocatalytic performance. Another factor hampering their electrocatalytic activity is their large lateral size and the bulk thickness of LDHs. Introducing defects and tuning electronic structure in LDH-based materials are considered to be effective strategies to increase the number of active sites and enhance their intrinsic activity. Given the unique advantages of LDH-based materials, their derivatives have been also used as advanced electrocatalysts for water splitting. Here, recent progress on LDHs and their derivatives as advanced electrocatalysts for water splitting is summarized, current strategies for their designing are proposed, and significant challenges and perspectives of LDHs are discussed.									365	15	0	0	20	0	366				2198-3844		WOS:000441869400004	30128233

The current researches are limited by the complex synthetic procedures and poor stability of catalysts in practical application. Transition-metal (oxy)hydroxides are promising candidates for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) yet challenging approach to the clean energy by the low electrical conductivity. In this work, we pioneered an atomical-doping engineering strategy for achieving highly efficient and robust electrocatalyst towards large current density. Ag doped NiFe layered double hydroxide (LDH) was prepared by a one-step redox reaction on Ni foam without complex synthetic approach. Benefiting from the increased intrinsic conductivity, abundant active sites, and improved intrinsic surface area, Ag/NiFe LDH present a superior catalytic activity toward large-scale application, requiring low overpotentials of 240 and 276 mV at 100 and 1000 mA cm(-2) in 1 M KOH, respectively. More importantly, a low overpotential of 303 mV at 1000 mA cm(-2) in alkaline seawater-based electrolyte was attained, which remained 1000 h with long-term operation. Experimental and theoretical calculations demonstrated that the oxidation of Ag triggers the lattice oxygen redox and stabilizes the lattice oxygen, which does not induce significant material structure change and reconstruction during operation, ensuring the OER stability. This work remarkably advances the development of seawater electrolysis for large-scale clean energy.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			2211-2855	2211-3282		WOS:000800472200004

An effective electrocatalyst can be prepared by tailoring the composition, morphology, and structure of the material. Herein, we report a CoTe2-NiTe2 heterojunction directly grown on CoNi alloy foam (CNF) via a simple hydrothermal route. The optimized electrode of 3CNT/CNF-240C was achieved through the adjustment of reductant addition of N2H4 center dot H2O and the reaction temperature in the hydrothermal reaction. The 3CNT/CNF-240C electrode only needs a low overpotential of 280 mV to attain an anodic current density of 10 mA cm(-2), and shows fast kinetics for the OER with a small Tafel slop of 19.4 mV dec(-1). The enhanced OER performance could be attributed to the interaction between CoTe2 and NiTe2 in the heterojunctions promoting the charge transfer process. Moreover, 3CNT/CNF-240C also shows excellent long-term stability, which can maintain 18 h of continuous electrolysis without obvious degradation. Our research provides a new strategy for the direct synthesis of integrated hybrid structured electrocatalysts to achieve highly active and durable water splitting.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			2052-1553			WOS:000727435700001

Herein, we present a thermally exfoliated graphene (TEG) confined strategy to construct active edge sites-enriched layered double hydroxides (LDHs) nanosheets for OER. The TEG as spatially confined skeleton that features large specific surface area and open frameworks with hierarchical interspace structure, is capable of resulting in effectively confined and dispersed growth of the CoFe-LDH nanosheets. This also finally endows the as-made CoFe-LDH/TEG architectures with the maximized exposure of the edge sites, open and interconnected conducting networks, together with intimate interaction between LDH nanosheets and conductive TEG substrate. These unique and superior characteristics guarantee that the as-made CoFe-LDH/TEG architectures enable the capability of intensifying the reaction process, such as fast electrolyte ion and electron transfer, finally delivering an enhanced electrocatalytic activity and reaction kinetics.

A single Au nanoparticle of 50-100 nm in diameter was encapsulated within a porous carbon shell embedded with Zn-Fe compounds. The resulting Au@Zn-Fe-C hybrids exhibited apparent catalytic activity for ORR in 0.1 M KOH (with an onset potential of +0.94 V vs RHE, excellent stability and methanol tolerance) and for HER as well, which was evidenced by a low onset potential of -0.08 V vs RHE and a stable current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at only -0.123 V vs RHE in 0.5 M H2SO4. The encapsulated Au nanoparticles played an important role in determining the electrocatalytic activity for ORR and HER by promoting electron transfer to the zinc-iron-embedded porous carbon layer, and the electrocatalytic activity was found to vary with both the loading of the gold nanoparticle cores and the thickness of the metal-carbon shells. The experimental results suggested that metal-embedded porous carbons derived from metal-organic frameworks might be viable alternative catalysts for both ORR and HER.									137	5	0	0	4	0	140			2155-5435			WOS:000369774900064

However, the classical bifunctional electrocatalysts usually show outstanding activity for one half-reaction at the expense of the ability of another half-reaction, thus giving a moderate performance for overall water splitting. In this work, a family of transition-metal nitride heterostructures (MxN@NiMoN, M: Ni, Co and Cu) were synthesized by a general and effective strategy to address the shortcomings of classical bifunctional electrocatalysts. These materials exhibited excellent performances for both hydrogen and oxygen evolution reaction (HER/OER) that were superior or comparable to those of noble metals. Boosted electrocatalytic overall water splitting was also achieved with only a low cell voltage of 1.481 V to drive 10 mA cm(-2). Moreover, the excellent durability of 2 days illustrated superior value in practical applications. This work provides fundamental insight towards designing and optimizing advanced materials for renewable energy applications.									7	0	0	0	0	0	7			1144-0546	1369-9261		WOS:000487373300005

Herein, we demonstrate that the electrochemical activation process of the CoP nanoflower supported on carbon cloth (CoP/CC) can remarkably reduce the OER overpotential by about 123 mV, which only requires an ultralow overpotential of 176 mV at the current density of 10 mA cm(-2). Correspondingly, the voltage of the assembled CoP/CC parallel to CoP/CC electrolyzer is also greatly decreased from 1.64 to 1.49 V at 10 mA cm(-2). We further find that during the OER process, at least a three-step electro-oxidation process occurs on the catalyst surface in different potential ranges: under lower potentials, the ultrathin CoP nanosheets are oxidized to divalent CoO, then further oxidized to trivalent beta-CoOOH under moderate potentials, and even transformed to Co-IV species under high potentials. Such produced oxidized species are favorable to the formation of OOH* active intermediates or directly serve as OOH* active intermediates of the rate-determining step, thus facilitating the OER process. Meanwhile, the generation of porous surfaces, downsizing particles, active intermediate crystal structures, and new interfaces during the OER activation process can also lower the energy barrier, further accelerating the OER process.									36	1	0	0	2	0	36			2168-0485			WOS:000599195300025

Herein, a replacement reaction with Te nanowires (NWs) is employed for the synthesis of ternary RuIrTe nanotubes (NTs) as bifunctional electrocatalysts for overall water splitting in an acidic environment. Depending on the electronic coupling between Ru, Ir and Te elements and abundant active sites provided by the one-dimensional tubular rough surface, the as-obtained RuIrTe NTs exhibit high catalytic activity for overall water splitting in acidic electrolytes. At a current density of 10 mA cm(-2), the RuIrTe NTs display excellent catalytic performance with an overpotential of 29 mV and 205 mV for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER), respectively. The cell voltage of a two-electrode water splitting system composed of bifunctional RuIrTe NTs is only 1.511 V in 0.5 M H2SO4 media.

Herein, we fabricate tungsten-doped Ni-Co phosphides based on Ni foam (W-NiCoP/NF), which have multiple catalytic sites for water dissociation and H-2 formation steps, respectively. Physical and electrochemical studies imply that bimetallic Ni-Co sites are responsible for water dissociation by absorbing hydroxide, while the W atoms function as binding sites for hydrogen intermediates (H-ad) in the second step of the alkaline HER process. Benefiting from the moderate combination ability between W and H atoms, W sites could effectively convert H-ad to H-2, and the synergistic effect between Ni-Co sites and W sites can accelerate the HER rate. W-NiCoP/NF exhibits a low overpotential of 29.6 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) and a small Tafel slope of 38 mV dec(-1), which is close to that of the Pt/C catalyst. W-NiCoP/NF also displays excellent oxygen evolution reaction (OER) performance and thus outstanding performance for overall water splitting. This work may provide a way to modulate multisite catalysts based on transition metal phosphides for wider application in other electrolysis fields.									101	6	0	0	3	0	101			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000476599900024

Herein, we report a one-pot method to fabricate a series of core@shell Ni@RuM (M=Ni or Co) nanocrystals (NCs) with Ni as the core and tunable RuM (M=Ni or Co) as the alloy shell for efficient water-splitting catalysis. Among these core@shell NCs, the obtained Ni@RuNi NCs exhibit the highest intrinsic activity for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and possess an outstanding mass activity of 1590 mA mg(Ru)(-1) at 0.07 V vs. reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE), which is 1.7 times higher than that of commercial Pt/C (950 mA mg(Pt)(-1)). As for oxygen evolution reaction (OER), the prepared Ni@Ru0.4Co0.6 NCs with optimized shell composition achieve more enhanced mass activity of 270 mA mg(Ru)(-1) at 1.56 V vs. RHE, approaching three times higher than that of commercial RuO2 (89 mA mg(Ru)(-1)). The superb mass activity of these Ni@RuM (M=Ni or Co) NCs can be attributed to their core@shell structure and modulated electronic structure through alloying with Ni or Co metal in the shell.									17	5	0	0	0	0	17			2095-8226	2199-4501		WOS:000496593500011

Herein, we report the synthesis of a Co-doped nickel selenide (a mixture of NiSe2 and Ni3Se4)/C hybrid nanostructure supported on Ni foam using a metal-organic framework as the precursor. The resulting catalyst exhibits excellent catalytic activity toward the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), which only requires an overpotential of 275 mV to drive a current density of 30 mA cm(-2). This overpotential is much lower than those reported for precious metal free OER catalysts. The hybrid is also capable of catalyzing the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) efficiently. A current density of -10 mA cm(-2) can be achieved at 90 mV. In addition, such a hybrid nanostructure can achieve 10 and 30 mA cm(-2) at potentials of 1.6 and 1.71 V, respectively, along with good durability when functioning as both the cathode and the anode for overall water splitting in basic media.									232	7	0	0	9	0	233			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000386700600033

For the hydrothermal synthesis reaction, ultrathin nanorod heazlewoodite Ni3S2 catalysts on NF is synthesized by controlling the amount of hydrazine (2 mL) and the processing time/temperatures (150 ? for 12 h). Due to the hierarchically porous nanorod morphologies, Ni3S2@NF under O-2-saturated 1 M KOH aqueous solution shows excellent OER performance, with a low overpotential of 263 mV at a current density of 100 mA & BULL;cm(-2) and a Tafel slope of 72 mV & BULL;dec(-1). Further, Ni3S2@NF shows stable potential behavior at around 1.521 V under the constant current operation of 50 mA cm(-2) for 50 h. Ni3S2@NF also shows negligible performance degradation during the constant current (at 50 mA cm(-2) for 50 h) and voltage cycling (1.25-1.65 V for 1000 cycles) tests in a 1 M KOH solution. The excellent catalytic performance of Ni3S2@NF can be attributed to the hierarchically porous and ultrathin nanorod structures, the multi-valence-state character of Ni element, and the synergistic effect of NF, and high intrinsic catalytic active electrocatalysts for the OER.(c) 2022 Elsevier B.V.

Oxidation of organics in the potential region of O-2 evolution is Supposed to proceed through the oxidation of water to hydroxyl radicals, which then may either be further oxidized to give molecular oxygen or interact with organic molecules in all oxygen-transfer reaction. Therefore. the ideal electrode material must ensure (i) the preferential adsorption of pollutants, (ii) the production of adsorbed hydroxyl radicals able to react with organics in a selective oxidation reaction (with as little as possible oxygen evolution) and (iii) a long term stability of performance.Oxides, mixed oxides and composite oxides are especially promising anode materials in view of their stability under oxidative conditions. PbO2 is one of the most investigated anode materials owing to its large electronic conductivity, chemical stability and low cost. Two basic pathways are envisaged for the optimisation of its properties: homogeneous doping and composite formation. In the present paper, the catalytic activity of PbO2 coatings deposited on Ti from acidic nitrate + fluoride baths containing Pb2+ and Bi3+ towards oxidative decomposition Of toluene in sulphuric acid Solution is investigated by voltammetric and electrochemical impedance spectroscopic measurements. The chemical composition of the obtained catalytic films is characterised by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and their structure and crystallite size by X-ray diffraction. The catalytic activity of the electrodes towards anodic oxidation of toluene in acidic medium is estimated both from current density vs. potential and polarisation resistance vs. potential plots. Measurements oil similar electrodes have been carried out in sulphuric acid without toluene to eliminate the oxygen evolution reaction that proceeds in parallel to the oxidation of toluene. The kinetics of decomposition of toluene at different potentials is followed by UV spectrophotometry. A tentative mechanism of the process is proposed to account for the steady state and transient response of the nanocatalysts during oxidation of toluene.					8th International Scientific Conference on Modern Management of Mine Producing, Geology and Environmental Protection8th International Scientific Conference on Modern Management of Mine Producing, Geology and Environmental Protection	JUN 16-20, 2008JUN 16-20, 2008		Sofia, BULGARIASofia, BULGARIA	0	0	0	0	0	0	0					978-954-91818-1-4	WOS:000275797200008

A strategy for fabricating strongly coupled cobalt phosphide (CoP)/graphene (G) architectures composed of CoP nanoparticles and G is described. Benefiting from synergetic effects of a dual support system of CoP for electroactive sites and G to enhance charge transfer, low overpotentials of 120 mV for the HER (0.5 M H2SO4) and 292 mV for the OER (1 M KOH) are required to achieve current densities of 10 mAcm(-2). The as-prepared CoP/G composites, which serve as bifunctional catalysts for both HER and OER in complete water splitting, can generate a current density of 10 mAcm(-2) at 1.626 V. The present strategy provides a novel and efficient method for configuring high-efficiency electrocatalysts for energy-related storage and conversion devices.									75	2	0	0	4	0	75			2196-0216			WOS:000379985500008

Adequate light absorption, effective photogenerated carrier separation, and sufficiently large overpotentials for water redox are crucial in achieving high solar-to-hydrogen (STH) efficiency. These parameters thus strongly influence the design of novel photocatalytic materials. Two-dimensional (2D) PCs have flourished because of their large specific surface area ratio, short carrier migration distance compared to bulk PCs, enormous design flexibility via van der Waals heterostructure (HS) engineering and many other unique capabilities that meet the criteria for high-efficiency STH conversion. In this review, we summarize the recent developments of 2D materials and HSs for water-splitting applications from a theoretical perspective. Specifically, we first discuss a number of 2D materials and HSs employed for water-splitting. We review various strategies of material design to modulate and enhance the photocatalytic performance via improving light harvesting and carrier separation, such as the introduction of defects and dopants, and the application of strain, external electric field, rotation angles and ferroelectric switching. We then discuss the methods to evaluate hydrogen evolution reaction, oxygen evolution reaction and STH efficiency. Finally, the opportunities and challenges of designing 2D materials and HSs for water-splitting are presented.									15	0	0	0	0	0	15			0022-3727	1361-6463		WOS:000774575000001

Data reveal: (i) higher sensitivity of parameters of photosynthetic oxygen evolution (flash induced oxygen yields and oxygen burst under continuous illumination) in comparison to the widely used parameters of the chlorophyll fluorescence; (ii) higher sensitivity of oxygen evolution parameters of Chlorella cells to Q(B)-binding herbicides in comparison to the pea thylakoid membranes; (iii) similar sensitivity of the PAM parameters to herbicides for both Chlorella cells and thylakoid membranes from higher plants. The relationship between the herbicide sensitivity and the kinetic parameters of the oxygen evolution of green algae and higher plants are discussed. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Transition metal oxides (TMO) have been intensely investigated as one of the most efficient oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalysts. Unfortunately, their sluggish reaction kinetics towards hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) bring about poor overall performance. In this study, we perform a simple method to obtain the bifunctional TMO-based electrocatalyst by in-situ tailoring the components of cobalt nickel molybdenum oxide on nickel foam. By optimizing the annealing temperature and reaction atmosphere, we integrate HER-active (CoMoNi) and OER-active (CoMoOx) components together as bifunctional electrocatalysts for overall water splitting. Impressively, the as-synthesized electrocatalyst shows the high electrocatalytic activity for both OER and HER, and exhibit a low cell voltage of 1.59 V at 10 mA cm(-2) when applied as both the cathode and anode in alkaline solutions. Impressively, the bifunctional electrocatalysts work well at large current densities, even in the order of 1,000 mA cm(-2) (only need the cell voltage of similar to 2.03 V), and remain its activity more than 20 h. Such an outstanding performance should be mainly attributed to integrated high electronic conductivity, 3D self-supported structure, and good compatibility between HER-active and OER-active components. This study shows a positive model for the design of more promising and practical catalysts for full water splitting.									25	3	0	0	0	0	26			2196-0216			WOS:000456207200018

The oxygen evolution related issues, including gas separation, sluggish kinetics, over-potential and noble catalyst, also limit the application of this technology. Herein, using nickel hydroxide as a solid-state redox mediator, we combine the water reduction and the oxidization of liquid fuel (e.g. ethanol, methanol, formate, isopropanol or hypophosphite solution) to form a new electrolysis architecture for hydrogen production without above issues. The hydrogen production involves the cathodic water reduction and the anodic oxidization of Ni(OH)(2) -> NiOOH, and consequently the cathodic reduction of NiOOH -> Ni(OH)(2) is coupled with the anodic oxidization of liquid fuel to form a hybrid system for delivering stable electricity energy and recycling Ni(OH)(2).									12	2	1	0	0	0	14			2405-8297			WOS:000425894300028

Here, stars in this mass range are studied using a standard set of stellar physics. Two important aspects of the study are the direct coupling of a reaction network of roughly 220 nuclei to the structure calculation at all stages and the use of a subgrid model to describe the convective bounded flame that develops during neon and oxygen burning. Below 9.0 M-circle dot degenerate oxygen-neon cores form that may become either white dwarfs or electron-capture supernovae. Above 10.3 M-circle dot the evolution proceeds "normally" to iron-core collapse, without composition inversions or degenerate flashes. Emphasis here is upon the stars in between, which typically ignite oxygen burning off-center. After oxygen burns in a convectively bounded flame, silicon burning ignites in a degenerate flash that commences closer to the stellar center and with increasing violence for stars of larger mass. In some cases the silicon flash is so violent that it could lead to the early ejection of the hydrogen envelope. This might have interesting observable consequences. For example, the death of a 10.0 M-circle dot star could produce two supernova-like displays, a faint low-energy event due to the silicon flash, and an unusually bright supernova many months later as the low-energy ejecta from core collapse collides with the previously ejected envelope. The potential relation to the Crab supernova is discussed.									157	2	0	0	3	0	158			0004-637X	1538-4357		WOS:000361800900034

These applications have so far been limited because of the high price of the catalysts and the energy loss due to overpotentials. Hence, non-precious metal catalysts with high efficiency toward the OER/ORR are desirable. In this work, we employ density functional theory (DFT) calculations to study the OER/ORR on metalloporphyrin and halogenated metalloporphyrin frameworks. The free energies of the reaction intermediates, including OH, O and OOH, were measured on 14 metal sites (Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn, Ru, Rh, Pd, Ag, Ir, Pt and Au) of the metalloporphyrin frameworks. Adsorption free energy relations were found and used to establish the reaction trend. The group 9 metals, namely Co, Rh and Ir, turn out to be potential candidates for both the OER and ORR because they provide intermediate free energies close to those of an ideal catalyst. The substitution of halogen atoms at the beta-positions of the metalloporphyrins of group 9 metals modifies the adsorption free energies of the intermediates so that they become closer to the ideal values and in turn reduce the OER and ORR overpotentials. After functionalization, Co-Por-F provides the lowest ORR overpotential and reduces the OER overpotential, approaching the value for an expensive Ir catalyst. Analysis of the electronic structure shows that controlling the d-band splitting by chemical manipulation of the single active site catalyst can be the key to enhancing the efficiency of these reactions.									40	2	0	0	2	0	40			1463-9076	1463-9084		WOS:000414773100057	29082388

However, the mechanism by which elemental doping affects catalytic activity remains unclear. Herein, we doped NiFe LDH with the Mn element and investigated the effect of elemental doping on the electronic structure of NiFe LDH and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) performance.OperandoX-ray absorption spectroscopy analysis indicates that Mn doping promotes the formation of Ni(iv) ions. Density functional theory calculations reveal that Mn doping causes hybridization between Ni 3d and O 2p orbitals which facilitates the oxidation of Ni(ii) ions. Resultantly, more active Ni(iv) sites could be generated at a lower applied voltage, which is beneficial for the OER performance.									18	0	0	0	2	0	18			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000566092600011

Herein, abundant MnO/Co heterointerfaces are engineered in porous graphitic carbon (MnO/Co/PGC) polyhedrons via a facile hydrothermal-calcination route with a bimetal-organic framework as the precursor. The in situ generated Co nanocrystals not only create well-defined heterointerfaces with high conductivity to overcome the poor OER activity but also promote the formation of robust graphitic carbon. Owing to the desired composition and formation of the heterostructures, the resulting MnO/Co/PGC exhibits superior activity and stability toward both OER and ORR, which makes it an efficient air cathode for the rechargeable Zn-air battery. Importantly, the homemade Zn-air battery is able to deliver excellent performance including a peak power density of 172 mW cm(-2) and a specific capacity of 872 mAh g(-1), as well as excellent cycling stability (350 cycles), outperforming commercial mixed Pt/C||RuO2 catalysts.

Herein, we report the fabrication of Ag3PO4/MoS2 nanocomposites and, for the first time, their use in photocatalytic water splitting into oxygen under LED light illumination. Ag3PO4 nanoparticles were found to be anchored evenly on the surface of MoS2 nanosheets, confirming an efficient hybridization of two semiconductor materials. A maximum oxygen-generating rate of 201.6 mu mol . L-1 . g(-1) . h(-1) was determined when 200 mg MoS2 nanosheets were incorporated into Ag3PO4 nanoparticles, which is around 5 times higher than that of bulk Ag3PO4. Obvious enhancements in light-harvesting property, as well as electron-hole separation and charge transportation are revealed by the combination of different characterizations. ESR analysis verified that more active oxygen-containing radicals generate over illuminated Ag3PO4/MoS2 composite photocatalysts rather than irradiated Ag3PO4. The improvement in oxygen evolution performance of Ag3PO4/MoS2 composite photocatalysts is ascribed to wide spectra response in the visible-light region, more efficient charge separation, and enhanced oxidation capacity in the valence band (VB).

Advanced catalysts should have a high and bifunctional catalytic activity for ORR and OER. Moreover, the trade-off carbon in catalysts should have good oxidation resistance and high electronic conductivity and be used in a tiny amount. Up to now, it is still a challenge. Therefore, this work introduces a low-carbon CeOx/Ru@RuO2 nanosheet as efficient cathode catalysts for Li-O2 batteries and studies the preparation and working mechanisms using a variety of characterization and electrochemical techniques. The air oxidation treatment oxidizes Ru into Ru@RuO2 and simultaneously removes unstable C into CO2, leaving a tiny amount of stable carbon. CeOx/Ru@RuO2 has enormous mesopores, well-distributed sub-5 nm CeOx and Ru@RuO2 nanocrystals, a tiny amount of antioxidation carbon (1.2 %), and a high specific surface area of 159.3 m2 g-1. These aspects optimize the Li-O reaction and regulate the Li2O2 nucleation to form uniform and ultrathin Li2O2 nanoflakes. As a result, the ORR and OER overpotentials are only 0.17 V and 0.45 V, respectively.

Using liquid metal as a mediator, herein we report a novel painting-alloying-dealloying strategy to synthesize flexible, self-supported hexagonal beta-Co(OH)(2) nanosheet arrays anchored on Co plates. Free of any binder/conducting agent, the integrated Co(OH)(2)/Co electrode exhibits superior electrocatalytic activity (merely 332 mV @ 10mA cm(-2)) and stability (25 h with negligible degradation) towards OER in an alkaline solution, as benchmarked with the state-of-art Co-based catalysts. The enhanced performance of this electrode originates from the unique ultrathin (similar to 15 nm) nanosheet morphology (providing abundant active sites), the in-situ growth characteristic (improving the electronic conductivity) and the open array structure (accelerating the transfer of electrolyte and the release of gases). Thanks to the merit of liquid metal, both the pattern and shape of the integrated electrode can be facilely designed and regulated, without influencing the OER activity. Furthermore, using a separator between the anode and cathode, the integrated architecture of electrodes allows for the compact-type electrolyzer for overall water splitting. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

However, the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) involves a multi-electron-proton coupling transfer step that limits the efficiency of water splitting. Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop electrocatalysts with expected activity and stability to accelerate the kinetics of the oxygen evolution reaction. In this paper, hierarchically porous Cu(OH)(2)@(Fe, Co, Ni)MOF/CF nanosheet (denoted as Cu(OH)(2)@FCN MOF/CF) arrays were successfully prepared by the hydrothermally induced in situ growth of FCN MOF nanosheets using modified Cu(OH)(2) nanowires as carriers; herein, the tuned active species of metal ligands in the FCN MOF composition structure are used as the main catalytic reaction size in the OER. The synergistic effect of a unique porous structure and the active metal-ligand species in the MOF render the catalyst a large electrochemically active surface area and more active species. Then, the active material is fully contacted with the electrolyte to expose more electrochemically active sites, thus greatly improving the electrocatalytic activity and durability of the OER. Specifically, the Cu(OH)(2)@FCN MOF/CF delivers a minimum overpotential of 290 mV and low Tafel slope of 96.15 mV center dot dec(-1) at 10 mA center dot cm(-2) as well as ultra-long cycling stability. The resulted OER performance is superior to most reported MOF-based electrocatalysts. This novel structural design not only provides a new strategy for the facile preparation of low-cost and high-efficiency OER electrocatalysts but also paves an avenue for the development of other MOF-based composite electrocatalysts with excellent electrocatalytic performances.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1				2073-4344		WOS:000817440700001

Herein, we report a novel methodology that allows for a binder-free investigation of electrocatalyst nanoparticles. The potential-assisted immobilization of a non-noble metal catalyst, i.e., nickel-iron layered double hydroxide (NiFe LDH) nanoparticles, was employed to directly attach small nanoparticle ensembles from a suspension to the surface of etched carbon nanoelectrodes. The dimensions of this type of electrodes allowed for the immobilization of the catalyst material below the picogram scale and resulted in a high resolution towards the faradaic current response. In addition the effect of the electrochemical aging on the intrinsic activity of the catalyst was investigated in alkaline media by means of continuous cyclic voltammetry. A change in the material properties could be observed, which was accompanied by a substantial decrease in its intrinsic activity.									7	1	0	0	1	0	7			1998-0124	1998-0000		WOS:000449842500024

Meanwhile, it has a good endurance and stability with a negligible voltage changing after 15 h of testing. The work provides reference for the synthetic of catalyst with high catalytic kinetics and activity in the field of electrolytic water splitting.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			0022-4596	1095-726X		WOS:000615711800032

In this Minireview, we introduce some key considerations for anodic auxiliary electrosynthesis and outline three types of electrocatalytic organic reactions including biomass derivative, alcohol and amine oxidation reactions, which can boost cathodic hydrogen generation. Furthermore, frequently used noble-metal-free electrocatalysts are classified into nickel-based, cobalt-based, other transition-metal-based and bimetallic electrocatalysts. The preparation methods of these catalysts and their performance towards electrochemical oxidation reactions are also discussed in detail. We specifically highlight the importance of redox active sites on the surface of the electrocatalysts, which act as electron mediators to promote oxidation reactions. Finally, the current challenges and future developments in this emerging field are also discussed.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			2192-6506			WOS:000700187000012	34519445

It is calling for a ground-breaking catalyst with enough high selective CH4-converting lattice-oxygen carrying capacity but represents a grand challenge. Herein, we report an efficient catalyst obtainable by decorating an oxygen carrier FeMnO3 with Na2WO4, with good cycling performance, achieving a high space time yield of 29.8 g(C2-C3) kg(cat)(-1) h(-1) with 20% CH4 conversion and 80% C-2-C-3 selectivity at 800 degrees C and a low catalyst/CH4 weight ratio of 13.5. CL-OCM process is established by "FeMnO3. [MnFe2O4 + MnO]" redox cycle. Na2WO4-decoration gets lattice oxygen stored in FeMnO3 transformed from non-selective to selective due to mitigation of latticeoxygen evolution. Scaled up CL-OCM testing with 10-gram catalyst also yields comparable results seen in the case of using 1-gram catalyst, validating great application potential.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000820188600002

Herein, we report the synthesis of an effective cathode catalyst of ruthenium nanocrystals supported on carbon black substrate by a surfactant assisting method. The as-prepared ruthenium nanocrystals exhibited an excellent catalytic activity as cathodes in Li-O-2 batteries with a high reversible capacity of about 9,800 mAh g(-1), a low charge-discharge over-potential (about 0.37 V), and an outstanding cycle performance up to 150 cycles (with a curtaining capacity of 1,000 mAh g(-1)). The electrochemical testing shows that ruthenium nanocrystals can significantly reduce the charge potential comparing to carbon black catalysts, which demonstrated that ruthenium based nanomaterials could be effective cathode catalysts for high performance lithium- O-2 batteries.									153	9	0	0	9	0	157			2045-2322			WOS:000322062000006	23873349

Kinetics were studied by current-potential curves recorded under quasi-stationary conditions and reaction order determination. At low overpotentials, a Tafel slope of about 30 mV was found for materials having a 30-80%, mol RuO2 content. A reaction mechanism has been proposed accounting for the composition dependence of the Tafel slope and the order of reaction at constant potential. It has been concluded that mixed oxides bring about an increase in the real electrocalalytic activity, which can be attributed to the synergetic or edge effect between the oxide components. A mechanism for the anodic dissolution of Co3O4 is proposed. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.									142	7	0	0	4	3	142			0013-4686			WOS:000167167200013

Herein, we report nitrogen-doped carbon encapsulating gamma-MoC/Ni heterostructures (gamma-MoC/Ni@NC) for the first time as efficient OER electrocatalysts. The composites can be controlled by the addition of a Mo source to form a nanoparticle-assembled hierarchically porous nanostructure, which can enlarge the specific surface area, thus exposing more active sites. Moreover, we demonstrate that the formation gamma-MoC@Ni heterostructures and the resulting synergistic effect between gamma-MoC and Ni can facilitate the reaction kinetics, leading to significantly improved OER activity with an onset overpotential of merely 240 mV, and a low overpotential of 310 mV to afford a current density of 10 mA cm(-2).

This work reports the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) catalyzed by catalase, with a decreased activation energy manifested by a positive shift (+0.2 V) in onset potential. Direct bioelectrocatalysis with bovine liver catalase on a mercury-gold amalgam microelectrode is demonstrated. The background oxygen reduction reaction on the amalgam surface is inhibited by the protein, while the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) is facilitated. Catalase molecules whose prosthetic groups are not wired to the electrode retain their intrinsic activity towards disproportionation of H2O2 generated at the electrode. The Hg-Au amalgam electrode may also be used to detect dissolved catalase in the absence of its substrate (H2O2) in the solution.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1388-2481	1873-1902		WOS:000793252700002

Despite possessing promising characteristics to be applied in photocatalysis, the fast electron-hole pairs recombination is still one of the drawbacks involving this semiconductor. The use of conformal layers to minimize such limitation and to improve charge separation is the aim of this work. Herein, we report on the use of SnO2 as a conformal coating layer over the BiVO4 surface for O2 evolution reaction. The incorporation of SnO2 over the BiVO4 surface showed the beneficial effect in O2 evolution compared to the pristine material, resulting in 490 mmol after 6 h of irradiation. Transient absorption and surface photovoltage spectroscopies indicate enhanced charge carrier separation and transport by passivating BiVO4 with SnO2 thin layer. Even though the O2 evolution tests in this work were carried out without the presence of a co-catalyst, the use of a thin conformal coating of SnO2 over BiVO4 showed promising results for further studies.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			0360-3199	1879-3487		WOS:000746612900002

Here, a facile one-step solvothermal strategy was applied to fabricate amorphous iron-cobalt-molybdenum oxide flakes containing MoSx and sulphate (FCMOS), which reveals a low overpotential of 260 mV to achieve the current density of 10 mA cm(-2), together with a lower Tafel slope (47 mV dec(-1)), large electrochemical active surface area (ECSA) as well as wonderful durability. The excellent OER performance could be attributed to the acceleration of the reaction *OH -> *O + *H by MoSx, optimization of the deprotonation of *OOH by sulfate, and the synergistic polymetallic effect.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000637412100001

However, the reaction mostly depends on noble metal catalysts for the generation of reactive oxygen species to accelerate the oxidation of alcohol groups. Here, we report a facile route to generate a highly active catalyst for the simultaneous production of FDCA via HMF oxidation and high-purity H-2. Co3O4 nanowires with a pine needle-like shape were in situ grown on nickel foam (CoNW/NF) and employed as bifunctional catalysts for both the electrooxidation of HMF and the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), realizing a high catalytic activity, robust electrochemical durability and nearly 100% faradaic efficiency. Such an inexpensive and monolithic electrode may assist in upgrading biochemicals with a high energy efficiency.									38	3	0	0	1	0	39			1463-9262	1463-9270		WOS:000510866800018

Through the ECT process with lithiation and subsequent rapid delithiation in water, the NiSi nanowires developed amorphous shells dispersed with nanoparticles around intact cores, which preserved their electrical conductivity. Moreover, the amorphous shells of the NiSi nanowires exhibited structural and chemical reconstructions, which further regulated the surface states to become favorable for the O-2 evolution reaction (OER) and H-2 evolution reaction (HER) by enabling the lattice oxide mechanism and hydrogen adsorption energy, respectively. Because of these SAEs, the NiSi nanowires exhibited excellent electrochemical activities for both the OER and HER with overpotentials of 296 and 156 mV, respectively, at a current density of 100 mA/cm(2).

In relative to the single metal oxide-based oxygen carrier (OC), combined OC owned superiority for CLC of coal. In this research, combined NiFe2O4 OC was synthesized using sol-gel combustion synthesis method, and its reaction with a typical Chinese high-sulfur coal as Liuzhi (LZ) coal was performed in a thermogravimetric analyzer (TG). And then, systematic investigation was carried out to explore the evolution of sulfur species and minerals involved in coal and their interaction with the reduced NiFe2O4 OC through different means, including fourier transform infrared (FTIR), field scanning electron microscopy/energy-dispersive X-ray spectrometry, X-ray diffraction, and thermodynamic simulation. TG-FTIR analysis of LZ reaction with NiFe2O4 indicated that two reaction stages were experienced at 350-550 and 800-900 A degrees C, respectively, far different from LZ pyrolysis, and SO2 occurred mainly related to oxidization of H2S with NiFe2O4 over 550 A degrees C. Meanwhile, lattice oxygen transfer rates of NiFe2O4 involved at the two reaction stages were higher than that of directly mixed NiO with Fe2O3 OC and thus more beneficial for LZ coal conversion. Both experimental means and thermodynamic simulation of the solid-reduced residues of NiFe2O4 with LZ coal indicated that the main-reduced counterparts of NiFe2O4 were Ni and Fe3O4. In addition, though good regeneration of the reduced NiFe2O4 was reached, the side products Ni3S2 and Ni2SiO4 should be noted as well for its detrimental effect on the reactivity of NiFe2O4 OC.									45	6	0	0	1	0	50			1388-6150	1588-2926		WOS:000344810300023

Herein, we report the phase and composition controlled synthesis of cobalt sulfide (CoSx) hollow nanospheres (HNSs) and their catalytic efficiencies for hydrogen and oxygen evolution reactions in alkaline media. Three CoSx compounds, i.e., Co9S8, Co3S4, and CoS2 HNSs, were precisely synthesized by simply adjusting the molar ratio of carbon disulfide to cobalt acetate using a facile solution-based strategy. Electrochemical results reveal that the as-prepared CoS2 HNSs exhibit superior OER and HER catalytic performance to Co9S8 and Co3S4 HNSs in 1.0 M KOH, with overpotentials of 290 mV for the OER and 193 mV for the HER at 10 mA cm(-2), and the corresponding Tafel slopes of 57 and 100 mV dec(-1), respectively. In addition, the CoS2 HNSs exhibit remarkable long-term catalytic durability, which is even superior to precious metal catalysts of RuO2 and Pt/C. Moreover, an alkaline electrolyzer assembled using CoS2 HNSs as both anode and cathode materials can achieve 10 mA cm(-2) at a low cell voltage of 1.54 V at 60 degrees C with a faradaic efficiency of 100% for overall water splitting. Further analysis demonstrates that the surface morphology, crystallographic structure and coordination environment of Con+ active sites in combination determine the HER/OER activities in the synthesized binary CoSx series, which would provide insight into the rational design of transition metal chalcogenides for highly efficient hydrogen and oxygen-involved electrocatalysis.									176	15	0	0	8	0	178			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000428786800023	29473086

Herein, we demonstrate hollow structured FeNi3N nanoparticles with largely improved intrinsic activity synthesized via combining facile oxygen-etching with thermal nitridation as efficient bifunctional catalysts for overall water splitting. Facile structure and morphology tuning is realized without involving a conductive support or complicated fabrication procedures, and this catalyst shows many good catalytic characteristics including high catalytic activity, excellent stability, and accelerated catalytic kinetics. To our delight, this facile approach endows FeNi3N nanoparticles with largely improved activity for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and meanwhile without performance loss for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). In specific, overpotentials required for 10 mA cm(-2) are only 185 and 210 mV for the HER and OER, respectively, much lower than those of bulk FeNi3N (235 and 280 mV @ 10 mA cm(-2) for the HER and OER), accompanying appreciated long-term stability. A low cell voltage of 1.63 V is realized in water electrolysis to offer a current density of 10 mA cm(-2), about 130 mV lower compared to that of a bulk state FeNi3N catalyst. The structural evolution of metal (oxy)hydroxide is observed from the in situ Raman spectrum, and the significance of metal (oxy)hydroxides is revealed for both the electrodes of the HER and OER. The promotion effect compared with pristine FeNi3 and bulk FeNi3N is studied with the help of thorough physical characterization and electrochemical measurements. The largely improved performance is affirmatively attributed to the metallic characteristic FeNi3N phases, high active site exposure, and boosted intrinsic activity. The current findings are helpful for designing subsequent transition metal-based catalysts applied for the water electrolysis technique.									23	1	0	0	3	0	23			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000635284900038

Herein, catalysts with the Ni3Fe alloy embedded in Ni3FeN ultrathin nanosheets (similar to 1 nm) were fabricated through thermal ammonolysis treatment of cation-vacant monolayered NiFe layered double hydroxides. The emergence of the Ni3Fe alloy during the annealing process unavoidably leads to strain output to adjacent microstructures in ultrathin nanosheets, contributing to the formation of lattice dislocations. Such lattice defects, combining the ultrathin 2D morphology and synergistic interfacial effect between Ni3FeN and Ni3Fe, endow the electrocatalyst (d-Ni3FeN/Ni3Fe) with excellent electrocatalytic performance for both the OER and HER in alkaline media, requiring overpotentials of 250 mV and 125 mV to drive a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) in 1 M KOH, respectively. The water electrolyzer with d-Ni3FeN/Ni3Fe as the cathode and anode yields a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at a low cell voltage of 1.61 V, and exhibits excellent durability of over 90 h, outperforming the commercial IrO2||Pt/C cell. The present study offers a new trial of lattice defect engineering to develop high-performance non-precious bifunctional electrocatalysts for overall water splitting.									20	0	0	0	0	0	20			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000621407000021

Zn constructs micro/nano porous structure to boost efficient oxygen evolution reaction for bulk NiFe alloy								JOURNAL OF ALLOYS AND COMPOUNDS				903						164004	10.1016/j.jallcom.2022.164004				MAY 15 2022	2022	Oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrocatalysts play an important role in producing high purity hydrogen fuels in the water splitting reaction. However, developing bulk catalytic electrode with low-cost and efficient activity for OER is still a challenge. In this paper, the porous bulk NiFe alloys with nanosheet structure were fabricated by a facile microwave sintering powder metallurgy method coupled with Zn as space holder. The obtained porous bulk Ni0.75Fe0.25 alloy exhibits the high catalytic activity for OER with a low overpotential of 235 mV at 100 mA cm(-2), a small Tafel slope of 26.1 mV dec(-1) and superior stability in 1.0 M KOH. In addition, the residual Zn in the porous NiFe alloy can be dissolved to further improve the specific surface area, and a metal (oxy)hydroxide amorphous layer is formed through electrochemical self-reconstruction during the OER process. This Zn-doped porous bulk NiFe catalyst with high OER catalytic performance and outstanding stability can become a promising candidate for commercial water splitting. (C) 2022 Elsevier B.V.

In nature, [NiFe] hydrogenases show excellent O-2-tolerance and can rapidly reactivate the active site. This work aims to understand the reduction of O-2 on the active site of [NiFe] hydrogenases. From the density functional theory (DFT) calculations, the free energy diagram for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) has been derived and the rate-determining step is found to be the Ni-B to Ni-SIb' step. Our calculation explains the slow reactivation for the Ni-A state compared to the Ni-B state, which is due to the particularly stable structure of the Ni-A state.									5	0	0	0	1	0	5			1463-9076	1463-9084		WOS:000447370600037	30183033

In this regard, we propose a novel strategy involving the in situ conversion of flake nickel-cobalt hydroxide into NiCo MOF with a unique biomimetic architecture (i. e. Venus flytrap-like morphology with dense 1D nanowires anchoring on 2D nanosheets), and further phosphating the precursor into NiCoP that possesses a similar, distinctive structure. Specifically, 1D nanowires afford effective electron transfer, while 2D nanosheets provide enhanced mechanical stability to the composite. The experimental results show that this material has an enormous amount of available active sites, accelerated charge/mass transfer, and a structural synergistic effect. As a result, the as-prepared NiCoP/nickel foam (NF) catalyst only requires overpotentials of 78 and 262 mV to reach a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) for the HER and OER in 1.0 M KOH, respectively. Furthermore, the application of NiCoP/NF as a bifunctional catalyst for the overall water splitting reaction yields current densities of 10 mA cm(-2) at 1.60 V. Therefore, this is an effective strategy for the development of next-generation electrocatalysts for solar-energy conversion.									7	0	0	0	0	0	7			2196-0216			WOS:000664757700001

Alpha-MnO2 and LaNiO3 severed as the catalysts for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The anodic and cathodic polarization and individual cell voltages were measured at constant charge-discharge (C-D) current densities indicating a uniform voltage profile for each single cell. One hundred C-D cycles were carried out for the stack. The results showed that, over the initial 10 cycles, the average C-D voltage gap was about 0.94 V and the average energy efficiency reached 89.28% with current density charging at 15 mA.cm(-2) and discharging at 25 mA.cm(-2). The total increase in charging voltage over the 100 C-D cycles was similar to 1.56% demonstrating excellent stability performance. The stack performance degradation was analyzed by galvanostatic electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. The charge transfer resistance of ORR increased from 1.57 to 2.21 Omega and that of Zn/Zn2+ reaction increased from 0.21 to 0.34 Omega after 100 C-D cycles. The quantitative analysis guided the potential for the optimization of both positive and negative electrodes to improve the cycle life of the cell stack.									34	3	0	0	1	0	37			1996-1073			WOS:000344467200018

The micrometer-sized MoS2 sheets were obtained through ultrasonication exfoliation of the bulk MoS2, only showing little oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activity. MoS2/NG hybrid was obtained by loading MoS2 sheets onto NG through ultrasonication, and the resulting nanocomposites exhibited improved electrocatalytic activity for ORR with dominant 4 electron pathway in alkaline solutions. The exposed active edges as well as the synergistic effect and reduced resistance connection jointly make the MoS2/NG composite a highly competitive ORR catalyst. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

In this study, a unique method is used for increasing the N-A by converting the smooth ultrathin atomic-layer-deposited nanoshells of the electrocatalysts into nano-roughened active shell layers using a controlled anion-exchange reaction (AER). The coarse thin nanoshells present abundant surface active sites, which are generated owing to the inherent unit-cell volume mismatch induced during the AER. Consequently, the nano-roughened electrodes accelerate the sluggish water reaction kinetics and lower the overpotentials required for the hydrogen and oxygen evolution reactions. In addition, the electronic modulation induced by the nanoshell layer at the core-nanoshell interface amplifies the local electron density, as confirmed using electrochemical analysis data and density functional theory calculations. Because of the integrity of the composite electrodes during water-splitting half-cell reactions, their durability for industrial seawater electrolysis is evaluated. The results indicate that their electrochemical activity does not change significantly after 10 days of continuous overall water splitting.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			2366-9608			WOS:000738873800001	34970869

A substantial challenge is to extend low-cost electrocatalysts consisting of earth-abundant resources, prepared by straightforward approaches that display high intrinsic activity compared to noble metals. The expansion of bifunctional catalysts in alkaline electrolytes for both the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) has become very crucial in recent times. Herein, the recent progress in cobalt-based HER-OER electrocatalysts has been are brushed up and numerous bifunctional cobalt-based catalysts such as cobalt-oxides, phosphides, sulfides, selenides, nitrides, borides, carbides, perovskites, and MOF-based cobalt analogs have been investigated in detail. Specifically, much more attention has been paid to their structural variation, bifunctional activity, overpotential of the overall system, and stability. Cobalt-based catalysts with lower cell voltage, remarkable durability, and unique electronic structures, offer a new perspective in energy-related fields. In recent years, cobalt-based analogs with diagnostic facilities have been introduced due to their electronic structures, tunable d band structures, and tailorable active sites. This perspective also elucidates the present issues, promising ideas, and future forecasts for cobalt-based catalysts. The critical aspects of cobalt-based catalysts and the numerous opportunities, as discussed at the end, can possibly enrich the sustainable energy field.									9	0	0	0	0	0	9			1477-9226	1477-9234		WOS:000563083800001	32662489

However, preparing a catalyst layer that consists of nanoparticles, involves several costly steps and requires a well-controlled and safe production line. Herein, we report the fabrication of a free-standing support-free textile catalyst comprised of randomly oriented rutile IrO2 crystalline clusters with diameters in the range 1-3 nm, which are connected through dense crystalline domain boundaries. This textile catalyst can be prepared by combining two industrially established techniques, sputtering and electrospinning, which neither require an environmentally controlled costly synthesis, cleaning, and customized collecting processes for nanomaterials, nor highly engineered transferring processes to prepare the catalyst layer. By tuning the curvature of templated water-soluble polymer nanofibers, the highest mass activity and turnover frequency of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) were achieved for non-doped or pure IrO2. The high OER activity was attributed to the presence of thermodynamically unstable surfaces, which hold large numbers of undercoordinated Ir atoms.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000599249300014

FeNi NPs (NPs) in situ generated were found to be in intimate contact in the nano-mixture which upon formation performs as catalysts for photocatalytic hydrogen evolution in the same system under air atmosphere. Under bright LED light irradiation, the system with FeNi produced more than three times hydrogen than systems with same molar amount of single Fe or Ni component. Importantly, about two-fold higher hydrogen production activity compared with noble metal Pt catalyst under air atmosphere was observed. The work exhibited an economic and effective means of harnessing cheap bimetallics for tackling photocatalytic hydrogen evolution reactions. The mechanistic insights governing the photocatalytic processes and the factors leading to the enhanced hydrogen evolution activity were discussed. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Herein, graphene nanocomposites with Ru-RuO2 Mott-Schottky heterojunctions (Ru-RuO2@NPC) are prepared pyrolytically and exhibit a remarkable electrocatalytic activity at pH = 0-14 towards both oxygen/hydrogen evolution reactions and overall water splitting, as compared to commercial RuO2 and Pt/C. Ru-RuO2@NPC can also be used as an effective air cathode catalyst for flexible, rechargeable zinc-air batteries. Density functional theory calculations show that the formation of Ru-RuO2 heterojunctions moderately enhances the surface charge density of metallic Ru and brings the d states closer to Fermi level, as compared to that of RuO2 alone, leading to improved intrinsic electrocatalytic activity towards these important reactions. These results demonstrate the significance of Mott-Schottky heterojunctions in the development of high-efficiency electrocatalysts for various new energy technologies.									39	0	0	0	0	0	39			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000720469000006

Trimetallic NiFeMo alloy is synthesized by hydrothermal deposition from inorganic precursors and subsequent low-temperature thermal annealing. A complete cell made of NiFeMo electrodes on nickel foam exhibits a low voltage of 1.45 V at 10 mA/cm(2) as a result of low overpotentials for both hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER). High-resolution transmission electron microscopy reveals that nanometer-sized single-crystal domains of Ni, Fe, and Mo are intimately integrated at the atomic level, which enables a synergistic effect of metallic Ni, Fe, and Mo for efficient HER, while self formed Ni-Fe-Mo (oxy)hydroxides on the surface of the NiFeMo anode become active sites for OER. Such a multimetallic alloy and its (oxy)hydroxides represent a typical HER/OER catalyst couple, and our method provides a new route to develop efficient low-cost metallic alloys for overall water splitting.									135	4	0	0	8	0	137			2380-8195			WOS:000427444300009

The generation-collection mode of scanning electrochemical microscopy (SECM) using nanostructured Pt microdisc probes was exploited to detect soluble reaction products formed at the voltammetric peaks of the alpha-Fe2O3 electrode. SECM tip-substrate voltammetry unexpectedly showed that the reduction of Fe-VI to Fe-III on the cathodic sweep is accompanied by significant O-2 evolution. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Understanding the effects of composition and morphology of iron-nickel nanoparticles is crucial for optimization and enhanced electrocatalyst performance. Both physical surface area and electrochemical surface area (ECSA) are functions of morphology. In this study, three different iron-nickel nanoparticle catalysts were synthesized. The three catalysts were varied based on morphology (alloy versus core-shell) and composition (high versus low stabilizer concentration). Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface area analysis was conducted on the synthesized iron-nickel nanoparticles using a physisorption analyzer while electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was employed to quantify the ECSA by capacitance. Comparison of ECSA and BET results to electrocatalyst overpotential suggests both available surface area and nanoparticle morphology play roles in electrocatalytic activity.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			1938-5862			INSPEC:18500741

Advancing their principles and elucidating the inherent microscopic mechanisms can have a huge impact on the understanding of the fundamental laws of the universe, as well as the knowledge to improve performances of energy conversion/storage devices. Therefore, it has become one of the most important subjects. Based on the recent advancements in the field of quantum electrochemistry, an electrocatalyst enabling the quantum electrode processes, namely, a quantum electrocatalyst, is the focus of this Perspective Review. In particular, quantum-tunneling-driven multielectron/multiproton transfers, in which several electrons and protons are spontaneously and/or sequentially transferred at the electrode/electrolyte interfaces, are mainly discussed. These reactions emerge from the nontrivial interactions between the electrodes, reactants, and solvents; therefore, they are essentially fairly complicated phenomena. Together with the confirmation of the basic experimental tips to reliably measure the electrochemical properties and discussions on how to practically use the electrochemical kinetic isotope effect to analyze complicated energy conversion reactions, this contribution has formulated conjectures with regard to microscopic mechanisms involving key electrode processes, i.e., oxygen reduction reaction and hydrogen evolution reaction, as well as the potential of quantum electrocatalysts toward the further advancement of energy conversion technologies.									9	0	0	0	0	0	9			1463-9076	1463-9084		WOS:000538039300004	32426781

While tendencies towards dissolution can be grasped considering available thermodynamic data, the kinetics of material's stability in real conditions is still difficult to predict and have to be measured experimentally, ideally in-situ and/or on-line. On-line inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) is a technique developed recently to address exactly this issue. It allows time- and potential-resolved analysis of dissolution products in the electrolyte during the reaction under dynamic conditions. In this work, applications of on-line ICP-MS techniques in studies embracing dissolution of catalysts for oxygen reduction (ORR) and evolution (OER) as well as hydrogen oxidation (HOR) and evolution (HER) reactions are reviewed.									54	1	0	0	4	0	55			1527-8999	1528-0691		WOS:000492045400005	30589199

Although some oxide semiconductors have already been demonstrated as efficient and stable photocatalysts for overall water splitting under UV light irradiation, no oxide semiconductor photocatalysts have been reported so far to split water efficiently under visible light irradiation. Hence, screening of visible-light-absorbing oxide semiconductors is highly demanded for photocatalytic water splitting. Herein, Sr2CoTaO6 double perovskite oxide has been identified as a visible-light-absorbing semiconductor photocatalyst with an electronic band structure suitable for overall water splitting by density of states (DOS) analysis. To demonstrate the capability of photocatalytic water splitting properties of Sr2CoTaO6, cubic-shaped Sr2CoTaO6-F and irregular-shaped Sr2CoTaO6-S were synthesized by the facile flux method (F) and the conventional high-temperature solid-state reaction method (S). The experimental analysis of the band structure indicates that the synthesized Sr2CoTaO6 is an n-type semiconductor with a bandgap of 2.7 eV, and the minimum of conduction band (CB) positions and the maximum of valence band (VB) positions are located at -0.87 and +1.83 V vs normal hydrogen electrode (NHE, pH = 7), respectively. Sr2CoTaO6-F showed much higher photocatalytic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) activities than Sr2CoTaO6-S, indicating the advantage of the flux method in synthesizing double perovskite oxides in control of crystallinity and morphology. Without loading any cocatalysts, Sr2CoTaO6-F showed bifunctional photocatalytic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) activities in the presence of sacrificial reagents under visible light irradiation, which is rarely reported for metal-oxide-based photocatalysts. The photocatalytic OER and HER activities could be further enhanced by loading RuO2 and Rh cocatalysts, respectively. This work further supports that visible-light-absorbing double perovskite oxide semiconductors are promising candidates worth exploring for photocatalytic water splitting.									21	1	0	0	2	0	20			2168-0485			WOS:000575352800033		
J	Huang, Jianhang; Wang, Yonggang					Huang, Jianhang/0000-0002-1471-0770			Efficient Renewable-to-Hydrogen Conversion via Decoupled Electrochemical Water Splitting								CELL REPORTS PHYSICAL SCIENCE				1	8					100138	10.1016/j.xcrp.2020.100138				AUG 26 2020	2020	Water electrolysis powered by renewables provides a green approach to hydrogen production to support the "hydrogen economy." However, the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) are tightly coupled in both time and space in traditional water electrolysis, which brings inherent operational challenges, such as the mixture of H-2/O-2 and the limited HER rate caused by the sluggish kinetics of OER. Against this background, decoupling H-2 and O-2 production in water electrolysis by using the auxiliary redox mediator was first proposed in 2013, in which O-2 and H-2 are produced at different times, rates, and/or locations. The decoupling strategy offers not only a new way to facilitate renewables to H-2, but it can also be applied in other chemical or electrochemical processes. This review describes recent efforts to develop high-performance redox mediators, optimized strategies in decoupled water electrolysis, the design of electrolyzer configuration, the challenges faced, and the prospective directions.									23	0	0	0	4	1	24				2666-3864		WOS:000658750600005

Herein, the self-boosting catalysis of LiCoO2 as an electrocatalyst for Li-O-2 batteries and the investigation of its self-adjustment mechanism using in situ X-ray absorption spectroscopy and other operando characterization techniques is reported. The intercalation/extraction of Li+ in LiCoO2 not only induces the change in Co valence and modulates the electronic/crystal structure but also tunes the surface disorder degree, lattice strain, and local symmetry, which all affect the catalysis activity. In a discharge, highly ordered LiCoO2 acts as a catalyst to boost oxygen reduction reaction. During charging, the initial extraction of Li+ from LiCoO2 induces Li/oxygen vacancy and Co4+, which deforms CoO6 octahedron as well as lowers the symmetry, and accordingly promotes oxygen evolution reaction. This article offers insights into tuning the activity of catalysts for Li-O-2 batteries with the intercalation/extraction of alkali metal ions in traditional cathodes.									16	3	0	0	0	0	17			1616-301X	1616-3028		WOS:000535018400001

Herein, a facile two-step cathodic deposition followed by anodic activation protocol has been demonstrated, using a simple DC power supply, for the preparation of NiOOH\Fe2O3 composite made of amorphous NiOOH and crystalline Fe2O3 confirmed by powder X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray photoelectron (XPS), Raman spectroscopy and cyclic voltammogram (CV) results. The anodic activation increases the concentration of Ni3+ on the surface and thereby enhances the OER performance. The thin film of crystalline Fe2O3 enhances the OER performance, while thick film of crystalline Fe2O3 significantly decreases the OER performance of amorphous NiOOH. The NiOOH\Fe2O3 composite displays the low overpotential of 325 mV@10 mA cm(-2) (1.55 V vs. RHE) with excellent long-term stability over 50 h.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0366-6352	2585-7290		WOS:000838474800001

XRD results indicate that two of the five diffraction peak results at 9.2 degrees and 18.2 degrees may be attributed to low crystallinity of MoS2. The (002) diffraction peaks for the Co-doped MoS2 shifted to smaller angle, which may be due to the Mo4+ ions (r = 0.65 angstrom) having been replaced by larger Co2+ ions (r = 0.74 angstrom). Raman results show that the intensity of the A(1g) mode was greater than that of the E-2g(1) mode for our samples; this indicates that the samples have edge-terminated structures and possess more electrocatalytic active sites. The results of XPS also confirm that the cobalt ions substituted molybdenum atoms into the lattice of MoS2. Results from the electrocatalytic test confirms that cobalt doping reduces the charge transfer resistance and increases the electrocatalytic active sites, which are conducive to improving its electrocatalytic performance.									23	1	0	0	0	0	23			1452-3981			WOS:000489224100036

Improving Pt utilization via alloying or by forming corepshell structures is important for enhancing Pt activity and overall electrocatalytic performance. Herein, we report a simple seed-mediated method for synthesizing a dodecahedral PtCu alloy atomic shell on Pd nanocrystals. Significantly, such a Pd@PtCu nanocomposite with unique core@alloy-shell structure achieves a 25-fold and 6-fold enhancement of mass activity for HER and ORR, respectively, compared with the commercial Pt/C catalyst in acid media. Moreover, the unique Pd@PtCu catalyst shows only 1.0 mV increase in overpotential at 10 mA cm(-2) after 10 000 cycles for HER and almost no activity decay after 5 000 cycles for ORR, indicating the high endurance of Pd@PtCu in the electrochemical environment.									102	10	0	0	5	0	103			2380-8195			WOS:000430369600025

In this study, we have successfully synthesized single crystalline iridium dioxide (IrO2) nanosheets with thickness of less than 0.7 nm via exfoliation of layered iridic acid HxIryOz center dot nH(2)O, which was prepared via proton exchange of layered potassium iridate, KxIryOz center dot nH(2)O. The electrochemically active surface area of the IrO2 nanosheet electrode was similar to or slightly lower than that of 3-nm IrO2 nanoparticles. Despite the lower active surface area, the mass activity for oxygen evolution reaction of IrO2 nanosheets was six times higher compared to that of IrO2 nanoparticles in 0.1 MHClO4 at 1.55 V vs. the reversible hydrogen electrode (17.4 vs. 2.9 A g(-1)). When IrO2 nanosheets were added to commercial Pt/C as a co-catalyst, increased stability against high potential cycling was obtained. After potential cycling between 1.0 and 1.5 V, the composite catalyst exhibited two times higher oxygen reduction activity compared to nonmodified Pt/C. This durability enhancement is attributed to the suppression of the particle growth during the potential cycling test by the modification with IrO2 nanosheets.									25	3	0	0	1	0	25			1868-2529	1868-5994		WOS:000399162500007

In particular, Fe-doped NiOOH has shown record-high OER performance in alkaline media among various catalysts. Theoretically, undercoordinated facets including Ni4+, exposed at the edges of NiOOH, were predicted to perform highly active OER. Therefore, here we suggest a rational catalyst design, a vertical-crystalline beta-Fe/NiOOH layer built on faceted Fe/Ni nanocrystals, which exposes Ni4+ sites and could improve the OER performance dramatically. Electrochemical OER tests recorded the overpotential of 210 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) GEO and stable operation for 5 days. In situ/operando and density functional theory studies revealed that the Ni valence cycle between +2 and +4 assisted by Fe dopant is the key engine that greatly accelerates OER kinetics and that the vertical-crystalline beta-Fe/NiOOH layers on Ni octahedra are stable under harsh OER conditions.									8	0	0	0	0	0	8			2590-2393	2590-2385		WOS:000717520800003

The prepared Ni3S2/TiO2 NTA photoanode shows better photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting activity compared to pure TiO2 NTAs. The surface photovoltage (SPV) spectroscopy and transient photocurrent measurements provide direct evidence for the efficient charge separation of the Ni3S2/TiO2 NTA photoanode. Furthermore, the work function measurement proved the formation of the interfacial electric field at the interface of Ni3S2 and TiO2, which is the main driving force of charge separation. Photoelectrochemical impedance spectroscopy (PEIS) measurements and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) polarization curves confirmed that the Ni3S2/TiO2 NTA photoanode effectively reduces the interfacial charge transfer resistance and suppresses the overpotential of water oxidation, which make the photogenerated holes take part in the water oxidation reaction easily. These results demonstrate that Ni3S2 could be an excellent cocatalyst when applied in PEC water oxidation.									15	0	0	0	1	0	15			2046-2069			WOS:000387427800063

Herein, the synthesis of dual-cation (Fe, Co)-incorporated NiSe2 nanosheets (Fe, Co-NiSe2) and systematical investigation of their electrocatalytic performance for water splitting as a function of the composition are reported. The dual-cation incorporation can distort the lattice and induce stronger electronic interaction, leading to increased active site exposure and optimized adsorption energy of reaction intermediates compared to single-cation-doped or pure NiSe2. As a result, the obtained Fe0.09Co0.13-NiSe2 porous nanosheet electrode shows an optimized catalytic activity with a low overpotential of 251 mV for oxygen evolution reaction and 92 mV for hydrogen evolution reaction (both at 10 mA cm(-2) in 1 m KOH). When used as bifunctional electrodes for overall water splitting, the current density of 10 mA cm(-2) is achieved at a low cell voltage of 1.52 V.

Investigating the objective rules of structural characteristics and pyrolysis reactions of oil sands bitumen can enhance the knowledge of the pyrolysis reaction mechanism. This paper carried out the extensive experimental characterization of the chemical structure of Karamay oil sands bitumen (KBS) in Xinjiang, China. Then, the thermal evolution mechanism of the chemical structure of KBS was investigated by focusing on the thermogravimetric analysis and combining the characterization results of KBS at different pyrolysis final temperatures. The results show that the pyrolysis of KBS belonged to a parallel reaction. On one hand, aliphatic groups, as the main structure, undergo thermal cracking reactions to produce light oil. The oxygen-containing functional groups contributed to the production of CO and CO2. On the other hand, the aromatic structure, which has a high degree of condensation and high tightness, would condense into a more challenging to decompose coke during pyrolysis.

The oxygen catalysts play an increasingly greater role in expanding the energy conversion efficiencies of rechargeable Zn-air batteries. Metal organic frameworks (MOFs) have greatly noticed as versatile precursors to design and establish highly efficient bifunctional catalysts owing to their adjustable component, flexible tailing capability and high surface area. Herein, a highly active OER/ORR catalyst was synthesized by a facile metal induction pyrolysis strategy using bimetallic NiCo-ZIF-67 as precursor, obtaining a special characteristics with high pyridinic N doping level (similar to 42.6%) and ultrafine metal nanocrystals embedded in carbon nanotubes. The as-prepared Ni1Co3@N-CNTs demonstrates a moderate OER activity with a low overpotential of only similar to 290 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) and a low Tafel slop of 56 mV dec(-1). Meanwhile, it reaches a much higher half-wave potential of 0.85 V for ORR, which could rival the most of reported materials. Importantly, when being applied as oxygen catalyst in rechargeable Zn-air batteries, decent electrochemical performance of open-circuit potential and high power density were achieved, even superior than those of the commercial Pt/C and RuO2 electrode.									21	1	0	0	0	0	21			0378-7753	1873-2755		WOS:000558890300018

Herein, amorphous Fe-Ni bimetallic hydroxides film on the conductive FeS nanosheets supported by three-dimensional iron foam (IF) (denoted as FeNi(OH)(x)/FeS/IF) has been successfully synthesized by an ultrafast surface modification process (30 s). The fast surface reaction using FeS/IF as substrate in nickel nitrate solution facilitates the formation of bimetallic ultrathin film of FeNi(OH)(x) with enhanced performance oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Owing to the excellent conductivity, FeS nanosheets supported by IF may improve the dispersion and conductivity of FeNi(OH)(x) as active sites for OER. The physical characterizations confirm the closed interaction of FeNi(OH)(x)/FeS/IF, which suggests the validity of this facile surface modification. The electrochemical measurements show that FeNi(OH)(x)/FeS/IF only need a low overpotential of 273 mV to reach the 100 mA cm(-2) (geometric current density) towards OER. The excellent catalytic performance can be attributed to the improved conductivity of substrate, a greater number of active sites and strong the synergistic effect of the Fe-Ni bimetallic hydroxides. The great long-term stability has been obtained. This work provides a simple route to produce advanced hierarchical nanostructure as electrocatalysts for OER. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

In this study, a high performance catalyst based on a bimetallic Pt-Cu alloy is investigated for Li-O-2 batteries using first-principles calculation. The theoretical prediction shows that the Pt-Cu alloy is much more effectiye than the pure Pt according to the electrochemical performance. In particular, the effectiveness of the catalytic property is maximized in the case of the PtCu (111) surface which greatly reduces the large over-potentials of the original Li-O-2 batteries during the OER/ORR. It is identified for the first time that the charge overpotentials are affected mainly by the inherent surface charge character of the alloy catalyst. It is observed that the more negatively charged PtCu (111) surface can act as a weakly positively charged surface for the adsorption of Li-O intermediates and thus result in weak ionic bonding of the intermediates on the surface. As a result, the dominant factor improving the catalytic performance is clearly demonstrated, providing insight into the design of an efficient catalyst for Li-O-2 battery technologies.

Among of them, chemical looping gasification (CLG) of biogas residues likely achieves the high-quality syngas production using the oxygen carriers (OCs). Since the nature of the solid-solid contact in CLG reactions resulting in greatly worsening reaction rates and syngas product quality, the development an oxygen-uncoupling type OCs is highly demanding. This study introduces the preparation, characterizations and performance evaluation on Bi-functional Mn/Ca2Fe2O5 oxygen carriers (OCs) achieving the oxygen-uncoupling and catalytic CO2 conversion to CO. The Mn-doping Ca2Fe2O5-based OCs with Mn in 20 mol.% (20MnCaFe) achieves an optimal gasification efficiency, carbon conversion efficiency in 72.31% and 95.72% respectively with lower CO2 yield. The intensive characterization of used OCs revealed that the proper Mn-doping helped on the increase of d-spacing, corresponding to more highcharge Mn ions and improved oxygen-ion migration and oxygen activation, and thus greater oxygen evolution reaction performance, and the incorporation of Mn in Mn/Ca2Fe2O5, leading the structural distortion of octahedral Fe-O bond and the stronger oxycarbide adsorption ability. Studies confirmed the correspondence of 20MnCaFe to its capabilities of optimal oxygen uncoupling, catalytic conversion of CO2 to CO and the coordinated oxidability, resulting in the improvement of syngas quality. A clear reaction pathway involving Mn/ Ca2Fe2O5 in CLG is exhibit, that is oxygen uncoupling, CO2 catalytic conversion, the regeneration of oxygen uncoupling vacancy and finally recoverable oxygen uncoupling.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0016-2361	1873-7153		WOS:000874642800002

The key point is design and synthesis of low cost and efficient materials for a wide variety of electrochemical reactions. Over the past ten years, two-dimensional(2D) nanomaterials that graphene represents have been paid much attention as a class of the most promising candidates for heterogeneous electrocatalysts in electrochemical storage and conversion. Their unique properties, such as good chemical stability, good flexibility, and good electronic properties, along with their nano-sized thickness and large specific area, make them exhibit comprehensively good performances for energy storage and conversion.

Herein, we reported a "one for two" strategy to prepare NiCo2S4 nanorods directly grown on carbon cloth (NiCo2S4@CC) via a simply modified MOFs-derived approach for high-performance asymmetric supercapacitors and efficient oxygen evolution reaction (OER). As an electrode for asymmetric supercapacitors, the NiCo2S4@CC electrode showed excellent electrochemical performance with high specific capacitance and good rate capability. The asymmetric supercapacitor using NiCo2S4@CC as a cathode electrode and N-doped porous carbon nanosheets grown on the CC (NC@CC ) as an anode electrode achieved a superior energy density and power density and a long cycle life. Furthermore, the NiCo2S4@CC exhibited a notable electrocatalytic activity as an electrocatalyst for OER. The remarkable electrochemical performance of as-prepared NiCo2S4@CC could be mainly attributed to its hierarchical structure, sufficient active sites and low metal-anion bond energy after sulfuration reaction. This work could provide an unprecedented opportunity to fabricate functional materials under rational design for various applications. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

Here we report a nano-size IrOx/Nafion(center dot) composite catalyst that exhibits both outstanding activity for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and stability in a PEM water electrolyzer. The IrOx/Nafion(center dot) catalyst layer is fabricated using a flame-based cost-effect process, reactive spray deposition technology. The IrOx/Nafion(center dot) catalyst shows > 10 times improvement in OER mass activity compared to IrOx nanoparticles synthesized using the wet chemistry method. The IrOx/Nafion(center dot) catalyst also achieved similar to 4,500 h of stable operation in MEA electrolyzer at 1.8 A cm(-2) and 80 degrees C with ultra-low iridium loading of 0.08 mg cm(-2). Analysis of the IrOx structure and the electrochemical performance revealed three key factors for balancing high stability and activity: (1) high ratio of Ir (IV) to Ir (III) species and high content of hydroxide on the surface; (2) high anodic charge and surface area due to nano-size IrOx particles that are well-dispersed in the Nafion ionomer electrolyte; (3) homogeneous anode catalyst layer morphology.									80	3	0	0	2	0	82			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000446283800015

In this context, we report the characterization of hydrothermally prepared iridium(III/IV) oxohydroxides that exhibit exceptional OER performances. Holes in the O2p states of the iridium(III/IV) oxohydroxides result in reactive OI- species, which are identified by characteristic near-edge X-ray absorption fine structure (NEXAFS) features. A prototypical titration reaction with CO as a probe molecule shows that these OI- species are highly susceptible to nucleophilic attack at room temperature. Similarly to the preactivated oxygen involved in the biological OER in photosystemII, the electrophilic OI- species evidenced in the iridium(III/IV) oxohydroxides are suggested to be precursors to species involved in the O-O bond formation during the electrocatalytic OER. The CO titration also highlights a link between the OER performance and the surface/subsurface mobility of the OI- species. Thus, the superior electrocatalytic properties of the iridium (III/IV) oxohydroxides are explained by their ability to accommodate preactivated electrophilic OI- species that can migrate within the lattice.									27	1	0	0	2	0	27			1864-5631	1864-564X		WOS:000417561000015	28941180

The present study focuses on the chemical resistance under electrochemical oxidative conditions, which occur under oxygen-involving reactions like oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The electrochemical performance of glassy carbon investigated in alkaline, neutral and acidic media reveal the same chemical processes during the OER but showing different degradation mechanism.The electrochemical signature of the corrosion in different media could be directly associated with the formation of oxygen functional groups determined by spectroscopic methods like Raman, infrared (IR) and x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The morphology change of the carbon surface caused by carbon oxidation was investigated by microscopy. A rough surface was obtained in the acidic case, whereas dents were seen in alkaline media.It is assumed that the glassy carbon electrode in acidic media degrades by forming surface oxides by acid catalyzed process leading to ring opening in the graphitic structure and therefore oxidation in the bulk. In alkaline media OH radicals preferentially react with alkyl site chains, leading to oxidation of the edges of carbon layers until they become hydrophilic and dissolve.					4th Ertl Symposium on Water at Interfaces4th Ertl Symposium on Water at Interfaces	OCT 11-13, 2016OCT 11-13, 2016	Fritz Haber Inst Max Planck Gesell; GIST Ertl CtrFritz Haber Inst Max Planck Gesell; GIST Ertl Ctr	Berlin, GERMANYBerlin, GERMANY	234	5	0	0	26	0	234			0920-5861	1873-4308		WOS:000407247800005

However, for most electrocatalysts, the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) can only work efficiently in neutral solution or alkaline solution, which hinders their further applications using untreated natural waters with a wide pH range, such as seawater (pH similar to 7.5-8.5). In this paper, we report the synthesis of core-shell MoS2@CoO bifunctional electrocatalysts. The MoS2@CoO-coated carbon cloth electrode demonstrates excellent electrocatalytic properties for both OER and HER with 325 and 173 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) and Tafel slopes of 129.9 and 83.0 mV dec(-1) in 1 M KOH solutions, respectively. Additionally, the electrode can also work efficiently in neutral solutions (1 M PBS, pH = 7), showing good OER and HER activities for potential electrocatalytic water splitting applications in untreated natural waters.									26	5	0	0	1	0	29			1932-7447			WOS:000461537400003

Synchrotron radiation characterizations can obtain the local atomic coordination environment and electron information of specific elements in materials. In particular, in-situ characterization methods can monitor the dynamic evolution of surface oxidation state and local atomic structure transformation under working conditions, which can promote the fundamental understanding of the reaction mechanism. In this review, we discuss recent advances and propose some perspectives in self-reconstruction of OER electrocatalysts, which mainly summarizes the fundamental origin of self-reconstruction behavior and the application of in-situ synchrotron radiation characterization technology to track the dynamic process of self-reconstruction process and to identify the true active sites.

One example is metal hangman-porphyrines (MHP), which recently have been suggested for oxygen reduction/evolution reaction (ORR/OER). The unique properties of the MHPs are attributed to both the hangman scaffold and the C6F5 side groups. Herein, the OER/ORR over various transition metal MHPs is investigated by density functional theory calculations within an electrochemical framework. A comparison of the reaction landscape for MHP, metal porphyrine (MP) and metaltetrafluorophenyloporphyrines (MTFPP), allow for a disentanglement of the different roles of the hangman motif and the side groups. In agreement with experimental studies, it is found that Fe and Co are the best MHP Metal centers to catalyze these reactions. We find that the addition of the three-dimensional moiety in the form of hangman scaffold does not break the apparently universal energy relation between *OH and *OOH intermediates. However, the hangman motif is found to stabilize the oxygen intermediate, whereas addition of C6F5 groups reduces the binding energy of all reaction intermediates.

Herein, amorphous RhPb nanoflowers (a-RhPb NFs) are synthesized through one-step hydrothermal reaction, in which CO is derived from decomposition of formaldehyde as a reducing agent and structure directing agent. Benefiting from 3D nanoflower-like morphology, amorphous structure, and strong electronic interaction, the a-RhPb NFs show excellent catalytic performance for hydrogen evolution and hydrazine oxidation reactions, requiring overpotentials of -36 and 18 mV to achieve the current density of 10 mA cm-2, respectively. Inspiringly, when a-RhPb NFs serve as bifunctional electrocatalysts for hydrazine-assisted water splitting, low potentials of 0.095 and 0.321 mV are achieved at 10 and 100 mA cm-2, respectively. This study offers an attractive approach to synthesize amorphous bimetallic electrocatalysts towards efficient hydrogen production and beyond.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000783569700002

Herein, we report the synthesis of a hierarchical structure, assembled with Co, Zn, N-codoped carbon nanotube arrays branched out from one-dimensional (1D) molybdenum carbide (MoCoZn/NCNTA) as an effective bifunctional electrocatalyst. Owing to the synergistic effect among Co@NCNTA, 1D molybdenum carbide and the Zn dopants, the optimized MoCoZn/NCNTA has excellent bifunctional activities with a high half-wave potential of 0.914 V towards oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and a small overpotential of 445 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) towards oxygen evolution reaction (OER). When used as an air-cathode catalyst for rechargeable zinc-air battery, the MoCoZn/NCNTA-based zinc-air battery exhibits excellent energy storage and conversion performance with a large power density, high round-trip efficiency and robust cycling stability, outperforming benchmarked Pt/C-IrO2 mixture-based battery. This work provides a rational pathway for fabricating effective bifunctional electrocatalyst for high-performance metal-air battery. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

The test results show that Sr-doped La1-xSrxCoO3 has higher electrocatalytic activities than LaCoO3. In addition, La0.6Sr0.4CoO3 reveal excellent catalytic activity for the oxygen evolution reaction and oxygen reduction reaction, reaching a maximum of 0.244 A.cm(-2) (at 0.6 V vs Hg/HgO) and 0.303 A.cm(-2) (at 1 V vs Hg/HgO). In order to further improve the catalytic activity of the catalyst, alpha-MnO2 nano-wires as bi-functional catalyst was prepared by hydrothermal synthesis and added into the La0.6Sr0.4CoO3. The activities of bi-functional catalysts of alpha-MnO2/La0.6Sr0.4CoO3 were markedly superior compared with a-MnO2 or La0.6Sr0.4CoO3 perovskite oxide when the mass fraction of 40% alpha-MnO2, demonstrating a synergistic effect, which was responsible for the improvement of electrochemical catalytic activity and stability of the bifunctional oxygen electrode.									2	1	0	0	0	0	2			1001-4861			WOS:000429759200009

In this paper, we designed the SnC/HfS2 heterojunction and explored its electronic structure and photocatalytic properties for water splitting based on first-principles calculations. Our results suggest that SnC/HfS2 heterostructure is a typical direct Z-scheme heterojunction, which can effectively separate carriers and possesses strong oxidation and reduction capabilities. The valence band maximum of SnC is close to the conduction band minimum of HfS2, which is in favor of the recombination of inter-layer carriers. The very small interlayer band gap and appropriate built-in electric field direction make the migration of electrons and holes along the Z-path. The photo-generated electrons on SnC make the hydrogen evolution reaction happen continuously, while the photo-generated holes on HfS2 make the oxygen evolution reaction happen continuously. The calculation of the reaction energy barrier indicates that the procedure of photocatalytic water splitting on the SnC/HfS2 heterojunction can be spontaneous. Our results show that SnC/HfS2 heterojunction is a potential direct Z-scheme photocatalyst for the overall decomposition of water.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0022-3727	1361-6463		WOS:000799481300001

In this study, a series of hierarchical trimetallic LDHs composed of monolayer nanosheets are fabricated from oxalate metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) grown on copper foil by in-situ conformal transformation. LDHs maintain the octahedron morphology of MOFs, which is composed of ultrathin nanosheets. TEM and AFM images reveal that the thickness of the LDHs nanosheet approaches to 1 nm. These hierarchical trimetallic LDHs exhibit excellent activity and stability towards oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in alkaline electrolytes. Among them, FeCo0.5Ni0.5-LDH show the smallest overpotential of 248 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) with a small Tafel slope of 38 mV dec(-1), which is competitive to most reported catalysts.

In this work, we have shown that the decomposition of LiOH by ruthenium metal catalysts in a wet DMSO electrolyte occurs at the catalyst-electrolyte interface, initiated via a potential-triggered dissolution/reprecipitation process. The in situ UV-vis methodology devised herein provides direct experimental evidence that the hydroxyl radical is a common reaction intermediate formed in several nonaqueous electrolytes; this method is applicable to study other battery systems. Our results highlight that the reactivity of the hydroxyl radical toward nonaqueous electrolyte represents a major factor limiting O-2 evolution during LiOH decomposition. Coupling catalysts restraining hydroxyl reactivity with electrolytes more resistant to hydroxyl radical attack could help improve the reversibility of this reaction.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			1948-7185			WOS:000742729200001	34995456

Thus, they are considered promising electrocatalytic materials. In this work, a novel hierarchical porous nanocomposite of cobalt phosphide nanocage@ferric-zinc mixed-metal phosphide nanotubes (denoted CoP@ZnFeP) was fabricated using a self-assembly approach. Because of their structural and compositional merits, the as-prepared phosphide hybrids have abundant catalytic active sites and high porosity for facile mass diffusion. In an alkaline electrolyte, the CoP@ZnFeP flower-like hybrids displayed enhanced catalytic activity for the hydrogen evolution reaction and the oxygen evolution reaction compared with a mechanical mixture of CoP and ZnFeP nanoparticles. The CoP@ZnFeP hierarchical nano composites also showed excellent activity for the overall water splitting reaction, yielding a water -splitting current of 10 mA/cm, on the application of just 1.6 V, as well as excellent durability (24-h long-term operation) in a two-electrode system. Our design methodology may create opportunities to search for highly efficient and robust non-precious metal catalysts with applications in high-performance energy conversion and storage devices.

While delocalization lowers the energy of the carrier through its kinetic energy, localization creates a polarization around the carrier that traps it in a potential energy minimum. The trapped carrier and its local distortion-termed a polaron in solids-can play a role as a highly reactive intermediate within energy-storing catalytic reactions but is rarely discussed as such. Here, we present this perspective of the polaron as a catalytic intermediate through recent in situ and time-resolved spectroscopic investigations of photo-triggered electrochemical reactions at material surfaces. The focus is on hole-trapping at metal-oxygen bonds, denoted M-OH*, in the context of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) from water. The potential energy surface for the hole-polaron defines the structural distortions from the periodic lattice and the resulting "active" site of catalysis. This perspective will highlight how current and future time-resolved, multi-modal probes can use spectroscopic signatures of M-OH* polarons to obtain kinetic and structural information on the individual reaction steps of OER. A particular motivation is to provide the background needed for eventually relating this information to relevant catalytic descriptors by free energies. Finally, the formation of the O-O chemical bond from the consumption of M-OH*, required to release O-2 and store energy in H-2, will be discussed as the next target for experimental investigations.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			1463-9076	1463-9084		WOS:000695152300001	34514488

A facile bioreductive synthesis is described for Au nanoparticles (ca. 20 nm) supported on N-doped carbon (Au@NC), which was derived from Au/Pycnoporus sanguineus cells. The interface and charge transport between Au and N-doped carbon were confirmed by HRTEM and XPS. Au@NC was employed as an electrocatalyst for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), exhibiting a small onset potential of -54.1 mV (vs. RHE), a Tafel slope of 76.8 mV dec(-1), as well as robust stability in acidic medium. Au@NC is a multifunctional electrocatalyst, which demonstrates high catalytic activity in the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), as evidenced by an onset potential of +0.97 V, excellent tolerance toward methanol, and long-term stability. This work exemplifies dual recovery of precious Au and fabrication of multifunctional electrocatalysts in an environmentally benign and application-oriented manner.									80	8	0	0	9	0	81			1433-7851	1521-3773		WOS:000383253300042	27218302

Herein, we report a superaerophobic three dimensional (3D) heterostructured nanowrinkles of bimetallic selenides consisting of crystalline NiSe2 and NiFe2Se4 grown on NiFe alloy (NiSe2/NiFe2Se4@NiFe) prepared by a thermal selenization procedure. In this unique 3D heterostructure, numerous nanowrinkles of NiSe2/NiFe2Se4 hybrid with a thickness of 100 nm are grown on NiFe alloy in a uniform manner. Profiting by the large active surface area and high electronic conductivity, the superaerophobic NiSe2/NiFe2Se4@NiFe heterostructure exhibits excellent electrocatalytic activity and durability towards OER in alkaline media, outputting the low potentials of 1.53 and 1.54 V to achieve ultra-high current densities of 500 and 1000 mA cm(-2), respectively, which is among the most active Ni/Fe-based selenides, and even superior to the benchmark Ir/C catalyst. The in-situ derived FeOOH and NiOOH species from NiSe2/NiFe2Se4@NiFe are deemed to be efficient active sites for OER.									65	5	0	0	2	0	66			2311-6706	2150-5551		WOS:000531404000001	34138090

Electrocatalytic activity of Sr3Fe2O7 was found to be dependent on temperature and the overpotential for water oxidation markedly decreased at 70 degrees C, compared to 30 degrees C. Namely, at pH 7, O-2 evolution initiated with overpotential of approximately 100 mV and 300 mV at 70 and 30 degrees C, respectively. When a lanthanum-substituted Sr3Fe2O7, Sr2.6La0.4Fe2O7, was used as an O-2 evolution catalyst, this unique behavior of temperature dependence disappeared and O-2 evolution was driven with low overpotential even at 30 degrees C. These results suggest that the formation of Fe4+ is probably important to decrease in the overpotential for water oxidation to produce O-2.

Herein, a facile strategy is demonstrated to rationally construct CoFe Prussian blue analogues (PBA)@CoP cube-on-sheet hierarchical structure by etching reaction with intermediated CoO to form PBA nanocubes. Benefitting from the heterostructured engineering, the as-synthesized CoFe PBA@CoP presents remarkable electrocatalytic performance in 1.0 m KOH, only requiring overpotentials of 100 mV for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and 171 mV for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) to reach the 10 mA cm(-2) current density with good stability. Extraordinarily enhanced electrocatalytic performance is ascribed to not only the rapid charge transfer of active species, but also the synergistic effect between each component to achieve tuned electronic structure and abundant electrocatalytic active sites. Especially, the assembled two-electrode cell using CoFe PBA@CoP as both cathode and anode delivers the current densities of 10 mA cm(-2) at a relatively low cell voltage of 1.542 V, outperforming most of low-cost bifunctional electrocatalysts reported to date. The controllable and versatile strategy will open up an avenue to prepare hybrid films for advanced electrochemical energy storage and conversion.									11	1	0	0	3	0	12			2366-9608			WOS:000655778900001	34927988

Nickel/iron (NiFe)-based compounds have been known as active OER catalysts since the last century, and renewed interest has been witnessed in recent years on developing advanced NiFe-based materials for better activity and stability. In this review, we present the early discovery and recent progress on NiFe-based OER electrocatalysts in terms of chemical properties, synthetic methodologies and catalytic performances. The advantages and disadvantages of each class of NiFe-based compounds are summarized, including NiFe alloys, electrodeposited films and layered double hydroxide nanoplates.

While experimental and theoretical efforts have been critical in understanding the role of oxygen nonbonding states in the redox activity of oxygen ions, a clear picture of the redox chemistry of the oxygen species formed upon this oxidation process is still missing. This can be, in part, explained by the complexity in stabilizing and studying these species once electrochemically formed. In this work, we alleviate this difficulty by studying the phase Ba5Ru2O11, which contains peroxide O-2(2-) groups, as oxygen evolution reaction electrocatalyst and Li-ion battery material. Combining physical characterization and electrochemical measurements, we demonstrate that peroxide groups can easily be oxidized at relatively low potential, leading to the formation of gaseous dioxygen and to the instability of the oxide. Furthermore, we demonstrate that, owing to the stabilization at high energy of peroxide, the high-lying energy of the empty sigma* antibonding O-O states limits the reversibility of the electrochemical reactions when the O-2(2-)/O2- redox couple is used as redox center for Li-ion battery materials or as OER redox active sites. Overall, this work suggests that the formation of true peroxide O-2(2-) states are detrimental for transition metal oxides used as OER catalysts and Li-ion battery materials. Rather, oxygen species with O-O bond order lower than 1 would be preferred for these applications.									6	0	0	0	1	0	6			0897-4756	1520-5002		WOS:000435416600038	30057438

Here we present a series of robust electrodes by electrodepositing RuCo and RuCoMox alloys on Ti foil substrates for hydrogen evolution from seawater splitting. The preliminary results demonstrate that Ti foil supported RuCo and RuCoMox alloy electrodes require overpotentials of similar to 387 and similar to 550 mV to drive the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) at a benchmark current density of 10 mA cm(-2), respectively. Moreover, the resultant Ti foil supported RuCoMox electrode shows excellent stability under persistent operation at a constant current density of -1.2 V over 12 h. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

The synthesis of unique Co-Ru-MoS2 hybrid nanosheets with excellent catalytic activity toward overall water splitting in alkaline solution is reported. 1T ' phase MoS2 nanosheets are doped homogeneously with Co atoms and decorated with Ru nanoparticles. The catalytic performance of hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is characterized by low overpotentials of 52 and 308 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) and Tafel slopes of 55 and 50 mV decade(-1) in 1.0 m KOH, respectively. Analysis of X-ray photoelectron and absorption spectra of the catalysts show that the MoS2 well retained its metallic 1T ' phase, which guarantees good electrical conductivity during the reaction. The Gibbs free energy calculation for the reaction pathway in alkaline electrolyte confirms that the Ru nanoparticles on the Co-doped MoS2 greatly enhance the HER activity. Water adsorption and dissociation take place favorably on the Ru, and the doped Co further catalyzes HER by making the reaction intermediates more favorable. The high OER performance is attributed to the catalytically active RuO2 nanoparticles that are produced via oxidation of Ru nanoparticles.									46	2	0	0	0	0	46			1613-6810	1613-6829		WOS:000523482400002	32147958

But CoFeCoO4 was not explored widely like ZnCo2O4 (or NiCo2O4) as the ORR electrocatalyst for its relatively complicated atomic site occupation. CoFeCoO4 has a typical cubic spinel structure with Co2+ in the tetrahedron and Co3+ and Fe3+ in the octahedron. A mixture of Co3+ and Fe3+ in the B site makes the oxide have a wider overlap between transition metal 3d orbit and O 2p orbit, which can lead to an effective charge transfer in the rate-determining steps of ORR process and then enhance the ORR activity. The high electronic conductivity and specific surface area of rGO can accelerate charger transfer and provide more catalytic sites, which would contribute to a faster ORR process. In this work, the porous spindle CoFeCoO4 microparticles which were synthesized by hydrothermal technology, were assembled on the rGO surface to obtain the CoFeCoO4/rGO composite, which exhibited enhanced ORR activity and catalytic stability comparable to that of Pt/C. On the other hand, the OER catalytic activity of the prepared samples was also studied to explore the potential of CoFeCoO4/rGO as a bifunctional oxygen catalyst.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1793-2920			KJD:ART002463650

Many difficulties in the realization of the real role of ROS in vital activity are caused by the attitude to them only as to chemical substances, while they should be considered in the first place as the major participants of continuous flows of highly non-linear processes in which electron excited species emerge. These processes play a significant role in energy and informational flows in all the living systems. We suggest that the mechanisms of biological action of ROS are determined by the structural patterns (frequency-amplitude patterns of electron excited states generation and their relaxation) of the processes with ROS participation taking place in the aqueous environs. Energy released in such reactions is used as an activation energy for specific biochemical processes, for the continuous "pumping" of the non-equilibrium state of inter- and intracellular structural components, while the structural patterns of ROS reactions determine biochemical and physiological rhythmic modes. Special role of water in all these phenomena is discussed. From a broader perspective the processes with ROS participation emerging in water preceded and were the necessary condition for origination and evolution of organic living forms on Earth.									4	0	3	0	3	0	7			0035-6050			WOS:000288778400008	21384328

Herein, NiCoS2 nanoparticles well decorated on double-sided N-doped reduced graphene oxide sheets (NiCoS2/rGO) are prepared from an Al-containing ternary NiCoAl-layered double hydroxide precursor (NiCoAl-LDH) grown on GO support as an OER electrocatalyst. The Al-confinement-assisted sulfurization, followed by selective acid treatment, endows the resulting NiCoS2/rGO composite with the advantages: well-dispersed NiCoS2 nanoparticles, dual-sided rGO support, as well as a large specific surface area of 119.4 m(2)center dot g(-1) and meso-/macroporous size distribution. The NiCoS2/rGO electrocatalyst exhibits an overpotential of 273 mV at 10 mA center dot cm(-2) and a good stability of 24 h, which outperform those of the counterparts of NiS2/rGO and CoS2/rGO. The results of electrochemical active surface area and electrochemical impedance spectra experimentally provide convincing rationales of the information of active sites and good conductivity, both underpin the enhanced electrocatalytic performances.									17	0	0	0	1	0	17			1001-0521	1867-7185		WOS:000648841500003

However, the electrocatalytic activity of perovskite oxides towards the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) must be improved by increasing the slow kinetics and by decreasing the overpotential associated with those reactions. Doping with other transition metals such as Ni, Mn, Fe and Cu represents one of the effective chemical methods to improve the catalytic activity of perovskite oxides. Herein, we investigate Ni-doped cobalt-based double perovskites, PrBa0.5Sr0.5Co2-xNixO5+delta (x=0, 0.1, 0.2 and 0.3), as promising cathode materials for rechargeable alkaline Zn-air batteries. PrBa0.5Sr0.5Co1.9Ni0.1O5+delta (PBSCN1) shows low Tafel slopes (OER: 83 mV dec(-1) and ORR: 67 mV dec(-1)), favorable onset potentials (OER: 1.513 V vs. RHE at 1 mA cm(-2) and ORR: 0.720 V vs. RHE at -1 mA cm(-2)), and high limiting currents (OER: 25.20 mA cm(-2) and ORR: -5.67 mA cm(-2)). In addition, it shows improved discharge-charge performances for a full-cell Zn-air battery. The enhanced electrochemical properties of PBSCN1 could be achieved by the high concentration of surface oxygen species, and the coexistence of different chemical states of cobalt cations caused by the presence of nickel cations in the lattice. Based on these results, PrBa0.5Sr0.5Co1.9Ni0.1O5+delta could be considered a promising cathode material for Zn-air battery systems.									11	2	0	0	1	0	11			2196-0216			WOS:000475465600025

Here, we develop a dipole-scheme (D-scheme for short) photocatalytic model and materials realization from first-principles dipole calculations. The D-scheme heterojunction not only can effectively separate electrons and holes by large polarization fields, but also boosts photocatalytic redox reactions with high driving photovoltages and with less carrier loss. After developing the D-scheme model, we then theoretically propose a D-scheme heterojunction prototype with two real polar materials, PtSeTe/LiGaS2. Such D-scheme photocatalyst exhibits a high capability of the photogenerated carrier separation and near-infrared light absorption. Moreover, our calculations of Gibbs free energies imply a high ability of hydrogen evolution reaction and oxygen evolution reaction by a large driving force. The proposed D-scheme photocatalytic model is generalized and paves a valuable route for significantly improving the photocatalytic efficiency.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000818654800005

In this case, carbon corrosion occurs. Oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalysts can alleviate carbon corrosion by introducing water electrolysis at a lower potential at the anode in fuel shortage. The mixture of hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR) and unsupported OER catalyst not only reduces the electrolysis efficiency, but also influences the initial performance of the fuel cell. Herein, Ti4O7 supported IrOx is synthesized by utilizing the surfactant-assistant method and serves as reversal tolerant components in the anode. When the cell reverse time is less than 100 min, the cell voltage of the MEA added with IrOx/Ti4O7 has almost no attenuation. Besides, the MEA has a longer reversal time (530 min) than IrOx (75 min), showing an excellent reversal tolerance. The results of electron microscopy spectroscopy show that IrOx particles have a good dispersity on the surface of Ti4O7 and IrOx/Ti4O7 particles are uniformly dispersed on the anode catalytic layer. After the stability test, the Ti4O7 support has little decay, demonstrating a high electrochemical stability. IrOx/Ti4O7 with a high dispersity has a great potential to the application on the reversal tolerance anode of the fuel cell.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2095-1701	2095-1698		WOS:000739269300001

Herein, a promising and highly effective hydroxyl ions hungry electrode structure was prepared for the first time via a two-step hydrothermal reaction procedure to enhance the surface adsorption kinetics to obtain an ultralow overpotential. The electrode exhibits OER activity with ultralow overpotentials of 203 mV and 293 mV at the current densities of 10 mA cm(-2) and 100 mA cm(-2), respectively, in 1.0 M KOH.

Development of non-noble metal bifunctional electrocatalysts for the hydrogen evolution reaction and 2e(-) oxygen reduction reaction to ease reaction kinetics is a challenging task. Integration of single components by employing easy strategies provides a key step toward the realization of highly active electrocatalysts. In this vein, MoSe2 owns catalytic active sites and a high specific surface area but suffers from insufficient conductivity and high catalytic performance that noble metals provide. Herein, MoSe2 was used as a platform for the incorporation of manganese-metalated porphyrin (MnP). The developed hybrid, namely, MoSe2-MnP, obtained by the initial metal-ligand coordination and the subsequent grafting with MnP was fully characterized and electrochemically assessed. The bifunctional electrocatalyst lowered the overpotential toward hydrogen evolution, improved the reaction kinetics and charge transfer processes, and was extremely stable after 10,000 ongoing cycles. Simultaneously, rotating ring disk electrode analysis showed that oxygen reduction proceeds through the 2e(-) pathway for the selective production of hydrogen peroxide with a high yield of 97%. The new facile modification route can be applied in diverse transition metal dichalcogenides and will help the development of new advanced functional materials.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1932-7447	1932-7455		WOS:000848495600001

The amount of Ag+ adsorbed on the surface of AgCl correlates with the photoreactivity of the system. The concentration of Ag+ in the Ag+/Na+ zeolite A cages influences the rate at which oxygen is produced and determines the total amount formed. The reaction depends on the water partial pressure and the system shows self-sensitisation of the photochemical oxidation of water to oxygen, which means that new photoactive colour centres are formed under near UV illumination.

Therefore, a more easily oxidized urea oxidation reaction (UOR) has been implemented to replace OER. Co-Mo-based bimetallic oxides have been recognized as interesting candidates for electrocatalytic water splitting due to their unique d electron configurations, but the low conductivity and limited active sites still hinder their development. Herein, we demonstrated that anion-modulation in CoMoO4 nanoplates as coupled hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and UOR for convenient and efficient urea-assisted hydrogen-production system are demonstrated. The findings of the experiments show that nitrogen doping and phosphorus doping exhibit excellent activity toward alkaline HER and UOR, respectively. As a result, the N-CoMoO4 and P-CoMoO4 electrode exhibit low potentials of-0.062 V and 1.251 V (vs. RHE) to reach a current of 10 mA cm-2 for HER and UOR. The full urea electrolysis is driven by N-CoMoO4||P-CoMoO4 executes stably for 24 h at a low potential of 1.41 V. This is a unique anion-modulation method in electrocatalysts to combine hydrogen generation and sewage treatment, which could pave the way for the creation of long-term energy conversion systems.(c) 2022 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC.

Australian dairy industry generates a large amount of expired milk powders every year, which are often dumped as food wastes. Here, we report a highly efficient bifunctional O-2 electrocatalyst by incorporating mixed metal oxide (NiFeOx) nanoparticles into N (8.5 at%) and P (1.9 at%) dually doped carbon materials derived from milk powders. This catalyst demonstrates an onset potential of 0.90 V vs. reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE), a kinetic limiting current density of 12.9 mA cm(-2) at 0.4 V vs. RHE, and an electron transfer number of 3.86 for ORR, it also shows an onset potential of 1.48 V vs. RHE, an overpotential of 0.32 V at 10 mA cm(-2), a Tafel slope of 59.03 mV/dec in 1.0 M KOH for OER. Its catalytic performance is comparable to that of the best metal-free carbon-based ORR electrocatalysts and OER electrocatalysts based on hybrids of metal oxides and carbon materials. Rechargeable Zn-air batteries were also fabricated using air electrodes made of this catalyst, demonstrating an open-circuit potential of 1.39 V, a specific capacity of 688 mAh g(-1) (corresponding to an energy density of 853 Wh kg(Zn)(-1)), and excellent rechargeability over 150 cycles with a small performance loss. The milk powder-derived carbon materials can be used to produce eco-friendly and high value-added electrocatalysts for energy conversion and storage applications while reducing food wastage.									37	1	0	0	1	0	37			2405-8297			WOS:000425894300018

Herein, Ni-S-CoFe2O4 magnetic nanosheets supported on Ni Foam (MagnNi-S-CoFe2O4/NF) as highly active OER electrocatalysts are synthesized via an extremely simple magnetic-field guided co-electrodeposition strategy. With the application of magnetic fields, the flowerlike structures consisting of numerous nanosheets are obtained. This special interconnected structure can effectively reduce the transfer resistance to electrons during catalysis. The ultra-thin amorphous Ni-S layer at the edge of well-defined crystalline CoFe2O4 provides more active sites for the reaction because of the abundant defects, which greatly enhances the OER performance. At the same time, the application of magnetic fields changes the chemical state of the electrocatalyst. The well-designed MagnNi-S-CoFe2O4/NF exhibits excellent OER activity with a low overpotential of 228 mV at the current density of 10 mA cm(-2), which is lower than the value of 253 mV for the Ni-S-CoFe2O4/NF without applied magnetic field, a small Tafel slope of 72 mV dec(-1) and excellent stability for at least 24 h. This work provides a simple magnetic field-assisted synthesis method to prepare electrocatalysts with excellent OER activity. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

Here, we report a 3D porous nitrogen doped carbon (PNC) electrocatalyst with superior HER and ORR electrocatalytic activities derived from the calcination of the discarded cigarette butt and dicyandiamide possessing a high nitrogen content (20 at%). PNC electrocatalyst only demands 143 mV versus RHE to achieve 10 mA cm(-2) ascribed to the high nitrogen percentile in PNC electrocatalyst favorable for constructing successive active centers contributing to efficiently catalyzing HER. Ignorable degradation in HER activity observed after 10000 potential cycles as well as undetectable decay in HER performance recorded after 12 h operation indicate high stability of PNC electrocatalyst. Meanwhile, half-wave potential of PNC electrocatalyst reaches 0.81 V versus RHE in 1 M KOH electrolyte. Additionally, stable ORR activity attained after 1000 potential cycles is indicative of high stability. A comparably high zinc-air battery performance with maximum power density of 66 mW cm(-2) is achieved by PNC electrocatalyst. This study highlights the importance of nitrogen doping level in metal-free electrocatalyst for boosting HER and ORR activities.									28	1	0	0	2	0	28			1867-3880	1867-3899		WOS:000451444000014

ACS CATALYSIS				10	19			11177	11234		10.1021/acscatal.0c01862				OCT 2 2020	2020	Water splitting through the use of (photo)electrocatalysts is a carbon-free route to sustainably produce hydrogen gas for use in various applications, such as ammonia and methanol synthesis, hydrotreating of petroleum and biomass, and clean electricity production in fuel cells. Over the past few decades, many candidate materials (e.g., metals and their oxides, nitrides, sulfides, and phosphides) in various 2D and 3D architectures and structures (e.g., layered double hydroxides and oxyhydroxides, rutiles, spinels, and perovskites) have been evaluated for catalyzing the two half-reactions involved in water splitting: hydrogen and oxygen evolution. Moreover, these materials are used under varied operating conditions, such as low and high temperatures, pressures, and solution pH, and in the presence or absence of sunlight. Accordingly, it is valuable to examine why the materials and process conditions currently in use were explored in the first place and why some of them are more promising than others. Given the difficulties associated with experimentally characterizing electrode-electrolyte interfaces in situ, theory can be a valuable partner for gaining insight into intermediate structures, reaction mechanisms, and ultimately catalyst design. Here, we focus on how theoretical studies of crucial materials properties, such as optoelectronic properties (e.g., band gaps, band edge positions, and the kinetics of charge-carrier separation and transport), adsorption and reaction energetics, and (photo)electrochemical stability, inform the success of existing and yet-to-be-discovered (photo)electrocatalysts. We also highlight other research directions important for theoretical (photo)electrocatalyst discovery, such as the quantification of reaction kinetics versus thermodynamics, investigation of the influence of defects and surface reconstructions on (photo)electrocatalytic materials properties, and the use of data science strategies (e.g., high-throughput simulations, statistical regression, and machine learning) to accelerate the development of new materials for water splitting applications.									46	2	0	0	2	0	46			2155-5435			WOS:000577156300033

The structure and composition of the assynthesized samples were characterized by XRD, XPS and SEM technique. The Fe-Ni3S2/NF shows excellent electrocatalytic activity toward both hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Moreover, assembled as an electrolyzer for overall water splitting, this material delivers a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at a quite low cell voltage of 1.59 V, and it also shows remarkable stability for continuously working over 24 h with nearly negligible deactivation.

Neutral-pH OER reduces operational risks and enables direct coupling to electrochemical CO2 reduction, but typically is hampered by low current densities. Here, the rate limitations in neutral-pH OER are clarified. Using cobalt-based catalyst films and phosphate ions as essential electrolyte bases, current-potential curves are recorded and simulated. Operando X-ray spectroscopy shows the potential-dependent structural changes independent of the electrolyte phosphate concentration. Operando Raman spectroscopy uncovers electrolyte acidification at a micrometer distance from the catalyst surface, limiting the Tafel slope regime to low current densities. The electrolyte proton transport is facilitated by diffusion of either phosphate ions (base pathway) or H3O+ ions (water pathway). The water pathway is not associated with an absolute current limit but is energetically inefficient due to the Tafel-slope increase by 60 mV dec(-1), shown by an uncomplicated mathematical model. The base pathway is a specific requirement in neutral-pH OER and can support high current densities, but only with accelerated buffer-base diffusion. Catalyst internal phosphate diffusion or other internal transport mechanisms do not limit the current densities. A proof-of-principle experiment shows that current densities exceeding 1 A cm(-2) can also be achieved in neutral-pH OER.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1614-6832	1614-6840		WOS:000868145500001

Herein, we discover that coupling water-dissociation-active FeOOH with MoS2 grown on Ni3S2 nanowire arrays to achieve a core-shell Ni3S2@MoS2/FeOOH heterostructure can not only significantly accelerate the HER of MoS2, but also appreciably promote the OER activity of the catalyst. Systematic investigations on Ni3S2@MoS2/FeOOH and a series of delicately designed control catalysts reveal that such synergistically enhanced electrocatalytic performance for both OER and HER should be ascribed to the coupling effect and electronic modulation between FeOOH and MoS2. As a result, the prepared Ni3S2@MoS2/FeOOH exhibits small overpotentials of 95 mV for HER and 234 mV for OER at 10 mA cm(-2). The alkaline electrolyzer using it as both anode and cathode only need a cell voltage of 1.57 V to output a stable current density of 10 mA cm(-2), enabling it as an efficient bifunctional electrocatalyst for alkaline overall water splitting. The present strategy opens up opportunities to develop new efficient electrocatalysts for diverse applications by coupling OER-active electron-modulating component with highly-active HER electrocatalyst or vice versa.									99	9	0	0	7	0	100			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000457952600103

With the help of an isostructural precursor of Co(OH)(2) and Ni(OH)(2), Ni2P clusters could be inlayed in CoP nanosheets. The extensive interface region between CoP and Ni2P caused by the lattice mismatch lowers the hydrogen bonding energy. Meanwhile, the boundaries on the surfaces create an opportunity for the CoP and Ni2P couple to exert a synergistic effect and promote the catalytic activity. The catalyst shows excellent electrochemical activity in acidic, neutral or alkaline solution, and it also has excellent performance for the oxygen evolution reaction. The electrochemical compatibility of the couple makes sure that the catalyst can work stably in a harsh catalysis environment. So, the full cell for electrochemical water splitting with the catalyst on both the anode and the cathode only needs 1.60 V to achieve a current density of 10 mA cm(-2).									11	1	0	0	1	0	12			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000509471800046

In this paper, we started with the catalysts of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) of electrocatalytic water splitting, studied the catalysts with great stability and practicality, and designed NiCo2O4 nanowires as precursors, on whose surface we set NiMoO4 nanosheets. Cobalt elements were introduced on the nickel foam with electrocatalytic properties, and a flower-like NiCo2O4@NiMoO4 core-shell hybrid nanostructure was prepared by a hydrothermal method. The series of core-shell nanocatalysts were characterized via XRD, SEM, XPS, etc. The electrochemical properties of the obtained catalysts were also measured, and the conclusion that the catalysts could reduce the overpotential of the reaction required was figured out.

Herein, a catalyst of Ni3S2-Co9S8 heterostructure nanowires supported on nickel foam is fabricated by a two-step hydrothermal method. The catalyst shows excellent OER activity with an overpotential of only 294 mV at 20 mA cm(-2), which may be attributed to the defective heterointerfaces between the metallic Co9S8 and Ni3S2 nanocrystalline grains. This efficient strategy for preparing Ni3S2-Co9S8 heterostructure catalyst can shed some light on the design of noble metal-free electrocatalysts. The performances for electrocatalytic oxidation of H2O2 on the electrodes are studied, and the results indicate that the step of -OOH oxidation in OER is a fast kinetics process and not the ratedetermining step.									18	1	0	0	0	0	18			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000566975200001

However, to date, no significant attention has been given to understand the chemical kinetics of the OER. Herein, the oxides of nickel and iron, and their heterostructure were chosen for the investigation. The electrocatalytic activity was found to augment synergistically when a heterostructure was formed between iron oxide and nickel oxide. The metal oxide catalyzed OER was an entropy-driven process and followed the peroxide linkage formation pathway. The rate-determining step was found to be different for the reactions catalyzed by different oxides. For the first time, Distribution of relaxation time (DRT) plots were utilized to study the chemical kinetics of OER, and the inference obtained from this analysis agreed well with the reaction mechanism. The kinetic barrier for the charge transfer process was found to decrease, and the surface group formation attained a moderate value after the heterostructure formation. These aspects had been the key player behind the synergistic increment in OER catalytic activity of the heterostructure. This investigation will lead a new pathway towards the development of strategies to understand the kinetics of an electrochemical reaction.									9	1	0	0	2	0	9			0013-4651	1945-7111		WOS:000555371300001

Herein, a novel strongly coupled ternary electrocatalyst of NiCu-layered double hydroxide (NiCu-LDH) on cobalt sulfide (CoS) and the material graphitic carbon nitride ( g-C3N4) was synthesized. In OER tests, NiCu-LDH@CoS/g-C3N4 electrocatalyst exhibited excellent performance using 1 M KOH alkaline electrolyte. In the present study, the electrode potential was only 290 mV for a current density of 10 mA/cm(2) and a Tafel slope of 75 mV/dec. The improved electrocatalytic activity was ascribed to the strong interaction and electronic coupling with efficient charge transfer at the CoS/g-C3N4 heterojunction interface and the enhanced electronic effects of NiCu-LDH at the NiCu-LDH@CoS/g-C3N4 interface. The optimized NiCu-LDH@CoS/g-C3N4 nanostructure was stable, with a 99.7% remarkable efficiency for the OER.

Monometallic phosphides such as Ni2P have been shown to be active toward OER, but their performance remains unsatisfactory. Herein, guided by the theoretical mechanism study of the intrinsic high electroactivity revealed in the d-band center (E-d) theory, the Fe-substituted Ni2P ((NixFe1-x)(2)P) nanosheets grown directly on NiFe foam are designed and synthesized. As OER electrocatalysts in alkaline media, the (NixFe1-x)(2)P nanosheets show an overpotential of 166 mV to deliver the current density of 10 mA cm(-2), which is superior to the Ni2P and most reported transition-metal-based catalysts. Combining DFT simulations with experiments reveals that the enhanced activity results from the moderate rise in E-d energy levels, which balances the adsorption and desorption capacities of the oxygen-containing intermediates (*O, *OH, and *OOH). This work supplies valuable insights for the rational design and construction of efficient doped electrocatalysts under the guidance of the d-band center theory.									176	4	0	0	16	0	173			2155-5435			WOS:000563749900010

Here, a new hierarchical Ni-Co oxide nanostructure, composed of small secondary nanosheets grown on primary nanosheet arrays, is synthesized via a topotactic transformation of Ni-Co layered double hydroxide. The Ni3+-rich surface benefits the formation of NiOOH, which is the main redox site as revealed via in situ X-ray absorption near edge structure and extended X-ray absorption fine structure spectroscopy. The Ni-Co oxide hierarchical nanosheets (NCO-HNSs) deliver a stable current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at an overpotential of approximate to 0.34 V for OER with a Tafel slope of as low as 51 mV dec(-1) in alkaline media. The improvement in the OER activity can be ascribed to the synergy of large surface area offered by the 3D hierarchical nanostructure and the facile formation of NiOOH as the main active sites on the surface of NCO-HNSs to decrease the overpotential and facilitate the catalytic reaction.									385	19	0	0	19	0	387			1614-6832	1614-6840		WOS:000354810400015

However, the reported HER activity of Ni3S2 is still unsatisfactory. Herein, 3D self-supported phosphorus-doped Ni3S2 nanosheet arrays on Ni foam (P-Ni3S2/NF) are synthesized by a simple one-step simultaneous phosphorization and sulfuration route and exhibit dramatically enhanced HER and OER activity. The introduction of P anions significantly optimized the hydrogen adsorption free energy (Delta G(H*)) and increased the electrochemical surface area (ECSA). Accordingly, the optimal P-Ni3S2/NF exhibits relatively low overpotentials of 101 mV and 256 mV to drive a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) for the HER and OER in 1 M KOH. The reported electrocatalyst activation approach by anion doping can be adapted for other transition metal chalcogenides for overall water splitting, offering great promise for future applications.									7	0	0	0	1	0	7			2044-4753	2044-4761		WOS:000589508300012

The porous structure induced advantages, such as a higher specific surface area, more efficient charge separation, and faster electron-transfer efficiency, enable the 3D porous g-C3N4 to achieve impressive properties as a bifunctional catalyst for both photocatalytic hydrogen evolution and electrocatalytic oxygen evolution reaction (OER). As a result, the 3D porous g-C3N4 exhibits a hydrogen evolution rate of 598 mu mol h(-1) g(-1) with an apparent quantum yield of 3.31% at 420 nm for photocatalytic H-2 generation, which is much higher than that of the bulk g-C3N4. Simultaneously, the porous g-C3N4 also presents an attractive OER performance with a low onset potential of 1.47 V (vs reversible hydrogen electrode) in an alkaline electrolyte after rational cobalt-doping. Accordingly, the NaCl-assisted ball-milling strategy paves the way to the rational design of a controllable porous structure.									56	8	0	0	6	0	59			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000479020300071	31286761

Density functional theory suggested that non-3d high-valency metals such as tungsten can modulate 3d metal oxides, providing nearoptimal adsorption energies for OER intermediates. We developed a room-temperature synthesis to produce gelled oxyhydroxides materials with an atomically homogeneous metal distribution. These gelled FeCoW oxyhydroxides exhibit the lowest overpotential (191 millivolts) reported at 10 milliamperes per square centimeter in alkaline electrolyte. The catalyst shows no evidence of degradation after more than 500 hours of operation. X-ray absorption and computational studies reveal a synergistic interplay between tungsten, iron, and cobalt in producing a favorable local coordination environment and electronic structure that enhance the energetics for OER.									1471	81	0	0	119	0	1489			0036-8075	1095-9203		WOS:000373990100038	27013427

TiO2, as a semiconductor material, is commonly not established as an active electrocatalyst for oxygen reduction and oxygen evolution due to its poor electrical conductivity and low reactivity. Here, we demonstrated that composites composed of TiO2 and N-doped graphene can be active in oxygen reduction and evolution reactions in an alkaline environment. Combination factors such anatase/rutile interaction, N-doping graphene, and the presence of Ti3+/Ti-N species raise the active sites and improve the electrochemical activity. Our results may afford an opportunity to develop a non-noble and promising electrocatalyst in energy storage technology.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0888-5885			WOS:000755195500021	35645458

It is desirable to develop effective OER electrocatalysts, such as single-atom catalysts (SACs). Here, we demonstrate machine learning (ML)-accelerated prediction of OER overpotential of all transition metals. Based on density functional theory (DFT) calculations of 15 species of SACs, we design a topological information-based ML model to map the OER overpotentials with atomic properties of the corresponding SACs. The trained ML model not only yields remarkable prediction precision (relative error of 6.49%) but also enables a 130,000-fold reduction of prediction time in comparison with pure DFT calculation. Furthermore, an intrinsic descriptor that correlates the overpotential of an SAC with its atomic properties is revealed. The approach and results from this study can be readily applicable to screen other SACs and significantly accelerate the design of high-performance catalysts for many other reactions.									16	0	0	0	0	0	14				2589-0042		WOS:000653990500013	33997683

The data demonstrated that oxygen can be activated and stored on the NPG catalysts at room temperature. Clearly the surface Ag content influenced both the OSC and activity, with a more qualitative correlation for the fresh catalysts and an approximately linear relationship for the stable catalysts after 1000 min on stream. A strictly linear correlation between catalytic activity and OSC, both before and after the reaction, indicated that the active oxygen detected by the TAP reactor measurements also represents the active oxygen species for the reaction at atmospheric pressure. Consequences for the mechanistic understanding of the CO oxidation reaction on NPG catalysts are discussed.									34	1	0	0	2	0	34			1867-3880	1867-3899		WOS:000299616800016

From fundamental principles, a controllable graphdiyne (GDY) induced growth strategy is established; highly uniform size distribution of oxidized iridium quantum dots is prepared on the surface of graphdiyne (IrO(x)QD/GDY). The result shows that, the catalyst exhibits excellent activity and durability for acidic OER, with a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at a small overpotential of 236 mV versus the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) and a Tafel slope of 70 mV dec(-1). The performance is greatly superior to previously reported electrocatalysts. Remarkably, the acidic electrolyzer using IrO(x)QD/GDY as both cathode and anode electrodes can reach 10 mA cm(-2) only at a much low cell voltage of 1.49 V (vs RHE). The results show the superior advantages of graphdiyne in effectively increasing numbers of the catalytically active sites for improving the charge transfer behavior and protecting the metal catalysts from corrosion.									25	4	0	0	0	0	26			1614-6832	1614-6840		WOS:000663378300001

The particles were analyzed in a comparison with photosystem II particles prepared with beta-octylglucoside (OG). The two preparations had similar polypeptide compositions, which were caracterized by high levels of polypeptides from phycobilisomes. The ratio of chlorophyll a to Q(A) was 45 and there were four Mn atoms and one tightly bound Ca2+ ion per Q(A) in the particles prepared with SML. The preparations were thermophilic, showing substantial rates of oxygen evolution at temperatures up to 60-degrees-C. The maximum rates attained at 45-degrees-C were as high as 6.0 mmoles O2 mg-1 Chl h-1. PS II particles prepared with OG were similarly thermostable but were less active in oxygen evolution at all temperatures examined. Kinetic analysis of flash-induced absorption transients revealed that about 22% and 28% of photosystem II reaction centers were not associated with the functional Q(B) site in the SML- and OG-particles, respectively. When corrected for the inactive reaction centers, the maximum rates of oxygen evolution by SML- and OG-particles were 7.7 and 7.0 mmoles O2 mg-1 Chl h-1, which correspond to half times of 1.9 and 2.1 ms for the first-order electron transfer, respectively. Comparison of these half times with those of the S-state transition and the release of oxygen indicates that the overall photosystem II electron transport is limited by the reduction of added electron acceptors and not by release of oxygen.									14	0	0	0	12	0	14			0032-0781			WOS:A1992HR53800013

Here we try to exploit the origin of its high reactivity by fabricating a series of Cu incorporated TiO2 films with the same Cu content under different atmosphere. Based on the comprehensive structure and surface characterizations, it is found that CuO is unstable and will be reduced to Cu2O or even to metallic Cu under light irradiation during the photocatalytic reaction, and Cu2O is an efficient co-catalyst that promotes the separation of photogenerated carriers while metallic Cu can further boost the photocatalytic activity. Besides, it is also noticed that the chemisorbed oxygen on the particle surface blocks the water splitting. By depositing TiO2 films under oxygen rich condition, oxygen vacancy is decreased greatly, which facilitates the removal of chemisorbed oxygen and the formation of metallic Cu during photocatalytic reaction, resulting in an ultra-high H-2 evolution rate of 2.80 pinol cm(-2) h(-1), which is about 55 times higher than that of pure TiO2.

Herein, we introduce the morphology engineering of Ir/Ti electrodes with different acid treatments of hydrochloric acid (HCl) and oxalic acid (OA), and the comparative benefits of these two acid treatment methods are studied from the aspects of their impacts on the morphology, interfacial contact resistance (ICR), and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) performances of resultant electrodes. Notably, compared to the flat surface from OA treatment, Ti substrates with the pillar structure could be successfully achieved via HCl etching. The HCl and the oxalic acid (OA) treatments would reduce the interfacial contact resistance (ICR) to 15.2% and 5.5% of the pristine Ti substrate at 1.38 MPa, respectively. By iridium electrodeposition on Ti substrates, Ir/Ti electrodes with different catalyst loadings are fabricated. With similar low-loadings of about 0.05 mg(Ir) cm(-2), an Ir/Ti electrode with HCl treated substrate exhibits a lower overpotential of similar to 283 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) current density than 305 mV from OA treatment, due to the boosted reaction areas from HCl treatment.

In contrast to the previously developed Cl-2 photochlorination method via Cl radicals, present work found that the photodecomposition of metal chlorides under UV light irradiation was able to chlorinate graphene taking into account both appropriate Cl contents and high carrier mobility. Field effect transistor proved that the mobility was around 345.5 cm(2) V-1 s(-1) when introducing 4.3 atom % Cl dopants. Raman proved that UV irradiation resulted in structural defects to favor the mass transport in electrochemical reactions. Chlorinated vertically oriented graphene nanosheets on carbon cloth exhibited improved oxygen evolution reaction performance in comparison to that of pristine graphene. The specific electrochemical active area and charge transfer analysis indicated that Cl doping was favorable for the exposure of active sites and fast electron transport, thus driving the electrochemical kinetics by virtue of a small Tafel value (59 mV dec(-1)). The direct growth of graphene nanosheets on carbon cloth endowed the freestanding film with robust durability. The present work opens a new avenue for the chlorinated graphene considering all merits for electrochemical activities and will provide promising candidates for application in energy storage and conversion fields.									5	1	0	0	0	0	6			2168-0485			WOS:000472240900093

The catalysts are physicochemically characterized using several techniques including X-ray diffraction, energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, transmission electron microscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and X-ray absorption spectroscopy. Voltammetric profiles obtained for the catalysts calcined up to 300 degrees C are similar to that of electrochemically prepared hydrous iridium oxide, while the CV profiles are characteristic of thermally prepared iridium oxide after calcination at higher temperatures. Performance as an OER catalyst decreases with increasing IrOx calcination temperature, while the opposite trend in stability is observed for these materials. Catalysts calcined between 400 and 500 degrees C exhibit better balances between activity and stability. However, despite higher performance losses, the non-calcined IrOx material still exhibits higher mass activity at the end of the aging experiments at electrode potentials up to 1.6 V vs. RHE. The causes of electrode activity degradation are investigated using identical location transmission electron microscopy, which reveal that III). electrode instability is due to the degradation of the thin IrOx layer, in addition to iridium oxide dissolution.

This means that, while the production of CO2 is avoided by converting to a hydrogen economy, a large amount of CO2 must be produced to drive this transition (as much as 600 kg of CO2 per kilogram of catalyst for CVD-based materials). Here, we demonstrate, for the first time, a sustainable method for synthesizing a bifunctional oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) catalyst directly from CO2 in a process that captures carbon dioxide from the atmosphere or flue gases instead of producing it as all previous methods for creating ORR/HER catalysts.

Here, heterostructural Co 3 O 4 @Ni 2 P arrays with numerous reaction sites, unique interfacial electronic structure and fast charge transfer kinetics are developed as electrocatalysts for rechargeable Zn-air batteries and overall water splitting. Both density functional theory calculation and X-ray absorption fine structure analysis manifest that the synergistic structural and abundant electronic modulations interfaces are formed, thus simultaneously promoting the electrocatalytic kinetics, activities and stabilities. Specifically, it can achieve an ultralow overpotential of 270 mV and 28 mV at 10 mA cm -2 for OER and HER, respectively. The water electrolyzer delivers a current density of 10 mA cm -2 at 1.563 V; furthermore, rechargeable Zn-air batteries triggered by this heterostructure can achieve excellent cyclic stability of 177 h (2 h per cycle) at 10 mA cm -2 ; both devices are superior to the Pt/C + Ir/C. This work not only designs an efficient trifunctional electrocatalyst but also paves an avenue to understand the heterostructure engineering for catalysts development and disclose the underlying relationship of interfacial electronic structures and catalytic properties.

It is found that all of these parameters can affect the OER activity; however, none of them alone play a crucial role in determining the electrocatalytic activity. The correlation of one single physicochemical property with the OER activity always presents deviation points, indicating that a limitation does exist for such 2-dimensional correlations. Nevertheless, these deviations can be explained considering other physicochemical properties and their correlation with the OER activity. Hence, this work aims in simultaneously linking the OER activity with several physicochemical materials properties. The concept of the OER/multidescriptor relationship represents a significant advancement in the search and design of highly active oxygen evolution catalysts, in the quest for efficient anodes in water electrolyzers.									68	2	0	0	4	0	67			2155-5435			WOS:000447224100066

Herein, we present a facile and effective synthetic route for in situ grown 3D hierarchical Ni3S2 superstructures (rod-like arrays and nanoforest patterns) on nickel foam. This handy strategy endows the Ni3S2 superstructures with large surface active areas, porosity, and macro-/mesoporous structures. We have shown that these materials can serve as highly active, binder-free, bifunctional electrocatalysts for both the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Moreover, these materials were found to provide a similar to 100% faradaic yield towards both HER and OER and exhibit remarkable catalytic stability (for > 50 h).									62	6	0	0	4	0	63			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000428847300028

However, meeting the industrial requirement for high efficiency and low cost is difficult to achieve with the existing methods. Herein, a novel and simple synthesis route for a dendritic self-supported electrode consisting of oxygen vacancy-rich NiO embedded within ultrathin 2D/3D nanostructures (NiO-Vo@2D/3D NS@DSE) for overall water splitting is developed for the first time. Based on the simple compound synthesis by jet electrodeposition and in situ acid etching, 2D nanosheets adhering uniformly to 3D nanospheres are successfully obtained on the dendritic self-supported skeleton surface. The experiments and density functional calculations illustrate that this electrode integrates the advantages including numerous active sites, intrinsic catalytic activity, good electrical conductivity, and outstanding reaction kinetic performance. Moreover, NiO-Vo@2D/3D NS@DSE shows excellent oxygen evolution reaction and hydrogen evolution reaction activities in 1 M KOH with overpotentials of 230 and 51 mV at 10 mA cm(-2), respectively. Additionally, the electrode, as an alkali-electrolyzer, displays a potential of 1.51 V at 10 mA cm(-2) with favorable stability that is superior to that of IrO2@nickel foam (NF)//Pt/C@NF (1.62 V). Surprisingly, the cost of NiO-Vo@2D/3D NS@DSE is approximate to 1/120 of the price of noble electrocatalysts with the same mass. This research opens up a new pathway for the design of bifunctional electrocatalysts.									14	2	0	0	1	0	14			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000506887500007	31763653

It was established that the modification of MoS2 with platinum leads to an increase in electron density in the conduction band and an increase in electrical conductivity as compared to the characteristics of unmodified MoS2. The introduction of a mesoporous carbon material (carbon nanotubes, CNTs) provides a surface available for lithium peroxide accumulation. In this case, the Pt/MoS2/CNT system exhibits bifunctional catalytic properties, reducing the charge voltage and increasing the discharge capacity of a LOB as compared to the MoS2/CNT catalyst. In addition, the Pt/MoS2/CNT composite demonstrates a higher activity and reversibility in the oxygen reduction reaction than Pt/CNT, probably due to an increased corrosion resistance of MoS2. According to the results of cyclic tests, LOBs with the Pt/MoS2/CNT system can withstand at least 120 consecutive cycles versus 80 cycles for the MoS2/CNT catalyst.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			1572-6657	1873-2569		WOS:000701843700007

Herein, a highly efficient bifunctional electrocatalyst composed of rhodium (Rh), cobalt (Co), and iron (Fe) alloy nanoparticles embedded in nitrogen-doped graphene (RhFeCo@NG) is prepared through sequential annealing and the substitution reaction. The as-prepared Rh2.6Fe3Co2.6@NG electrocatalyst achieves an overpotential as low as 25 mV for reaching a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) and an ultralow Tafel slope of 29.8 mV dec(-1) in 1 M KOH solution for HER, which is even superior to the state-of-the-art platinum (Pt) catalyst. With regard to ORR, for the Rh2.6Fe3Co2.6@NG electrocatalyst, a half-wave potential (E-1(/)2) of 0.82 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode and excellent long-term stability are achieved. The experimental results illustrate that alloying the Rh atom with the FeCo nanoalloy is mainly responsible for the excellent HER and ORR performances. This study not only provides a robust and promising electrocatalyst for HER and ORR in alkaline media but also sheds light on the devising of efficient and multifunctional catalysts.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3				2574-0970		WOS:000730348500001

Here, we successfully fabricated three-dimensional (3D) flower-like Ni-MOFs on multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) through a highly efficient and rapid microwave synthetic protocol and studied their applicability in electrocatalytic alcohol oxidation reaction (AOR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Morphological studies using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM) images suggested the formation of marigold-like Ni-MOF decorated on the MWCNTs. Surface coverage of NiMOF@CNT (1.11 x 10(-7) mol g(-1)) was higher than that of the pristine Ni-MOF (9.35 x 10(-8) mol g(-1)) electrocatalyst. The higher electrochemical active surface area (ECSA) of Ni-MOF@CNT (494.3 cm(2)) compared to the pristine Ni-MOF (203.5 cm(2)) electrocatalyst resulted in the availability of large active sites in the Ni-MOF@CNT to catalyze AOR and OER. Ni-MOF@CNT exhibited a higher electrooxidation performance in AOR than the pristine Ni-MOF and its OER activity was far superior.									34	0	0	0	3	0	34			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000623242000003

However, the application of the method is mostly limited to the delamination of materials with weak interlayer interactions such as van der Waals forces. On the other hand, the massive consumption of layered cathode materials, e.g., LiCoO2, in portable electronic devices highlights the urgent necessity of developing effective strategies to recycle the spent electrode materials. In this work, based on a positive bias driven exfoliation strategy, we report for the first time the synergistic action of phase conversion and lattice expansion that leads to the exfoliation of spent LiCoO2 with robust Li-O interplanar bonding into ultra-thin CoOOH nanosheets, which are well adapted for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrocatalysis. This work not only offers a general route to exfoliate layered materials with strong interlayer chemical bonding, but also proposes an effective route to re-utilize the spent electrode materials.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000731722300001

In order to fully understand its initial oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), in this work, oxygen and lithium adsorptions and the initial ORR on stoichiometric and reduced CeO2 surfaces were systematically investigated using density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Changes of free energy values and structural parameters of the intermediates and precursors of the initial ORR were also studied to identify the possible reaction paths. It was found that the oxygen atoms are preferably adsorbed on the reduced CeO2 surface, whereas the lithium atoms are preferably adsorbed on both the stoichiometric and reduced CeO2 surfaces; therefore, there exists a strong adsorption at the site with high oxygen coordination. The reduced CeO2 with the surface oxygen vacancies was identified as the most critical surface for the initial oxygen reduction reaction. The path with the lithium adsorption as the first step was identified as the most probable one. A Li3O2 precursor was identified as the most possible initial structure of the catalyst to start the discharging process.									28	0	0	0	0	0	28			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000395077600030

This nanoparticle architecture optimizes optical features due to the interactions of closely spaced plasmonic branches forming electromagnetic hot spots, and the ultra-thin IrO2 layer maximizes efficient use of this expensive catalyst. This concept was evaluated towards the enhancement of the electrocatalytic performances towards the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) as a model transformation. The OER can play a central role in meeting future energy demands but the performance of conventional electrocatalysts in this reaction is limited by the sluggish OER kinetics. We demonstrate an improvement of the OER performance for one of the most active OER catalysts, IrO2, by harvesting plasmonic effects from visible light illumination in multimetallic nanoparticles. We find that the OER activity for the Au-IrO2 nanoflowers can be improved under LSPR excitation, matching best properties reported in the literature. Our simulations and electrocatalytic data demonstrate that the enhancement in OER activities can be attributed to an electronic interaction between Au and IrO2 and to the activation of Ir-O bonds by LSPR excited hot holes, leading to a change in the reaction mechanism (rate-determinant step) under visible light illumination.									14	0	0	0	2	0	14			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000544063600043	32319490

In spite of being one of the largest class of materials, very few metal oxides have shown the propensity for HER in acidic medium. Herein, we report V10O24 center dot nH(2)O nanofibers as an excellent electrocatalyst material for HER for the first time. We show that V10O24 center dot nH(2)O nanostructures with a mixed V5+/V4+ oxidation state and a jute-fiber like morphology having a layered disposition and large interlayer spacing of 1.3 nm characterized by interlayer water molecules, can act as an excellent HER electrocatalyst in acidic medium. It required a low overpotential of 118 mV reaching to -10 mA cm(-2) current density and at 600 mV overpotential reached a current density of -405 mA cm(-2). It showed excellent durability retaining ca. 90% of its initial activity even after cycling for more than 11 h. Mechanism of the HER electrocatalysis was investigated by Tafel analysis that revealed typical Volmer-Heyrovsky mechanism for the HER with an excellent exchange current density of 1.62 mA cm(-2). The vanadium oxide catalyst was also explored as oxygen reduction reaction electrocatalyst for application in alkaline fuel-cells. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Urea-assisted energy-saving alkaline hydrogen production has been promising alternative pathway. Herein, we demonstrate an ion-exchange strategy to fabricate cobalt phosphide nanowire decorated with nickel phosphide nanosheets core@shell heterostructured arrays with sulfur doping at the interface (S-Co2P@Ni2P) for both hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and urea oxidation reaction (UOR). Interfacial S-doping induces charge transfer from S-Co2P to Ni2P in the heterostructure, generating electron-rich Ni centers and electron-deficient Co centers to be active sites for HER and UOR, respectively, with optimized absorption/desorption energies of reactants/products to accelerate the catalytic kinetics of HER and UOR. As a result, S-Co2P@Ni2P requires an overpotential of 103 mV and potential of 1.36 V (vs. RHE) to achieve 100 mA cm(-2) for HER and UOR, respectively, and drives the full urea electrolysis at 1.43 V to deliver current density of 10 mA cm(-2).									13	0	0	0	1	0	13			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000783208100003

Here we report Co9S8 nanoparticles grown in situ on nitrogen-and sulfur-doped porous carbon (Co9S8/NSPC) as a bifunctional catalyst for OER and ORR using poly(2-aminothiazole) as a novel all-in-one multifunctional precursor. Unexpectedly, Co9S8/NSPC exhibits a low OER overpotential, positive ORR half-wave potential, small potential gap and high durability, thus making it one of the best bifunctional OER and ORR catalysts. This may be attributed to the heteroatom doping, porous structure and synergistic effects of Co9S8 and NSPC, as confirmed by density functional theory calculations. More importantly, as a proof-of-concept application, the air electrode with Co9S8/NSPC9-45 endows the Zn-air battery with a low discharge/charge overpotential and good cycling stability.									148	12	0	0	5	0	150			1884-4049	1884-4057		WOS:000383415300007		
J	Tan, Guoying; Zhao, Xiuping; Zhang, Zhuang; Yang, Xue; Chen, Jing; Xu, Ling; Li, Yaping; Kuang, Yun								First-principles study of the oxygen evolution reaction on Ni3Fe-layered double hydroxides surfaces with varying sulfur coverage								MOLECULAR CATALYSIS				519						112116	10.1016/j.mcat.2022.112116				FEB 2022	2022	Ni3Fe-layered double hydroxides (Ni3Fe-LDHs) are promising catalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Recently, Ni3Fe (oxy) hydroxides incorporating S have demonstrated enhanced OER activity, but the effects of varying the S coverage have not been studied. The present work used first-principles calculations to explore the OER performance of Ni3Fe-LDH specimens with 1/4, 1/2 and 3/4 S monolayer coverage on their (110) surfaces. The performances of the three Ni3Fe-LDH with different S coverages were compared to that with a clean surface at both Ni and Fe sites. The overpotential values calculated for Ni sites decreased in the order of clean > 1/2 monolayer > 3/4 monolayer > 1/4 monolayer, while the values for Fe sites decreased in the order of clean > 3/4 monolayer > 1/2 monolayer > 1/4 monolayer. In addition, the overpotentials at Fe sites were determined to be lower than those at Ni sites for the same coverage. In the case of a 1/4 S monolayer coverage, the overpotential at Fe sites was as low as 153 mV. Comparison of the Bader charge values and partial density of states data between the O covered and S covered surfaces indicated that a surface with a 1/4 S monolayer readily adsorbed the reaction intermediate OH.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2468-8231			WOS:000781072000006

Because of the high cost and scarcity of noble metals, reducing the usage is a practical way to achieve scalable applications. Herein, for the first time, three novel electrocatalysts composed of noble metal phosphide (IrP2, Pd3P, or PtP2) nanoparticles with N,P-codoped nanocarbon were synthesized by the pyrolysis of mixtures of IrCl4, PdCl2, or PtCl4 with phytic acid under an ammonia atmosphere. With an ultralow loading of Pd (1.5 mu g), Pt (1.4 mu g), or Ir (1.6 mu g) on the electrode, the Pd3P/NPC, PtP2/NPC, and IrP2/NPC catalysts, respectively, exhibited excellent trifunctional catalytic oxygen reduction reaction, hydrogen evolution reaction, and oxygen evolution reaction. Notably, the IrP2/NPC-, Pd3P/NPC-, and PtP2/NPC-based water-splitting cells required only 1.62, 1.65, and 1.68 V, respectively, to deliver the current density of 10 mA cm(-2). Furthermore, the IrP2/NPC-, Pd3P/NPC-, and PtP2/NPC-based zinc-air batteries exhibited higher specific capacities than that of Pt/C. IrP2/NPC exhibited a comparable performance to that of Pt/C-IrO2 for use in rechargeable zinc-air batteries.									28	3	0	0	0	0	29			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000467781100022	31002222

In this work, unlike traditional furnace pyrolysis, we report the rapid and single-step room-temperature synthesis of Pt/VC nanocomposites with a three-dimensional (3D) network porous structure by laser irradiation technology. The resultant Pt-based composite (Pt/VC-2.84) could be applied to HER under different pH conditions. In particular, the content of Pt in Pt/VC-2.84 is only 2.84 wt %, which is far lower than that in the advanced HER electrocatalyst with the Pt content of 20 wt % (commercial 20 wt % Pt/C). In addition, Pt/VC-2.84 exhibits a boosted higher OER activity and stability than RuO2 in an alkaline medium. Most importantly, electrocatalytic results reflect that Pt/VC-2.84 reveals superior activity and stability toward overall water splitting.									2	0	0	0	1	0	2			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000820174300001	35537035

Results of 24 h of anodic polarization showed that the presence of these additives depolarized the OER. A reduction of 25 mV of anodic potential was obtained by addition of 5 mg L-1 of [EMIM]ESO4 to that obtained from free-addition electrolyte. Corrosion measurements employing linear polarization technique revealed that corrosion rate of Pb-0.7% Ag was decreased by similar to 25-42% by the addition of [EMIM]ESO4 or [EMIM]Br. Corrosion current was found to be decreased in the order of [EMIM]ESO4 < [EMIM]Br < Gelatin <= Blank < [EMIM]Cl. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy demonstrated that addition of ILS to the zinc sulfate electrolyte increased the charge transfer resistance of the anodic dissolution reaction except for [EMIM]Cl. Zero resistance ammeter and scanning reference electrode techniques showed the same corrosion tendency obtained from other techniques and proved that no localized corrosion was observed in the presence of Cl ions.

Notably, the long-term stability becomes a significant challenge. Herein, we present a novel volume OER (VOER) strategy to solve the problems via pre-intercalation of phosphate. Phosphate-intercalated Ni-Ni(OH)2/NiOOH electrode was prepared by a two-step electrochemical method. The obtained porous electrode exhibits outstanding OER performance in the alkaline phosphate electrolyte with the overpotentials of 129 and 243 mV at 10 and 100 mA cm(-2), respectively, and stability for 1000 h. The exceptional performance is mainly ascribed to effective VOER and elimination of the interlayer-produced protons, because the phosphate -intercalation enhances the interlayer water content, interlayer spacing and proton transport ability, endows the interlayers with proton buffering capacity, and alters the chemical environment of the interlayer Ni-O. The finding provides a strategy to develop highly efficient and stable OER materials and reaction systems for layered transition metal hydroxides. (c) 2022 Elsevier Inc.

Smooth 1D nanowires of NiCo-LDHs were delaminated into thin nanosheets to form three-dimensional dendritic structures. Furthermore, the electrochemical active surface area was significantly increased and more higher oxidation states were exposed during this process.

The synthesized hexagonal cobalt nano-urchins exhibited a high coercivity of 2891.5 Oe. Further, we also studied the influence of the structure and morphology of cobalt nanomaterials on the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity. This combination of highly crystalline hexagonal close-packed nanostructure and special branch morphology can effectively enhance OER performance.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0957-4522	1573-482X		WOS:000658106000009

For instance, transition metal oxide-based catalysts film has an optimum coating thickness due to the charge transport limitation. In this article, we investigated the charge transport behavior at the interface between the catalysts and the underlying substrate, which has been less investigated than the two other charge-transporting interfaces, that is, the catalysts surfaces and the inner catalysts film. We observed that Mn3O4 nanocatalysts exhibited different oxygen-evolving performances depending on the underlying substrate, and this activity trend was correlated with the work function of the substrate. We analyzed the work function dependency based on the energy band structure at the catalysts substrate interface and determined that the substrates with low work functions formed high Schottky barriers, disturbing the interfacial charge transport. On the basis of this understanding, we demonstrated that the catalytic activity of Mn3O4 nanocatalysts film can be significantly enhanced using industrially important Ti substrates that have a thin buffering interlayer with the proper work function.									14	0	0	0	1	0	14			2155-5435			WOS:000508466700027

Here, we report a successful size modulation strategy for FeCo binary alloys in situ growth on the carbon matrix. Analogous to Pt nanoparticles, the size modulation could give rise to increased active sites in FeCo-based catalysts without altering their chemical properties. The compositionally optimized template with abundant carbon nanotubes and uniform distribution of FeCo alloy nanoparticles, exhibits superior electrocatalytic activity by achieving a high-performance half-wave potential of 0.88 V toward ORR as well as robust stability after 10 000 cycles. The open-circuit potential (V-oc) of the liquid Zn-air battery is close to 1.40 V which is comparable with that of the Zn-air battery equipped with Pt/C+IrO2.

The mechanism proposed by Noyes with Furrow and De Kepper with Epstein, adapted for acetone and expanded with oxygen evolution and first-order escape of iodine by interphase transport, was subjected to further extension, and calculations assuming direct proportionality of the rate of iodine escape on the surface area of the oxygen gas trapped in the solution as well as calculations considering first-order back-flow of iodine from the gas phase into the solution were performed. Furthermore, the concentrations of iodine vapors were considered to be variable within the bubble population, as all the bubbles are not in contact with the reaction mixture for the same length of time. Distribution functions of the surface size over the range of concentrations of iodine in the contacting gas phase were introduced and derived, and whereas they were proved not to play any role in the total intensity of iodine return when it is first-order, the article also demonstrates their explicit consideration in calculations to be essential if the dependence of the rate of iodine return into the solution on its concentration is not linear, for example, in future extensions of the model with bubble radius also considered variable.									5	0	0	0	1	0	5			1089-5639			WOS:000280360800009	20666537

Even though a number of materials have been designed for HER, still suffer from little photocatalytic activity which restricts the practical applications. Introducing the vacancies and doping is an effective approach to control the electronic bandstructures of materials which in turn results the improved photocatalytic activity. In this study, we have synthesized one dimensional CdS nanorods by a solvothermal method and then developed a low temperature heating strategy to incorporate the O-doping and Svacancies simultaneously into CdS towards visible photocatalytic H-2 evolution reaction. The heat treated samples with controlled O-doping and S-vacancies offer enhanced visible light absorption and improved photogenerated charge carriers' separation. Moreover, the S-vacancies also acted as traps to retard the electron-hole recombination rate. As a result, CdS sample treated at 200 degrees C for 2 hr showed a high photocatalytic H-2 evolution activity of 377 mu mol/g/h which is 22 times higher than 18 mu mol/g/h for pure CdS sample. This work validates a simple thermal treatment method to produce S-vacancies and O-doping for the fabrication of efficient photocatalysts for solar hydrogen production. (c) 2021 Elsevier B.V.

Their exceptional layered structure, sole electronic structure, and high specific surface area, makes them to show good OER catalytic performance. The catalytic performances of LDHs are largely governed by their composition, morphology, and intercalated anions, which can be produced via exfoliation processes and different synthetic methods. Although LDH materials have enormous advantages in energy-related applications, there are still some inherent drawbacks in the OER process that need to be overcome for long-term usage. These drawbacks in the internal properties of LDHs are attributed to their low electrical conductivity and structural collapse, particularly during the exfoliation process, making the OER kinetics unpredictable. To overcome these drawbacks, researchers have developed many strategies recently, and these are (i) nano-structuring; (ii) the addition of cations; (iii) anion exchange; (iv) the synthesis of materials with conductive supports; and (v) vacancy creation. Hence, this review ultimately focuses on how to overcome the extensive issues faced by LDHs in terms of synthetic and exfoliation methods and discusses various strategies developed in recent years in the field of the electrocatalytic water-based oxygen evolution reaction.									88	1	0	0	2	0	89			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000612470000003

Nevertheless, up to now, the PEC conversion efficiency of the established photoanode is still low. In this work, alpha-Fe2O3/NiFe layered double hydroxide (LDH) photoanodes were synthesized by electrodeposition of LDH on alpha-Fe2O3. Compared with bare alpha-Fe2O3, the alpha-Fe2O3/Ni0.5Fe0.5-LDH photoanode displays about 3 times photocurrent enhancement and excellent long-term stability. The enhanced PEC activity of alpha-Fe2O3/NiFe-LDH is ascribed to the interface between alpha-Fe2O3 and NiFe-LDH which can facilitate charge transfer and improve carrier density. Simultaneously, NiFe-LDH as a co-catalyst can accelerate the surface OER kinetics. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.									29	2	0	0	1	0	29			0925-8388	1873-4669		WOS:000444058300041

Herein, we report a novel strategy to expedite the HER kinetics of NiFe LDH by an Ir4+-doping strategy to accelerate the water dissociation process (Volmer step), and thus this catalyst exhibits superior and robust catalytic activity for finally oriented overall water splitting in 1 M KOH requiring only a low initial voltage of 1.41 V delivering at 20 mA cm(-2) for more than 50 h.									86	8	0	0	2	0	88			1359-7345	1364-548X		WOS:000435350000040	29872782

Here, we report the colloidal synthesis of Fe doped NiSe2, which functions as a high-performance electrocatalyst for the OER in alkaline solution. The NiFeSe catalysts are composed of urchin-like dendrites with a high number of active sites, which could provide fast transportation of electrons and electrolytes, and facile release of the evolved O-2 bubbles during the OER catalysis. Benefitting from this unique urchin-like structure and strong electron interaction between Fe, Ni, and Se, the Ni1.12Fe0.49Se2 catalyst exhibits excellent electrocatalytic activity and high durability toward the OER in alkaline solution, with an overpotential of 227 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2), which is, to the best of our knowledge, higher than most of the reported selenide-based electrocatalysts.									103	8	0	0	0	0	105			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000402034400026	28497144

In electrochemical water splitting, NiFe/RGO shows superior OER performance compared to bare NiFe and reference IrO2 with a lower benchmark rho value (required overpotential to drive 10 mA cm(-2)) of 0.245 V. Furthermore, NiFe/RGO substantially increases the performance of a hematite photoanode in photoelectrochemical water oxidation, demonstrating its potential as an OER co-catalyst for photoelectrodes.

Herein, a one-step route to in situ grow S-doped FeOOH vertical nanosheets on iron foam (IF) in 20 min under room temperature is shown. This facile and ultrafast method effectively modifies the surface of the IF into an S-doped FeOOH layer, and a full-Fe electrode (S-FeOOH/IF) is achieved. Systematic experiments and characterizations demonstrate that the redox reactivities for both of the iron and lattice oxygen in FeOOH are sufficiently activated, leading to the dramatically improved intrinsic OER activity. The as-obtained S-FeOOH/IF exhibits a fascinating OER performance with a low overpotential of 244 at 10 mA cm(-2). This work affords an efficient surface engineering strategy to drive commercial IF into cost-efficient and robust earth-abundant electrocatalysts for water oxidation, which has important implications for clean H-2 production through a low-carbon and environmentally friendly route.									10	0	0	0	0	0	10			1616-301X	1616-3028		WOS:000772223100001

However, the energy efficiency and cycling stability are still the challenges for the practical application of lithium-oxygen battery. Herein, the 1,4 para benzoquinone has been demonstrated as dual-function redox mediator for promoting both oxygen reduction and oxygen evolution reactions of lithium-oxygen battery with polymer electrolyte, which have been confirmed by the Cyclic Voltammetry and discharge/charge test of battery under O-2 gas, as well as the theoretical calculations. Furthermore, the composite cathode that in-situ constructed by polymerizing electrolyte precursors with redox mediator can be beneficial for the electrochemical reactions. Combing composite cathode and lithium ions source, the polymer electrolyte based lithium-oxygen batteries can operate for long lifetime with low charge potentials and good rate performances. Thus, this work has highlighted the promising implementation of lithium-oxygen battery based on polymer electrolyte, in which the dual-function redox mediator are employed for both discharge and recharge processes.

Herein, we proposed a facile route to synthesize and load the composite of amorphous CoFe oxyhydroxide (CoFeOx(-OH)y) and MoS2 on the carbon paper by combining a hydrothermal and an electrodeposition process. CoFeOx(OH)y has a special feature of long-range disorder (amorphous phase) and short-range order (crystal phase), which greatly improves the OER catalytic performance of the hybrids. In virtue of the synergistic effect of CoFeOx(OH)y and MoS2, an improved electronic coupling effect occurs, which increases the oxidation state of Co and Fe, and thus enhances OER activity. Assynthesized CoFeOx(OH)y/MoS2/CP (CFOMS/CP) electrode affords excellent electrocatalytic activity and good electrochemical OER stability: A small Tafel slope of 37.9 mV dec(-1)(vs. 62.1 mV dec(-1) for CoFeOx(OH)(y)/CP, 120.2 mV dec(-1) for RuO2/CP) and low overpotential 242 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) (vs. 263 mV for CoFeOx(OH)(y)/CP, 317 mV for RuO2/CP), as well as a stable running for 25 h.

Transition metal carbide (TMC)-based catalysts have been reported to feature high activity and outstanding stability in both the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Here, density functional theory computations are carried out to investigate the potential performance of transition metal-doped VC(001) systems on the HER, OER, and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). The results reveal that the introduction of transition metals not only greatly enhances the weak binding between hydrogen and the surface, but also modulates the interaction strength of the OER/ORR adsorption intermediates. More importantly, Ir-doped VC(001) presents promising trifunctional electrocatalytic activity with low overpotentials of 0.10, 0.56, and 0.52 V for the HER, OER, and ORR, respectively. The Pt-doped VC(001) is expected to be a promising bifunctional electrocatalyst for overall water splitting (0.16 V for the HER, 0.58 V for the OER). The Fermi-abundance model is used to better understand the origin of the HER, OER, and ORR activities of the TM-doped VC(001) structures. In this study, we developed a Fermi-abundance model that provides new possibilities for the rational design of multifunctional electrocatalysts for renewable energy conversion and storage as well as the application of TMCs.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			1932-7447	1932-7455		WOS:000674871100013

However, as a four-electron coupled reaction, the OER is kinetically sluggish and limited by its high overpotential and low efficiency. The design of novel nanostructured electrocatalysts is highly desirable to promote OER kinetics. Herein, a bio-inspired nanoleaf electrocatalyst has been successfully achieved for the first time by in situ growing ultrathin NiCo layered double hydroxide (LDH) nanosheets on CuO nanowires. Attributed to the mechanical support of CuO nanowire veins, the NiCo LDH lamina presents a large lateral size (more than 10 mu m) and unique hierarchical structure that consisted of ultrathin nanosheets with numerous exposed edges. The CuO veins distributed across the LDH lamina can serve as the fast path for charge transfer and significantly promote the LDH conductivity. Compared to the conventional NiCo LDH nanosheets, the novel nanoleaves with enlarged electrochemical surface area, edge-rich active sites, and improved conductivity exhibit greatly enhanced OER performances with an impressive 9.3 fold enhanced activity, much lower overpotential of 262 mV at 10 mA cm(-2), as well as good stability and flexibility. The biomimetic nanoleaf structures and the corresponding design strategy can be broadly applied to other functional 2D materials for advanced applications.									36	2	0	0	3	0	37			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000488308800003

This work presents the enhanced electrochemical hydrogen generation process from urea sewage by coupling the urea oxidation reaction (UOR) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) under the catalysis of nanoporous nickel-iron (NP-NiFe)-based catalysts. The porous structure at the nanoscale facilitates electrocatalysis through exposure and access more active sites as well as improving the mass transfer. The optimized NP-NiFe (NP-Ni0.7Fe0.3) displays excellent oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity. The overpotential can be further lowered to similar to 60 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) in urea sewage (0.33 M urea and 1 M KOH) because of coupling with the UOR, and therefore, the full water splitting potential is much lower in urea sewage (1.55 vs 1.68 V) at 10 mA cm(-2). The relationship between the UOR and OER at different potentials during electrolysis of urea was further investigated by mass spectrometry. The spontaneous desorption of CO2 (UOR product) from the surface of NP-NiFe indicates that NP-NiFe has more effective UOR activity. In addition, NP-NiFe has also been proven to be used in the full electrolysis of urea-containing wastewater for hydrogen production.					24th Annual Green Chemistry and Engineering (GC&E) Conference24th Annual Green Chemistry and Engineering (GC&E) Conference	JUN 15-19, 2020JUN 15-19, 2020		ACS Green Chem Inst, ELECTR NETWORKACS Green Chem Inst, ELECTR NETWORK	31	0	0	0	1	0	31			2168-0485			WOS:000557382400042

Numerous studies have focused on the development of highly efficient electrocatalysts to produce hydrogen and oxygen from water electrolysis through the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER), respectively. Up to now, the most effective electrocatalysts for electrochemical water splitting are still materials based on Pt, Ru and Ir. Although these materials exhibit very good performance, their massive utilization is limited due to the scarce resources. Therefore, the search for suitable, efficient, inexpensive, stable and abundant materials for electrochemical water splitting is imperative for the large-scale, worldwide, commercial implementation of electrolytic hydrogen generation. Abundant first-row transition metal-based electrocatalysts for water splitting are considered as promising alternatives to those based on noble metals. It has been found that materials combining two metals exhibit enhanced electrocatalytic activity. It is the focus of this review to show that efficient first-row bimetallic materials can be obtained from the corresponding metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) as precursors. The present review describes recent advances in bimetallic electrocatalysts derived from bimetallic MOFs containing first row transition metals, including bimetallic oxides, bimetallic chalcogenides, bimetallic nitrides and their composites. Challenges in this area and future research directions are highlighted.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1754-5692	1754-5706		WOS:000818053800001

The effect of the incorporation of copper on the resulting morphology, structure, and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity of the spinel Co oxides was investigated. In general, Cu-doped samples exhibited improved OER activity associated to the reduction of electrical resistivity of the spinel due to the presence of Cu2+ into the lattice. Further, the ionic bonding of OH- with Cu2+ is weaker relative to the Co3+ ions at the octahedral sites, which could have facilitated OER better. Among the Cu concentration experimented, Cu0.5Co2.5O4 exhibited the best OER catalytic with an onset overpotential and Tafel slope of about 271 mV and 100.4 mV.dec-1, respectively. This is attributed to its better conductivity due to the absence of a resistive secondary CuO phase.					5th International Conference on Chemical Materials and Process5th International Conference on Chemical Materials and Process	1-3 May 20191-3 May 2019		Bangkok, ThailandBangkok, Thailand	4	0	0	0	1	0	4			1757-8981			INSPEC:19090701

The chemical analysis of the solid phase showed that the CBNF was gradually oxidized during repeated water splitting, but the evolved H-2 amount is 1.5-2 times larger than that expected from the oxidation of the CBNF. Following two types of hydrogen evolution reactions are considered to be participated: Type I is the water splitting by the activated form of CIO layer(alpha(n)), where the activated form changes to the original form (beta(n)), Type II is hydrogen evolution by the oxidation of CIO layer, where the original CIO layer form(beta(n)) changes to an oxidized form (beta(n+1)) The amount of released oxygen was about 40-80% of the amount estimated from the amount of hydrogen gas evolved by the Type I reaction. Thus, the stoichiometry of the above two steps has been demonstrated.					7th International Conference on Ferrites (ICF 7)7th International Conference on Ferrites (ICF 7)	SEP 03-06, 1996SEP 03-06, 1996		BORDEAUX, FRANCEBORDEAUX, FRANCE	1	0	0	0	0	0	1			1155-4339			WOS:A1997XE52900282

A very effective approach to dramatically decrease the input cell voltage of water electrolysis is to replace the anodic OER with hydrazine oxidation reaction (HzOR) due to its lower thermodynamic oxidation potential. Therefore, developing the low-cost and efficient HzOR catalysts, coupled with the cathodic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), is tremendously important for energy-saving electrolytic hydrogen production. Herein, a new-type of copper-nickel nitride (Cu1Ni2-N) with rich Cu4N/Ni3N interface is rationally constructed on carbon fiber cloth. The 3D electrode exhibits extraordinary HER performance with an overpotential of 71.4 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) in 1.0 m KOH, simultaneously delivering an ultralow potential of 0.5 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) for HzOR in a 1.0 m KOH/0.5 m hydrazine electrolyte.

The rational design of oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) bifunctional electrocatalysts with superior activity and stability in the same electrolyte is the key to promoting their large-scale applications. Herein, an ultralow Ru (1.08 wt%) transition metal phosphide on nickel foam (Ru-MnFeP/NF) derived from Prussian blue analogue, that effectively drivies both the OER and the HER in 1 m KOH, is reported. To reach 20 mA cm(-2) for OER and 10 mA cm(-2) for HER, the Ru-MnFeP/NF electrode only requires overpotentials of 191 and 35 mV, respectively. Such high electrocatalytic activity exceeds most transition metal phosphides for the OER and the HER, and even reaches Pt-like HER electrocatalytic levels. Accordingly, it significantly accelerates full water splitting at 10 mA cm(-2) with 1.470 V, which outperforms that of the integrated RuO2 and Pt/C couple electrode (1.560 V). In addition, the extremely long operational stability (50 h) and the successful demonstration of a solar-to-hydrogen generation system through full water splitting provide more flexibility for large-scale applications of Ru-MnFeP/NF catalysts.									104	5	0	0	7	0	105			1614-6832	1614-6840		WOS:000537884600001

In this work, we for the first time report a high-efficiency electrocatalyst cobalt telluride encapsulated in nitrogen-doped carbon nanotube frameworks (CoTe2@NCNTFs) derived from metal-organic framework ZIF-67, which was synthesized via a straightforward telluride process under a hydrogen atmosphere. Notably, benefiting from the hollow polyhedron carbon nanostructure with large surface area, high conductivity, fast electron transport, and open channels for effective gas release, the as-synthesized electrocatalysts exhibit remarkable catalytic activity, with overpotentials of 330 mV and 208 mV toward the OER and HER at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) in 1.0 M KOH solution, respectively. Moreover, when CoTe2@NCNTFs was fabricated as an alkaline electrolyzer in basic solution, overall water splitting was achieved with high efficiency, which was comparable to the integrated performance of the commercial IrO2 and Pt/C catalyst couple. Our work provides a way for developing efficient noble-metal-free catalysts via rational surface engineering.									108	5	0	0	2	0	109			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000425623600043

Although the intrinsic HER activity of CoP is lower than Pt/C, CoP can replace Pt as the cathode of PEC water splitting cells without any significant loss in performance. During the water splitting reaction, the cathode remains as CoP, but CoP loaded on the BiVO4 photoanode turns into amorphous CoOx-HPOy with its chemical state and performance very similar to those of well-known cobalt phosphate electrocatalysts. A tandem cell composed of CoP/hydrogen-treated, 1% Mo-doped BiVO4 as the photoanode, a CoP/Ni foam as the cathode and a 2-piece, series connected crystalline Si solar cell as the bias power generator demonstrates stable unassisted water splitting with a solar-to-hydrogen conversion efficiency of 5.3% under simulated solar light, which represents the highest among reported precious metal-free unassisted solar water splitting devices.									37	1	0	0	2	0	37			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000422949700058

Damjanovic oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) mechanisms with either oxygen electrochemisorption or oxygen chemisorption are comparatively studied in the simulation through THD spectroscopy and commonly used methods that include steady state current voltage (I-V) curve and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). Comparison results show that only THD spectroscopy is able to make a fine distinction for the ORR mechanisms in certain kinetically controlled frequency ranges. The Damjanovic ORR mechanism with oxygen chemisorption is recognized as a better option for the ORR process in the PEMFC due to the reproducible experimental THD spectra. The observed nonlinear response in the frequency range from 2.5 Hz to 15.8 Hz is also recognized as the fingerprint of the ORR process. Crown Copyright (C) 2013 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Despite their good electric conductivity and high catalytic activities, these carbon-containing catalysts suffer from electrochemical carbon corrosion which limits their utility in metal-air batteries and fuel cells. Here, we report a class of perovskite La0.5Sr0.5Mn1-xNixO3-delta nanocrystals that are intrinsically conductive with good electrocatalytic activity for the ORR Among these perovskites, La0.5Sr0.5Mn1-xNixO3-delta (delta = 0.06, LSMN) exhibited the highest electrocatalytic activity for ORR with an onset potential of 1.02 V, a half-wave potential of 0.80-V, and a Tafel slope of -68 mV decade(-1) in 0.1 M potassium hydroxide aqueous solution. Negligible degradation of oxygen reduction currents was observed after 300 cyclic voltammetry scans from 1.08 to 0.15 V. We demonstrated that the electrically conductive perovskites with transition-metal redox couples and oxygen vacancies are essential. Our work demonstrates the possibility of carbon-free oxygen electrocatalysis with widely promising applications.									44	4	0	0	1	0	45			2155-5435			WOS:000387306100068

Herein, by the fine-tuning thermal-reduction treatment of cobalt phosphonates with spherical shape, the novel carbon-wrapped CoP-Co2P polymorphs are rationally constructed. The unique hierarchical porous architecture and heterointerface of CoP-Co2P not only increase active sites but also ensure intrinsic activity. The resultant catalyst exhibits significantly boosted HER activity in a wide pH range, for instance, a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at the overpotential of 81 mV in 0.5 mol L-1 H2SO4, 109 mV in 1.0 mol L-1 KOH, and 227 mV in 1.0 mol L-1 phosphate buffer saline, and remarkable OER activity (1.53 V@10 mA cm(-2) in 1.0 mol L-1 KOH), associated with the impressive stability for each reaction. Moreover, serving as the bifunctional electrocatalysts in a two-electrode electrolyzer for overall water splitting, a low cell voltage of 1.60 V can deliver a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) in 1.0 mol L-1 KOH. The structural evolution process of the CoP-Co2P catalyst during electrolysis is thoroughly investigated. This work presents a new approach for designing and fabricating efficient and affordable metal phosphides for various electrochemical technologies.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2095-8226	2199-4501		WOS:000793687400002

Herein, we for the first time present a facile one-pot hydrothermal approach for in situ growth of vertically aligned and interconnected Co0.85Se nanoflakes on cobalt foam (denoted as Co0.85Se@Co foam). The as-prepared Co0.85Se@Co foam demonstrates excellent electrocatalytic activity for hydrogen evolution reaction in alkaline electrolyte, demanding a low overpotential of 100 mV to achieve the current density of 10 mA cm(-2), a Tafel slope of 165 mV dec(-1), and good durability. It also displays good catalytic performance toward oxygen evolution reaction with an overpotential of 360 mV at the current density of 50 mA cm(-2), and a Tafel slope of 81.6 mV dec(-1). The good electrocatalytic performance of Co0.85Se@Co foam is largely attributed to the direct growth of active Co0.85Se nanoflakes on Co foam with sufficient active sites, the seamless integration of Co0.85Se nanoflakes and three-dimensionally porous Co foam substrate for efficient electrons and ions transport.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			0957-4522	1573-482X		WOS:000530269300010

Recently, developing precise and universal strategies to synthesize MNMCs have achieved remarkable progress in electrocatalysis, yet lacking a comprehensive study on universal synthetic strategies to noble metal-based nanomaterials in different dimensions. In this review, we systematically summarized the latest research advances on universal strategies to MNMCs for electrocatalysis applications by structure optimizations. Generally, we concluded the classifications of various universal strategies on preparing MNMCs, involving universal hydro/solvothermal strategy, ligand-mediated method, template-assisted route, epitaxial growth, and CO-confinement strategy. Then we analyzed the structure optimizations on MNMCs for enhanced properties benefited from the use of universal strategies, including the increasement of active sites, construction of high-index facets, optimization of electronic interaction, and regulation of phase structure. The electrocatalysis application in direct alcohol fuel cells (anodic alcohol oxidation (AOR) and cathodic oxygen reduction reaction (ORR)), water electrolysis (hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER)) have also been explored by illustrating specific examples. We finally outlined the opportunities and challenges for the further developments of universal strategies to MNMCs. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V.

In view of the reaction overpotential at electrode/electrolyte interface, the OER electrocatalysts have been extensively used as cocatalysts for PEC water oxidation on photoanode. In this work, the feasibility of a one-step fabrication of the transparent thin film catalyst for efficient electrochemical OER is investigated. The Ni-Fe bimetal oxide films, similar to 200 nm in thickness, are used for study. Using a reactive magnetron co-sputtering technique, transparent (> 50% in wavelength range 500-2000 nm) Ni-Fe oxide films with high electrocatalytic activities were successfully prepared at room temperature. Upon optimization, the as-prepared bimetal oxide film with atomic ratio of Fe/Ni = 3: 7 demonstrates the lowest overpotential for the OER in aqueous KOH solution, as low as 329 mV at current density of 2 mA cm(-2), which is 135 and 108 mV lower than that of as-sputtered FeOx and NiOx thin films, respectively. It appears that this fabrication strategy is very promising to deposit optically transparent cocatalyst films on photoabsorbers for efficient PEC water splitting. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

In this study, a highly porous dual metal-organic framework (MOF) based bimetallic cobalt-iron phosphide and oxide nanoarrays were developed on nickel foam by a two-step liquid phase deposition process followed by calcination and phosphatization. As-synthesized MOF bimetallic derivatives act as effective bifunctional catalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). It is interesting to note that the optimized electrochemical efficiency for OER and HER was achieved by MOF CoFeP nanoarrays with an overpotential of 310 mV and 200 mV offering a current density of 50 mA.cm(-2). In addition, an integrated water electrolyzer is developed using MOF CoFeP as an anode and cathode, requiring a cell voltage of 1.78 V to achieve a current density of 50 mA.cm(-2) in an alkaline medium. Our findings suggest that the ligand exchange conversion of the interpenetrated MOF network into an abundant porous structure could have a powerful synergistic effect on the overall water splitting reaction in an alkaline medium.									23	1	0	0	1	0	24			1932-7447	1932-7455		WOS:000550763500007

Vacancy engineering in the crystal lattice is particularly promising in catalyst design, as vacancies could perturb the electronic properties of adjacent atoms to make them catalytically active. Noting that one of the well-adopted approaches to induce vacancies in a crystal structure is the mixing of elements with different valence states, herein, we investigate crystalline NiFe-V-M-O in comparison with NiO. Vacancies are naturally generated to meet charge neutrality when Ni2+ and Fe3+ are mixed via solid solution. As a result of vacancy formation, NiFe-V-M-O exhibits markedly enhanced catalytic performance for the OER. A combined in situ X-ray absorption fine structure and density functional theory analysis reveals that transition metal vacancies in NiFe-V-M-O distort the adjacent Ni's electronic structure toward weakening the interaction with the reaction intermediate *O, which is also associated with the enhanced structural flexibility of NiFe-V-M-O involving the transition metal vacancies. This study demonstrates the usefulness of the "vacancy-local structure-electronic property" relationship as a tool in manipulating the catalytic properties of OER electrocatalysts.									56	2	0	0	8	0	56			2155-5435			WOS:000480503700051

In the photodeposition process, electron-hole pairs are generated in a semiconductor upon illumination and the photogenerated holes are used to oxidize Co2+ ions to Co3+ ions, resulting in the precipitation of Co3+-based catalysts on the semiconductor surface. Both photodeposition of the catalyst and solar O-2 evolution are photo-oxidation reactions using the photogenerated holes. Therefore, photodeposition provides an efficient way to couple oxygen evolution catalysts with photoanodes by naturally placing catalysts at the locations where the holes are most readily available for solar O-2 evolution. In this study Co-based catalysts were photochemically deposited as 10-30 nm nanoparticles on the ZnO surface. The comparison of the photocurrent-voltage characteristics of the ZnO electrodes with and without the presence of the Co-based catalyst demonstrated that the catalyst generally enhanced the anodic photocurrent of the ZnO electrode with its effect more pronounced when the band bending is less significant. The presence of Co-based catalyst on the ZnO photoanode also shifted the onset potential of the photocurrent by 0.23 V to the negative direction, closer to the flat band potential. These results demonstrated that the cobalt-based catalyst can efficiently use the photogenerated holes in ZnO to enhance solar O-2 evolution. The photodeposition method described in this study can be used as a general route to deposit the Co-based catalysts on any semiconductor electrode with a valence band edge located at a more positive potential than the oxidation potential of Co2+ ions.									316	16	0	0	39	0	322			0027-8424			WOS:000272553000017	19934060

In this study, we report on the synthesis and enhanced electrochemical reactivity of nitrogen (N)-doped graphitic carbon nanostructures (CNSs) on metal alloy substrates. The CNS was synthesized on a stainless steel (SUS304) foil by the chemical vapor deposition method. Fe and Cr alloy nanoparticles along with Mn and Ni impurities were observed to be integrated within the N-doped CNS sample from microscopic and spectroscopic analyses. In the electrochemical studies, oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), oxygen evolution reaction (OER), and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) activities were observed to be significantly enhanced for the CNS sample with low overpotential values (ORR = 66 mV, OER = 155.28 mV, and HER = 148.38 mV). Stainless steel is a well-known water splitting catalyst that has played an important role in improving the OER behavior of carbon nanomaterials. It was also observed that Cr2O3 nodules considerably boosted the ORR reactivity of the sample exhibiting a 4e(-) process in alkaline media. The OER activity of the CNS was excellent compared to iridium oxide (IrO2), signifying the efficiency of the developed catalyst. Our study revealed the impact of synthesizing the N-doped CNS on stainless steel alloy substrates (STNCNS) and its effect on the electrochemical reactivity in aqueous media.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			1932-7447	1932-7455		WOS:000726702600007

Herein, by simply controlling synthesis temperature, a bimetallic PBA-derived O,N-codoped Ni-Fe carbide, can be well tuned to optimize structure and OER performance. Importantly, by a series of ex situ and in situ investigations, real active species of NiFeOxHy are in situ formed on the surface during the OER, which reveals a "pre-catalyst" role of O,N-codoped Ni-Fe carbides. Furthermore, it has been successfully applied to highly efficient Zn-air batteries and outplays its RuO2 counterpart. When applied to photoelectrocatalytic water oxidation as the co-catalyst, it improves the performance of the BiVO4 photoanode by enhancing hole collecting and transporting ability. We believe this research not only provides a highly efficient and low-cost electrocatalyst for the OER, but also unveils the "pre-catalyst" role of PBA-derived materials in energy-storage and conversion devices.									13	1	0	0	1	0	12			0947-6539	1521-3765		WOS:000485342500001	31437320

In this study, we report a generalized sol-gel method for the synthesis of various oxide nanocrystals (TiO2, ZnO, Nb2O5, In2O3, SnO2, and Ta2O5) with appropriate transition metal dopants for an efficient electrocatalytic oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Although TiO2 and ZnO nanocrystals alone have little activity, all the Mn-, Fe-, Co-, and Ni-doped nanocrystals exhibit greatly enhanced OER activity. A remarkable finding is that Co dopant produces higher OER activity than the other doped metals. X-ray photoelectron and X-ray absorption spectroscopies revealed the highly oxidized metal ions that are responsible for the enhanced catalytic reactivity. The excellent OER activity of the Co-doped nanocrystals was explained by a synergistic effect in which the oxide matrix effectively guards the most active Co dopants at higher oxidation states by withdrawing the electrons from the metal dopants. The metal-doped NCs exhibit enhanced catalytic activity under visible light irradiation, suggesting their potential as efficient solar-driven OER photoelectrocatalysts.									84	1	0	0	5	0	84			1932-7447			WOS:000348753000036

By tuning the Co/Fe ratio, the optimal Co0.6Fe0.4S2@N-CNTs/rGO exhibits a remarkable oxygen evolution reaction (OER) performance in 1.0 M KOH, in which the overpotential at 10 mA cm(-2) and Tafel slope are recorded as 248 mV (vs. RHE) and 58.3 mV dec(-1), respectively, outmaneuvring commercial RuO2 and most Co/Fe sulfide-based catalysts in recent peer reports. Comprehensive experiment results unravel that the outstanding OER electrocatalytic performance owes to the reinforced synergy between CoS2 and FeS2, the heterostructures constituted by partial CoS2 and FeS2, the confining effect of N-CNTs/rGO for CoS2 and FeS2 nanoparticles, and the high conductivity and large surface of N-CNTs/rGO.

Interestingly, the LSM/NrGO composites demonstrate outstanding catalytic performance in ORR, including high limiting current density and superior onset potential, compared to bare LSM nanocrystals or nitrogen-doped graphene, showing a performance close to that of commercial Pt/C. Moreover, Li-O-2 batteries assembled based on the LSM/NrGO catalysts exhibited brilliant performance, especially during long-term cycling, where the terminal discharge voltage still exceeded 2.31 V after 360 cycles. The excellent catalytic performance is mainly attributed to the large specific surface area (152.24 m(2) g(-1)) of the materials, which provides many catalytic active sites, and the mesoporous structure (2 to 50 nm), which can facilitate the penetration of oxygen molecules into the surface of the nanoparticles and mass transfer.									10	1	0	0	1	0	10			0947-7047	1862-0760		WOS:000407595100002

This ratio is crucial for understanding the final fate of a progenitor star and the nucleosynthesis of elements prior to a Type II supernova; an oxygen rich star is predicted to collapse to a black hole, and a carbon rich star to a neutron star. Type Ia supernovae (SNeIa) are used as standard candles for measuring cosmological distances with the use of an empirical light curve-luminosity stretching factor. It is essential to understand helium burning that yields the carbon/oxygen white dwarf and thus the initial stage of SNeIa. The O-TPC is intended for use with high intensity photon beams extracted from the HIgammaS/TUNL facility at Duke University to study the 16O(gamma,alpha)12C reaction, and thus the direct reaction at energies as low as 0.7 MeV. We are conducting a systematical study of the best oxygen containing gas with light emitting admixture(s) for use in such an O-TPC. Preliminary results with CO2+TEA mixture were obtained.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			1219-7580			INSPEC:9135396

Herein, we successfully synthesized FeCoNi nanoalloys embedded in a hierarchical N-rich carbon matrix (FeCoNi@HNC), which served as an efficient and durable electrocatalyst for both the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in alkaline media. Experimental investigations and density functional theory (DFT) calculations revealed that the core-shell structure of FeCoNi@HNC was highly beneficial for tuning the adsorption/desorption of oxygen intermediates on the N-rich carbon shell through electron penetration effects, thereby simultaneously delivering outstanding ORR activity (comparable to Pt/C) and OER activity (superior to IrO2/C). Further, the N-rich carbon shell acted as a barrier to prevent excessive oxidation and dissolution of the FeCoNi alloy nanoparticles, thus imparting FeCoNi@HNC with excellent stability in alkaline electrolytes. A prototype zinc-air battery constructed using FeCoNi@HNC exhibited a maximum power density of 109 mW cm(-2) and no obvious increase in the discharge-charge voltage gap over 200 cycles at 5 mA cm(-2), vastly superior battery performance to a battery fabricated using Pt/C + IrO2/C catalysts. Results validate FeCoNi@HNC as a very promising earth-abundant electrocatalyst for rechargeable zinc-air batteries and potentially other energy conversion devices that utilize ORR and OER.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000727438600001

Nevertheless, single-atom electrocatalysts with single metal component cannot further satisfy the demand of catalytic properties. This work developed atomic Co/Ni dual sites in N-doped porous carbon Janus-like frameworks through epitaxial growth of cobalt based MOFs on nickel complexes. Structural characterization and atomic-scale transmission electron microscopy revealed the homogeneously dispersed active sites of Co-Ni alloy and single Co/Ni atoms. Electrochemical data strongly demonstrated the advantages of integrating Co-MOF and Ni complex with different topological structures to form a Janus-like structure. The resultant catalysts afforded onset potential of 0.93 V and half-wave potential of 0.84 V for oxygen reduction reaction in alkaline media, and 0.86 V and 0.73 V in acid media, which is better than single noble-metal-free catalysts, even close to commercial Pt/C. Besides, the catalysts also exhibited good oxygen evolution reaction performance (a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at a potential of 1.59 V) and overvoltage between ORR and OER is 0.78 V. Density functional theory calculations indicated the high electrocatalytic activities are originated from the synergetic effect of atomic Co/Ni-N-C bonds and microstructure of the prepared materials. This work paves a new avenue for the development of multiatomic electrocatalysts for energy conversion.									225	17	0	0	11	0	227			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000461002800012

The evolution of the fuel molecules, oxygen, C2H4, and center dot CH3, and the underlying reactions, were obtained by systematic analysis of the simulation trajectories with the aid of VARxMD, a unique tool for ReaxFF MD reaction analysis developed by the authors' group. The simulated consumption of fuel and oxygen, as well as the amount of ethylene and methyl radicals, in RP-3 oxidation are of the same magnitude in the ReaxFF MD simulations as that predicted by CHEMKIN under the same temperature and initial pressure conditions. Based on the chemical structures of all the species and the full set of reactions obtained, the detailed mechanisms observed in the simulations broadly agree with the previous literature. The first reactions of the fuel molecules can be categorized into H-abstraction and internal scission, with the latter dominating under various temperature conditions. Observation and statistical analysis of the oxygen reactions reveal that small species of C-1-C-3 are involved in a relatively large proportion, which may allow the simplification of the reaction mechanism. A reaction network for RP-3 oxidation at high temperature is obtained through the analysis of the reaction mechanisms. This work demonstrates that the ReaxFF MD method, combined with the unique reaction analysis capability of VARxMD, provides useful insights into the mechanism of fuel combustion and should aid the construction of combustion mechanism libraries.									11	4	0	0	0	0	12			1000-6818			WOS:000378824300011

Herein, a one-dimensional mesoporous double layered tubular structure, where Co9S8, nanocrystals are incorporated into nitrogen, sulfur codoped carbon, is successfully synthesized via the coordinated-assisted polymerization and sacrificial template methods. The double-layered tubular structure provides for a large electrochemically active surface area and promotes fast mass transfer. Cobalt oxides/oxyhydroxides, which are evolved from the sulfides during the catalytic processes, as the main active sites efficiently catalyze the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER), in cooperation with the Co-N-C and heteroatom-induced active sites. Hence, it demonstrates excellent bifunctional electrocatalytic activity with the overvoltage between the OER potential at 10 mA cm(-2) (E-10) and ORR half-wave potential (E-1/2) of 0.707 V, which is superior to most of precious-metal-free bifunctional oxygen electrocatalysts reported recently, as well as the state-of-art Pt/C and RuO2 catalysts.									55	5	0	0	3	0	56			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000446919800021	30199229

The as-obtained MG endows a transparent sheet architecture of one to four atomic layers. Simultaneously, MG with different M amounts is synthesized by tuning the chlorination parameters. Among them, the novel and representative Cr-self-doped graphene with optimal Cr amount (4.81 at%) demonstrates the outstanding electrochemical performance. It presents an energy density of 686 W h per kg electrode and a power density of more than 391 W per kg electrode as anode material of Li ion batteries, and four-fold activity against the commercial iridium oxide electrode toward oxygen evolution reaction as well as a comparable oxygen reduction reaction performance to the commercial platinum catalyst. Moreover, this method is readily scalable to produce graphene and MG electrode materials on industrial levels.									58	1	0	0	0	0	58			1616-301X	1616-3028		WOS:000394683400005

Along with the change in different annealing temperatures, the effects of different metal substrates were also explored. Cyclic Voltammetry was used to analyze the redox transitions of all annealing temperatures on the nickel and titanium substrates. Steady state polarization curves (also known as Tafel Plots) were used to determine tafel slopes, Open Circuit Potential decay analysis was also used to determine tafel slopes. Reaction orders of the 350 degrees C nickel MnxOy electrode were determined and calculated as a half reaction order. A mechanism for this electrode is also proposed.

Herein, we report a novel non-precious metal bifunctional electrocatalyst, chiral macromolecular metal-organic frameworks with lattice strain on nickel foam (LS-CMMOFs/NF), by replacing disulfonic acid with mono-sulfonic acid for effective and controlled introduction of lattice strain. Under alkaline conditions, LS-CMMOFs/NF at 6% lattice expansion (6% LS-CMMOFs/NF) have the best catalytic performances for oxygen evolution reaction (OER), hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and OWS, the activity of the catalyst is significantly improved compared with that of the original CMMOFs/NF (O-CMMOFs/NF). The 6%LS-CMMOFs/NF deliver tiny overpotentials of 100 mV (HER), 137 mV (OER), total voltages of 1.467 V (OWS) at 10 mA cm(-2) and maintain100-hours excellent stability. Noteworthy, the OER can reach 500 mA cm(-2), with promising industrial applications. Catalytic mechanism studies, such as operando Raman, operando FTIR and density functional theory calculations indicate that lattice strain effectively enables electrons to pass through Ni/Co 3d-O 2p-Fe 3d more rapidly, thus optimizing metal 3d orbitals, which in turn activates the active surface species (Ni/Co-OOH for OER and Ni/Co-N for HER) and ultimately increases the electrocatalytic activity.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000788059100003

However, it is difficult to prevent metal nanoparticles aggregation during pyrolysis process. Herein, we reported the efficient synthesis of nitrogen doped carbon hollow nanospheres with cobalt nanoparticles (Co NP, ca. 10 nm in size) distributed uniformly in the shell via pyrolysis of yolk-shell structured Zn-Co-ZIFs@polydopamine (PDA). PDA acted as both protection layer and carbon source, which successfully prevented the aggregation of cobalt nanoparticles during high-temperature pyrolysis process. The Co NP and N containing carbon (Co NP/NC) hollow nanospheres were active for both oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), affording overpotential of 430 mV at 10 mA/cm(2) for OER in 1 M KOH and comparable half-wave potential to that of Pt/C (0.80 V vs RHE) for ORR in 0.1 M KOH. The superior performance of carbon hollow nanospheres for both OER and ORR was mainly attributed to its small metal nanoparticles, N-doping and hollow nanostructure. The protection and confinement effect that originated from PDA coating strategy could be extended to the synthesis of other hollow structured carbon materials, especially the ones with small metal nanoparticles.

Combined the experimental results with thermodynamic analysis,the changes of the total oxygen content,inclusion size distribution,particle size and evolution of inclusions were investigated. The obtained results showed that the total oxygen content could be lowered to 0.000 6% and the average size of oxide inclusions was minium as 2.26 mum using the refining slag of 59.4%CaO-24.8%Al_2O_3-9.8%SiO_2- 6%MgO. With the increase of Mg and Ca contents in steel,the evolution of oxide inclusions was:Al_2O_3MgO· Al_2O_3MgOCaO-Al_2O_3-MgO complex inclusion(MgO surrounded by CaO-Al_2O_3). At the earlier stage of slag/steel reaction, the dominant inclusions in steel was MgO·Al_2O_3,whereas the inclusions were mainly MgO and CaO-Al_2O_3- MgO at the later stage. The evolution of oxide inclusions observed in the experiments agreed well with that predicted by thermodynamic calculation. The size of most oxide inclusions was smaller than 5 mum.			利用实验室渣-钢平衡试验研究了高碱度精炼渣对GCr15轴承钢中w(T[O])和夹杂物的影响。结合试验结果和热力学分析,探讨了钢中w(T[O])、夹杂物尺寸分布和粒径大小的变化规律,以及氧化物夹杂的转变过程。研究结果表明,碱度为6时,精炼渣(59.4%CaO-24.8%Al_2O_3-9.8%SiO_2-6%MgO)可将钢中w(T[O])控制在0.0006%以内,氧化物夹杂平均尺寸最小为2.26mum。随着钢中w([Ca])和w([Mg])的增加,钢中氧化物夹杂转变过程为Al_2O_3MgO·Al_2O_3MgOCaO-Al_2O_3-MgO复合夹杂物(核心为MgO,外围包裹着CaO-Al_2O_3)。渣-钢反应前期钢中以MgO·Al_2O_3为主,后期以MgO和CaO-Al_2O_3-MgO复合夹杂物为主。氧化物夹杂转变的试验结果与热力学分析结果相一致,大多数氧化物夹杂尺寸小于5mum。						0	1	0		0	0	1			0449-749X			CSCD:5841836

Oxygen diffusion-reaction model can predict the time-dependent oxidation state and evolution of oxide layers in unidirectional composites. With given oxidation state and presumed initial cracks, extend finite element method (XFEM) can be used to calculate the damage evolution due to oxidation-induced stress in the composites.

Here, p-n junctions are constructed in 3D free-standing FeNi-LDH/CoP/carbon cloth (CC) electrode (LDH=layered double hydroxide). The positively charged FeNi-LDH in the space-charge region can significantly boost oxygen evolution reaction. Therefore, the j at 1.485 V (vs. RHE) of FeNi-LDH/CoP/CC achieves ca. 10-fold and ca. 100-fold increases compared to those of FeNi-LDH/CC and CoP/CC, respectively. Density functional theory calculation reveals OH- has a stronger trend to adsorb on the surface of FeNi-LDH side in the p-n junction compared to individual FeNi-LDH further verifying the synergistic effect in the p-n junction. Additionally, it represents excellent activity toward water splitting.

In this work, a mesoporous CoP/Fe2P doped with 5 % Ce by a simple nanocasting method is designed as a superior electrocatalyst for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The well-designed composite delivers an efficient electrocatalytic activity with a low overpotential of 250 mV at 10 mA cm(-2)and excellent long-term stability with no degradation after 10 h of electrochemical OER test, superior to that of the state-of-the-art RuO(2)electrocatalyst in alkaline electrolyte. A comprehensive analysis demonstrates that the outstanding OER performance is due to the desirable combination of the highly exposed active centers in the Ce-doped bimetallic phosphides, efficient mass transfer, and effective electron conduction owing to the hierarchically mesoporous hybridization. Furthermore, the synergistic effect between Ce and CoP/Fe2P accelerates the migration rate of electrons/ions and increases the electrochemical active area. This excellent OER performance observed by Ce doping of CoP/Fe2P makes them possible candidates toward OER in alkaline electrolytes.									9	2	0	0	0	0	9			0947-6539	1521-3765		WOS:000569385000001	32666610

Here, a non-3d metal modulation strategy is presented for enhancing the OER activity of cobalt imidazolate frameworks. Two isomorphous frameworks [Co-4(MO4)(eim)(6)] (M=Mo or W, Heim=2-ethylimidazole) having Co(eim)(3)(MO4) units and high water stabilities were designed and synthesized. In different neutral media, the Mo-modulated framework coated on a glassy carbon electrode shows the best OER performances (1 mA cm(-2) at an overpotential of 210 mV in CO2-saturated 0.5 m KHCO3 electrolyte and 2/10/22 mA cm(-2) at overpotential of 388/490/570 mV in phosphate buffer solution) among non-precious metal catalysts and even outperforms RuO2. Spectroscopic measurements and computational simulations revealed that the non-3d metals modulate the electronic structure of Co for optimum reactant/product adsorption and tailor the energy of rate-determining step to a more moderate value.									82	4	0	0	3	0	82			1433-7851	1521-3773		WOS:000455818400014	30320948

Through engineering of the anion chemistry of cobaltosic oxide nanoparticles to adjust the composition, morphology and crystallographic orientation of the Mo-based metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), and then a pyrolysis-phosphidation process, the Co-Mo-P@NCNS-600 electrocatalyst exhibits excellent electrocatalytic performance (overpotentials (eta(10)) of 270 mV for the oxygen evolution reaction and 62 mV for the hydrogen evolution reaction), benefiting from the well-designed structure and the electronic state control. Furthermore, when the Co-Mo-P@NCNS-600 is used in a water-splitting device, it can reach a 10 mA cm(-2) current density at low potential (1.58 V), and exhibits excellent stability for 380 000 s (105.6 h). Density functional theory (DFT) results indicate that the successful construction of the Co-Mo-P active site will effectively modulate the intrinsic electronic properties and improve the electrochemical performance.									15	1	0	0	0	0	15			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000609149500037

In this work, we synthesize the hierarchical structure of NiFe(OH)(x)/VS/NF nanosheets using vanadium sulfide (VS) layer coating on the nickel foam (NF) as substrate. VS on the surface of NF can make effect on the distribution and morphology of NiFe(OH)(x). The vertical NiFe(OH)(x) nanosheets supported VS/NF can not only provide abundant active sites for OER but also have the advantages of excellent conductivity substrate. The three dimensional skeleton structure of NF can also faster oxygen diffusion process, which suggests outstanding electrocatalytic activity in alkaline medium. Employing it for water splitting with a current density of 200 mA cm(-2) is achievable at a low voltage of 1.506 V vs. RHE with remarkable long-term stability. Moreover, the synergistic hybridization of layered VS/NF with layered double hydroxides (LDH) materials enlightens the design and fabrication of promising hybrid materials. This work may offer a viable route to design the advanced electrode materials for OER electrocatalysts.									10	0	0	0	0	0	10			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000471830700111

Herein, cobalt-based hydroxide nanoparticles @ N-doping carbonic framework (CoOHCat@NCF) core-shell structures have been designed as highly stable and efficient OER/ORR bifunctional catalysts. The obtained composite shows enhanced catalytic activities and excellent stability in alkaline media. In the OER, a high turnover frequency (2.03 s(-1) at an overpotential of 0.36 V), low overpotential at high current density (100 mA.cm(-2) requiring an overpotential of 0.38 V), and excellent stability (100 mA.cm(-2) for one week with no activity loss) have been achieved. Furthermore, although cobalt species-based catalysts are known as good ORR catalysts, their hybridization with NCF obtained from metal organic frameworks successfully enhanced their ORR activities. The efficient activity of CoOHCat@NCF as a bifunctional oxygen electrocatalyst can be ascribed to the core-shell structures stabilizing the active catalytic sites and the porous shell structure favoring electrocatalysis-related mass transport.									33	5	0	0	1	0	33			1998-0124	1998-0000		WOS:000424049300028

Electrochemical noise measurements were performed by using RuO2 as a benchmark catalyst and the perovskite La0.58Sr0.4Fe0.8Co0.2O3 as a non-noble metal OER catalyst with lower intrinsic conductivity. Changes in the current during the OER originate from variations in electrolyte resistance during the formation of the gas phase and partial coverage of the active area. Fluctuations observed in current and conductance transients were used to establish the contribution from the ohmic overpotential and to determine the characteristic frequency of oxygen evolution. The proposed quantitative determination of gas bubble growth and departure opens up the route for a rational interface design by considering gas bubble growth and departure as a main contributing factor to the overall electrocatalytic activity at high current densities.									9	0	0	0	1	0	9			1864-5631	1864-564X		WOS:000349146600020	25556938

Due to the few methods available for in situ molecular level investigations in electrochemical environments only few data are available to electrochemists. Ex situ experiments in ultra high vacuum provide useful informations on elementary reaction steps like adsorption, desorption and dissociation.The interaction of water with clean, potassium and oxygen precovered Ni(lll) was investigated by XPS. On the clean Ni(lll) surface we found two different adsorption states for molecular water and could determine their desorption energy and preexponential factor.Potassium or oxygen precoverages on Ni(lll) are used to model electrical fields in the electrochemical double layer. Dissociation of water to OH + H is induced by K or NiO on the electrode. A new molecular binding state with stronger interaction with the surface is observed as well. In order to analyze details of the kinetics of the oxygen evolution reaction on a polished rotating disk nickel electrode in alkaline solution, impedance spectra have been determined at potentials between reversible oxygen potential and oxygen evolution reaction at frequencies from 10 mHz to 64 kHz. The impedance spectra can be divided into two different groups, with a narrow transition state at 0.5 V, thus reflecting two different reaction mechanisms or a change of the rate determining step. These impedance spectra can be simulated by an equivalent circuit with a profile of conductivity perpendicular to the surface (according to L. Young). An exact description of the system is possible using the potential dependence of the Young impedance parameters.					11th World Hydrogen Energy Conference (11 WHEC)11th World Hydrogen Energy Conference (11 WHEC)	JUN 23-28, 1996JUN 23-28, 1996	Deut Gesell Chem Apparatewesen Chem Tech & Biotechnol e V; Int Assoc Hydrogen Energy; State Govt Baden Wurttemberg; Lord Mayor City Stuttgart; BASF AG, Ludwigshafen; Bayer Motorenwerke AG, Munchen; Bayernwerk AG, Munchen; Daimler Benz AG, Stuttgart; Deut Lufthansa AG, Frankfurt am Main; Hamburg Elekt Werke AG, Hamburg; Hoechst AG, Frankfurt am Main; Huls AG, Marl; Landesgirokasse LG Stift, Stuttgart; Linde AG, Hollriegelskreuth; Messer Griesheim GmbH, Krefeld; PreussenElektra, Hannover; Robert Bosch GmbH, Stuttgart; US DOE; Tech Werke Stadt Stuttgart AG; Deut Forschungsanstalt Luftfahrt & Raumfahrt e V; Deut Phys Gesell, Arbeitskreis Energie; Energietech Gesell VDE; European Federat Chem Engn; Forum Zukunftsenergien e V; VDI, Gesell Energietech; Zentrum SonnenenergieForschung & WasserstoffForschungDeut Gesell Chem Apparatewesen Chem Tech & Biotechnol e V; Int Assoc Hydrogen Energy; State Govt Baden Wurttemberg; Lord Mayor City Stuttgart; BASF AG, Ludwigshafen; Bayer Motorenwerke AG, Munchen; Bayernwerk AG, Munchen; Daimler Benz AG, Stuttgart; Deut Lufthansa AG, Frankfurt am Main; Hamburg Elekt Werke AG, Hamburg; Hoechst AG, Frankfurt am Main; Huls AG, Marl; Landesgirokasse LG Stift, Stuttgart; Linde AG, Hollriegelskreuth; Messer Griesheim GmbH, Krefeld; PreussenElektra, Hannover; Robert Bosch GmbH, Stuttgart; US DOE; Tech Werke Stadt Stuttgart AG; Deut Forschungsanstalt Luftfahrt & Raumfahrt e V; Deut Phys Gesell, Arbeitskreis Energie; Energietech Gesell VDE; European Federat Chem Engn; Forum Zukunftsenergien e V; VDI, Gesell Energietech; Zentrum SonnenenergieForschung & WasserstoffForschung	STUTTGART, GERMANYSTUTTGART, GERMANY	2	0	0	0	0	0	2						WOS:A1996BG96N00279		
J	Lee, Seung Woo; Baik, Chaekyung; Kim, Tae-Yang; Pak, Chanho								Three-dimensional mesoporous Ir-Ru binary oxides with improved activity and stability for water electrolysis								CATALYSIS TODAY				352		SI		39	46		10.1016/j.cattod.2019.10.004				AUG 1 2020	2020	Water electrolysis (WE) involves both the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Because the kinetics of the OER are much slower than those of the HER, the overall efficiency of electrolysis is decreased. Furthermore, since the OER occurs in extremely harsh environments, stability of materials needs to be considered for WE application. To overcome this challenge, researchers have conducted many studies to investigate OER catalysts. In the current study, to achieve a balance between activity and stability, three-dimensional mesoporous IrO2/RuO2 (MS-IrO2/RuO2) was prepared via nano-replication and the Adams method sequentially, and for comparison, Ir-Ru binary oxides (IrO2/RuO2) with a high specific surface area were synthesized using commercial RuO2 via the Adams method. Thereafter, the effects of the structural and electrochemical characteristics of the catalysts on the OER activity were analyzed. MS-IrO2/RuO2 with an Ir/Ru molar ratio of 1:10 was shown to have a lower overpotential (300 mV at 10 mA cm(geo)(-2)) than conventional IrO2/RuO2 (340 mV). After the accelerated stability test for over 2 h using the chronopotentiometry technique, the increase in overpotential was as low as 22 mV for MS-IrO2/RuO2, lower than that of IrO2/RuO2 (44 mV). The results of this work are anticipated to prove useful to aid researchers in better understanding viable approaches for improving OER performance.									22	2	0	0	0	0	22			0920-5861	1873-4308		WOS:000535914800006

Herein, the fabrication of multi-cation incorporated Fe2+/3+/Co2+ species into selenides nanorods (Fe@Co/Se-2-NRs) and corresponding analysis of their catalytic activity for electrochemical (EC) and solar-driven water splitting as a purpose of the composition are reported. This efficient approach can fabulously endow electronic structure modulation and the direct evidence of electron-transfer-route between transition-metals and selenides, which are vital to improving the electrocatalytic activity, has never been confirmed before. For the first time, we explored the electron-transfer route of intensely-coupled Fe@Co/Se-2-NRs catalyst, in which the Fe2+/3+/Co2+ species strongly-coupled to selenide through the Fe-coordinated Co-bridged-bond. Finally, density functional theory calculations disclose that the multi-cation doping effects into selenides are vital for enhanced electrocatalytic performance.									19	0	0	0	2	0	19			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000787903800002

In this work, we report the synthesis of cobalt nanoparticles (Co NPs) embedded in nitrogen doped carbon (NC) on carbon cloth (CC) by a two-step method to obtain Co@NC/CC and the application for both electrochemical assisted catalytic oxidation of phenol and electrochemical water splitting. An ultra-high activity could be obtained for the electrochemical catalytic oxidation of phenol, with the rate constant at 1.340 min(-1), much larger than the catalytic oxidation process (0.21 min(-1)). Moreover, Co@NC/CC exhibits remarkable activities in both hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Especially, a very early HER overpotential of 118 mV is achieved at 10 mAcm(-2) in 1 M KOH. The synergistic effect between Co and NC and the intimate interface are proposed to be the main cause of the enhanced activity. The free-standing and multi-functional Co@NC/CC electrode contains no noble metal, and should have great potential both in wastewater remediation and water splitting. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Herein, for the first time, we present metallic selenium (M-Se) as electrocatalytic materials for water electrolysis. M-Se is synthesized through pH manipulation by a facile hydrothermal synthesis approach. We demonstrate that the M-Se electrocatalyst can reach a current density of 50 mA cm(-2) with a low overpotential of 217, 242, and 444 mV for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), oxygen evolution reaction (OER), and full cell water splitting, respectively, in alkaline electrolyte.

Herein, an efficient strategy is demonstrated for making the oxygen vacancies dominated cobalt-nickel sulfide interface porous nanowires (NiS2/CoS2-O NWs) for boosting OER catalysis through in situ electrochemical reaction of NiS2/CoS2 interface NWs. Because of the abundant oxygen vacancies and interface porous nanowires structure, they can catalyze the OER efficiently with a low overpotential of 235 mV at j = 10 mA cm(-2) and remarkable long-term stability in 1.0 m KOH. The home-made rechargeable portable Zn-air batteries by using NiS2/CoS2-O NWs as the air-cathode display a very high open-circuit voltage of 1.49 V, which can maintain for more than 30 h. Most importantly, a highly efficient self-driven water splitting device is designed with NiS2/CoS2-O NWs as both anode and cathode, powered by two-series-connected NiS2/CoS2-O NWs-based portable Zn-air batteries.

Here, we report a single-phase manganese tetroxide nanoplates (R20-Mn) by simply rapid annealing of manganese chloride tetrahydrate in air as an efficient and durable electrocatalyst for acidic OER. Agreeing well with the theoretical calculations of significantly reduced overpotentials compared with commercial RuO2 catalyst, R20-Mn delivers an exceptionally intrinsic activity, achieving ultralow overpotentials of 210 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm-2 for OER under acidic media. Therefore, this work provides an important complement to design 2D singlephase transition metal oxides catalysts with prominent activity in acidic water electrolysis. (c) 2021 Elsevier Inc.

Here, we designed and fabricated a vanadium-doped nickel organic framework (V1-x-NixMOF) system by using a facile two-step solvothermal method on nickel foam (NF). The doping of vanadium remarkably elevates the OER activity of V1-x-NixMOF, thus demonstrating better performance than the corresponding single metallic Ni-MOF, NiV-MOF and RuO2 catalysts at high current density (>400 mA cm(-2)). V-0.09-Ni0.91MOF/NF provides a low overpotential of 235 mV and a small Tafel slope of 30.3 mV dec(-1) at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2). More importantly, a water-splitting device assembled with Pt/C/NF and V-0.09-Ni0.91MOF/NF as cathode and anode yielded a cell voltage of 1.96 V@1000 mA cm(-2), thereby outperforming the-state-of-the-art RuO2(+)||Pt/C(-). Our work sheds new insight on preparing stable, efficient OER electrocatalysts and a promising method for designing various MOF-based materials.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0947-6539	1521-3765		WOS:000847824900001	35934676

Specifically, the CdS@3-aminophenol/formaldehyde is carbonized into S/N-FCS. The gas-migrated Ni species are anchored on the surface of S/N-FCS simultaneously, yielding Ni SAs@S/N-FCS. The obtained catalyst exhibits outstanding performance for alkaline oxygen evolution reaction (OER) with an overpotential of 249 mV at 10 mA cm(-2), a small Tafel slope of 56.5 mV dec(-1), and ultra-long stability up to 166 hours without obvious fading.

Despite the chemical similarity of Li and Na, the two systems exhibit distinct characteristics, especially the typically higher charging overpotential observed in Li-oxygen batteries. In previous theoretical and experimental studies, this higher charging overpotential was attributed to factors such as the sluggish oxygen evolution or poor transport property of the discharge product of the Li-oxygen cell; however, a general understanding of the interplay between the discharge products and overpotential remains elusive. Here, we investigated the charging mechanisms with respect to the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) kinetics, charge-carrier conductivity, and dissolution property of various discharge products reported in Li-oxygen and Na-oxygen cells. The OER kinetics were generally faster for superoxides (i.e., LiO2 and NaO2) than for peroxides (i.e., Li2O2 and Na2O2). The electronic and ionic conductivities were also predicted to be significantly higher in superoxide phases than in peroxide phases. Moreover, systematic calculations of the dissolution energy of the discharge products in the electrolyte, which mediate a solution-based OER reaction, revealed that the superoxide phases, particularly NaO2, exhibited markedly low dissolution energy compared with the peroxide phases. These results imply that the formation of superoxides instead of peroxides during discharge may be the key to improving the energy efficiency of metal-oxygen batteries in general.									47	0	0	0	6	0	47			0897-4756	1520-5002		WOS:000367562000028

On the basis of theoretical predictions, a three-dimensional (3D) integrated electrode constructed by P-decorated Ni3S2 nanosheet arrays (Ni3S2IP) was prepared via a facile two-step method. The suitable controlled incorporation of P anions into the Ni3S2 matrix can have little influence on the crystal structure, and meanwhile can effectively modify the electronic structure, increase the concentration of charge carrier, supply more delocalized electrons, facilitate more active sites to be electrically activated, optimize the hydrogen adsorption Gibbs free energy, strengthen the interaction for water molecules, and benefit the oxidation of Ni2+ to NO+ oxo-/hydroxides. As a result, the freshly achieved 3D Ni3S2IP electrode exhibits higher activity with lower overpotential toward HER and OER, in comparison with its pristine counterpart. Furthermore, when employed in an overall electrolytic cell as both cathode and anode, it can reduce the required overvoltage of 100 mV for reaching 10 mA cm(-2) current density, verifying the great potential of anion engineering in the design of bifunctional materials for overall water splitting.									19	1	0	0	1	0	20			2574-0962			WOS:000458706000055

Herein, a bifunctional oxygen reaction electrocatalyst with excellent activity and stability constructed using the peasecod-like N-doped carbon nanotubes (N/CNT) in situ confinement encapsulate bimetallic FeCu alloy (FeCu-N/C). The bimetallic FeCu alloy embedded into N/CNT that inhibits serious polymerization of copper, increases Fe/Cu-N bimetallic active sites, improves conductivity, reduces the energy barrier of oxygen reaction and speeds up reaction kinetics, thus obtaining efficient ORR/OER performance. The optimal FeCu-N/C electrocatalyst reveal more positive half-wave potential for ORR, smaller over-potential for OER and lower ORR/OER potential gap than those of commercial grade Pt/C, IrO2 and many reported catalysts. Moreover, the zinc-air batteries constructed using FeCu-N/C as the air electrode indicate the high power density and excellent stability. The alkaline anion exchange membrane fuel cells assembled with FeCu-N/C as cathode also exhibit enhanced power density compared to single metal-based catalysts (Fe-N/C and Cu-N/C). This work demonstrates potential use of FeCu-N/C for energy conversion and storage applications, provides a new sight for the reasonable design of bifunctional oxygen reaction electrocatalysts.

Here we employ a solid-state Li4+xTi5O12/LiPON/LixV2O5 cell and examine in situ the chemistry of Li-O-2 reaction products on LixV2O5 as a function of applied voltage under ultra high vacuum (UHV) and at 500 mtorr of oxygen pressure using ambient pressure X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (APXPS). Under UHV, lithium intercalated into LixV2O5 while molecular oxygen was reduced to form lithium peroxide on LixV2O5 in the presence of oxygen upon discharge. Interestingly, the oxidation of Li2O2 began at much lower overpotentials (similar to 240 mV) than the charge overpotentials of conventional Li-O-2 cells with aprotic electrolytes (similar to 1000 mV). Our study provides the first evidence of reversible lithium peroxide formation and decomposition in situ on an oxide surface using a solid-state cell, and new insights into the reaction mechanism of Li-O-2 chemistry.									161	4	0	0	9	0	162			2045-2322			WOS:000309525700003	23056907

Herein, we design new disperse metal atom catalysts with single-, dual-, and tri-metal sites coordinated by nitrogen and study their catalytic activities by using the density functional theory methods. The electronic structures, reaction free energies, reaction pathways, and over-potentials were calculated to predict the catalytic activities for OER and ORR. The results show that introducing heterogeneous metal sites can break the scaling factor, significantly enhancing the bifunctional catalytic activities. An intrinsic descriptor was found to well describe the catalytic activities and provide a better understanding of the local electrical field effects on catalytic activities. Among all the catalysts studied in this work, ZnCo metal pairs show the preeminent bifunctional catalytic activities. Dual-metal catalysts generally suppress the competing two-electron-transfer reaction (formation of H2O2) while facilitating the four-electron-transfer ORR and perform better than single- and tri-metal ones and the best commercial noble metal catalysts (e.g., Pt and RuO2). The predictions are consistent with the previous experimental results. This work provides a theoretical base for rational design of disperse metal atom catalysts with excellent bifunctional catalytic activities.									6	0	0	0	1	0	6			1932-7447	1932-7455		WOS:000608876900013

Using density functional theory calculations, the structural, electronic, and magnetic properties of SSX-Gr with different C/X ratios (X = H or F) are systematically studied. Then, a detailed mechanism on the dissociation of O-2 and the migration of Li on the SSX-Gr is revealed, based on which C6X and C8X are confirmed as the potential candidates as cathode catalysts. The studies on reaction pathways suggest that the four-electron pathway is the more possible catalytic pathway for the selected SSX-Gr. The free energy diagrams for discharging and charging processes catalyzed by SSX-Gr reveal that C6F exhibits the highest application potential due to its considerably low oxygen reduction overpotential (0.83 V) and oxygen evolution overpotential (1.47 V). The extra spins induced by single-side functionalization endow graphene with the electrocatalytic activity.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000678115900001	34477623

The overpotential at 10 mA cm(-2) was 235 mV in a 0.5 M H2SO4 solution at a catalyst loading of 0.765 mg cm(-2) for Co-N-C. In a 1 M KOH solution, the overpotential was only slightly increased by 35 mV. The high activity and excellent durability (negligible loss after 1000 cycles in both acidic and alkaline media) make this carbon-based catalyst a promising alternative to noble metals for HER. Electrochemical and density functional theory (DFT) calculation results suggested that transition metals and nitrogen played a critical role in activity enhancement. The active sites for HER might be associated with metal/N/C moieties, which have been also proposed as reaction centers for oxygen reduction reaction.									53	5	0	0	1	0	55			1932-7447	1932-7455		WOS:000391160400017

However, PEMWE requires the use of expensive electrocatalysts; the currently available electrocatalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) depend on noble metals (Ir, Ru). Since noble metals are expensive, commercialization of PEMWE remains elusive. In addition, PEMWE suffers from the very slow kinetics of the OER in acidic media. Thus, the development of noble-metal-reduced, highly active, and acid-compatible oxygen evolution electrocatalysts is needed for the commercialization of PEMWE to be viable. In this regard, perovskite oxides have great potential for application as OER electrocatalysts in acidic media, because their multimetal-oxide forms can reduce the use of noble metals, and their high structural and compositional flexibility can modulate the electronic structure and OER activity. In this review, current knowledge regarding state-of-the-art perovskite oxides for acidic water oxidation electrocatalysts is summarized. First, the fundamental OER mechanism of electrocatalysts in acidic media is introduced briefly. Second, Ir- and Ru-based perovskite oxides in acidic solutions are provided, focusing on their stability and OER activity. Finally, some challenges facing the development of perovskite oxide-based electrocatalysts, and a perspective on their future are discussed.									50	4	0	0	0	0	50			1614-6832	1614-6840		WOS:000585249200001

The IL is functionalized with H2PO4- anions, providing P heteroatoms in the final carbon. Simultaneously, the cations of the IL feature nitrogen in their structures, which dopes the carbon frameworks with nitrogen heteroatoms. Therefore, the N, P co-doped carbon material can be easily prepared with the PIL as the precursor via a one-pot process. The composition of the carbon makes it a potential metal-free electrocatalyst for ORR. As expected, the N, P co-doped carbon (C-1) exhibits an improved catalytic activity towards ORR compared with its N doped carbon (C-2) counterpart in alkaline solutions. The catalytic performance of C-1 toward ORR is also higher than that of the N, P co-doped carbon derived from a non-polymerizable ionic liquid. The results from scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) measurement, etc. confirmed that the defective graphite carbon with limited porosity and doped with N, P can be obtained via the present process. Given its highest catalytic performance toward ORR, the C-VNP derived from the polymerizable ionic liquid possesses the best intrinsic catalytic activity due to the co-doping effects among the investigated samples, consistent with the density functional theory (DFT) calculation. The present work provides new opportunities for the application of polymerizable ionic liquids and the preparation of metal-free N, P co-doped carbon as an ORR catalyst. The prepared C-1 sample also shows some catalytic performance toward the oxygen evolution reaction and hydrogen evolution reaction.									32	3	0	0	1	0	32			2044-4753	2044-4761		WOS:000427152800021

FeMn-DSAC exhibits remarkable bifunctional activities for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Control experiments and density functional theory calculations reveal that the catalytic activity arises from the cooperative effect of the Fe/Mn dual-sites aiding *OOH dissociation as well as the porous 2D nanosheet structure promoting active sits exposure and mass transfer during the reaction process. The excellent bifunctional activity of FeMn-DSAC enables the ZAB to operate efficiently at ultra-low temperature of -40 degrees C, delivering 30 mW cm(-2) peak power density and retaining up to 86 % specific capacity from the room temperature counterpart.									66	2	0	0	3	0	66			1433-7851	1521-3773		WOS:000748150900001	34994045	
J	Bouri, M.; Aschauer, U.								Density functional theory study of the oxygen evolution activity on Sr2TaO3N surfaces [arXiv]								arXiv								9 pp., supl. 11 pp.	9 pp., supl. 11 pp.						31 May 2019	2019	Solar water splitting has attracted much attention as a clean and renewable route to produce hydrogen fuel. Since the oxygen evolution half-reaction (OER) requires high overpotentials, much research has focused on finding catalyst materials that minimize this energy loss. Oxynitrides with a layered perovskite structure have the potential to combine the superior photocatalytic properties of layered perovskite oxides with enhanced visible-light absorption caused by the band gap narrowing due to less electronegative nitrogen ions. In this paper, we study the OER on the (001) and (100) surfaces of the layered oxynitride Sr2TaO3N using density functional theory (DFT) calculations to obtain the OER free energy profiles and to determine the required overpotentials at various sites on each surface. We find that the reconstructed grooved (100) surface is most relevant for photocatalysis due to suitable band-edge positions combined with a low overpotential and good carrier mobility perpendicular to the surface.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0						INSPEC:19069922		
J	Hui, Bin; Chen, Hongjiao; Zhou, Chengfeng; Cai, Liping; Zhang, Kewei; Quan, Fengyu; Yang, Dongjiang								Biochar aerogel-based electrocatalyst towards efficient oxygen evolution in acidic media								BIOCHAR				4	1					39	10.1007/s42773-022-00163-0				DEC 2022	2022	The controllable synthesis of oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrocatalyst is an urgent need to advance the development of sustainable energy conversion and storage. However, the OER efficiency in acidic media is seriously hindered by slow reaction kinetics. The traditional acidic OER electrocatalysts are more prone to be oxidized and corroded as results of unstable carrier structures and variable electronic states of active species. Herein, a high-performing biochar aerogel (BA) based electrocatalyst were realistically designed and synthetized via joint utilization of the terrestrial lignin and seaweed polysaccharide as carbon sources. Originating from the induction effect of "egg-box" structure in alginate and the self-template effect of lignosulfonate, the BA decorated with Ru/RuS2 particles was synthesized triumphantly. The as-synthesized electrocatalyst required a low overpotential of 228 mV to attain 10 mA cm(-2) in 0.5 M H2SO4 and exhibited a good stability for over 12,000 s. The good activity was strongly dependent on the assembled unique two-dimensional/three-dimensional (2D/3D) channels in carbon aerogels. Notably, the numerous defective sites at carbon could strongly interact with the Ru/RuS2 heterojunction for remarkably enhancing the catalytic activity and stability of whole catalytic system in acidic media. This work puts forward a novel and effective strategy towards the enhancement of the acidic OER process by rational regulations of the BA and the coupling effect in micro-interface.									3	0	0	0	1	0	3			2524-7972	2524-7867		WOS:000829050500001

The active anode (IrO2-Sb2O5-SnO2/Ti) was prepared via standard thermal decomposition method and 4-nitrophenol (4-NP) chosen as the model organic compound. It is firstly confirmed that this anode does follow the "active" anode mechanism, with the rate of 4-NP oxidation being dependent on the coverage adsorbed oxygen on the surface of the anode. This surface coverage can be estimated by fitting steady-state polarisation curves with a micro-kinetic model describing the oxygen evolution behaviour of the anode. This surface coverage dependent oxidation rate can only be observed at relatively low overpotentials where mass transport limitations are avoided. At high overpotentials, the rate of oxidation is completely controlled by mass transfer of 4-NP to the anode surface, with the measured and calculated rate constants agreeing closely. It is also shown that the instantaneous current efficiency can be directly calculated from the measured pseudo first-order rate constant in both the kinetic and mass transport limited regimes. Using this analysis method, it was found that the instantaneous current efficiency for 4-NP oxidation is less than 100% in both regimes and only approached 100% at very low overpotentials. This finding is important as in prior literature, it is often believed that the instantaneous current efficiency of electrochemical wastewater oxidation will be 100% provided that mass transfer does not limit the process, due to an underlying assumption that the rate of organic oxidation is much larger than the OER.									4	0	0	0	1	0	4			1868-2529	1868-5994		WOS:000418815500004

Herein, a facile electrochemical etching method is proposed for the controllable tailoring of the defects in a three-dimensional (3D) open nanonetcage CoZnRuOx heterostructure via the in situ electrochemical etching to remove partial ZnO. The highly open 3D nanostructures, numerous defects, and multicomponent heterointerfaces endow the CoZnRuOx nanonetcages with more accessible active sites, moderated local electronic structure, and strong synergistic effect, thereby enabling them to not only deliver an ultralow overpotential (244 mV @ 10 mA cm(-2)) for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) but also high-performance overall water electrolysis by coupling with commercial Pt/C, with a potential of 1.52 V at 10 mA cm(-2). Moreover, experiments and characterizations also reveal that the remaining Zn2+ can facilitate OH- adsorption and charge transfer, which also further improves the electrocatalytic OER performance. This work proposes a promising strategy for creating surface defects in heterostructured TMOs and provides insights to understand the defect-and interface-induced enhancement of OER electrocatalysis.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000849769500001	35993830

In this work, CuxO nanoflakes have been successfully in situ grown on nanoporous Cu foil via a facile electrooxidation method. A Ga-assisted surface Ga-Cu alloying-dealloying is adopted to realize the formation of a nanoporous Cu layer on the flexible Cu foil. The following electrooxidation, at a constant potential, modifies the nanoporous Cu layer with CuxO nanoflakes. The optimum CuxO/Cu electrode (O-Cu-2h) delivers the maximum areal capacitance of 0.745 F cm(-2) (410.27 F g(-1)) at 0.2 mA cm(-2) and maintains 94.71% of the capacitance after 12,000 cycles. The supercapacitor consisted of the O-Cu-2h as the positive electrode and activated carbon as the negative electrode has an energy density of 24.20 Wh kg(-1) and power density of 0.65 kW kg(-1). The potential of using the electrode as oxygen evolution reaction catalysts is also investigated. The overpotential of O-Cu-2h at 10 mA cm(-2) is 394 mV; however, the long-term stability still needs further improvement.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0				2079-4991		WOS:000816696300001	35745461

In particular, perovskite oxides are reputable for high activity toward the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Here, we revisited the list of active perovskite oxides constructed based on theoretical oxygen binding energies of reaction intermediates to the catalyst surface. From this list, Ru-based perovskites, i.e. SrRuO3 and LaRuO3, have been predicted as active perovskites to exhibit a particularly high OER activity. We report on the stability of nanoscaled SrRuO3 perovskite prepared by a simple and scalable flame synthesis method. Attempts to obtain LaRuO3 were made; however, its DFT calculated phase diagram suggests that its perovskite phase is not thermodynamically stable, which supports our experimental results such that only a mixture of different La Ru O phases has been obtained. Nanoscaled SrRuO3 is evaluated for its electrochemical activity with a particular emphasis pointed toward stability in both alkaline and acidic media. Through conjoining electrochemical methods, operando X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS), and theoretical calculations, we show that SrRuO3 exhibits trivial activity toward OER that decreases promptly. The loss in activity is rationalized through DFT based computations, which corroboratively suggest the poor chemical stability of both selected perovskites. Regardless of the predicted theoretical OER activity, the intrinsic instability strongly suggests that Sr- and La-based ruthenium oxides are not viable catalysts for OER in aqueous media. This further suggests that their activities are independent of their binding energies between intermediates and catalyst surface but rather closely associated with material dissolution. We highlight that understanding the origin of stability under a real operating environment is absolutely essential for the design of a sustainable electrocatalyst with optimal balance between activity and stability.									75	2	0	0	3	0	76			2155-5435			WOS:000401054300018

Herein, a unique yolk-shell structure of Fe2O3 nanotube@hollow Co9S8 nanocage@C is rationally prepared. In a prearranged sequence, the fabrication of Fe2O3 nanotubes is followed by coating of zeolitic imidazolate framework (ZIF-67) layer, chemical etching of ZIF-67 by thioacetamide, and eventual annealing treatment. Benefiting from the hollow structures of Fe2O3 nanotubes and Co9S8 nanocages, the conductivity of carbon coating and the synergy effects between different components, the titled sample possesses abundant accessible active sites, favorable electron transfer rate, and exceptional reaction kinetics in the electrocatalysis. As a result, excellent electrocatalytic activity for alkaline OER is achieved, which delivers a low overpotential of 205 mV at the current density of 10 mA cm(-2) along with the Tafel slope of 55 mV dec(-1). Moreover, this material exhibits excellent high-rate capability and excellent cycle life when employed as anode material of LIBs. This work provides a novel approach for the design and the construction of multifunctional electrode materials for energy conversion and storage.									10	0	0	0	1	0	10			1613-6810	1613-6829		WOS:000707493300001	34655176

Along with the extensive research and development of nonprecious metal catalysts (NPMCs) to reduce/replace Pt for electrocatalytic reduction of oxygen, a new class of heteroatom-doped metal-free carbon catalysts has been recently developed, which, as alternative ORR catalysts, could dramatically reduce the cost and increase the efficiency of fuel cells and metal air batteries. The improved catalytic performance of heteroatom-doped carbon ORR catalysts has been attributed to the doping-induced charge redistribution around the heteroatom dopants, which lowered the ORR potential and changed the O-2 chemisorption mode to effectively weaken the O-O bonding, facilitating ORR at the heteroatom-doped carbon electrodes. Subsequently, this new metal-free ORR mechanism was confirmed by numerous studies, and the same principle has been applied to the development of various other efficient catalysts for not only ORR in fuel cells but also oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in metal air batteries and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in water-splitting systems. However, there are still some concerns about possible contributions of metal impurities to the ORR activities of these carbon catalysts. To avoid unnecessary confusion, therefore, it is important to clarify the situation. In this Perspective, we provide important aspects of the metal-free ORR catalysts with a critical analysis of the literature, along with perspectives and challenges of this rapidly growing field of practical significance.									410	18	0	0	17	0	412			2155-5435			WOS:000366153300024

The active sites of MOF catalysts largely exist as coordinatively unsaturated metal sites (CUMSs). In this study, facile microwave-induced plasma engraving is applied to finetune the CUMSs of cobalt-based MOF (Co-MOF-74) without destroying its phase integrity by controlling the plasma-engraving species, intensity, and duration. The electrochemical activity of the engraved MOF is found to be quantitatively correlated to the coordination geometry of the metal centers corresponding to CUMSs. Specifically, the hydrogen plasma-engraved Co-MOF-74 shows an enhanced catalytic activity of oxygen evolution reaction, which exhibits a low overpotential (337 mV at 15 mA cm(-2)), high turnover frequency (0.0219 s(-1)), and large mass activity (54.3 A g(-1)). The developed CUMS control strategy and the revealed CUMSs activity correlation can inspire the further microstructure tuning of MOFs for various applications.									33	1	0	0	1	0	33			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000500415700050	31679334	
J	Ptitsyn, G.A.								A regulatory cyclic electron transport chain in photosystem II of plants								Biophysics				43	6			948	53						Nov.-Dec. 1998	1998	The photosystem II adaptation to an abrupt decrease in the illuminance level (up to 10-5 solar constant) was studied in the Chlorella cells. The state of photosystem II was monitored by the kinetics of photosynthetic oxygen evolution induced by a series of light flashes applied at the end of the adaptation period. Under conditions of weak background illumination, the oxygen-evolving activity of photosystem II declined rapidly, most probably as a result of dark reactions. However, within 1 min of background illumination, there was a 500-fold decrease in the intensity of the dark reactions, and the activity of the photosystem II reactions began to rise. These effects can be attributed to the existence of a cyclic electron transport pathway in photosystem II, The electron transport rate along the cyclic pathway is proportional to the extent of reduction of the intersystem pool of carriers, whereas the steady-state level attained at low background illuminance is proportional to the rate of light-induced transitions in photosystem II. The quantum yield of oxygen evolution in photosystem II represents the fraction of the noncyclic electron transport. The cyclic electron transport pathways in photosystems I and II are thought to stabilize the redox state of the plastoquinone pool, thereby ensuring the maximum efficiency of proton transport.

We synthesized a highly active and durable class of electrocatalysts by exploiting the structural evolution of platinum-nickel (Pt-Ni) bimetallic nanocrystals. The starting material, crystalline PtNi3 polyhedra, transforms in solution by interior erosion into Pt3Ni nanoframes with surfaces that offer three-dimensional molecular accessibility. The edges of the Pt-rich PtNi3 polyhedra are maintained in the final Pt3Ni nanoframes. Both the interior and exterior catalytic surfaces of this open-framework structure are composed of the nanosegregated Pt-skin structure, which exhibits enhanced oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activity. The Pt3Ni nanoframe catalysts achieved a factor of 36 enhancement in mass activity and a factor of 22 enhancement in specific activity, respectively, for this reaction (relative to state-of-the-art platinum-carbon catalysts) during prolonged exposure to reaction conditions.									1990	154	0	0	141	1	2023			0036-8075	1095-9203		WOS:000333108500033	24578531

The electrode with high oxygen evolution potential has been successfully fabricated by growing TiO2 nanotubes on Ti substrate under different oxidation voltages, followed by loading with SnO2-Sb-CeO2. The morphology and composition of the electrodes were characterized by using the scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and X-ray Diffraction (XRD). Anodic oxidation voltage was investigated to find out the most appropriate TiO2-NTs substrate for the optimized electrode. Study show the obtained TiO2 nanotubes under the optimized anodic oxidation voltage of 40 V are unbroken and orderly with the length of 2.8 um and pore diameter of 80 nm. The TiO2 (40 V)/SnO2-Sb-CeO2 electrodes exhibited the highest oxygen evolution potential of 2.34 V versus saturated calomel electrode ( SCE) and has the best electrocatalytic properties. Methyl orange was used as a model pollutant to investigate the electrochemical properties. The degradation rate of the methyl orange based on the Ti/TiO2 ( 40 V)/SnO2-Sb-CeO2 electrode reach to 96%, which is about 3 times faster than that of Ti/SnO2-Sb-CeO2 electrode without using TiO2 nanotubes as the interlayer.									0	1	0	0	0	0	1			1533-4880	1533-4899		WOS:000397126500054

In this work, 2D FeSe2 nanoplatelets have been successfully synthesized via a hydrothermal reduction route, which exhibit extraordinarily high catalytic activities and stability for oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The remarkable electrocatalytic performance of FeSe2 nanoplatelets (e.g., overpotential: 2.2 times higher than that of commercial RuO2 at 500 mV; Tafel slope: 48.1 mV/dec; steady-state current densities remain constant after 70 h) can be attributed to highly exposed active sites associated with (210) crystal faces; the 2D nanostructure could also facilitate improvement of kinetics of water oxidation. Furthermore, the changes of energy level, band structure and water adsorption ability of FeSe2 under different bias were further understood based on density functional theory calculation. Therefore, this work provides the first example of FeSe2 nanoplatelets as OER application, which may open a new avenue to design and explore other Fe-based nanostructures as efficient catalysts for renewable energy.									133	6	0	0	9	0	134			2211-2855	2211-3282		WOS:000393446500011

The most promising cathode materials are nickel-rich layered oxides LiNixCoyMnzO2 (NCM) and over lithiated NCM (often called HE-NCM). Unfortunately, the full capacity of NCM cannot be utilized due to its limited cycle-life at high state-of-charge (SOC), while HE-NCM requires high voltages. By operando emission spectroscopy, we show for the first time that highly reactive singlet oxygen is released when charging NCM and HE-NCM to an SOC beyond approximate to 80%. In addition, on-line mass-spectrometry reveals the evolution of CO and CO2 once singlet oxygen is detected, providing significant evidence for the reaction between singlet oxygen and electrolyte to be a chemical reaction. It is controlled by the SOC rather than by potential, as would be the case for a purely electrochemical electrolyte oxidation. Singlet oxygen formation therefore imposes a severe challenge to the development of high-energy batteries based on layered oxide cathodes, shifting the focus of research from electrochemically stable 5 V-electrolytes to chemical stability toward singlet oxygen.									179	7	0	0	5	0	181			1369-7021	1873-4103		WOS:000447974200015

Herein, we report bimetallic metal-organic gels derived from phytic acid (PA) and mixed transition metal ions to explore their performance in electrocatalytic oxygen evolution reaction. PA is a natural phosphorus-rich organic compound, which can be obtained from plant seeds and grains. PA reacts with bimetallic ions (Fe3+ and Co2+) in a facile one-pot synthesis under mild conditions to form PA-FeCo bimetallic gels, and the corresponding aerogels are further partially reduced with NaBH4 to improve the electrocatalytic activity. Mixed valence states of Fe(II)/Fe(III) and Co(III)/Co(II) are present in the materials. Excellent OER performance in terms of overpotential (257 mV at 20 mA cm(-2)) and Tafel slope (36 mV dec(-1)) is achieved in an alkaline electrolyte. This reduction method is superior to the pyrolysis method by well maintaining the gel morphology structure. This strategy is conducive to the further improvement of the performance of metal-organic electrocatalysts, and provides guidance for the subsequent application of metal-organic gel electrocatalysts.									1	1	0	0	0	0	2			1861-4728	1861-471X		WOS:000692426600001	34411452

Herein, through a pyrolysis-oxidation process, we prepared a series of Co-Fe-Ni trimetallic oxidized carbon nanocubes (Co1-XFeXNi-OCNC) with a continuously changeable Co/Fe ratio (X=0, 0.1, 0.2, 0.5, 0.8, 0.9, 1). The Co1-XFeXNi-OCNC shows a volcano-type oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity. The optimized Co0.1Fe0.9Ni-OCNC achieves a low overpotential of 268 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) with a very low Tafel slope of 48 mV dec(-1) in 1 m KOH. At the same time, the stability of the Co0.1Fe0.9Ni-OCNC is also outstanding; after 1000 CV cycles, the LSV plot is almost coincident. Moreover, the potential remains almost of the same value at 10 mA cm(-2) after 12 h in comparison to the initial value. The excellent electrocatalytic properties can be attributed to the synergistic cooperation between each component. Therefore, the Co0.1Fe0.9Ni-OCNC is a promising candidate instead of precious metal-based electrocatalysts for OER.									7	0	0	0	0	0	7			1861-4728	1861-471X		WOS:000487091900001	31448868

In the experiments, argon gas containing 20.7% oxygen and 1.2% water vapor was fed to the anode at a rate of 47137 m//min at 600-800degreesC and an applied voltage until 3.5 V. The resulting hydrogen evolution rate reached maximally 0.67 ml/min and the hydrogen recovery rate was 60%. However, the proton transport number decreased to 0.52 because the electron-hole current increased along with protonic current according to the defect equilibrium reaction occurring under a wet atmosphere containing oxygen. During operation, the hydrogen evolution rate fluctuates over time by at least 0.1 ml/min, which is approximately 20% of the hydrogen evolution rate. Additionally, the hydrogen evolution rate increased with an increase in the partial pressure of water vapor at the anode. It is important to design the tritium monitoring system taking into consideration the fluctuation in hydrogen evolution rate.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			0022-3131			WOS:000225851800009

Herein, we report that surface reorganization engineering of nitrogen- doped MoS2 by in situ electrochemical oxidation successfully results in its significantly enhanced OER activity. In this study, the construction of the unique heterostructure MoOx@ N- doped MoS2x was performed in situ by electrochemical oxidation; based on the theoretical and experimental results, the electronic characteristics of the catalyst surface were adjusted, whereas the intrinsic properties of N- doped MoS2 were maintained. Due to the moderate amount of MoOx formed on the surface of N- doped MoS2, an optimized performance was achieved: excellent electrocatalytic activity with the very low overpotential of 270 mV at 10 mA cm2, the small Tafel slope of 61 mV dec1, and satisfactory stability. Our study provides a viable method to achieve efficient electrocatalysts via non- metal element doping and in situ electrochemical oxidation tuning, which result in the formation of the unique heterostructure of MoOx@ N- doped MoS2x in situ. This new type of core- shell heterostructure opens up a novel avenue for the rational design of high- performance OER electrocatalysts.									30	0	0	0	0	0	30			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000472183200044

The phenomenon was oxygen- and temperature-dependent, However, D1 protein degradation rate was similar in both preparations and slower than that found in non-oxygen evolving PSII particles (i.e., Mn-depleted photosystem II), These results seem to indicate that during illumination Cu(II)-inhibited samples do not behave as a typical non-oxygen evolving photosystem II, Cytochrome b(559) was functional in the presence of Cu(II). The effect of Cu(II) inhibition decreased the amount of photoreduced cytochrome b(559) and slowed down the rate of its photoreduction, The presence of Cu(II) during illumination seems to protect P680 against photodamage as occurs in photosystem II reaction centers when the acceptor side is protected, The data were consistent with the finding that production of singlet oxygen was highly reduced in the preparations treated with Cu(II). EPR. spin trapping experiments showed that inactivation of Cu(II)-treated samples was dominated by hydroxyl radical, and the loss of oxygen evolution activity was diminished by the presence of superoxide dismutase and catalase, These results indicate that the rapid loss of oxygen evolution activity in the presence of Cu(II) is mainly due to the formation of (OH)-O-. radicals from superoxide ion via a Cu(II)-catalyzed Haber-Weiss mechanism, Considering that this inactivation process was oxygen-dependent, we propose that the formation of superoxide occurs in the acceptor side of photosystem II by interaction of molecular oxygen with reduced electron acceptor species, and thus, the primarily Cu(II)inhibitory site in photosystem II is on the acceptor side.									89	1	0	0	83	4	93			0021-9258	1083-351X		WOS:A1996VQ67900038	8910320

In this study, RuO2 catalysts with controlled pore size distributions, particularly with a large number of macropores, are synthesized using a modified Adams method with silica nanosphere particles (SNPs) as a template. The specific surface areas of the prepared catalysts are 240-270 m(2) g(-1) regardless of the sizes of the SNP template. Also, all RuO2 catalysts have a rutile structure suggested from X-ray diffraction. The RuO2 catalysts with large portions of macropores (more than 20% of the total pore volume) exhibited greater OER activity and stability than the catalysts prepared using the conventional Adams method. These enhancements are attributed to fast mass transport during the reaction and the 50% increase in the electrochemically active surface area (ECSA) of the RuO2 catalysts prepared from the modified method over those prepared by the conventional Adams method. In addition, the enhanced catalytic activity (overpotential of 263 mV at 10 mA cm(-2)) of RuO2 with a large portion of macropores is revealed at the single-cell level in PEMWE.									7	0	0	0	0	0	7			1387-1811	1873-3093		WOS:000577313000004

The physical properties of the AuIr/C composite were characterized by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). Although the Au and Ir in the AuIr/C did not form alloy, it is clear that the introduction of Ir decreases the average Au particle size to 4.2 nm compared to that in the Au/C (10.1 nm). By systematical analysis on chemical state of metal surface via XPS and the electrochemical results, it was found that the Au surface for the Au/C can be activated by potential cycling from 0.12 V to 1.72 V, resulting in the increased surface roughness of Au, thus improving the ORR activity. By the same potential cycling, the Ir surface of the Ir/C was irreversibly oxidized, leading to degraded ORR activity but uninfluenced OER activity. For the AuIr/C, Ir protects Au against being oxidized due to the lower electronegativity of Ir. Combining the advantages of Au and Ir in catalyzing ORR and OER, the AuIr/C catalyst displays an enhanced catalytic activity to the ORR and a comparable OER activity. In the 50-cycle accelerated aging test for the ORR and OER, the AuIr/C displayed a satisfied stability, suggesting that the AuIr/C catalyst is a potential bifunctional catalyst for the oxygen electrode.

Herein, cubic NiCo-Prussian blue analogue (PBA)/ flower-like FeNi layered double hydroxide (LDH) heterostructure was facilely in-situ formed on porous nickel foam (NF) via hydrothermal strategy coupled by subsequent sulfurizing treatment (named as S-FeNi LDH@PBA/NF), showing largely facilitated electron transfer over homogeneous counterpart. Also, we investigated the effects of different Fe/Ni feeding ratios on their catalytic properties in some detail. The as-prepared S-FeNi LDH@PBA/NF demonstrated the superior OER activity (e.g. only 243 mV of overpotential required for 50 mA cm2) and stability. Accordingly, using the catalyst as anode, the home-assembled S-FeNi LDH@PBA/NF//Pt/C/NF electrolyzer exhibited small Tafel slope (83.1 mV dec1) and ultra-stability, showing the potential feasibility in practical water electrolysis. This strategy provides a hopeful model to enhance the OER performance by effectively constructing advanced catalyst with promising heterostructure and optimal electronic structure.

Although synthetic strategies for the employment of conductive substrates are well-established, the rational design and fabrication of hollow metal oxides nanostructures on the robust matrix with a high surface area and conductivity remains challenging. In the present research work, a strategy that transforms a metal-organic framework thin layer into a nanostructured CuO/C hollow shell to coat on the 3D nano-dendritic Cu foams as an electrode was successfully developed. This electrode is claimed to provide an extraordinary electrocatalysis for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in alkaline media. The hierarchical complex presents fast electronic transmission networks and rich redox sites, leading to the significant enhancement in electrocatalytic OER efficiency. Furthermore, the spherical porous structure and robust architecture facilitate the high-speed diffusion of O-2 bubbles in a long-term operation.

The model is based on mass, charge, energy and momentum conservation, together with a kinetic model for the redox and gas-evolving reactions. The multi-phase mixture model is used to describe the transport of oxygen in the form of gas bubbles. Numerical simulations are compared to experimental data, demonstrating good agreement. Parametric studies are performed to investigate the effects of changes in the operating temperature, electrolyte flow rate and bubble diameter on the extent of oxygen evolution. Increasing the electrolyte flow rate is found to reduce the volume of the oxygen gas evolved in the positive electrode. A larger bubble diameter is demonstrated to increase the buoyancy force exerted on the bubbles, leading to a faster slip velocity and a lower gas volume fraction. Substantial changes are observed over the range of reported bubble diameters. Increasing the operating temperature was found to increase the gas volume as a result of the enhanced rate of O-2 evolution. The charge efficiency of the cell drops markedly as a consequence.

Here, we reported an efficient synthesis of ultrathin dendritic IrTe nanotubes (NTs) via a galvanic replacement reaction using Te nanowires as the template at 190 degrees C for 1 h. The as-obtained IrTe NTs exhibited improved electrocatalytic activity and stability toward the OER with a much smaller overpotential of 290 mV and Tafel slope of 60.3 mV dec(-1) to attain a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) in acidic medium, compared with commercial IrO2 nanoparticles. Moreover, IrTe NTs also demonstrated enhanced electrocatalytic performances in neutral and alkaline media. The outstanding electrochemical properties of IrTe NTs in a wide pH range hold great promise in energy storage and conversion devices.									41	1	0	0	3	0	41			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000434625200004

Cobalt oxides with abundant oxygen vacancies (Vos) have been proved to be the promising OER electrocatalysts showing high catalytic performance. However, precisely controlling the concentration of the Vos and large-scale synthesis of these electrocatalysts are still not resolved. Herein, we propose an e-beam evaporation alloy-UV/O-3 oxidation method for fabricating optically transparent alloy oxide films (f-Ni0.1Co0.9Ox) only 10 nm thick. The concentration of the oxygen vacancies is positive correlated with the Ni content in the alloy oxides. The optimum binary Ni/Co (1/9) alloy oxide with the best defect O/lattice O ratio (0.952) exhibits ultrahigh OER mass activity of 3055 A g(-1) at 250 mV overpotential in 1.0 M KOH, almost 7.5 times and 190 times as high as CoOx and the commercial benchmark RuO2 OER catalysts, respectively. Moreover, directly depositing f-Ni0.1Co0.9Ox film on the top of the tandem-junction a-Si PV cell realizes wireless unassisted solar-driven water splitting with high solar-to-hydrogen conversion efficiency. The key roles of modulating the electron structure, stably reversible spinel structure and the reaction barrier reduction were revealed in situ spectroscopy and density functional theory calculations. This study provides a new perspective of oxygen vacancy modulation for high electrocatalysis performance via large-scale synthesis of such bimetallic alloy oxides.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000788273300002

We follow the stellar evolution from hydrogen burning till iron core collapse and simulate the explosion using a 'piston' approach. We discuss the influence of two key nuclear reaction rates, C-12(alpha, gamma)O-16 and Ne-22(alpha, n)Mg-25, on stellar evolution and nucleosynthesis. The former significantly influences the resulting core sizes (iron, silicon, oxygen) and the overall presupernova structure of the star. It thus has significant consequences for the supernova explosion itself and the compact remnant formed. The later rate considerably affects the s-process in massive stars and we demonstrate the changes that different currently suggested values for this rate cause. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

Herein, an ingenious three-dimensional hierarchical porous heterostructure that well-aligned NiFe layered double hydroxide nanosheets deposited on NiFe nanoparticles and rooted tightly into carbonized wood framework (NiFe-LDHs@NiFe/CW) is developed, and the resultant electrocatalysts perfectly retains the characteristic structure of wood and forms a heterostructure. Benefitting from the abundant hetero-interfaces, optimized electronic configuration, and hierarchical pores, the NiFe-LDHs@NiFe/CW has remarkable electrocatalytic activity and stability toward OER, which possesses a low overpotential of 212 mV at 50 mA cm-2 and insignificant potential increase (approximate to 4.0%) at 50 mA cm-2 for 100 h. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations further reveal that the heterostructures can optimize the electronic structure and have the lowest adsorption energy, thus accelerating the catalytic kinetics. The strategy reported may benefit particularly to utilizing natural and renewable resources to design high-performance electrocatalysts.									10	0	0	0	1	0	10			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000664193500001

The nanohybrids are obtained through a facile self-assemble process of transition metal layered double hydroxide (TMLDH) on MXene surface; followed by a low temperature in situ solid-state reaction step. By tuning the Ni:Fe ratio, the as-synthesized NFPS@MXene nanohybrids exhibit excellent activities when tested as electrocatalysts for overall water splitting. Particularly, with the initial Ni:Fe ratio of 7:3, the obtained Ni0.7Fe0.3PS3@MXene nanohybrid reveals low overpotential (282 mV) and Tafel slope (36.5 mV dec(-1)) for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in 1 m KOH solution. Meanwhile, the Ni0.9Fe0.1PS3@MXene shows low overpotential (196 mV) for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in 1 m KOH solution. When integrated for overall water splitting, the Ni0.7Fe0.3PS3@MXene parallel to Ni0.9Fe0.1PS3@MXene couple shows a low onset potential of 1.42 V and needs only 1.65 V to reach a current density of 10 mA cm(-2), which is better than the all noble metal IrO2 parallel to Pt/C electrocatalyst (1.71 mV@10 mA cm(-2)). Given the chemical versatility of Ni1-xFexPS3 and the convenient self-assemble process, the nanohybrids demonstrated in this work are promising for energy conversion applications.									141	7	0	0	7	0	141			1614-6832	1614-6840		WOS:000444537800005

Herein, we report a new use of conventional Co doped ZnO nanorods with a band gap of 1.77 eV as a noble-metal-free photocatalyst for OER under visible light illumination. A remarkable performance of ca. 191.8 mu mol/h is realized by 50 mg of the optimal Co doped ZnO photocatalyst and visible light illumination (>420 nm). The apparent quantum yields are ca. 22.8 % and 43.5 % at the wavelength of 420 nm and 380 nm, respectively. This research suggests the potential of this conventional material to hardness sunlight for efficient water splitting and other advanced photocatalytic applications.									13	0	0	0	0	0	13			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000706857300005

Herein, we provide the novel design and synthesis of an advanced category of CeO2/ CoS2 heterostructures, which combines the local photothermal effect (LPTE) action of CeO2 and the pho-toelectric effect CoS2 to boost OER. Interestingly, the hollow framework, rich heterointerface, coupled local photothermal effect and photoelectric effect equip CeO2/CoS(2 )with remarkably excellent electrocatalytic OER performance. As a result, the optimized CeO2/CoS2-6 only needs an overpotential of 283 mV to reach 10 mA cm(-2) as well as a smaller Tafel slop of 33.2 mV dec(-1), outperforming the RuO2 catalyst (323 mA @ 10 mA cm(-2)). Upon combination of experimental data and mechanistic study, it is revealed that the enhanced OER performance is primarily ascribed to the photo-induced local thermal. partly resulting from photoelectric effect, where the photogenerated electron flow from CeO2 to CoS2 can photogenerated holes in CeO2 to boost water oxidation. This work is extremely expected to offer a novel avenue for the rational design and fabrication of outstanding OER electrocatalysts upon LPTE. (c) 2022 Elsevier Inc.

The successful formation of the triazine polymer was confirmed by Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy, C-13, and N-15 cross-polarization magic angle spinning solid-state NMR. The two-dimensional layered architecture and graphitic nature of the samples resembled that of nitrogen-doped amorphous carbon, as confirmed by Raman, powder X-ray diffraction, and transmission electron microscopy measurements. The catalytic activity of these materials toward nitrophenol reduction and electrocatalytic activity toward oxygen evolution reaction (OER) were systematically evaluated in detail. Electrocatalytic activity toward oxygen evolution reaction was systematically evaluated by chronoamperometry and linear sweep voltammetry. Results clearly demonstrate that all of these catalysts exhibit good OER activity and excellent stability. Among all catalysts, EPOP-700 showed better OER activity, as reflected by its onset potential and current density, comparable with that of the metal-based OER catalysts and better than that of metal-free catalysts. Further, their catalytic activity toward the reduction of 4-nitrophenol to 4-aminophenol was tested with NaBH4; although all of these catalysts showed good catalytic activity; EPOP-800 displayed better catalytic activity.									24	1	0	0	8	0	25			2470-1343			WOS:000436340500037	31458807

The effect of the progressive replacement of Sb with Ru (x = 0.00; 3.25; 6.50; 13.00 at.%) on their electrochemical response in acid medium has been analysed by cyclic voltammetry. The morphology of the coatings was observed by scanning electron microscopy. Ti/SnO2-Sb-Pt electrodes without Ru presented a cracked-mud structure, typical of oxide electrodes prepared by thermal decomposition. The introduction of Ru in the oxide layer modified the coating morphology. The roughness increased and passed through a maximum with the increase of Ru content. A relation between the surface morphology, the roughness factor, voltammetric charge and the electrochemical activity has been established. The mechanism and electrocatalytic activity towards the oxygen evolution reaction has been studied from Tafel measurements. The progressive introduction of Ru in the electrodes increased their electrocatalytic activity for the oxygen evolution reaction with a change on the mechanism from non-active to active electrodes. The electrocatalytic activity mainly depends on electronic factors. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

However, the sluggish kinetics of hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and especially oxygen evolution reaction (OER) hinder the water splitting efficiency. Meanwhile, the high-cost of noble-metal catalysts limit their actual application. It is thus highly urgent to exploit an economical and earth-abundant bifunctional HER and OER electrocatalyst to simplify procedure and reduce cost. Herein, we synthesize the three-dimensionally ordered macro-/mesoporous (3DOM/m) NixCo100-x, alloys with distinctive structure and large surface area via a dual-templating technique. Among them, the 3DOM/m Ni61Co39 shows the lowest overpotentials of 121 mV and 241 mV at 10 mA/cm(2) for HER and OER, respectively. Furthermore, when employed for water splitting, the Ni61Co39 only requires 1.60 V to approach 10 mA/cm(2) and presents excellent stability. These encouraging performances of the Ni61Co39 render it a promising bifunctional catalyst for overall water splitting.

Here, an ionic MOF (Ni-btz) constructed with an azolate ligand is selected, and continuous 3D bimetallic MOF (NiFe-btz) films deriving from high-degree intergrowth of microsized MOFs particles are fabricated. The as-prepared NiFe-btz/NF-OH electrode exhibits excellent OER performance with a low overpotential of 239 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) under alkaline condition. The OER charge transfer process and bimetallic coupling effect in ionic NiFe-btz are probed by density functional theory calculations and confirmed via X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and in situ Raman measurements. The partial density of states of NiFe-btz indicates that the main contribution for electron density around the Fermi level is from Cl ions clarifying the profitable impact of ionic MOF framework. This work systematically demonstrates the relationship of electronic structure and OER activity in ionic, bimetallic MOFs and expands the scope of 3D MOF films for efficient OER.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0				2198-3844		WOS:000848445700001	36050878

Graphene not only improves the charge transfer efficiency of the compound material but also provides confined growth sites for PBA. Furthermore, the charge transfer interaction between the heterostructure interfaces facilitates the electrocatalytic oxygen evolution reaction of the composite, which is confirmed by the results of the electrochemical measurements. The overpotential of the PBA/rGO material is only 331.5 mV at a current density of 30 mA cm(-2) in 1.0 M KOH electrolyte with a small Tafel slope of 57.9 mV dec(-1), and the compound material exhibits high durability lasting for 40 h.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0				1420-3049		WOS:000851741100001	36080240

In this work, NiO/RuO2 heterojunction nano-sheets in situ grown on nickel foam (NiO/RuO2/NF) is successfully prepared, which shows good activity and stability for both oxygen and hydrogen evolution reaction (OER and HER). For overall water splitting (OWS), it only needs 1.44 V to obtain 10 mA cm-2 in 1.0 M KOH solution. Notably, it can work for 72 h at +/- 1,500 mA cm-2 toward OER, HER and OWS with small activity decrease. Under simulated industrial conditions, 1.90 V is needed to drive 1,500 mA cm-2, and it also can work steadily for 72 h. The reason could be attributed to the heterogeneous interface coupling effect and nano-sheets with rough surface directly grown on NF. Hence, this work provides a feasible strategy for developing robust bifunctional Ru based water splitting catalysts.									11	0	0	0	1	0	10			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000740950400001		
J	Li, Mian; Liu, Tingting; Fan, Liquan; Bo, Xiangjie; Guo, Liping								Three-dimensional hierarchical meso/macroporous Fe/Co-nitrogen-doped carbon encapsulated FeCo alloy nanoparticles prepared without any template or surfactant: High-performance bifunctional oxygen electrodes								JOURNAL OF ALLOYS AND COMPOUNDS				686				467	478		10.1016/j.jallcom.2016.06.060				NOV 25 2016	2016	Exploring highly efficient bi-functional electro-catalysts toward oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) are critical for developing energy conversion and storage systems. Herein, for the first time, without any template or surfactant, a family of Fe/Co-N-doped three-dimensional (3D) hierarchical meso/macroporous carbon encapsulated FeCo nanoparticles (denoted as FexCo(1-x)-N/PC) have been successfully synthesized through pyrolyzing the low-cost biomass-based precursors in the NH3 atmosphere. After optimizing the molar ratio of Fe/Co, benefiting from the collaborative advantages of the Fe/Co-N-C species, cobalt-based electro-active phases, and unique 3D electrode configuration, the resultant Fe0.5Co0.5-N/PC amazingly shows considerable ORR activity comparable with commercial Pt/C catalyst via a 4e(-) pathway in alkaline electrolyte. When used for OER catalysis in an alkaline medium, Fe0.5Co0.5-N/PC achieves an extremely negative potential of 1.625 V vs. RHE at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) and a low Tafel slope of 68.3 mV dec(-1). Furthermore, the overpotential (Delta E) between ORR and OER is just 0.813 V, which is nearly the minimum value for the non-precious metal catalysts. We believe that our present synthetic strategy can be further extended to develop other 3D hierarchical meso/macroporous carbonaceous catalysts for various applications, such as sensors, batteries, and supercapacitors.

The impact of pulse parameters including pulse duration and duty cycle on the surface morphology, phase composition, and electrochemical performance of Ti/Sn-SbOX/beta-PbO2 electrodes was systematically investigated. The electrochemical measurements and accelerated life tests suggested that the composite electrode prepared with a pulse duration of 300 ms exhibited the lowest oxygen evolution potential and longest service life. The crystal size of the PbO2 active layer along the (110), (101), and (211) planes decreased after decreasing the duty cycle. As a result, the PbO2 layer obtained under a pulse duration of 300 ms and 10% duty cycle displayed a small, dense, and uniform crystal size distribution. The oxygen evolution potential was 0.365 V lower than that of the electrode obtained under direct current model, and the accelerated life was increased by 24.4 h. These results provide a promising deposition method for the preparation of composite anode materials in zinc electrowinning.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0947-7047	1862-0760		WOS:000791651200002

We report a scanning electrochemical cell microscopy (SECCM) investigation of zeolitic imidazolate framework (ZIF-67)-derived Co-N-doped C composite particles with respect to the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Surmounting the surface wetting issues as well as the potential drift through the use of a non-interfering Os complex as free-diffusing internal redox potential standard, SECCM could be successfully applied in alkaline media. SECCM mapping reveals activity differences relative to the number of particles in the wetted area of the droplet landing zone. The turnover frequency (TOF) is 0.25 to 1.5 s(-1) at potentials between 1.7 and 1.8 V vs. RHE, respectively, based on the number of Co atoms in each particle. Consistent values at locations with varying number of particles demonstrates OER performance devoid of macroscopic film effects.									44	0	0	0	3	0	44			1433-7851	1521-3773		WOS:000482404000001	31347751

Charge percolation through the hydrous layer has been quantified, using cyclic voltammetry, in terms of a charge transport diffusion coefficient D(CT) which admits a value of ca. 3 x 10(-10) cm(2) s(-1). Steady-state Tafel plot analysis and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy have been used to elucidate the kinetics and mechanism of oxygen evolution. Tafel slope values of ca. 60 mV dec (1) and ca. 120 mV dec (1) are found at low and high overpotentials respectively, whereas the reaction order with respect to hydroxide ion activity changes from ca. 3/2 to ca. 1 as the potential is increased. These observations are rationalised in terms of a kinetic scheme involving Temkin adsorption and the rate determining formation of a physisorbed hydrogen peroxide intermediate on the oxide surface. The dual Tafel slope behaviour is ascribed to the potential dependence of the surface coverage of adsorbed intermediates.									73	0	0	0	3	0	74			1463-9076			WOS:000264374700008	19305893

In this communication, we report the development of homologous Co-based nanowire films, Co2N nanowire film on a Ti mesh (Co2N/TM) and Co-phosphate nanowire film on a Ti mesh (Co-Pi/TM), as complementary catalysts for stable electrochemical hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in neutral electrolyte. Co2N/TM shows remarkable HER activity with the need of an overpotential of 290 mV to drive 10 mA cm(-2) in 1.0 M phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and Co-Pi/TM is superior in OER activity affording 10 mA cm(-2) at overpotentials of only 430 and 300 mV in 0.1 and 1.0 M PBS, respectively. The two-electrode water electrolyzer using Co2N/TM as a cathode and Co-Pi/TM as an anode affords a water-splitting current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at a cell voltage of 1.78 V with 100% Faradaic efficiency in 1.0 M PBS, promising the practical uses of such homologous Co-based catalyst materials in technological devices.									34	3	0	0	1	0	35			2044-4753	2044-4761		WOS:000404887400003

Herein, a high-performance MnOx/hCNC cathode was constructed by the defect-induced deposition of manganese oxide (MnOx) nanoparticles on hierarchical carbon nanocages (hCNC). The corresponding Li-O-2 battery (MnOx/hCNC@Li-O-2) exhibited excellent electrocatalytic activity with the low overpotential of 0.73-0.99 V in the current density range of 0.1-1.0 A center dot g(-1). The full discharge capacity and cycling life of MnOx/hCNC@Li-O-2 were increased by similar to 86.7% and similar to 91%, respectively, compared with the hCNC@Li-O-2 counterpart. The superior performance of MnOx/hCNC cathode was ascribed to (i) the highly dispersed MnOx nanoparticles for boosting the reversibility of oxygen evolution/reduction reactions, (ii) the interconnecting pore structure for increasing Li2O2 accommodation and facilitating charge/mass transfer, and (iii) the concealed surface defects of hCNC for suppressing side reactions. This study demonstrated an effective strategy to improve the performance of Li-O-2 batteries by constructing cathodes with highly dispersed catalytic sites and hierarchical porous structure.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1998-0124	1998-0000		WOS:000762139500002

The catalytic performance of electrocatalysts can be enhanced through the increasement of intrinsic catalytic activity by optimizing electronic structure and the improvement of exposed active sites by designing proper nanostructures. In this work, CoS2@MoS2@NiS2 nano polyhedron with double-shelled structure was prepared using metal organic framework as a precursor. Due to the rational integration of multifunctional active center, the strong electronic interaction of the various component, the high electrochemical surface area and shortened mass transport induced by the special structure, CoS2@MoS2@NiS2 exhibits high catalytic activity for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). Specifically, low overpotentials of 156 and 200 mV was achieved to deliver a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) for HER and OER, and a high half-wave potential of 0.80 V was observed for ORR. More importantly, the Zn-air battery assembled by CoS2@MoS2@NiS2 exhibits a high-power density of 80.28 mW cm(-2) and could effectively drive overall water splitting.

Transition metal chalcogenides, especially those based on Co and Ni, are emerging as promising OER catalysts, thanks to their high activity and low cost. However, it is still being debated whether they act as actual catalysts or as catalyst precursors, undergoing structural and morphological changes under OER conditions. To gain a better comprehension of this topic, we have developed a simple colloidal synthesis method for alloy nanocrystals (NCs) based on Ni, Co, S, and Se with a tunable composition, and we studied their structural and morphological evolution during OER. We found that binary CoSe, ternary Ni-Co-Se and quaternary Ni-Co-S-Se NCs, with the exception of NiSe, each undergo structural and morphological changes under OER conditions, forming the corresponding metal oxides/hydroxides, which act as the actual active catalysts. Interestingly, we discovered that the composition of the starting metal chalcogenide NCs plays a major role in dictating the crystallinity, conductivity and activity of such oxide/hydroxide materials. This compositional tuning, that is going from CoSe to Ni0.25Co0.65SO4Se0.6 NCs, resulted in a similar to 7 fold improvement in the OER activity in terms of turnover frequency. Our results suggest that the compositional engineering of metal chalcogenide materials could potentially be used to control their inevitable transformation into the corresponding oxide/hydroxide counterparts, eventually improving their OER activity.									18	0	0	0	1	0	18			2574-0970			WOS:000461401100044

A detailed analysis via electron microscopy in combination with EDS elemental mapping conclusively verifies that the reactive oxygen species generated from the plasma-assisted decomposition of water molecules govern the phase structure of the nanocrystals. Under oxidizing conditions, the Co oxide, which is more stable than the Ag oxide, provides the driving force for the segregation and preferential oxidation of Co at the surface. This leads to the formation of the core-shell architecture. The electrochemical measurements for the oxygen reduction reaction reveal that the specific activities of the Ag@Co3O4 core-shell nanocrystals are ca. 5.2 and 2.6 times higher than those of the pure Ag and Ag-Co alloy nanocrystals. The enhanced catalytic performance is attributed to the combination of electronic and geometric effects, which facilitates the O-O bond breaking and desorption for the oxygen reduction. The insights gain through this study may serve as a foundation to design better electrochemical oxygen reduction electrocatalysts. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Tailoring the electrocatalysts through nano- and composition engineering is an effective strategy to enhance the intrinsic and extrinsic electrocatalytic activities. In this study, for the first time, sodium-nickel pyrophosphate (Na2NiP2O7) is proposed as a novel OER electrocatalyst in alkaline environment. First, the electrocatalytic performance of micron-sized Na2NiP2O7 (Na2NiP2O7-micron) is evaluated. In addition, nanoscale Na2NiP2O7 (Na2NiP2O7-nano) and Fe-substituted Na2NiP2O7-nano (Na2Ni1-xFexP2O7-nano) are synthesized to improve the electrocatalytic performance of Na2NiP2O7. Although Na2NiP2O7-micron exhibits low electrocatalytic OER activity in alkaline medium, its catalytic activity can be significantly improved through reducing the particle size and substituting Fe in the Ni sites. The synthesized Na2Ni0.75Fe0.25P2O7-nano exhibits optimal catalytic activity with an overpotential of 300 mV at a current density of 10 mA/cm(2) and long-term durability with continuous O-2 generation over 100 hours in alkaline medium.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			0002-7820	1551-2916		WOS:000532828600001

In this study, 3-D Ni3S2@Co(OH)(2) nanowires with core-shell structure, which are directly fabricated on nickel (Ni) foam, are developed as a bifunctional catalyst for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). In such a coreshell structure, the ultrathin alpha-Co(OH)(2) layer of nanosheets (shell) are uniformly wrapped around the Ni3S2 nanowires (core). It is found that the obtained 3-D Ni3S2@Co(OH)(2) nanowires could provide large electrochemical surface areas for the electrocatalytic reactions, and further resulted in enhanced electrocatalytic performance. The as-prepared catalyst exhibits a low onset potential and low resistance of charge transfer as well as excellent stability towards the HER. In terms of the onset potential and stability towards the OER, it is observed that theNi(3)S(2)@Co(OH)(2) is comparable to that of the RuO2. Due to its well-defined bifunctionality, it is found that an as-prepared water electrolyzer with Ni3S2@Co(OH)(2) as a bifunctional catalyst for HER and OER could deliver a constant cell voltage of 1.64 V at the current density of 10 mA cm(-2) for 100 h.									39	1	0	0	2	0	39			0378-7753	1873-2755		WOS:000503098200016

However, the poor electrical conductivity and insufficient active sites limited their development in various fields. Herein, we report the method of phosphorous-doped NiCo2O4 (named as P-NCO) prepared by the two-step strategy: the NiCo2O4 nanostructure is grown on the nickel foams by hydrothermal treatment and subsequently phosphatized in a tube furnace. Successfully, the rich oxygen vacancies and the P element introduced into the NiCo2O4 structure obviously improve the electrical conductivity, and the resulting P-NCO NWs/NF material shows an ultrahigh specific capacitance of 2747.8 F g(-1) at 1 A g(-1) and a prominent rate performance (maintain 50% at 100 A g(-1)). Furthermore, the assembled P-NCO NWs/NF//RGO asymmetric supercapacitor has an energy density of 28.2 W h kg(-1) even at a high power density of 7750.35 W kg(-1). After 10,000 cycles, the capacitance still also has an 88.48% retention rate. As an electrocatalyst, P-NCO NWs/NF has an excellent hydrogen evolution reaction (55 mV at 10 mA cm(-2)) and oxygen evolution reaction (300 mV at 10 mA cm(-2)) activities in 1 M KOH solution.

Furthermore, hierarchical structures are widely used in heterogeneous catalysis in various catalytic processes. A novel hybrid of Mo-doped Ni3Fe/Ni3FeN nanocatalyst was designed by using a facile method in this study. The Mo-Ni3Fe/Ni3FeN catalyst exhibits an outstanding catalytic performance for oxygen evolution reaction, as indicated by an ultralow overpotential of 240 mV at 10 mA.cm(-2) and a small Tafel slope of 47 mV.dec(-1).

The fabricated hierarchically structured Ni-BDC@NiS as a synergistic electrocatalyst shows extremely high activity toward the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The optimal Ni-BDC@NiS catalyst acquires a current density of 20 mA cm(-2) at a lower overpotential of 330 mV and low Tafel slope of 62 mV dec(-1), outperforming most previously reported Ni-based sulfide catalysts. Clearly, the combination of the NiS and Ni-BDC array contributed to the improvement of electron transfer, promotion of water adsorption, and increase of rich active species. In addition, the in situ created hierarchical structure not only affords feasible access for mass transport but also strengthens structural integrity, contributing to efficient and stable OER performance. This general and effective strategy anchoring conductive active species on a porous metal-organic framework (MOF) thus provides an efficient way to fabricate synergistic electrocatalysts for the OER.									51	3	0	0	3	0	53			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000495769900065	31603301

First, we review our results on ultra-thin film catalysts and compare them to other systems, emphasizing methods that provide accurate intrinsic catalyst activities. We then discuss reports that catalysts with the highest OER activities (in base) often undergo structural and chemical changes during the OER. These findings have implications on how OER catalysts are studied and designed. We suggest opportunities to control molecular-scale interactions in hydrous layered hydroxide/oxyhydroxide catalysts as well as the control of three-dimensional nano- and microstructures using templating approaches.

In this study, Ni-Fe nanosheets were first created by electrochemical deposition method and then Mo-doped Ni-Fe nanosheets were created by hydrothermal electrode method. Then, electrode performance was investigated as electrocatalyst of HFR and OFR reactions. Morphology and microstructure of the electrodes were investigated using Field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) and electrocatalytic activity was evaluated using LSV, Tafel test and EIS methods. The results of this study showed that among Ni-Fe electrodes sample, M-20 had the best electrocatalytic properties as well as molybdenum-doped electrode due to high surface area and also the synergistic effect of molybdenum doping showed better electrocatalytic behavior. In which, to generate a current density of 10 mA.cm(-2) for the HER and OER, it required the 84 and 225 mV overpotentials, respectively. The electrode was also used as a bifunctional electrode for overall water splitting, which required a voltage of 1.81 V to generate a current density of 100 mA.cm(-2). This study introduces an economical and effective method for the synthesis of electrocatalysts with appropriate activity.

However, the less accessible active sites and poor stability of MOFs hinder their potential practical applications. Hierarchical double-layer hydroxide (LDH)/MOF electrocatalysts that combine the advantages of two materials are expected to overcome these drawbacks. Herein, we develop a simple and universal strategy,in situpseudomorphic transformation, to construct hierarchical LDH/MOF electrocatalysts. Accordingly, ultra-thin Fe-Ni LDH nanosheets arein situproduced in the heterometallic MOF during the transformation process. Profiting from the abundant metal sites and the extended electron transport channel from the inserted ultra-thin LDH arrays, the hierarchical Fe-Ni LDH/MOFs exhibit striking electrochemical activities for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). In particular, the as-synthesized Fe-Ni LDH/MOF-b2 delivers the best OER performance, exhibiting an ultralow overpotential (255 mV at 10 mA cm(-2)), minimum Tafel slope (24 mV dec(-1)) and outstanding cycling durability. Meanwhile, the evolution process of the hierarchical Fe-Ni LDH/MOF has been monitored with the controllablein situsemi-transformation strategy. This also provides an opportunity to decipher the original active species for the OER process. Mechanism analysis indicates that the bimetallic MOF and bimetallic LDH are both active species, and the excellent OER performance of hierarchical Fe-Ni LDH/MOF could be attributed to the effect of "a whole greater than the sum of the parts".									46	1	0	0	1	0	47			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000549588900011	32614012	
J	Qian Duan								Study on Electrochemical Oxygen Evolution Properties of Bimetallic Carbon Nan Sheets								Key Engineering Materials				871				306	11		10.4028/www.scientific.net/KEM.871.306				2021	2021	Transition metal oxide doped two-dimensional materials, which combine the advantages of multiphase and homogeneous electrocatalysts, have attracted extensive attention in recent years. However, the electrocatalysts with single metal component can not further meet the requirements of catalytic performance. In this paper, a bimetallic organic complex, CuCo-MOF, was prepared from L-aspartic acid and copper ions and cobalt ions. The effects of temperature and metal ratio on the oxygen evolution properties of the prepared materials were investigated, and CN@CuO/Co2O3 nanosheets with excellent oxygen evolution electrochemical activity were optimized. The catalyst is a compound of CuO and Co2O3 nanoparticles doped into the carbon nitrogen matrix. A large number of homogeneous CuO and Co2O3 nanoparticles cooperate on the ultra-thin carbon nitrogen substrate with high conductivity, showing low initial oxygen evolution over potential and high catalytic current density. A current density of 10 mA cm-2 can be only achieved at 1.54 V vs. RHE.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1013-9826			INSPEC:21044738

However, perovskite-based catalysts still have limitations in performances due to their low surface area and electrical conductivity. Herein, double perovskite (NdBa0.5Sr0.5Co1.5Fe0.5O5+delta, NBSCF) is synthesized and embedded into porous, hollow nanostructured Co3O4, showing excellent activity for OER. Synergistic effect between hollow-net Co3O4 and NBSCF is demonstrated by considerably increased BET surface area (1.2/65.1 m(2).g(-1)) and high ratio of multivalent Co oxidation state (Co3+/Co2+ and Co3+/Co4+), leading to high performance of Co3O4/NBSCF for OER and ORR. Furthermore, hybridization of Co3O4/NBSCF compound in 3D architectures with conductive polyaniline and N-doped carbon nanotube/reduced graphene oxides (NCNT/NrGO) further boosts oxygen electrode activity (0.80 V) in alkaline media because of improved electrical conductivity and mass transport of oxygen species. In particular, NCNT/NrGO-Co3O4/NBSCF-PANI (NNCNP) hybrid catalysts show 0.80 V at near half-wave potential (-3 mA.cm(-2)) and 1.60 V at 10 mA.cm(-2) for ORR and OER, respectively, indicating excellent intrinsic OER/ORR kinetics of NNCNP. In addition, after 1,000th voltammetric cycle testing for OER and 10,000th cycle testing for ORR, the least performance decay is observed among synthesized catalysts, demonstrating that NNCNP is an efficient bifunctional electrocatalyst for overall water splitting.

Herein, we construct a unique three-dimensional (3D) porous electrocatalyst with hollow (Co,Fe)P nanoframes encapsulated into N,P-codoped graphene aerogel (CFP NFs@NPGA) through one-step in situ encapsulation and selective etching, followed by phosphorization. Due to its uniqure 3D porous nanoarchitecture, CFP NFs@NPGA displays superior electrocatalytic performance. As a highly efficient catalyst for hydrogen evolution reaction, the CFP NFs@NPGA catalyst only needs low overpotential of 155 mV to afford 10 mA cm(-2) under alkaline condition. Meanwhile, the hybrid reveals remarkable oxygen revolution reaction activity with a small overpotential of 278 mV to afford 10 mA cm(-2) in alkaline electrolyte. When adopted as both cathode and anode in overall water-splitting cell, the hybrid requires only 1.59 V to achieve 10 mA cm(-2) with nearly 100% faradaic efficiency, and the experimentally measured H-2 and O-2 gas genenaration rates are about 0.18 and 0.09 mmol h(-1), respectively, showing outstanding long-term stability even over 48 h. The present results manifest that the combination of hollow nanostructure and hetem-atom-doped carbon matrix is an effective strategy to enhance water-splitting performance of transition metal phosphides.									30	4	0	0	1	0	30			0378-7753	1873-2755		WOS:000523640600008

Developing a high-efficient and durable electrocatalyst is a critical material for water electrolysis. Therefore, we synthesize a series of iron-doped metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) by a facile one-pot hydrothermal method. In the conventional three electrode-cell, the Co/Fe (1:1)-MOF catalyst exhibits an overpotential of 317 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) in the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Furthermore, the electrolysis performance of Co/Fe (1:1)-MOF catalyst is further evaluated in a home-made anion-exchange-membrane water electrolysis cell. With the Co/Fe (1:1)-MOF as the OER catalyst and commercial Pt/C as the hydrogen-evolution-reaction catalyst, the cell presents an overpotential of 490 mV at a large current density of 500 mA cm(-2), which is superior to the benchmark cell with commercial IrO2 as the OER catalyst in the alkaline media. Theoretical calculation demonstrates that the introduction of Fe dopant into MOFs significantly reduces the binding energy of *O and *OOH intermedium during the OER progress. Consequently, the electrocatalytic activity is increased, which is perfectly consistent with the experimental results. This work suggests that the iron-doped MOFs structure significantly improves the electrocatalytic activity and provides a facile strategy to produce hydrogen at a large current density for industrial water electrolysis.

However, there are a lack of insightful studies of electrocatalyst performance in nanoflower MnO2. This study assesses the electrocatalytic performances of nanoflower structure MnO(2)for both oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in a zinc-air battery as a bifunctional electrocatalyst. The prepared catalyst was characterized in term of morphology, crystallinity, and total surface area. Cyclic voltammetry and linear sweep voltammetry were used to evaluate the electrochemical behaviors of the as-prepared nanoflower-like MnO2. The discharge performance test for zinc-air battery with a MnO(2)catalyst was also conducted. The results show that the MnO(2)prepared at dwell times of 2, 4 and 6 h were nanoflowers, nanoflower mixed with nanowires, and nanowires with corresponding specific surface areas of 52.4, 34.9 and 32.4 g/cm(2), respectively. The nanoflower-like MnO(2)catalyst exhibits a better electrocatalytic performance towards both ORR and OER compared to the nanowires. The number of electrons transferred for the MnO(2)with nanoflower, nanoflower mixed with nanowires, and nanowire structures is 3.68, 3.31 and 3.00, respectively. The as-prepared MnO(2)nanoflower-like structure exhibits the best discharge performance of 31% higher than the nanowires and reaches up to 30% of the theoretical discharge capacity of the zinc-air battery.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5				2073-4344		WOS:000564857400001

In this report, we use chip-based electrochemistry mass spectrometry with O-18 isotope-labeled oxides Pt and Ir to in-vestigate the involvement of lattice oxygen in the electrochemical oxidation of water (the oxygen evo-lution reaction, OER), adventitious carbon, and CO. For Pt, we find that the labeled oxygen from (PtOx)-O-18 incorporated into the CO2 resulting from CO oxidation at the potential at which oxygen at the elec-trode surface is reduced to hydroxyl (*OH ), confirming that *OH is the reactive species in the Langmuir-Hinshelwood electrochemical oxidation of CO. For Ir we find that lattice oxygen in (IrO2)-O-18 is similarly involved in electrochemical CO oxidation, but only if it is first activated by a reductive sweep. The la-beled CO2 signal is transient, indicating that activated lattice oxygen provides the "ignition sites" for the Langmuir-Hinshelwood electrochemical oxidation of CO on Ir. We also confirm the previously reported result that electrochemically prepared, amorphous, (IrOx)-O-18 incorporates much more lattice oxygen in O-2 evolved during OER than does rutile Ir18O2, but we also quantify the amount and show that in all cases the labeled O-2 is a very small portion of the total O-2 evolved, and that more lattice oxygen is released CO2 when oxidizing CO and adventitious carbon than is released in O-2 when oxidizing water. Through these results, we demonstrate that EC-MS in concert with isotope labeling and CO as a probe molecule can provide insight into lattice oxygen reactivity, extending the utility of CO oxidation to the study of noble metal oxides used in e.g. PEM electrolyzer anodes.

Herein, phosphorus (P)-doped NiS2 hierarchical architectures with sulfur vacancies are synthesized via a Prussian-blue-analogue-sacrificed strategy followed by a phosphidation process. By modulation of P doping and sulfur vacancies, the optimal catalyst manifests outstanding electrocatalytic activities, affording low overpotentials of 73 mV at 10 mA cm-2 for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), and 255 mV at 20 mA cm-2 for oxygen evolution reaction (OER), respectively. Density functional theory calculations certify that the P dopant not only serves as the new active sites, but also activates the electrochemical activity of neighboring Ni and S sites. Moreover, the synergistic effect of P-doping and sulfur vacancies further improve electrochemical activities of HER and OER by optimizing the adsorption free energy of hydrogen (Delta GH*) and oxygen-containing intermediates (OH*, O* and OOH*), respectively. This finding provides a directive strategy to achieve efficient non-noble metal catalysts for energy conversion and storage.									26	0	0	0	1	0	26			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000664254400005

Groups of divergently related enzymes whose members catalyze different reactions but share a common partial reaction, intermediate, or transition state (mechanistically diverse superfamilies) have been discovered, including the enolase, amidohydrolase, thiyl radical, crotonase, vicinal-oxygen-chelate, and Fe-dependent oxidase superfamilies. Other groups of divergently related enzymes whose members catalyze different overall reactions that do not share a common mechanistic strategy (functionally distinct suprafamilies) have also been identified: (a) functionally distinct suprafamilies whose members catalyze successive transformations in the tryptophan and histidine biosynthetic pathways and (b) functionally distinct suprafamilies whose members catalyze different reactions in different metabolic pathways. An understanding of the structural bases for the catalytic diversity observed in super- and suprafamilies may provide the basis for discovering the functions of proteins and enzymes in new genomes as well as provide guidance for in vitro evolution/engineering of new enzymes.									407	2	0	0	361	0	415			0066-4154	1545-4509		WOS:000170012100007	11395407

Numerous single-atom catalysts (SACs) have achieved satisfactory performances in this area; however, non-carbon metal-free substrates have been rarely explored. Herein, we report a series of single-metal atoms supported on a novel two-dimensional NP monolayer as promising electrocatalysts for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) by theoretical calculations. Our results disclose that Ti@NP, V@NP and Ir@NP exhibit desirable catalytic activity for the HER with extremely low of -0.004, -0.051, and 0.017 eV, respectively. More importantly, the calculated activation barriers for the Tafel reactions of these SACs are much lower than those for the benchmark Pt catalysts. In addition, Pt@NP shows the lowest eta(OER) of 0.495 V, followed by Rh@NP (eta(OER) = 0.548 V), which are even superior to that of state-of-the-art IrO2. This work highlights the potential application of metal-free supports in SACs, which also further enriches the application of a NP monolayer in other related electrochemical processes.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			1463-9076	1463-9084		WOS:000784886100001	35438086

The obtained FeP@FePNCs exhibited outstanding catalytic activity and durability towards the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in alkaline media. Moreover, the FeP@FePNCs also displayed high-performance in acidic media. The remarkable ORR activity originates from the synergetic effects between the embedded FeP nanoparticles and the heteroatom-doped carbon structures. Moreover, the porous structure, high specific surface area, and electron conductivity can contribute to enhance the ORR performance.									17	3	0	0	2	0	17			2046-2069			WOS:000400157700030

However, such process is plagued by the use of high-cost precious metal-based catalysts (such as Pt, RuO2). Hereby, the use of a low-cost Nitrogen and Sulfur co-doped carbon-supported cobalt sulfide dual-functional electrocatalyst derived from imidazole modified lignin for overall water splitting is presented. To introduce nitrogen and sulfur heteroatoms in the carbon structure, lignin is modified by imidazolation through thiol-alkynes click reaction. Imidazolelignin shows a strong chelation tendancy with cobalt salt, and N and the S co-doped cobalt sulfide catalyst (IL-Co@GC-PO) is obtained by pyrolysis. The IL-Co@GC-PO has an oxygen evolution potential of 1.57 V and a hydrogen evolution overpotential of 204 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2). During the overall water splitting process, the IL-Co@GC-PO catalysts require only 1.58 V to reach a current density of 10 mA cm(-2), which is equivalent to the performance of the system composed of the noble metal Pt/C parallel to RuO2. This work not only provides a strategy for the preparation of N and S co-doped cobalt sulfide catalysts, but also provides guidance for using lignin as a carbon source to design and develop cheap electrocatalysts.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			2366-7486			WOS:000792450000001

New studies have shown the electrocatalytic activity capability of amino-acid-functionalized graphene oxide (GO) toward the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The improved active sites and further tunable and huge surface area after L-lysine functionalization on reduced graphene oxide (Ly-rGO) offer significant opportunities for further enhancement in the OER activity. Herein, the functionalization of GO with terminal nitrogen-containing groups (L-lysine) results in efficient and stable electrocatalytic activity for OER with a lower overpotential of 0.33 V at 10 mA cm(-2) and a lower Tafel slope of 80 mV dec(-1). Electrochemical impedance spectroscopic of Ly-rGO also shows a lower R-ct = 29.58 Omega and an excellent current stability for 5000 s at an onset potential of 1.29 V vs SCE in 0.5 M KOH. Morphological studies based on high-resolution transmission electron microscopy confirm that the size of Ly-rGO is similar to 5 nm. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopic analysis confirms the surface functionalization of GO by lysine (Ly-rGO) from the binding energies of C-N, C-O, and C-C. From this perspective, our findings emphasize the usefulness of metal-free amino-acid-functionalized carbon-based electrocatalysts for OER, which is an important water-splitting reaction, and demonstrates that they may be keys toward enhancement in activities.									27	0	0	0	3	0	27			2168-0485			WOS:000526375000012

In this work, a facile layered double hydroxides in situ transformation strategy is developed to synthesize ultrathin bimetal-MOF nanosheets (BMNSs) arrays on conductive substrates. This approach is versatile, and applicable to obtain various BMNSs or even trimetal-MOF nanosheets arrays on different substrates. As a proof of concept application, the obtained ultrathin NiCo-BDC BMNSs array exhibits an excellent catalytic activity toward the oxygen evolution reaction with an overpotential of only 230 mV to reach a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) in 1 m KOH. The present work demonstrates a strategy to prepare ultrathin bimetal-MOF nanosheets arrays, which might open an avenue for various promising applications of MOF materials.									105	6	0	0	7	0	109			1613-6810	1613-6829		WOS:000458313900015	30645051

Herein, an advanced highly-quality 3D-ordered macro-/mesoporous Co3O4/CeO2 heterostructure catalyst (3DOM-Co3O4/CeO2) was developed by combining two kinds of metal oxides with special intrinsic characteristics via a simple strategy. The as-prepared 3DOM-Co3O4/CeO2 shows ordered multistage interconnected mesoporous channels, which provide a sizable electrochemical active area and enrich the oxygen vacancy (OV) concentration at the Co3O4 and CeO2 interface. As expected, 3DOM-Co3O4/CeO2 with the optimal ratio of Co/Ce (3DOM-CC-10) exhibits a satisfactory catalytic activity and remarkable cycling performance when evaluated as an anode material for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The superior OER performance of 3DOM-CC-10 can be attributed to its structure with many OVs, the synergy effect between the two kinds of metal oxides and the 3D-ordered multistage porous conductive networks.									20	1	0	0	0	0	20			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000589418400035

In this communication, we report that cobalt phosphide nanoarray in situ grown on Ti mesh (CoP NA/TM) behaves as a durable robust non-noble-metal electrocatalyst for sodium sulfide (Na2S) oxidation with the need of potential of 1.31 V to drive 20 mA cm(-2) in 1.0 M KOH with 50 mM Na2S. The high hydrogen-evolving activity for CoP NA/TM enables it as a bifunctional catalyst electrode for energy-efficient electrochemical hydrogen generation by replacing OER with Na2S oxidation reaction. The CoP NA/TMIICoP NA/TM couple needs a cell voltage of 1.49 V to drive 15 mA cm 2, 210 mV less than of pure water splitting, with strong long-term electrochemical durability and 100% Faradic efficiency for hydrogen evolution.

Hydrogen is the perfect candidate for renewable energy; however, efficient O-2 gas production is associated with a lack of active electrocatalysts that could be low cost effective and comparable to the performance of noble metal RuO2. The newly developed composite has a Tafel slope of 65 mV dec(-1) for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) for the nonprecious Mn-Ni-Co-based electrocatalyst. This mixed oxide alloy possesses excellent oxygen evolution activity in alkaline media with the composite material. It is best of fit to produce OER in 1 M KOH media at 1.41 V onset potential, 230 mV overpotential, and the catalyst is highly durable for 40 hr. The electrochemical impedance spectroscopy study strongly provides the fast OER kinetics of 86.5 omega charge transfer resistance. An active catalyst is needed for the cheaper generation oxygen gas production on large scale. Thus, outperform, stable, and inexpensive catalysts are highly demanded O-2 gas production from the electrolysis of water through oxygen evolution. Herein, we present an efficient and highly stable catalyst based on transition metal oxide ternary Mo-Ni-Co nanostructures and their composite for water splitting in basic conditions for the first time. The presented catalysts are up to the mark of ruthenium oxide performance and superior to several transition metal dichalcogenides. This fabrication technology is a new roadmap for the development of active and scalable oxygen-evolving catalysts by overcoming the issues of fewer catalytic edges, low density, and poor conductivity. The obtained results demonstrate highly favorable on the Mn-Ni-Co for OER due to 173.20 omega small charge transfer resistance values and 1.97 mF capacitance values.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			0009-4536	2192-6549		WOS:000706836400001

Herein, we report a flexible bifunctional oxygen catalyst thin film consisting of Co-N-C bifunctional catalysts embedding in carbon nanotube (CNT) networks. The catalyst is readily prepared by pyrolysis of cobalt-based zeolitic imidazolate frameworks (ZIF-67) that are in-situ synthesized in CNT networks. Such catalyst film demonstrates very high catalytic activities for oxygen reduction (onset potential: 0.91V, and half-wave potential: 0.87V vs. RHE) and oxygen evolution (10mA cm(-2) at 1.58V) reactions, high methanol tolerance property, and long-term stability (97% current retention). Moreover, our integrated catalyst film shows very good structure flexibility and robustness. Based on the obtained film air electrodes, flexible Zn-air batteries demonstrate low charging and discharging overpotentials (0.82V at 1 mA cm(-1)) and excellent structure stability in the bending tests. These results indicate that presently reported catalyst films are potential air electrodes for flexible metal-air batteries.

Perovskite Ba0.5Sr0.5Co0.8Fe0.2O3-delta (BSCF) has emerged as a promising OER electrocatalyst with desirable intrinsic activity. Inspired by the factor that substituting in transition-metal sublattice of the perovskite can further optimize the OER activity, herein, nickel-substituted BSCF is adopted, that is, Ba0.5Sr0.5Co0.8-xFe0.2NixO3-delta (x = 0.05, 0.1, 0.2, denoted as BSCFNx, x = 5, 10, 20, respectively), as efficient and stable OER catalysts in alkaline solution. The phase structure, microchemistry, oxygen vacancy, and electrochemical activity of such samples are well-investigated. Endowed with an overpotential of only 278 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) and a Tafel slope of merely 47.98 mV dec(-1), BSCFN20 exhibits the optimum OER activity. When constructing a two-electrode cell with BSCFN20 as anode and Pt/C as cathode (BSCFN20||Pt/C) for water splitting, it only requires a voltage of 1.63 V to achieve 50 mA cm(-2), and the BSCFN20||Pt/C remains stable within 80 h at 10 mA cm(-2), superior to the state-of-the-art RuO2||Pt/C counterpart. This work provides a feasible strategy for designing stable and highly active perovskite electrocatalysts for future energy storage and conversion.									24	1	0	0	0	0	22			1613-6810	1613-6829		WOS:000598906100001	33325635

However, RePCC technology is limited by the lack of durable air electrode materials with high activity toward the oxygen reduction/evolution reaction and water formation/water-splitting reaction. Herein, a novel nanocomposites concept for developing bifunctional RePCC electrodes with exceptional performance is reported. By harnessing the unique functionalities of nanoscale particles, nanocomposites can produce electrodes that simultaneously optimize reaction activity in both fuel cell/electrolysis operations. In this work, a nanocomposite electrode composed of tetragonal and Ruddlesden-Popper (RP) perovskite phases with a surface enriched by CeO2 and NiO nanoparticles is synthesized. Experiments and calculations identify that the RP phase promotes hydration and proton transfer, while NiO and CeO2 nanoparticles facilitate O-2 surface exchange and O2- transfer from the surface to the major perovskite. This composite also ensures fast (H+/O2-/e(-)) triple-conduction, thereby promoting oxygen reduction/evolution reaction activities.

Herein, we describe the synthesis of a defect-rich electrocatalytically active Co9S8-CoSe2 heterostructure and its electrochemical water splitting performance for the development of a water electrolyzer. The Co9S8-CoSe2 heterostructure is synthesized in a single step by a solvothermal approach, and it has a defect-rich nanoflake-like morphology. The in situ grown Co9S8 and CoSe(2)2 are chemically coupled. The heterostructure is electrocatalytically active toward the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER). It delivers the benchmark current density of 10 mA/cm(2) for HER at an overpotential of 61 and 150 mV in acidic and alkaline pH, respectively. It is also highly active toward OER and requires 340 mV to attain 10 mA/cm(2). The superior electrocatalytic performance of the Co9S8-CoSe2 heterostructure is ascribed to geometrical and electronic effects. Defect-rich Co9S8-CoSe2 nanoflakes have abundant catalytically active sites that promote electrolyte contact and favor facile electron transfer kinetics. Electronic interaction and chemical coupling between Co9S8-CoSe2 modulate chemisorption energies of hydrogen- and oxygen-containing intermediates for better electrocatalytic performance. Post-OER analysis reveals that the Co9S8-CoSe2 heterostructure serves as a precatalyst and transforms to electrocatalytically active CoOOH during OER. As a proof-of-concept demonstration, a lab-made water electrolyzer is fabricated using the Co9S8-CoSe2 heterostructure-based anode and cathode. The device delivers 10 mA/cm(2) current density at a cell voltage of 1.66 V and retains 85% of its initial current density even after 20 h of continuous electrolysis.									27	1	0	0	3	0	28				2574-0970		WOS:000595546500081

Herein, a new molecular precursor [tris(morpholinodithiocarbamato)Co(III)] has been synthesized and the X-ray crystal structure of the complex determined. The precursor was used to prepare oleylamine (OLA)-capped cobalt sulfide nanoplatelets, using a facile hot injection method at two different temperatures (200 degrees C and 260 degrees C). The characterization of the samples shows that CoS synthesized at 200 degrees C is slightly sulfur rich, whereas CoS synthesized at 260 degrees C is slightly cobalt rich. The effect of off-stoichiometry of CoS nanoplatelets on the energy generation and storage applications was studied. The oxygen evolution reaction catalytic performance of both samples indicate overpotentials of 307 and 276mV as well as Tafel slopes of 96 and 82mV/dec, respectively. Similarly, overpotentials of 132 and 153mV were observed for the hydrogen evolution reaction, with Tafel slopes of 159 and 154mV/dec, respectively. The capacitive behavior of the samples was also examined, and specific capacitance values of 298 and 440F/g were obtained with cycling stabilities of 73 and 97%, after 5000 cycles, respectively. The results indicate that sulfur-deficient CoS can show superior performance for efficient energy generation and storage devices.									29	0	0	0	1	0	29			2196-0216			WOS:000471342200026

Here, a facile strategy is provided to synthesize a series of Co-based self-supported electrode materials by combining electrospinning and chemical vapor deposition (CVD) technologies. The Co, Co3O4, Co9S8 nanoparticles (NPs) are formed in situ simultaneously with the formation of carbon nanofibers (CNFs) during the CVD process, respectively. The Co-based NPs are uniformly distributed through the CNFs and they can be directly used as the electrode materials for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in acid and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in alkaline. The Co9S8/CNFs membrane exhibits the best HER activity with overpotential of 165 mV at j = 10 mA cm(-2) and Tafel slope of 83 mV dec(-1) and OER activity with overpotential of 230 mV at j = 10 mA cm(-2) and Tafel slope of 72 mV dec(-1). The onion-like graphitic layers formed around the NPs not only improve the electrical conductivity of the electrode but also prevent the separation of the NPs from the carbon matrix as well as the aggregation.									15	2	0	0	1	0	15			0934-0866	1521-4117		WOS:000413568400013

As a result, Pt3Co/C NPs exhibit high crystallinity with small average size and narrow size distribution. Moreover, the ordered Pt3Co/C NPs own enhanced ORR catalytic performance in acid. During the preparation process, the NaCl-matrix acts synergistically with carbon black as nanoreactors for Pt alloying with Co, avoiding serious sintering resulted by annealing at high temperature. Furthermore, other Pt-based NPs supported on carbon can also be prepared by this methodology.									3	1	0	0	0	0	4			0947-7047	1862-0760		WOS:000635053800001

All manganites exhibited spinel structure with tetragonal distortion. The reaction rate depends on the [Mn4+]/[Cu2+ + Cr3+ + Mn3+] surface ratio. The ORR occurs through ''interactive'' and ''parallel'' pathways depending on the oxide composition parameter x.

Herein, few carbon-layers-encapsulated NiFe nanoparticles (NiFe@C) were prepared as a simple and effective facile top-down approach when used with the electrical explosion of wire process as a bifunctional electrocatalyst to achieve higher overall water splitting efficiency. Uniformly surrounding the unique structure of NiFe nanoparticles (similar to 15 nm in diameter) by a small number of carbon layers can be accomplished via one-pot synthesis by exploding NiFe wires in an ethanol media. The simply prepared NiFe@C catalyst exhibits remarkable catalytic activity and stability in alkaline solution for both OER (oxygen evolution reaction) and HER (hydrogen evolution reaction). When bifunctional electrocatalysts are utilized as electrodes for both cathode and anode reactions in a single electrolyzer, outstanding catalytic performance was achieved with an operational voltage of 1.575 V at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2). Most importantly, the electrodes displayed superior catalytic stability in the overall water splitting reaction for 200 h. Consequently, this work proposes and evaluates this effective new strategy for the synthesis of low-cost, highly efficient and stable bifunctional electrocatalysts. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc.

Among all candidates, non-precious transition metal composite materials with the appropriate components and nanostructures are promising for the ORR and OER. Herein, a composite comprising a CoMn alloy coated with N-doped carbon and MnO is synthesized by a facile strategy involving the annealing of a Prussian blue analogue. The derived heterogeneous composite includes the benefits of a CoMn alloy, N-doped carbon and MnO, giving a low onset potential (0.91 V), positive half-wave potential (0.76 V) and large limiting current density (5.8 mA cm 2). The enhanced ORR activity can be attributed to the optimal surface electronic configuration of the alloy, which facilitates intermediate dissociation, in combination with heterojunctions, which favor charge transfer from the alloy and oxide. In addition, the electrocatalyst displays promising activity for the OER with an onset potential of 1.53 V and a low potential of 1.65 V at 10 mA cm 2, highlighting its prospect as an efficient bifunctional electrocatalyst.									17	0	0	0	1	0	17			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000488618600018

To develop an alternative way to use e-waste (waste copper (Cu) wires) to accelerate the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) of water electrolysis, the waste Cu wires are used as a low-cost current collector. We demonstrate a simple electrodeposition process to deposit nickel-iron hydroxide (NiFe LDH) nanosheets on self-supported copper hydroxide (Cu(OH)(2)/Cu) nanowires grown via chemical-oxidation on waste Cu wire. Benefiting from the efficient electron transport, high mass activity, and surface area this electrocatalyst exhibits an efficient OER performance with a low overpotential of 275 mV and 390 mV at 20 and 100 mA cm(-2) respectively, with excellent stability.

Examples of this fruitful symbiosis are dealloyed core shell nanoparticle electrocatalysts, which often exhibit enhanced kinetic charge transfer rates at greatly improved atom-efficiency. As such, they represent ideal electrocatalyst architectures for the acidic oxygen reduction reaction to water (ORR) and the acidic oxygen evolution reaction from water (OER) that require scarce Pt- and Ir-based catalysts. Together, these two reactions constitute the "O-cycle", a key elemental process loop in the field of electrochemical energy interconversion between electricity (free electrons) and molecular bonds (H2O/O-2), realized in the combination of water electrolyzers and hydrogen/oxygen fuel cells.In this Account, we describe our recent efforts to design, synthesize, understand, and test noble metal-poor dealloyed Pt- and Ir core-shell nanoparticles for deployment in acidic polymer electrolyte membrane (PEM) electrolyzers and PEM fuel cells. Spherical dealloyed Pt core-shell particles, derived from PtNi3 precursor alloys, showed favorable ORR activity. More detailed size activity correlation studies further revealed that the 6-8 nm diameter range is a most desirable initial particle size range in order to maximize the particle Ni content after ORR testing and to preserve performance stability. Similarly, dealloyed and oxidized IrOx core shell particles derived from Ni-rich Ir Ni precursor particles proved highly efficient oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalysts in acidic conditions. In addition to the noble metal savings in the particle cores, the Pt core-shell particles are believed to benefit in terms of their mass-based electrochemical kinetics from surface lattice strain effects that tune the adsorption energies and barriers of elementary steps. The molecular mechanism of the kinetic benefit of the dealloyed IrOx particle needs more attention, but there is mounting evidence for ligand hole effects in defect-rich IrOx shells that generate preactive oxygen centers.									98	2	0	0	3	0	98			0001-4842	1520-4898		WOS:000388154800031	27797179

Notably, this all-carbon composite without any transition-metal or heteroatom doping exhibits excellent performance towards both oxygen evolution and oxygen reduction reactions. Our characterizations reveal that the enhancement can be ascribed to the porous-rich structure and large specific surface areas in the integrated nanocarbons architectures.

Precious metals including Ir, Ru. and Pt are traditional OER catalysts, but recent emphasis has been placed on finding less expensive, earth-abundant materials with high OER activity. Ni-based materials are promising next-generation OER catalysts because they show high reaction rates and good long-term stability. Unfortunately, most catalyst samples contain heterogeneous particle sizes and surface structures that produce a range of reaction rates and rate-determining steps. Here we use a combination of experimental and computational techniques to study the OER at a supported organometallic nickel complex with a precisely known crystal structure. The Ni-6(PET)(12) (PET = phenylethyl thiol) complex out performed bulk NiO and Pt and showed OER activity comparable to Ir. Density functional theory (DFT) analysis of electrochemical OER at a realistic Ni-6(SCH3)(12) model determined the Gibbs free energy change (Delta G) associated with each mechanistic step. This allowed computational prediction of potential determining steps and OER onset potentials that were in excellent agreement with experimentally determined values. Moreover, DFT found that small changes in adsorbate binding configuration can shift the potential determining step within the OER mechanism and drastically change onset potentials. Our work shows that atomically precise nanocatalysts like Ni-6(PET)(12) facilitate joint experimental and computational studies because experimentalists and theorists can study nearly identical systems. These types of efforts can identify atomic-level structure-property relationships that would be difficult to obtain with traditional heterogeneous catalyst samples.									71	2	0	0	2	0	71			2155-5435			WOS:000369774900084

A coaxial cable-like structure with carbon fiber skeleton coated by nanostructured porous and defect-rich graphene skin is in situ fabricated through a facile H-2 etching approach. With abundant heteroatoms and defects as active sites, the nanocarbon shells coated carbon cloth exhibits excellent OER/ORR bifunctional activity. The OER and ORR current densities on graphene skin modified carbon fiber are 20 and 3 times higher than those of pristine carbon cloth, respectively. This emerging carbon cloth derived electrocatalyst with porous graphene skin also serves as the air electrode in a rechargeable flexible solid-state Zn air battery with polymer gel electrolyte, and demonstrates stable charge/discharge cycling even under bending. This strategy of constructing nanostructures directly on carbon fibers benefits the rational design of flexible and functionalized materials for electrocatalytic energy applications.									113	10	0	0	5	0	113			2405-8297			WOS:000449521500016

A solution processed soak-and-coat method of electroless plating was used to render a piece of paper conducting by conformably depositing metallic nickel nanoparticles, while still retaining the open macroporous framework. Proof-of-concept paper-electrodes are realized by modifying nickel-paper current collector with model electrocatalysts nickel-iron oxyhydroxide and nickel-molybdenum bimetallic alloy through electrodeposition route. The paper-electrodes demonstrate exceptional activities towards oxygen evolution reaction and hydrogen evolution reaction, requiring overpotentials of 240 and 32 mV at 50 and -10 mA cm(-2), respectively, even as they endure extreme mechanical stress. The generality of this approach is demonstrated by fabricating similar electrodes on cotton fabric, which also show high activity. Finally, a two-electrode paper-electrolyzer is constructed which can split water with an efficiency of 98.01%, and exhibits robust stability for more than 200 h.									80	1	0	0	6	0	80			2041-1723			WOS:000432665900009	29789569	
J	Krusic, PJ; Roe, DC; Smart, BE								Kinetics of hexafluoropropylene oxide pyrolysis studied by gas-phase NMR. Kinetic measurements made easy								ISRAEL JOURNAL OF CHEMISTRY				39	2			117	123						1999	1999	Gas-phase NMR complemented with a high-temperature probe makes possible quantitative kinetic studies of homogeneous vapor-phase reactions with unprecedented ease, as demonstrated with a study of the thermal fragmentation of hexafluoropropylene oxide. The reaction follows strictly first-order kinetics, is unaffected by surface chemistry, and the resulting Arrhenius activation parameters compare well with those obtained by more laborious classical methods of gas-phase reaction kinetics. The fragmentation kinetics is also unaffected by the presence of oxygen. The profiles for the evolution of the final products in this case show very graphically that singlet difluorocarbene, one of the initial products of the fragmentation of hexafluoropropylene oxide, does not react with oxygen, a ground-state triplet, at chemically significant rates.									23	0	0	0	0	0	23			0021-2148			WOS:000082013800003
