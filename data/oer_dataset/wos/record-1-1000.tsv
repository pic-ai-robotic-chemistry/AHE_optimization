Promoting the reaction rates and decreasing the overpotentials of the electrocatalysts for oxygen evolution reaction are critical for their practical application. Herein, we realize the first successful synthesis of Co2N0.67 with three-dimensional architecture of hierarchical meso-macroporous nanoflowers stacked by the nanoplates with polystyrene spheres as the template. The Co2N0.67 nanoflowers exhibit both low overpotential (258 mV at 10 mA cm(-2)) and low Tafel slope (52.22 mV dec(-1)) as well as superior stability for oxygen evolution reaction in alkaline medium, which makes Co2N0.67 nanoflowers to be one of best earth-abundant elements based electrocatalysts toward oxygen evolution reaction to date. Importantly, being different from the previous observation that the cobalt nitrides with higher nitrogen content possess lower oxygen evolution reaction electrocatalytic abilities, we find Co2N0.67 exhibits higher oxygen evolution reaction activity than Co5.4N. The density functional theory calculations reveal that during the oxygen evolution reaction, the oxidation step from O* to OOH* on Co2N0.67 and Co5.47N is considered as the rate-determining step, making oxygen evolution reaction to be more thermodynamically favorable on Co2N0.67 than that on Co5.47N.

Three 2D Fe-MOFs with NH, O, and S ligands were designed using density functional theory calculations, and their feasibility as SACs for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), oxygen evolution reaction (OER), and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) was investigated. The NH, O, and S ligands can be used to control electronic structures and catalysis performance in 2D Fe-MOF monolayers by tuning charge redistribution. The results confirm the Sabatier principle, which states that an ideal catalyst should provide reasonable adsorption energies for all reaction species. The 2D Fe-MOF nanomaterials may render highly-efficient HER, OER, and ORR by tuning the ligands. Therefore, we believe that this study will serve as a guide for developing of 2D MOF-based SACs for water splitting, fuel cells, and metal-air batteries.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5				1420-3049		WOS:000771383000001	35268628

Here we present lithium cobalt oxide, synthesized at 400 degrees C (designated as LT-LiCoO2) that adopts a lithiated spinel structure, as an inexpensive, efficient electrocatalyst for the oxygen evolution reaction. The catalytic activity of LT-LiCoO2 is higher than that of both spinel cobalt oxide and layered lithium cobalt oxide synthesized at 800 degrees C (designated as HT-LiCoO2) for the oxygen evolution reaction. Although LT-LiCoO2 exhibits poor activity for the oxygen reduction reaction, the chemically delithiated LT-Li1-xCoO2 samples exhibit a combination of high oxygen reduction reaction and oxygen evolution reaction activities, making the spinel-type LTLi0,5CoO2 a potential bifunctional electrocatalyst for rechargeable metal-air batteries. The high activities of these delithiated compositions are attributed to the Co4O4 cubane subunits and a pinning of the Co3+/4+:3d energy with the top of the O2-:2p band.									492	14	0	0	22	0	494			2041-1723			WOS:000337505800001	24862287

APPLIED SURFACE SCIENCE				528						146591	10.1016/j.apsusc.2020.146591				OCT 30 2020	2020	We use density functional theory based calculations to study the energetics of the oxygen evolution reaction on a monolayer of MoS2. This material, a prototypical example of a layered transition metal dichalcogenide, is intensely studied in the context of many important catalytical applications, in particular for the hydrogen evolution reaction. The second half-reaction of the water-splitting process, the oxygen evolution reaction, is almost never considered on this material, due to its low activity. Based on our calculations, we explain this experimentally observed poor catalytic activity for the oxygen evolution by the weak binding of two key reaction intermediates (hydroxyl and hydroperoxyl) to the substrate. We explore substitutional doping with oxygen and phosphorous as means to facilitate the oxygen evolution on MoS2 layers. The oxygen substitution slightly increases the reaction's overpotential, but does not significantly change the energetics. The doping with phosphorous, on the other hand, is not a promising way to promote the oxygen evolution on MoS2 layers. We also explore the role of the edges of MoS2 layers. We find that while the adsorption energies of reaction intermediates are strongly influenced by the presence of an edge, the final reaction overpotential remains nearly the same as on a pristine monolayer, meaning that the presence of edges is not favoring the OER.									17	2	0	0	0	0	17			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000576738700004

However, this technology is limited by the anodic oxygen evolution reaction that controls the overall operation efficiency, since only few electrocatalysts are efficient under the strongly acidic and oxidative conditions. Accordingly, there is a need for electrocatalysts with high activity, high stability, and low cost for the reaction of acidic oxygen evolution. Here, we review electrocatalysis using the acidic oxygen evolution reaction. We discuss two mechanisms of the oxygen evolution reaction: the adsorbate evolution mechanism and the lattice oxygen mechanism. We then summarize strategies to improve the performance of electrocatalysts by active site engineering, electron distribution optimization, interaction modulation, vacancy engineering, and lattice strain regulation. Challenges include the understanding of mechanisms of the oxygen evolution reaction, the operation durability at industrial currents, the flow reactor design of proton exchange membrane water electrolyzers, the alternative reactions, the development of nonprecious metal-based electrocatalysts, and large-scale synthetic approaches of electrocatalysts. Finally, precautions for electrochemical tests are proposed.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			1610-3653	1610-3661		WOS:000799660400001

Perovskite oxides are supposed as attractive low-cost alternative electrocatalysts for oxygen evolution reaction relative to the IrO2 and RuO2 electrocatalysts. In this study, Fe-Ni coupled perovskite oxides, Pr0.5Ba0.5Fe1-xNixO3-delta, are proposed as novel electrocatalysts for oxygen evolution reaction in alkaline solution. The electrocatalytic activity of perovskites are optimized by engineering the couple of Fe-Ni cations. We identify a possible correlation between the enhancement in the activity and the amount of surface oxygen vacancies, OH- adsorption, charge transfer kinetics as well as e(g)-filling. The Pr0.5Ba0.5Fe0.975Ni0.025O3-delta electrocatalyst demonstrates excellent activity for oxygen evolution reaction, favorably compared to other the state-of-the-art perovskite electrocatalysts.

The accuracy of the model is verified by experiments. The effects of current density, electrolyte flow rate, initial ion concentration, temperature and electrode porosity on the side reactions of hydrogen evolution and oxygen evolution were investigated. The effects of side reactions on the activation polarization and concentration polarization of the battery were studied by comparing the two cases of whether side reactions were considered or not. The results show that the reaction rate of hydrogen evolution and oxygen evolution can be effectively reduced by reducing the applied current density, ambient temperature or increasing the flow rate of electrolyte. Increasing the initial concentration of hydroxyl ions inhibited the occurrence of hydrogen evolution side reaction, but also promoted the occurrence of oxygen evolution side reaction. As the porosity of the positive electrode increases, the reaction rate of the side reaction of oxygen evolution and the oxygen concentration in the positive electrode area gradually decrease. In the later stage of charging, when the shielding effect of oxygen bubbles on the positive reaction interface is not considered, compared with the case without considering the side reactions, the positive electrode activation polarization is larger when considering the side reaction.

However, most of the reported HEAs focus on studying the compositional design and microstructure and mechanical properties of materials. There are relatively few studies on electrochemical performance and theoretical studies of HEAs. In addition, the potential applications of HEAs as energy storage materials for electrocatalysts have attracted widely attention in the development and application aspects of electrocatalysis. It can be attributed to their high conductivity, excellent structural stability and superior electrocatalytic activities with small overpotential and abundant active sites, which is comparable to the commercial noble metal catalysts. In this review, firstly, we briefly discuss the concept and structure characteristics of high entropy alloys. Then, the research progress of high-entropy alloys as electrocatalysis are also summarized, including hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), respectively. Finally, the future development trend of HEAs is also prospected for energy conversion fields.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1527-8999	1528-0691		WOS:000853914200001	36108141

In this work, we synthesize a hierarchically porous electrocatalyst (Co3C/Co-N-C/G) via a two-step process including hydrothermal and pyrolysis procedures. During the hydrothermal process, an acid-base reaction is induced to create abundant defects in the materials. Physicochemical characterizations of the catalyst suggest that the starting material of pyridine-3,4-dicarbonitrile leads to graphitic carbon structure, and stable Co-N-C and Co3C active centers are generated. Due to the synergistic effects among the components, the catalyst exhibits excellent catalytic activity for oxygen reduction and hydrogen evolution reactions, with performance comparable to those of the benchmark 20 wt% Pt/C, as well as good catalytic activity for oxygen evolution reaction, with a performance rivaling that of RuO2. The high catalytic performance of Co3C/Co-N-C/G makes it a promising candidate for energy conversion and storage devices.

The dissolution mechanism is complex and the correlation to the oxygen evolution reaction itself is still poorly understood. Here, by coupling a scanning flow cell with inductively coupled plasma and online electrochemical mass spectrometers, we monitor the oxygen evolution and degradation products of Ir and Ir oxides in situ. It is shown that at high anodic potentials several dissolution routes become possible, including formation of gaseous IrO3. On the basis of experimental data, possible pathways are proposed for the oxygen-evolution-triggered dissolution of Ir and the role of common intermediates for these reactions is discussed.									206	6	0	0	6	0	210			1433-7851	1521-3773		WOS:000425453300039	29219237

Finding efficient bifunctional oxygen catalysts is the ultimate goal and it has attracted a great deal of attention. The dilemma is that a good ORR catalyst is not necessarily efficient for OER, and vice versa. Thus, the development of a new type of bifunctional oxygen catalysts should ensure that the catalysts exhibit high activity for both OER and ORR. Composites with multicomponents for active centers supported on highly conductive matrices could be able to meet the challenges and offering new opportunities.

The electrolyte was modified by the addition of trace amounts of halide anions and alkali metal cations. Fluoride anions and potassium cations are most effective in reducing the overpotential of oxygen reduction and evolution reactions. Electrochemical studies and XPS analysis support the fact that the specific adsorption of F- inside the double layer changes the oxidation state from Mn(IV) to Mn(III), resulting in an increase in catalytic activity for oxygen reduction/evolution reactions.									11	0	0	0	0	0	11			1452-3981			WOS:000345261700008

Modelled polarisation curves of the oxygen evolution reaction were verified by polarisation curves experimentally measured in 5 M NaClO4 on a RDE of DSA material. The conditions in the simulations and in the experiments were similar to those in the chlorate process (high ionic strength, 70 degrees C, chromate-containing electrolyte, DSA electrode), in which the oxygen evolution reaction is one of the possible side reactions. The model predicted the concentration gradients of H+, OH-, CrO42- and HCrO4- during oxygen evolution on the RDE. It was found that an important part of the chromate buffering effect at high current densities occurs in a thin (in the order of nanometers) reaction layer at the anode. From comparisons between the model and experiments, a buffering reaction has been proposed. The most likely reaction for the chromate buffering in the investigated system is CrO42- reacting with water to HCrO4- and OH-. In the chlorate process, where chromate is a buffer and oxygen evolution is a side reaction, it is likely that chromate promotes oxygen evolution from OH-. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

The reaction current of oxygen evolution on lead was lower than that on lead-bismuth alloy at the same potentials in the anodic polarization curves. The volume of oxygen evolution on lead was smaller than that on lead-bismuth alloy at the same anodic potential. It was found that the oxygen evolution reactions on both lead and lead-bismuth alloys were controlled by charge transfer step. The reaction resistance for oxygen evolution obtained from the Nyquist plots on lead was larger than that on lead-bismuth alloy at the same anodic potentials. Bismuth in lead-bismuth alloys played a role that catalyzed oxygen evolution, but its effect was not remarkable and therefore the exist of water in bismuth would not increase the loss of water in the lead-acid battery.									0	2	0	0	0	0	2			1001-1579			INSPEC:8010364

We report here Ru(0) nanoclusters supported on nitrogen-doped graphene as high-performance multifunctional catalysts for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), showing activities similar to that of commercial Pt/C in alkaline solution. For HER performance in alkaline media, sample Ru/NG-750 reaches 10 mA cm(-2) at an overpotential of 8 mV with a Tafel slope of 30 mV dec(-1). The high HER performance in alkaline solution is advantageous because most catalysts for ORR and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) also prefer alkaline solution environment whereas degrade in acidic electrolytes. For ORR performance, Ru/NG effectively catalyzes the conversion of O-2 into OH- via a 4e process at a current density comparable to that of Pt/C. The unusual catalytic activities of Ru(0) nanoclusters reported here are important discoveries for the advancement of renewable energy conversion reactions.									84	3	0	0	5	0	85			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000393355900061	28055176

The obtained higher O-16(2) concentration in the evolved oxygen during the first scans is because O-16 from the IrO2 film contribute in the oxygen evolution reaction.Analysis of the experimental data has shown that the amount of lattice oxygen, which is involved in the oxygen exchange reaction, is in the order of 1% of the total IrO2 loading. This is an indication that only the outer surface of the oxide electrode participates in the oxygen evolution reaction.In a second series of experiments it has been demonstrated that oxygen evolution on (IrO2)-O-16 in (H2O)-O-18 containing electrolyte result in the formation of (IrO2)-O-18.Consequently, we can conclude that the IrO2 layers participate in the oxygen evolution reaction in acid media at least to a several monolayer extend.

Developing high efficient oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalysts requires determination of the optimal values of the descriptor parameters. Using spinel CoFe2O4 as the model catalyst, this work demonstrates that irradiation with pulsed UV laser can control the quantity of surface oxygen vacancy and thus modify the OER activity, in a volcano-shape evolution trend. This strategy sheds light on quantitatively investigation of the relationship between surface cation valence, anion vacancy, and physicochemical properties of transition-metal-based compounds.									3	2	0	0	0	0	4			1674-0068	1003-7713		WOS:000451271600013

Earth-abundant transition-metal oxides, in spite of their alluring performances in the oxygen evolution reaction, are thought to be inactive in the hydrogen evolution reaction in alkaline media. Here, we demonstrate that pure TiO2 single crystals, a typical transition-metal oxide, can be activated toward electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction in alkaline media through engineering interfacial oxygen vacancies. Experimental and theoretical results indicate that subsurface oxygen vacancies and low-coordinated Ti ions (Ti3+) can enhance the electrical conductivity and promote electron transfer and hydrogen desorption, which activate reduced TiO2 single crystals in the hydrogen evolution reaction in alkaline media. This study offers a rational route for developing reduced transition-metal oxides for low-cost and highly active hydrogen evolution reaction catalysts, to realize overall water splitting in alkaline media.									103	10	0	0	5	0	106			2155-5435			WOS:000431727300060

Conventionally, carbon-supported electrocatalysts have been used as the air electrode materials. However, these types of air electrodes have a problem that the carbon black is corroded to water-soluble organic compounds during oxygen evolution reaction. Therefore, we have investigated reduced graphene oxides as an alternative to the conventional carbon black. Cyclic voltammetry in the range of the potential in which the oxygen evolution reaction occurs revealed that the reduced graphene oxide is stable against corrosion during the oxygen evolution reaction. This result indicates that the reduced graphene oxide is a promising candidate electrode material for bi-functional air electrodes. To improve the oxygen reduction and evolution activities of reduced graphene oxides, doping of nitrogen species and loading of perovskite-type oxide catalysts to reduced graphene oxide were examined. It was found that doping of nitrogen species was effective for improving both the oxygen reduction and evolution activity. LaMnO3 and LaNiO3 catalysts were effective for improving the oxygen reduction and evolution activities, respectively. The best oxygen reduction and evolution activity was obtained by the LaMnO3-loaded nitrogen-doped reduced graphene oxide and LaNiO3-loaded nitrogen-doped reduced graphene oxide, respectively.[GRAPHICS].									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			0021-891X	1572-8838		WOS:000484609200009

Nanoporous Pd networks wi crystalline {111} faces were shown experimentally to serve mainly as active sites for the oxygen reductio reaction, whereas the Ir nanoparticles incorporated in the Pd nanoframe networks, where the optimized Ir:P ratio was 0.23:0.77 (n = 10), were responsible for the oxygen evolution reaction. Such three-dimensional ar chitectures provide a high density of active sites for the oxygen electrochemical reaction and facilitate electro transport. More importantly, the nanoporous Ir-Pd alloy nanocomposites exhibited similar stability for th oxygen reduction reaction but superior catalytic activity to the commercial Pd catalyst in alkaline solutions. In addition, the materials were also highly active for the oxygen evolution reaction, e.g., a small overpotential a 10 mA cm(-2) (1.628 V vs. reversible hydrogen electrode), making it a high-performance bifunctional catalyst for both the oxygen electrochemical reaction. Rotating ring-disk electrode measurements showed that the oxygen reduction and oxygen evolution reactions on the Ir-Pd catalysts proceeded predominantly through the desired 4-electron pathway.									20	0	0	0	0	0	20			1572-6657	1873-2569		WOS:000447479500016

Herein, we develop a promising hierarchical nickel-iron-copper nitride electrode that is fabricated via a three-step process, starting with a hydrothermal synthesis of nickel-iron hydroxide on nickel foam and followed by the direct growth of copper metal organic frameworks and, finally, low temperature ammonization. This approach yields a material that is an efficient catalyst for both the oxygen evolution reaction and the hydrogen evolution reaction. The as-fabricated heterostructured nickel-iron-copper nitride electrode exhibits an excellent activity with an overpotential of only 121 mV for the oxygen evolution reaction and an even a lower overpotential of 33 mV for the hydrogen evolution reaction.

The results show that hydrogen gas evolution reaction and oxygen gas consumption reaction occur on the surface of the reinforcement material during the early stage of ECE, and the hydrogen gas evolution reaction becomes dominant when oxygen gas is consumed to some extent. The hydrogen gas evolution reaction is mainly dependent on the electrical current density, and the constant of hydrogen gas generation kH2 has a linear relationship with electrical current density I as kH2 = 5.36 times 10-8 7-1.99 times 10-8. The oxygen gas consumption reaction is greatly varies with electrical current density during the early stage of ECE, and with the diffusion rate of oxygen gas towards the surface of concrete during the late stage of ECE.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0454-5648			INSPEC:11125551

The experimental spectra show two faradaic time constants. The appearance of these two time constants led us to propose a reaction mechanism with two intermediate iridium oxides. A theoretical model to account for the electrochemical impedance of the proposed model was developed. This model reproduces the features of the experimental spectra. Therefore, it can be concluded that, probably, the oxygen evolution reaction follows the proposed mechanism.									25	0	0	0	3	0	25			0013-4686			WOS:A1994MY42500015

The reduced number of physical/chemical variables combined with in-depth characterizations such as neutron dif-fraction, O K-edge X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS), electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS), magnetization and scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) studies, helps investigating the complex correlation between OER activity and a single perovskite property, such as the oxygen content. Larger amount of oxygen vacancies appears to facilitate the OER, possibly contributing to the mechanism involving the oxidation of lattice oxygen, i.e., the lattice oxygen evolution reaction (LOER). Furthermore, not only the number of vacancies but also their local arrangement in the perovskite lattice influences the OER activity, with a clear drop for the more stable, ordered stoichiometry.									13	0	0	0	1	0	13			1433-7851	1521-3773		WOS:000651105300001	33826206

Here, the electrochemical oxygen evolution reaction activities of a nanoporous gold (NPG)-based electrode in acidic media are investigated. The dependence of the oxygen evolution reaction activity on the NPG surface area shows that the large electrochemical surface areas of the NPG are effectively utilized to enhance electrocatalytic activity. The NPG surfaces are modified with Pt using atomic layer electrodeposition methods, and the resulting NPG@Pt exhibited enhanced electrocatalytic activities compared to those of the NPG and flat Pt electrodes. Ir-modified NPG (NPG@Ir) electrodes are prepared by spontaneous exchange of Ir on NPG surfaces and exhibit enhanced electrocatalytic activity compared to that of flat Ir surfaces. The modification of NPG@Pt with Ir results in NPG@Pt/Ir electrodes, and their electrocatalytic activities exceed those of NPG@Ir. The enhanced oxygen evolution reaction activity on NPG@Pt/Ir over that on NPG@Ir surfaces is examined by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. The oxygen evolution reaction activity on NPG@Pt/Ir surfaces demonstrates synergistic electrocatalysis between the nanoporous surface structure and active electrocatalytic components.									7	0	0	0	1	0	7			1040-0397	1521-4109		WOS:000474252600005

A huge class of compounds consisting of transition metal-based nitrides, carbides, chalcogenides, phosphides, and borides, which can be collectively termed transition metal non-oxides (TMNOs), has emerged recently as an efficient class of electrocatalysts in terms of performance and longevity when compared to transition metal oxides (TMOs). Moreover, the superiority of TMNOs over TMOs to effectively catalyze not only OERs but also HERs and ORRs renders bifunctionality and even trifunctionality in some cases and therefore can replace conventional noble metal electrocatalysts. In this review, the crystal structure and phases of different classes of nanostructured TMNOs are extensively discussed, focusing on recent advances in design strategies by various regulatory synthetic routes, and hence diversified properties of TMNOs are identified to serve as next-generation bi/trifunctional electrocatalysts. The challenges and future perspectives of materials in the field of energy conversion and storage aiding toward a better hydrogen economy are also discussed in this review.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1613-6810	1613-6829		WOS:000811134000001	35703063

The vacancy concentration was facilely tuned by plasma forming-gas following the order of Ar > O2 > H2/Ar. The oxygen vacancies obviously promoted oxygen evolution reaction (OER) performance. O2-plasma produced a moderate concentration of oxygen vacancy in LaFeO3 which exhibited the highest OER activity. DFT calculations confirmed that the weak hydroxyl adsorption was improved by oxygen vacancy, but excessive oxygen vacancies reduced the OER activity with strong hydroxyl adsorption energy.									4	0	0	0	1	0	3			0167-577X	1873-4979		WOS:000736673500010

Oxygen evolution reaction on lead-bismuth alloys in sulfuric acid solution								JOURNAL OF POWER SOURCES				158	2	SI		902	907		10.1016/j.jpowsour.2005.11.048				AUG 25 2006	2006	Lead-bismuth alloys with bismuth from 0 to 8 wt.% were prepared. Oxygen evolution reaction on the alloys with lead dioxides was investigated by using linear voltammetry, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, scanning electron spectroscopy, electron diffraction spectroscopy, oxygen collection experiments. The oxygen evolution reaction on the alloys with bismuth content < 0.1% is not affected by the bismuth in the alloys. However, the rate of oxygen evolution reaction increases with increasing the bismuth content in the alloys. This is related to the dissolution of bismuth from the alloys to solution and the adsorption of bismuth ions from solution onto the surface of lead dioxide. Unlike lead, bismuth can dissolve into solution under anodic polarization. At the potentials where there is no oxygen evolution, lead-bismuth alloys are well passivated by lead sulfate or lead dioxide. The lead dioxide on the alloys becomes porous when oxygen evolution takes place on it, thus bismuth in the alloys dissolves. The amount of dissolved bismuth increases with the bismuth content in the alloys and the adsorption of bismuth ions onto lead dioxide takes place when bismuth ion concentration near the oxide surface is high enough. The lead dioxide with adsorbed bismuth ions can accelerates oxygen evolution reaction and oxygen evolution increases with increasing the amount of adsorbed bismuth ions. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.

In this paper, CF/Cu2S composite structure was synthesized by one-step hydrothermal. Scanning electron microscope show that the proportion and morphology of needle-like and nano-flake Cu2S by adjusting the water alcohol ratio of hydrothermal reaction. Electrochemical characterization show that the oxygen evolution overpotential of CF/Cu2S with different morphology ranged from 239 mV to 384 mV. The CF/Cu2S with the water alcohol ratio of 9/1 has the lowerest oxygen evolution overpotential at 239 mV and Tafel slope at 199 mv-dec(-1) which is origined from the largerest contact area between electrons and electrolyte, thus improved charge transfer ability and effectively decrease the overpotential of oxygen evolution reaction.

The partial oxygen evolution currents have been determined during partial charging by measuring the charge distribution between the main electrochemical charge transfer reaction at the Ni-electrode and the parasitic oxygen evolution reaction. This enabled us to accurately determine the battery State-of-Charge during the entire charging process and to deduce information about the oxygen evolution reaction kinetics as a function of temperature. In addition, the oer kinetics has also been studied under continuous overcharging conditions. Substantial kinetic differences were observed. This has been attributed to the phase modification of nickel-oxyhydroxide induced by prolonged overcharging. The kinetic parameters of the oxygen evolution reaction have been determined, the mechanisms are discussed in detail and the relevant rate equations are derived to enable NiMH battery modelling.

Recent research has focused on understanding the factors governing the catalytic properties of nanostructured IrO2 in order to decrease the use of expensive and precious IrO2. We demonstrate here the equivalent diameter (D-e) effect (lateral size effect) of IrO2 nanosheets for the oxygen evolution reaction. IrO2 nanosheets with four different D-e from 110 to 260 nm and same thickness (similar to 1.5 nm) were prepared. The electrical double layer capacitance, which should be proportional to the electrochemically active surface area, of IrO2 nanosheets was independent of D-e. On the other hand, the pseudo-capacitance, which is related to surface redox processes, and the oxygen evolution reaction activity increased with decreasing D-e. The enhanced oxygen evolution reaction activity is discussed based on the electrochemically active surface area and edge effect.

Here, we report an electrocatalyst with Ru-atom-array patches supported on alpha-MnO2 (Ru/MnO2) for the oxygen evolution reaction following a mechanism that involves only *O and *OH species as intermediates. This mechanism allows direct O-O radical coupling for O-2 evolution. Ru/MnO2 shows high activity (161 mV at 10 mA cm(-2)) and outstanding stability with small degradation after 200 h operation, making it one of the best-performing acid-stable oxygen evolution reaction catalysts. Operando vibrational and mass spectroscopy measurements were performed to probe the reaction intermediates and gaseous products for validating the oxygen evolution reaction pathway. First-principles calculations confirmed the cooperative catalysis mechanism with a reduced energy barrier. Time-dependent elemental analysis demonstrated the occurrence of the in-situ dynamic cation exchange reaction during the oxygen evolution reaction, which is the key for triggering the reconstruction of Ru atoms into the ordered array with high durability.									40	1	0	0	1	0	41			2520-1158			WOS:000731300700007		
J	Ling, Chen; Zhou, Li Qin; Jia, Hongfei								First-principles study of crystalline CoWO4 as oxygen evolution reaction catalyst								RSC ADVANCES				4	47			24692	24697		10.1039/c4ra03893b				2014	2014	Cobalt tungstate (CoWO4) was recently reported as a catalyst that drives the oxygen evolution reaction. Interestingly, the catalytic activity of crystalline CoWO4 is orders of magnitude lower than its amorphous counterpart. In order to better understand the mechanical origin of these observations, herein we study the oxygen evolution on the crystalline CoWO4 surface using first-principles calculations. By comparing the calculated data with experimental measurements, we demonstrate that GGA + U calculations with U = 4.5 effectively predict the structural and electronic properties of crystalline CoWO4. With this U value the overpotential for oxygen evolution on the crystalline CoWO4 surface is 0.97 V. This prediction agrees fairly well with experimental estimation, and is consistent with the low catalytic activity of crystalline CoWO4. By a comprehensive analysis of the reaction process, such high overpotential is attributed to the instability of oxygen radicals formed during the oxygen evolution. Our results highlight the importance to stabilize oxygen radicals during oxygen evolution reaction. It also paves the road for future optimization of CoWO4 as oxygen evolution catalyst.									57	2	0	0	2	0	58				2046-2069		WOS:000338042800035

In particular, carbon nanotubes have attracted significant applications for electrocatalysis. However, one central issue related to the use of carbon nanotubes is the required oxidative pretreatment that often leads to significant damage of graphitic structures which deteriorates their electrochemical properties. Traditionally, the oxidized carbon nanomaterials are treated at high temperature under an inert atmosphere to repair the oxidation-induced defect sites, which simultaneously removes a significant number of oxygen functional groups. Nevertheless, recent studies have shown that oxygen functional groups on the surface of MWCNT are the essential active centers for a number of important electrocatalytic reactions such as hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), oxygen evolution reaction (OER), and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). Herein we first show that hydrothermal treatment as a mild method to improve the electrochemical properties and activities of surface-oxidized MWCNT for OER, HER, and ORR without significantly altering the oxygen content. The results indicate that hydrothermal treatment could potentially repair the defects without significantly reducing the pre-existing oxygen content, which has never been achieved before with conventional high temperature annealing treatment.									49	1	0	0	5	0	49			1944-8244			WOS:000391081700063	27991771

In this work, samples with different molar ratios of Ni to Fe are prepared by a typical hydrothermal method to study the effect of iron on the catalytic properties of NiFe-layered double hydroxide. All the NiFe-layered double hydroxides exhibit much better oxygen evolution reaction activity than NiOOH, while increasing the iron content slightly affects the activity, which implies that only Fe ions at some specific site contribute to the oxygen evolution reaction activity. The NiFe-layered double hydroxide with a 4:1 molar ratio of Ni to Fe shows the best oxygen evolution reaction catalytic performance, and requires only an overpotential of 176 mV to afford a current of I mA cm(-2) in 1.0M KOH, and exhibits a much lower Tafel slope (51 mVdec(-1)).

However, the kinetically sluggish oxygen-evolution reaction becomes the limiting step in the electrolysis of water. Copper-based materials have been reported as a good choice to catalyze the oxygen evolution reaction, but their performance is poor. We describe a Cu2-xSe@CuO/copper foam core-shell structure from the in situ electrochemical oxidation of Cu2Se/copper foam to promote the oxygen-evolution reaction performance. The presence of a semi-metallic Cu2-xSe core and nanostructured CuO shell at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) requires a low overpotential of 253 mV. The Tafel slope was only 73 mV dec(-1).

The Co3+ sites, the key radicals for bifunctional oxygen reduction and evolution reactions. Well-dispersed nitrogen-doped graphene serve as a platform for anchoring the interconnected nickel-cobaltite nanocrystals and improve the conductivity to maintain a high saturation current in oxygen reduction and low overpotential in evolution reaction, similar to Pt/C. Lifetimes as long as 200 h for oxygen reduction and 300 h for oxygen evolution are demonstrated with negligible degradations.

Ni-Zn-Fe electrode, which is electroplated in a modified Watts bath, showed 0.294 V of overpotential at 0.1 A/cm2. That result is better than that of Ni and Ni-Zn plated electrodes. As the electroplating current density of the Ni-Zn-Fe electrode increased, the particle size tended to increase and the overpotential of oxygen evolution reaction decreased. As reducing pH of electroplating solution from 4 to 2, Fe content in electrode and activity of oxygen evolution reaction decreased.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1738-7264			KJD:ART002415522

Its sluggish kinetics demands effective electrocatalysts to minimize the reaction barrier. Transition metal (oxy) hydroxides with a layered structure are one of the most active non-noble electrocatalysts. In this study, we compared the oxygen evolution performance of alpha-Co(OH)(2), beta-Co(OH)(2) and beta-CoOOH. Our results showed that alpha-type hydroxide is more active than beta-type with 60mV lower overpotential at 10mA/cm(2) and three times higher current density at 450mV overpotential. The plausible reason of this superior oxygen evolution activity is likely relevant to the large interlayer space in a-type hydroxide.

Previous works have demonstrated that pyrite-phase sulfides are promising electrocatalysts for oxygen evolution reaction, however the true active materials are still undetermined. Here, we report heteroatom Ni alloying into FeS2 crystal via a facile ball-milling reaction method to enhance electrocatalytic performances of pyrite-phase FeS2. A series of (Fe1-xNix)S-2 nanocrystalline materials are synthesized to systematically investigate the effects of Ni alloying on FeS2 toward oxygen evolution reaction electrocatalysis. To achieve an current density of 10 mA cm(-2), the (Fe0.5Ni0.5)S-2 at carbon fiber paper electrode requires an overpotential as low as 241 mV with a Tafel slope of 51.8 mV dec(-1) in 1 M KOH solution. Further investigations reveal that the derived hybrids of Fe3O4 nanoflakes and nanoporous Ni doped FeOOH are true active materials for the (Fe0.5Ni0.5)S-2 under oxygen evolution reaction conditions. This study not only reveals the true active materials of the heteroatom alloyed bimetallic sulfides, but also provides a facile strategy to regulate the formation of active materials for enhanced oxygen evolution catalysis.

Herein, we report the synthesis of three-dimensional porous nickel diselenide nanowrinkles anchored on nickel foam through fabricating nickel oxalate nanosheets on nickel foam by immersion, followed by selenization under a selenium vapor atmosphere. The hybrid material exhibits superior hydrogen evolution reaction and oxygen evolution reaction performances with high activity (low overpotential), favorable kinetics, and outstanding durability in alkaline solutions. An overpotential of merely 166 mV is needed to reach 10 mA cm(-2) for hydrogen evolution reaction and 235 mV for oxygen evolution reaction. The NiOOH species formed at the NiSe2 surface serves as the catalytic sites. Moreover, the electrolyzer only needs a cell voltage of 1.64 V to deliver 10 mA cm(-2) for overall water splitting and shows excellent long-term stability (80 h at 10 mA cm(-2)). The unique porous nanowrinkle structure, improved electrical conductivity, fast charge transfer kinetics, and large electrochemical surface area are responsible for the highly active and stable electrocatalric performance toward hydrogen evolution reaction/oxygen evolution reaction.									96	5	0	0	3	0	96			2168-0485			WOS:000424728300077

Nitrogen-doped carbon nanotubes encapsulated nickel nanoparticles are prepared through a simple pyrolysis procedure with melamine and nickel chloride hexahydrate as precursors. The catalyst is featured by nickel nanoparticles encapsulated inside nitrogen-doped carbon nanotubes, with abundant surface nitrogen doping. The optimized catalyst exhibits proximate oxygen reduction activity to platinum/carbon catalyst, comparable oxygen evolution activity to ruthenium dioxide catalyst, and better stability to noble metal catalysts in alkaline medium. The oxygen electrode activity parameter (the gap between the potential of oxygen evolution at 10 mA cm(-2) and the half-wave potential of oxygen reduction) of the as-prepared catalyst is 0.754 V, which is among the state-of-the-art bifunctional electrocatalysts reported to date. To explore the active sites, a series of catalysts with different bulk nickel and surface nitrogen contents are synthesized and served as the oxygen reduction and oxygen evolution reactions catalysts. The results reveal that the oxygen reduction activity of this catalyst arises from the doped nitrogen, while the oxygen evolution activity originates from the encapsulated nickel nanoparticles.									34	2	0	0	2	0	34			2168-0485			WOS:000449577200163

The degradation mechanism is complex and it is under intense discussion whether the oxygen molecule can be directly released from the oxide lattice. Here, we define the extent of lattice oxygen participation in the oxygen evolution and associated degradation of rutile and hydrous iridium oxide catalysts, and correlate this mechanism with the atomic-scale structures of the catalytic surfaces. We combine isotope labelling with atom probe tomography, online electrochemical and inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. Our data reveal that, unlike rutile IrO2, Ir hydrous oxide contains -(IrOOH)-O-III species which directly contribute to the oxygen evolution from the lattice. This oxygen evolution mechanism results in faster degradation and dissolution of Ir. In addition, near surface bulk regions of hydrous oxide are involved in the oxygen catalysis and dissolution, while only the topmost atomic layers of rutile IrO2 participate in both reactions. Overall our data provide a contribution to the fundamental understanding of the exceptional stability of Ir-oxides towards the oxygen evolution reaction. The proposed approach to a quantitative assessment of the degree of lattice oxygen participation in the oxygen evolution reaction can be further applied to other oxide catalyst systems.									85	3	0	0	9	0	87			1754-5692	1754-5706		WOS:000501225900006

Materials with x ranging between 0 and 0.2 were prepared by spray freeze freeze drying approach. Prepared materials show a non-homogeneous distribution of Ti in the structure with dominant clustering of the Ti along the (001) direction. For materials with x higher than 0.1 the dominant linear clustering of Ti along the z-axis changes, including Ti clustering also along (111) direction. Prepared materials are active in both oxygen evolution and chlorine evolution reactions. The Ti has a pronounced effect on the selectivity of the prepared materials. Ti presence affects the selectivity of the prepared materials in a complex manner. Materials featuring a low Ti content (x similar to 0.05) retain a preference for oxygen evolution reaction even in presence of chlorides and are more selective for oxygen evolution than pure RuO2. The selectivity towards chlorine evolution increases with increasing Ti content and, apparently, also with clustering of Ti along the (111) direction. The selectivity towards chlorine evolution may be related to the tendency of the prepared catalysts to evolve the oxygen via lattice oxygen evolution reaction (LOER) reflecting the ability of the catalyst surface to form active sites under operando conditions.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0013-4686	1873-3859		WOS:000852802700004

Herein, we focus on the role that morphology and composition play in the OER performance to rationally design freestanding 3D porous NiCo2O4 nanosheets with metal valence states alteration and abundant oxygen vacancies as robust electrocatalysts towards water splitting. Besides metal valence-state alteration, surface modification regarding the evolution of oxygen vacancies is facilely realized upon the sodium borohydride treatment, which is beneficial for the enhanced OER performance. Taking advantage of the porous nanostructures and abundant surface activity sites with high reactivity, the resultant nanostructures exhibit excellent OER activity and stability in alkaline electrolytes that outperform that of pristine NiCo2O4 and commercial RuO2, thus holding great potential for the water splitting.									138	3	0	0	7	0	139			0947-6539	1521-3765		WOS:000372526500002	26845062

Metal-free carbon-based catalysts potentially contribute to the catalytic materials for OER. However, it has been difficult to understand the intrinsic catalytic activity of carbon materials, due to catalyst decomposition over the course of long-term reactions. Here, we report high oxygen evolution reaction catalytic activity of F-doped carbon in alkaline media. Intrinsic OER activity was evaluated from a combination of measurements using a rotating disk electrode and O-2 sensor. The F-doped carbon catalyst is a highly active catalyst, comparable to state-of-the-art precious-metal-based catalysts such as RuO2.									5	0	0	0	1	0	5			1996-1944			WOS:000459719000015	30634557

We describe the synthesis of a bifunctional oxygen electrode with simultaneous activity for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in alkaline media by direct growth of nitrogen-doped carbon nanotubes on the surface of a perovskite containing Co and Fe by means of chemical vapor deposition. The difference in the overvoltage between ORR (at 1 mA/cm(2)) and OER (at 10 mA/cm(2)) was below 880 mV in 0.1 M KOH. The formation of H2O2 during the ORR was reduced by at least three fold when using the bifunctional catalyst as compared to the non-modified perovskite.

The composite material has two electrocatalytic active sites of cobalt and ruthenium. USE - Antimony doped lactate dehydrogenase/reduced graphene oxide composite material used as catalysts in electrolysis of water for hydrogen evolution (claimed). ADVANTAGE - The conductivity of hydrotalcite on large surface area of the graphene is enhanced. The anchoring effect of hydrotalcite is beneficial to avoid the agglomeration of hydrotalcite, increase the active specific surface area, and expose more active sites. The synergistic action reduces the energy barrier of electrocatalytic reaction, and reduces the electrocatalytic overpotential. Since the doping of ruthenium changes the electronic state of surface of composite, the increased oxygen deficiency helps the adsorption of intermediates at reactive sites, accelerates water electrolysis, and improves hydrogen evolution performance. DETAILED DESCRIPTION - INDEPENDENT CLAIMS are included for the following: (i) preparation of antimony doped lactate dehydrogenase/reduced graphene oxide composite material which involves ultrasonically dispersing of graphene oxide in an aqueous solution of cobalt nitrate, adding an aqueous solution of ruthenium(III) chloride, ultrasonically dispersing, and adding to an aqueous ammonia solution continuously fed with pure oxygen, stirring at 30-60 degrees C for 12-36 hours, washing and drying to obtain yttrium-doped lactate dehydrogenase/reduced graphene oxide composite; and (ii) application of electrolyzed water hydrogen evolution reaction which involves (1) uniformly mixing lanthanum-doped lactate dehydrogenase/reduced graphene oxide composite material with the conductive agent alkyne black at a mass ratio of 0.2-20, adding with ethanol, ultrasonically treating, adding with Nafion (RTM: sulfonated tetrafluoroethylene based fluoropolymer-copolymer) solution, uniformly mixing and coating on a conductive carbon paper current collector, drying at room temperature to obtain a hydrogen evolution reaction electrode, (2) placing prepared hydrogen evolution reaction electrode in an alkali solution, and using three-electrode system for the reaction.

The dependence of the activation energy of the elementary processes involved in the oxygen reaction on electrode potential is determined from the Arrhenius curves. On increase in potential the activation energy increases passing through a maximum and decreases thereafter. This change in activation energy is explained by the mechanism of the elementary processes of the oxygen reaction in which the hydrated layer of the lead dioxide is also involved.					1st Joint Meeting of the Electrochemical-Society / International-Society-of-Electrochemistry1st Joint Meeting of the Electrochemical-Society / International-Society-of-Electrochemistry	AUG 31-SEP 05, 1997AUG 31-SEP 05, 1997	Electrochem Soc; Int Soc ElectrochemElectrochem Soc; Int Soc Electrochem	PARIS, FRANCEPARIS, FRANCE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0					1-56677-146-3	WOS:A1997BJ44T00077

However, the development of cost-effective and efficient bifunctional catalysts for both reactions still remained a grand challenge. Herein, we report the electrocatalytic investigations of bamboo-shaped carbon nitrogen nanotubes (CNNTs) having different diameter distribution synthesized by liquid chemical vapor deposition technique using different nitrogen containing precursors. These CNNTs are found to be efficient bifunctional electrocatalyst for oxygen reduction and evolution reactions. The electrocatalytic activity strongly depends on the nanotube diameter as well as nitrogen functionality type. The higher diameter CNNTs are more favorable for these reactions. The increase in nanotube diameter itself enhances the catalytic activity by lowering the oxygen adsorption energy, better conductivity, and further facilitates the reaction by increasing the percentage of catalytically active nitrogen moieties in CNNTs.									99	7	0	0	4	0	101			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000356316700034	25970133

The crystal structure, surface morphology, pore size distribution, specific surface area, and voltammetric charge were then characterized for each electrode. The results demonstrated that for Mn-O electrodes, the preferential orientation of the (100) crystal plane and the mesopore structure played negative roles in the oxygen evolution reaction. On the basis of the electrocatalytic properties of MnO2- based electrodes in seawater, the outer surface voltammetric charge at a scan rate of 500 mVs(-1) was shown to effectively indicate whether oxygen evolution reactions were preferred over chlorine evolution reactions. The Mn-O electrode exhibited oxygen evolution efficiency of only 47.27%, whereas the Mn+Mo, Mn+Mo+V and Mn+Fe+V oxide electrodes displayed oxygen evolution efficiency of nearly 100%. This means that adding Mo, V, and Fe elements to the electrode can improve its crystal structure and morphology as well as further enhancing its oxygen evolution efficiency.									6	2	0	0	1	0	7			1000-2413	1993-0437		WOS:000465300500012

Metal hydroxide-organic frameworks are shown to act as a tunable catalytic platform for oxygen evolution, with pi-pi interactions dictating stability and transition metals modulating activity.The oxygen evolution reaction is central to making chemicals and energy carriers using electrons. Combining the great tunability of enzymatic systems with known oxide-based catalysts can create breakthrough opportunities to achieve both high activity and stability. Here we report a series of metal hydroxide-organic frameworks (MHOFs) synthesized by transforming layered hydroxides into two-dimensional sheets crosslinked using aromatic carboxylate linkers. MHOFs act as a tunable catalytic platform for the oxygen evolution reaction, where the pi-pi interactions between adjacent stacked linkers dictate stability, while the nature of transition metals in the hydroxides modulates catalytic activity. Substituting Ni-based MHOFs with acidic cations or electron-withdrawing linkers enhances oxygen evolution reaction activity by over three orders of magnitude per metal site, with Fe substitution achieving a mass activity of 80 A g(catalyst)(-1) at 0.3 V overpotential for 20 h. Density functional theory calculations correlate the enhanced oxygen evolution reaction activity with the MHOF-based modulation of Ni redox and the optimized binding of oxygenated intermediates.									21	0	0	0	1	0	21			1476-1122	1476-4660		WOS:000760696700002	35210585

First we construct the Pourbaix surface diagram for IrO2 and RuO2, and from this we find the chlorine evolution reaction intermediates and identify the lowest overpotential at which all elementary reaction steps in the chlorine evolution reaction are downhill in free energy. This condition is then used as a measure for catalytic activity. Linear scaling relations between the binding energies of the intermediates and the oxygen binding energies at cus-sites are established for MO2 (M being Ir, Ru, Pt, Ti). The linear relations form the basis for constructing a generalized surface phase diagram where two parameters, the potential and the binding energy of oxygen, are needed to determine the surface composition. We calculate the catalytic activity as function of the oxygen binding energy, giving rise to a Sabatier volcano. By combining the surface phase diagram and the volcano describing the catalytic activity, we find that the reaction mechanism differs depending on catalyst material. The flexibility in reaction path means that the chlorine evolution activity is high for a wide range of oxygen binding energies. We find that the required overpotential for chlorine evolution is lower than the overpotential necessary for oxygen evolution.									239	8	0	0	16	0	243			1463-9076	1463-9084		WOS:000272589000032	20024470

Hydrogen generation from solar-driven water splitting is a promising strategy to store solar energy in chemical bonds. The subsequent combustion of hydrogen in fuel cells produces electric energy, and the only exhaust is water. These two reactions compose an ideal process to provide clean and sustainable energy. In such a process, a hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), an oxygen evolution reaction (OER) during water splitting, and an oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) as a fuel cell cathodic reaction are key steps that affect the efficiency of the overall energy conversion. Catalysts play key roles in this process by improving the kinetics of these reactions. Porphyrin-based and corrole-based systems are versatile and can efficiently catalyze the ORR, OER, and HER Because of the significance of energy-related small molecule activation, this review covers recent progress in hydrogen evolution, oxygen evolution, and oxygen reduction reactions catalyzed by porphyrins and corroles.									783	39	2	0	44	1	790			0009-2665	1520-6890		WOS:000394829000025	28222601

However, the slow kinetics of oxygen reduction and/or evolution reactions largely hampers the efficiencies of PEMFCs and water electrolysis. Highly efficient electrocatalysts for oxygen reduction and evolution reactions must meet three requirements: (i) rapid transport of electrons, ions, and products of the reaction; (ii) sufficient catalysts/reactants contact area; and (iii) good intrinsic activity. Nanostructuration of electrocatalysts provides an effective approach to overcome the slow kinetics because nanostructured electrocatalysts with rational design can not only provide sufficient active sites but also promote intrinsic activity of electrocatalysts as well as possess the ability of rapid transport of electrons, ions, and products of the reaction. Especially, electrocatalysts in the form of one-dimensional nanostructures (1D-Nano) such as nanowires (NWs) and nanotubes (NTs) have shown significant advantages, such as high surface area, rapid electron and mass transfer, low vulnerability to dissolution, Ostwald ripening, and aggregation, for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). In this review, we summarize different strategies for fabricating 1D nanostructure-based electrocatalysts (1D-NanoECs), which are categorized into template-free and template-assisted strategies, and emphasis has been placed on anodic aluminum oxide template eassisted strategies. Then, recent advances of 1D-NanoECs for ORR and OER applications are summarized. Finally, future challenges and opportunities about 1D-NanoECs are discussed. (c) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

Recently, time-resolved spectroscopy of a photo-electrochemically driven oxygen evolution reaction followed the vibrational and optical spectra of this intermediate, denoted M-OH*. However, these inherently kinetic experiments have not been connected to the relevant thermodynamic quantities. Here we discover that picosecond optical spectra of the Ti-OH* population on lightly doped SrTiO3 are ordered by the surface hydroxylation. A Langmuir isotherm as a function of pH extracts an effective equilibrium constant relatable to the free energy difference of the first oxygen evolution reaction step. Thus, time-resolved spectroscopy of the catalytic surface reveals both kinetic and energetic information of elementary reaction steps, which provides a critical new connection between theory and experiment by which to tailor the pathway of water oxidation and other surface reactions.Theoretical descriptors differentiate catalytic activity for oxygen evolution reaction by the strength of oxygen binding in the reactive intermediate created upon electron transfer.

Oxygen evolution reaction is a half-reaction of water electrolysis process, and its efficiency has a great influence on the overall reaction. The morphology of the catalyst has a great influence on the catalytic performance of the catalyst for oxygen evolution, but the mechanism of the effect of the morphology on the activity is still unclear. Therefore, the influence of the catalyst morphology on the catalytic activity needs to be studied urgently. Co3O4 is widely used in oxygen evolution reactions. Therefore, we took three Co3O4 with different morphologies as the research objects to study the effect of morphology on the oxygen evolution activity of Co3O4. The results show that among the three different morphologies of cobalt tetroxide, the Co3O4 with porous sheet morphology exhibits the best oxygen evolution activity (eta10 = 1.54 V in 1 M KOH). The reason for the better activity of cobalt tetroxide with the morphology of the hollow sheet may be due to its larger specific surface area and more active sites, which reduces the reaction electron transfer barrier. Our work sheds new light on the design of novel oxygen evolution electrocatalysts.					3rd International Conference on Advanced Material and Clean Energy3rd International Conference on Advanced Material and Clean Energy	25-27 March 202225-27 March 2022		Sanya, ChinaSanya, China	0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1742-6596			INSPEC:21979179

As an extension of single-atom catalysts (SACS), dual-atom catalysts (DACs) provide new insights for the development of atomic-scale catalysts. Higher metal loading and more flexible active sites endow DACs with improved catalytic performance as well as optimized reaction mechanism model. In this review, DACs are firstly classified according to their configurations and metal sites. Subsequently, the synthetic strategies and characterization techniques of DACs are introduced. Furthermore, the applications of DACs are exemplified in various electrocatalytic reactions, including oxygen reduction reaction, oxygen evolution reaction and carbon dioxide reduction reaction. Finally, the prospects to be expected and challenges to be faced with are discussed.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2366-9608			WOS:000799031100001	35607754

Herein, we consider metal-nitrogen-carbon sheets which are commonly used for catalyzing the oxygen-reduction reaction (ORR), as the support to load NiO nanoparticles for the oxygen-evolution reaction (OER). FeNC sheets, as the advanced supports, synergistically promote the NiO nanocatalysts to exhibit superior performance in alkaline media, which is confirmed by experimental observations and density functional theory (DFT) calculations.

Here, this study reports the synergistically enhanced intrinsic oxygen evolution reaction activity of a FeNi model catalyst modified with molybdate oxo-anions via concertedly boosted surface/interface interactions such as interfacial charge transfer, surface intermediate adsorption, in situ phase transformation, and gas bubble evolution. Capturing such cosynergistic impact reveals the accelerated transition of oxygen deprotonation to oxyhydroxide state, ready-to-function Fe and Ni active sites, the instant transformation of Fe and Ni local microenvironments to gamma-FeOOH and beta-NiOOH phases, and ultrafast gas bubble growth and release. The accelerated oxygen bubble evolution dynamic is monitored in operando with a decreased dynamic variation of the interfacial Faradaic resistance. Such cosynergistic molybdate modification results in a tenfold increase in oxygen evolution turnover frequency as well as a 55 mV decrease in the overpotentials to deliver 10 and 1000 mA cm(-2) with respect to the FeNi-model catalyst.									10	1	0	0	0	0	10			1616-301X	1616-3028		WOS:000710071600001

In acidic media, the only well-established and active oxygen evolution catalysts are expensive noble metal oxides such as IrOx and RuOx, necessitating the development of practical oxygen evolution catalysts that are stable in acidic media. In this study, we prepared stoichiometric, phase-pure CoSb2O6 and MnSb2O6 electrodes using electrochemical synthesis and investigated their ability to oxidize water in 0.5 M H2SO4 (pH 0.3). In addition, their stabilities during the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) were carefully examined by comparing their morphologies, crystallinities, compositions, and surface compositions before and after the OER. The chlorine evolution reaction on CoSb2O6 and MnSb2O6 in acidic media was also examined so that their performances can be compared with previously reported non-stoichiometric CoSb2O6 and MnSb2O6 electrodes. The electrochemical properties and stabilities of stoichiometric, phase-pure CoSb2O6 and MnSb2O6 reported in this study can provide useful insights into the development and understanding of acid-stable, non-noble metal oxide-based OER catalysts.									17	1	0	0	0	0	17			2574-0962			WOS:000543715100052

For the first time, these newly developed Car SWCNTs were demonstrated to act as trifunctional metal-free catalysts for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), oxygen evolution reaction (OER), and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) over a wide range of pH values, from acid to alkaline, with even higher electrocatalytic activities and better long-term stabilities than those of commercial Pt and RuO2 counterparts. Thus, the adsorption-induced intermolecular charge-transfer with the C-60 electron-acceptor can provide a general approach to high-performance, metal-free, pH-universal carbon-based trifunctional metal-free electrocatalysts for water-splitting and beyond.									144	6	0	0	6	0	143			0002-7863	1520-5126		WOS:000477787400042	31241328

Herein, spinel Co3O4 nanomaterials were synthesized controllably with the specified morphologies of nanocubes, nanosheets, and nanoplates with different exposed planes of {100}, {110}, and {111}, respectively. The effects of the crystal planes of Co3O4 on the activity for the OER, ORR, and HER were subsequently investigated in alkaline media. Different electrocatalytic performances are possibly attributed to the abundance ratios of Co3+/Co2+ over the different exposed planes. The surface Co3+ ions exhibit higher activity for the OER and HER, whereas the surface Co2+ ions exhibit better performance for the ORR; moreover, higher electroconductivity enhances the polarization current for ORR and HER except OER.									36	4	0	0	1	0	38			2196-0216			WOS:000429413700012

Here, a simple yet cost-effective strategy is developed to produce heteroatom-doped carbon nanospheres using natural cuttlefish ink as the precursor. For the oxygen reduction reaction, the catalyst exhibits more positive onset-potential and larger diffusion limiting current density compared with benchmark platinum catalyst in alkaline medium. Moreover, the as synthesized catalyst shows low onset-potential for oxygen evolution reaction, indicating its outstanding catalytic activity. The catalyst shows a potential gap of 0.75 V between the oxygen evolution reaction potential at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) and the oxygen reduction reaction potential at the half-wave potential, outperforming most of other noble metal-free carbon catalysts in the current state of research. The remarkable catalytic performance can be assigned to heteroatoms doping, full exposure of the active sites, large surface area and enrichment of pores for sufficient contact and rapid transportation of the reactants. This study offers a new approach for the synthesis of metal-free carbon nanomaterials from natural resources, and broadens the design for the fabrication of bifunctional oxygen reduction and oxygen evolution catalysts.

Spontaneous Deposition of Iridium onto Nickel Substrates for the Oxygen Evolution Reaction								ELECTROCATALYSIS				7	3			226	234		10.1007/s12678-016-0299-9				MAY 2016	2016	Spontaneous deposition of Ir onto Ni substrates was investigated as a method to produce electrocatalytic layers for the oxygen evolution reaction in 30 % KOH solution. UV/Vis spectroscopy, cyclic voltammetry and other electrochemical methods are used to investigate the deposition process and the activity of the electrocatalytic coating towards the oxygen evolution reaction. From three solutions (IrCl3+HCl, H2IrCl6+HCl and H2IrCl6), H2IrCl6 is shown to give the most active and stable coating, with deposition times of 45 min at 60(a similar to)C enough to increase the activity of the Ni substrate for the oxygen evolution reaction. It is proposed that Ir deposition can occur via the reduction of the Ir precursor coupled to Ni oxidation, as well as the hydrolysis and localised precipitation of the Ir precursor due to the increase in surface pH during Ni dissolution.									9	0	0	0	0	0	9			1868-2529	1868-5994		WOS:000374259500005

Despite the well-recognized role of oxygen reaction kinetics on the viability of energy technologies, the governing mechanisms remain elusive and until now have been addressable only by macroscopic studies. This lack of nanoscale understanding precludes optimization of material architecture. Here, we report direct measurements of oxygen reduction/evolution reactions and oxygen vacancy diffusion on oxygen-ion conductive solid surfaces with sub-10 nm resolution. In electrochemical strain microscopy, the biased scanning probe microscopy tip acts as a moving, electrocatalytically active probe exploring local electrochemical activity. The probe concentrates an electric field in a nanometre-scale volume of material, and bias-induced, picometre-level surface displacements provide information on local electrochemical processes. Systematic mapping of oxygen activity on bare and platinum-functionalized yttria-stabilized zirconia surfaces is demonstrated. This approach allows direct visualization of the oxygen reduction/evolution reaction activation process at the triple-phase boundary, and can be extended to a broad spectrum of oxygen-conductive and electrocatalytic materials.									216	3	0	0	19	0	218			1755-4330	1755-4349		WOS:000294159300019	21860460

Perovskite oxides have been shown to be promising oxygen electrode catalysts because of their low cost, flexibility, and tailorable properties. In order to improve perovskite catalysts for the oxygen reduction (ORR) and oxygen evolution (OER) reactions, a better understanding of their reaction mechanisms is needed. This Perspective aims to inform researchers of the current proposed reaction mechanisms for ORR and OER on perovskites and perovskite/carbon composites in order to guide future catalyst development. Additionally, important experimental practices will be recommended. A recent development for OER is the lattice oxygen evolution reaction, which is a possible addition to the conventional four consecutive proton-coupled electron transfer mechanism. Carbon additives are consistently added to perovskites to enhance conductivity and ORR/OER activity. However, carbon plays an active role in ORR, and there is evidence of a synergistic relationship between perovskite and carbon in perovskite/carbon composites.									28	3	0	0	0	0	28			2155-5435			WOS:000626844200058

Superoxide dismutase mimetics (SODms), which suppress superoxide-triggered side reactions by accelerating the disproportionation reaction during discharge, are introduced as soluble additives in the LOBs. However, although SODms promote the disproportionation reaction, which is the main pathway for singlet oxygen evolution, the correlation between SODms and singlet oxygen has not been verified. Here, 4-carboxy-TEMPO is selected as a representative SODm that effectively promotes the disproportionation reaction and chemically verifies acceleration of singlet oxygen evolution. Furthermore, by using quencher, it is reported that the release of singlet oxygen evolved by the SODm is decreased. Because this study closely examines the relationship between the additives and singlet oxygen, it is believed that this study provides an important reference for the development of additives for the practical application of LOBs.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1616-301X	1616-3028		WOS:000865569400001

Controlled intensity modulated photo-current spectroscopy, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, and other electrochemical results indicate that the Rh on the perovskite provide an oxidation active site during the PEC water oxidation process by reducing the reaction energy barrier for water oxidation. Theoretical calculations indicate that the water oxidation reaction is more likely to occur on the (110) crystal plane of Rh-SrTiO3 because the oxygen evolution reaction overpotential on the (110) crystal plane is reduced significantly. Therefore, the obtained BiVO4/Rh5%-SrTiO3 photoanode exhibits an optimized PEC performance. In particular, it facilitates the saturation of the photocurrent density. Thus, the presence of doped Rh in SrTiO3 can reduce the amount of noble metals required while achieving excellent and stable oxygen evolution properties.									122	6	0	0	16	0	122			1616-301X	1616-3028		WOS:000484251200017

In this work, we initially report on a synthetic strategy that combines etching and ion-exchange processes to prepare ultrathin cobalt oxide nanosheets containing Co4+ ions. The presence of Co4+ ions makes Co-O bond more covalent, which is essential for adsorption of OH-, but also reduces the charge transfer resistance. Moreover, nanosheets thus prepared provided a large number of active sites for oxygen evolution reaction. Owing to these merits, these nanosheets exhibited an apparently superior activity towards oxygen evolution reaction, delivering an anodic current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at 1.57 V (vs RHE), about an order of magnitude higher than that of cobalt oxide nanosheets without Co4+ ions and bulk LiCoO2. Further, the repeated availability of the optimized nanosheets for oxygen evolution reaction is excellent: the overpotential at about 10 mA cm(-2) was retained in between 340 and 346 mV after continuous cycling for 5000 cycles.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			1867-3880	1867-3899		WOS:000449951500016

The performance is comparable to that of the state-of-the-art transition-metal, noble-metal, and non-metal catalysts. Remarkably, the flexible nature of these oxygen electrodes allows their use in folded and rolled-up forms, and directly as cathodes in Zn-air batteries, featuring low charge/discharge overpotential and long lifetime.									648	35	0	0	32	0	658			1433-7851	1521-3773		WOS:000352497600045	25522311

Surface modification is one of the most promising strategies for improving the activity of such electrocatalysts. Herein, we report the multilayer hollow MnCo2O4 microsphere enriched with oxygen vacancies induced by the plasma-engraving technique for the first time. The defective MnCo2O4 microsphere exhibits an excellent catalytic activity and durability as compared to pristine MnCo2O4. Our electrochemical analysis, combined with first-principles calculations, reveals that the improved electrocatalytic performance is attributed mainly to abundant active sites after the plasma treatment and the effects of the introduced oxygen vacancies. The oxygen vacancy not only reduces the density of states near the Fermi level but also lowers the Co d-band center, weakening the adsorption of the intermediates. This facilitates the desorption of the adsorbates, which is necessary for oxygen evolution reaction.									45	1	0	0	7	0	45			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000663711200004

The maximum OER/ORR current density is determined using a membrane electrode assembly representative of the membrane electrode assemblies in the fuel cells. Hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR) catalyst is platinum and OER catalyst is iridium oxide. USE - Methods for starting up fuel cell system such as automotive fuel system (claimed) from starting temperature below freezing point. ADVANTAGE - The current drawn is set so low so that drawn current is always safely sustained by electrolysis reactions at the anode OER catalyst, which prevents the damage to stack. The maximum OER/ORR current density of the cells increases as stack temperature increases, which allow greater current to be drawn without adverse effect to the cells in the stack. The significant current is sustained while cell undergoing fuel starvation, when operating in OER/ORR mode during voltage reversal. DETAILED DESCRIPTION - An INDEPENDENT CLAIM is included for a fuel system.

The superactivated surfaces exhibit a transient oxygen evolution response subsequent to monolayer oxidation and prior to extensive visible oxygen evolution. The kinetics of this oxygen evolution process are studied using a variety of transient and steady-state electrochemical techniques. The Tafel slope is shown to decrease with increased activation of the gold surface from ca. 120 to ca. 48 mV dec(-1), and the charge transfer kinetics are enhanced by over three orders of magnitude for the superactivated electrodes. A mechanistic scheme involving the formation of monomeric Au(III) hydroxyl complexes of the form Au(OH)(6) (3-) is proposed. The latter are of a transient nature and may be regarded as intermediates in the early stages of hydrous -oxide growth. These labile species may catalyse oxygen evolution by enhancing the formation of peroxy species that subsequently decompose with loss of oxygen gas from the surface oxide. This novel mechanistic route is in excellent agreement with recent literature studies and has the potential to unite a number of strands in the current understanding of the oxygen evolution reaction at gold surfaces.									31	1	0	0	0	0	32			1432-8488	1433-0768		WOS:000346173900007

First-row transition metal complexes are promising catalyst candidates due to their excellent electrocatalytic performance, rich abundance, and cheap price. Metalloporphyrins are a class of representative high-efficiency complex catalysts owing to their structural and functional characteristics. However, OER based on porphyrin systems previously have been paid little attention in comparison to the well-described oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), hydrogen evolution reaction, and CO2 reduction reaction. Recently, porphyrin-based systems, including both small molecules and porous polymers for electrochemical OER, are emerging. Accordingly, this review summarizes the recent advances of porphyrin-based systems for electrochemical OER. Firstly, the electrochemical OER for water oxidation is discussed, which shows various methodologies to achieve catalysis from homogeneous to heterogeneous processes. Subsequently, the porphyrin-based catalytic systems for bifunctional oxygen electrocatalysis including both OER and ORR are demonstrated. Finally, the future development of porphyrin-based catalytic systems for electrochemical OER is briefly prospected.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2				1422-0067		WOS:000809129900001	35682721

A nanocomposite CoO-NiO-NiCo bifunctional electrocatalyst supported by nitrogen-doped multiwall carbon nanotubes (NCNT/CoO-NiO-NiCo) exhibits excellent activity and stability for the ORR/OER in alkaline media. More importantly, real air cathodes made from the bifunctional NCNT/CoO-NiO-NiCo catalysts further demonstrated superior performance to state-of-the-art Pt/C or Pt/C+IrO2 catalysts in primary and rechargeable zinc-air batteries.									312	13	0	0	16	0	314			1433-7851	1521-3773		WOS:000358987300039	26118973

The obtained nanolayers were characterized by SEM, XRD, FTIR and XPS spectroscopy. The electrochemical properties of the electrodes were defined from polarization curves. SEM images revealed that nanolayers are formed by nanosheets with a thickness of 6 - 10 nm. The nanolayers were shown to exhibit electrocatalytic properties during the oxygen evolution reaction upon water splitting in the alkaline medium. By setting the number of SILD cycles, these properties can be changed precisely. For a number of samples, synthesized after 30 - 120 SILD cycles, it was found that in the oxygen evolution reaction the lowest overpotential value of 260 mV and the lowest Tafel slope of 54 mV/dec are achieved for the sample, synthesized after 90 SILD cycles.									6	0	2	0	0	0	6			2220-8054	2305-7971		WOS:000454046400011

But the surface charge reaction is less studied quantitatively. More difficultly, the verification methods for new multiple-step photocatalytic reactions are rarely found, which could be one of the main reasons for the insufficient reaction mechanism study. In this work, we aim to elucidate the rate-law relationship of the multiple-charge reactions, which is derived based on the microkinetics calculation on the photophysical redox reactions using pre-equilibrium approximation and steady-state approximation. The numerical analysis demonstrates that an nth-order feature could be observed when the nth-step is a rate-determined step in a multiple-step reaction. Likely, the 4th-order charge transfer could be possibly found for oxygen evolution reaction, suggesting the analytical methods and results could further boost the fundamental studies in photocatalysts and multiple-step reactions.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1011-372X	1572-879X		WOS:000765238800001

Recent studies show that oxygen from the perovskite oxide lattice could participate in the OER via a lattice oxygen-mediated mechanism, providing possibilities for the development of alternative electrocatalysts that could overcome the scaling relations-induced limitations found in conventional catalysts utilizing the adsorbate evolution mechanism. Here we distinguish the extent to which the participation of lattice oxygen can contribute to the OER through the rational design of a model system of silicon-incorporated strontium cobaltite perovskite electrocatalysts with similar surface transition metal properties yet different oxygen diffusion rates. The as-derived silicon-incorporated perovskite exhibits a 12.8-fold increase in oxygen diffusivity, which matches well with the 10-fold improvement of intrinsic OER activity, suggesting that the observed activity increase is dominantly a result of the enhanced lattice oxygen participation. While water splitting provides a renewable means to store energy, the sluggish O-2 evolution half-reaction limits applications. Here, authors examine a silicon-incorporated strontium cobaltite perovskite and correlate lattice oxygen participation in O-2 evolution to the oxygen ion diffusivity.									193	5	0	0	17	0	192			2041-1723			WOS:000558820800020	32332731

The adsorption energy scaling relations between the reaction intermediates, however, impose a large intrinsic overpotential and sluggish reaction kinetics on OER catalysts. Developing advanced electrocatalysts with high activity and stability based on non-noble metal materials is still a grand challenge. Central to the rational design of novel and high-efficiency catalysts is the development and understanding of quantitative structure-activity relationships, which correlate the catalytic activities with structural and electronic descriptors. This paper comprehensively reviews the benchmark descriptors for OER electrolysis, aiming to give an in-depth understanding on the origins of the electrocatalytic activity of the OER and further contribute to building the theory of electrocatalysis. Meanwhile, the cutting-edge research frontiers for proposing new OER paradigms and crucial strategies to circumvent the scaling relationship are also summarized. Challenges, opportunities and perspectives are discussed, intending to shed some light on the rational design concepts and advance the development of more efficient catalysts for enhancing OER performance.									4	0	0	0	0	0	3			2311-6706	2150-5551		WOS:000788598500002	35482112

Understanding the origins of the lattice oxygen oxidation mechanism is crucial because OER catalysts operating via this mechanism could bypass certain limitations associated with those operating by the conventional adsorbate evolution mechanism. Transition metal oxyhydroxides are often considered to be the real catalytic species in a variety of OER catalysts and their low-dimensional layered structures readily allow direct formation of the O-O bond. Here, we incorporate catalytically inactive Zn2+ into CoOOH and suggest that the OER mechanism is dependent on the amount of Zn2+ in the catalyst. The inclusion of the Zn2+ ions gives rise to oxygen non-bonding states with different local configurations that depend on the quantity of Zn2+. We propose that the OER proceeds via the lattice oxygen oxidation mechanism pathway on the metal oxyhydroxides only if two neighbouring oxidized oxygens can hybridize their oxygen holes without sacrificing metal-oxygen hybridization significantly, finding that Zn0.2Co0.8OOH has the optimum activity.									569	31	0	0	50	0	573			2058-7546			WOS:000464231500017

The obtained monometallic samples were physically mixed in different ratios to assess the importance of each phthalocyanine. The increase of FePc content enhanced the electroactivity towards the oxygen reduction reaction, especially the limiting current density and reaction mechanism, for which two relationships were found by varying the CoPc:FePc mass ratio. Samples with a mass ratio (FePc:CoPc) >= 1 surpassed the electroactivity of the current commercial electrocatalyst (Pt/C) and presented similarly high long-term durability (82-85%). Interestingly, a synergetic effect between both types of metallic active centers was observed for the oxygen evolution reaction. A 1:1 CoPc:FePc mass ratio provided the highest oxygen evolution reaction electroactivity, displaying a potential of 1.67 V at 10 mA cm(-2), higher than that of the commercial RuO2 catalyst (1.58 V). This sample also presented the lowest potential gap (0.81 V), which is much lower than that of Pt/C (1.20 V) and RuO2 (1.41 V), demonstrating the high potential of these materials as substitutes of noble metal electrocatalysts.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000729959700005

In light of this, we firstly report an advanced catalyst with both FeP and Fe3O4 nanoparticles embedded in N,P-doped microporous carbon nanofibers obtained by electrospinning. The resultant catalyst exhibits robust catalytic activities towards oxygen reduction reaction, hydrogen evolution reaction and oxygen evolution reaction, all of which surpass or are comparable to previously reported tri-functional catalysts. The Fe3O4 nanoparticles and N-doped carbon are the main active species toward oxygen reduction reaction and oxygen evolution reaction, while FeP nanoparticles remarkably promote the hydrogen evolution reaction.

Recently, cobalt sulfide materials have been widely explored as great choice in highly efficient electrocatalysts due to their good electrical conductivity and bi-functionality toward OER and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). However, cobalt sulfide shows outstanding HER activity, but its OER activity should be improved. Herein, hexagonal-phase cobalt sulfide (CoS) nano-wires with abundant stepped surfaces and defect sites were prepared via a seed-growth approach with silver sulfide (Ag2S) nanoparticles. The Ag2S-CoS hetero-nanowires (HNWs) exhibited excellent electrochemical performances for oxygen evolution reaction (overpotential = 275 mV, Tafel slope = 77.1 mVdec(-1), charge transfer resistance = 1.3 Omega) in 1.0 M KOH solution. The origin of superior activity was investigated using a combined experimental and theoretical approach.

Seeking active, stable, and cost-effective OER catalysts in acidic media is therefore of great significance. In this perspective, studying the reaction mechanism and exploiting advanced anode catalysts are of equal importance, where the former provides guidance for material structural engineering towards a better catalytic activity. In this review, we first summarize the currently proposed OER catalytic mechanisms,i.e., the adsorbate evolution mechanism (AEM) and lattice oxygen evolution reaction (LOER). Subsequently, we critically review several acidic OER electrocatalysts reported recently, with focus on structure-performance correlation.

Therefore, novel energy-conversion devices with high energy density and environmental friendliness are expected to provide reliable alternatives to traditional fossil-based energy systems. However, because of the inevitable use of costly precious metals as the electrode catalysts for such devices, their popularization is seriously hindered. Transition metal nitrides (TMNs) exhibit similar surface and adsorption properties to noble metals because the atomic distance between metal atoms increases and the d-band center of metal atoms downshifts after nitrogen atoms enter the metal lattice. TMNs have become one of the best electrode materials to replace noble metal-based electrocatalysts in next-generation energy-storage and energy-conversion devices. In this review, the recent developments in the electrocatalytic application of TMNs are covered. First, we discuss the structure and activity origin of TMNs and introduce the common synthesis methods for the preparation of TMNs. Subsequently, we illustrate the applications of mono-metallic TMNs and multi-metallic TMNs in oxygen-reduction reaction, oxygen-evolution reaction, and bifunctional oxygen reduction and evolution reactions. Finally, we summarize the challenges of TMNs encountered at the present stage, and expect their future development.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1				2079-4991		WOS:000839783800001	35957091

It is discovered that the manganese quadruple perovskites CaMn7O12 and LaMn7O12 show bifunctional catalysis in the OER/ORR.

Despite tremendous efforts, developing efficient bifunctional electrocatalysts with low cost and long-term durability remains a great challenge. Herein, the synthesis of Co9S8 nanocrystals encapsulated in nitrogen/sulfur-doped mesoporous graphitized carbon derived from a polymer-metal complex is reported, which exhibit similar electrocatalytic activity and superior stability for water-splitting reactions (oxygen reduction/oxygen evolution). The remarkable electrochemical properties are mainly attributed to the synergetic effects between Co9S8, heteroatoms and graphitized carbon in alkaline medium, especially for the oxygen evolution reaction. The present strategy to fabricate Co9S8 nanocrystals in nitrogen and sulfur doped carbon using a single-source precursor offers many prospects in developing highly effective electrocatalysts in rechargeable metal-air batteries.									24	2	0	0	1	0	24			2196-0216			WOS:000422673500020

It is a ubiquitous problem about how to control the motion of oxygen bubbles released by the reaction. Here we show that oxygen bubbles during oxygen evolution reaction exhibit a variety of movement patterns in the magnetic field, including directional migration and rotational motion of oxygen bubbles when the magnet in parallel with the electrode, and exclusion movement of oxygen bubbles when the magnet perpendicular to the electrode. The results demonstrate that the direction of oxygen bubbles movement is dependent upon the magnet pole near the electrode, and the kinetics of oxygen bubbles is mainly proportional to intensity of the electromagnetic field. The magnetic-field induced rotational motion of oxygen bubbles in a square electrolyzer can increase liquid hydrodynamics, thus solve the problems of oxygen bubbles coalescence, and uneven distribution of electrolyte composition and temperature. These types of oxygen bubbles movement will not only improve energy saving and metal deposition for energy storage and metal refinery, but also propel object motion in application to medical and martial fields.									11	1	0	0	2	0	11			2045-2322			WOS:000369928400002	26867515

Free energies of the reaction intermediates (RIs) including the chemical nature of active surface sites (S) are hardly accessible to experiment and need therefore to be taken from constrained ab initio thermodynamics calculations. The compact compilation of experimental kinetic data in the form of a free energy diagram enables a critical assessment and validation of theoretical free energy landscapes based on first-principles kinetics. For three prototypical electrocatalyzed reactions, namely the chlorine evolution reaction (CER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) over RuO2(110) as well as hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) on Pt(111), we exemplify this universal approach and discuss potential benefits for theoretical modeling of electrocatalyzed reaction.									88	3	0	0	4	0	90			2155-5435			WOS:000426804100031

The reaction conditions affecting the oxygen evolution rate, i.e. anion, Fe3+ concentration, pH, Fe3+/Fe2+ equilibrium concentration and dependence of irradiation wavelength, were investigated. The reaction rate increased with increase of both the Fe3+ ion concentration and the solution pH. Oxygen evolution ceased at an Fe3+:Fe2+ ion concentration ratio of 3:7-4:6. The reaction rate decreased rapidly for longer-wavelength irradiation (above around 400 nm), which is considerably shorter than the alpha-Fe2O3 bandgap of ca. 600 nm (2.1 eV).									135	8	0	0	5	0	136			1463-9076			WOS:000088407700023

Enormous attempts have previously been devoted in non-noble electrocatalysts born out of metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) for ORR, OER, and HER applications, due to the following advantageous reasons: (i) The significant porosity eases the electrolyte diffusion; (ii) the supreme catalyst-electrolyte contact area enhances the diffusion efficiency; and (iii) the electronic conductivity can be extensively increased owing to the unique construction block subunits for MOFs-derived electrocatalysis. Herein, the recent progress of MOFs-derived electrocatalysts including synthesis protocols, design engineering, DFT calculations roles, and energy applications is discussed and reviewed. It can be concluded that the elevated ORR, OER, and HER performances are attributed to an advantageously well-designed high-porosity structure, significant surface area, and plentiful active centers. Furthermore, the perspectives of MOF-derived electrocatalysts for the ORR, OER, and HER are presented.									46	0	0	0	0	0	46			2311-6706	2150-5551		WOS:000656872300001	34138365

It is highly desirable to achieve the efficient integration of dual active components into the catalysts and to understand the interaction between the dual components. Here, a facile approach is demonstrated to construct defective carbon-CoP nanoparticle hybrids as bifunctional oxygen electrocatalysts, and further probe the interfacial charge distribution behavior. By combining multiple synchrotron-based X-ray spectroscopic characterizations with density functional theory calculations, the interfacial charge polarization with the electrons gathering at the defective carbon surface and the holes gathering at the CoP surface due to strong interfacial coupling is revealed, which simultaneously facilitates the ORR and OER with remarkable bifunctional oxygen electrode activities. This work not only offers a bifunctional oxygen catalyst with outstanding performance, but also unravels the promoting factor of the hybrids from the view of interfacial charge distribution.									190	18	0	0	7	0	191			1614-6832	1614-6840		WOS:000436103300017

The synthesized samples have been characterized by Powder X-ray diffraction, Raman spectroscopy, Scanning Electron Microscopy, Energy Dispersive X-ray Spectrometry, Elemental Mapping, UV-Vis spectrophotometry andN(2)-adsorption Isotherm. The photoelectrochemical properties for oxygen evolution reaction and hydrogen evolution reaction have been studied by Cyclic voltammetry and Linear sweep voltammetry analysis in 2 M aq. KOH electrolyte and stability for constant current generation of these samples is observed by Chronoamperometric measurements. These studies indicate that metal oxide nanoparticles have been successfully incorporated into MIL-125(Ti), which enhance the efficient absorption of visible light and improve the oxygen evolution and hydrogen evolution reaction activity during water splitting. Furthermore, from linear sweep voltammetry results at 1mVs(-1) scan rate it is observed that MxOy@MIL-125(Ti) samples have lower onset potential and higher current density as compared to pure MIL-125(Ti). CuO@MIL-125(Ti)/NF exhibited highest current density, lowest onset potential and better oxygen evolution reaction and hydrogen evolution reaction activity as compared to all other synthesized samples.									14	1	0	0	1	0	14			2365-6549			WOS:000479139200020

Here, by studying fundamental links between the activity and stability of well-characterized monometallic and bimetallic oxides, we found that there is generally an inverse relationship between activity and stability. To overcome this limitation, we developed a new synthesis strategy that is based on tuning the near-surface composition of Ru and Ir elements by surface segregation, thereby resulting in the formation of a nanosegregated domain that balances the stability and activity of surface atoms. We demonstrate that a Ru0.5Ir0.5 alloy synthesized by using this method exhibits four-times higher stability than the best Ru-Ir oxygen evolution reaction materials, while still preserving the same activity.									278	9	0	0	14	0	282			1433-7851	1521-3773		WOS:000346484400006	25297010

Nowadays one can preferably design electrocatalysts based on the deep theoretical knowledge of electronic structures, via computer-guided engineering of the surface and (electro)chemical properties of materials, followed by the synthesis of practical materials with high performance for specific reactions. This review provides insights into both theoretical and experimental electrochemistry toward a better understanding of a series of key clean energy conversion reactions including oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), oxygen evolution reaction (OER), and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). The emphasis of this review is on the origin of the electrocatalytic activity of nanostructured catalysts toward the aforementioned reactions by correlating the apparent electrode performance with their intrinsic electrochemical properties.

It is well known that both PEM fuel cells and water electrolysers' electrodes often contain significant amounts of nanostructured Pt or other types of noble metal particles. These materials provide the superior catalytic activity of electrochemical reactions such as OER (oxygen evolution reaction), HER (hydrogen evolution reaction) and ORR (oxygen reduction reaction). The trace amounts of phenolic substances contained in air or water could be harmful (when in contact with a fuel cell/water electrolyser's working environment) to the abovementioned catalytic surfaces. Hence, they could potentially have severe detrimental effects on the kinetics of these processes. The results obtained in this work provided evidence for the detrimental role of Pt surface-adsorbed resorcinol molecules (or their electrodegradation products) on the kinetics of UPD of H and the oxygen evolution reaction. The above was revealed through evaluation of the associated charge-transfer resistance and capacitance parameters, comparatively derived on a platinum electrode, for the initial and the resorcinol-modified H2SO4 electrolyte.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0				1996-1073		WOS:000759173700001

Herein, we report an Ag-1/IrOx single atom catalyst (SAC) with Ag single atoms embedded in an IrO2 matrix obtained through the oxidation of IrAg single atom alloy (SAA). The Ag-1/IrOx SAC delivers a low overpotential of 224 mV at current density of 10 mA cm(-2) and a long-term durability better than that of commercial Ir (C-Ir). DFT calculation indicates that six Ir atoms neighboring the single Ag atom exhibit a higher-valence Irx+ (x > 4) and thus lower the adsorption free energy significantly to boost the oxygen evolution process. Furthermore, the strong Ir-O bonds and low overpotential prevent the loss of the lattice oxygen in the Ag-1/IrOx SAC, resulting in high oxygen evolution reaction stability.									22	2	0	0	2	0	22			2380-8195			WOS:000639063800039

In this work, the performance of alpha-MnO2(001) and Mo doped alpha-MnO2(001) electrocatalytic oxygen evolution reaction were studied by using density functional theory. Gibbs free energy, density of states and differential charge density were calculated according to the reaction path. The research results show that Mo doping can effectively modulate the electronic structure of alpha-MnO2(001) surface, improve desorption and adsorption capacity between intermediates and the catalyst, and provide more electrons for OER. Gibbs free energy calculation results indicate that the formation of O-2 from *OOH is the rate-determining step for OER in the Mo doped alpha-MnO2(001) system. Mo doping reduces the overpotential to 1.01 V, which presents a good catalytic performance for oxygen evolution.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1000-324X			WOS:000817167900010

One of the challenges in the area of electrocatalysis is to find an effective catalyst that will reduce, as well as generate, oxygen at moderate temperatures. The enhanced electrocatalytic properties and stability in acid of the GO-MOF composite is due to the unqiue porous scaffold structure, improved charge transport and synergistic interactions between the GO and MOF. In polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cell testing, the GO-incorporated Cu-MOF composite delivers a power density that is 76% that of the commercial Pt catalyst.									698	31	0	0	42	1	710			1616-301X	1616-3028		WOS:000327472900006

Herein, solid NiMoO4 nanoplate arrays were used as cages to immobilize the metal source, and Mo doped NiSx is obtained by in situ solvothermal sulfuration reaction with polysulfide as the sulfur source. The electronic structure, conductivity, crystallographic phase and microscopic morphology of oxygen evolution catalysts could be controlled simultaneously by polysulfide induced solid metal oxide sulfidation, thereby greatly improving their electrocatalytic oxygen evolution activity. Benefiting from these, the prepared Mo doped nickel-sulfur electrodes show great performance toward the oxygen evolution reaction with overpotentials of 184 mV and 240 mV at current densities of 50 and 100 mA cm(-2) in alkaline electrolyte.

In this study, a phosphorus doped carbon nanotube (P-CNT) is facilely synthesized via a one-step process and in-situ solvothermal method. The electrocatalytic activity for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction(OER) of the catalyst was studied with the rotating ring-disk electrode (RRDE) technique. The doping of phosphorus can obviously improve the electrocatalytic activity of CNT towards both the ORR and OER. Four electron reduction pathway is dominant on P-CNT during the ORR process, which is comparable to the commercial Pt/C (20 wt%). The electrocatalytic activity of P-CNT towards the OER is superior to that of Pt/C (20 wt%). Moreover, the long-term stability of P-CNT outperforms that of Pt/C (20 wt%). The high electrocatalytic activity and long-term stability of P-CNT are attributed to P-doping in CNT and the strong coupling between phosphorus and carbon.			对氧气还原(ORR)和氧气析出(OER)反应都具有催化活性的双功能催化剂在金属-空气电池中起着关键作用. 本文通过溶剂热反应, 一步原位合成了磷掺杂碳纳米管(P-CNT).旋转环盘电极测试表明磷掺杂能够明显提高碳纳米管的催化活性, P-CNT 在碱性电解质中对 ORR 和OER 都具有优异的催化活性. P-CNT 对ORR 的催化还原为近4电子反应, 可与商业催化剂Pt/C(20 wt%)相比; 而其对OER 的催化活性则高于Pt/C (20 wt%). 此外, P-CNT 的长期稳定性优于Pt/C (20 wt%). P-CNT 对ORR 和OER 的高催化活性和稳定性主要归因于磷对碳的掺杂以及磷与碳间强的化学键合.						1	1	0	0	0	0	1			1674-7224			CSCD:5217602

The electrochemical investigations showed that the presence of lower levels of oxygen and higher levels of chloride, as in Sr4Fe3O8Cl2 and Sr2FeO2Cl2 significantly enhanced the oxygen evolution and reduction over the other perovskitic oxides. Additionally, Sr4Fe3O8Cl2 and Sr2FeO2Cl2 was proven to have high bi-functional activity due to an overpotential gap (Delta E = 0.70 V) between the OER and ORR much lower than that of other similar perovskite bi-functional catalysts. In comparison with other strontium iron oxyhalide based electrocatalysts, Sr2FeO2Cl2 was shown to have higher OER activities among all investigated catalysts. This work demonstrates that the oxygen-deficient layered perovskites of the type A(2)BO(2)X(2) are a new class of high-performance electrocatalysts for oxygen evolution (OE) and oxygen reduction (OR) reactions in alkaline media.

Recent theoretical calculations and experimental investigations reveal that the energy loss in ORR/OER is closely related to the triplet O-2 generation/conversion step. However, the spin-related phenomena have long been neglected in understanding of the ORR/OER mechanism. This review highlights recent advances in understanding and application of the spin-related effect in oxygen electrocatalysis. It is demonstrated that the exchange interaction in magnetic catalysts can build a spin-selective channel to filter the electron spins with appropriate orientation in the O-2 generation/conversion step during ORR/OER. It is believed that the introduction of spin effect can establish a more comprehensive understanding of oxygen electrocatalysis and assist designing more reactive oxygen electrocatalysts.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			2699-9412			WOS:000783860800006

It was recently demonstrated for many transition-metal oxides that stability of a catalyst can suffer from the active participation of lattice oxygen atoms in the OER. In this work, we combine density functional theory-based thermodynamics and molecular dynamics to analyze the OER activity of a series of Ir-bearing oxides. We reveal that although some Ir oxides exhibit thermodynamic overpotentials lower than that of the state-of-the-art IrO2 rutile for the conventional reaction pathway, they also feature concomitant activation of lattice oxygen atoms toward the OER. By focusing on a few representative cases we unequivocally demonstrate that the lattice oxygen mechanism can outperform the conventional mechanism owing to its lower kinetic barriers. As lattice oxygen evolution was experimentally correlated with oxide degradation, enhanced OER activity due to involvement of lattice oxygen should compromise materials stability. This study highlights the importance of considering the lattice oxygen evolution reaction for more reliable computational predictions of electrochemically stable OER catalysts.									24	1	0	0	1	0	24			2380-8195			WOS:000629230800032

Here, the synthesis of hollow PtNi nanostrings via a facile two-step template method is reported. The PtNi nanostrings own Pt-rich rough surfaces, and hollow string-like structure with the structural disorder morphology. Impressively, the unique hollow PtNi nanostrings exhibit excellent electrocatalytic activity toward the hydrogen evolution and oxygen reduction reactions. The obtained overpotential is only 44.60 mV at current density of 10 mA cm(-2) for hydrogen evolution reaction. Furthermore, the hollow PtNi nanostrings exhibit a high mass activity of 2.5 A mg(Pt)(-1) and a superior specific activity of 3.89 mA cm(-2) at 0.90 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode in oxygen reduction reaction, respectively, which are 10 and 9 times higher than those of the commercial Pt/C. This work provides a promising approach for the synthesis of highly bifunctional electrocatalysts with a hollow sting-like structure to promote their application in the hydrogen evolution and oxygen reduction reactions.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			1533-4880	1533-4899		WOS:000484777500062	31383121

Analysis of transient characteristics for zinc-nickel single flow battery considering side reactions								INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ELECTROCHEMICAL SCIENCE				16	2					210215	10.20964/2021.02.15				FEB 2021	2021	A two-dimensional transient model of zinc-nickel single flow battery considering side reaction is developed and is used to study the effects of concentration, flow rate and applied current density on the side reaction. The results indicate that the generation of oxygen in the positive electrode is mainly at the end of charging, the generation of hydrogen in the negative electrode starts at the beginning of charging. As time goes on, the hydrogen evolution side reaction gradually weakens. The amount of hydrogen produced during charging is much less than that of oxygen. Decreasing the initial hydroxide ions concentration within a certain range can effectively inhibit the oxygen evolution side reaction, but it will aggravate the hydrogen evolution side reaction. Reducing the initial concentration of zincate ions has little effect on the oxygen evolution side reaction, but it will aggravate the hydrogen evolution side reaction. The effect of zincate ions on hydrogen evolution reaction is much smaller than that of hydroxide ions. The increase of the electrolyte flow rate reduces concentration polarization and has inhibitory effect on the side reaction of the battery electrode. Increasing the applied current density within a certain range will aggravate the side reaction of the battery electrode.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			1452-3981			WOS:000620082300007

To better understand the origin of these oxygen electrocatalytic activities, we survey physical-chemical trends in the perovskites and their relations to the ORR activity, from which we postulate the role of the electronic states in stabilizing the reaction intermediates and facilitating oxygen charge transfer. Our finding supports the role of the electronic states in governing the metaloxygen bond strength and the degree of mixing between the metal and the oxygen states as the underlying physical-chemical properties that control the activities of the perovskite oxides for oxygen electrocatalysis.					13th Polymer Electrolyte Fuel Cell Symposium (PEFC)13th Polymer Electrolyte Fuel Cell Symposium (PEFC)	OCT 27-NOV 01, 2013OCT 27-NOV 01, 2013	Electrochem Soc; Electrochem Soc, Ind Electrochemistry & Electrochem Engn Div; Electrochem Soc, Battery Div; Electrochem Soc, Corros Div; Electrochem Soc, Energy Technol Div; Electrochem Soc, Phys & Analyt Electrochemistry Div; N E Chemcat CorpElectrochem Soc; Electrochem Soc, Ind Electrochemistry & Electrochem Engn Div; Electrochem Soc, Battery Div; Electrochem Soc, Corros Div; Electrochem Soc, Energy Technol Div; Electrochem Soc, Phys & Analyt Electrochemistry Div; N E Chemcat Corp	San Francisco, CASan Francisco, CA	15	1	0	0	0	0	16			1938-5862		978-1-60768-446-6; 978-1-60768-445-9	WOS:000354475600071

It is urgent to develop efficient catalysts for OER in acidic media. At present, Ru-based catalysts have high activity, but their poor stability makes them difficult to be used in acidic oxygen evolution reactions. The involvement of lattice oxygen mechanism (LOM) in the reaction is one of the main causes of instability in Rubased catalysts. Herein, we synthesized SrRu0.5Ir0.5O3 double perovskite by doping Ir into SrRuO3. The double perovskite displays an extraordinary OER performance with a low overpotential of 185 mV at 10 mA cm-2 current density and maintains its catalytic stability for over 50 h in 0.5 M H2SO4. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy results show that the electronic synergistic effect between Ir and Ru enables the double perovskite materials with high activity. Meanwhile, the double perovskite catalyst inhibits the occurrence of the lattice oxygen mechanism during the OER, which greatly improve the catalytic stability of Ru-based perovskite materials.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000863312800005

J	Exner, Kai S.								Controlling Stability and Selectivity in the Competing Chlorine and Oxygen Evolution Reaction over Transition Metal Oxide Electrodes								CHEMELECTROCHEM				6	13			3401	3409		10.1002/celc.201900834				JUL 1 2019	2019	Chlor-alkali electrolysis is a large-scale industrial process, where the evolution of gaseous chlorine (chlorine evolution reaction, CER) at the anode is accompanied by a selectivity problem as the evolution of gaseous oxygen (oxygen evolution reaction, OER) constitutes an undesirable side reaction, which diminishes chlorine selectivity. The active component in the anode material is RuO2 with the (110) facet as most stable surface termination, for which the elementary reaction steps on an atomic scale of the competing CER and OER are already resolved. Here, the selectivity issue and the stability range of a RuO2(110) electrode are explored under CER/OER conditions by combining the kinetic description with surface Pourbaix diagrams and linear scaling relationships. These investigations directly merge into a advanced material screening approach, indicating that the free energy difference between the limiting OOH (OER) and OCl (CER) adsorbate is reconciled as a measure for stability and CER selectivity. This finding supports computational researchers within their search of improved electrode materials based on transition metal oxides for electrocatalytic chlorine formation.									29	3	0	0	4	0	32			2196-0216			WOS:000475512500023

Among numerous inorganic materials, CeO2-based electrocatalysts with flexible transform between Ce3+ and Ce4+ states and the abundant oxygen vacancies become one of the most promising candidates. This review summarizes the recent development in the synthetic strategy of CeO2-based nanomaterials and their applications in several representative electrochemical reactions, such as hydrogen evolution reaction, oxygen evolution reaction, hydrogen oxidation reaction, organic molecular oxidation reaction, oxygen reduction reaction, N2 reduction reaction and CO2 reduction reaction in liquid-phase electrolyte. By virtue of advanced characterization techniques and computational studies based on density functional theory (DFT), the detailed effects of CeO2 on these reactions and the specific mechanism to improve the catalytic efficiency are discussed and analyzed as well. In parallel, some strategies and procedure are proposed for the design and synthesis of CeO2-based electrocatalysts to achieve better catalytic performance. Finally, several challenges and perspectives in this emerging research area are proposed.

Considerable effort has been made on the fundamental understandings of the reaction mechanisms of OER. Recently, the attention has been given to the OER on magnetic catalysts, which is believed being able to promote the kinetics of an OER process from singlet reactants to triplet oxygen. The process in principle involves spin selective electron transfer. Here, we discuss the effects of spin in OER based on the recent advances and summarize our recently proposed mechanisms of the OER in spin-sensitive pathways under the lattice oxygen oxidation mechanism, the interaction of two M-O entity mechanism, and the adsorbate evolution									7	0	0	0	1	0	6			2451-9103			WOS:000704353800028

In the alkaline electrolyte, small overpotentials of 280 mV to drive 10 mA cm(-2) were required, much smaller than that of NiCo phosphide and NiCo precursor. The improved performance was attributed to the increased electrochemical surface area that exposed more active sites. The high electrocatalytic efficiency of the active sites was also in line with the enhanced specific activity and turnover frequency values. In addition, high catalytic stability was also observed.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1566-7367	1873-3905		WOS:000821310900006

Earth-abundant transition metal oxide-based catalysts are particularly active for oxygen evolution reaction; however, they are generally considered inactive toward hydrogen evolution reaction. Here, we show that strain engineering of the outermost surface of cobalt(II) oxide nanorods can turn them into efficient electrocatalysts for the hydrogen evolution reaction. They are competitive with the best electrocatalysts for this reaction in alkaline media so far. Our theoretical and experimental results demonstrate that the tensile strain strongly couples the atomic, electronic structure properties and the activity of the cobalt(II) oxide surface, which results in the creation of a large quantity of oxygen vacancies that facilitate water dissociation, and fine tunes the electronic structure to weaken hydrogen adsorption toward the optimum region.									296	19	0	0	15	0	297			2041-1723			WOS:000415262100010	29138406

Accelerating the conversion efficiencies of these systems requires the development of highly efficient electrocatalysts and the appropriate selection of electrolytes and conversion parameters. Porous metal oxides are a novel emergent class of electrocatalysts that are currently attracting wider attention for energy conversion applications. This study presents recent advancements in porous metal oxide (MO) electrocatalysts for different energy conversion technologies. Distinctly, it begins with discussions of the evolution of porous material sciences and atomic arrangements followed by the importance of oxides in electrocatalysis. A brief overview of the synthesis and different analytical techniques for porous metal oxides, and various experimental parameters for evaluating the performance of these electrocatalysts are provided. Recent progress in HER, OER, ORR, and CO2RR with their corresponding fundamental concepts, mechanisms, electrocatalytic performances, key challenges, and prospects were given for each category of energy conversion unlike the previous studies. This study further highlighted some critical roles of oxygen defects in metal oxide electrocatalysts and to bridge the knowledge gaps of previous reviews, the commendations on selecting techniques for energy conversion are also discussed. Conclusively, some vital outlooks for the advancement of the field toward industrial realization were discussed. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V.

To investigate both reactions and the origin of the catalytic sites, four synthesis methods were employed to prepare hexagonal Fe2N type Mo2C. A comparison of the HER activities in acidic and alkaline electrolyte and OER activities in alkaline electrolyte revealed that changes in synthesis route leads to morphological and surface composition variations resulting in different catalytic activities. In general, the trend in HER and OER activities show remarkably similar trends across the carbides synthesized via different routes irrespective of either electrolyte employed or reaction probed for electrocatalytic activities. Mo2C templated on multiwalled carbon nanotubes demonstrated the highest bifunctional catalytic activities, as well as superior electrochemical stability for both HER and OER.									44	2	1	0	0	0	45			1867-3880	1867-3899		WOS:000366837000016
