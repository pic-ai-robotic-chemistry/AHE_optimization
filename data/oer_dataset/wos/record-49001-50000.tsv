Previous applications of the Mo isotope paleo-ocean redox proxy assumed quantitative scavenging of Mo when buried into sulfidic sediments. This paper contains the first complete suite of Mo isotope fractionation observations in a sulfidic water column and sediment system, the meromictic Lake Cadagno, Switzerland, a small alpine lake with a pronounced oxygen-sulfide transition reaching up to H2S similar to 200 mu M in the bottom waters (or about 300 mu M total sulfide: Sigma S2- = H2S + HS- + S2-). We find that Mo behaves conservatively in the oxic zone and non-conservatively in the sulfidic zone, where dissolved Mo concentrations decrease from 14 nM to 2-8 nM across this transition. Dissolved Mo in the upper oxic waters has a delta Mo-98(oxic) = 0.9 +/- 0.1 parts per thousand, which matches that of the riverine input, delta Mo-98(river) = 0.9 +/- 0.1 parts per thousand. In the deeper sulfidic waters, a subaquatic source delivers Mo at 1.55 +/- 0.1 parts per thousand, but the dissolved Mo is even heavier at delta Mo-98(sulfidic) = 1.8 parts per thousand. Sediment traps in the sulfidic zone of the lake collect particles increasingly enriched in Mo with depth, with delta Mo-98 values significantly fractionated at -0.8 parts per thousand to -1.2 parts per thousand both near the chemocline and in the deepest trap. Suspended particulates in the sulfidic waters carry lighter Mo than the ambient dissolved Mo pool by similar to 0.3-1.5 parts per thousand. Sedimentary Mo concentrations correlate with total organic carbon and yield Mo levels which are two orders of magnitude higher than typical crustal values found in rocks from the catchment area. Solid-phase Mo in the sediment shows a slightly positive delta Mo-98 trend with depth, from delta Mo-98 = 1.2 parts per thousand to 1.4 parts per thousand while the pore waters show dramatic enrichments of Mo (>2000 nM) with a relatively light isotope signature of delta Mo-98 = 0.9-1.0 parts per thousand.These data are explained if Mo is converted to particle-reactive oxythiomolybdates in the sulfidic waters and is fractionated during removal from solution onto particles. Isotope fractionation is expressed in the water column, despite the high sulfide concentrations, because the rate of Mo removal is fast compared to the slow reaction kinetics of thiomolybdate formation. However, elemental and isotopic mass balances show that Mo is indeed quantitatively removed to the lake sediments and thus the isotopic composition of the sediments reflects sources to the sulfidic water. This efficient Mo drawdown is expected to occur in settings where H2S is very much in excess over Mo or in a restricted setting where the water renewal rate is slow compared to the Mo burial rate. We present a model for the Mo isotope fractionation in sulfidic systems associated with									106	10	0	0	29	0	115			0016-7037	1872-9533		WOS:000273109700011

First-principles calculations was employed to study the effects of Ru content on the electronic structures of the RuxSn1-xO2 coatings. The photoelectric-synergistic catalytic activity of the Ti/RuxSn1-xO2 electrodes was evaluated for the degradation of methyl orange (MO) in aqueous solution. The results show that the RuO2-SnO2 solid solution could be formed. The band gaps of the RuxSn1-xO2 coatings gradually decreased and eventually turned into metallic conductivity with the increase of ruthenium content. As a PEC electrode, reducing band gap is helpful to improve electronic conductivity and the electrocatalytic activity, but not always advantageous to increase the photocatalytic activity. Because too narrow band gap will sacrifice the photogenerated charge carriers and thus reduce photocatalytic activity of the electrode. In our experiments, the rate constant of Ti/Ru0.05Sn0.95O2 electrode increased with increasing Ru content and exhibited the maximum rate for 5% Ru loading. The stability test showed the photoelectrocatalytic activity of the Ti/Ru0.05Sn0.95O2 electrode almost had no attenuation after 100 h photoelectrolysis, revealing that this electrode has good long-term stability.

XRD and Raman revealed anatase and brookite mixed phases. Also, the selected area electron diffraction (SAED) and the fast Fourier transform (FFT), from HRTEM measurements, indicated the presence of the anatase and brookite two phases. XPS showed the incorporation of N and S in both TiO2 matrix and carbon framework structure of RGO. The N,S-TiO2/N,S-RGO photoanodes exhibited an excellent photoelectrochemical (PEC) water oxidation performance. The highest photocurrent density reached 1.1 mA cm(-2) for the N,S-TiO2/N,S-RGO((0.1)) nanocomposite photoanode which is 6 times enhancement greater than bare TiO2 and 5 times enhancement than the N-TiO2/N-RGO((0.1)) (the same GO ratio) at the same potential. These are considered significant promising results in comparison with our previous reported S-TiO2/S-RGO nanocomposite which revealed only 3 times enhancement in photocurrent density than bare TiO2.

Graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) nanosheets have the suitable bandgap and band-edge energies to act as a visible-light photocatalyst for water splitting, but the fast recombination of photoexcited electron-hole pair limits the efficiency. Herein, N-doped few-layer graphene (NFG) dressed with titanium nitride (TiN) nanocrystals (TiN-NFG) is introduced as an efficient co-catalyst which improved the water reduction activity of g-C3N4 by 16 times. The 2D nanocomposite of g-C3N4:TiN-NFG has an extended interface for efficient separation of photoexcited electron-hole pair through electron transfer from g-C3N4 to TiN-NFG. The metal-like electronic structure of TiN in combination with good charge conducting capability of NFG reduces the charge transfer resistance at the electrode/electrolyte interface. Both these aspects are responsible for the enhanced PEC activity leading to a photocurrent density of -196 mu A cm(-2) at 0.11 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode as a photocathode for the g-C3N4:TiN-NFG nanocomposite. The nanocomposite is stable, low cost (free from noble metals), and the extent of enhancement in the PEC efficiency for reduction reaction is remarkable compared to prior literature.									26	0	0	0	5	0	26			2196-7350			WOS:000453864000015

These electrocatalysts consisting of bimetallic Co-Fe alloy nanoparticles encapsulated in N-doped carbon matrix were prepared via pyrolysis of Co/Fe-MOFs after grinding with high amounts of melamine. Chemical/crystal structures suggest high contents of mesoporous carbon in calcinated Co3O4/Fe3O4/mC nanocomposites, which exhibited enhanced electrocatalytic activity toward small biomolecules. The intrinsic performances of Co/Fe-MOFs with large specific surface area and regular nodes in the two-dimensional nanostructured g-C3N4 nanosheets endowed the as-prepared series of Co3O4/Fe3O4/mC@g-C3N4 nanocomposites with remarkable electrocatalytic activities and high adsorption ability toward oxidation of AA, DA, and UA. The developed biosensors also showed long-term stability and high selectivity for targeted analytes, with satisfactory results on actual samples in human urine. The results indicate that the as-synthesized Co3O4/Fe3O4/mC@g-C3N4 nanostructure exhibits good electrocatalytic activity and potential applications in clinical diagnosis and biosensing.

This is particularly true for emerging thin film semiconductors, in which photocarrier diffusion lengths, surface and bulk recombination processes, and charge separation and extraction limitations are poorly understood. Insights into mechanisms of efficiency loss can guide strategies for nanostructuring photoelectrodes, engineering interfaces, and incorporating catalysts. However, few experimental methods are available for direct characterization of dominant loss processes under photoelectrochemical operating conditions. In this work, we provide insight into the function and limitations of an emerging semiconductor photoanode, gamma-Cu3V2O8, by quantifying the spatial collection efficiency (SCE), which is defined as the fraction of photogenerated charge carriers at each point below the surface that contributes to the measured current. Analyzing SCE profiles at different operating potentials shows that increasing the applied potential primarily acts to reduce surface recombination rather than to increase the thickness of the space charge region under the semiconductor/electrolyte interface. Comparing SCE profiles obtained with and without a sacrificial reagent allows surface losses from electronically active defect states to be distinguished from performance bottlenecks arising from slow reaction kinetics. Combining these insights promotes a complete understanding of the photoanode performance and its potential as a water splitting photoanode. More generally, application of the SCE extraction method can aid in the discovery and evaluation of new materials for solar water splitting devices by providing mechanistic details underlying photocurrent generation and loss.									18	0	0	0	2	0	18			1754-5692	1754-5706		WOS:000430537000015

Quantitative analyses of the amide I band (1700-1600 cm(-1)) showed that the OEC16 subunit contains 34% alpha-helix, 28% beta-sheet, 6% turn, and 32% disorder structures at 25 degrees C. This structural feature differs significantly from that of OEC23 as we had reported previously (H. Zhang, Y. Ishikawa, Y. Yamamoto, R. Carpentier, FEES Letters 426 (1998) 347-351), although both the OEC subunits are involved in regulating Ca2+ and Cl- requirements. In addition, it was observed that the structure of OEC16 is stable at < 60 degrees C. At increased temperatures, however, thermal denaturation due to an irreversible protein aggregation occurs with a conformational transition at similar to 65 degrees C. This transitional temperature is considerably higher than that (42.5 degrees C) of the PSII reaction centers as also determined by FTIR spectroscopy (J. De Las Rivas, J. Barber, Biochemistry 36 (1997) 8897-8903). The higher thermostability of OEC16 may indicate the role of OEC16 against heat inactivation of PSII in vivo. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V.

Inspired by semipermeable membranes, a Celgard membrane was used as an interface for separating components of the precursor solution and for ion exchange, to construct hierarchical Co(OH)(2) nanostructures. In contrast to traditional solvothermal reactions, this Celgard membrane-based method is simple and effective for preparing high-loading Co(OH)(2) array (density of approximately 7 mg cm(-2)) on Ni foam. The permeability of the Celgard membrane was affected by the presence of an organic solvent. The morphology of Co(OH)(2) could be adjusted by controlling the OH-diffusion rate across the Celgard membrane. OH-was formed via the hydrolysis of urea solution. The optimized Co(OH) 2 nanosheet electrode exhibited a specific capacitance of 2406 F g(-1) at 1 A g(-1), and good cycling stability (89.1% capacitance retention after 5000 cycles) in 2M aqueous KOH aqueous solution, using a typical three-electrode cell. An asymmetric supercapacitor was assembled with a Co(OH)(2) nanosheet array as the positive electrode, and activated carbon as the negative electrode. The asymmetric supercapacitor exhibited a high energy density (39.2Wh kg(-1)), high power density (9.2 kW kg(-1) at 28.9 Wh kg(-1)), and excellent cycling stability (84.2% capacitance retention after 10,000 cycles).									13	1	0	0	1	0	13			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000437093000022

The phase purity and crystalline size of the synthesized materials were ascertained by using powder X-ray diffraction. The shape and morphology of synthesized materials were characterized by field -emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM) and high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM). The electrocatalytic activity of alpha-Mo2C for 1(-)/I-3(-) redox couple was investigated by the cyclic voltammetry. The synthesized alpha-Mo2C was subsequently applied as counter electrode in dye -sensitized solar cells to replace the expensive platinum.

Herein, we report a facile and simple approach to prepare amorphous, mesoporous C,N co-doped Co-phosphate ultrathin nanosheets via the one-step pyrolysis of a Co-based phosphate precursor with different kinds of coordinated atoms and a 2D layered structure. The resulting material supported on glassy carbon (GC) exhibited an excellent OER activity with a low overpotential of 291 mV, which is 21 mV lower than that of IrO2 catalyst on GC (312 mV) in the same alkaline solution, to afford 10 mA cm(-2). Besides, this electrocatalyst showed fast kinetics with a Tafel slope of 57 mV decade(-1) in a 1.0 M KOH electrolyte, and the polarization curve after continuous 2000 CV cycles showed a negligible difference, indicating its good stability in alkaline media. The highly efficient catalytic performance with long-term stability for OER could be attributed to the following advantages: C,N co-doping facilitates the charge transfer; the amorphous structure and ultrathin 2D nanosheet structure enhance the activity site density; mesoporous structure facilitates the diffusion of O-2. This study provides a new strategy for the design and synthesis of heteroatom-doped high performance electrocatalysts for water oxidation based on MOFs with different types of coordination atoms, such as N and O atoms in the MOFs precursor.									19	1	0	0	1	0	19			2044-4753	2044-4761		WOS:000483698400022

Four kinds of membranes were prepared by 10-40% mass concentrations of FeCl3 center dot 6H(2)O oxidant. Modified membrane with 20% oxidant achieved the best performance with 0.07 e-5A photocurrent intensity. The highest removal ratio of tetracycline hydrochloride (TC, 92%), protein (90%), polysaccharide (57%) and humus (63%) were achieved under -1 V (Vs Ag/AgCl) and 210 W xenon lamp photoelectrocatalytic condition. Under optimized conditions, not only the 90% of TC and 80% of sodium humate were removed, but also the membrane flux maintained well during the 12 h continuous filtration tests. Free radicals of SO4-center dot, O-center dot(2-) and O-1(2) played a key role in the photoelectrocatalytic degradation. The carrier type of the membrane was changed from p-type to n-type after reaction because of the electron injection.									6	0	0	0	3	0	6			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000623286100004

Here we report a cocoon silk chemistry strategy to synthesize isolated metal single-site catalysts embedded in ultrathin 2D porous N-doped carbon nanosheets (M-ISA/CNS, M = Fe, Co, Ni). X-ray absorption fine structure analysis and spherical aberration correction electron microscopy demonstrate an atomic dispersion of metal atoms on N-doped carbon matrix. In particular, the Co-ISA/CNS exhibit ultrahigh specific surface area (2105 m(2) g(-1)) and high activity for C-H bond activation in the direct catalytic oxidation of benzene to phenol with hydrogen peroxide at room temperature, while the Co species in the form of phthalocyanine and metal nanoparticle show a negligible activity. Density functional theory calculations discover that the generated O = Co = O center intermediates on the single Co sites are responsible for the high activity of benzene oxidation to phenol.									130	11	0	0	13	0	132			2041-1723			WOS:000445270100008	30242151

Continuously Changing Quartz-Albite Saturated Melt Compositions to 330 degrees C With Application to Heat Flow and Geochemistry of the Ocean Crust								JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-SOLID EARTH				125	2					e2019JB017654	10.1029/2019JB017654				FEB 2020	2020	Melt compositions in equilibrium with quartz and albite at 0.1 GPa and temperatures from 819 to 330 degrees C are reported for cold seal experiments in the Na2O-Al2O3-SiO2-H2O system. At 60-70 degrees C intervals, melt compositions continuously change from rhyolite-like melts with <10 wt.% H2O at the quartz-albite eutectic to melts of nearly endmember Na2Si2O, having >30 wt.% H2O at 330 degrees C (vapor undersaturated). Melt Na2O increases while SiO2 and Al2O3 decrease down temperature. Experiments performed at T > 600 degrees C are vapor saturated with <9.9-21 wt% H2O while those T < 600 degrees C are vapor undersaturated with 18-37 wt.% H2O. Because of the continuous change in the liquid's composition down temperature, all compositions can he called melts; in reality, their high water contents may also lead to being termed hydrous fluids. These results indicate that igneous processes continue to temperatures >300 degrees C below the haplogranite solidus. The water-rich melts at low temperature have low viscosities and densities suggesting that they buoyantly ascend by reactive flow at low melt porosities (<5%). Formation of low-temperature melt will occur along the sides of gabbro bodies of mid-ocean ridges, resulting in large-scale convection that removes heat from the lower crust. This circulation may move heat off axis influencing observed heat flow. Melt reaction processes result in silicic differentiates (plagiogranites) and formation of greenschist metabasalts. This frees calcium from silicate bonding, providing an important sink for CO2 in Earth's carbon cycle. Sr isotopes of the ocean crust change with ocean crust production rates indicating mid-ocean ridge systems are a major control on Earth's climate over time.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			2169-9313	2169-9356		WOS:000530895200030

Here, using doping andin situlight reduction, a cation vacancy-rich Ag2Ta4O11/Ag-8(Nb0.5Ta0.5)(26)O(69)heterojunction is carefully prepared with Ag nanoparticles as cocatalyst. The prepared material is used to photodegrade gaseous HCHO under completely simulated indoor conditions, presenting 100% conversion for 200 ppm and 85.5% for 1600 ppm HCHO under 7 h of sunlight irradiation. Its long-term effectiveness and speed of use were confirmed with six recycling tests under a long 42 h period of sunlight illumination and activity evaluation over a six-month period. Meanwhile, environmental factor estimation confirms its superior CO(2)selectivity (99.90%) and humidity resistance. These good performances are ascribed to the Ag-0-Ag(+)redox electron pairs producedin situ, Nb doping, various interfacial phase interactions and lots of Ag-deficiencies, which contribute to excellent solar light harvesting, quick separation of electron-hole pairs, strong adsorption towards reactive HCHO, maintenance of strong redox ability, and little shedding or aggregation. Consequently, the present sample could be very promising as a long-lasting material for the removal of indoor HCHO.									3	0	0	0	3	0	3			2051-8153	2051-8161		WOS:000545480500018

However, the practical application of hematite in PEC water splitting is severely hindered by the intrinsically low charge separation efficiency and sluggish water oxidation kinetics. Here, we reported Ti-doped hematite photoanode nanoarrays decorated with cobalt-iron phosphate (CoFePi) ultrathin nanolayers greatly enhanced bulk and surface charge separation efficiency, as well as passivate surface states for promoting the PEC water oxidation activity. The synergistic interactions of CoFePi nanolayers with the Ti-Fe2O3 photoanode yield current densities of 1.75 mA/cm(2) and 2.15 mA/cm(2) in 0.1 M KOH and 1 M KOH respectively at 1.23 V-RHE under AM 1.5 G illumination, which is 2.3 and 3.1 fold higher than bare hematite photoanode, and also even higher than Ti-Fe2O3 and Ti-Fe2O3 coated with cobalt phosphate (CoPi), iron phosphate (FePi), phosphate (Pi), respectively. A low turn-on voltage of 0.68 V-RHE and high incident photon-to-electron conversion efficiency of 46.6% (IPCE, 1.23 V-RHE, lambda = 340 nm) are achieved with the Ti-Fe2O3/CoFePi photoanode. Collectively, the results demonstrated that the synergistic Ti-Fe2O3/CoFePi photoanode is promising for PEC water oxidation for hydrogen production.									48	6	0	0	6	0	48			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000445416900005

After withdrawal at a constant rate, the films were dried at temperatures between 100 and 400 degreesC for various periods of time (15 min to 1 hour). Electron diffraction and transmission electron microscopy studies have indicated that the as-formed SG films are nanocrystalline oxide materials, consisting of cubic units of NiO and/or CoO (and Co3O4, in pure Co SG films) in crystallites which are 1-4 nm in diameter, the size depending on the oxide composition and the drying conditions employed. Oxide films formed at 200 degreesC are highly hydrous in nature, and drying at higher temperatures than this results in the loss of water, the formation of more compact films and an increase in the crystallite size. Based on the observed charge efficiencies (ca. 75% for pure Ni oxide and ca. 60% for 50:50 Ni:Co oxide films), it is suggested that only metal sites on the outer surfaces of the crystallites, with easy access to the solution ions and water, participate in the Ni-Co oxide redox reaction in alkaline solutions.

A visible active B-rGO/ZnFe2O4 photocatalyst was synthesized through the hydrothermal process, further magnify its electronic properties, the binary hybrid is modified with polypyrrole. The designed ternary hybrid utilizes the combining benefits of photo-sensitizer and interfacial charge transfer mechanism that ultimately boost its photocatalytic efficiency. The estab-lishment of interfacial p-n heterojunction via band-bending mechanism between B-rGO (BG) nanosheets and ZnFe2O4 (ZnF) nanoparticles was validated from photo-density in the opposite direction and upturned V-shaped Mott-Schottky plots. It was observed that 2BG/ ZnF@20PPY exhibits the best activity i.e., 100% reduction of 50 ppm Cr (VI) in 45 min and H2-production of 598 mmolh-1. Effective charge separation in 2BG/ZnF@20PPY is well sup -ported by PL, TRPL, EIS, transient-photocurrent, and donor density calculations. The strong contact among the constituents in 2BG/ZnF@20PPY is well-correlated with XPS and Raman characterization. (c) 2021 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

The Mars Test Particle simulation calculates the detailed ion velocity space distribution through a background magnetic and electric field model at specific locations. The main objective of this work is to extensively probe the sources of O+ ion escape relative to the production mechanisms: photoionization, charge exchange, and electron impact. Seven production methods are explored and compared, resulting in total production and loss rates differing up to two orders of magnitude. Photoionization was compared as a function of solar zenith angle and optical shadow. Charge exchange O+ production was studied with three methods: a constant rate assuming cold ion collisions, a constant rate proportional to the reaction cross-section and upstream solar wind bulk velocity, and finally a novel approach proportional to the cross-section and both the random and bulk velocity. Finally, electron impact ionization was considered as a constant and as a function of electron temperature. Of these methods, a baseline of the most physically relevant ion mechanisms was selected. Additionally, energy distributions at specific spatial locations highlight the individual ion populations in velocity space, revealing asymmetric and nongyrotropic features due to specific ionization methods. Analysis of the O+ flux and loss is in agreement with observations and also indicates a strong polar plume in the northern hemisphere for a given interplanetary magnetic field orientation. We calculate the total production and escape to be 2.5 x 10(25) and 6.4 x 10(24), respectively. Citation: Curry, S. M., M. Liemohn, X. Fang, Y. Ma, and J.

Here, it is reported that room-temperature anodization of a Co(TCNQ)(2) (TCNQ = tetracyanoquinodimethane) nanowire array on copper foam at alkaline pH leads to in situ electrochemcial oxidation of TCNQ(-) into water-insoluable TCNQ nanoarray embedding Co(OH)(2) nanoparticles. Such Co(OH)(2)-TCNQ/CF shows superior catalytic activity for water oxidation and demands only a low overpotential of 276 mV to drive a geometrical current density of 25 mA cm(-2) in 1.0 m KOH. Notably, it also demonstrates strong long-term electrochemical durability with its activity being retrained for at least 25 h, a high turnover frequency of 0.97 s(-1) at an overpotential of 450 mV and 100% Faradic efficiency. This study provides an exciting new method for the rational design and development of a conductive TCNQ-based nanoarray as an interesting 3D material for advanced electrochemical applications.									276	15	0	0	23	0	276			0935-9648	1521-4095		WOS:000426491600018	29333685

The annealing of macroporous structures in an atmosphere of Ar, instead of H-2, simplifies the requirements to equipment and safety engineering. The sintering of macroporous silicon as result of annealing at T = 1000-1280A degrees C in a horizontal tube purged with high-purity gases: Ar or Ar + 3%H-2 is examined. Experiments were conducted with layers having deep cylindrical macropores produced by the electrochemical etching of samples with seed pits on their surface (ordered pores) and without seeds (random pores). The morphology of the porous structure and the changes in this structure upon annealing are studied with electron and optical microscopes. It is shown that, depending on the pore diameter and treatment temperature, the following transformation occurs: the pore surface is smoothed, pores are closed and a surface crust is formed, cylindrical pores are spheroidized and decompose into isolated hollow spheres, and a fine structure and faceting are formed. It is shown that the (111) planes have the minimal surface energy. It is found that the annealing of macroporous silicon in an inert gas leads to strong thermal etching, which is manifested in the fact that the porosity increases or even the porous layer at the sample edge fully disappears. Moreover, an oxide layer appears as a film, beads, or long filaments forming a glass wool upon annealing, especially at low temperatures. These features can be attributed to the presence of trace amounts of an oxidizing agent in the inert gas, which causes the formation of highly volatile SiO and products formed in the reaction involving this compound.									5	1	0	0	0	0	6			1063-7826	1090-6479		WOS:000409137200009

It is continuously being damaged, degraded and resynthesized. Under high light, photosystem II inactivation is observed. This is because the rate of D1 damage is faster than that of its replacement. This process can be reversed if exposure to high light is not too long. In this work we study the changes that occur in the transcriptional and translational machinery that could lead to irreversible photoinhibition in Synechocystis PCC 6714. In the first minutes of photoinhibition, high light induced an accumulation of psbA mRNA due to an increase in psbA transcription initiation. Although the transcription rate of other photosynthetic genes (e.g. psaE and cpcB-cpcA) declined, the high turnover of the psbA transcript was maintained for a long time. When the light stress was too long, the stability of psbA mRNA increased and the psbA transcription rate appeared to decrease. A high level of psbA mRNA was maintained even though translation no longer occurred and the cells were unable to recover. Experiments to measure newly synthesized D1 incorporation into the thylakoid membranes during recovery in the presence of rifampicin showed that the initiation of transcription was not required for translation of psbA mRNA when photoinhibition was still reversible. Since psbA translation did not depend on the level of psbA transcript or on the initiation of psbA transcription, we propose that damage to the translational machinery also occurred during light stress, leading to the inhibition of D1 synthesis and to irreversible photoinhibition.									34	3	0	0	31	0	37			0167-4412			WOS:A1997XB24800001	9177308

The 2D crystals were either large cylindrical vesicles (1 to 2 mu m by 4 to 6 mu m as flattened vesicles) or large monolayer sheets (ca. 1 mu m x 1 mu m), both suitable for cryo-electron microscopy Images of unstained crystals embedded in ice were recorded using low-dose microscopy and analyzed by digital image processing. Both types of crystals had the same unit cell size and the same packing arrangement of PSII particles. The plane group was rho 22(1)2(1) and the unit cell was rectangular with dimensions of 16.7 nm x 15.3 nm containing four monomers (two face-up and two face-down). SDS-PAGE and immunoblot analyses of the 2D crystal indicated that the constituent subunits of particles in the 2D crystal were CP47, D1, D2, cytochrome b-559 and psbI protein. A projection map at 20 Angstrom resolution revealed that each monomer has an asymmetrical shape with a length of 8.1 nm and a maximal width of 7.5 nm consisting of four areas of density. Two high-density areas with similar sizes were located close to each other to form a roughly rectangular core of 4.0 nm x 6.5 nm. From its size similarity to the size of the L/M heterodimer of the bacterial reaction center, this high density core area was tentatively assigned to the D1/D2 heterodimer. The remaining large and small areas were also tentatively assigned to CP47 and cytochrome b-559 plus psbI protein, respectively.

Both compounds caused a significant inhibition of the radicle growth of Amaranthus hypochondriacus and Echinochloa crus-galli, exerted moderate cytotoxic activity against three different solid tumour cell lines and inhibited significantly the radial growth of three phytopathogenic fungi. Isoalloalantolactone also caused the inhibition of ATP synthesis, proton uptake and electron transport (basal, phosphorylating and uncoupled) from water to methylviologen, therefore acting as a Hill's reaction inhibitor. The lactone did not affect photosystem I but inhibited photosystem II. The site of inhibition of isoalloalantolactone is located in the span of P-680 to Q(A) redox enzymes because the uncoupled electron transport from water to silicomolybdate and, from DPC to DCIP are inhibited approximately to the same extent.									32	1	0	0	22	0	34			0031-9422			WOS:A1995RV97300011	7546556

Assuming that reducing the 3CD expression can alleviate the competition with P1 expression and elevate the VLPs yield, hereby we constructed Bac-P1-C3CD and Bac-P1-I3CD expressing 3CD under weaker CMV and IE-1 promoters, respectively. Western blot and ELISA analyses revealed that Bac-P1-C3CD and Bac-P1-I3CD led to the VLPs release into the supernatant and enhanced the extracellular VLPs yield in Sf-9 cells, but gave poor VLPs production in High Five (TM) (Hi-5) cells. By optimizing the process parameters including host cells, cell density, culture mode and dissolved oxygen (DO), the best extracellular VLPs yield was achieved by infecting Sf-9 cells (4 x 10(6) cells/mL) cultured in the bioreactor (DO = 30%) with Bac-P1-C3CD, which approached approximate to 64.3 mg/L and represented a approximate to 43-fold increase over the yield (1.5 mg/L) attained using the old process (Bac-P1-3CD infection of Sf-9 cells in the spinner flasks). The resultant VLPs not only resembled the VLPs produced from Bac-P1-3CD infection in density, size and shape, but also induced potent antibody responses in mouse models. The antibodies neutralized EV71 strains of homologous and heterologous genogroups, implicating the potential of the VLPs to confer cross-protection for the prevention of future epidemics. Altogether, Bac-P1-C3CD and the bioprocess render mass production more economical, obviate the need for cell lysis and hold promise for future industrial vaccine production. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Warren, PH								Magnesium oxide iron oxide mass balance constraints and a more detailed model for the relationship between eucrites and diogenites								METEORITICS & PLANETARY SCIENCE				32	6			945	963		10.1111/j.1945-5100.1997.tb01583.x				NOV 1997	1997	According to a currently popular model for petrogenesis on the howardite, eucrite, and diogenite (HED) parent asteroid, the diogenites are not comagmatic with most eucrites but instead formed in separate orthopyroxenite-dominated plutons. This model can be tested for consistency with mass balance for MgO and FeO, assuming the overall diogenite/(diogenite + eucrite) ratio, d, of the parent asteroid is at least comparable to the average d for the eucrite + diogenite dominated howardite regolith breccias. Average mg# (=MgO/[MgO + FeO]) is much lower for eucrites, especially noncumulate eucrites, than for diogenites. Unless the diogenite parent magmas eventually produced a large proportion of low-mg# residual basalt and gabbro (RBG), the implied initial magma's mg# is vastly higher than that of any noncumulate eucrite. Starting from a source previously depleted by putative primary eucrite genesis, melt mg# can be estimated as a function of the exchange reaction K-D and degree of melting. Using several very conservative assumptions (e.g., assuming that the total [MgO + FeO] concentration is nearly the same in the nascent melt as in the residual solids), the degree of melting required to yield a melt with mg# high enough to satisfy mass balance, without implying an RBG component that accounts for >50% of all eucrites, is an implausibly high 60-80 wt%.The separate orthopyroxenitic plutons (SOP) model also seems inconsistent with the uniform density of melts across the diogenite-eucrite compositional spectrum (2.77-2.82 g/cm(3)), which implies that diogenitic magmas should have been as capable as eucrites of extruding to form lavas. This difficulty cannot be reduced by simply assuming that later-formed magmas were systematically both more plutonic and more MgO-rich than earlier ones, because the plutonic cumulate eucrites equilibrated with melts systematically lower in mg# than noncumulate eucrites. Conceivably, the bulk mg# of the asteroid's silicate system was increased between primary-melt eucrite genesis and SOP diogenite genesis by graphite-fueled reduction of FeO. However, the graphite oxidation process generates a huge proportion of gas, which would have enhanced the buoyancy of the nascent diogenite-parent magmas, thus exacerbating the difficulty of achieving the implied high degrees of partial melting.To avoid these difficulties but still form most eucrites as rapidly cooled extrusives, I propose the NERD (noncumulate eucrites as extruded residua of diogenites) model. In this model, the diogenites form as early cumulates from a large magma system (probably a global ''magma ocean'') that yields a large proportion of eucritic melt as residuum, This residual melt zone undergoes relatively little crystallization during a period when it is episodically tapped to produce extrusions, dikes and sills of rapidly cooled noncumulate eucrites. Slight (similar to 5-10%) porosity in the nascent eucritic crust keeps it marginally buoyant over the residual melt zone. The common thermal metamorphism of noncumulate eucrites results from baking by superjacent flows during the episodic venting of the melt zone. The NERD model's greatest advantage is that it does not require implausibly high degrees of localized melting in the mature stages of igneous evolution of the HED asteroid.									68	1	0	0	1	0	69			1086-9379			WOS:A1997YG98100023

We constructed self-consistent nonequilibrium ionization SNR models assuming a Sedov solution for the dynamical evolution, and then applied the resulting spectral models to the data obtained by the Solid State Imaging Spectrometer on board the Advanced Satellite for Cosmology and Astrophysics. All the remnants were reasonably well described by the model, which allowed us to derive accurate values for their physical parameters, i.e., ages, densities, initial explosion energies, and metal abundances. The derived explosion energies vary from 5 x 10(50) to 6 x 10(51) ergs. A restricted subset of the sample exists for which the ionization and Sedov dynamical ages agree quite well under the assumption that the electron and ion temperatures are not fully equilibrated at the shock front; for these four SNRs, the mean value of the initial explosion energy is (1.1 +/- 0.5) x 10(51) ergs. We show that it is likely that the other three remnants, all of which have inferred explosion energies greater than or similar to 3 x 10(51) ergs, exploded within preexisting cavities in the interstellar medium. The limits on high-energy X-ray emission(greater than or similar to 3 keV) that we present indicate that these SNRs do not contain very luminous pulsar-powered synchrotron nebulae, in general agreement with our picture of them as evolved, middle-aged remnants. We find statistical evidence for enrichment by supernova ejecta in the sense that smaller remnants show a somewhat higher mean metallicity than the larger ones. In the case of DEM 71, the putative remnant of a Type Ia supernova, the derived abundance of iron is about a factor of 2 larger than the other remnants in the sample. These things being said, however, the derived abundances are in general dominated by swept-up interstellar material, and so we use the SNR sample to estimate the mean LMC gas-phase abundances. We find that the astrophysically common elements from oxygen to iron are less abundant: than the solar values by factors of 2-4. Overall, these results are consistent with previous ones based on optical and UV data but do not show the anomalous overabundance of magnesium and silicon seen by others.									161	1	0	0	0	0	162			0004-637X	1538-4357		WOS:000077778500020		
J	Wang, Wenzhong; Zhang, Weiwei; Meng, Shan; Jia, Lujie; Tan, Miao; Hao, Chenchun; Liang, Yujie; Wang, Jun; Zou, Bin								Enhanced Photoelectrochemical Water Splitting and Photocatalytic Water Oxidation of Cu2O Nanocube-Loaded BiVO4 Nanocrystal Heterostructures								ELECTRONIC MATERIALS LETTERS				12	6			753	760		10.1007/s13391-016-6224-9				NOV 2016	2016	Reducing the fast recombination of photogenerated electron-hole pairs of semiconductor photocatalyst is very important to improve its photocatalysis. In this paper we fabricate Cu2O nanocube-decorated BiVO4 nanocrystal (denoted as BiVO4@Cu2O nanocrystal@nanocube) heterostructure photocatalyst by coupling n-type BiVO4 with p-type Cu2O. The BiVO4@ Cu2O nanocrystal@nanocube photocatalysts show superior photocatalytic activities in photoelectrochemical (PEC) activity and photocatalytic water oxidation to BiVO4 photocatalysts under visible light illumination. The BiVO4@Cu2O nanocrystal@ nanocube heterostructure electrode achieves the highest photocurrent density of similar to 10 mu A cm(-2) at 0 V versus Ag/AgCl, 5 times higher than that of BiVO4 nanocrystal electrode (similar to 2 mu A cm(-2)). The light induced evolution rate of O-2 generation for BiVO4@Cu2O nanocrystal@ nanocube heterostructures is as high as 150 mu mol h(-1) 100 mg cat(-1), more than 3 times higher than that (48 mu mol h(-1) 100 mg cat(-1)) of BiVO4 nanocrystals. The enhanced photocatalysis activities of the BiVO4@Cu2O nanocrystal@ nanocube photocatalysts are attributed to the efficient separation of the photoexcited electron-hole pairs caused by inner electronic field (IEF) of p-n junction. This study opens up new opportunities in designing photoactive materials with highly enhanced performance for solar energy conversion.									15	1	0	0	1	0	15			1738-8090	2093-6788		WOS:000387440400006

The corresponding protein (TrxB2) showed a high similarity with Bacillus subtilis YumC (E value = 4.0E-88), and YumC was able to fully complement the Delta trxB2 mutant phenotype. YumC represents a novel type of ferredoxin (flavodoxin) reductase (FdR) with hitherto-unknown biological function. We adaptively evolved the Delta trxB2 mutant under aerobic conditions to find suppressor mutations that could help elucidate the involvement of TrxB2 in aerobic growth. Genome sequencing of two independent isolates, which were able to grow as well as the wild-type strain under aerated conditions, revealed the importance of mutations in nrdI, encoding a flavodoxin involved in aerobic ribonucleotide reduction. We suggest a role for TrxB2 in nucleotide metabolism, where the flavodoxin (NrdI) serves as its redox partner, and we support this hypothesis by showing the beneficial effect of deoxynucleosides on aerobic growth of the Delta trxB2 mutant. Finally, we demonstrate, by heterologous expression, that the TrxB2 protein functionally can substitute for YumC in B. subtilis but that the addition of deoxynucleosides cannot compensate for the lethal phenotype displayed by the B. subtilis yumC knockout mutant.IMPORTANCE Ferredoxin (flavodoxin) reductase (FdR) is involved in many important reactions in both eukaryotes and prokaryotes, such as photosynthesis, nitrate reduction, etc. The recently identified bacterial YumC-type FdR belongs to a novel type, the biological function of which still remains elusive. We found that the YumC-like FdR (TrxB2) is essential for aerobic growth of Lactococcus lactis. We suggest that the YumC-type FdR is involved in the ribonucleotide reduction by the class Ib ribonucleotide reductase, which represents the workhorse for the bioconversion of nucleotides to deoxynucleotides in many prokaryotes and eukaryotic pathogens under aerobic conditions. As the partner of the flavodoxin (NrdI), the key FdR is missing in the current model describing the class Ib system in Escherichia coli. With this study, we have established a role for this novel type of FdR and in addition found the missing link needed to explain how ribonucleotide reduction is carried out under aerobic conditions.									15	0	0	0	9	0	15			2150-7511			WOS:000367524700002	26507228

J	Hendry, G; Wydrzynski, T								The two substrate-water molecules are already bound to the oxygen-evolving complex in the S-2 state of photosystem II								BIOCHEMISTRY				41	44			13328	13334		10.1021/bi026246t				NOV 5 2002	2002	The first direct evidence which shows that both substrate-water molecules are bound to the O-2-evolving catalytic site in the S-2 state of photosystem II (PSII) is presented. Rapid O-18 isotope exchange measurements between (H2O)-O-18 incubated in the S-2 state of PSII-enriched membrane samples and the photogenerated O-2 reveal a fast and a slow phase of exchange at mle 34 (which measures the level of the (OO)-O-16-O-18 product). The rate constant for the slow phase of exchange ((34)k(1)) equals 1.9 +/- 0.3 s(-1) at 10degreesC, while the fast phase of exchange is unresolved by our current experimental setup ((34)k(2) greater than or equal to 175 s-1). The unresolvable fast phase has left open the possibility that the second substrate-water molecule binds to the catalytic site only after the formation of the S-3 state [Hillier, W., and Wydrzynski, T. (2000) Biochemistry, 39, 4399-4405]. However, for PSII samples depleted of the 17 and 23 kDa extrinsic proteins (Ex-depleted PSII), two completely resolvable phases of O-18 exchange are observed in the S-2 state of the residual activity, with the following rate constants: (34)k(1) = 2.6 +/-0.3.s(-1) and (34)k(2) = 120 +/- 14 s(-1) at 10degreesC. Upon addition of 15 mM CaCl2 to Ex-depleted PSII, the O-2 evolution activity increases to similar to80% of the control level, while the two resolvable phases of exchange remain the same. In measurements of Ex-depleted PSII at mle 36 (which measures the level of the (OO)-O-18-O-18 product), only a single phase of exchange is observed in the S-2 state, with a rate constant ((36)k(1) = 2.5 +/- 0.2 s(-1)) that is identical to the slow rate of exchange in the We 34 data. Taken together, these results show that the fast phase of O-18 exchange is specifically slowed by the removal of the 17 and 23 kDa extrinsic proteins and that the two substrate-water molecules must be bound to independent sites already in the S-2 state. In contrast, the O-18 exchange behavior in the S-1 state of Ex-depleted PSII is no different from what is observed for the control, with or without the addition of CaCl2. Since the fast phase of exchange in the S-1 state is unresolved (i.e., (34)k(2) > 100 s(-1)), the possibility remains that the second substrate-water molecule binds to the catalytic site only after the formation of the S-2 state. The role of the 17 and 23 kDa extrinsic proteins in establishing an asymmetric dielectric environment around the substrate binding sites is discussed.									73	3	0	0	35	0	74			0006-2960			WOS:000178916000024	12403635	
J	Luc, Wesley; Jiao, Feng								Synthesis of Nanoporous Metals, Oxides, Carbides, and Sulfides: Beyond Nanocasting								ACCOUNTS OF CHEMICAL RESEARCH				49	7			1351	1358		10.1021/acs.accounts.6b00109				JUL 2016	2016	CONSPECTUS: Nanoporous metal-based solids are of particular interest because they combine a large quantity of surface metal sites, interconnected porous networks, and nanosized crystalline walls, thus exhibiting unique physical and chemical properties compared to other nanostructures and bulk counterparts. Among all of the synthetic approaches, nanocasting has proven to be a highly effective method for the syntheses of metal oxides with three-dimensionally ordered porous structures and crystalline walls. A typical procedure involves a thermal annealing process of a porous silica template filled with an inorganic precursor (often a metal nitrate salt), which converts the precursor into a desired phase within the silica pores. The final step is the selective removal of the silica template in either a strong base or a hydrofluoric acid solution. In the past decade, nanocasting has become a popular synthetic approach and has enabled the syntheses of a variety of nanoporous metal oxides. However, there is still a lack of synthetic methods to fabricate nanoporous materials beyond simple metal oxides. Therefore, the development of new synthetic strategies beyond nanocasting has become an important direction. This Account describes new progress in the preparation of novel nanoporous metal-based solids for heterogeneous catalysis. The discussion begins with a method called dealloying, an effective method to synthesize nanoporous metals. The starting material is a metallic alloy containing two or more elements followed by a selective chemical or electrochemical leaching process that removes one of the preferential elements, resulting in a highly porous structure. Nanoporous metals, such as Cu, Ag, and CuTi, exhibit remarkable electrocatalytic properties in carbon dioxide reduction, oxygen reduction, and hydrogen evolution reactions. In addition, the syntheses of metal oxides with hierarchical porous structures are also discussed. On the basis of the choice of hard template, nanoporous metal oxides with bimodal pore size distributions can be obtained. Combining nanocasting with chemical etching, a cobalt oxide with a hierarchical porous structure was synthesized, which possessed a surface area up to 250 m(2) g(-1), representing the highest surface area reported to date for nanoporous cobalt oxides. Lastly, this Account also covers the syntheses of nanoporous metal carbides and sulfides. The combination of in situ carburization and nanocasting enabled the syntheses of two ordered nanoporous metal carbides, Mo2C and W2C. For nanoporous metal sulfides, an "oxide-to-sulfide" synthetic strategy was proposed to address the large volume change issue of converting metal nitrate precursors to metal sulfide products in nanocasting. The successful syntheses of ordered nanoporous FeS2, CoS2, and NiS2 demonstrated the feasibility of the "oxide-to-sulfide" method. Concluding remarks include a summary of recent advances in the syntheses of nanoporous metal based solids and a brief discussion of future opportunities in the hope of stimulating new interests and ideas.									55	3	0	0	6	0	56			0001-4842	1520-4898		WOS:000380296400003	27294847	
J	Qian, M; AlKhaldi, SF; PutnamEvans, C; Bricker, TM; Burnap, RL								Photoassembly of the photosystem II (Mn)4 cluster in site-directed mutants impaired in the binding of the manganese-stabilizing protein								BIOCHEMISTRY				36	49			15244	15252		10.1021/bi9713198				DEC 9 1997	1997	Photoactivation is the light-dependent ligation of Mn2+ into the H2O oxidation complex of photosystem II (PSII) and culminates in the formation of an enzymatically active complex containing Ca2+ and four Mngreater than or equal to 3+. Previous kinetic analysis demonstrated that the genetic removal of the extrinsic manganese-stabilizing protein (MSP) increases the quantum yield of photoactivation if-fold relative to that of the wild type, consistent with the hypothesis that MSP hinders access of Mn2+ to a site of photoligation [Burnap, R, L,, et al, (1996) Biochemistry 35, 874-882]. in this report, several Synechocystis sp, PCC6803 mutants with defined amino acid substitutions in the N-terminal region of MSP or the e-loop of intrinsic PSII protein CP47 [Putnam-Evans, C,, et al. (1996) Biochemistry 35, 4046-4053] were characterized in terms of the binding of MSP to the intrinsic portion of the PSII complex and in terms of photoactivation kinetics, The charge-pair switch mutation, Arg384Arg385 --> Glu384Glu385 in the lumenal e-loop of CP47 (CP47 RR384385EE), exhibited the most severe impairment of MSP binding, whereas the Arg384Arg385 --> Gly384Gly385 (CF47 RR384385GG) mutation caused a more moderate impairment in binding, Single-substitution mutations at the highly conserved Asp9 or Asp10 positions in the aminoterminal region of MSP also resulted in a reduced binding affinity, but not as severe as that in CP47 RR384385EE. The relative quantum yield elf photoactivation of hydroxylamine-extracted mutant PSII was generally found to correlate with the degree of MSP binding impairment, with the CP47 RR384385 mutants exhibiting the highest quantum yields. A two-locus, double-mutant construct involving deletion of MSP in the CS47 RR384385EE background was found to be only slightly more impaired in H2O oxidation activity than either of the corresponding single-locus mutant derivatives, indicating that mutations at these genetically separate loci encode physically interacting products affecting the same reaction parameter during H2O oxidation. Taken together, the results reinforce the concept that MSP interacts with the e-loop of CP47 at Arg384Arg385 and that disruption of this interaction causes significant alterations of the site of H2O oxidation in terms of assembly and enzymatic activity of the Mn cluster.									40	1	0	0	35	0	40			0006-2960			WOS:A1997YL10500024	9398252	
J	Du, Zhi; Li, Meng; Ren, Jinsong; Qu, Xiaogang								Current Strategies for Modulating A beta Aggregation with Multifunctional Agents								ACCOUNTS OF CHEMICAL RESEARCH				54	9			2172	2184		10.1021/acs.accounts.1c00055		APR 2021		MAY 4 2021	2021	CONSPECTUS: Alzheimer's disease (AD), as the primary cause of dementia, has seriously affected millions of people worldwide and brought a very heavy financial and social burden. With the growth of population and aging, the situation will worsen unless efficacious drugs are found to reverse, stop, or even slow down disease progression. More and more evidence has demonstrated that amyloid-beta (A beta) aggregation is an upstream causative factor in AD pathogenesis and then triggers a slew of pathological events. Furthermore, the concentrated redox metal ions in the AD brain, especially Cu(II), can significantly exacerbate A beta aggregation and contribute to the formation of neurotoxic reactive oxygen species (ROS). Therefore, the inhibition of A beta aggregation and relief of amyloidosis-initiated neurotoxicity play a critical role in AD treatment. Until now, several methods have been proposed to modulate A beta aggregation, such as developing aggregation inhibitors to interfere with A beta assembly via noncovalent interactions, copper chelators to cut off metal-accelerated A beta aggregation and concomitant cytotoxicity, photooxidation to reduce the hydrophobicity and aggregation tendency of A beta, thermal dissociation to disrupt amyloid aggregates susceptible to temperature, degradation with artificial protease to fracture the A beta peptide into small fragments, and the clearance of peripheral A beta to bypass the obstruction of the BBB and reduce the A beta burden. In this Account, we focus on our contributions to the development of A beta-targeted multifunctional molecules and nanoparticles, emphasizing the diversified strategies and synergistic therapeutic effects. These therapeutic agents possess the following multifunctionalities: (1) compared with frequently used aggregation inhibitors restricted by intrinsically feeble and sensitive noncovalent interactions, multifunctional agents can efficiently block A beta aggregation by exploiting two or more A beta-specific inhibition strategies simultaneously; (2) apart from regulating A beta aggregation, multipronged agents can also target and modulate other pathological factors in AD pathogenesis, such as increased oxidative stress, abnormal copper accumulation, and irreversible neuron loss; (3) multifunctional platforms with both diagnostic and therapeutic modalities through integrating in situ imaging, realtime diagnostics, a multitarget direction, stimuli-responsive drug release, and the blood-brain barrier (BBB) translocation features are instrumental in improving drug levels at trouble sites, diminishing off-target adverse reactions, evaluating therapeutic effects, and averting overtreatment.Given the fact that amyloid aggregation, local inflammation, and metal dyshomeostasis are universal biomarkers shared by various neurodegenerative disorders, this Account provides a perspective for the evolution of customized therapeutic agents with multiple reactivities for other neurodegenerative diseases. In addition, recent studies have indicated that A beta aggregates can enter the nucleus and induce DNA damage and anomalous conformational transition. We also explore the influences of DNA on the biological effects of A beta aggregates.									40	3	0	0	11	0	40			0001-4842	1520-4898		WOS:000648508400012	33881820

The plasma deposition and the film properties were characterized with respect to the deposition rate evaluated from scanning electron microscopy observations, the film refractive index determined by spectroscopic ellipsometry and the film density measured by X-ray reflectometry. The layer chemical structure was investigated by Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy analysis, Si-29 solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance technique, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy measurements. The film growth rate exhibits a typical evolution as a function of the process parameters and appears to be dependent on the nature of the substrate, We are able to correlate the structure of the films obtained with the important composite parameter V/P-p (RF voltage V over the monomer partial pressure P-p) characterizing the input energy per unit mass of monomer, Chemical analysis spectra show that the concentration of [(CH3)(2)-Si(-O)(2)] silicon environment increases with lowering the V/P-p ratio; at very low V/P-p values, plasma polymers are close to polydimethylsiloxane. By contrast, the thin layers contain a high [SiO4] concentration, characteristic of SiO2, when MP, increases. Moreover, increasing VIP, results in higher C/Si and O/Si ratios while the film's density and refractive index also rise.

The O 1s and N 1s intensities and binding energies were used to fingerprint the types of adsorbed species and to monitor the changes in their coverage and adsorption sites. From the O 1s intensity during uptake on Rh(533) it was determined that the NO initial sticking coefficient is temperature independent between 330 and 490 K. The N 1s spectra revealed the consecutive appearance of two atomic nitrogen species. By comparing the N 1s spectra on Rh(533) with those measured on Rh(111) and Rh(311) these species were attributed to adsorption on terrace sites, N-T, and step sites, N-S. N-T is the only species formed in the initial stage of adsorption, whereas the N-S species appears later on. This finding indicates that the NO dissociation occurs on terrace adsorption sites in the low coverage regime (total coverage less than or equal to 0.25 monolayers). The stepped surfaces conserve a high reactivity at higher coverages because the NO dissociation continues on the steps after the terraces have been filled. The abrupt changes in the NO dissociation probability with increasing adsorbate coverage are discussed in terms of destabilization of the N-T species by repulsive interactions and of subsequent compression of the adsorbed O and NO.

We weigh the advantages and disadvantages of a tandem converter against other approaches, including biomass. Owing to the low density of solar energy per unit area, artificial photosynthetic systems must operate at high efficiency to minimize the land (or sea) area required. In particular, tandem converters are a much better option than biomass for densely populated countries and use two photons per electron extracted from water as the raw material into chemical conversion to hydrogen, or carbon-based fuel when CO2 is also used. For the average total light sum of 40 mol m(-2) d(-1) for The Netherlands, the upper limits are many tons of hydrogen or carbon-based fuel per hectare per year. A principal challenge is to forge materials for quantitative conversion of photons to chemical products within the physical limitation of an internal potential of ca 2.9 V. When going from electric charge in the tandem to hydrogen and back to electricity, only the energy equivalent to 1.23 V can be stored in the fuel and regained. A critical step is then to learn from nature how to use the remaining difference of ca 1.7 V effectively by triple use of one overpotential for preventing recombination, kinetic stabilization of catalytic intermediates and finally generating targeted heat for the release of oxygen. Probably the only way to achieve this is by using bioinspired responsive matrices that have quantum-classical pathways for a coherent conversion of photons to fuels, similar to what has been achieved by natural selection in evolution. In appendix A for the expert, we derive a propagator that describes how catalytic reactions can proceed coherently by a convergence of time scales of quantum electron dynamics and classical nuclear dynamics. We propose that synergy gains by such processes form a basis for further progress towards high efficiency and yield for a global project on artificial photosynthesis. Finally, we look at artificial photosynthesis research in The Netherlands and use this as an example of how an interdisciplinary approach is beneficial to artificial photosynthesis research. We conclude with some of the potential societal consequences of a large-scale roll out of artificial photosynthesis.									23	0	0	0	7	1	23			2042-8898	2042-8901		WOS:000357874700010	26052428

Evidence of increased oxidative DNA damage to the aorta of hypothyroid rats								IN VIVO				22	5			603	608						SEP-OCT 2008	2008	Background: Although it has been suggested that the hypometabolic state is associated with a decrease in oxidative stress, literature data are controversial, revealing an individuality if oxidant status in relation to tissue properties and responsiveness. Hypothyroidism has profound direct and indirect actions on the vascular system, inducing characteristic hemodynamic changes while the aorta represents an important determinant of vascular performance. This study aims to examine the oxidant status on the aorta in chronic experimental hypothyroidism. Materials and Methods: Chronic experimental hypothyroidism was successfully induced in 20 male Wistar rats by administration of 0.05% 6-n-propyl 2-thiouracil in their drinking water for 8 weeks. Age-matched euthyroid rats were, used as controls. Lipid peroxidation in the serum was determined by the end-product malondialdehyde (MDA). Oxidative damage to genomic DNA of aortic tissue and serum was investigated by measuring 8-oxo-dG, one of the base modifications produced in DNA by the reaction of reactive oxygen species. Serum lipids measurement was performed. Results: A hypothyroid state was confirmed by levels of serum thyroid hormones, lipidemic profile, clinical examination, pathological findings and cardiovascular hemodynamics parameters. Hypothyroidism was associated with a significant increase in lipid peroxidation. (MDA 1.44 +/- 0.93 vs. 0.64 +/- 0.53 nmol/ml, p<0.01). Levels of 8-oxo-dG on the aortic ring, expressing the oxidant damage on genomic DNA and in the serum, were observed to be significantly raised in the hypothyroid group compared to controls (8-oxodG(serum) 29.22 +/- 17.78 vs. 17.56 +/- 4.44 ng/ml, p<0.01; 8-oxo-dG(aorta) 11.58 +/- 2.70 vs. 4.09 +/- 1.27 ng/ml, p<0.001). A statistical correlation between measurements of 8-oxo-dG in the aorta and serum was found (correlation coefficient=0.36, p<0.05). A hyperlipidemic profile in hypothyroid animals was revealed. Conclusion: Vascular oxidative stress seems to play a pivotal role in the evolution of vascular pathology. Hypothyroidism was associated with increased DNA oxidative damage to the aorta. Hypercholesterolemia and an increase in mean arterial pressure associated with hypothyroidism may have a contributive role in the accumulation of damage in nuclear DNA of the vascular wall. 8-Oxo-dG is one of the mutagenic base modifications produced in DNA. Although clinical studies in other tissues have indicated a direct correlation between in vivo 8-oxo-dG formation and pathological processes, its role on the vascular wall needs further investigation.									12	0	1	0	8	0	13			0258-851X			WOS:000259572900011	18853754

In the present study, a novel microsomal GST homology was identified from Apostichopus japonicus (designated as AjmGST1) by RACE approaches. The full-length cDNA of AjmGST1 was of 1296 bp encoded a protein of 169 amino acids residues. Multiple sequence alignment and phylogenetic analysis together supported that AjmGST1 belonged to a new member in invertebrates mGST family. Spatial expression analysis revealed that AjmGSTl was ubiquitously expressed in all examined tissues with the larger magnitude in tentacle. Time-course expression of AjmGST1 mRNA in coelomocytes was up-regulated after Vibrio splendidus challenge from 6 h until 72 h with the peak expression in 24 h, compared with that in the control group. Similarly, the induced expression of AjmGSTI expression was also detected in lipopolysaccharide (LPS) exposed primary coelomocytes. The purified recombinant protein of AjmGST1 showed high activity with GST substrate at pH of 7.0 and temperature of 35 degrees C. Meantime, the recombinant AjmGST1 depressed H2O2-induced MDA production both in vivo and in vitro. All of these results indicated that AjmGST1 was an important regulator in elimination of lipid peroxidation under immune response. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

In addition to the typical interstitial hydrogen in bond-centered sites (HBC) and zinc vacancy-hydrogen (VZn-nH) complexes, we reveal that nitrogen-related defects play a significant role on the physical properties of unintentionally doped ZnO NWs. We show by density functional theory that the VZn-NO-H defect complex acts as a deep acceptor with a relatively low formation energy and exhibits a prominent Raman line at 3078 cm(-1) along with a red-orange emission energy of similar to 1.82 eV in cathodoluminescence spectroscopy. The nature and concentration of the nitrogen- and hydrogen-related defects are found to be tunable using thermal annealing under oxygen atmosphere, but a rather complex, fine evolution including successive formation and dissociation processes is highlighted as a function of annealing temperature. ZnO NWs annealed at the moderate temperature of 300 degrees C specifically exhibit one of the smallest free charge carrier densities of 5.6 x 10(17) cm(-3) along with a high mobility of similar to 60 cm(2)/Vs following the analysis of longitudinal optical phonon-plasmon coupling. These findings report a comprehensive diagram showing the complex interplay of each nitrogen- and hydrogen-related defect during thermal annealing and its dependence on annealing temperature. They further reveal that the engineering of the nitrogen- and hydrogen-related defects as the major source of crystal defects in ZnO NWs grown by CBD is capital to precisely control their electronic structure properties governing their electrical and optical properties in any devices.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			2475-9953			WOS:000655935000002

The MISSR was performed in a room-temperature high-energy ball mill, using a mechanical alloying method. Whereas the glass transition temperature of the obtained glassy alloy is 681 K, the melting and liquidus temperatures are 1179 K and 1256 K, respectively. The mechanically alloyed Zr60Ni25Al15 glassy powders maintain its unique disordered structure through a large supercooled liquid region (99 K). It, however, transforms into a mixture of Zr5Ni4Al and Zr6NiAl2 crystalline phases at 780 K with a large enthalpy change of crystallization of -81.8 J/g. The possibility of devitrification of the synthetic glassy phase upon increasing the ball milling time was investigated. The results have shown that the glassy powder obtained after 173 ks of milling is subject to heavy lattice imperfections and tends to transform into a metastable-big cube phase after further ball milling times (216-259 ks). After 446 ks of milling, a complete glassy-metastable phase transformation is achieved and the end-product of this stage of milling is nanocrystalline big-cube powders which have a lattice constant of 1.2282 nm. The big-cube Zr(60)Ni(25)A(15) phase transforms into the same crystalline mixture of Zr5Ni4Al and Zr6NiAl2 phases at 799 K with an enthalpy change of transformation of -73.7 J/g. As the milling time increases (720 ks), the obtained big-cube phase can no longer withstand against the shear and impact stresses that are generated by the milling media and surprisingly transformed into a new metastable phase of nanocrystalline fcc- Zr60Ni25Al15. The lattice constant of this metastable phase was calculated and found to be 0.45449 nm. The fcc-metastable phase transforms into a mixture of Zr5Ni4Al and Zr6NiAl2 crystalline phases at rather a high temperature, as high as 901 K with a heat change of transformation of -24.4 J/g. The reported metastable phase here is new and has never been, so far as we know, reported for ternary Zr-Ni-Al system, or its binary phase relations. (C) 2003 Acta Materialia Inc.

To investigate the function of GPx in crustaceans, we cloned and characterized a full length GPx (MeGPx) transcript in the penaeid shrimp Metapenaeus ensis. Phylogenetic analysis showed that MeGPx clustered with the GPx from mollusks and nematodes and shared much higher similarity with vertebrate GPx3 and GPx5 than with GPx1 or GPx2. Multiple sequence alignment further demonstrated that MeGPx is evolutionarily conserved among invertebrates. with common functionally important motifs. MeGPx was specifically expressed in shrimp ovaries, but not in other tissues studied, including testis. In situ hybridization showed that MeGPx was highly expressed in pre-vitellogenic and mid-vitellogenic oocytes, while no expression was detected in late-vitellogenic oocytes. Moreover, real time PCR showed high level expression of MeGPx in the early ovaries. Since active protein synthesis and deposition occurred in mid-vitellogenic oocytes, MeGPx might play a pivotal role in preventing oocytes from oxidative damage and balancing ROS production. The present findings on shrimp GPx provide insights on the regulation of ROS in the ovarian maturation process and the role of GPx in crustacean reproductive biology. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc.

Other lumen proteins maintain photosynthetic activity through biogenesis and turnover of PSII complexes. Although all lumen proteins are soluble, these known details have highlighted interactions of some lumen proteins with thylakoid membranes or thylakoid-intrinsic proteins. Meanwhile, the functional details of most lumen proteins, as well as their distribution between the soluble and membrane-associated lumen fractions, remain unknown. The current study isolated the soluble free lumen (FL) and membrane-associated lumen (MAL) fractions from Arabidopsis thaliana, and used gel- and mass spectrometry-based proteomics methods to analyze the contents of each proteome. These results identified 60 lumenal proteins, and clearly distinguished the difference between the FL and MAL proteomes. The most abundant proteins in the FL fraction were involved in PSII assembly and repair, while the MAL proteome was enriched in proteins that support the oxygen-evolving complex (OEC). Novel proteins, including a new PsbP domain-containing isoform, as well as several novel post-translational modifications and N-termini, are reported, and bi-dimensional separation of the lumen proteome identified several protein oligomers in the thylakoid lumen.									2	0	0	0	2	0	2				1422-0067		WOS:000681924200001	34360890

We have studied kerogen and bitumen fractions from a coalification series from the New Zealand Coal Band covering the rank range from 0.28% to 0.80% vitrinite reflectance. We investigated the composition of fatty acids separated from the bitumen, and compared this to the distribution of kerogen-bound fatty acids (esters) obtained after selective chemical degradation of the macromolecular organic matter. We found remarkable differences in the fatty acid composition between bitumen and kerogen-bound acids, both in the short (<C-20) and long chain (<= C-20) fatty acid range. The compositions of these two acid fractions changed independently as a function of maturation. This points to the long and short chain fatty acids in bitumen and kerogen having different susceptibilities towards degradation, possibly as a result of their different solubilities in the pore water. The compositional differences may further reflect the occurrence of different types of bitumen e.g. if bitumen is trapped in organic micropores of the macromolecular network. Application of the carbon preference index for fatty acids (CPIFA) of bitumen and kerogen-bound acids revealed a linear correlation to the T-max maturity parameter. This shows that the CPIFA has a clear relation to thermal stability and, thus, reactivity of the buried organic matter. The difference in slopes of CPIFA vs. T-max for short and long chain as well as bitumen and kerogen-bound acids may indicate their different degradation susceptibilities. The short chain fatty acids of the bitumen show the highest susceptibility whereas the kerogen-bound long chain fatty acids seem to be most resistant towards diagenetic degradation.

Electrical measurements with the superior ferroelectric properties of high remanent polarization (P-r) and low coercive field (E-c) will be presented for thicknesses down to 50 nm. In order to decrease the thickness of electrically dense PZT thin films by the CSD method experiments have been performed by using different degrees of dilutions of the precursor stock solutions, i.e. instead of diluting the PZT stock solution with 2-butoxyethanol in the standard ratio of 1:1 before the spin-on process, the dilution is increased stepwise to a ratio of 1:4. In addition the films have been annealed in nitrogen atmosphere instead of the typical oxygen atmosphere which has been shown to strongly improve a preferential (111) orientation of the PZT film [G. J. Norga, L. Fe, Mat. Res. Soc. Symp. Proc. Vol. 655, CC9.1.1 (2001)]. The approach of Norga et al. is confirmed and complemented by means of electrical hysteresis measurements.

Its high oxidation states provide the possibility for ion intercalation and de-intercalation to the electrode material, which is truly advantageous for supercapacitor application. Herein, we report about reduced vertically aligned alpha-MoO3 nanoblades on conducting substrates via a posttreatment in reduced gas environments (H-2, N-2 and vacuum) to tune their conductivity by introducing oxygen vacancies. These alpha-MoO3 nanoblades were further carbonized through decomposition of glucose as a carbohydrate material to obtain binder-free carbon coated vertically aligned alpha-MoO3 electrode. As a binder-free supercapacitor negative electrode, the vacuum treated alpha-MoO3 electrode showed the highest specific capacitance (39.8 mF cm(-2)), as compared to that achieved by N-2 and H-2 treated samples (29.2 mF cm(-2) and 24.5 mF cm(-2), respectively). Besides, the vacuum annealed electrode also maintained around 76.4% of its initial specific capacitance value after 10,000 cycles indicating a more stable electrochemical performance of such electrode. An asymmetric device 3D-MnO2//alpha-MoO3 was assembled and it attained maximum specific capacitance value of 37.5 mF/cm(2) at current density value 1.5 mA cm(-2) and maximum energy density value of 16.875 mu Wh cm(-2) at power density value of 675 mu W cm(-2). The results demonstrate that the proposed hybrid synthesis approach is very promising for preparation of binder-free materials for high-performance supercapacitors. (C) 2022 Elsevier B.V.

However, few studies have investigated the genetic variation of these crustaceans. Water quality, morphometrics and genetic variation were determined for 1,219 individuals of M. lanchesteri from 11 provinces in Northeastern Thailand. Water quality analysis showed water temperature, pH, water hardness and dissolved oxygen as 25 to 33 degrees C, 6 to 9, 64 to 101 ml l(-1) and 4 to 7.5 ml l(-1) respectively. Water quality indicated that aquatic animals could live. Morphological characters showed total length as 1.5 to 4.5 cm with M. lanchesteri mean length of females higher than males in all 11 provinces. M. lanchesteri from Nong Khai presented the largest size with Buri Ram mostly comprising the smallest. Genetic variation was determined using the PCR-RFLP technique with five restriction enzymes as Dde I, Alu I, Hinf I, Bgl II and Hae III. Results showed one composite haplotype when samples were digested with Dde I, Alu I, Hinf I, Bgl II and Hae III, respectively, as AAAAA. A total of 9 haplotypes were detected. Nucleotide sequencing analysis found low genetic variation in populations of M. lanchesteri in Northeastern Thailand ranged from 0 to 0.035. Phylogenetic tree (UPGMA) construction determined that the M. lanchesteri population constituted two clades which all populations closely related apart from one separate population. This study can be used as a guideline for selection of commercial cultures by shrimp breeders and may also be useful for shrimp conservation.									4	0	0	0	4	0	4			2331-2025			WOS:000495044900001

Environmental water parameters (temperature, salinity, dissolved oxygen, and pH) were monitored, and zooplankton was collected. Samples were sectioned according to taxonomic groups (from Phylum to Family) for the detection of WSSV via PCR. A total of 52 zooplankton taxa were identified, of which crustaceans were the most abundant (82%). From the 228 WSSV diagnoses performed, 35% were positive. Moreover, from 32 taxa recorded at least one positive result was observed during the study, and only 13 were negative in all tests. The highest prevalence was observed in three taxa of copepods, brachyurous and bivalves. However, considering prevalence and frequency of occurrence, it was determined that up to 12 taxa could be considered as high-risk vectors. Finally, a significant correlation was found between the number of diagnoses per station with biovolume (rs=0.817) and taxa richness (rs=0.995). The results suggest that zooplankton diversity and abundance are associated with virus dispersion; moreover, these results demonstrated that the dispersion capacity of the virus through different taxa has been probably underestimated in recent years.									3	0	0	0	3	0	3			1355-557X	1365-2109		WOS:000417546400006

We cloned cDNA encoding hsp70 from the rotifer Asplanchna brightwelli. The full-length cDNA was 2134 bp and had an open reading frame of 1929 bp encoding 642 amino acids. The deduced amino acid sequence indicated that the Asphsp70 was a cytoplasmic protein and has the highest similarity 87% with Mus musculus, 86% identity with orthologs of Danio rerio, 84% with Apis mellifera and 81% with Xenopus laevis. Expression of Asphsp70 was analyzed under 1.25, 2.5, 5 and 10 mg/L paraquat and 6.25, 12.5, 25 and 50 mu g/L juglone. With paraquat, mRNA expression of Asphsp70 significantly increased immediately after exposure for 1 h (P < 0.05). Expression of Asphsp70 temporarily increased after exposure to 2.5 mg/L for 3 and 6 h, and after 10 mg/L for 3 h (P < 0.05). With exposure to 6.25 mu g/L juglone, mRNA for Asphsp70 significantly increased at 1, 3 and 12 h; with 12.5, 25 and 50 mu g/L, mRNA expression of Asphsp70 significantly increased immediately for 1 h (P < 0.05). These results indicated that the Asphsp70 gene was important in the response to oxidative stress.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1565-9801	2224-4662		WOS:000418887300008

An indigenous species in North America and the causal agent of pine wilt disease, B. xylophilus has devastated pine production in Southeastern Asia including Japan, China, and Korea since its initial introduction in the early 1900s. The reactive oxygen species (ROS) is the first line of defense utilized by host plants against parasites, while nematodes, counteractively, employ antioxidants to facilitate their infection. Peroxiredoxins (Prxs) are a large class of antioxidants recently found in a wide variety of organisms. In this report, a gene encoding a novel 2-cysteine peroxiredoxin protein in B. xylophilus was cloned and characterized. The 2-cysteine peroxiredoxin in B. xylophilus (herein refers to as "BxPrx") is highly conserved in comparison to 2-cysteine peroxiredoxins (Prx2s) in other nematodes, which have two conserved cysteine amino acids (Cp and Cr), a threonine-cysteine-arginine catalytic triad, and two signature motifs (GGLG and YF) sensitive to hydrogen peroxide. In silico assembly of BxPrx tertiary structure reveals the spatial configuration of these conserved domains and the simulated BxPrx 3-dimensional structure is congruent with its presumed redox functions. Although no signal peptide was identified, BxPrx was abundantly expressed and secreted under the B. xylophilus cuticle. Upon further analysis of this leader-less peptide, a single transmembrane a-helix composed of 23 consecutive hydrophobic amino acids was found in the primary structure of BxPrx. This transmembrane region and/or readily available ATP binding cassette transporters may facilitate the transport of non-classical BxPrx across the cell membrane. Recombinant BxPrx showed peroxidase activity in vitro reducing hydrogen peroxide using glutathione as the electron donor. The combined results from gene discovery, protein expression and distribution profiling (especially the "surprising" presence under the nematode cuticle), and recombinant antioxidant activity suggest that BxPrx plays a key role in combating the oxidative burst engineered by the ROS defense system in host plants during the infection process. In summary, BxPrx is a genetic factor potentially facilitating B. xylophilus infestation.									23	7	0	0	22	0	28			1449-2288			WOS:000208687900001	21814479

In addition, this enzyme plays crucial roles in plant developmental and environment responses, especially for the plastidic isoform. However, this isoform is less studied in C-3-C-4 intermediate species under drought and salt stresses than in C-3 and C-4 species. In the present study, we characterized SaNADP-ME4 from the intermediate woody desert species Salsola laricifolia. SaNADP-ME4 encoded a protein of 646 amino acids, which was found to be located in the chloroplasts based on confocal imaging. Quantitative real-time PCR analysis showed that SaNADP-ME4 was highly expressed in leaves, followed by stems and roots, and SaNADP-ME4 expression was improved and reached its maximum under the 200 mm mannitol and 100 mm NaCl treatments, respectively. Arabidopsis overexpressing SaNADP-ME4 showed increased root length and fresh weight under mannitol and salt stress conditions at the seedling stage. In the adult stage, SaNADP-ME4 could alleviate the decreased in chlorophyll contents and PSII photochemical efficiency, as well as improve the expression of superoxide dismutase, peroxidase, and pyrroline-5-carboxylate synthase genes to enhance reactive oxygen species scavenging capability and proline levels. Our results suggest that SaNADP-ME4 overexpression in Arabidopsis increases drought and salt stress resistance.									2	0	0	0	1	0	2				2223-7747		WOS:000701169300001	34579361

The n cycles of anodic potential scanning produced red-colored electrodeposited films of Film(dimer-L-n) in minutes with visible light harvesting characteristics akin to those previously observed for ruthenium polypyridyl complex star dye-based films that were much more costly and difficultly accessible. Film(dimer-L-n) films were found to exhibit surface-controlled thiophene unit associated redox behaviors and significant cathodic photocurrent generation properties. As irradiated with white light at 100 mW cm(-2) and biased at a zero potential, a Film(dimer-L-2)(-)modified ITO electrod exhibited a high photo-to-current conversion efficiency of 0.90% at 450 nm, and a photocurrent density of 13.6 mu A cm(-2) in an N-2-saturated electrolyte solution, which was greatly boosted by similar to 7 folds to 108.8 mu A cm(-2) in an O-2 -saturated electrolyte solution. The resulting modified electrodes offer great prospects for a wide range of applications ranging from photoelectric conversion to light detection devices to photoelectrocatalytic O-2 reduction and sensing.

J	Johll, ME; Johnson, DC								Anodic response of cystine at preanodized Au and Au-Ag electrodes in perchloric acid media								ELECTROANALYSIS				11	8			534	540						JUN 1999	1999	This study involves a comparison of the anodic response of the disulfide moiety of cystine at preanodized Au and Au-Ag rotated disk electrodes (RDEs). The goal of the study was the determination of beneficial effects that might result from the introduction of Ag-sites into Au surfaces. An anodic wave is observed for cystine at oxide covered Au and Au-Ag electrodes appearing as a shoulder to the wave for anodic discharge of H2O with evolution of O-2. Both the half-wave potential for the cystine wave (E-1/2,E-RSSR) and the overpotential for anodic evolution of O-2 (eta(O2) up arrow) are shifted by -3.6 mV per atomic percent Ag. These negative shifts are attributed to the higher rate of the anodic discharge of H2O at Ag sites in comparison to Au sites. Values for the apparent number of electrons (n(app)) transferred during oxidation of 1.0 mM cystine at 1.50 and 1.55 V (vs. SCE) are approximately 5 eq mol(-1) for Au and 6 eq mol(-1) for Au-80-Ag-20, as calculated from the slopes of Koutecky-Levich plots. The larger value of n(app) at the Au-Ag electrode is attributed to the higher rate for H2O discharge at the Ag sites. Cysteine sulfonic acid is identified as the product of extensive electrolysis (n = 10 eq mol(-1)) at a Au electrode. A preanodized Au electrode in a flow-through cell is demonstrated for cystine detection using a flow-injection system. A 6% loss in peak response observed over a 30-min period is attributed to the slow conversion of an active surface oxide, perhaps corresponding to the equivalent of a monolayer, to an inert oxide, probably corresponding to oxide coverage exceeding a monolayer.									6	0	0	0	4	0	6			1040-0397			WOS:000081368800002		
J	Banerjee, DPK; Ashok, NM; Launila, O; Davis, CJ; Varricatt, WP								A search for radioactive Al-26 in the nova- like variable V4332 Sagittarii								ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL				610	1			L29	L32		10.1086/423171				JUL 20 2004	2004	We have searched for the important radioactive isotope Al-26 in the nova-like source V4332 Sgr. Recent results from gamma-ray astronomy show that there is pervasive emission of the 1.809 MeV gamma-ray photon, arising from the decay of Al-26 to Mg-26, from all over the Galactic plane. Although the sites from where this emission originates are not clearly established, novae are believed to be an important contributing source. In this context, V4332 Sgr presented a rare opportunity to observationally investigate whether novae or nova-like sources synthesize Al-26 and to what extent. Strong AlO bands in the near-IR have been reported in this object recently. As molecular bands of different isotopic compositions are readily resolved spectroscopically (e.g., (CO)-C-12 and (CO)-C-13), it was thought that the components of AlO associated with Al-26 and stable Al-27 could be detected as separate bands. Our spectra indicate that there is no strong presence of Al-26 in V4332 Sgr. A reliable upper limit of 0.10 for the Al-26/Al-27 ratio is determined, which constitutes the first observational constraint for this ratio in a potential Al-26-producing source. While V4332 Sgr is not a typical nova, its outburst amplitude and light-curve behavior bear close similarity to that of novae. Hence, although the results from V4332 Sgr cannot be directly extended to novae in general, the limit on the observed Al-26/Al-27 ratio could be a useful input in constraining rather uncertain nucleosynthesis models for the production of Al-26 in novae/nova-like sources. When we compare the observed Al-26/Al-27 ratio in V4332 Sgr with that expected in classical novae, it appears unlikely that the progenitor of V4332 Sgr is an oxygen-neon-magnesium white dwarf.									16	0	0	0	3	0	16			0004-637X	1538-4357		WOS:000222701500008		
J	Yoshida, Takashi								Supernova mixtures reproducing isotopic ratios of presolar grains								ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL				666	2			1048	1068		10.1086/520631				SEP 10 2007	2007	Most of supernova- originating presolar grains, such as silicon carbide type X (SiC X) and low-density graphite, show excesses of Si-28. Some of them also indicate evidence for the original presence of short-lived nuclei Ti-44. In order to reproduce isotopic and elemental signatures of these grains, large-scale heterogeneous mixing in supernova ejecta is required. I investigate supernova mixtures that reproduce as many isotopic ratios as possible of 18 individual SiC X and 26 individual low-density graphite grains. The supernova ejecta are divided into seven layers, i.e., the Ni, Si/S, O/Si, O/Ne, C/O or O/C, He/C, and He/N layers. Then, mixtures indicating isotopic ratios with small differences from those of individual single grains are sought. Mixtures reproducing five isotopic ratios in C-12/C-13, N-14/N-15, Al-26/Al-27, Si-29/Si-28, Si-30/Si-28, and Ti-44/Ti-48 are obtained for three SiC grains. For 10 SiC X grains for which five, four, or three isotopic ratios have been measured, the mixtures reproducing all measured isotopic ratios are also found. For 20 low-density graphite grains, the mixtures reproducing six isotopic ratios in C-12/C-13, N-14/N-15, O-16/O-17, O-16/O-18, Al-26/Al-27, Si-29/Si-28, Si-30/Si-28, and Ti-44/Ti-48 are obtained. The mixing ratios of each mixture strongly depend on reproduced isotopic ratios. The main component of most mixtures is one of the Ni, He/C, and He/N layers. The carbon-to-oxygen ratio of the mixtures is larger than unity for most cases. The ratios of Fe/C and Fe/Si in the mixtures have large varieties. Most of the mixtures for low-density graphite indicate Fe/Si larger than unity. The elemental signatures of the mixtures will constrain grain formation in supernovae.									17	0	0	0	1	0	17			0004-637X	1538-4357		WOS:000249305700034

The digester has been modelled as two completely mixed tanks associated with gaseous and liquid volumes. The conversion model has been developed based on a plant wide modelling methodology (PWM) and comprises biochemical transformations, physicochemical reactions and thermodynamic considerations. The model predicts the reactor temperature and the temporary evolution of an extensive vector of model components which are completely defined in terms of elemental mass fractions (C, H, O, N and P) and charge density. Thus, the comprehensive definition of the model components guarantees the continuity of elemental mass and charge in all the model transformations and between any two systems defined by the model. The aim of the generic digester model is to overcome the problems that arise when trying to connect aerobic and anaerobic digestion processes working in series or to connect water and sludge lines in a WWTP. The modelling methodology used has allowed the systematic construction of the biochemical model which acts as an initial illustrative example of an application that has been experimentally verified. The variation of the temperature is also predicted based on a thermal dynamic model. Real data from four different facilities and a straightforward calibration have been used to successfully verify the model predictions in the cases of mesophilic and thermophilic anaerobic digestion as well as autothermal thermophilic aerobic digestion (ATAD). The large amount of data from the full scale ATAD and the anaerobic digestion pilot plants, all of them working under different conditions, has allowed the validation of the model for that case study.

Herein, fabrication of indirect and noble metal-free Z-scheme photocatalytic architecture is demonstrated using pulsed laser ablation in liquids (PLAL) technique for the first time. The as-prepared ternary photocatalyst (denoted as TiO2/rGO/g-C3N4) comprises titanium dioxide (TiO2) nanotubes, reduced graphene oxide (rGO) nanosheets, and graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) nanosheets. The photocatalytic activity of the as-synthesized composite is evaluated by monitoring water splitting. Various analytical techniques were employed to investigate the compositional, morphological, structural, and optical properties of the photocatalysts. The system of TiO2/rGO/g-C3N4 with the weight ratio of TiO2 to g-C3N4 of 2:4 and 1% rGO exhibited the highest hydrogen production rate of 32 +/- 1 mmol g(-1)h(-1), which is about 93, 3.8 and 2.6 times higher than those of pure g-C3N4, TiO2, and TiO2/rGO, respectively. This enhanced performance can be ascribed to the strong interfacial bonding (TiO2/rGO/g-C3N4), extended visible light absorption capacity due to higher photo-responsiveness of rGO and g-C3N4, the synergetic effect between TiO2 and g-C3N4 and direct contact between TiO2 and rGO which facilitated efficient separation and transfer of photogenerated charges. This study opens opportunities for the fabrications of different Z-scheme systems for various applications.									24	0	0	0	3	0	24			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000582367700025

These include the following: 1) a reduced rate of C-13 enrichment at glutamate C3 and C4; 2) a near coalescence of the C3 and C4 fractional enrichment curves; 3) a dramatic alteration in the time-dependent evolution of the glutamate C4 multiplets, C4S and C4D34; and 4) a decrease in the NMR visibility of glutamate. A fit of the C-13 fractional enrichment curves of glutamate C4 and C3 in the absence of inhibitor to a kinetic model of the TCA cycle gave values for transaminase flux of 7.5 mu mol.min(-1).g dry wt(-1) and TCA cycle flux of 7.5 mu mol.min(-1).g dry wt-l, thereby confirming reports by others that the kinetics of C-13 enrichment of glutamate C3 and C4 in heart tissue is significantly affected by flux through reactions other than TCA cycle. The C-13 fractional enrichment data collected in the presence of 0.5 mM AOA could not be fitted using this same kinetic model. However, kinetic simulations demonstrated that the time-dependent changes in C4S and C4D34 are only consistent with a 10-fold reduction in the size of intermediate pools undergoing rapid turnover in the TCA cycle. We conclude that inhibition of glutamic-oxalacetic transaminase by AOA effectively reduces the size of the alpha-ketoglutarate pool in rapid exchange with the TCA cycle. Our data indicate that changes in glutamate multiplet areas in the C-13 NMR spectra of heart (as demonstrated by glutamate C4S and C4D34) are more sensitive to alterations in metabolic pool sizes in exchange with the TCA cycle than are measurements of C-13 fractional enrichment at glutamate C3 and C4.									27	0	2	0	19	0	30			0363-6135	1522-1539		WOS:000071868500027

Two-domain laccases have unusual thermostability, resistance to inhibitors and an alkaline optimum of activity. The causes of these properties in two-domain laccases are poorly understood. A recombinant two-domain laccase (SgfSL) was cloned from the genome of Streptomyces griseoflavus Ac-993, expressed in Escherichia coli and purified to homogeneity. The crystals of SgfSL belonged to the monoclinic space group P2(1), with unit-cell parameters a = 74.64, b = 94.72, c = 117.40 angstrom, beta = 90.672 degrees, and diffraction data were collected to 2.0 A angstrom resolution using a synchrotron-radiation source. Two functional trimers per asymmetric unit correspond to a Matthews coefficient of 1.99 angstrom 3 Da(-1) according to the monomer molecular weight of 35.6 kDa.									5	1	0	0	4	0	6				2053-230X		WOS:000360652600015	26323308

The direct all-solid-state p-n ZCH shows the best prospect, but its fabrication mechanism, especially function of the interfacial electric field (IEF) was rarely expounded explicitly. Herein, a direct all-solid-state p-n copper indium disulfide/tungsten oxide (CIS/WO) ZCH was prepared through a facile hydrothermal process for the first time. The CIS/WO ZCH exhibits enhanced photocatalytic activity because of significantly accelerated photogenerated charge separation via a Z-scheme charge migration process. The Z-scheme charge transfer pathway is inferred from matched energy band levels of CIS and WO and the IEF is confirmed to play a key role. The CIS/WO ZCH can fast produce singlet oxygen via hole oxidation of superoxide radicals under visible light irradiation, while pure CIS and WO cannot, effectively verifying the Z-scheme charge transfer process. This work illustrates the principle for fabrication of the direct all-solid-state p-n ZCH and function of the IEF, as well as provides a new ZCH. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Herein, a simple synthesis of the nanoporous RuO2 (NP-RuO2) characterized by RuO (OH)(2) surface phase was reported. The physical characterization of the materials are achieved by transmission electron microscope (TEM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray fluorescence (XRF) and X-ray photoelectron spectrometer (XPS). For HER activity, the NP-RuO2-450 electrode only needs 87 mV overpotential to obtain a current density of 10 mA cm(-2), while RuO2 generates the same current density at a relatively large overpotential (eta = 142 mV). Notably, the HER activity of NP-RuO2-450 is also higher than that of Pt (10 mA cm(-2), eta = 103 mV). The specific activity of NP-RuO2-450 is still 2.4 times higher than that of RuO2 reflecting the enhancement of the intrinsic activity. The OER activity of NP-RuO2-450 electrode has outperformed that of RuO2. The apparent activity of NP-RuO2-450 is 3.5 times that of RuO2 at an overpotential of 270 mV. For the specific activity, NP-RuO2-450 is still 1.9 times higher than that of RuO2. Therefore, NP-RuO2-450 electrode could be used as a bifunctional catalyst for overall water splitting. The excellent HER and OER activities of the NP-RuO2-450 electrode could be attributed to the enhancement of electrochemical surface area of electrode material. However, the more important reason is that the new surface phase creation of hydroxides and the electronic structure modification of Ru.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			1572-6657	1873-2569		WOS:000648498200020

Unfortunately, Romania is in the situation so as the waste landfilling is still considered as a suitable solution for waste management. European Union imposed a number of regulations and programs in the field of waste treatment and management that Romania must comply.The paper describes some aspects regarding characterization of the leachate originating from the Tomesti landfill (situated in Iasi County, Romania) as well as quality assessment on the local environment considering the results of this research.One of the most important problems with designing and maintaining a landfill is managing the leachate that is generated when water passes through the waste. Tests performed on the old landfill in Iasi County have shown that the organic components and heavy metals present in the leachate that penetrates through infiltrations in soil induce impacts and risks in environment, so that European norms which have to be applied for the new landfill need to solve this problem.The experimental results showed that most of the parameters examined in the leachate samples such as colour, BOD, pH, heavy metals concentration were found at high levels. Therefore, the storage of any waste material in the landfill poses environmental problems. It was found that the chemical quality of leachate varies as a function of a number of factors including the original nature of the buried waste materials and the various chemical and biochemical reactions that may occur as the waste materials decompose, seasonal evolution etc. The impact the leachate induced in the environmental components was assessed and the results showed that contamination of soil, groundwater and surface water that may occur as leachate produced by water or liquid wastes moving into, through and out of the landfill, migrates into adjacent areas can affect in a major degree the site characteristics as well as the environmental health.These data were considered when the new landfill was decided to be designed and built according EU norms.					5th International Conference on Environmental Engineering and Management (ICEEM 05)5th International Conference on Environmental Engineering and Management (ICEEM 05)	SEP 15-19, 2009SEP 15-19, 2009	Gheorghe Asachi Tech Univ Lasi, Fac Chem Engn & Environm Protect; Dept Environm Engn & Management; Pannon Univ VeszpremGheorghe Asachi Tech Univ Lasi, Fac Chem Engn & Environm Protect; Dept Environm Engn & Management; Pannon Univ Veszprem	Tulcea, ROMANIATulcea, ROMANIA	21	0	0	0	3	0	21			1582-9596	1843-3707		WOS:000272499300022

Reflectance spectroscopy of ilmenites and related Ti and Ti-Fe oxides (200 to 2500 nm): Spectral-compositional-structural relationships								ICARUS				362						114423	10.1016/j.icarus.2021.114423		MAR 2021		JUL 1 2021	2021	Ilmenite is an important mineral for understanding lunar evolution. Ilmenite is also a primary ore of titanium on the Earth. Here we present a comprehensive examination of the spectral-compositional-structural relationships of ilmenites and related Fe-Ti oxides. Ilmenite spectral features of interest include maxima near similar to 250 nm (due Ti4+-O and Fe2+-O charge transfers), similar to 335 nm (due to Fe2+-Ti4+ charge transfer), and 950 nm (interband maximum), and absorption features near similar to 540 nm (due to Fe2+-Ti4+ charge transfers), similar to 630 nm (due to Ti3+Ti4+ charge transfers), and a similar to 1300/1600 nm absorption doublet (due to Fe2+ crystal field transitions). Absorption features transition from Fresnel peaks to valley around 400 nm, as absorption coefficients decrease toward longer wavelengths. Ilmenite powders are generally darkest and show the greatest spectral contrast and reflectance rise beyond similar to 1300 nm for the smallest grain sizes. Other Ti and Fe-Ti oxides share some spectral properties with ilmenites but also exhibit many differences. The most common feature they share is a rise in reflectance toward shorter wavelengths below similar to 500 nm (i.e., blue spectral slope). Ti +/- Fe oxide spectra can also exhibit absorption features attributable to Ti, Fe, and Ti +/- Fe, and these features vary in intensity, shape and wavelength position due to factors such as Ti and Fe oxidation states, coordination environment, and nearest neighbor cation types. Ilmenite differs most from silicates in the region below similar to 500 nm: it shows a reflectance increase versus decrease toward shorter wavelengths for silicates, as well as diagnostic Ti/Ti-Fe maxima or minima. Thus, detection of ilmenite in mixtures is best accomplished by including the UV region in spectral analysis. With increasing ilmenite in mixtures, its diagnostic spectral features become increasingly apparent.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			0019-1035	1090-2643		WOS:000639154900010

We found room-temperature ferroelectric polarization and ferromagnetism for higher amount of iron ions(y >= 0.04). The paraelectric-ferroelectric phase transition occurred between 650 and 670 K for 0 <= y <= 0.05. Ferromagnetic hysteresis was measured at different temperatures on samples with y >= 0.04. Detailed structural analysis evidenced the variation of unit cell parameters with y increasing, confirming the substitution of the iron element in the lattice. Fe-57 Mtissbauer spectroscopy evidenced that iron ions occupy Ti positions in the perovskite lattice, with the oxidation state Fe3+ and two coordination types. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy confirmed the presence of iron only as Fe3+ and, moreover, evidenced the presence of a substantial amount of Ti3+ ions in the structure. The presence of both Fe3+ (spin 5/2) in different coordinations as well as Ti3+ (spin 1/2) magnetic ions in B-site positions drives the occurrence of magnetic properties from low temperature to above room temperature, through superexchange Fe3+-O-Fe3+, Fe3+-O-Ti3+ and Ti3+-O-Ti3+ interactions.

J	Xu, Changfan; Zhan, Jing; Wang, Huanwei; Kang, Yao; Liang, Feng								Dense binary Fe-Cu sites promoting CO2 utilization enable highly reversible hybrid Na-CO2 batteries								JOURNAL OF MATERIALS CHEMISTRY A				9	38			22114	22128		10.1039/d1ta06611k		AUG 2021		OCT 5 2021	2021	High-performance and low-cost catalysts are particularly desirable for the exploitation of practical low-overpotential Na-CO2 batteries with protracted cyclability. Herein, a well-defined morphology of nitrogen-rich graphitic carbon frameworks with dense bimetallic active sites (Fe-Cu-N-C) was facilely prepared by introducing Fe3+ and Cu2+ to regulate in situ grown carbon nanotubes as an advanced catalyst toward hybrid Na-CO2 batteries. Through metal content tuning and carbon architecture altering, Fe-Cu-N-C proved to be dramatically more effective than Cu-N-C and Fe-N-C. As the cathodic catalyst of a hybrid Na-CO2 battery, Fe-Cu-N-C can facilitate the fast evolution and degradation of flocculent discharge products and achieve an excellent long-term cyclability with up to 1550 cycles (over 600 h), which makes it one of the greatest catalysts for hybrid Na-CO2/air batteries that have been reported to date. The observed outstanding battery performance is attributable to the cross-linked conductive framework affording a "highway" for accelerated electron transport and Na+/CO2 diffusion. Besides, the synergistic effects among defect-rich interfaces, Fe/Fe3C nanocrystals, and Fe-N-x and Cu-N-x sites derived from nitrogen atom doping enhance the catalytic activity. In addition, the possible growth and decomposition mechanisms of NaHCO3 products with different morphologies on Fe-N-C, Cu-N-C, and Fe-Cu-N-C electrodes were presented and discussed.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000698441500001		
J	Katz, Yael S.; Galili, Gad; Amir, Rachel								Regulatory role of cystathionine-gamma-synthase and de novo synthesis of methionine in ethylene production during tomato fruit ripening								PLANT MOLECULAR BIOLOGY				61	1-2			255	268		10.1007/s11103-006-0009-8				MAY 2006	2006	The essential amino acid methionine is a substrate for the synthesis of S-adenosyl-methionine (SAM), that donates its methyl group to numerous methylation reactions, and from which polyamines and ethylene are generated. To study the regulatory role of methionine synthesis in tomato fruit ripening, which requires a sharp increase in ethylene production, we cloned a cDNA encoding cystathionine gamma-synthase (CGS) from tomato and analysed its mRNA and protein levels during tomato fruit ripening. CGS mRNA and protein levels peaked at the "turning" stage and declined as the fruit ripened. Notably, the tomato CGS mRNA level in both leaves and fruit was negatively affected by methionine feeding, a regulation that Arabidopsis, but not potato CGS mRNA is subject to. A positive correlation was found between elevated ethylene production and increased CGS mRNA levels during the ethylene burst of the climacteric ripening of tomato fruit. In addition, wounding of pericarp from tomato fruit at the mature green stage stimulated both ethylene production and CGS mRNA level. Application of exogenous methionine to pericarp of mature green fruit increased ethylene evolution, suggesting that soluble methionine may be a rate limiting metabolite for ethylene synthesis. Moreover, treatment of mature green tomato fruit with the ethylene-releasing reagent Ethephon caused an induction of CGS mRNA level, indicating that CGS gene expression is regulated by ethylene. Taken together, these results imply that in addition to recycling of the methionine moieties via the Yang pathway, operating during synthesis of ethylene, de novo synthesis of methionine may be required when high rates of ethylene production are induced.									35	1	0	0	32	0	37			0167-4412	1573-5028		WOS:000238446100018	16786305

On the basis of the detailed investigation, the solubility limits of tungsten (W6+) ion and associated effects on the crystal structure, morphology, and optical properties of W-doped Ga2O3 (Ga2-2xWxO3, 0.00 <= x <= 0.25, GWO) compounds are reported. GWO materials were synthesized via a conventional solid-state reaction route, where a two-step calcination is adopted to produce materials with a high structural and chemical quality. X-ray diffraction analyses of sintered GWO compounds reveal the formation of a solid solution of GWO compounds at lower concentrations W (x <= 0.10), while unreacted WO3 secondary phase formation occurs at higher concentrations (x>0.10). Insolubility of W at higher concentrations (x > 0.15) is attributed to the difference in formation enthalpies of respective oxides, i.e., Ga2O3 and WO3. GWO compounds exhibit an interesting trend in morphology evolution as a function of W content. While intrinsic Ga2O3 exhibits rod-shaped morphology, W-doped Ga2O3 compounds exhibit nearly spherical-shaped grain morphology. Increasing W content (x > 0.10) induces morphology transformation from spherical to faceted grains with different facets (square and hexagonal). Relatively larger grain sizes in GWO compounds might be attributed to vacancy assisted enhanced mass transport due to W incorporation and/or WO3 induced liquid phase sintering. Our findings demonstrate a substantial red shift in band gap (E-g), which is evident from the optical absorption spectra, enabling the wide spectral selectivity of GWO compounds. W Sd orbitals induced sp-d exchange interaction between valence band and conduction band electrons accounts for the substantial red shift in E-g of GWO compounds. Also, with increasing W, E-g decreases linearly, obeying Vegard law up to x = 0.15 and, at this point, an abrupt E-g drop prevails. The nonlinearity (bowing effect) behavior in E-g beyond x = 0.15 is due to insolubility of W at higher concentrations. The fundamental scientific understanding of the interdependence of synthetic conditions, structure, chemistry, and band gap could be useful to optimize GWO materials for optical, optoelectronic, and photocatalytic device applications.									13	0	0	0	1	0	13			0020-1669	1520-510X		WOS:000461978700022	30844255	
J	Managadze, G.								Plasma and collision processes of hypervelocity meteorite impact in the prehistory of life								INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ASTROBIOLOGY				9	3			157	174		10.1017/S147355041000008X				JUL 2010	2010	A new concept is proposed, according to which the plasma and collision processes accompanying hypervelocity impacts of meteorites can contribute to the arising of the conditions on early Earth, which are necessary for the appearance of primary forms of living matter. It was shown that the processes necessary for the emergence of living matter could have started in a plasma torch of meteorite impact and have continued in an impact crater in the case of the arising of the simplest life form.It is generally accepted that planets are the optimal place for the origin and evolution of life. In the process of forming the planetary systems the meteorites, space bodies feeding planet growth, appear around stars. In the process of Earth's formation, meteorite sizes ranged from hundreds and thousands of kilometres. These space bodies consisted mostly of the planetesimals and comet nucleus. During acceleration in Earth's gravitational field they reached hypervelocity and, hitting the surface of planet, generated powerful blowouts of hot plasma in the form of a torch. They also created giant-size craters and dense dust clouds. These bodies were composed of all elements needed for the synthesis of organic compounds, with the content of carbon being up to 5%-15%.A new idea of possible synthesis of the complex organic compounds in the hypervelocity impact-generated plasma torch was proposed and experimentally confirmed. A previously unknown and experimentally corroborated feature of the impact-generated plasma torch allowed a new concept of the prehistory of life to be developed. According to this concept the intensive synthesis of complex organic compounds arose during meteoritic bombardment in the first 0.5 billion years at the stage of the planet's formation. This most powerful and destructive action in Earth's history could have played a key role and prepared conditions for the origin of life.In the interstellar gas-dust clouds, the synthesis of simple organic matter could have been explained by an identical process occurring in the plasma torch of hypervelocity collisions between submicron size dust particles. It is assumed that the processes occurred in the highly unbalanced hot plasma simultaneously with the synthesis of simple and complicated organic compounds, thereby ensuring their ordering and assembly.Bona fide experimental evidence presented below indicates that the physical fields generated in the plasma environment in the process of the formation and expansion of the torch meet the main requirements toward "true" local chiral fields. These fields were very likely to be capable to trigger the initial, weak breaking of enantiomer symmetry and determine the "sign" of the asymmetry of the bioorganic world.These fields could have worked as "trapping" fields influencing spontaneous processes occurring in highly overheated and nonequilibrium plasma in the state that is far from the thermodynamical branch of equilibrium and may have contributed to the formation of an environment needed for the synthesis of homochiral molecular structures, which, in turn, were needed for the emergence of the primary forms of living matter.It has been shown experimentally that the plasma-chemical processes in the torch have high catalytic properties and assure the rise of the chemical reaction rates by 10-100 million times. In the process of the plasma flyaway this in turn can assure the fast formation of simple and complicated organic compounds, including hyper-branched polymers. It is possible to assume that predominantly inorganic substances from meteorites were used for the synthesis of complicated organic compounds on early Earth.A laboratory experiment with hypervelocity impact plasma torch modelling by a laser with a Q-switch mode has shown the possibility of high-molecular organic compound synthesis, with mass of approximately 5000 a.m.u. by meteorite impact with an effective diameter of 100 mkm. The target contained only H, C, N and O elements in inorganic forms. The approximation of the curve received in these experiments has shown that molecular structures comparable in mass with the protoviroid (a hypothetical primogenitor of the biosphere) and could have been synthesized as a result of the impact of a meteorite of a millimetre-size range.Observable characteristics of the synthesis processes suggest high catalytic activity of the plasma medium and high speed of plasma-chemical reactions, combined with ordering and assemblage processes. This suggests that the plasma torch with a huge local density of energy and matter may be the optimal medium for the synthesis of complex organic compounds needed for prebiotic evolution and the development of the primary form of living matter.A new view of the impact crater provides the most interesting and unexpected consequence of the concept proposed. When considering the problem, it became evident that at a prebiotic stage of evolution there should be an environment in which a photogenic creature could have survived. The crater of the meteoric impact, which is capable of producing 'a primogenitor of the biosphere' environment sated with organic matter, moderate temperature and water for considerable time and becoming 'a life cradle', appears to be such an environment.Having enormous energy, the meteorite impact is capable of injecting the newly created complicated organic compounds deep into the space body surfaces, including subsurface water reservoirs, such as Europe, Enchilada and Titan. In this case the meteorite impact has no natural alternative in the creation of initial conditions for the origin of extraterrestrial life. This possibility was confirmed by a laboratory impact model experiment, in which the plasma torch was created under the water surface.The concept proposed is based on physical processes occurring in nature and on experimental results of impact experiments and subsequent modelling of their analogues in laboratory conditions. Thus, the realizability and survivability of this concept should be taken as well grounded due to the simplicity and clarity of the physical processes.									5	0	0	0	1	0	5			1473-5504			WOS:000278918700003

In this study, we showed a mild and highly efficient way to build a type of polymer-living cell conjugates based on photoinduced electron transfer-reversible addition-fragmentation chain-transfer polymerization (PET-RAFT). The polymerization could proceed at room temperature under the blue light initiating and showed very less influence on the activity of the living cells. Significantly, the constructed positively charged polymer-living cell conjugates could aggregate with the negatively charged nativeChlorella pyrenoidosa(CP) cell to form a microscale aggregate which then allowed a functionality switching of the encapsulated CP cells from the normal photosynthetic O(2)towards H(2)production with an average rate of 0.26 mu mol H(2)h(-1)(mg chlorophyll)(-1)for 42 h. It is then anticipated that the method we show could contribute an effective way for generating different functionalized living cell polymer hybrid structures on demand, and the demonstrated aggregation induced functionality switching of the CP cells is also anticipated to inspire more applications of the cell based materials towards biology green energy.									5	0	0	0	1	0	5			1674-7321	1869-1900		WOS:000551403500003

These materials were cold-pressed in the form of disk electrodes and used to electrolyze a chlorate electrolyte that does not contain dichromate or chromate ions. The OCl- concentration in the electrolyte was measured with respect to the electrolysis time for a variety of composite electrodes prepared by varying the milling time, t(m). In all cases, the OCl- decomposition rate, d[OCl-]/dt, was calculated from the slope of the [OCl-] vs time curve. In the case of nanocrystalline Ti: Ru: Fe: O mixed with Cr-0, d[OCl-]/dt decreases from 0.26 to 0.14 mM/ h as t(m) increases from 0 to 2 h. For t(m) > 2 h, the decomposition rate increases to 0.20 mM/ h. In the case of nanocrystalline Ti: Ru: Fe: O mixed with Cr2O3, d [OCl-]/dt is only marginally affected for t(m) < 2 h, while it reaches a value as high as 0.39 mM/ h after 5 h of milling. Through a detailed structural and surface analysis performed by using X-ray diffraction, energy-dispersive X-ray analysis, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, it is shown that a chromium hydroxide layer is formed at the surface of the electrodes even if the electrolysis is conducted in a chlorate electrolyte that does not contain dichromate or chromate ions. This arises due to dissolution of Cr species in the electrolyte and their redeposition at the electrode surface under cathodic polarization. The reasons underlying the different behavior of composite electrodes made with Cr-0 instead of Cr2O3 are discussed.

During atmospheric transport, fresh acidic BB-HULIS in droplets and humid aerosols are subject to neutralization and pH-modified aging process. In this study, solutions containing HULIS isolated from wood smoldering emissions were first adjusted with NaOH and NH3 to pH values in the range of 3.6-9.0 and then aged under oxic dark conditions. Evolution of HULIS oxidative potential (OP) and total peroxide content (equivalent H2O2 concentration, H(2)O(2)eq) were measured together with the changes in solution absorbance and chemical composition. Notable immediate responses such as peroxide generation, HULIS autoxidation, and an increase in OP and light absorption were observed under alkaline conditions. Initial H(2)O(2)eq, OP, and absorption increased exponentially with pH, regardless of the alkaline species added. Dark aging further oxidized the HULIS and led to pH-dependent toxic and chemical changes, exhibiting an alkaline-facilitated initial increase followed by a decrease of OP and H(2)O(2)eq. Although highly correlated with HULIS OP, the contributions of H(2)O(2)eq to OP are minor but increased both with solution pH and dark aging time. Alkalinity-assisted autoxidation of phenolic compounds and quinoids with concomitant formation of H2O2 and other alkalinity-favored peroxide oxidation reactions are proposed here for explaining the observed HULIS OP and chemical changes in the dark. Our findings suggest that alkaline neutralization of fresh BB-HULIS represents a previously overlooked peroxide source and pathway for modifying aerosol redox-activity and composition. Additionally, these findings imply that the lung fluid neutral environment can modify the OP and peroxide content of inhaled BB-HULIS. The results also suggest that common separation protocols of HULIS using base extraction methods should be treated with caution when evaluating and comparing their composition, absorption, and relative toxicity.									2	0	0	0	1	0	2			0048-9697	1879-1026		WOS:000832997200011	35460777	
J	Szalai, VA; Brudvig, GW					Szalai, Veronika/0000-0002-1115-2849			Reversible binding of nitric oxide to tyrosyl radicals in photosystem II. Nitric oxide quenches formation of the S3 EPR signal species in acetate-inhibited photosystem II								BIOCHEMISTRY				35	47			15080	15087		10.1021/bi961117w				NOV 26 1996	1996	Continuous illumination at temperatures above 350 K of photosystem II samples which have been depleted of calcium or chloride or treated with fluoride, acetate. or ammonia results in production of a broad radical EPR signal centered at g = 2.0. This EPR signal, called the S3 EPR signal, has been attributed to an organic radical interacting with the St state of the oxygen-evolving complex to give the species S(2)X(+) (X(+) = organic radical), A tyrosine radical has been proposed as the species responsible for the S3 EPR signal, On the basis of experiments demonstrating that nitric oxide binds reversibly to the tyrosyl radical in ribonucleotide reductase, nitric oxide has been used to probe the S3 EPR signal in acetate-treated photosystem II, In experiments using manganese-depleted photosystem II, nitric oxide was found to bind reversibly to both redox-active tyrosines, Y-D(.) and Y-Z(.), to form EPR-silent adducts, Next, acetate-treated photosystem II was illuminated to form the S3 EPR signal in the presence of nitric oxide to test whether the S3 EPR signal behaves like Y-Z(.). Under conditions that produce the maximum yield of the S3 EPR signal in acetate-treated photosystem II no S3 EPR signal was observed in the presence of nitric oxide. Upon removal of nitric oxide, the S3 EPR signal could be induced. Quenching of the S3 EPR signal by nitric oxide yielded an S-2-state multiline EPR signal, Its amplitude was 45% of that found for uninhibited photosystem II illuminated at 200 K: this yield is the same as the yield of the S3 EPR signal under equivalent conditions but without nitric oxide, These results suggest that the S3 EPR signal is due to the configuration S2YZ. in which the S-2 state of the oxygen-evolving complex gives a broadened multiline EPR signal as a result oi exchange and dipolar interactions with Y-Z(.). The binding of nitric oxide to Y-Z(.) to form a diamagnetic Y-Z-NO species uncouples the S-2 state from Y-Z(.), yielding a noninteracting S-2-state multiline EPR signal species.									62	0	0	0	42	0	62			0006-2960			WOS:A1996VV23700050	8942675

In the absence of DCMU, the doublet signal decayed (t(1/2) similar to 7 min) during subsequent dark incubation at 273 K and the multiline signal was regenerated to the original amplitude with the same kinetics of the doublet decay. In the presence of DCMU, the doublet signal decayed much faster (t(1/2) - 1 min) by charge recombination with Q(A)(-), while the time course of the multiline recovery was inherently identical with that observed in the absence of DCMU. A simple theoretical consideration indicates the direct conversion from the doublet-signal state to the multiline state with no intermediate state between them. Lengthy dark storage at 77 K led to disappearance of the DCMU-affected doublet signal and a Fe2+/Q(A)(-) electron spin resonance (ESR) signal, but no recovery of the multiline signal. Notably, the multiline signal was restored by subsequent dark incubation at 273 K. The charge recombination between Q-A and the doublet signal species led to a thermoluminescence band at 7 degreesC in a medium at pH 5.5. The peak position shifted to 17 degreesC at pH 7.0, presumably due to a pH-dependent change in the redox property of a donorside radical species responsible for the doublet signal. Based on these results, redox events in the Ca2+-depleted PS II are discussed in contradistinction with the normal processes in oxygen-evolving PS II. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V.

However, there are still a few remaining challenges to develop wide-light-absorption and stable photocatalysts for the simultaneous production of H-2 and O-2 in pure water without sacrificial reagents. Herein, we report the design and preparation of Z-scheme TiO2/ZnTe/Au nanocorncob heterojunctions by homogeneously decorating Au nanoparticles onto the surface of core-shell TiO2/ZnTe coaxial nanorods for highly efficient overall water splitting. With the appropriate band structure of TiO2/ZnTe heterojunctions and the surface plasmon resonance enhancement of Au nanoparticles, the well-designed TiO2/ZnTe/Au nanocorncob heterojunctions can synergistically make effective utilization of broad-range solar light illunimation and enhance the separation efficency of electron-hole pairs, as evidenced by UV-Vis absorption and time-resolved photoluminescence spectroscopy. Photoelectrochemical characterization confirms that the water-splitting reaction on TiO2/ZnTe/Au nanocorncobs is mainly carried out via a two-electron/two-electron transfer process with an intermediate product of H2O2. As a result, the TiO2/ZnTe/Au nanocorncob photocatalyst can generate H-2 and O-2 with a stoichiometric ratio of 2:1 under light irradiation without any sacrificial agents, exhibiting a high H-2 production rate of 3344.0 mol g(-1) h(-1) and a solar-to-hydrogen (STH) efficiency of 0.98%. Moreover, the TiO2/ZnTe/Au nanocorncob heterojunctions show high stability and well-preserved morphological integrity after long-term photocatalytic tests. This study provides a prototype route to produce clean hydrogen energy from only sunlight, pure water, and rationally-designed heterojunction photocatalysts.									47	6	0	0	4	0	48			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000469245300040	31025687

The vertical distribution of Hg-T, MeHg, acid volatile sulfide, total S, Fe, Mn, Al and organic C were also determined in dated sediment cores from the same lake basins and from the deepest site of two other lakes, one also located in the Canadian Shield and the other in the Northeastern part of the Appalachian Mountains. Application of a one-dimensional transport-reaction equation to the dissolved Hg-T and MeHg profiles constrains the depth intervals (zones) where these species are produced or consumed in the sedimentary column and yields estimates of net reaction rates of Hg-T or MeHg in each of the zones as well as their fluxes at the sediment-water interface.Dissolved Hg-T and MeHg diffused from the overlying water into the sediments, except for MeHg at one of the sampling dates in the perennially oxygenated basin. About 97% and 50% of the MeHg flux to the sediments is presently deposited with settling particles in the perennially oxygenated and seasonally anoxic basins, respectively. Removal of porewater Hg-T and MeHg occurred at all dates and sampling sites. Comparison of the consumption zones of porewater Hg-T and MeHg with the profiles of ancillary parameters, coupled with thermodynamic calculations, suggest that pure Hg mineral phases do not form in the sediments, that Hg-T and MeHg adsorption onto authigenic Fe oxyhydroxides occurs in minor proportions, and that the association of Hg-T and MeHg to Fe sulfide phases or sulfidized organic matter is possible. Assuming that the net consumption of MeHg in the porewaters was essentially due to demethylation, an apparent first-order rate constant for MeHg demethylation of 0.04-0.8 d(-1) was estimated. Production of porewater MeHg occurred only in the perennially oxygenated basin, at sediment depths where SO4 was consumed. Assuming that the net production of porewater MeHg was essentially due to methylation, an apparent first-order rate constant for Hg methylation ranging between 0.006 d(-1) and 0.1 d(-1) was calculated. These field-derived Hg methylation and MeHg demethylation rate constant values are within the range of those derived from Hg-spiked experiments. We also show that the post-depositional redistribution of total Hg during the early stages of sediment diagenesis is minor and that the solid-phase Hg-T record can be used to reconstruct the evolution of the anthropogenic Hg-T deposition.

Experiments were conducted at 1300 mg/L initial COD, 0-1.23 V vs SHE and 1.4-1.54 V vs SHE potential windows, 50 mA/cM2 current density, 0-25 mM NaCl, 60-80 degrees C temperature and acidic conditions. The reactivity of model compounds decreases in the order phenol approximate to p-coumaric acid > cinnamic acid > caffeic acid. Partial and total oxidation reactions occur with the overall rate following zero-order kinetics with respect to COD and increasing with temperature. Oxidation of OMW at 43 Ah/L, 80 degrees C and in the presence of 5 mM NaCl leads to complete color and phenols removal, elimination of ecotoxicity but moderate (30%) COD reduction. Similar performance can be achieved at 6 Ah/L in the presence of 15 mM NaCl. In the absence of salt, the respective color and phenols removal (at 6Ah/L) is less than 10%. Excessive salinity (25 mM), although does not change color, phenols and COD removal, has an adverse effect on ecotoxicity. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

J	Aller, Robert C.; Madrid, Vanessa; Chistoserdov, Andrei; Aller, Josephine Y.; Heilbrun, Christina					Aller, Josephine/0000-0003-1549-1108			Unsteady diagenetic processes and sulfur biogeochemistry in tropical deltaic muds: Implications for oceanic isotope cycles and the sedimentary record								GEOCHIMICA ET COSMOCHIMICA ACTA				74	16			4671	4692		10.1016/j.gca.2010.05.008				AUG 15 2010	2010	Sedimentary S cycling is usually conceptualized and interpreted within the context of steadily accreting (1-D) transport-reaction regimes. Unsteady processes, however, are common in many sedimentary systems and can result in dramatically different S reaction balances and diagenetic products than steady conditions. Globally important common examples include tropical deltaic topset and inner shelf muds such as those extending from the Amazon River similar to 1600 km along the Guianas coast of South America. These deposits are characterized by episodic reworking of the surface seabed over vertical depths of similar to 0.1-3 m. Reworked surface sediments act as unsteady, suboxic batch reactors, unconformably overlying relict anoxic, often methanic deposits, and have diagenetic properties largely decoupled from net accumulation of sediment. Despite well-oxygenated water and an abundant reactive organic matter supply, physical disturbance inhibits macrofauna, and benthic communities are dominated by microbial biomass across immense areas. In the surficial suboxic layer, molecular biological analyses, tracer experiments, sediment C/S/Fe compositions, and delta S-34, delta O-18 of pore water SO42- indicate close coupling of anaerobic C, S, and Fe cycles. delta O-18-SO42- can increase by 2-3 parts per thousand during anaerobic recycling without net change in delta S-34-SO42-, demonstrating SO42- reduction coupled to complete anaerobic reoxidation to SO42- and a delta O-18-SO42- reduction + reoxidation fractionation factor >= 12 parts per thousand (summed magnitudes). S reoxidation must be coupled to Fe-oxide reduction, contributing to high dissolved Fe2+ (similar to 1 mM) and Fe mobilization-export. The reworking of Amazon-Guianas shelf muds alone may isotopically alter delta O-18-SO42- equivalent in mass to >= 25% of the annual riverine delivery of SO42- to the global ocean. Unsteady conditions result in preservation of unusually heavy delta S-34 isotopic compositions of residual Cr reducible S, ranging from 0 parts per thousand to >30 parts per thousand in physically reworked deposits. In contrast, bioturbated fades adjacent to physically reworked regions accumulate isotopically light S (delta S-34 to -20 parts per thousand) in otherwise similar decomposition regimes. The isotopic patterns of both physically and biologically reworked regions can be simulated with simple diagenetic models. Heavy S isotopic signatures are largely a consequence of unsteady diffusion and progressive anaerobic burndown into underlying deposits, whereas isotopically depleted bioturbated deposits predominantly reflect biogenic diffusive scaling and isotopic distillation/diffusive pumping associated with reoxidation in burrow walls immediately adjacent to reduced zones. The S isotopic transition from unsteady physically controlled regions of the Amazon delta moving laterally into bioturbated facies mimics the transition of S isotopic patterns temporally in the geologic record during the rise of bioturbation. No special role for S disproportionation is required to explain these differences. The potential role of unsteady, suboxic diagenesis and dynamic reworking of sediments has been largely ignored in models of the evolution of surficial elemental cycling and interpretations of the geologic record.

Recently, it was reported that the physical and chemical properties of these hybrid nanomaterials vary depending on where the MNPs are deposited in the CNTs. This review will cover area-selective deposition types of MNP in the internal cavity of CNTs (I), on the external walls of CNTs (II), and at the ends of CNTs (III). Various methods have been developed for coupling these two nanomaterials in the three mentioned configurations, and this contribution presents a compilation of the most effective and their main characteristics. In this review, the characterization techniques that allow corroborating each method's selectivity are also mentioned, highlighting the most precise techniques. Finally, the areas in which these hybrid nanomaterials are being used are mentioned, as well as some applications in which the selective coupling of these could be important.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0022-2461	1573-4803		WOS:000737750100088

The Cu/CuO/Cu2O/ NPSSF shows marked photocatalytic activity in PEC of hydrogen production by water splitting and photocurrent response features under visible light irradiation. In addition, Pt nanoparticles modified on the heterojunction surface increases the carrier density, promotes electron/hole separation and demonstrates the lowest flat band potential for 0.38 V(SCE). The current density of the Cu/CuO/Cu2O heterojunction photocatalyst modified by Pt on the NPSSF is about two times that on ITO at the potential of -0.4 V(SCE). The narrowband gaps of Pt/Cu/CuO/Cu2O/NPSSF heterojunction are calculated and ensure its wide absorption band in the visible region. It is discussed that the photoelectrocatalytic mechanism of this newly developed photocatalyst by water splitting. The recovery photocatalyst of Pt/Cu/CuO/Cu2O/NPSSF could solve the expensive separation processes and recovery difficulties of powders and nanoparticles photocatalysts.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			2162-8769	2162-8777		WOS:000661497700001

The final products were characterized by X-ray diffraction and crystallite-sizes were estimated from line broadening. The specific surface areas of catalysts were measured using the multipoint BET method and compositions were determined by thermogravimetric analysis. Ruthenium sulfide loaded gas diffusion electrodes were fabricated by a spraying technique and their electrochemical. behavior studied. The electrochemical oxidation of hydrogen was investigated in a three electrode cell using a ruthenium sulfide loaded gas diffusion electrode as the working electrode with humidified hydrogen containing small amounts of carbon monoxide. Results on the activity and the effects of carbon monoxide with reference to a standard platinum electrode measured at the same conditions show that ruthenium sulfide has a lower activity for hydrogen oxidation but is not susceptible to CO poisoning.

The as-obtained heterojunction nanostructures were characterized by field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface area analysis, thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) technologies. Electrochemical measurements showed that as-prepared Co-BPDC/Co-BDC heterojunction nanostructures presented markedly enhanced OER electrocatalytic activity, compared with single Co-BPDC, Co-BDC, and/or their physical mixture. Also, the Co-BPDC/Co-BDC-3 heterojunction prepared after treatment for 3 h exhibited the strongest catalytic activity. To reach the current density j(geo) = 10 mA cm(-2), the Co-BPDC/Co-BDC-3 heterojunction-modified glassy carbon electrode required an overpotential of 335 mV in 1 M KOH, which was reduced by 57 and 93 mV, compared to the electrodes modified by Co-BDC and Co-BPDC, respectively. Simultaneously, the heterojunction catalyst also displayed better long-term stability. The improvement of the above performances should be attributed to the increased structure stability, BET surface area, ECSA, and electron transfer ability of the heterojunction.									64	1	0	0	6	0	64			0020-1669	1520-510X		WOS:000509420100040	31916752

TiO2 films were obtained by spin-coating platinum substrates with the precursor solution. Infrared reflection-absorption spectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy and X-ray diffractrometry showed that films prepared at 100 degreesC were amorphous, films dried at 400 and 600 degreesC were composed of anatase and those prepared at 800 degreesC were rutile. Independent of the drying temperature, field emission scanning electron microscopy of the electrode surface showed that films have a cracked morphology. Cyclic voltammetry carried out at different scan rates showed that in films dried from 100 to 600 degreesC, the mass transport occurs by a semi-infinite linear diffusion. For rutile, however, the cyclic voltammetry results were better fitted considering a linear peak current, I-p, dependence on scan rate, i.e., the mass transport can be characterized by a surface reaction where the diffusion occurs only on the electrode I film interface (thin layer diffusion). Films were also characterized by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. For an ac frequency equal to 10,000 Hz, the flatband potentials shifted toward more positive potentials as the drying temperature increased. The S800 sample showed lower donor densities (1.2 x 10(18) cm(-3) at 10,000 Hz) compared with the other samples. The electrochemical behavior of the films was discussed in the light of structural differences. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science B.V.

Ach (lichen) were investigated. The aim of this study was to understand the relationship between prompt PF, DF and MR when the oxygen evolving complex (OEC) is destroyed. The signals of PF, DF and MR were measured simultaneously in plants in vivo to probe heat-induced damages in the photosynthetic electron transfer. PF is characterised by a polyphasic fluorescence rise OJIPSMT and DF induction curve has several maxima (I-n) and numbered in sequence according to their appearance during illumination. In control condition (25 degrees C) leaves of pea plants yield a typical OJIP rise with a flat P-step (0.2-2 s) and in G. biloba and P. tiliacea thalli, the P-level was split into two peaks, the first peak P (0.2 s) is followed by a decrease of the fluorescence intensity to a dip (S) and a subsequent rise to a second peak (M). An antiparallel relation between J-I-P-S and DF curves was also observed. Methyl viologen (MV) reduced the amplitude of the I-P phase of the PF curve and this change was accompanied by a disappearance of the PSM transient. In the presence of MV, the DF intensity remained higher; and the I-4 peak disappeared. We suggested that P-S-M rise from PF and I-4 peak might be related to an acceleration of intersystem electron transport. After 50 degrees C incubation, significant changes appeared in the PF, DF and MR transients and that were dependent on the photosynthetic sample. Heat treatment provoked a down regulation of electrons donation by the OEC in the three plant species and the re-reduction of P700(+) and PC+ started earlier and began already after 10 ms of illumination. Inhibition of the donation of electrons by OEC after 50 degrees C incubation indicates that DF induction depends on the concentrations of Q(A)(-) and P680(+) and the proton gradient. 2016 Elsevier B.V.

J	Chen, Yingdong; Yang, Shujiao; Liu, Hongfei; Zhang, Wei; Cao, Rui								An unusual network of alpha-MnO2 nanowires with structure-induced hydrophilicity and conductivity for improved electrocatalysis								CHINESE JOURNAL OF CATALYSIS				42	10			1724	1731		10.1016/S1872-2067(21)63793-2				OCT 2021	2021	Nanowires with anisotropic morphologies have been applied in various scientific and technological areas. It is also widely employed to fabricate nanowires into high-dimensional superstructures (arrays, networks etc.) to overcome the shortcomings of low-dimensional nanowires. However, typical strategies for constructing these superstructures are restricted to complicated and harsh synthetic conditions, not to mention unique 3D structures with advanced properties beyond common superstructures. Herein, we report an unusual network of alpha-MnO2 nanowires with structure-induced hydrophilicity and conductivity. In the network, the nanowires are interconnected from all directions by nodes, and the 3D network structure is formed from the endless connection of nodes in a node-by-node way. The unique network structure brings about high hydrophilicity and conductivity, both of which are positive factors for an efficient electrocatalyst. Accordingly, the alpha-MnO2 network was tested for electrocatalytic water oxidation and showed significantly enhanced activity compared with isolated alpha-MnO2 nanowires and 3D alpha-MnO2 microspheres. This study not only provides a synthetic route toward an advanced network structure but also a new idea for the design of materials for electrochemistry with both efficient mass diffusion and charge transfer.

However, only a few catalysts meet the requirement so far, and developing such catalysts is a still great challenge. A transparent 2D hexagonally ordered mesoporous film (ca. 70-80 nm thickness) of intermediate IrOx(OH)(y) on fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) electrodes was developed to work efficiently for electrocatalytic water oxidation at pH 7.0. A homogeneous Irprecursor solution containing a polymeric surfactant, Pluronic F127, was spin-coated over a FTO electrode, and then the as-made film was calcined at 300 degrees C to give an adherent intermediate IrOx(OH)(y) film but containing charred organic/carbonaceous residues due to the incomplete combustion of Pluronic F127. A simple UV-ozone treatment strategy has been established to remove the organic/carbonaceous residues without hampering the intermediate IrOx(OH)(y) film. This strategy resolved the synthesis dilemma of previous approaches with calcination at >= 400 degrees C that resulted in a mesoporous structure but converted the intermediate IrOx(OH)(y) to a lesser active amorphous/crystalline IrOx in the film. A 11.2-fold higher specific surface area was attained by the 2D hexagonal mesoporous IrOx(OH)(y) film (125 m(2) g(-1)) compared to the nanoporous IrOx(OH)(y) film (4 m(2) g(-1)). The observed catalytic current (I-cat) of the mesoporous IrOx(OH)(y) electrode was 2.6-fold higher than that of the mesoporous IrOx electrode (calcined at 400 degrees C) due to the 2.8-fold higher intrinsic catalytic activity. I-cat of the mesoporous IrOx(OH)(y) electrode was 1.5-fold higher than that of the nanoparticle IrOx(OH)(y) electrode due to the 1.2-fold increased amount of the electroactive Ir sites and 1.2-fold higher intrinsic catalytic activity. Electrochemical impedance data revealed that charge transfer resistances (29.6-61.9 Omega) for bulk charge transport through the mesoporous IrOx(OH)(y) film were lower than those (42.3-169 Omega) through the mesoporous IrOx electrode, which are explained by the more efficient electron transport in the former film. The mesoporous IrOx(OH)(y) film provided a low overpotential (eta) of 0.24 V and Tafel slope of 39 mV dec(-1) for water oxidation at pH 7.0, which are comparable with those (eta = 0.20-0.25 V and Tafel slope of 40-50 mV dec(-1)) for hitherto-reported highly efficient IrOx electrocatalysts.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			2574-0962			WOS:000656119600012

It is of great value to explore the joining behavior of CrMnFeCoNi in order to expand its application fields. In this paper, we have fabricated the Au80Sn20/CrMnFeCoNi solder joint using vacuum soldering. The results indicate that Au80Sn20 eutectic alloy wets CrMnFeCoNi high entropy alloy well. Vickers hardness of the intermetallic compounds (IMCs) is about 300HV, higher than Au80Sn20 solder; the shear strength of solder joint reaches 67.52 MPa, 1.5-2 times stronger than that soldering with Kovar alloy and pure nickel. The distribution of novel nanoscale Co3Fe7 particles in the IMCs layer significantly enhances the shear strength of solder joint. The results motivate a multi-elements strategy to enhance mechanical performance of joints, thus showing great potential in industrial application. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

Inspired by the natural photosynthetic scheme, a photoelectrochemical cell (PEC) is constructed configured with protonated graphitic carbon nitride (p-g-C3N4) and carbon nanotube hybrid (CNT/p-g-C3N4) film cathode, and FeOOH-deposited bismuth vanadate (FeOOH/BiVO4) photoanode for the production of industrially useful chiral alkanes using an old yellow enzyme homologue from Thermus scotoductus (TsOYE). In the biocatalytic PEC platform, photoexcited electrons provided by the FeOOH/BiVO4 photoanode are transferred to the robust and self-standing CNT/p-g-C3N4 hybrid film that electrocatalytically reduces flavin mononucleotide (FMN) mediator. The p-g-C3N4 promotes a two-electron reduction of FMN coupled with an accelerated electron transfer by the conductive CNT network. The reduced FMN subsequently delivers the electrons to TsOYE for the highly enantioselective conversion of ketoisophorone to (R)-levodione. Under light illumination (>420 nm) and external bias, (R)-levodione is synthesized with the enantiomeric excess value of above 83%, not influenced by the scale of applied bias, simultaneously exhibiting stable and high current efficiency.

The catalysts were prepared by thermal decomposition of polymeric precursors and characterized by energy dispersive X-ray, scanning electronic microscopy, X-ray diffraction and cyclic voltammetry. This preparation method allowed obtaining uniform films with controlled stoichiometry and high surface area. Cyclic voltammetry experiments in the presence of methanol showed that mixed electrodes decreased the potential peak of methanol oxidation by approximately 100 mV (RHE) when compared to the electrode containing only Pt. In addition, voltammetric experiments indicated that the Pt0.6Ru0.4Oy electrode led to higher oxidation current densities at lower potentials. Chronoamperometry experiments confirmed the contribution of RuO2 to the catalytic activity as well as the better performance of the Pt0.6Ru0.4Oy electrode composition. Formic acid and CO2 were identified as being the reaction products formed in the electrolysis performed at 400 and 600 mV. The relative formation of CO2 was favored in the electrolysis performed at 400 mV (RHE) with the Pt0.6Ru0.4Oy electrode. The presence of RuO2 in Pt-Ru-based electrodes is important for improving the catalytic activity towards methanol electrooxidation. Moreover, the thermal decomposition of polymeric precursors seems to be a promising route for the production of catalysts applicable to DMFC. (C) 2009 International Association for Hydrogen Energy.

It is especially important to improve the performance and durability of electrocatalysts for the OER. Here we have shown that the transformation of nanoparticle (n-NNP) and crystalline (c-NNP) forms of mixed phosphate Na4Ni3(PO4)(2)P(2)O(7)in highly alkaline solutions occurs along various routes and provokes the generation of 2D Ni(OH)(2)nanosheets or stable core(phosphate)-shell(Ni(OH)(2)) particles, respectively. In both cases, in the carbon matrix (through chemical and electrochemical conversion of phosphatein situduring electrolysis in a 6 M KOH or NaOH solution) stable OER electrocatalysts with low overpotentials of 250-290 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2)were obtained. The best candidate for the OER process is core-shell particles, which maintain overpotentials of around 250 mV in 6 M KOH for more than 3 days. The activity enhancement can be attributed to the formation of abundant NiOOH nanoparticles on the shell surface due to improved lattice matching. This report discusses future prospects for the creation of core-shell particles to reduce the overpotential of durable electrocatalysts for the OER.									7	0	0	0	0	0	7			1477-9226	1477-9234		WOS:000544994400020	32501461

Complementary laser diagnostics of metastable N2(A3Sigmau+,nu) molecules in nonequilibrium plasmas and in high-speed flows								AIAA Scitech 2020 Forum								31 pp.	31 pp.						2020	2020	Non-intrusive laser diagnostics of metastable NN molecules in the lowest excited electronic state, A3Sigmau+ , are used for measurements of N2(A3Sigmau+,nu) vibrational level populations in ns pulse discharge plasmas in molecular gas mixtures and in a nonequilibrium supersonic flow. In high pressure -plasmas, at pressures of 100-400 Torr, time-resolved absolute N2(A3Sigmau+,nu=0,1) populations are measured by single-pass, continuous wave Tunable Diode Laser Absorption Spectroscopy (TDL-AS). In a supersonic flow, at a pressure of several Torr, absolute N2(A3Sigmau+,nu=0,1) populations are determined by Cavity Ring Down Spectroscopy (CRDS). TDLAS measurements are made in nitrogen, H2-N2, O2-N2, and NO-N2 mixtures excited by a double dielectric barrier, repetitively pulsed, ns discharge in a place-to-plane geometry, operated at a pulse repetition rate of 100 kHz. The results are compared with kinetic modeling predictions, identifying the dominant mechanisms of N2(A3Sigmau+,nu) generation and decay during the discharge pulses and in the afterglow. Temporal evolution of N2(A3Sigmau+,nu) populations during the discharge bursts in nitrogen provides an indirect measurement of time-resolved N atom number density, since collisional quenching by N atoms is the dominant process controlling N2(A3Sigmau+,nu) decay. CRDS measurements are made in nitrogen, in the test section of a nonequilibrium flow supersonic wind tunnel with the steady-state run time of approximately 10 seconds. The flow is excited by a 4 kHz repetitive ns pulse discharge in the wind tunnel plenum, at plenum pressures of P0=200-300 Torr, and expands through a two-dimensional contoured nozzle to the Mach number of M=3.6. The cavity ring down time is not affected by the supersonic flow. During each run, 50 single-shot ring down traces upsilone acquired, demonstrating good shot-to-shot reproducibility. N2(A3Sigmau+,nu=0, 1) populations and the flow temperature are inferred from the single-shot CRDS data. The two diagnostic techniques are complementary and can be used for characterization of both low-temperature plasmas and nonequilibrium reacting flows over a wide range of pressures, as well as at short run time high-enthalpy flow facilities.

The resulting POCN/anatase TiO2 demonstrated remarkable performance in the degradation of enrofloxacin (ENFX). The photocatalytic activity of this heterojunction was 28.9 and 3.71 times better than that of the CN and anatase TiO2, respectively. The microtopography of the POCN/anatase TiO2 was revealed in this study. Co-doping with P and O increased the visible light adsorption capacity of the g-C3N4, whereas the anatase TiO2 nanoparticles enhanced the adsorption properties of the ENFX and the separation of the photoinduced carriers of the POCN/anatase TiO2. The O-2(center dot-) and h(+) were the main reactive oxidative species in the photocatalytic degradation of ENFX. The results of the detection of H2O2 and ESR confirmed that POCN/anatase TiO2 was a type Z-scheme photocatalyst. Finally, the ENFX degradation pathways were estimated through the detection of by-products.									68	2	0	0	26	0	69			0304-3894	1873-3336		WOS:000514748600065	31740315

This study reports a design of magnetically Fe2O3 microboxes loaded on macroporous carbon (MPC) hybrids for high-performance electrocatalysts. The obtained Fe2O3 microboxes were converted by decomposition of Prussian blue microcubes (Fe-4(III)[Fe-II(CN)(6)](3)center dot nH(2)O) at a moderate temperature of 350 degrees C in air. MPC materials with excellent conductivity can offer a platform for the incorporation of Fe2O3 microboxes to form novel hybrid nanostructures with synergetic effects. Because of the unique structural properties and synergetic catalytic effect, a sensitive electrochemical sensor for nitrobenzene was developed based on Fe2O3/MPC, which showed a wide linear range, low detection limit, high sensitivity, and good stability.

The significant catalytic current for water oxidation was generated in a Na2B4O7 solution at pH 9.4 when applying 0.94 V versus Ag/AgC1 in contrast to no catalytic current generation in the K2SO4 solution at the same pH. HB4O7 and B4O72- ions were indicated to act as key cofactors for the induced catalytic activity of the CoO(OH) layer. The Na2B4O7 concentration dependence of the catalytic current was analyzed based on a Michaelis-Menten-type kinetics to provide an affinity constant of cofactors to the active sites, K-m = 28 +/- 3.6 mM, and the maximum catalytic current density, I-max = 2.3 +/- 0.13 mA cm(-2). The I-max value of HB4O7- and B4O72- ions was 1.4 times higher than that (1.3 mA cm(-2)) for the previously reported case of CO32- ions. This could be explained by the shorter-range proton transfer from the active site to the proton-accepting cofactor because of the larger size and more flexible conformation of HB4O7 and B(4)O(7)(2-)ions compared with that of CO32- ions.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000414115700050	28980797

Herein, a ligament size-controlled synthesis of open-shell NPG bowls (NPGB) through hetero-epitaxial growth of NPGB on AgCl is reported. The ligament size in NPGB is controlled from 6 to 46 nm by varying the hydroquinone to HAuCl4 ratio. The Williamson-Hall analysis demonstrates a higher lattice strain in smaller ligament size. In particular, NPGB with 6 nm (NPGB 6) ligament size possess the highest strain of 15.4 x 10(-3), which is nearly twice of conventional 2D NPG sheets (approximate to 8.8 x 10(-3)). The presence of high surface energy facets in NPGBs is also envisaged. The best electrocatalytic activity toward methanol oxidation is observed in NPGB 6 (27.8 mu A mu g(-1)), which is approximate to 9-fold and 3-fold higher than 8 nm solid Au nanoparticles, and conventional NPG sheets. The excellent catalytic activity in NPGB 6 is attributed to the open-shell structure, lattice strain, and higher electro-active surface area, allowing efficient exposure of catalytic active sites to facilitate the methanol oxidation. The results offer a potential strategy for designing next generation electrocatalysts.									27	1	0	0	2	0	27			1613-6810	1613-6829		WOS:000383377100011	27389580

Further electrochemical deposition of platinum particles on the oxide substrate enabled the formation of a stable composite with a specific capacitance of ca. 431 F cm(-3) that compares well with that available with similar materials obtained by non-electrochemical methods. Additional advantages of electrochemically obtained composites are the lower content of noble metal, the uniform distribution of the charge over an extended potential range, and, importantly, the simplicity of the preparation method. It was also found that when deposited on a Co3O4 substrate, Pt particles show, besides an enhanced active surface area, an improved catalytic activity for methanol anodic oxidation. This behavior was tentatively ascribed to the presence of a high amount of platinum-oxidized species.									11	0	0	0	0	0	11			1432-8488	1433-0768		WOS:000311509100028		
J	Wen, XG; Gong, HM; Lu, CM								Heat stress induces a reversible inhibition of electron transport at the acceptor side of photosystem II in a cyanobacterium Spirulina platensis								PLANT SCIENCE				168	6			1471	1476		10.1016/j.plantsci.2005.01.015				JUN 2005	2005	The effects of high temperature (30-52.5 degrees C) on electron transport at the acceptor side of photosystem 11 (PSII) in a cyanobacterium Spirulina platensis grown at 30 degrees C were studied by measuring the relaxation of flash-induced variable chlorophyll fluorescence. In order to investigate the reversibility of the effects of heat stress on electron transport at the acceptor side of PSII, heat-induced effects were measured either immediately after the cells were treated at high temperature for 5 min or after the heat-treated cells were cooled down to the growth temperature and incubated for another 5 min. The maximal efficiency of PSII photochemistry (F-v/F-m) decreased significantly with increasing temperature when measured immediately after the temperature treatment. F-v/F-m showed only a partial recovery (5-15%) when the heat-treated cells were cooled down to the growth temperature and incubated for another 5 min. The decrease in F-v/F-m was a result of a considerable increase in the minimal fluorescence yield and a significant decrease in the maximal fluorescence yield. Heat stress affected considerably the relaxation of flash-induced variable chlorophyll fluorescence. The amplitudes of the fast (approximate to 160 mu s) and the middle (approximate to 2 s) components, assigned to electron transfer from Q(A)(-) to Q(B) site and the diffusion of PQ molecules to an empty Q(B) site, respectively, decreased significantly with increasing temperature. On the other hand, the slow component ( 4 s) due to the charge recombination from the S(2)Q(A)(-) state of the water oxidation to the S(1)Q(A) state, increased significantly. These results suggest that heat stress leads to the inhibition of electron transport from Q(A)(-) to Q(B), the binding affinity of a PQ molecule to the Q(B)-binding site, and the increased probability of back electron transfer from Q(A)(-) to S-2 state at the expense of forward electron flow. However, these changes in the function of the acceptor side of PSII were mostly recovered after 5 min incubation at the growth temperature. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

In addition to a classic direct synthesis, postsynthesis modulations of MOFs, including ion exchange, installation, and destruction, can significantly expand the application. Because of a limitation of the qualitative hard and soft acids and bases (HSAB) theory, posttreatment permits regulation of MOF structure by cleaving chemical bonds at the molecular level. Here, methods of coordination bond scission to tailor the structure are critically appraised and the application to energy storage and conversion is assessed. MOF structures synthesized by molecular-level coordination bond cleavage are described and the corresponding MOFs for electrocatalysis and renewable battery applications are evaluated. Significant emphasis is placed on various coordination bond cleavage to tune properties, including chemical groups, electronic structures, and morphologies. The review concludes with a critical perspective on practical application, together with challenges and future outlook for this emerging field.									15	0	0	0	0	0	15			0935-9648	1521-4095		WOS:000703006600001	34605072

In this work, we report on the defect engineering of ZnCdS with surface disorder layer by simple room temperature Li-ethylenediamine (Li-EDA) treatment. Experimental results confirm the formation of unusual Zn and S dual vacancies, where rich S vacancies (V-S) served as electron trapping sites, meanwhile Zn vacancies (V-Zn) served as hole trapping sites. The refined structure significantly facilitates the photo charge carrier transfer and improves photocatalytic properties of ZnCdS. The disordered ZnCdS shows a highest photocatalytic H-2 production rate of 33.6 mmol.g(-1).h(-1) under visible light with superior photocatalytic stabilities, which is 7.3 times higher than pristine ZnCdS and 7 times of Pt (1 wt.%) loaded ZnCdS.									12	1	0	0	1	0	12			1998-0124	1998-0000		WOS:000669174800001

Here, RuO2 nanoparticles on fluorine-doped graphene (F-graphene) are synthesized with silicon nanowires serving as a sacrificial template. Small RuO2 nanoparticles are homogeneously distributed on the surface of graphene without aggregation due to the suitable reducibility of Si-H. The content of Ru in the RuO2/F-graphene electrocatalyst is only 6.9 wt%, but it can exhibit better HER or OER performance and stability than 20% Pt/C or commercial RuO2. The potentials @ 10 mA cm(-2) of RuO2/F-graphene for overall water splitting in 1 M KOH and 1 M PBS solution are only 1.56 and 1.73 V respectively, lower than those of commercial RuO2 (1.72 and 2.34 V). Furthermore, the addition of fluorine with strong electronegativity can enhance the electrical conductivity and stability of the RuO2/F-graphene electrocatalyst. The decreased noble metal content and increased stability of RuO2/F-graphene catalysts may have practical applications.									16	1	0	0	2	0	15			2052-1553			WOS:000539265900004

Herein, we report a novel strategy to fabricate ultrafine hematite (alpha-Fe2O3) nanowire arrays in a mixed water-ethanol-acetic acid (WEA) solvent. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report on direct growth of ultrafine (similar to 10 nm) alpha-Fe2O3 nanowire arrays on fluorine-doped tin oxide substrates through solution-based fabrication process. The effect of WEA ratio on the morphology of nanowires has been systematically studied to understand the formation mechanism. Photoelectrochemical measurements were conducted on both Ti-treated alpha-Fe2O3 nanowire and nanorod photoelectrodes. It reveals that alpha-Fe2O3 nanowire electrode has higher photocurrent and charge separation efficiencies than nanorod electrode if the carrier concentration and space-charge carrier width are in the same order of magnitude. Normalized by electrochemically active surface area, the Ti-treated alpha-Fe2O3 nanowire electrode obtains 6.4 times higher specific photocurrent density than nanorod electrode. This superiority of nanowires arises from the higher bulk and surface charge separation efficiencies, which could be partly attributed to reduced distance that holes must transfer to reach the semiconductor-liquid junction.									17	2	0	0	0	0	18			1944-8244			WOS:000430642100049	29577716

The pCN/C dots photoanode gives an increased anodic photocurrent of 38 mu A/cm(2) at 1V vs. RHE under illumination with simulated one sun conditions, which is about 3 times higher than that of the pristine pCN. The improved photoresponse of the pCN/C dots film was found as a result from enhanced light absorption and decreased charge transfer resistance with the incorporation of C dots. The successful deposition of pCN/C dots on flexible conductive PET substrate holds promising application in multiple electronic and photoelectronic devices.									14	2	0	0	1	0	14			2196-0216			WOS:000446066100005

Here, the de novo design of a Mott-Schottky-type heterogeneous catalyst is reported to boost the activity of a transition-metal nanocatalyst through electron transfer at the metal/nitrogen-doped carbon interface. The Mott-Schottky catalyst of nitrogen-rich carbon-coated cobalt nanoparticles (Co@NC) was prepared through direct polycondensation of simple organic molecules and inorganic metal salts in the presence of g-C3N4 powder. The Co@NC with controllable nitrogen content and thus tunable Fermi energy and catalytic activity exhibited a high turnover frequency (TOF) value (8.12 mol methyl benzoate mol(-1) Co h(-1)) for the direct, base-free, aerobic oxidation of benzyl alcohols to methyl benzoate; this TOF is 30-fold higher than those of the state-of-the-art transition metal-based nanocatalysts reported in the literature. The presented efficient Mott-Schottky catalyst can trigger the synthesis of a series of alkyl esters and even diesters in high yields.									266	17	0	0	23	0	271			0002-7863			WOS:000392459300040	28006898

It is demonstrated that iron-only electrode materials prove to be active for catalyzing both proton reduction and water oxidation in alkaline electrolyte solution with superior activity to that of previously established bi-functional catalysts containing less abundant elements. The reported bi-functionality of the iron electrodes is reversible upon switching of the applied bias through electrochemical interconversion of catalytic species at the electrode surface. Cycling of the applied bias results in in-situ electrochemical regeneration of the catalytic surfaces and thereby extends the catalyst stability and lifetime of the water electrolyzer. Full water splitting at a current density of I = 10 mA cm(-2) is achieved at a bias of approximate to 2 V, which is stable over at least 3 d (72 one hour switching cycles). Thus, potential-switching is established as a possible strategy of stabilizing electrode materials against degradation in symmetrical water splitting systems.									111	7	0	0	2	0	113			1614-6832	1614-6840		WOS:000373149700010

Calculation technique based on density functional theory was used. The results of two different calculation methods used to estimate work function agree very well mutually and with the experimentally obtained data, when available. In addition, the populations of valence orbitals as well as the energies of cl-band centres of surface Pt atoms were calculated, and compared with existing literature data. It was shown that one can tune surface electronic, and substantially, chemical properties by controlling the amount of solute elements in surface layer. Obtained results, in combination with previously established models, could be used as a starting point in a search for new catalysts and electrocatalysts. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

The precursor was formed on smooth nickel foam, and then the phosphorus source Na2H2PO4 was used to generate MoOx@Co2P4O12 at 300 degrees C. MoOx@Co2P4O12 has a three-dimensional lamellar structure. The as-prepared electrode materials have good performance in both HER and OER. In HER process, the as-obtained sample requires only an overpotential of 85.8 mV at 10 mA center dot cm(-2), and the as-obtained sample requires an overpotential of 290 mV at 15 mA center dot cm(-2) in OER. The assembled cell (1.61 V) can work stably at 15 mA center dot cm(-2). And the electrolytic cell voltage increased only 6 mV after 30 h. These results prove that MoOx@Co2P4O12 is a potential bifunctional catalysts. (c) 2021 The Electrochemical Society ("ECS").

J	Ye, Lin; Bao, Zepei; Zhao, Yuguang; Zhao, Lijun								Flowery nickel-cobalt hydroxide via a solid-liquid sulphur ion grafting route and its application in hybrid supercapacitive storage								RSC ADVANCES				8	42			23817	23824		10.1039/c8ra02791a				2018	2018	In our research, a two-step solid-liquid route was employed to fabricate flowery nickel-cobalt hydroxide with sulphur ion grafting (Ni1Co2-S). The utilization of NaOH/agar and Na2S/agar could efficiently retard the release rates of OH- or S2- ions at the solid-liquid interface due to strong bonding between agar hydrogel and these anions. Ni1Co2-S generally displays ultrathin flowery micro-frame, ultrathin internal nanosheets and expanded pore size. Besides, the introduction of suitable sulphide species into nickel-cobalt hydroxide could improve its conductivity due to the lower band gap of Ni-Co sulphide. The supercapacitive electrode Ni1Co2-S presented capacitance of 1317.8 F g(-1) (at 1 A g(-1)) and suitable rate performance (77.9% at 10 A g(-1) and 59.3% at 20 A g(-1)). Furthermore, a hybrid supercapacitor (HSC) was developed utilizing positive Ni1Co2-S and negative activated carbon electrodes. As expected, the HSC device exhibited excellent specific capacitance (117.1 F g(-1) at 1 A g(-1)), considerable energy densities (46.7 W h kg(-1) at 0.845 kW kg(-1) and 27.5 W h kg(-1) even at 9 kW kg(-1)) and suitable cycling performance, which further illuminated the high energy storage capacity of Ni1Co2-S.									9	0	0	0	1	0	9			2046-2069			WOS:000437475600037	35540268

This catalyst was synthesized by a straightforward method for the synthesis of an iron/nickel/zinc mixed oxide through the calcination of a Fe/Ni/Zn organometallic compound. The calcined product contains Fe and Ni as crucial ions for water oxidation, accompanied by the presence of Zn ions. The removal of Zn ions from the mixed oxide provides more active sites on the surface of the catalyst. The composition of the compound was characterized by some common methods and found to be an efficient water-oxidizing catalyst. The catalyst on FTO at pH = 13 yields a current density of 12 mA/cm(2) at 1.2V (vs. Ag vertical bar AgCl). After 5 hours at 1.1V, the electrode not only shows no decrease in performance, but also shows an increase from 4 to 7 mA/cm(2) in the water oxidation activity. Tafel plot, for the electrode at pH = 13 in KOH solution (0.1 M) showed linearity for the graph of Ig j vs. V with both relatively low (220.4 mV per decade) and high overpotentials (903.7 mV per decade).									5	0	0	0	1	0	5			2045-2322			WOS:000460392200002	30842566

The properties of graphene are highly dependent on its number of layers. Currently, the synthesis of uniform graphene with a specific number of layers in a controllable way is rather hard. In this review, we present the highlights of current advances regarding utilization of various plasmas for the control of graphene thickness. The mechanisms involved in the etching phenomenon of the graphene sheet to realize the layer control are particularly analyzed and compared. A precise layer-by-layer etching could be achieved using controlled operating parameters of different kinds of plasmas applied to graphene and combined with sub-layer substrate effects. With this review, we propose a concise overview of the application of plasma as the basis of development of new approaches to obtain uniform graphene with the desired number of layers in near future.

Serpentinized ultramafic clasts recovered from an active mud volcano in the Mariana forearc reveal microstructures, mineral assemblages and compositions that are indicative of a complex polyphase alteration history. Petrologic phase relations and oxygen isotopes suggest that ultramafic clasts were serpentinized at temperatures below 200 degrees C. Several successive serpentinization events represented by different vein generations with distinct trace element contents can be recognized. Measured in situ Rb/Cs ratios are fairly uniform ranging between 1 and 10, which is consistent with Cs mobilization from sediments at lower temperatures and lends further credence to the low-temperature conditions proposed in models of the thermal structure in forearc settings. Late veins show lower fluid mobile element (FME) concentrations than early veins, suggesting a decreasing influence of fluid discharge from the subducting slab on the composition of the serpentinizing fluids. The continuous microfabric and mineral chemical evolution observed in the ultramafic clasts may have implications as to the origin and nature of the serpentinizing fluids. We hypothesize that opal and smectite dehydration produce quartz-saturated fluids with high FME contents and Rb/Cs between 1 and 4 that cause the early pervasive serpentinization. The partially serpentinized material may then be eroded from the basal plane of the suprasubduction mantle wedge. Serpentinization continued but the interacting fluids did not carry a pronounced sedimentary signature, either because FMEs were no longer released from the slab, or due to an en route loss of FMEs. Late chrysotile veins that document the increased access of fluids in a now fluid-dominated regime are characterized by reduced trace element contents with a slightly increased Rb/Cs ratio near 10. This lack of sediment-dominated geochemical signatures consistently displayed in all late serpentinization stages may indicate that the sediment-derived fluids have been completely reset (i.e. the FME excesses were removed) by continued water-rock reaction within the subduction channel. The final stage of buoyant rise of matrix and clasts in the conduits is characterized by brucite-dominated alteration of the clasts from the clast rim inward (independent of the intra-clast fabric relations), which corresponds to re-equilibration with alkaline, low-silica activity fluids in the rising mud.

In this work, a simple two-step procedure based on the mixture of two suspensions containing the graphitic carbon nitride and antimonene flakes is used to produce heterostructures of different compositions, CNSbx. The materials have been characterized using spectroscopic, diffractometric, and microscopic techniques. The results confirm that carbon nitride (CN) and antimonene flakes are well-connected, forming a type I heterojunction. The CNSbx van der Waals heterostructures show improvements in the optical absorption as well as charge separation under illumination, as well as greater photoactivity in the degradation of organic pollutants to that showed for pristine CN. These results suggest potential applications in photoelectrochemical devices for heterostructures based on the combination of CNs with antimonene.									28	0	0	0	2	0	28			2366-7486			WOS:000458426200005

A developed plating bath was adopted to electrodeposit IrO2 on titanium substrates pretreated by three different pretreatment methods. The morphological characteristics, microstructure, electro-catalytic activities, and stability of electrodeposit IrO2 electrodes were observed and examined. In all cases, the hydrofluoric acid anodization improved the homogeneity and evenness of titanium substrates as well as the deposits. Among all samples, the electrodes with 1.0 wt% HF anodization exhibited the highest electro-catalytic activities and the ones with 0.5 wt% HF anodization exhibited the longest accelerate life time. The results indicate that anodization pretreatment in hydrofluoric acid has certain impacts on electrodeposited IrO2/Ti electrodes, although the effects depend on HF concentration. It might be suggested that a porous-structure was generated on titanium surface with hydrofluoric acid anodization, which may influence IrO2 electrodeposition, and thus the electro-catalytic activities and stability of such electrodes.

These structures were fabricated by attaching silver nanoparticles (NPs) onto TiO2 nanorods (NRs), synthesized using hydrothermal methodology, by electrodeposition as a time function. Field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), UV-vis analysis, and electrochemical techniques were used to characterize the synthesized materials. SEM analysis showed the formation of vertically oriented ca. 150-nm-diameter NRs, in turn constituted by 10-nm-diameter nanowires. On the other hand, the analysis of XRD indicated the formation of a TiO2 rutile phase. TEM images revealed ca. 5-nm-diameter silver nanoparticles attached to the TiO2 NR surface. The photoelectrochemical properties of the synthesized materials were evaluated in 0.1 M KOH using cyclic voltammetry, linear voltammetry, chronoamperometry, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) under dark and UV radiation at 365 nm. The photoelectrochemical oxidations of oxalic and formic acids were carried out under UV and visible irradiations on the material with the best photoeletrochemical performance. The obtained results demonstrated that the amount of silver increases both the light absorption and the faradic current during the oxygen evolution reaction as a result of an intrinsic-electric modification. During photoelectrochemical oxidation of the carboxylic acids, photocurrents of saturation were obtained, a condition suitable for photoelectrochemical cell (PEC) applications, representing 100% of photoexited electrons collected.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			1432-8488	1433-0768		WOS:000401736100029		
J	Li, Wenbo; Huang, Zhilong; Yin, Mudan								Isotope geochemistry of the Huize Zn-Pb ore field, Yunnan Province, Southwestern China: Implication for the sources of ore fluid and metals								GEOCHEMICAL JOURNAL				41	1			65	81		10.2343/geochemj.41.65				2007	2007	The Huize ore field, which is the most famous high-grade Zn-Pb ore field in China, comprises the Kuangshanchang and Qilinchang deposits. The Zn and Pb reserves of these two deposits are more than 5 Mt with ore grades ranging from 25% to 35% in weight. Lead, sulfur, carbon, oxygen, hydrogen and strontium isotope geochemistry is reported to help understand the sources of the ore fluid and metals. The Pb-206/Pb-204, Pb-207/Pb-204 and Pb-208/Pb-204 values of the ores range from 18.251-18.530, 15.663-15.855 and 38.487-39.433, respectively. These values are similar to those of the wall rocks. The pyrites disseminated in the wall rocks have indistinguishable Pb isotope composition with the ores. These data indicate that the wall rocks provided metals to the ore fluid. Most delta S-34 values of the ores range from 13 to 17 per mil. The sulfur of the ores originated by in situ reduction of sulfate. Three kinds of gangue calcite from the ores have similar isotope compositions, which have delta C-13 values in the range of -2.1 to -3.5 per mil with respect to PDB and delta(18)0 values in the range of 16.8 to 18.6 per mil with respect to SMOW. The delta D-Fl values of fluid inclusions in the three kinds of gangue calcites have a narrow range of -50 to -60 per mil and the delta O-18(H2O) values calculated from delta O-18 values of calcite range from 7.0 to 8.8 per mil at 200 degrees C. These data suggest that the ore fluid was a basinal brine that passed through shale, clastic rocks and mudstone underlying the host rock. Initial Sr-87/Sr-86 values of the pyrite, sphalerite and calcite from the ores range from 0.714 to 0.717. The initial Sr-87/Sr-86 values of unaltered host rock (0.7083-0.7093) are lower than that of the altered host rock (0.7106). It suggests that the ore fluids have higher initial Sr-87/Sr-86 values than the wall rocks. These high initial Sr-87/Sr-86 values may be due to the reaction between the ore fluid and the shale, clastic rocks and mudstone underlying the host rock or the fluid might have originated from these rocks.									18	11	0	0	0	0	26			0016-7002	1880-5973		WOS:000245512500006		
J	Thorne, WS; Hagemann, SG; Barley, M								Petrographic and geochemical evidence for hydrothermal evolution of the North Deposit, Mt Tom Price, Western Australia								MINERALIUM DEPOSITA				39	7			766	783		10.1007/s00126-004-0444-x				NOV 2004	2004	High-grade iron mineralisation (>65%Fe) in the North Deposit occurs as an E-W trending synclinal sheet within banded iron formation (BIF) of the Early Proterozoic Dales Gorge Member and consists of martite-microplaty hematite ore. Three hypogene alteration zones between unmineralised BIF and high-grade iron ore are observed: (1) distal magnetite-siderite-iron silicate, (2) intermediate hematite-ankerite-magnetite, and (3) proximal martite-microplaty hematite-apatite alteration zones. Fluid inclusions trapped in ankerite within ankerite-hematite veins in the hematite-ankerite-magnetite alteration zone revealed mostly H2O-CaCl2 pseudosecondary and secondary inclusions with salinities of 23.9 +/- 11.5 (1sigma, n = 38) and 24.4 +/- 11.5 (1sigma, n = 66) eq.wt.% CaCl2, respectively. Pseudosecondary inclusions homogenised at 253 +/- 59.9degreesC (1sigma, n = 34) and secondary inclusions at 117 +/- 10.0degreesC (1sigma, n = 66). The decrepitation of pseudosecondary inclusions above 350degreesC suggests that their trapping temperatures are likely to be higher (i.e. 400degreesC). Hypogene siderite and ankerite from magnetite-siderite-iron silicate and hematite-ankerite-magnetite alteration zones have similar oxygen isotope compositions, but increasingly enriched carbon isotopes from magnetite-siderite-iron silicate alteration (-8.8 +/- 0.7%, 1sigma, n = 17) to hematite-ankerite-magnetite alteration zones (-4.9 +/- 2.2%., 1sigma, n = 17) when compared to the dolomite in the Wittenoom Formation (0.9 +/- 0.7%, 1sigma, n = 15) that underlies the deposit. A two-stage hydrothermal-supergene model is proposed for the formation of the North Deposit. Early 1a hypogene alteration involved the upward movement of hydrothermal, CaCl2-rich brines (150-250degreesC), likely from the carbonate-rich Wittenoom Formation (delta(13)C signature of 0.9 +/- 10.7%, 1sigma, n = 15), within large-scale folds of the Dales Gorge Member. Fluid rock reactions transformed unmineralised BIF to magnetite siderite-iron silicate BIF, with subsequent desilicification of the chert bands. Stage 1b hypogene alteration is characterised by an increase in temperature (possibly to 400degreesC), depleted delta(13)C signature of -4.9 +/- 2.2% (1sigma, n = 17), and the formation of hematite-ankerite-magnetite alteration and finally the crystallisation of microplaty hematite. Late Stage 1c hypogene alteration involved the interaction of low temperature (similar to120degreesC) basinal brines with the hematite-ankerite-magnetite hydrothermal assemblage leaving a porous martite-microplaty hematite-apatite mineral assemblage. Stage 2 supergene enrichment in the Tertiary resulted in the removal of residual ankerite and apatite and the weathering of the shale bands to clay.									72	7	0	0	0	0	77			0026-4598	1432-1866		WOS:000225854400006

The pyrolysis and combustion methods have advantages when they are chosen to treat oil sludge. The investigation of kinetics is significantly important to know the kinetic parameters and the reaction mechanisms and to provide important theoretical basis for the process design of pyrolysis and combustion to treat oil sludge. Most previous studies on pyrolysis and combustion kinetics of oil sludge regarded pyrolysis process or combustion process, and rarely split pyrolysis or combustion process to calculate kinetic parameters separately. In this work, the experiment of pyrolysis and combustion were carried out by thermal gravimetric analyzer. After splitting the pyrolysis and combustion processes into two stages, respectively, the methods of Coats-Redfern and distributed activation energy model (DAEM) were used to calculate the kinetic parameters. Based on the results of thermogravimetric analysis, the pyrolysis and combustion process can be divided into two stages. For the pyrolysis process, the first stage is mainly with the evolution of adsorbed volatile hydrocarbon and the rupture of weaker chemical bond and the second stage is the cracking of organic macromolecules. Meanwhile, in the first stage of combustion process, small molecular organic matter in dry basis oil sludge will volatilize and then burn on the surface of the crucible and the gas phase outside the crucible, and in the second stage, macromolecular organic matter will volatilize, pyrolyze and burn, and the diffusion of oxygen into the crucible will cause the fixed carbon to burn. According to the kinetic results of the pyrolysis process, the activation energy of the first stage calculated by the Coats-Redfern model are all less than 40 kJ/mol, and that of the second stage increases from 148.14 kJ/mol to 184.97 kJ/mol with the increase of the heating rate. The results of DAEM model show that with the increase of the conversion rate, the activation energy of the first stage increases from 60.82 kJ/mol to 81.05 kJ/mol, and that of the second stage increases from 120.60 kJ/mol to 237.07 kJ/mol. For the combustion process, the activation energy calculated using Coats-Redfern model decreases from 120.18 kJ/mol to 73.48 kJ/mol in the first stage, and that of the second stage is relatively low. The results of DAEM model show that with the increase of the conversion rate, the activation energy decreases from 129.53 kJ/mol to 62.36 kJ/mol in the first stage and that in the second stage is stable at about 70 kJ/mol.									1	0	0	0	1	0	1			1556-7036	1556-7230		WOS:000605680100001

Neither of them, however, was found to be sufficiently active. In this work, we predict the properties of these two structurally similar pyrovanadates upon Cu/Mn substitution in their corresponding lattices via density functional theory calculations to explore the suitability of their band structure for water splitting and to assess their ease of synthesis. We predict that a concentration of up to 20% Cu and Mn into beta -Mn2V2O7 and beta -Cu2V2O7, respectively, leads to a narrowing of the bandgap, which, in the former case, is experimentally confirmed by UV-vis spectroscopy. Calculations in the intermediate composition range, however, yield nearly constant bandgaps. Moreover, we predict the materials with higher substitution levels to be increasingly difficult to synthesize, implying that low substitution levels are most relevant in terms of bandgaps and ease of synthesis.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			0021-9606	1089-7690		WOS:000565707100001	32872886

However, the practical application of BP as an efficient photocatalyst is greatly limited by its indirect band gap. In this work, we investigate the synergistic effect of substitutional doping and biaxial strain on the electronic and photocatalytic properties of BP using hybrid density functional calculations. The results show that As/Sb doping not only reduces the band gap of BP without introducing any midgap states but also turns it into direct band gap semiconductor, which can be ascribed to the p states of the dopants appearing around the band edges. For these As/Sb-doped BP systems, the band gaps, band edge positions, and optical absorption abilities can be further tuned by applying a biaxial strain. In particular, we predict that compressive strains are more propitious for the doped systems than the tensile strains since the requirements for water splitting are satisfied, meanwhile preserving the direct band gap characteristics. Besides, our calculations also show that the band gap and the reducing and oxidizing power of multilayer BP are highly dependent on the layer thickness. These results suggest feasible modulation strategies for enabling BP to be a visible-light-driven photocatalyst for water splitting.									11	1	0	0	0	0	11			0020-7608	1097-461X		WOS:000522346700001

The Reynolds numbers of the jets are assumed to be large, so that mixing of the two streams is restricted to a thin mixing layer that separates the counterflowing streams. The evolution of the droplets in their feed stream from the injection location is seen to depend fundamentally on the value of the droplet Stokes number, St, defined as the ratio of the droplet acceleration time to the mixing-layer strain time close to the stagnation point. Two different regimes of spray vaporization and combustion can be identified depending on the value of St. For values of St below a critical value, equal to 1/4 for dilute sprays with small values of the spray liquid mass-loading ratio, the droplets decelerate to approach the gas stagnation plane with a vanishing axial velocity. In this case, the droplets located initially near the axis reach the mixing layer, where they can vaporize due to the heat received from the hot air, producing fuel vapor that can burn with the oxygen in a diffusion flame located on the air side of the mixing layer. The character of the spray combustion is different for values of St of order unity, because the droplets cross the stagnation plane and move into the opposing air stream, reaching distances that are much larger than the mixing-layer thickness before they turn around. The vaporization of these crossing droplets, and also the combustion of the fuel vapor generated by them, occur in the hot air stream, without significant effects of molecular diffusion, generating a vaporization-assisted nonpremixed flame that stands on the air side outside the mixing layer. Separate formulations will be given below for these two regimes of combustion, with attention restricted to the near-stagnation-point region, where the solution is self-similar and all variables are only dependent on the distance to the stagnation plane. The resulting formulations display a reduced number of controlling parameters that effectively embody dependences of the structure of the spray flame on spray dilution, droplet inertia, and fuel preferential diffusion. Sample solutions are given for the limiting cases of pure vaporization and of infinitely fast chemistry, with the latter limit formulated in terms of chemistry-free coupling functions that allow for general nonunity Lewis numbers of the fuel vapor.									12	0	0	0	0	0	12			0010-2202	1563-521X		WOS:000346263500007

Concurrently, coastal seawater nutrient and organic matter composition change seasonally due to variations in pelagic productivity. To assess seasonal changes in organic matter degradation in the intertidal zone of a high energy beach (Spiekeroog Island, southern North Sea, Germany), we analyzed shallow pore waters for major redox constituents (oxygen [O-2], manganese [Mn], and iron [Fe]) and inorganic nitrogen species (nitrite [NO2-], nitrate [NO3-], and ammonium [NH4+]) in March, August, and October. Surface water samples from a local time series station were used to monitor seasonal changes in pelagic productivity. O-2 and NO3- were the dominating pore water constituents in March and October. Dissolved Mn, Fe, and NH4+ were more widely distributed in August. Seasonal changes in seawater temperature as well as organic matter and nitrate supply by seawater were assumed to affect microbial rates and degradation pathways. Pore water and seawater variability led to seasonally changing constituent effluxes to surface waters. Mn, Fe, and NH4+ effluxes are minimal in March and reached their maximum in August. Furthermore, the intertidal sands switched from a net dissolved inorganic nitrogen sink in March to a net source in August. In conclusion, seasonal effects on intertidal pore water biogeochemistry affect constituent fluxes across the sediment-water interface. The seasonality of the beach bioreactor must be considered when fluxes are extrapolated to annual timescales.Plain Language Summary Beach sands are biologically active environments. Seawater is circulated through the sandy beach (e.g., via waves or tides) as are nutrients and algal remains - organic matter. Subsurface microbes start to break down organic matter and change the pore water chemistry before it is reintroduced into the ocean. This so called bioreactor is affected by seasonal changes in temperature and algal activity controlling seawater nutrient and organic matter content. This affects the rates of organic matter break down. Microbes are adapted to break down organic matter using various pathways and energy sources. The seasonality determines how fast microbes exhaust their energy source, for example, oxygen. The respective reaction pathways influence the release of pore water nutrients and trace metals. For example, beach sands of Spiekeroog are a sink for nitrogen in winter and early spring and retain nitrate from North Sea waters. In contrast, the beach is a nitrogen source to ocean water in summer: Nitrogen from algal biomass is recycled by microbes and resupplied to the coastal ocean. This is crucial, because during summer, nitrogen is a limiting factor for algal growth. Especially when coastal nutrient and metal budgets are being calculated, seasonal dynamics need to be considered.Key PointsSeasonal changes in temperature and seawater composition affect the succession of organic matter degradation within intertidal beach sands Aerobic and nitrate reducing conditions dominate pore waters in cold seasons, but Mn and Fe reduction are more important in warm seasons Intertidal sands change from dissolved inorganic nitrogen sink to source from cold to warm seasons but release Mn and Fe all the year									13	0	0	0	8	0	13			2169-8953	2169-8961		WOS:000534472900019

As one of the most practical and promising cathode materials for LIBs, Ni-rich layered oxide cathodes possess high capacity together with low cost. Nevertheless, due to its high sensitivity toward exposure to ambient air, structural evolution will occur accompanied with the generation of an impurity layer on the surface of the cathode. The structural instability of such Ni-rich cathodes in the storage process inevitably deteriorates their performance in subsequent service occasions. Herein, we carefully investigated the degradation mechanism of the Ni-rich cathode (LiNi0.8Co0.15Al0.05O2, NCA) after storage in the ambient air by means of in situ and ex situ characterization. The formed impurity layer on the surface of NCA has been determined as "residual lithium" composed of lithium carbonate and lithium bicarbonate, and nickel carbonate species due to the H+/Li+ exchange reaction followed by carbonation. Moreover, lithium and nickel extracted from the lattice to the surface further aggravated the formation of surface impurities, leaving a Li deficiency layer accompanied with spinel and rock salt phases near the surface. Simultaneously, the degraded NCA possessed increased c-axis and decreased a-axis lattice parameters, a lower degree of Ni/Li anti-sites and more surface Ni2+ ions, which caused the deterioration of its electrochemical performances. In addition, we proposed a facile method for regenerating the degraded NCA after ambient storage. By mixing the degraded NCA with a certain amount of additional lithium source and calcining the mixture in an oxygen atmosphere at a given temperature for a certain time, the degraded NCA was restored to its original state and regained superior electrochemical performances. It is highly expected that this work may help deepen the understanding of the storage failure and regeneration for Ni-rich cathode materials, and promote the practical industrialization and application of LIBs.									22	0	0	0	0	0	22			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000621407000017

Herein, the hollow CoS nanocages deriven from ZIF-67 have been reported for the first time to combine with CeO(2)NPs grown in situ for photocatalytic degradation of stubborn pollutants. The unique CoS nanocages not only provide rich active sites but also enhance light capture. CeO(2)NPs loaded on the surface accelerate the separation of photocharges and extend the lifetime of photogenerated carriers. The optimized photocatalysts show outstanding activity and stability for the photodegradation of tetracycline and phenol under visible light, and the corresponding photodegradation efficiency is 96.5% and 90.5% at 60 minutes. The novel multi-stage nanocage structure simultaneously realizes extended light absorption and improved photocharges transfer efficiency.

The development of fuel cells has significantly progressed over the past decades. Specifically, polymer electrolyte fuel cells, which are representative of proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs), exhibit high efficiency, high power density, and quick start-up times. However, the high cost of PEMFCs, partially from the Pt-based catalysts they employ, hinders their diverse applicability. Hydroxide exchange membrane fuel cells (HEMFCs), which are also known as alkaline polymer electrolyte fuel cells (APEFCs), alkaline anion-exchange membrane fuel cells (AAEMFCs), anion exchange membrane fuel cells (AEMFCs), or alkaline membrane fuel cells (AMFCs), have attracted much attention because of their capability to use non-Pt electrocatalysts and inexpensive bipolar plates. The HEMFCs are structurally similar to PEMFCs but they use a polymer electrolyte that conducts hydroxide ions, thus providing an alkaline environment. However, the relatively sluggish kinetics of the hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR) inhibit the practical application of HEMFCs. The anode catalyst loading needed for HEMFCs to achieve high cell performance is larger than that required for other fuel cells, which substantially increases the cost of HEMFCs. Therefore, low-cost, highly active, and stable HOR catalysts in the alkaline condition are greatly desired. Here, we review the recent achievements in developing such HOR catalysts. First, plausible HOR mechanisms are explored and HOR activity descriptors are summarized. The HOR processes are mainly controlled by the binding energy between hydrogen and the catalysts, but they may also be influenced by OH adsorption, interfacial water adsorption, and the potential of zero (free) charge. Next, experimental methods used to elevate HOR activities are introduced, followed by HOR catalysts reported in the literature, including Pt-, Ir-, Pd-, Ru-, and Ni-based catalysts, among others. HEMFC performances when employing various anode catalysts are then summarized, where HOR catalysts with platinum-group metals exhibited the highest HEMFC performance. Although the Ni-based HOR catalyst activity was higher than those of other non-precious metal-based catalysts, they showed unsatisfactory performance in HEMFCs. We further analyzed HEMFC performances while considering anode catalyst cost, where we found that this cost can be reduced by using recently developed, non-Pt HOR catalysts, especially Ru-based catalysts. In fact, an HEMFC using a Ru- based HOR catalyst showed an anode catalyst cost-based performance similar to that of PEMFCs, making the HEMFC promising for use in practical applications. Finally, we proposed routes for developing future HOR catalysts for HEMFCs.									7	1	0	0	0	0	7			1000-6818			WOS:000614110200004

Herein, we demonstrate that a unique N-doped graphitic carbon-encapsulated iron nanoparticles can be utilized as a promising NRR electrocatalyst. The resulting Fe(20%)@N-C achieves a better nitrate removal proportion of 83.0% (attained in the first running cycle) compared to the efficiencies of other reference catalysts, including those with lower entrapped Fe content. The nitrogen selectivity is 25.0% in the absence of Cl- and increases to 100% when supplemented with 1.0 g L-1 NaCl. More importantly, there is no statistically significant difference (at a 95% confidence interval) regarding the removal percentage recorded over 20 cycles for the Fe(20%) @N-C cathode. We propose that the iron nanoparticles could attenuate the work function on the neighboring carbon atoms, which are the reactive sites for NRR, and that the graphitic shells hinder the access of the electrolyte, thus protecting the iron particles from dissolution and oxidation. Testing with the real industrial wastewater further demonstrates the superiority of Fe(20%)@N-C cathode towards NRR, as evidenced by efficient removal of nitrate available in the biological effluent from a local coking wastewater treatment plant.

The main phase of all BNTG ceramics demonstrated an orthorhombic tungsten-bronze structure, but the impurity phase (gallium-rich phase) was found in BNTG (y = 2) ceramic. Partial substitution of Ga3+ for Ti4+ in B-site was a valid method to improve the temperature stability and dielectric loss of BNTG ceramics. The variation of epsilon(r) values of BNTG ceramics was dominated by the ionic polarizability. The ultra-low dielectric loss (ultra-high Q x f values) was associated with grain size, suppression of Ti3+ and impurity phase. The decrease of TCF values was highly dependent on the tilting of Ti-O octahedra and impurity phase. Finally, outstanding combination dielectric characteristics were achieved for BNTG microwave ceramics at y = 1.5 (epsilon(r) = 72.8, Q x f = 14,600 GHz, TCF=+4.1 ppm/degrees C) and at y = 2 (epsilon(r) = 70.3, Q x f = 15,500 GHz, TCF=+3.9 ppm/degrees C).									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			0955-2219	1873-619X		WOS:000711382400004

However, Ti-based LDHs are rarely reported because of the difficulties of the preparation process, in which the Ti precursors are more prone to hydrolysis into titanium hydroxide. In this work, toward robust, efficient, and earth-abundant electrocatalysts for water oxidation in alkaline environments, we have engineered Ti-doped Ni(OH)(2) nanosheet arrays on carbon cloth [Ti-Ni(OH)(2)/CC] with a facile solvothermal and surfactant-free method. The experimental tests show that the activity of Ti-Ni(OH)(2)-1/CC (similar to 12.5 atom % Ti substitution) is optimal among these materials. In addition, the activity is correlated with the Ti substitution ratio and reversed with higher Ti doping level (>= 25 atom % Ti substitution). Therein, eta(10) of Ti-Ni(OH)(2)-1/CC is as low as 196 mV, and it is still maintained at 210 mV after a long-term chronopotentiometry (CP) test at a constant current density of 10 mA cm(-2). for 32 h, demonstrating superior activity and long-term durability. Density functional theory calculations further reveal that dilute Ti substitution produces extra active sites and promotes more optimal OH* adsorption to the surface of the electrocatalyst.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			0020-1669	1520-510X		WOS:000552287100079	32603102

Co3O4 nanocubes and Co3O4 nanospheres show regular geometry structure with diameters of 250 nm and 300 nm, respectively. Gas sensors based on different Co3O4 nanostructured are fabricated and used for investigating acetone sensing performances. The response of Co3O4 nanocubes based sensor to 500 ppm acetone is 4.88 at 240 degrees C, which is higher than that of Co3O(4) nanospheres. In addition, sensors based on Co3O4 nanocubes not only exhibit a high response but also have a rapid response time (2 s) and recovery process (5 s) to acetone. The enhanced sensing performances to acetone can be attributed to the effective catalytic activity of Co2+ at special low-index crystal facets. This finding demonstrates the shape-related synthesis of nanomaterials can be an effective way of designing high performance gas sensor, and also provides a new insight into gas-sensing mechanism.

J	Yang, Huimin; Chen, Yao; Qin, Yong								Application of atomic layer deposition in fabricating high-efficiency electrocatalysts								CHINESE JOURNAL OF CATALYSIS				41	2			227	241		10.1016/S1872-2067(19)63440-6				FEB 2020	2020	Electrocatalysis is a promising approach to clean energy conversion due to its high efficiency and low environmental pollution. Noble metal materials have been studied to show high activity toward electrocatalyltic reactions, although such applications remain restricted by the high cost and poor durability of the noble metals. By precisely adjusting the catalyst composition, size, and structure, electrocatalysts with excellent performance can be obtained. Atomic layer deposition (ALD) is a technique used to produce ultrathin films and ultrafine nanoparticles at the atomic level. It possesses unique advantages for the controllable design and synthesis of electrocatalysts. Furthermore, the homogenous composition and structure of the electrocatalysts prepared by ALD favor the exploration of structure-reactivity relationships and catalytic mechanisms. In this review, the mechanism, characteristics, and advantages of ALD in fabricating nanostructures are introduced first. Subsequently, the problems associated with existing electrocatalysts and a series of recently developed ALD strategies to enhance the activity and durability of electrocatalysts are presented. For example, the deposition of ultrafine Pt nanoparticles to increase the utilization and activity of Pt, fabrication of core-shell, overcoat, nanotrap, and other novel structures to protect the noble-metal nanoparticles and enhance the catalyst stability. In addition, ALD developments in synthesizing non-noble metallic electrocatalysts are summarized and discussed. Finally, based on the current studies, an outlook for the ALD application in the design and synthesis of electrocatalysts is presented.

The addition of copper or ruthenium as co-catalysts, modifies the electronic properties of platinum, demonstrating better performance in ethanol and CO electro-oxidation reactions. Ni59Nb40Pt0.6Cu0.4 alloy provides higher current densities towards ethanol electro-oxidation than Ni59Nb40Pt0.6Ru0.4 alloy but the possible formation of copper oxides limits its performance. The voltammograms for CO stripping clearly show that alloy with ruthenium possesses a better CO tolerance, decreasing the onset potential 109 mV with regard to Ni59Nb40Pt0.6Ru0.4 alloy. The presence of ruthenium is able to provide oxygenated adsorbed species coming from the cleavage of the water molecule, according to Langmmuir-Hinshelwood mechanism that it allows the CO oxidation to CO2. The homolytic cleavage C C bond is critical step in the ethanol electro-oxidation to CO2. The formation of acetic acid (AA) as final product is known, limiting the electric efficiency in Direct Ethanol Fuel Cells (DEFCs). The oxidation process was investigated by in situ Fourier Transformed Infrared Reflectance (FTIR) spectroscopy. The experimental results showed that both amorphous alloys can oxidize AA to CO2.

Exploration of high-efficiency photocatalysts paves the way for realizing ammonia synthesis under ambient conditions. In this study, through the molten salt method retreatment approach, we design a cyano group modified g-C3N4 (CG-CN), which enables high-efficiency visible-light-driven nitrogen fixation in the absence of any organic scavengers and precious-metal cocatalysts. The cyano group (-C N) can promote the separation of photogenerated electron-hole pairs and simultaneously induce the nitrogen activation based on the strong electron-withdrawing character. The introduction of the cyano group results in a 12.8 times improved photocatalytic nitrogen fixation activity in sharp contrast to that of pristine g-C3N4 (CN). This work provides a feasible route to modify photocatalysts with functional surface group for nitrogen fixation.									40	2	0	0	2	0	40			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000525637300025

Its low stability is counterbalanced by good activity, provided that a suitable underlayer/support is used. While Cu2O is mostly studied on Au underlayers, this paper proposes Cu(0) as a low-cost, easy to prepare and highly efficient alternative. Cu and Cu2O can be electrodeposited from the same bath, thus allowing in principle to tune the final material's physico-chemical properties with high precision with a scalable method. Electrodes and photoelectrodes are studied by means of electrochemical methods (cyclic voltammetry, Pb underpotential deposition) and by ex-situ X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS). While the potential applied for the deposition of Cu has no influence on the bulk structure and on the photocurrent displayed by the semiconductor, it plays a role on the dark currents, making this strategy promising for improving the material's stability. Au/Cu2O and Cu/Cu2O show similar performances, the latter having clear advantages in view of future use in practical applications. The influence of Cu underlayer thickness was also evaluated in terms of obtained photocurrent.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			1432-8488	1433-0768		WOS:000498282500001

The latter uses reduced FAD to activate oxygen and to oxygenate the substrate while releasing water. We circumvented the need for the reductase by direct FAD reduction in solution using the NAD(P)H-mimic 1-benzyl-1,4-dihydronicotinamide (BNAH) to fuel monooxygenases without NADH requirement. Herein, we report on the hitherto unknown solvent tolerance for the indole monooxygenase from Gemmobacter nectariphilus DSM15620 (GnIndA) and the styrene monooxygenase from Gordonia rubripertincta CWB2 (GrStyA). These enzymes were shown to convert bulky and rather hydrophobic styrene derivatives in the presence of organic cosolvents. Subsequently, BNAH-driven biotransformation was furthermore optimized with regard to the applied cosolvent and its concentration as well as FAD and BNAH concentration. We herein demonstrate that GnIndA and GrStyA enable selective epoxidations of allylic double bonds (up to 217 mU mg(-1)) in the presence of organic solvents such as tetrahydrofuran, acetonitrile, or several alcohols. Notably, GnIndA was found to resist methanol concentrations up to 25 vol.%. Furthermore, a diverse substrate preference was determined for both enzymes, making their distinct use very interesting. In general, our results seem representative for many IMOs as was corroborated by in silico mutagenetic studies.									2	0	0	0	1	0	2				2073-4344		WOS:000546007000116		
J	Fan, XiuZhi; Zhou, Yan; Xiao, Yang; Xu, ZhangYi; Bian, YinBing								Cloning, expression and phylogenetic analysis of a divergent laccase multigene family in Auricularia auricula-judae								MICROBIOLOGICAL RESEARCH				169	5-6			453	462		10.1016/j.micres.2013.08.004				2014	2014	Laccases (p-diphenol: oxygen oxidoreductase; EC 1.10.3.2) are multi-copper oxidases encoded by gene family in white rot fungi. Auricularia auricula-judae is one kind of white rot fungi with a soft, jelly-like texture and an ear-like shape. In the present study, seven laccase genes containing the signature sequences L1-L4 were isolated from A. auricula-judae strain Au916 on the basis of the mycelium-derived transcriptome. In the basidiomycetes, the predicted substrate binding loops of the A. auricula-judae laccases were found to be uncommon. Phylogenetic analysis showed that the laccases of the Auricularia were nested into the ascomycete laccases, indicating that the laccase genes from Auricularia are distinctly different in function from other basidiomycetes. Among the seven laccases, the intron positions and cluster distributions in the NJ tree varied from each other and the expression patterns of seven genes estimated by qRT-PCR were also discrepant. The lcc3 gene was highly expressed not only in the free-living mycelium but also in substrate mycelium, furthermore, the lcc5 gene was mostly expressed during the fruiting body formation and maturation indicating that lcc5 might play a major role during the sexual reproduction stage.

Although aerobic conditions can increase carotenoid production and crtNM expression levels, their effects on the pathways that synthesize carotenoid precursors such as mevalonate and isoprene are not completely understood. In this study, we investigated whether aerobic conditions affected gene expression levels involved in the isoprenoid biosynthesis pathway that includes the mevalonate and isoprene biosynthesis pathways in Enterococcus gilvus using real-time quantitative reverse transcription PCR. NADH oxidase (nox) and superoxide dismutase (sod) gene expression levels were investigated as controls for aerobic conditions. The expression levels of nox and sod under aerobic conditions were 7.2- and 8.0-fold higher, respectively, than those under anaerobic conditions. Aerobic conditions concomitantly increased the expression levels of crtNM carotenoid biosynthesis genes. HMG-CoA synthase gene expression levels in the mevalonate pathway were only slightly increased under aerobic conditions, whereas the expression levels of HMG-CoA reductase and five other genes in the isoprene biosynthesis pathways were 1.2-2.3-fold higher than those under anaerobic conditions. These results demonstrated that aerobic conditions could increase the expression levels of genes involved in the isoprenoid biosynthesis pathway via mevalonate in E. gilvus.									7	1	0	0	4	0	7			0378-1097	1574-6968		WOS:000356892200001	25962871

Studies enlightened that the C2H2 zinc finger proteins (C2H2-ZFP) were involved in regulating the stress response in plants. However, knowledge of the C2H2-ZFP subfamily C1 (ZAT; Zinc finger of Arabidopsis thaliana) in cotton is still a mystery. In this study, 47, 45, 94, and 88 ZAT genes were obtained from diploid A2, D5 and tetraploid AD1, AD2 cotton genomes, respectively. The function of hybridization and allopolyploidy in the evolutionary linkage of allotetraploid cotton was explained by the family of ZAT gene in 4 species. Duplication of gene activities indicates that the family of ZAT gene of cotton evolution was under strong purifying selection. The integration of previous transcriptome data related to NaCl stress, strongly suggests the GhZAT34 and GhZAT79 may interact with salt resistance in upland cotton. The expression level of certain ZAT genes, higher seed germination rate of transgenic Arabidopsis and gene- silenced cotton revealed that both genes were involved in the salt tolerance of upland cotton. This study may pave the substantial understandings into the role of ZATs genes in plants as well as suggest appropriate candidate genes for breeding of cotton varieties against salinity tolerance.									7	0	0	0	2	1	7			0141-8130	1879-0003		WOS:000682782900012	34197850

The data encompass single-pointed observations of the J = 1 --> 0 and J = 2 --> 1 rotational transitions for (CO)-O-18, (CO)-O-17, (CO)-C-13-O-17, and the J = 1 --> 0 transition for (CO)-C-13-O-18. Emission is detected for all isotopes and transitions observed. For the two O-17-containing species, the interstellar spectra display a partially resolved hyperfine spectrum due to the I = 5/2 spin of the O-17 nucleus. The isotope abundance ratios derived from these measurements are [C-12]/[C-13] = 65.0 +/- 6.3( stat) +/-9.2(syst) and [O-18]/[O-17] = 4.15 +/- 0.52(stat) +/- 0.59( syst), consistent with recent measurements for nearby molecular clouds. Thus, our measurements support the idea that both ratios are smaller in the local interstellar medium (ISM) than their terrestrial values of 89 and 5.5.									46	1	0	0	0	0	46			0004-637X	1538-4357		WOS:000172572700018

It was found that the decoration of Cu nanoclusters on BTN surfaces can improve the activity and selectivity of CO2 photoreduction to CH4, and 1.5% Cu-BTN gives a maximum overall photocatalytic activity (150.9 mu mol g(-1)h(-1)) for CO/CH4 production, which is approximate to 11.4 and approximate to 3.3 times higher than those of pristine BTN (13.2 mu mol g(-1) h(-1)) and Ag-BTN (45.2 mu mol g(-1) h(-1)). Moreover, the resultant Cu-BTN products can promote the selective generation of CH4 as compared to CO due to the number of surface oxygen vacancies and the CO2/H2O adsorption behavior, which differs from that of the pristine BTN. The present results demonstrate that brookite TiO2 would be a potential effective photocatalyst for CO2 photoreduction, and that Cu nanoclusters can act as an inexpensive and efficient co-catalyst alternative to the commonly used noble metals to improve the photoactivity and selectivity for CO2 reduction to CH4.									20	1	0	0	1	0	21			1439-4235	1439-7641		WOS:000417303900015	28719067

Separation of water splitting products is essential for this and approached by creating membrane photocatalytic system (MPS) without macroscopic metallic electrodes. The MPS has a layered structure Pt/chemically loaded TiO2/filtration loaded TiO2/porous polymer membrane/support. Influence of MPS preparation conditions on its TiO2 content, permeability, diffuse reflectance spectra, mechanical stability, Pt loading and membrane morphology was investigated. Chemical bath deposition of TiO2 followed by aging was found to be essential for mechanical stability and high activity in hydrogen production. Loading TiO2 by filtration alone is ineffective for achieving low permeability. The detected products of ethanol dehydrogenation in gas phase were H-2, CO2, CH4 and C2H6 and in liquid phase CH3COOH and CH3CHO. Optimum mass of TiO2 and photodeposited Pt were found for high rate of H-2 generation. The highest quantum efficiency of H-2 production was 13%. Copyright (c) 2012, Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC.

However, the impact of mitochondrial genetic variant on phenotypic variation has been poorly considered in microorganisms because mtDNA encodes very few genes compared to nuclear DNA, and also because mitochondrial inheritance is not uniparental. Here we propose original material to unravel mitotype impact on phenotype: we produced interspecific hybrids between S. cerevisiae and S. uvarum species, using fully homozygous diploid parental strains. For two different interspecific crosses involving different parental strains, we recovered 10 independent hybrids per cross, and allowed mtDNA fixation after around 80 generations. We developed PCR-based markers for the rapid discrimination of S. cerevisiae and S. uvarum mitochondrial DNA. For both crosses, we were able to isolate fully isogenic hybrids at the nuclear level, yet possessing either S. cerevisiae mtDNA (Sc-mtDNA) or S. uvarum mtDNA (Su-mtDNA). Under fermentative conditions, the mitotype has no phenotypic impact on fermentation kinetics and products, which was expected since mtDNA are not necessary for fermentative metabolism. Alternatively, under respiratory conditions, hybrids with Sc-mtDNA have higher population growth performance, associated with higher respiratory rate. Indeed, far from the hypothesis that mtDNA variation is neutral, our work shows that mitochondrial polymorphism can have a strong impact on fitness components and hence on the evolutionary fate of the yeast populations. We hypothesize that under fermentative conditions, hybrids may fix stochastically one or the other mt-DNA, while respiratory environments may increase the probability to fix Sc-mtDNA.									28	1	0	0	26	0	29			1932-6203			WOS:000326520200083	24086452

Despite its fastidious growth requirements, including low level of oxygen and high level of CO2, this pathogen is able to persist in the environment without permanent loss of its viability and virulence. As C. jejuni is not able to multiply outside a host, the cells spend significant amount of time in stationary phase of growth. The entry into the stationary phase is often correlated to resistance to various stresses in bacteria. The switching between exponential and stationary phases is frequently mediated by the regulator sigma S (RpoS). However, this factor is absent in C. jejuni and molecular mechanisms responsible for transition of cells to the stationary phase remain elusive. In this work, proteomic profiles of cells from exponential and stationary phases were compared using 2-D electrophoresis (2DE) fingerprinting combined with mass spectrometry analysis and qRT-PCR. The identified proteins, whose expression differed between the two phases, are mostly involved in protein biosynthesis, carbon metabolism, stress response and motility. Altered expression was observed also in the pleiotropic regulator CosR that was over-expressed during stationary phase. A shift between transcript and protein level evolution of CosR throughout the growth of C. jejuni was observed using qRT-PCR and (2DE). From these data, we hypothesized that CosR could undergo a negative autoregulation in stationary phase. A consensus sequence resulting from promoter sequence alignment of genes potentially regulated by CosR, including its own upstream region, among C. jejuni strains is proposed. To verify experimentally the potential autoregulation of CosR at the DNA level, electrophoretic mobility shift assay was performed with DNA fragments of CosR promoter region and rCosR. Different migration pattern of the promoter fragments indicates the binding capacity of CosR, suggesting its auto-regulation potential.									6	0	0	0	6	0	6			1664-302X			WOS:000401691800001	28572800

In this communication, we have developed a facile surfactant-free nanofabrication approach to confine dense Au nanoparticles in N-doped TiO2 bowl nanoarrays. By tuning the light absorption of TiO2 to sufficiently overlap the plasmonic band of Au nanoparticles, the utilization of plasmonics in charge generation and separation by resonant energy transfer is well synergized with the Schottky junction for enhanced photocatalytic water splitting, achieving H-2 production rates of 637 mu mol g(-1) h(-1) in full spectrum and 132 mu mol g(-1) h(-1) in visible region, respectively. This work represents a step towards large-scale photocatalyst fabrication and full spectrum photocatalysis, and opens a new window to rationally designing hybrid structures for photocatalysis.

Therefore, electrochemical energy conversion devices like fuel cells, electrolyzes, and supercapacitors along with photoelectrochemical devices and batteries have high potential to become increasingly important in the near future. Catalytic performance in electrochemical energy conversion results from the tailored properties of complex nanometer-sized metal and metal oxide particles, as well as support nanostructures. Exposed facets, surface defects, and other structural and compositional features of the catalyst nanoparticles affect the electrocatalytic performance to varying degrees. The characterization of the nanometer-size and atomic regime of electrocatalysts and its evolution over time are therefore paramount for an improved understanding and significant optimization of such important technologies like electrolyzers or fuel cells. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and scanning transmission electron microscope (STEM) are to a great extent nondestructive characterization tools that provide structural, morphological, and compositional information with nanoscale or even atomic resolution. Due to recent marked advancement in electron microscopy equipment such as aberration corrections and monochromators, such insightful information is now accessible in many institutions around the world and provides huge benefit to everyone using electron microscopy characterization in general.Classical ex situ TEM characterization of random catalyst locations however suffers from two limitations regarding catalysis. First, the necessary low operation pressures in the range of 10(-6) to 10(-9) mbar for TEM are not in line with typical reaction conditions, especially considering electrocatalytic solid liquid interfaces, so that the active state cannot be assessed. Second, and somewhat related, is the lack of time resolution for the evaluation of alterations of the usually highly heterogeneous nanomaterials. Two methods offer a solution to these shortcomings, namely, identical location TEM (IL-TEM) and electrochemical in situ liquid TEM. The former is already well established and has delivered novel insights particularly into degradation processes; however, characterization is still performed in vacuum. The latter circumvents this issue by using dedicated in situ TEM holders but introduces extremely demanding technical challenges. Although the introduction of revolutionizing thin SiN window cells, which elegantly confine the specimen from vacuum, has allowed demonstration of the potential of the in situ approach, the reproducibility and data interpretation is still limited predominately due to the strong interaction of the electron beam with the supporting electrolyte and electrode material. Because of the importance of understanding the nanoelectrochemical structure-function relationship, this Account aims to convey a timely perspective on the opportunities and particularly the challenges in electrochemical identical location TEM and in situ liquid cell TEM with a focus on electrochemical energy conversion.									123	1	0	0	10	0	124			0001-4842	1520-4898		WOS:000384038600043	27541965

The structural properties of the obtained materials were analyzed by X-ray diffraction (XRD), nitrogen adsorption-desorption, scanning and transmission electron microscopy (SEM, TEM), EDAX analysis, X-ray photoelectron microscopy (XPS), ultraviolet-visible diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (UV-vis DRS) and Fourier transformation infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR). The results indicated that Ce and Ti were highly dispersed or incorporated into the framework of the cubic SiMCM-48, with an enhanced light-trapping effect both in the UV and Vis regions. When applied to the photocatalytic degradation of phenol, the best results were obtained for the bimetallic hybrid. The best activity of CeTiSiMCM-48 photocatalyst was ascribed to improved electron-hole pair separation efficiency and formation of more reactive oxygen species due to the presence of Ce4+/Ce3+. The mesoporous support increases the dispersability of the photoactive Ti4+ or Ce4+/Ce3+ species on the catalyst surface and the accessibility of the substrate to the active sites. Furthermore, the catalysts can be easily recovered and reused for four cycles without significant loss of activity. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

The Ni-Fe-P materials were first synthesized and in situ grown on nickel foam by typical hydrothermal and phosphating methods. The Ni-Fe-P-300 catalyst shows excellent water splitting activity (cell voltage of 1.59 V @10 mA cm(-2)) and stability after phosphating. The results of density functional theory (DFT) demonstrate that the water molecules preferentially adsorbed on the Fe site and Fe might be the real catalytic active site. A series of characterization indicated that a small amount of phosphorus loss was probably caused on the catalyst surface, but the electrocatalytic activity was not affected by the small amount of oxide species formation. This study offers a promising way to design and optimize electrocatalysts for the water splitting in alkaline solution. (C) 2020 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

This study exogenously overexpressed PtGSTF4 from Populus trichocarpa and its two orthologs from Populus yatungensis and Populus euphratica in Arabidopsis thaliana, respectively. To elucidate the function of three GSTF4 proteins in stress response, we compared germination and seedling growth in transgenic Arabidopsis with salt and drought treatments. All three Populus GSTF4 genes overexpressed Arabidopsis showed enhanced resistance to salt stress and drought. GSTF4 transgenic plants accumulated less hydrogen peroxide and more chlorophylls and decreased levels of lipid peroxidation under salt stress and drought comparing to the mock control plants. The difference observed by GSH and GSSG measurements indicated GSTF4 proteins may involve in glutathione-dependent peroxide scavenging which lead to reduced oxidative damage. The Arabidopsis transformed with the GSTF4 gene form P. euphratica showed higher germination rate and different performance of affecting GSSG contents comparing with the other two orthologous GST genes under NaCl treatment. These results suggested three Populus GSTF4 orthologs may have functional divergence in stress responding. This study provides insights into molecular mechanisms that underlie salt and drought stress tolerance of Phi GSTs and gives evidence for the functional divergence among orthologs in vivo.									16	0	0	0	12	0	16			0305-1978	1873-2925		WOS:000461002200014

The observed correlation between the Be abundance and the metallicity in metal-poor Population II stars requires that Be was synthesized in the early Galaxy. We show that the observations and such Population II GCR synthesis of Be are quantitatively consistent with the big bang nucleosynthesis production of Li-7. We find that there is a nearly model independent lower bound to B/Be of approximately 7 for GCR synthesis. Recent measurements of B/Be approximately 10 in HD 140283 are in excellent agreement with the predictions of Population II GCR nucleosynthesis. Measurements of the boron abundance in additional metal-poor halo stars is a key diagnostic of the GCR spallation mechanism. We also show that Population II CGR synthesis can produce amounts of Li-6 which may be observed in the hottest halo stars.									50	0	0	0	0	0	50			0004-637X			WOS:A1993LT20000011

Based on the dependence of the integrated absorption of the Si-O-Si asymmetric stretching modes normalized to the silicon atomic density on the x values evaluated by RBS, the proportionality coefficient Asio of the Si-O-Si asymmetric stretching modes was determined to be 2 x 10(19) cm(-2). Details of the Aso calculation, the dependence of the silicon atomic density on x, and the limits of integration were discussed. The significant overestimation of the x values obtained from the Si-O-Si stretching mode position in the IR spectra of the films in comparison with the actual values and the presence of a high-frequency shoulder centered at similar to 1140 cm(-1) in the IR spectra indicates the inhomogeneity of the structure of the films. At the same time, the parameters of the Si-O-Si asymmetric stretching band (position and full width at half maximum) indicate the absence of a strict phase separation in the structure of the synthesized films, which are thus described by the intermediate model.									13	0	4	0	0	0	17			0022-3093	1873-4812		WOS:000473841800006

The bonding strength of the cement on the second interface would deteriorate easily under complex geological conditions, resulting in annular fluid channeling and sustained casing pressure, which severely affects oil and gas development. Accurate understanding on the microstructure and evolution characteristics of hydration products on the second interface is fundamental to improve the sealing capacity of the cement sheath. In this study, an experimental device for testing the sealing capacity of the cement sheath is developed. The testing device has the ability to simulate various conditions including high temperature, high pressure, dynamic formation water, and real-core interface. Using the testing device, a testing procedure is established to determine the sealing capacity of the cement sheath on the second interface. Through analysis on the microstructure and components of interface products under curing conditions, and comparison of interface breakthrough pressure for different slurry systems, the following conclusions can be obtained The main reason for the failure of cementing on the second interface is the crystal growth of calcium hydroxide (Ca(OH)(2) or CH) and ettringite (3CaO center dot Al2O3 center dot 3CaSO(4)center dot 32H(2)O or AFt). With the further progress of the hydration reaction, crystals in the transition zone near the interface continue to expand, inhibiting the formation of calcium silicate hydrate (C-S-H) gel and causing insufficient bonding strength on the interface; The non-polar spacer liquid, the foam cement slurry, and a system of nano-liquid silicon cement slurry are recommended to be utilized to introduce non-polar groups and a silicon-oxygen (Si-O) bond for changing the surface energy of the interface, inhibiting the formation of crystals, enhancing the bonding between the C-S-H gel and the interface, increasing the cementing strength of C-S-H gel on the interface, and improving the sealing capacity of the cement sheath. In the paper, a new testing device is introduced and a testing method for the microstructure on the second interface is developed, and a new idea is provided for research and development on bonding strength reinforced functional materials, cement slurry and spacer fluid systems. Under experimental conditions in this work, the interfacial bonding strength is increased by 20% compared with the conventional cement slurry, which is expected to provide guidance and reference for improving the long-term sealing capacity on the well cementation second interface.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0920-4105	1873-4715		WOS:000688639800003

Herein, we develop a facile method to synthesis the defective nitrogen-doped graphene encapsulated metal nanoparticles by pyrolysis of graphene-supermolecule complexes. The obtained catalyst exhibits superior activities toward ORR (E-1/2 = 0.864 V), OER (eta =383 mV@10 mA/cm(2)) and HER (eta = 193 mV@10 mA/cm(2)) in 0.1 M KOH solution. Equipping the materials into a rechargeable zinc-air battery produces a peak power density of 205 mW/cm(2) and a cycle life of 667 h. It is found that formative M-N-x and defective N-doped graphene are the main origins of ORR activity while OER and HER activities are attributed to the defect-rich N-doped C and Co core. This finding provides insights to design electrocatalyst with both multifunctional catalytic activities and high stability.									73	1	0	0	2	0	73			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000591342100001		
J	Allen, NS; Edge, M; Rodriguez, M; Liauw, CM; Fontan, E					Liauw, Christopher/0000-0001-9055-6704			Aspects of the thermal oxidation, yellowing and stabilisation of ethylene vinyl acetate copolymer								POLYMER DEGRADATION AND STABILITY				71	1			1	14						2001	2001	The thermal oxidation of ethylene-vinyl acetate copolymer [EVA-17 and 28% w/w VA (vinyl acetate) units] has been examined by thermo-gravimetric and hydroperoxide analysis, FTIR (Fourier transform infra-red), fluorescence spectroscopy and yellowness index. Thermal analysis indicates the initial loss of acetic acid followed by oxidation and breakdown of the main chain. The degradation rate is greater in an oxygen atmosphere as is the formation of coloured products. FTIR spectroscopic analysis of the oxidised EVA shows evidence for de-acetylation followed by the concurrent formation of hydroxyl/hydroperoxide species, ketone groups, a, P-unsaturated carbonyl groups, conjugated dienes, lactones and various substituted vinyl types. Hydroperoxide evolution follows typical auto-oxidation kinetics forming ketonic species. In severely oxidised EVA, evidence is given for the subsequent formation of anhydride groups. The initial fluorescence excitation and emission spectra of EVA is not unlike that reported for polyolefins confirming the presence of low levels of unsaturated carbonyl species. There are, however, significant differences in a long wavelength component in the fluorescence emission indicating the presence of other active chromophores. These long wavelength emitting components grow in intensity and shift to longer wavelengths with ageing time. However, unlike studies on PVC these emission spectra are limited due to the vinyl polyconjugation lengths and tend to be consistent with the formation of specific degraded units, possibly polyunsaturated carbonyl species of a limited length confined to the EVA blocks. During oxidation of EVA the original unsaturated carbonyl species remain as distinct emitting chromophores. This suggests that the growth and decay of these chromphores is virtually constant indicating that they could be an integral part of the EVA polymer that are responsible for inducing degradation. Degradation is limited to the vinyl acetate moieties where hydroperoxides can lead to the formation of polyconjugated carbonyl groups. The EVA degradation is therefore, different from that of PVC where in the latter case polyconjugated vinyl groups are evident through conjugated absorption bands in the UV spectrum. In the case of degraded EVA no such bands are observed. Also, degraded coloured EVA is not bleached by treatment with bromine, maleic anhydride or peracetic acid. Primary phenolic antioxidants exhibit variable activity in inhibiting the yellowing of EVA while combinations with phosphites and hindered piperidine stabilisers display powerful synergism confirming the importance of hydroperoxides as precursors. Thermal oxidation was also was displayed through the inhibition of lactone, carboxylic acid and alkene groups illustrating the fact that oxidation and yellowing are synonymous reactions.

The visible light response of WO3 with a long hole diffusion length (similar to 150 nm) and good electron mobility (similar to 12 cm(2) V-1 s(-1)) makes it suitable as the photoanode. However, WO3 suffers from issues including rapid recombination of photoexcited electron-hole pairs, photo-corrosion during the photocatalytic process due to the formation of peroxo-species, sluggish kinetics of photogenerated holes, and slow charge transfer at the semiconductor/electrolyte interface. This work highlights the approaches to overcome these drawbacks of WO3 photoanodes, including: (i) the manipulation of nanostructured WO3 photoanodes to decrease the nanoparticle size to promote hole migration to the WO3/electrolyte interface which benefits the charge separation; (ii) doping or introducing oxygen vacancies to improve electrical conductivity; exposing high energy crystal surfaces to promote the consumption of photogenerated holes on the high-active crystal face, thereby suppressing the recombination of photogenerated electrons and holes; (iii) decorating with co-catalysts to reduce the overpotential which inhibits the formation of peroxo-species; (iv) other methods such as coupling with narrow band semiconductors to accelerate the charge separation and controlling the crystal phase via annealing to reduce defects. These approaches are reviewed with detailed examples.									111	7	0	0	8	0	113			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000498821300003	31361294

The method uses [1-C-14]ribulose bisphosphate as substrate and combines the advantages of supplying both gaseous substrates from the gas phase with HPLC separation of the labelled products. Volumetric or gravimetric accuracy is not required at any stage of the procedure and variations in ionic strength and pH have little effect on the measurements. This leads to excellent reproducibility without the need for normalisation. The average standard deviation was 1.3% of the measured CO2/O-2 specificity. Use of very low ribulose bisphosphate concentrations ensures that the gaseous substrates cannot be depleted appreciably during the reaction and enhances the attractiveness of the procedure for measurements with crippled mutant enzymes. The procedure's ability to resolve small differences in relative specificity is demonstrated by its easy detection of the 5% increase in specificity that accompanies substitution of four residues at positions 338-341 of the cyanobacterial large subunit with the analogous higher-plant residues. This resolving power is essential for detecting small differences in the specificities of higher-plant ribulosebisphosphate carboxylases which may be the signature of continuing evolutionary refinement.									111	0	0	0	100	0	112			0310-7841			WOS:A1994NZ41500004

The most common oxidized alteration mineral of enargite is probably scorodite, FeASO(4)center dot 2H(2)O, with iron provided most likely by pyrite, a phase almost ubiquitously associated with enargite. Other secondary minerals after enargite include arsenates such as chenevixite, Cu2Fe2(ASO(40))(2)(OH)(4)center dot H2O, and ceruleite, Cu2Al7(AsO4)(4)center dot 11 center dot 5H(2)O, and sulphates such as brochantite, Cu-4(SO4)(OH)(6), and posnjakite, Cu-4(SO4)(OH)(6) center dot H2O. Detailed studies of enargite field alteration at Furtei, Sardinia, suggest that most alteration occurs through dissolution, as testified by the appearance of etch pits at the surface of enargite crystals. However, apparent replacement by scorodite and cuprian melanterite was observed.Bulk oxidation of enargite in air is a very slow process. However, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) reveals subtle surface changes. From synchrotron-based XPS it was suggested that surface As atoms react very fast, presumably by forming bonds with oxygen. Conventional XPS shows the formation, on aged samples, of a nanometer-size alteration layer with an appreciably distinct composition with respect to the bulk. Mechanical activation considerably increases enargite reactivity.In laboratory experiments at acidic to neutral pH, enargite oxidation/dissolution is slow, although it is accelerated by the presence of ferric iron and/or bacteria such as Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans and Sulfolobus BC. In the presence of sulphuric acid and ferric iron, the reaction involves dissolution of Cu and formation of native sulphur, subsequently partly oxidized to sulphate. At alkaline pH, the reactivity of enargite is apparently slightly greater. XPS spectra of surfaces conditioned at pH I I have been interpreted as evidence of formation of a number of surface species, including cupric oxide and arsenic oxide. Treatment with hypochlorite solutions at pH 12.5 quickly produces a coating of cupric oxide.Electrochemical oxidation of enargite typically involves low current densities, confirming that the oxidation process is slow. Important surface changes occur only at high applied potentials, e.g. +0.74 V vs. SHE. It is confirmed that, at acidic pH, the dominant process is Cu dissolution, accompanied (at +0.56 V vs. SHE, pH = 1) by formation of native sulphur. At alkaline pH, a number of surface products have been suggested, including copper and arsenic oxides, and copper arsenates. XPS studies of the reacted surfaces demonstrate the evolution of Cu from the monovalent to the divalent state, the formation of As-O bonds, and the oxidation of sulphur to polysulphide, sulphite and eventually sulphate.In most natural and quasi-natural (mining) situations, it is expected that enargite reactivity will be slow. Moreover, it is likely that the release of arsenic will be further slowed down by at least temporary trapping in secondary phases. Therefore, an adequate management of exposed surfaces and wastes should minimize the environmental impact of enargite-bearing deposits.In spite of an increasing body of data, there are several gaps in our knowledge of enargite oxidation. The exact nature of most mechanisms and products remains poorly constrained, and there is a lack of quantitative data on the dependence on parameters such as pH and dissolved oxygen.

The effect of temperature (heat and cold) stress on growth, secondary metabolite levels and defense mechanism in two genotypes (prickled and prickleless) of S. viarum was evaluated. The two thermal regimes (4 degrees C for cold and 35 degrees C for heat stress) were found to be the most optimum for the accumulation of metabolites (steroidal alkaloids and glycoalkaloids, phenolic acids as well as flavonoids). Prickleless genotype showed 4.08 and 1.51 fold higher total alkaloids/glycoalkaloid content at 35 degrees C and 4 degrees C temperatures respectively, in comparison with prickled plants. Prickleless plants also registered 2.03 and 2.28 higher fresh and dry biomass accumulation respectively, under cold stress over the control plants. The accretion of phenolic and flavonoid compounds under heat and cold stress is mainly contributed by gallic and ferulic acid in both the genotypes. The quantitative real-time PCR expression analysis showed the abundance of gene transcript involve in the biosynthesis of alkaloids/glycoalkaloid and phenolics/flavonoids that corroborates with the accumulation of their respective metabolites in prickleless plants under temperature stress. Results revealed that the prickleless plants inhibiting the reactive oxygen species (ROS) mediated oxidative damage by activating the enzymatic (superoxide dismutase, peroxidase, catalase and ascorbate peroxidase) and non-enzymatic (alkaloids, phenols, flavonoids, carotenoids and proline) antioxidants mechanism that confirms its efficiency to tolerate thermal stress under both the thermal regimes. The overall result showed that the prickleless genotype served as a better accumulator of biomass, secondary metabolites with an improved antioxidative mechanism in comparison to prickled genotype. Our findings suggest that thermal stress responses differ significantly between genotypes, emphasizing the necessity of maintaining genotypic diversity in adaptive evolution as in the context of global warming and climate change. The present study also opens the possibility of exploiting improved prickleless genotype of S. viarum as a potential system that can be cultivated under different temperature stress conditions to attain the phytopharmaceutical benefits.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			0098-8472	1873-7307		WOS:000744240100007

Understanding recharging processes for DWLW is a key step for better protection of the oasis, but poorly studied. To this end, we carried out a comprehensive water chemistry and isotope sampling and analysis, by taking the oasis and its water sources as a complete system to reveal the oasis water recharging mechanism and flow paths. Water samples, including mountain snowmelt water, river water, groundwater, spring and lake water, were collected within and around the DWLW, and their environmental isotopes (delta O-18 and delta D) and water chemistry were analysed. Results showed that the stable isotope values exhibited strong spatial variations, ranging from -90.69 parts per thousand to -42.45 parts per thousand for dD and from -13.81 parts per thousand to -2.90 parts per thousand for delta O-18. The isotope values were extremely depleted for snowmelt water, followed by river water, groundwater, spring water, and were most enriched in lake water. The difference in isotopic values from the different water bodies indicates that seasonal rivers primarily originate from the snowmelt water in the adjacent mountains, discharge into the aquifer through infiltration, then groundwater rises up by forms of springs to the lake oases, the river and groundwater interacted frequently, causing significant changes in solute in different positions. The ion concentrations accumulated continuously along the flow path, the total dissolved solid content varied from 416 mg/L in river water to 20360 mg/L in lake water, and the dominant anion facies changed systematically from HCO3- to SO42- then Cl-. The ionic ration plot, chlor-alkali index and saturation index demonstrated that dissolution of minerals plays a major role in the change in chemical composition, and other processes such as carbonate precipitation associated with cation exchange reaction also influence the chemical composition. Our results are helpful for understanding the hydrological and hydrochemical processes in arid groundwater-fed oases, and can be also useful for rational management and assessment of regional-scale groundwater resources in oases.									3	0	0	0	3	0	3			0022-1694	1879-2707		WOS:000652835600047

Therefore, exploring a useful way for tuning the bandgap of graphene is extremely important. To date, it is still a great challenge to modulate the bandgap of a monolayer graphene. Herein, we prepared a novel phosphorus-doped monolayer graphene with a tunable bandgap via a facile one-step synthesis strategy, where the bandgaps varied with the amount of phosphorus. Subsequently, the four-probe and Hall effect measurements successfully revealed the semiconductor characteristics of the phosphorus-doped monolayer graphene. When used as a photocatalyst material for water splitting without a cocatalyst, the phosphorus-doped monolayer graphene exhibited a high rate of H-2 production (up to 672.3 mu mol h(-1) g(-1)) and excellent stability. The high photocatalytic H-2-production activity benefited from the suitable bandgap (1.79 eV) and sufficient visible-light absorption capacity for the sample. Briefly, our study provides an effective way to synthesize a new type of photocatalysts based on a phosphorus-doped monolayer graphene with a tunable bandgap.									24	1	0	0	1	0	24			2050-7526	2050-7534		WOS:000483684600020

In this study, mixed transition metal oxide nanoparticles encapsulated in nitrogendoped carbon (denoted as AB(2)O(4)@NC) were developed using a one-pot protocol, wherein a metal-organic complex was adopted as the precursor. As a proof of concept, MnCo2O4@NC was used as an electrocatalyst for water oxidation, and demonstrated an outstanding electrocatalytic activity with low overpotential to achieve a current density of 10 mA center dot cm(-1) (eta (10) = 287 mV), small Tafel slope (55 mV center dot dec(-1)), and high stability (96% retention after 20 h). The excellent electrochemical performance benefited from the synergistic effects of the MnCo2O4 nanoparticles and nitrogen-doped carbon, as well as the assembled mesoporous nanowire structure. Finally, a highly stable all-solid-state supercapacitor based on MnCo2O4@NC was demonstrated (1.5% decay after 10,000 cycles).									69	5	0	0	5	0	69			1998-0124	1998-0000		WOS:000375624400008		
J	Yan, Gang; Zhang, Xiaotong; Xiao, Liguang				Yan, Gang/ABH-2696-2021				Prussian blue analogues-derived bimetallic phosphide hollow nanocubes grown on Ni foam as water splitting electrocatalyst								JOURNAL OF MATERIALS SCIENCE				54	9			7087	7095		10.1007/s10853-019-03362-6				MAY 2019	2019	The development of highly active and stable electrocatalysts for the water splitting using the earth-abundant transition metal as precursor is important for the renewable energy application. Prussian blue analogues (PBAs) are regarded as an ideal precursor for the preparation of electrocatalysts because of its abundant metal elements and various derived porous nanostructures. In this work, the (NiCo)(2)P hollow nanocubes, which are firmly grown on Ni foam, are prepared by PBAs and used as an water splitting electrocatalyst with high activity and stability in 1 M KOH solution. Benefiting from the synergistic effect of nickel and cobalt, hollow structure and high double-layer capacitance, the as-synthesized (NiCo)(2)P/NF catalyst shows an excellent electrocatalytic performance for the water splitting. To achieve current density of 10 mA cm(-2), for HER and OER, this material requires overpotentials of 162 mV and 220 mV, respectively. As an integrated electrocatalyst for water splitting, the (NiCo)(2)P/NF needs a cell voltage of 1.62 V to achieve current density of 10 mA cm(-2). Furthermore, this material has long-term electrocatalytic stability (over 30 h). The high catalytic activity of this material is attributed to the synergistic effect of component and the hollow structure of catalyst. This facile and novel method of preparing bimetallic phosphide electrocatalysts with hollow structure provides a broadened space for the design and synthesis of non-noble metal catalysts in the future.									22	0	0	0	0	0	22			0022-2461	1573-4803		WOS:000458655200029

Core-sheath structure CdS/polyacrylonitrile (PAN) fiber was prepared via successive ionic layer adsorption and reaction (SILAR) method on the surface of PAN fiber. PPy was further deposited on the CdS/PAN fiber by vapor deposition polymerization. After the removal of interior PAN template, PPy/CdS hollow fiber was yielded. The hollow structure of PPy/CdS hollow fiber was confirmed by morphology observation. The resulting PPy/CdS hollow fiber presents low energy band gaps of 1.9 eV, which accounts for enhanced visible light photocatalytic activity after PPy deposition. PPy/CdS hollow fiber shows good dye removal efficiency of 73.06 wt% (dosage of the product as low as 5 mg.10 mL(-1)), and praiseworthy H-2 production rate up to 269.7 mu mol.g(-1).h(-1). PPy/CdS hollow fiber maintained high and sustainable photocatalytic activity compared to CdS/PAN fiber after 8 cycles, indicating that PPy effectively improved the stability of CdS. Here, PPy plays key synergistic role in photocatalysis of PPy/CdS hollow fiber for the promotive and protective effects based on the actual photocatalytic performance and inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometer (ICP-OES) results. Compared with nano-sized photocatalysts, the fiber-formed PPy/CdS hollow fiber is highly bulky and easy to recycle. PPy/CdS hollow fiber has great potential for scale-up in industrial application because of its excellent grabbing ability and degradation to contaminants, and ease of disposal. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc.

The latter involve plants of three orders, Fagales, Rosales, and Cucurbitales. To understand the diversity of plant symbiotic adaptation, we compared the nodule transcriptomes of Datisca glomerate (Datiscaceae, Cucurbitales) and Ceanothus thyrsiflorus (Rhamnaceae, Rosales); both species are nodulated by members of the uncultured Frankia Glade, cluster II. The analysis focused on various features. In both species, the expression of orthologs of legume Nod factor receptor genes was elevated in nodules compared to roots. Since arginine has been postulated as export form of fixed nitrogen from symbiotic Frankia in nodules of D. glomerate, the question was whether the nitrogen metabolism was similar in nodules of C. thyrsiflorus. Analysis of the expression levels of key genes encoding enzymes involved in arginine metabolism revealed up-regulation of arginine catabolism, but no up-regulation of arginine biosynthesis, in nodules compared to roots of D. glomerate, while arginine degradation was not upregulated in nodules of C. thyrsiflorus. This new information corroborated an arginine-based metabolic exchange between host and microsymbiont for D. glomerate, but not for C. thyrsiflorus. Oxygen protection systems for nitrogenase differ dramatically between both species. Analysis of the antioxidant system suggested that the system in the nodules of D. glomerate leads to greater oxidative stress than the one in the nodules of C. thyrsiflorus, while no differences were found for the defense against nitrosative stress. However, induction of nitrite reductase in nodules of C. thyrsiflorus indicated that here, nitrite produced from nitric oxide had to be detoxified. Additional shared features were identified: genes encoding enzymes involved in thiamine biosynthesis were found to be upregulated in the nodules of both species. Orthologous nodule-specific subtilisin-like proteases that have been linked to the infection process in actinorhizal Fagales, were also upregulated in the nodules of D. glomerate and C. thyrsiflorus. Nodule-specific defensin genes known from actinorhizal Fagales and Cucurbitales, were also found in C. thyrsiflorus. In summary, the results underline the variability of nodule metabolism in different groups of symbiotic plants while pointing at conserved features involved in the infection process.									5	0	0	0	5	0	5			1664-462X			WOS:000450073400001	30487804

The view discussed here relates the immunological system inextricably to the metabolism of iron, the circulation of the blood and the resolution of the evolutionary paradox created by oxygen and iron.Indirect evidence for this inextricable relationship between the two systems can be derived from the discrepancy between the theoretical quasi-impossibility of the existence of an iron deficiency state in the adult and the reality of the WHO numbers of people in the world with iron deficiency anemia.With the mounting evidence that TNF, IL-1, and T lymphocyte cytokines affect hemopoieisis and iron metabolism it is possible that the reported discrepancy is a reflection of that inextricable interdependence between the two systems in the face of infection. Further direct evidence for a relationship between T cell subset numbers and iron metabolism is presented from the results of a study of T cell populations in patients with hereditary hemochromatosis. The recent finding of a correlation between low CD8+ lymphocyte numbers, liver damage associated with HCV positivity and severity of iron overload in B-thalassemia major patients (unpublished data of RW Grady, P. Giardina, M. Hilgartner) concludes this review.									19	0	0	0	13	0	19			0074-0276	1678-8060		WOS:A1992LW33100004	1342713

To obtain pure H-2 fuel, it is inevitably required to separate the H-2/O-2 product gas mixture, mainly relying on a membrane system at the current stage. However, this process has inherent durability and cost issues due to contamination, corrosion and its complex configuration. In our current work, we invented a highly compact gas separation and collection method in a water electrolysis system, which is set onto a biomimetically modified electrode without the use of a membrane or external convective flow. A key idea of this smart, compact and self-driven system is gas bubble manipulation by buoyant force and a slippery liquid infused porous surface (SLIPS). With the critical help of the biomimetic SLIPS wall by blocking bubble leakage, H-2 and O-2 product gases can be separately collected at the corresponding collection port. As a result, we achieved a remarkably improved H-2 collection value of over 90% with high purity using this membrane-free electrolysis system in which the product gases are separated only by their intrinsic buoyancy. This simple but effective gas separation/collection system is also applied to a highly compact, monolithic artificial leaf, in which the solar water splitting is practicably and conveniently conducted in a compact, floatable design.									12	0	0	0	1	0	12			2211-2855	2211-3282		WOS:000461433600054

However, its application as anodic cocatalyst in photoelectrochemical cells (PECs) is limited by poor optical properties: it becomes black at positive biasing. Here a pulsed laser deposition (PLD) method is used to produce amorphous nickel oxide thin films with optical and catalytic properties tailored for PECs. The procedure, based on the laser ablation of pure nickel in oxygen at relatively high pressure, allows obtaining a porous or compact layer by simply varying the substrate temperature. The film transmittance is higher than 90% in the visible range for a porous coating. The improved optical properties can solve the issue of parasitic light absorption when Ni oxides are used to functionalize photoanodes. A thin, porous coating of Ni oxides operated as a WOC also shows electrode metrics on-par with the best results in literature, with an overpotential of 355 mV at 1 mA cm(-2) and a 62 mV/decade Tafel slope. These results thus open the way for the use of Ni oxides as WOC for photoanodes. An in-depth study of the interplay between the morphological, optical and catalytic features of Ni oxides highlights the versatility of PLD in tuning materials properties.									9	0	0	0	0	0	9			1369-8001	1873-4081		WOS:000462768500005

Short wave UV assisted pyrolysis was conducted in oxygen atmosphere in order to obtain a fine and homogeneous grain structure. Phase pure thin films with a pronounced (100) texture were obtained at a fairly low annealing temperature of 600 degrees C. For comparison specimens processed without UV assisted pyrolysis were also investigated. It is shown that UV assisted pyrolysis leads to a substantial improvement of leakage resistance properties. Polarization switching could also be obtained using capacitance-voltage (C-V) curves. The leakage current was investigated as a function of temperature. Interpretation in terms of Frenkel-Poole mechanism leads to a high trap depth in the range of 2.4 eV which is attributed to the creation of Fe2+ centres. For both microstructures investigated well saturated magnetization loops were obtained with a remnant magnetization of 2Mr = 5.4 emu/cm(3) and a coercive fields in the range of 2Hc = 200 Oe. Slightly higher saturation magnetization 2Ms of 55.4 emu/cm(3) was obtained for UV assisted pyrolysis in comparison to 45.8 emu/cm(3) for the thin films processed without UV.									20	0	0	0	0	0	20			0928-0707	1573-4846		WOS:000245899500010

However, most or all of the residues that interact directly with Y-Z and the Mn cluster appear to be contributed by the D1 polypeptide.

Photocurrent is improved from 0.96 mAcm(-2) to 1.95 mAcm(-2) at 0.8 V upon Co-B-i incorporation, which plays as a hole collector and hole reservoir. Photocharging treatment leads to further improvements in the photocurrent from 0.96 mAcm(-2) to 1.31 mAcm(-2) and 1.95 mA cm(-2) to 2.63 mAcm(-2) for BV and BV/Co-B-i-3 respectively. The scanning electrochemical microscope (SECM) study reveals the improvement in the interfacial hole transfer kinetics from 7.23 x 10(-3) to 9.05 x 10(-3) cm s(-1) and 9.61 x 10(-3) to 11.76 x 10(-3) cm s(-1) for BV and BV/Co-B-i-3, respectively, upon photocharging. The SECM mapping of the interface reflects the localized photoelectrochemical activity of photoanodes. The improvements in the feedback photocurrents upon the Co-B-i incorporation confirm the improved interfacial charge transfer kinetics. Photocharging leads to further improve in the photocurrent for BV and BV/Co-B-i. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			0013-4686	1873-3859		WOS:000609069000009

LCNP@NCNF featured an integrated structure with well-crystallized perovskite nanoparticles uniformly distributed in micro/mesoporous NCNF. In addition, LCNP@NCNF exhibited a high specific surface area of similar to 183.3 m(2) g(-1) and a large pore volume of similar to 0.164 m(3) g(-1). The rotating electrode measurement revealed the better intrinsic activity and more favorable stability of LCNP@NCNF in comparison with their counterparts. Moreover, Zn-air batteries employing LCNP@NCNF showed a relatively smaller discharge-charge voltage gap of similar to 0.95 V and longer cycling stability than the battery adopting the physically blended LCNP and NCNF. We ascribed the improved electrochemical activity to the enhanced synergistic interaction originating from the successful coupling of LCNP and NCNF. (C) 2020 Elsevier Inc.

The spinel with a nano-morphology is elaborated by the sol gel method at similar to 850 degrees C. The X-ray diffraction pattern exhibits narrow peak characteristics that reveals a good crystallization. The capacitance(-2)-potential (C-2-E) plot of the semiconductor ZnCo2O4 indicates p type behavior from which a flat band potential of +0.30 V-SCE is determined. The energy band diagram, built from the physic-chemical properties, clearly predicts the electron transfer from the conduction band of ZnCo2O4 toward dissolved oxygen via ZnO. Indeed, the ZnCo2O4/ZnO composite improves the photocatalytic performance, where the colloidal photochemical hetero-system is successfully used for the light induced Ponceau 4R oxidation. The spinel dose and Ponceau 4R concentration are optimized. The conversion rate is controlled by UV-Visible spectrophotometry and, under the ideal conditions, the oxidation of 70% of Ponceau 4R (15 ppm) is obtained in aerated solution for less than 4 h when exposed to the solar light. The oxidation obeys a first order kinetic with a half-photocatalytic life of 130 min (k similar to 52 x 10(-4) min(-1)).									9	0	0	0	3	0	9			0947-8396	1432-0630		WOS:000552390900001

The photocathode was capable of utilizing photons up to 900 nm, while the onset potential was evaluated to be as high as 0.8 V-RHE. Modification with thin CdS and ZnS layers significantly increases the cathodic photocurrent through the formation of a surface p-n junction. The half-cell solar-to-hydrogen conversion efficiency of 0.83% at 0.33 V-RHE obtained from this device is among the highest yet reported for a photocathode fabricated from a particulate photocatalyst. A solar to hydrogen conversion efficiency of 0.60% was observed during bias-free overall water splitting using this photocathode together with a BiVO4 photoanode. The present work clearly demonstrates the possibility of efficient hydrogen generation using durable particulate semiconductor photoelectrodes.									20	0	0	0	2	0	20			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000413189100019

Herein, we developed an ultrasensitive, stable and selective colorimetric assay having dual functionalities of Au-tipped Pt nanorods (NRs). The optical and catalytic properties of Au-tipped Pt NRs were monitored using a spectrophotometer and the chromogenic substrate 3, 3 ', 5, 5 '-tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) in the presence of H2O2, respectively. We found that Au-tipped Pt NRs exhibited excellent peroxidase-like activity, which decomposed hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) into oxygen (O-2). The produced O-2 oxidized the chromogenic substrate into a blue color product. The oxidation rate of the chromogenic substrate could be monitored using a spectrophotometer at 652 nm. Notably, the peroxidase-like activity of Au-tipped Pt NRs decreased in the presence of ascorbic acid (AA). The produced O-2 preferentially reacted with AA, generating ascorbyl radicals (AA center dot) instead of oxidizing TMB, and thereby decreased the oxidation rate of TMB. Based on this inhibitory property, a selective colorimetric assay was developed using Au-tipped Pt NRs for the detection of AA. This work offers a novel detection method for AA.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0				2073-4344		WOS:000592750300001

In this work, the onset potentials of the Rh-STO electrodes were shifted in a wide range from 0 to 1.2 V vs. RHE via changing the amount of Rh dopants, or adjusting the ratio of Ti3+/Rh-4+,Rh-3+ cations through a vacuum-heating treatment. Namely, the photocathodic and photoanodic behavior of this material was successfully altered. The Rh-4+,Rh-3+ cations that composing the acceptor energy levels of Rh-STO were characterized with UV-Vis diffuse reflectance and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopies. Visible-light-driven low-biased photoelectrochemical water splitting was achieved by connecting the as-prepared Rh-STO photoanode and photocathode in series. This work provides a new strategy of accomplishing overall water splitting using only one kind of semiconductor photocatalyst. (C) 2020 Elsevier Inc.

J	SIMMONS, SF; CHRISTENSON, BW								ORIGINS OF CALCITE IN A BOILING GEOTHERMAL SYSTEM								AMERICAN JOURNAL OF SCIENCE				294	3			361	400		10.2475/ajs.294.3.361				MAR 1994	1994	The formation of hydrothermal calcite relates to the movement of carbon dioxide in a geothermal system as governed by boiling, dilution, and condensation. In this paper we show how these processes control the occurrence, distribution, and stable isotope composition of calcite based on a study at Broadlands-Ohaaki.The two principal calcite occurrences in the Broadlands-Ohaaki geothermal system are: (1) as replacement of rock forming minerals and volcanic glass; and (2) as platy crystals infilling voids. Both are stable over a broad temperature range from < 160-degrees to >300-degrees-C. Replacement calcite is widespread and forms through hydrolysis reactions involving calcium alumino-silicates and sub-boiling liquids that contain 0.3 to 0.75 m CO2. Platy calcite, in contrast, forms over a restricted vertical interval of a few hundred meters within the upflow zone. It precipitates from boiling fluids through exsolution of carbon dioxide as indicated by coeval liquid-rich and vapor-rich fluid inclusions and its formation in the two-phase zone.Fluid inclusion data help to define the boiling paths of fluids from which platy calcite formed. Homogenization temperatures range from 160-degrees to 310-degrees-C and are consistent within the present geothermal regime. Ice melting temperatures range from 0.0-degrees to - 1.0-degrees-C and indicate the presence of up to 0.5 m dissolved carbon dioxide. Model boiling curves calculated to match these data show how the concentration of dissolved carbon dioxide in the preboiled fluid dictates the depth of first boiling. Most fluid inclusion data lie along a model boiling path characteristic of the center of the upflow zone, in which the rising fluid (initially containing 0.75 M CO2) begins to boil at approximately 320-degrees-C and approximately 2000 m depth; data from well Br-18 instead matches a curve in which the rising fluid (initially containing 0.53 M CO2) begins boiling at approximately 245-degrees-C and approximately 900 m depth. The shallowing of the depth of first boiling likely results from dilution of dissolved carbon dioxide in the parent chloride water, as it rises and mixes with marginal waters.Calcite precipitates from both shallow formed steam-heated groundwater and deeply derived chloride water, and these waters are isotopically distinct. At Broadlands-Ohaaki, the deltaO-18 values of calcite at >200-degrees-C range from 0.5 to 7.5 permil, whereas deltaO-18 values of calcite at <200-degrees-C range from 4 to 10 permil. Taking appropriate temperature dependent fractionation factors into account, these data indicate equilibration with chloride water (deltaO-18(H2O) = -4.5 permil) and steam-heated ground water (deltaO-18(H2O) = - 7.0 permil), respectively. Oxygen isotopes of hydrothermal calcites in the nearby Wairakei and Waiotapu geothermal systems show similar patterns, consistent with the occurrence of both chloride and steam-heated waters there.Calcite formation is explained by a model that describes the distribution of two-phase conditions and aqueous carbon dioxide concentrations in a column of hydrothermal fluid rising through a rock matrix of isotropic permeability. In this ideal situation, platy calcite forms along the inner margin of the two-phase zone, having the shape of an inverted cone, whereas replacement calcite mostly forms in the surrounding one-phase liquid-only zone. The sparse occurrence of calcite at less-than-or-equal-to 800 m depth in the central upflow of the Ohaaki sector at Broadlands-Ohaaki is compatible with this model and appears related to the exsolution of dissolved carbon dioxide through boiling deeper in the system.									236	21	1	0	0	3	254			0002-9599			WOS:A1994MY89200004		
J	Qi, Delin; Xia, Mingzhe; Chao, Yan; Zhao, Yongli; Wu, Rongrong								Identification, molecular evolution of toll-like receptors in a Tibetan schizothoracine fish (Gymnocypris eckloni) and their expression profiles in response to acute hypoxia								FISH & SHELLFISH IMMUNOLOGY				68				102	113		10.1016/j.fsi.2017.07.014				SEP 2017	2017	Hypoxia plays an important role in regulating a variety of physiological responses as well as in pathological situations, but to date the roles of Toll-like receptors (TLRs) in fish in response to hypoxia are still poorly understood. Here, we sequenced the transcriptome of G. eckloni and identified the members of TLR family by scanning transcriptome, and then investigated the expression profiles of a complete set of TLRs in G. eckloni in response to acute hypoxia (4 h at DO = 0.3 +/- 0.1 mg/L). The de novo-assembled transcriptome consisted of a total of 162,235 transcripts, further clustered into 110,231 unigenes. Based on the transcriptome, a total of 18 TLRs were identified in G. eckloni, and of them three TLRs (TLR5, TLR8 and TLR22) possessed two distinct paralogous genes. The duplicated, genes of TLR22 were discovered for the first time in cyprinid fish, but did not origin from a recent duplication event. Of them TLR22b may be specific for schizothoracine fish, at least for G. eckloni. Phylogenetic analysis supported the classification of TLRs into six families as in other vertebrates but was partly different from the previous study. The sliding window analysis showed strong signals of positive selection in TLR2, TLR 4, TLR 5a, TLR 7, TLR 19, TLR 20, TLR 21, TLR 22a and TLR 22b, but most codons under positive selection were located in the putative LRR regions. The mRNA expression of most TLRs in head kidney, spleen and gill decreased significantly or remained unchanged under acute hypoxia, whereas acute hypoxia increased expressions of TLR2 and TLR3 in head kidney, of TLR8a, TLR12 and TLR19 in spleen, and of TLR1 in gill, suggesting tissues-specific expressions of TLRs play important roles in mediating innate immune responses for host defense against tissue damages or physiological changes induced by hypoxia.

J	Yan Qiushi; Gao Zhiyou; Ni Shijun; Shi Zeming; Yin Guan								Evolution of isotopic composition and deuterium excess of brines in the Sichuan Basin, China								Chinese Journal of Geochemistry				32	1			69	77		10.1007/s11631-013-0608-4				March 2013	2013	The isotopic composition and parameters for deuterium excess of brines, which were sampled in the Sichuan Basin, show obvious regularities of distribution. The brine isotopic composition shows distinct two systems of marine and terrestrial deposits, with the Middle Triassic strata as the boundary. Brine hydrogen isotopic composition of marine deposits is lower while oxygen isotopic composition is higher than that of the SMOW, respectively, indicating that the brines were derived from seawater with different evaporating degrees at different times. From the Sinian strata, up to the Cambrian, Permian Maokou Formation and the Triassic Jialingjiang Formation, the deltaD values of brines tend to become relatively positive with the strata becoming younger. Brines of terrestrial deposits are considered to have been derived from precipitation and their isotopic composition is close to the globe meteoric water line (GMWL). Brines of transitional deposits between marine and terrestrial ones (the Upper Triassic Xujiahe Formation) have deltaD and delta18O values falling between the two end members of marine deposit brines and precipitation, indicating that the brines are a mixture of precipitation and vaporing seawater. Water samples from the brine-bearing strata of different ages show various deuterium excesses (d) with an evident decreasing trend as the age of strata gets older and older. Brine-bearing strata of the Triassic Leikoupo-Jialingjiang Formation, the Permian Maokou Formation, the Cambrian and Sinian strata are all carbonate rocks which have experienced intensive water/rock reaction and the deuterium excess essentially changes with time. All brine-bearing-strata surrounding the basin or faults, as well as those brine wells exploited for resources, have been obviously influenced by the precipitation supply. Therefore, the deuterium excesses of their brines have increased to different extents, depending on the amount of involvement of meteoric water. The variation and distribution of d values of the brines from different Triassic strata are related to the embedded depth of the strata. The deuterium excesses of brines become lower with increasing burial depth of the strata.									1	2	0	0	0	0	3			1000-9426			INSPEC:13754974

We recently showed that Notch signaling was involved in the immune response of Litopenaeus vannamei shrimp. However, as an important transcriptional regulator of this pathway, whether or not shrimp CSL was also involved in immune response had not been explored. Here, we cloned and characterized the CSL gene in L. vannamei (LvCSL), which has a 2271 bp open reading frame (ORF) encoding a putative protein of 756 amino acids, and contains two conserved Lagl-DNA bind as well as beta trefoil domains (BTD). LvCSL clustered with invertebrates in the phylogenetic tree and closely related to the RBP Jk X1 of Parasteatoda tepidariortun. The transcript level of LvCSL analyzed by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) showed that LvCSL was widely expressed in all tissues tested, with induced levels observed in the hepatopancreas and hemocytes following immune challenge with Vibrio parahaemolyticus, Streptoccocus iniae, lipopolysaccharide (LPS), and white spot syndrome virus (WSSV), therefore, suggesting LvCSL involvement in shrimp immune response to pathogens. Besides, LvCSL knockdown decreased the expression of proliferation-related genes (LvHey2 and LvAstakine), and attenuated the expression of immune-related genes L. vannamei hypoxia inducible factor alpha (LvHIF-alpha), LvLectin and L. vannamei small subunit hemocyanin (LvHMCS) in shrimp hemocytes, as well as significantly decreased total hemocyte count. Moreover, high cumulative mortality was observed in LvCSL depleted shrimp challenged with V. parahaemoliticus. In conclusion, our present data strongly suggest that LvCSL is an important factor in shrimp, vital for shrimp survival and contributing to immune resistance to pathogens.									5	0	0	0	5	0	5			0145-305X	1879-0089		WOS:000443668600018	30031869

Methylene blue (MB) and methyl orange (MO) were considered for the degradation study as a step initiated towards the remediation of industrial wastewater. Subsequent characterization studies by x-ray diffraction (XRD) and field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) enumerate that the hexagonal-wurtzite structured Sm-ZnO is highly crystalline in nature and possesses hexagonal column like nano-architectures. Although, a charge imbalance exists between the ions, the substitutional effects of Sm3+ at Zn2+ sites have been observed from the XRD spectra and discussed by suitable mechanisms. FTIR measurement gives the information on the evolution of peaks related to metal-oxygen bond in Sm-ZnO which may be linked with Sm ions. PC measurement shows that the degradation efficiency of 95% can be achieved by Sm-ZnO photocatalysts in degrading MB and 91% for MO. Sm doping induces high charge separation efficiency and generation of OH ions in ZnO leading to such improvisation in degradation efficiency. The prepared Sm-ZnO nanocatalysts possess high degree of photostability and reusability even after fourth cycle of photodegradation. PL spectra show the suppression of the sharp and intense excitonic emission band of ZnO in Sm-ZnO due to low rated direct recombination of carriers. Incorporation of Sm3+ ends up with intrinsic defect mediated enhancement in the visible emissions especially in the blue, yellow and red region of light spectrum.									6	0	0	0	1	0	6				2632-959X		WOS:000658946900001

Herein, a house centipede-like bifunctional catalyst consisting of a molybdenum carbide nanorod grafted with N-doped carbon nanotubes (denoted as MoC-Mo2C/NCNTs) is developed for enhancing the performance of Li-O-2 batteries. This nanocatalyst is successfully fabricated by the post-treatment of MoO3 nanorods coated with a Co-based zeolitic imidazolate framework (ZIF-67). The obtained MoC-Mo2C/NCNT nanorods have a unique structure with a body comprising small MoC-Mo2C nanocrystals and Co@NCNTs extending like legs from it. This structural architecture not only provides numerous catalytic active sites and sufficient space for accommodating Li2O2 but also facilitates electron transport through the catalytically active NCNT conducive pathways. Consequently, the MoC-Mo2C/NCNTs show substantially improved electrocatalytic performance in Li-O-2 batteries with a significantly reduced discharge-charge overpotential (0.50 V), high specific discharge capacity (34,862 mA h g(-1) at 200 mA g(-1)), and long cycle stability (up to 162 cycles at current density of 200 mA g(-1)) and cut-off capacity of 500 mA h g(-1). Preliminary results suggest that the MoC-Mo2C/NCNT nanorod is an efficient, stable bifunctional catalyst for Li-O-2 batteries.									22	1	0	0	0	0	22			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000504405000038

Here, a multifunctional carbon cloth supported cobalt phosphide (CoP@CC) electrocatalyst was synthesized via a simple electrochemical deposition followed by subsequent phosphorization. This self-standing CoP@CC presents superior HER performance in both acid and alkaline media and excellent OER activity in an alkaline environment. When applied as both anode and cathode catalyst to overall water splitting, CoP@CC only required a low cell voltage of 1.68 V to drive a current density of 10 mA cm(-2), making this catalyst a potential candidate in industrial application. Moreover, inspired by its satisfying ORR activity, CoP@CC was first used as the air-electrode in zinc-air batteries, which outputted an open-circuit potential of 0.6 V and a power density of similar to 30 mW cm(-2).									77	3	0	0	2	0	77			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000417485000047	29182188

To this end, here we examine dihexyl-substituted poly(3,4-propylenedioxythiophene) (PProDOT-Hx(2)) as an electrochemically stable pi-conjugated polymer that becomes electrically conductive (up to 0.1 S cm(-1)) upon electrochemical doping in the potential range of 3.2 to 4.5 V (vs Li/Li+). Because this family of polymers is easy to functionalize, can be effectively fabricated into electrodes, and shows mixed electronic and ionic conductivity, PProDOT-Hx(2) shows promise for replacing the insulating polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) commonly used in commercial LIBs. A combined experimental and theoretical study is presented here to establish the fundamental mixed ionic and electronic conductivity of PProDOT-Hx(2). Electrochemical kinetics and electron spin resonance are first used to verify that the polymer can be readily electrochemically doped and is chemically stable in a potential range of interest for most cathode materials. A novel impedance method is then used to directly follow the evolution of both the electronic and ionic conductivity as a function of potential. Both values increase with electrochemical doping and stay high across the potential range of interest. A combination of optical ellipsometry and grazing incidence wide angle X-ray scattering is used to characterize both solvent swelling and structural changes that occur during electrochemical doping. These experimental results are used to calibrate molecular dynamics simulations, which show improved ionic conductivity upon solvent swelling. Simulations further attribute the improved ionic conductivity of PProDOT-Hx(2) to its open morphology and the increased solvation is possible because of the oxygen-containing propylenedioxythiophene backbone. Finally, the performance of PProDOT-Hx(2) as a conductive binder for the well-known cathode LiNi0.8Co0.15Al0.05O2 relative to PVDF is presented. PProDOT-Hx(2)-based cells display a fivefold increase in capacity at high rates of discharge compared to PVDF-based electrodes at high rates and also show improved long-term cycling stability. The increased rate capability and cycling stability demonstrate the benefits of using binders such as PProDOT-Hx(2), which show good electronic and ionic conductivity, combined with electrochemical stability over the potential range for standard cathode operation.									16	0	0	0	0	0	16			0897-4756	1520-5002		WOS:000592390700013		
J	Ignatov, I.I.; Mosin, O.V.								Colour coronal Kirlian spectral analysis in modeling nonequilibrium conditions with gas electric discharges, simulating primary atmosphere								Biomedicine Radioengineering					2			42	52						2014	2014	Kirlian effect designates the luminescence of coronal electric discharge on the surface of an object placed into variable electric field of high electric frequency and potential. Parameters of Kirlian effect are electric frequency (10-150 kHz) and electrical potential 5-30 kV. In scientific literature, along with Kirlian effect, the terms "bioelectonography", "electric high-frequency discharge" and "selective high-frequency discharge" are used. Kirlian effect has found application in biophysics and other branches of science and technics. The advantages of this method are safety, sterility, interpolation of data received, convenience of their storage and the subsequent computer processing, as well as the possibility of tracking the development of processes in time, comparisons of structural, functional, and time processes, etc. Scientifically-fundamental aspects of Kirlian effect consist in that Kirlian effect creates in laboratory conditions the gas selective electric discharge similar to the electric phenomena (lightning) and electrostatic discharges on the surface of biological, organic objects, and also on inorganic samples of various character, including water drops. For the last decades, in laboratory conditions using energy of electric field from inorganic substances have been synthesised various organic compounds - amino acids, proteins, and nucleosides. In these experiemens (S.Miller's experiments) were modelled the conditions of primary oxygen-free atmosphere, in which electrosynthesis of organic molecules from inorganic ones under the influence of energy of electric discharges, short-wave ultraviolet radiation of the Sun and other geothermal energy sources occurred. The purpose of the given work was studying the possibility of application of colour coronal Kirlian spectral analysis in modelling the nonequilibrium conditions with the gas electric discharges, simulating primary atmosphere and forecasting the possible electrochemical reactions proceeding at processing water with electric field of high electric potential and frequency. We submitted the data on research by colour coronal spectral Kirlian analysis and IR-spectroscopy water samples of various origin and various degree of water purification and water processing, and also samples of hot mineral, sea and mountain water from various sources of Bulgaria. In the frames of the research, the important parameter was measured - the average energy of hydrogen bonds between H2O molecules in the process of cluster formation was measured by the DNES method makes -0.1067 +or- 0.0011 eV.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1560-4136			INSPEC:14210019		
J	Yang, Limeng; Chang, Yaqing; Wang, Yi; Wei, Jing; Ge, Chen; Song, Jian								Identification and functional characterization of TNF receptor associated factor 3 in the sea cucumber Apostichopus japonicus								DEVELOPMENTAL AND COMPARATIVE IMMUNOLOGY				59				128	135		10.1016/j.dci.2016.01.021				JUN 2016	2016	TNF receptor associated factors (TRAFs) are a family of proteins primarily involved in both adaptive and innate immunity. In this study, we identified a novel TRAF3 gene in Apostichopus japonicus by transcriptome sequencing and RACE approaches (designated as AjTRAF3). The full-length of AjTRAF3 was of 2796 bp including a 5' untranslated region (UTR) of 83 bp, a 3' UTR of 1066 bp and a putative open reading frame of 1647 bp encoding a polypeptide of 548 amino acid residues. The representative domains such as a RING finger domain (residues 54-96), two TRAF domains with zinc finger structure (residues 141-228), a coiled coil and a meprin and TRAF homology (MATH) domain (residues 396-522) were all detected in the deduced amino acids of AjTRAF3. AjTRAF3 was ubiquitously expressed in all examined tissues with predominant expression in the body wall and slightly weaker in intestine, respiratory tree, tube feet, coelomocytes and longitudinal muscle. Time-course expression analysis in coelomocytes revealed that AjTRAF3 was significantly depressed towards Vibrio splendidus infection with a 0.20-fold decrease at 12 h, compared to control levels. AjTRAF3 silencing could elevate intracellular ROS levels by 2.08-fold and 2.09-fold compared to each control group in vitro and in vivo, respectively. Taken together, all these results suggested that AjTRAF3 may play a crucial role in the processes of anti-bacteria response in sea cucumber through regulating ROS production. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

The doping effects on the microstructure and magnetism for the powdered samples have been systematically investigated. Doping of Ni in TiO2 inhibited rutile crystal growth. The probable reason for this is discussed on the basis of band calculation based analysis of electronic structures of 3d transition metal-doped TiO2 and the energetic, transformation kinetics and phase stability of anatase over rutile as the function of particle size. Room temperature ferromagnetism (RTFM) with the saturation magnetization of 12 m emu g(-1) and Curie temperature as high as 820K is observed only in case of 0.05 mol% Ni:TiO2 powdered sample, whereas undoped TiO2 was diamagnetic and 0.5 mol% Ni:TiO2 was paramagnetic in nature. The role of any magnetic impurity or any Ni metal in the origin of the RTFM has been ruled out by energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and high resolution TEM (HRTEM) analysis, whereas magnetic force microscopy (MFM) established the presence of magnetic domains, supporting the intrinsic diluted magnetic semiconductor behavior. The observed ferromagnetism has been attributed to the spin ordering through exchange interaction between holes trapped in oxygen orbitals adjacent to Ni substitutional sites. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Expression of genes for atrial natriuretic peptide, brain natriuretic peptide, and calcium-calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II delta was measured via real-time PCR assay.Results-Ratios of heart weight to body weight for Tibetan antelope were significantly greater than those of Tibetan sheep, but ratios of right-left ventricular weights were similar. Mean +/- SD baseline heart rate (26.33 +/- 6.15 beats/min) and systolic arterial blood pressure (97.75 +/- 9.56 mm Hg) of antelope were significantly lower than those of sheep (34.20 +/- 6.57 beats/min and 130.06 +/- 1779 mm Hg, respectively). The maximum rate of rise in ventricular pressure in antelope was similar to that in Tibetan sheep, but after exposure to air providing a fraction of inspired oxygen of 14.6% or 12.5% (ie, hypoxic conditions), the maximum rate of rise in ventricular pressure of the antelope increased significantly to 145.1% or 148.1%, respectively, whereas that of the sheep decreased to 68.4% or 70.5%, respectively. Gene expression of calcium-calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II 8 and atrial natriuretic peptide, but not brain natriuretic peptide, in the left ventricle of the heart was significantly higher in antelope than in sheep.Conclusions and Clinical Relevance-Hearts of the Tibetan antelope in this study were well adapted to high-altitude hypoxia as shown by higher heart weight ratios, cardiac contractility in hypoxic conditions, and expression of key genes regulating cardiac contractility and cardiac hypertrophy, compared with values for Tibetan sheep.

In order to gain a better understanding of the prevalence of IHHNV in the Litopenaeus vannamei shrimp population of Shanghai, China, samples were collected during two cultivation seasons and subjected to diagnostic PCR. The results of this study showered that 167 out of 200 shrimp were positive for IHHNV, indicating a high viral pvalence (83.5 %) in farmed shrimp populations. Our results also indicated that there was a moderate correlation between IHHNV prevalence and water temperature, salinity and pH and only a slight correlation with the concentration of dissolved oxygen (DO). A mathematical model was developed in order to predict the relationship between these four characteristics of water quality and IHHNV prevalence, ultimately resulting in an estimate of the best water quality criteria (IHHNV prevalence = 0) where T = 30 A degrees C pH = 8.0, DO = 18.3 mg/L, and salinity = 1.5 aEuro degrees. Additionally, two IHHNV genotypes were identified, the sequencing of which revealed a high similarity to the known IHHNV genotypes based on a comparison of their nucleotide and amino acid sequences. Two types of repetitive sequences were detected at both the 5' and 3' ends of the non-coding regions, which are commonly found in other IHHNV genomic sequences. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that the IHHNV Shanghai genotypes were closely related to strains from Ganyu and Sheyang, but not to strains originating from Fujian, China. This finding suggests that IHHNVs have emerged independently several times in China.									4	2	0	0	4	0	6			0304-8608	1432-8798		WOS:000385252100021	27568013	
J	Suzuki, Hiroyuki; Taguchi, Yuta; Sugiura, Miwa; Boussac, Alain; Noguchi, Takumi				Noguchi, Takumi/I-7105-2014				Structural perturbation of the carboxylate ligands to the manganese cluster upon Ca2+/Sr2+ exchange in the S-state cycle of photosynthetic oxygen evolution as studied by flash-induced FTIR difference spectroscopy								BIOCHEMISTRY				45	45			13454	13464		10.1021/bi061232z				NOV 14 2006	2006	A Ca2+ ion is an indispensable element in the oxygen-evolving Mn cluster in photosystem II (PSII). To investigate the structural relevance of Ca2+ to the Mn cluster, the effects of Sr2+ substitution for Ca2+ on the structures and reactions of ligands to the Mn cluster during the S-state cycle were investigated using flash-induced Fourier transform infrared ( FTIR) difference spectroscopy. FTIR difference spectra representing the four S-state transitions, S-1 -> S-2, S-2 -> S-3, S-3 -> S-0, and S-0 -> S-1, were recorded by applying four consecutive flashes either to PSII core complexes from Thermosynechococcus elongatus or to PSII-enriched membranes from spinach. The spectra were also recorded using biosynthetically Sr(2+)substituted PSII core complexes from T. elongatus and biochemically Sr2+-substituted PSII membranes from spinach. Several common spectral changes upon Sr2+ substitution were observed in the COO(-)stretching region of the flash-induced spectra for both preparations, which were best expressed in Ca2+-minus-Sr2+ double difference spectra. The significant intensity changes in the symmetric COO- peaks at similar to 1364 and similar to 1418 cm(-1) at the first flash were reversed as opposite intensity changes at the third flash, and the slight shift of the similar to 1446 cm-1 peak at the second flash corresponded to the similar but opposite shift at the fourth flash. Analyses of these changes suggest that there are at least three carboxylate ligands whose structures are significantly perturbed by Ca2+/Sr2+ exchange. They are (1) the carboxylate ligand having a bridging or unidentate structure in the S2 and S3 states and perturbed in the S-1 -> S-2 and S-3 -> S-0 transitions, (2) that with a chelating or bridging structure in the S1 and S0 states and perturbed also in the S-1 -> S-2 and S-3 -> S-0 transitions, and (3) that with a chelating structure in the S-3 and S-0 states and changes in the S-2 -> S-3 and S-0 -> S-1 transitions. Taking into account the recent FTIR studies using site-directed mutagenesis and/or isotope substitution [Chu et al. (2004) Biochemistry 43,3152- 3116; Kimura et al. (2005) J. Biol. Chem. 280, 2078-2083; Strickler et al. (2006) Biochemistry 45, 8801-8811], it was concluded that these carboxylate groups do not originate from either D1-Ala344 (C-terminus) or D1-Glu189, which are located near the Ca2+ ion in the X-ray crystallographic model of the Mn cluster. It was thus proposed that if the X-ray model is correct, the above carboxylate groups sensitive to Sr2+ substitution are ligands to the Mn ions strongly coupled to the Ca2+ ion rather than direct ligands to Ca2+.									47	0	0	0	37	0	47			0006-2960			WOS:000241808300006	17087499	
J	Gao, Jialong; Ishizaki, Shoichiro; Nagashima, Yuji								Molecular Cloning, Characterization, and Expression of a Catalase Gene in the Japanese Scallop Mizuhopecten yessoensis Induced in the Presence of Cadmium								OCEAN SCIENCE JOURNAL				51	2			223	233		10.1007/s12601-016-0019-7				MAR 2016	2016	Cadmium (Cd) is known to influence the oxidative status of marine organisms and can induce the formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Catalase (CAT) is one of the important enzymes involved in scavenging high levels of ROS. In present study, we cloned CAT cDNA and investigated the response of this enzyme at the transcriptional level in the Japanese scallop Mizuhopecten yessoensis exposed to Cd. The full-length CAT cDNA (MyCAT) of 1,870 nucleotides including a 57 bp 5'-UTR, a coding sequence of 1,500 bp and a 313 bp 3'-UTR were identified from the scallop. The deduced amino acid sequence of MyCAT corresponds to 499 amino acids with predicted molecular weight of 56.48 kDa and contains highly conserved motifs of the proximal heme-binding site RLFSYSTH, proximal active signature FNRERIPERVVHAKGGG and three catalytic amino acid residues His(72), Asn(145), and Tyr(355). Its significant homology to CATs from multiple alignments revealed that MyCAT had a high identity with CATs from other mollusks. CAT mRNA expression analysis revealed that expression level was highest in the digestive gland (p < 0.01) but weak in muscle. Following exposure to 200 and 400 mu g/ l of Cd, a high amount of Cd was found to have accumulated in the digestive gland and CAT mRNA expression had significantly increased in this organ among 7-day exposed scallops (p < 0.001). The result demonstrated that antioxidant enzymes such as CAT play important roles in counteracting Cd stress in M. yessoensis.									1	2	0	0	1	0	3			1738-5261	2005-7172		WOS:000378275200006

The photosynthetic or fluorescence parameters (except for the intercellular carbon dioxide concentration), chlorophyll content, RuBisCO content, and biomass of roots, stems, and leaves decreased at the seedling, jointing, and booting stages under the stress of DBP. Compared with the control, the content of superoxide anions and hydrogen peroxide in the roots, stems, and leaves increased with increasing DBP concentrations at the seedling, jointing, and booting stages. The activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT) in the roots, stems, and leaves increased under the 10 and 20 mg kg(-1) DBP treatments; however, no significant changes were observed under the 40 mg kg(-1) DBP treatment at the seedling stage (except for the SOD activity in roots). The increase in SOD and CAT activities in the roots, stems, and leaves with increasing DBP concentration at the jointing and booting stages suggested that an increase in the activities of these antioxidant enzymes may play an important role in defending against excess reactive oxygen species under DBP stress. The biomass of wheat roots, stems, and leaves decreased with an increase in DBP concentration, which was presumably caused by a decrease in photosynthesis and RuBisCO. The effect of DBP on wheat roots, stems, and leaves decreased with wheat growth. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Seventy-nine MYB transcription factors that were homologous to TasMYB36 from six sequenced Trichoderma genomes were analyzed. They were distributed in fourteen clades in the phylogenetic tree. The 79 MYBs contained 113 DNA binding domains, and their amino acid sequences were conserved and were different to those in plants. The promoters of 79 MYBs contained 1374 cis-regulators related to the stress response, such as GCR1 (17.5%) and GCN4 (15.5%). Subsequently, TasMYB36 was integrated into the genome of Populus davidiana x P. alba var. pyramidalis (PdPap poplar), and after co-culture of the transformants (PdPap-TasMYB36s) with Alternaria alternate, the transcription of genes in the jasmonic acid (JA) and salicylic acid (SA) hormone signaling pathways were upregulated; the POD, SOD and CAT activities were enhanced; and the reactive oxygen content was reduced in PdPap-TasMYB36s. The disease spots area on PdPap-TasMYB36s leaves infected by A. alternate were average 0.63% (PdPap-Con: 24.7%). In summary, TasMYB36 of T. asperellum CBS433.97 is an important defense response gene that upregulates other stress response genes and could improve resistance to biotic stresses.									5	0	0	0	5	0	5			2045-2322			WOS:000412654100005	28993676

(i) A non-linear model [J.H.M.Thornley (1976) Mathematical models in plant physiology, Academic Press, London; B. Marshall and P.V. Biscoe (1980) J Exp Bot 31:29-39] significantly better describes the photosynthetic light response curve [rate of photosynthesis (P) versus incident photosynthetic photon flux density (I)] than the frequently used linear hyperbolic model [E.I. Rabinowich (1951) Photosynthesis and related processes, vol 2, Wiley, New York]. (ii) When used at the recommended CO2 partial pressures (C-a = 1-5 kPa), CO2 supply saturates the photosynthesis rate in the C-3 dicot Phaseolus coccineus L. but not in the C-3 monocot Hordeum vulgare L.. (iii) Fits using a linear hyperbolic model for P versus I produce relatively large and statistically significant errors (approximate to 60%) in the estimation of P-max and quantum efficiency (a) if C, is not > 5 kPa. (iv) The convexity term, theta, incorporated into the non-linear models for P versus I appears to reflect the limitation placed on the carboxylation processes by the supply of CO2 to the chloroplast stroma. Therefore, the use of a non-linear model providing an estimate of theta should be encouraged, as it is likely to provide information on the physiological status of plants.									13	3	0	0	14	0	16			0032-0935			WOS:000172460900016	11762163

Interfaces in catalyst systems have long been considered the most critical factor in controlling catalytic reaction mechanisms. Interfaces include not only the catalyst surface but also interfaces within catalyst particles and those formed by constructing heterogeneous catalysts. The atomic and electronic structures of catalytic surfaces govern the kinetics of binding and release of reactant molecules from surface atoms. Interfaces within catalysts are introduced to enhance the intrinsic activity and stability of the catalyst by tuning the surface atomic and chemical structures. Examples include interfaces between the core and shell, twin or domain boundaries, or phase boundaries within single catalyst particles. In supported catalyst nanoparticles (NPs), the interface between the metallic NP and support serves as a critical tuning factor for enhancing catalytic activity. Surface electronic structure can be indirectly tuned and catalytically active sites can be increased through the use of supporting oxides. Tuning interfaces in catalyst systems has been identified as an important strategy in the design of novel catalysts. However, the governing principle of how interfaces contribute to catalyst behavior, especially in terms of interactions with intermediates and their stability during electrochemical operation, are largely unknown. This is mainly due to the evolving nature of such interfaces. Small changes in the structural and chemical configuration of these interfaces may result in altering the catalytic performance. These interfacial arrangements evolve continuously during synthesis, processing, use, and even static operation. A technique that can probe the local atomic and electronic interfacial structures with high precision while monitoring the dynamic interfacial behavior in situ is essential for elucidating the role of interfaces and providing deeper insight for fine-tuning and optimizing catalyst properties.Scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) has long been a primary characterization technique used for studying nanomaterials because of its exceptional imaging resolution and simultaneous chemical analysis. Over the past decade, advances in STEM, that is, the commercialization of both aberration correctors and monochromators, have significantly improved the spatial and energy resolution. Imaging atomic structures with subangstrom resolution and identifying chemical species with single-atom sensitivity are now routine for STEM. These advancements have greatly benefitted catalytic research. For example, the roles of lattice strain and surface elemental distribution and their effect on catalytic stability and reactivity have been well documented in bimetallic catalysts. In addition, three-dimensional atomic structures revealed by STEM tomography have been integrated in theoretical modeling for predictive catalyst NP design. Recent developments in stable electronic and mechanical devices have opened opportunities to monitor the evolution of catalysts in operando under synthesis and reaction conditions; high-speed direct electron detectors have achieved sub-millisecond time resolutions and allow for rapid structural and chemical changes to be captured. Investigations of catalysts using these latest microscopy techniques have provided new insights into atomic-level catalytic mechanisms. Further integration of new microscopy methods is expected to provide multidimensional descriptions of interfaces under relevant synthesis and reaction conditions.In this Account, we discuss recent insights on understanding catalyst activity, selectivity, and stability using advanced STEM techniques, with an emphasis on how critical interfaces dictate the performance of precious metal-based heterogeneous catalysts. The role of extended interfacial structures, including those between core and shell, between separate phases and twinned grains, between the catalyst surface and gas, and between metal and support are discussed. We also provide an outlook on how emerging electron microscopy techniques, such as vibrational spectroscopy and electron ptychography, will impact future catalysis research.									99	3	0	0	4	0	99			0001-4842	1520-4898		WOS:000399859800015	28207240	
J	Sun, Xianke; Ma, Ke; Li, Chang'e; Li, Wei								Formation of Fe-doped In2O3 nanowires and influence evolution of Fe ions on its photoluminescence property								JOURNAL OF ALLOYS AND COMPOUNDS				764				861	868		10.1016/j.jallcom.2018.06.137				OCT 5 2018	2018	In2O3 and Fe-doped In2O3 nanowires (NWs) were prepared on a Si substrate by using the CVD method. Structure analysis showed that the preparation of Fe-doped In2O3 NWs formed the body-centered cubic structure, which is nearly consistent with that of the In2O3. Importantly, the characteristic peak at (222) and (400) of Fe-doped In2O3 shifted to high angle, owing to the ionic radii of Fe3+ ions (0.79 angstrom) is much smaller than that of In3+ ions (0.94 angstrom). Morphology showed that the nanowires, with diameters of 100-150 nm and lengths of tens to hundreds of micrometers, grew along the [100] direction with spacing distance at 0.506 nm. Fluorescence test results showed that the spectral peak of Fe-doped In2O3 nanowires shifted to 419 and 438 nm, 3 nm blue-shifted compared with that of In(2)O(3 )NWs in 416 and 435 nm. Thanks to the assessment of the first-principle calculations by using density functional theory, the crystal structures of In(2)O(3)and Fe-doped In2O3 NWs have been designed. It can be found that the doped Fe3+ ions introduced the distortion of the crystal lattice and produced more oxygen vacancies in the crystal lattice, the total volume and valence charge is obviously decreasing from 128.46 to 105.51 and 88 to 78, respectively. Further research found that the doped Fe atoms lead to a smaller band gap, from 1.7 eV to around 0.7 eV, resulting in the blue shift of the PL spectrum. The distortion of the crystal lattice should be responsible for the decrease of the band gap of the In2O3 semiconductor. Thus, the formation of Fe-doped In2O3 NWs is facile and the assessment using first-principle calculations can offer a much deeper understanding of the influence of Fe ions on its photoluminescence property.

Spectrum synthesis utilizing latest Kurucz model atmospheres has been used to determine the B abundance for each star, with particular attention paid to the errors of each point, to permit judgment of the quality of the fit of models of Galactic chemical evolution. Previous observations were combined with new ones, bringing the number of stars analyzed to 11.A straight line of slope approximate to 1 gives an excellent fit to a plot(4) of log epsilon(B-LTE) versus [Fe/H], and if NLTE B abundances are used, the slope is approximate to 0.7. Plotting B versus [O/H] rather than [Fe/H] increases the slope of either plot by about 0.2. The observed relation suggests that the production of light elements such as B and Be is directly related to the production of heavier elements.Our data do not show a change in slope between halo and disk metallicities, but the number of stars near the disk-halo transition is small, and a modest change is not precluded. The NLTE B/Be ratio is typically approximate to 15 throughout the lifetime of the Galaxy, a ratio naturally produced by cosmic-ray (CR) spallation. Our data support a model in which most light-element production comes from low-energy CR spallation of C and O nuclei onto protons and alpha-particles, probably in the vicinity of massive supernovae in star-forming regions. Until recently, most models have emphasized light-element production in the general ISM from the spallation of high-energy protons and alpha-particles onto CNO nuclei. Especially during the Galaxy's early history, when the metallicity of the ISM was low, the spallation of protons and alpha-particles onto CNO nuclei cannot account for as much B as we observe, unless the CR flux was sufficiently high for compensation. The observed relation also constrains any direct production of B by the nu-process in supernovae to be at most a small part of total B production.It is possible that the gamma rays recently detected from the Orion Nebula region are the signature of spallation by energetic C and O nuclei. Nevertheless, B, Be, and Fe data alone give the strongest evidence of the importance of spallation by C and O for producing light elements.									112	0	0	0	0	0	112			0004-637X			WOS:A1997YB99100033

The pattern of the release of the four protons from the CC cannot be followed directly in the medium, because proton release from unknown amino acid residues also takes place. However, pH-independent net charge oscillations of 0:0:1:1 in S-0:S-1:S-2:S-3 have been considered as an intrinsic indicator for the H+ release from the CC. The net charges have been proposed to be created as the charge difference between electron abstraction and H+ release from the CC. Then the H+ release from the CC is 1:0:1:2 for the S-0 --> S-1 --> S-2 --> S-3 --> S-0 transition. Strong support for this conclusion is given in this work with the analysis of the pH-dependent pattern of H+ release in the medium measured directly by a glass electrode between pH 5.5 and 7.2. Improved and crystallizable photosystem II core complexes from the cyanobacterium Synechococcus elongatus were used as material. The pattern can be explained by protons released from the CC with a stoichiometry of 1:0:1:2 and protons from an amino acid group (pK approximate to 5.7) that is deprotonated and reprotonated through electrostatic interaction with the oscillating net charges 0:0:1:1 in S-0:S-1:S-2:S-3. Possible water derivatives that circulate through the S states have been named.									125	0	1	0	83	0	128			0021-9258	1083-351X		WOS:000083276700011	10521415	
J	Ouyang, Guang; She, Zhenbing; Papineau, Dominic; Wang, Xiangfa; Luo, Genming; Li, Chao								Dynamic carbon and sulfur cycling in the aftermath of the Lomagundi-Jatuli Event: Evidence from the Paleoproterozoic Hutuo Supergroup, North China Craton								PRECAMBRIAN RESEARCH				337						105549	10.1016/j.precamres.2019.105549				FEB 2020	2020	The unprecedented positive delta C-13 excursion in carbonates deposited between 2.2 and 2.0 Ga, known as the Lomagundi-Jatuli Event (LJE), has been documented globally and linked to the rise of atmospheric oxygen. Increasing oxidation inevitably changed the atmosphere-hydrosphere system, but few chemostratigraphic or quantitative constraints for the aftermath of this event exists. Here, we describe a similar to 200 m-thick carbonate succession in the Huaiyincun Formation, Hutuo Supergroup, similar to 2.0-1.9 Ga, from the North China Craton. There is a lithological transition from pink-purple dolostones to grey dolostones at ca. 91.6 m above the base of the Huaiyincun Formation. The former are more enriched in hematite and detrital minerals, whereas the latter contain more organic matter but almost no detrital phases. Meanwhile, the frequent occurrence of tempesite structures, along with the abrupt decline of stromatolites in the upper Huaiyincun Formation, suggest a storm dominated environment. These distinct features within the Huaiyincun Formation reveal increased water depth during a transgression event. Two types of Raman spectra of organic matter were found in the lower and upper Huaiyincun Formation, respectively, which is proposed to be the result of variable oxidation.At 65.6 m, 26 m below the lithological transition (similar to 91.6 m), remarkable decreases in both delta C-33(carb), and delta S-34(CAS) are observed. This discordance between C-S isotopic excursions and sedimentological and mineralogical variations argues against a seawater depth gradient effect of the delta C-13(carb) and delta S-34(CAS) curves. Instead, the decline of delta C-13(carb) rather correlates with the negative delta C-13(carb), excursions in ca. 2.0 Ga carbonates from Gabon and Russia, known as the Shunga-Francevillian Event (SFE). The result of the quantitatively constrained paleoseawater [SO42-](sw) suggests a crash of the seawater sulfate reservoir compared with that during the preceding LIE. However, the decreased 834SCAs and increased CAS concentration towards the top of the study unit represent the recovery of seawater sulfate reservoir. The coordinated decline in delta S-34(CAS) and delta C-13(carb), values is likely related to enhanced oxidation of continental pyrite and organic matter in the aftermath of the LJE. The Huaiyincun Formation therefore represents a critical interval that recorded dynamic carbon and sulfur cycles after the LIE.									5	0	0	0	1	0	5			0301-9268	1872-7433		WOS:000510527900021

Natural photosystem II in the plants uses these resources in ecofriendly manner for the production of atmospheric oxygen and energy. Inspired by this natural process, the development of artificial catalytic system to facilitate the solar-induced water splitting for the continuous production of hydrogen is the holy grail of the chemist and energy experts to meet the future energy demand at minimal environmental cost. Despite considerable research efforts dedicated to this area in the last decade, the development of highly efficient, stable and economic photocatalysts remain a challenging task for the large scale H-2 production from water. Polyoxometalates (POMs)-based materials are emerging photo/photoelectrocatalysts in this quest owing to their multi-electron redox potential and fast reversible charge transfer properties, which are the essential requirements of photo-assisted water splitting catalysis. They are generally soluble in aqueous medium and thus their inherent catalytic/co-catalytic properties can be better exploited by incorporating/immobilizing them over suitable support materials. Therefore, exploration of discrete POM units over the support materials possessing high surface area, functionalizable architecture, flexible pore size and good light harvesting ability is an attractive area of research that has resulted in the generation of a strong library of heterocatalysts. The underlying support not only offers stability and recyclability attributes to the POM units but also provides decent dispersion, easy/maximum accessibility to the active sites, enhanced absorption capability, and synergistically enhances the activity by transfer of electrons and efficient charge/carriers separation by creating POM-support junctions. This mini-review emphasizes on the strategies for the incorporation of POMs on various porous supports like metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), covalent-organic frameworks (COFs), oxide-based semiconductors, carbonaceous materials, etc., and their applications as effective photo/photoelectrocatalysts for water splitting. In addition, the mechanistic study, comparative analysis and the future potential of these novel nanoscale materials is also highlighted. We believe that this review article will provide a new direction and scientific interest at the boundary of materials engineering, and solar-driven chemistry for the sustainable energy conversion/storage processes.									6	1	0	0	0	0	7			2192-8606	2192-8614		WOS:000642383400001

The geochemistry of authigenic carbonates from accretionary prisms can serve as proxies for conditions during carbonate cementation and resultant lithification. We report results from the Nankai accretionary prism recovered from Integrated Ocean Drilling Program (IODP) sites C0011 and C0012 and we document continued cementation of deep sediment sections prior to subduction. Elemental and isotope data provide evidence for complex mixing of different isotopic reservoirs in pore waters contributing to carbonate chemical signatures. Carbon stable isotope values exhibit a broad range (delta C-13(V-PDB) = + 0.1% to -22.5%) that corresponds to different stages of cement formation during burial. Carbonate formation temperatures from carbonate-clumped isotope geochemistry range from 16 degrees C to 63 degrees C at Site C0011 and 8.7 degrees C to 68 degrees C at Site C0012. The correspondence between the clumped-isotope temperatures and extrapolations of measured in situ temperatures indicate the carbonate is continuing to form at present. Calculated water isotopic compositions are in some cases enriched in O-18 relative to measured interstitial waters suggesting a component of inherited seawater or input from clay-bound water. Low oxygen isotope values and the observed Ba/Ca ratios are also consistent with carbonate cementation at depth. Strontium isotopes of interstitial waters (Sr-87/Sr-86 of 0.7059-0.7069) and carbonates (Sr-87/Sr-86 of 0.70715-0.70891) support formation of carbonates from a mixture of strontium reservoirs including current interstitial waters and relic seawater contemporaneous with deposition. Collectively our data reflect mixed sources of dissolved inorganic carbon and cations that include authigenic phases driven by organic carbon and volcanic alteration reactions. Physical properties of input sediments continue to undergo modification by carbonate cementation at present. Due to ongoing recrystallization, temperatures from carbonate-clumped isotopes reflect the modern geothermal gradient and may serve as useful measures of geothermal gradients in other siliciclastic basins where carbonate cementation occurs. We conclude that clumped-isotope signatures in authigenic carbonates from accretionary prisms are important proxies for the timing and conditions of cementation in active margins. Our results highlight the importance of using multi-proxy approaches to elucidate the history of carbonate cementation, particularly to establish carbonate precipitation at depth and its potential impact on the physical and mechanical properties of the sediment prior to subduction.

The superoxide dismutases (SODs) are essential enzymes of defense against the oxidative damage caused by water stress. Here, we cloned and characterized cDNAs of the SOD gene family in the resurrection plant Haberlea rhodopensis. Seven full-length cDNAs, and their partial genomic clones, were obtained by combination of degenerate PCR, RT-PCR and RACE. The derived amino acid sequences exhibited a very high degree of similarity to cytosolic Cu,Zn-SODs (HrCSD2, HrCSD3), chloroplastic Cu,Zn-SODs (HrCSD5), other Cu,Zn-SODs (HrCSD4), Mn-SODs (HrMSD) and Fe-SODs (HrFSD). One cDNA turned out to be a pseudogene (HrCSD1). All identified SOD genes were found expressed at transcriptional level the HrCSD2, HrCSD5, HrMSD and HrFSD were constitutively expressed in all organs, while the HrCSD3 and HrCSD4 were organ-specific. The transcripts of the housekeeping SOD genes were detected at significant levels even in air-dry leaves. The multigene SOD family of H. rhodopensis is the first studied SOD family amongst resurrection plant species. Our finding of well expressed SOD transcripts in fully dehydrated leaves correlates with retention of SOD activity, and with the ability of H. rhodopensis to revive upon rehydration. Because of the endemic relict nature of that species, our findings may help to further elucidate the evolutionary relationships among different SOD isoforms from distinct plant species.

The Os-CHLH rice mutant, which lacks chlorophyll in the thylakoids, was isolated by T-DNA gene trapping (Jung, K.-H., Hur, J., Ryu, C.-H., Choi, Y., Chung, Y.-Y., Miyao, A., Hirochika, H., and An, G. (2003) Plant Cell Physiol. 44, 463-472). The OsCHLH mutant is unable to fix CO2 and exhibits reduced growth. Wild type and mutant plants exhibit similar rates of respiratory O-2 uptake in the dark, whereas the rate of photosynthetic O-2 evolution by the mutant was negligible during illumination. During dark respiration the wild type and mutant exhibited similar levels of cytoplasmic ATP. In the mutant oligomycin treatment (an inhibitor of mitochondrial F1F0-ATPase) drastically reduced ATP production. The fact that this was reversed by the addition of glucose suggested that the mutant produced ATP exclusively from mitochondria but not from chloroplasts. In whole cell patch clamp experiments, the activity of outward-rectifying K+ channels of rice mesophyll cells showed ATP-dependent currents, which were 1.5-fold greater in wild type than in mutant cells. Channels in both wild type and mutant cells were deactivated by the removal of cytosolic ATP, whereas in the presence of ATP the channels remained active. We conclude that mesophyll cells in the OsCHLH rice mutant derive ATP from mitochondrial respiration, and that this is critical for the normal function of plasma membrane outward-rectifying K+ channels.									22	3	1	0	24	0	28			0021-9258	1083-351X		WOS:000188969200082	14660680

Oxidative stress and inflammation play important roles in the evolution of those major pathological symptoms. Jatrorrhizine (JAT), a main component of a traditional Chinese herbal, coptidis rhizome, has been shown to have neuroprotective effects and we previously showed that it is also able to clear oxygen free radicals and reduce inflammatory responses. In this study, we demonstrated that JAT administration could alleviate the learning and memory deficits in AD. Furthermore, we also found that JAT treatment reduced the levels of A beta plaques in the cortex and hippocampus of APP/PS1 double-transgenic mice. Other studies suggest that there are gut microbiome alterations in AD. In order to explore the underlying mechanisms between gut microbiota and AD, DNA sequencing for 16s rDNA V3-V4 was performed in fecal samples from APP/PS1 transgenic mice and C57BL/6 wild-type (WT) mice. Our results indicated that APP/PS1 mice showed less Operational Taxonomic Units (OTUs) abundance in gut microbiota than WT mice and with different composition. Furthermore, JAT treatment enriched OTUs abundance and alpha diversity in APP/PS1 mice compared to WT mice. High dose of JAT treatment altered the abundance of some specific gut microbiota such as the most predominant phylum Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes in APP/PS1 mice. In conclusion, APP/PS1 mice display gut dysbiosis, and JAT treatment not only improved the memory deficits, but also regulated the abundance of the microbiota. This may provide a therapeutic way to balance the gut dysbiosis in AD patients.									16	4	0	0	11	1	20			2045-2322			WOS:000508872700021	31862965

On the addition of Ca2+, obelin generates a blue bioluminescence emission (lambda(max) = 485 nm) as the result of the oxidative decarboxylation of the bound substrate, coelenterazine. The W92F obelin mutant is noteworthy because of the unusually high speed with which it responds to sudden changes of [Ca2+] and because it emits violet light rather than blue due to a prominent band with lambda(max) = 405 nm. Increase of pH in the range from 5.5 to 8.5 and using D2O both diminish the contribution of the 405 nm band, indicating that excited state proton transfer is involved. Fluorescence model studies have suggested the origin of the 485 nm emission as the excited state of an anion of coelenteramide, the bioluminescence reaction product, and 405 nm from the excited neutral state. Assuming that the dimensions of the substrate binding cavity do not change during the excited state formation, a His22 residue within hydrogen bonding distance to the 6-(p-hydroxy)-phenyl group of the excited coelenteramide is a likely candidate for accepting the phenol proton to produce an ion-pair excited state, in support of recent suggestions for the bioluminescence emitting state. The proton transfer could be impeded by removal of the Trp92 H-bond, resulting in strong enhancement of a 405 nm band giving the violet color of bioluminescence. Comparative analysis of 3D structures of the wild-type (WT) and W92F obelins reveals that there are structural displacements of certain key Ca2+-ligating residues in the loops of the two C-terminal EF hands as well as clear differences in hydrogen bond networks in W92F. For instance, the hydrogen bond between the side-chain oxygen atom of Asp 169 and the main-chain nitrogen of Arg112 binds together the incoming alpha-helix of loop III and the exiting cc-helix of loop IV in WT, providing probably concerted changes in these EF hands on calcium binding. But this linkage is not found in W92F obelin. These differences apparently do not change the overall affinity to calcium of W92F obelin but may account for the kinetic differences between the WT and mutant obelins. From analysis of the hydrogen bond network in the coelenterazine binding cavity, it is proposed that the trigger for bioluminescence reaction in these Ca2+-regulated photoproteins may be a shift of the hydrogen bond donor-acceptor separations around the coelenterazine-2-hydroperoxy substrate, initiated by small spatial adjustment of the exiting a-helix of loop IV.									54	1	2	0	48	0	57			0006-2960			WOS:000183024200006	12755603

We aim to describe the prevalence and features of anosmia and dysgeusia in COVID-19 patients.Methods: We retrospectively investigated the clinical features of confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Nord Franche-Comte Hospital, Trevenans, France, between March, 1st and March, 14th 2020. We used SARS-CoV-2 real-time RT-PCR in respiratory samples to confirm the cases.Results: Of the 70 patients enrolled, the mean age was 57.0 years, and 29 patients (41%) were men. Median Charlson comorbidity index was 1.70 (+/- 2.5). Twenty-seven (39%) patients had pneumonia. Fatigue (93% [65]), cough (80%[55]), and fever (77%[54]) were the three main symptoms. Neurologic symptoms were present in more than half of the patients: anosmia (53%[37]) and dysgeusia (48%[34]). The mean duration of anosmia was 7.4 (+/- 5, [1-21]) days, and 51% (36/70) of patients recovered before 28 days of evolution. Only one patient with anosmia had not recovered at the end of the follow-up. Patients with anosmia had pneumonia less often (10/37 vs 17/33, p = 0.036), were hospitalized less often (13/37 vs 20/33, p = 0.033), and needed oxygen therapy less often (6/37 vs 17/33, p = 0.002) than patients without anosmia. There were no statistically significant differences for viral load between patients with anosmia and patients without anosmia (5.5 [2.0-8.6] vs 5.3 [2.1-8.5] log copies/mL respectively, p = 0.670). The fatality of COVID-19 in our study was 6%, with four deaths.Conclusions: Anosmia and dysgeusia are present in half of COVID-19 patients. The mean duration of anosmia was 7 days, and the outcome seems favorable in less than 28 days. (C) 2020 The Author(s).

J	Meyer, BS; Krishnan, TD; Clayton, DD								Ca-48 production in matter expanding from high temperature and density								ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL				462	2			825	838		10.1086/177197				MAY 10 1996	1996	We calculate with a large nuclear reaction network the nuclear dynamics associated with the expansions and cooling of initially hot and dense matter. We study matter with neutron excess near that of Ca-48, because one objective is to clarify the nucleosynthesis of that abundant neutron-rich nucleus, whose origin has been enigmatic. Expecting that supernovae provide the site of its origin, we take initial temperatures near T-9 = 10 but survey a wide range of initial densities, corresponding to a wide range in initial entropies. The highest entropies are probably associated with winds from newborn neutron stars in Type II collapse events, whereas the smallest entropies are probably associated with very high density Type Ia cores. Our survey objective is the analysis of the dynamics of the nuclear assembly as it cools, and how the correct description of it depends on the specific entropy.We show that resultant abundances of neutron-rich nuclei are very poorly represented by nuclear statistical equilibrium (NSE). The deviations from NSE are governed by the number of heavy nuclei assembled during the expansion, which differs significantly from the number demanded by NSE at both high and low entropy. High-entropy expansions are shown to contain too few nuclei, with the result that Ca-48 cannot survive the expansion even though it would be expected to be abundant using NSE guidelines. Low-entropy expansions contain too many nuclei with respect to that guideline, with the result that Ca-48 is more abundant than expected. In this case it is especially significant that the ratio of Ca-48 to other major neutron-rich nuclei (e.g., Zn-66, Se-82) is substantially greater than NSE guidelines, which ameliorates overproduction limits from the latter. We show, furthermore, that the Ca-48 nucleus itself plays a key role in the nuclear dynamics. In the low-entropy expansion, which is the one to which we must look for Ca-48 origin, abundant Ca-48 is a refractory post, a local abundance maximum, with quasi-equilibria attached to it in both the upward-mass direction (setting their abundances) and in the downward-mass direction (setting the disintegration rate of Ca-48, which governs the attempt to relax to NSE).Although understanding the network is our key result, we discuss some immediate consequences of astrophysical importance. We argue that Type Ia cores must be the site of origin of Ca-48, and track one dense explosion of an oxygen-neon core to show that it adjusts its neutron richness during the burning to values similar to those in our survey (eta = 0.17) and that the network dynamics are identical to those identified in our survey. We also discuss significant implications for the correlated endemic isotopic anomalies in neutron-rich isotopes discovered in calcium-aluminum-rich inclusions from meteorites.									76	3	0	0	1	0	79			0004-637X			WOS:A1996UH18700025

The presence and concentration of the Fe impurities in the three electrolytes is determined by Inductive Coupled Plasma spectroscopy. The rationale for investigating the OER performance of the pure and mixed Ni/Fe catalysts in various NaOH solutions, rather than the widely reported and more expensive KOH, with different Fe impurities was to conclude if the OER activity was comparable to the KOH and if the activity differed between NaOH solutions. A number of the mixed Ni/Fe catalysts in NaOH containing Fe impurities at a concentration of 5 ppb exhibited higher OER activities, with higher Turnover Frequency than the same catalyst in the NaOH solutions containing <1 ppb and 102 ppb and the state if the art RuO2. These Ni/Fe oxide materials are also cheaper to produce than the aforementioned platinum group materials therefore rendering these Ni/Fe catalysts more practical and economical. All of the material/electrolyte combinations are also evaluated with respect to their Tafel slopes and measured overpotential at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2). To determine the Ni and Fe species formed before and after OER ex-situ Raman spectroscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy are utilised. Interestingly, the oxidation state of the Ni species in the pure Ni material does not change during OER in any of the NaOH media. While for the pure Fe and mixed Ni/Fe 50/50 material, the oxidation states of the species vary with the concentration of Fe impurities in the NaOH solution.									41	1	0	0	3	0	41			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000379965800027

The combination of metal and metal oxide with carbon is an effective strategy to achieve active bimetallic nanocatalysts. Herein, we developed a facile method to synthesize CoxMn1-xO@GC and Co/MnO@GC nanocomposites by an in situ conversion of Co-Mn PBAs. The as-prepared carbon hybrids, especially the resulting Co/MnO@GC carbonized under 700 degrees C (Co/MnO@GC-700), preserve the nanocubic morphology of Co-Mn PBAs and show excellent supercapacitance and OER performance. Specifically, an outstanding specific capacitance of 2275 F g(-1) can be obtained with Co/MnO@GC-700 as the electrode material at a current density of 4 A g(-1). When used as OER catalysts, Co/MnO@GC-700 shows a low overpotential of only 358 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) in 1 M KOH. Moreover, a fabricated asymmetric supercapacitor device (ASC device), in combination with active carbon, shows a high cell voltage of 1.7 V and a considerably high specific capacitance of 246 F g(-1) at 2 A g(-1). Our nanoarchitecture design derived from PBAs provides a new opportunity for future applications in high-performance energy storage and transformation systems.									36	2	0	0	0	0	36			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000439319000045	29989638

Among them, alkaline electrolyte membrane based water electrolysis (AEMWE) has an advantage in the aspect of material costs, e.g. from non-noble catalysts and membrane, but suffers from lower performance compared to proton exchange membrane based water electrolysis (PEMWE). However, there are fewer researches on single cell MEA and operation study compared to material research to enhance AEMWE performance. Here, we analyze the effect of the cell construction and operation factors, i.e MEA pressing, torque of cell assembly, electrolyte pre-feed methods, and operation temperature, to obtain high performance in AEMWE single cell operation. 97.5 % current improves at 1.8 V by applying optimized torque. 94 % decrease of ohmic resistance are achieved from electrolyte pre-feeding. 50 mA cm(-2) of current density is enhanced at 0.591 V of overvoltage per 10 degrees C temperature increase due to higher ionic conductivity and reaction kinetics. These factors significantly affect internal factors such as not only material property during operation but also, catalysts structure and contact in MEA, leading 4.3 times progress of current density from 0.242 to 1.045 A cm(-2) at 1.8 V-cell.

Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) gene insertion(I)/deletion(D) polymorphism is one of the genetic factor found to be related with CAD. We investigated the association between I/D polymorphism of the ACE gene and the presence of CAD. Threehundred and seven patients (187 males and 120 females, aged between 3580, mean 54.3 +/- 9.8 years) who underwent diagnostic coronary angiography were included in the study. ACE I/D polymorphism was detected by polymerase chain reaction. Of the 307, 176 had CAD. The most frequently observed genotype in all subjects was ID (47.9%). However, in patients with CAD the frequency of 11 genotype was lower whereas DD genotype was higher compared to the controls (p < 0.05). The number of D allele carrying subjects were also higher (p < 0.05) in CAD patients. The logistic regression analysis indicated that the ACE D allele is an independent risk factor (odds ratio = 1.48, 95% CI = 1.01-2.18, p < 0.05). In conclusion, the I/D polymorphism of ACE gene (carrying D allele) is an independent risk factor for CAD in the studied Turkish population.									27	1	0	0	12	1	29			1225-8687			WOS:000230910100016	16053717

Here, we report the synthesis of SiO2-encompassed Co@N-doped porous carbon assemblies as a new type of recyclable catalyst for the purpose by calcination of zeolitic imidazolate framework-67@SiO2 microtubes at high temperatures under an N-2 atmosphere. We find that the surface layer of SiO2 in the precursor microtubes is essential for the production of efficient catalysts by supplying an additional surface for Co nanoparticle dispersion in an effort to reduce their size. In addition, the SiO2 layer renders a highly ordered arrangement of Co@N-doped porous carbon within the catalysts, possibly allowing the ease of mass transfer of ammonia borane within the catalysts. The optimized catalysts obtained via calcination at 800 degrees C show a set of remarkable catalytic benefits, including a high hydrogen generation rate of 8.4 mol min(-1) mol((co))(-1), a relatively low activation energy of 36.1 kJ mol(-1), and a remarkable reusability (at least 10 times). Our results can provide new insight into the design and synthesis of highly ordered SiO2 supported catalysts for different reactions.									30	1	0	0	2	0	30			0743-7463			WOS:000456749400009	30607962

A very promising approach is to mimic the water splitting process that occurs in plants during photosynthesis, in order to convert solar energy into chemical energy. A successful water splitting reaction, which comprises two half reactions (water oxidation and the reduction of protons), can generate H-2 and O-2 from water. Hydrogen is a promising renewable energy carrier because of its clean combustion and high calorific value. Light-driven water splitting is considered to be a feasible way to transform water and solar energy into hydrogen energy. However, water oxidation is considered to be the bottleneck process of water splitting because it advances in a thermodynamically uphill manner with the involvement of 4e(-) and 4H(+). Inspired by the nature of Mn4CaO5 in photosystem II (PS II), the comprehensive understanding of its key features for use in active molecular water oxidation catalysts (WOCs) remains challenging. Extensive effort has been devoted to researching and manufacturing the structure and biomimicking the catalytic activity of Mn4CaO5 clusters that contain the Mn3CaO4 cubane structure, for the construction of low-cost and robust WOCs. WOCs can be divided into heterogeneous and homogeneous catalysts. Although heterogeneous WOCs are convenient for recycling and are easily prepared on a large scale, homogeneous WOCs, especially complexes based on organic ligands or polyoxometalates (POMs), have more advantages owing to their catalytic efficiency, structural modifications, and mechanistic understanding. Thus, recently, some molecules with an M4O4 (M = transition metals, mainly Mn, Co, Ni, and Cu) cubic structure have been reportedly used as photocatalytic WOCs. In this review, we present an overview of the most important and recent advances based on M4O4 cubic WOCs that contain first-row transition metal cubanes for visible light-driven water oxidation. Our main focus is on the structure of cubane catalysts, including metal complexes, POMs, and a system containing BiVO4 or polymeric carbon nitride (PCN) as a photosensitizer, and cubic complexes as WOCs. Results have shown that the activity and stability of the catalyst can be tuned by the ligand stability, metal center, coordination environment, and other factors. This review will be helpful for designing new cubane catalysts for photocatalytic water oxidation that are highly efficient and stable.									22	7	0	0	2	0	22			1000-6818			WOS:000501224400006

In this photoanode, the wrinkle-like ZnFe2O4 nanosheets (NSs) are grown onto ZnO nanotube arrays through adsorption and annealing reaction. The hierarchical ZnO/ZnFe2O4 nanotube array photoanode exhibits outstanding PEC water splitting to produce hydrogen due to the remarkable visible-light harvesting ability and the large surface area of wrinkle-like ZnFe2O4 NSs. Under simulated solar light irradiation, the hierarchical ZnO/ZnFe2O4 nanotube arrays (NTAs) achieve a remarkably enhanced photocurrent density of 1.3 mA/cm(2), which is 2.2-fold higher than that of pristine ZnO NTAs at 0 V vs Ag/AgCI. Moreover, the hydrogen production rate of the hierarchical ZnO/ZnFe2O4 nanotube array photoanode is 3.6-fold higher than that of pristine ZnO nanotube array photoelectrode at 0.6 V vs Ag/AgCl.

J	Rubie, DC; Melosh, HJ; Reid, JE; Liebske, C; Righter, K					Righter, Kevin/0000-0002-6075-7908			Mechanisms of metal-silicate equilibration in the terrestrial magma ocean								EARTH AND PLANETARY SCIENCE LETTERS				205	3-4			239	255	PII S0012-821X(02)01044-0	10.1016/S0012-821X(02)01044-0				JAN 10 2003	2003	It has been proposed that the high concentrations of moderately siderophile elements (e.g. Ni and Cc) in the Earth's mantle are the result of metal-silicate equilibration at the base of a deep magma ocean that formed during Earth's accretion. According to this model, liquid metal ponds at the base of the magma ocean and, after equilibrating chemically with the overlying silicate liquid at high pressure (e.g. 25-30 GPa), descends further as large diapirs to form the core. Here we investigate the kinetics of metal-silicate equilibration in order to test this model and place new constraints on processes of core formation. We investigate two models: (1) Reaction between a layer of segregated liquid metal and overlying silicate liquid at the base of a convecting magma ocean, as described above. (2) Reaction between dispersed metal droplets and silicate liquid in a magma ocean. In the liquid-metal layer model, the convection velocity of the magma ocean controls both the equilibration rate and the rate at which the magma ocean cools. Results indicate that time scales of chemical equilibration are two to three orders of magnitude longer than the time scales of cooling and crystallization of the magma ocean. In the falling metal droplet model, the droplet size and settling velocity are critical parameters that we determine from fluid dynamics. For likely silicate liquid viscosities, the stable droplet diameter is estimated to be similar to1 cm and the settling velocity similar to0.5 m/s. Using such parameters, liquid metal droplets are predicted to equilibrate chemically after falling a distance of <200 m in a magma ocean. The models indicate that the concentrations of moderately siderophile elements in the mantle could be the result of chemical interaction between settling metal droplets and silicate liquid in a magma ocean but not between a segregated layer of liquid metal and overlying silicate liquid at the base of the magma ocean. Finally, due to fractionation effects, the depth of the magma ocean could have been significantly different from the value suggested by the apparent equilibration pressure.

The NFs are conformally decorated with a thin FeOOH cocatalyst layer. Photoelectrochemical (PEC) measurements show that this photoanode, incorporating alpha-Fe2O3/ FeOOH NFs rooted on the Au/Fe structure, exhibits significantly enhanced PEC water oxidation performance compared to the plain alpha-Fe2O3 nanostructure on the Fe substrate. The a-Fe2O3/ FeOOH NFs on Au/Fe photoanode yields a photocurrent density of 3.1 mA cm(-2) a remarkably low onset potential of 0.5- 0.6 V-RHE in 1m KOH under AM 1.5G (00 mWcm(-2)) simulated sunlight illumination. The enhancement in PEC performance can be attributed to a synergistic effect of the FeOOH top decoration and the Au underlayer, whereby FeOOH facilitates hole transfer at the interface of electrode/electrolyte and the Au layer provides a sink for the electron transport to the back contact. This results in a drastically improved charge-separation efficiency in the single crystalline alpha-Fe2O3 NF photoanode.									50	2	0	0	4	0	51			1864-5631	1864-564X		WOS:000405080200004	28437588

Four new particle formation event days and a typical non-event day were selected for our analysis. Atmospheric sulphuric acid, the important precursor vapor in nucleation and growth, were simulated with a pseudo steady-state model based on the measurements of SO2, NOx, O-3; CO, non-methane hydrocarbon (NMHC) and ambient particle number concentrations as well as modeled photolysis frequencies obtained from measurements. The maximum midday sulphuric acid concentrations vary from 4.53 x 10(7) to 2.17 x 10(8) molecules cm(-3), the corresponding source rate via reaction of OH and SO2 range between 2.37 x 10(6) and 1.16 x 10(7) molecules cm(-3) s(-1). Nucleation mode growth rate was derived from size spectral evolution during the events to be 6:8-13.8 nm h(-1). Based on the growth rate, concentration of the vapors participating in subsequent growth were estimated to vary from 1.32 x 10(8) to 2.80 x 10(8) molecules cm(-3) with corresponding source rate between 7.26 x 10(6) and 1.64 x 10(7) molecules cm(-3) s(-1). Our results show the degree of pollution is larger in PRD. Sulphuric acid concentrations are fairly high and have a close correlation with new particle formation events. Budget analysis shows that sulphuric acid alone is not enough for required growth; other nonvolatile vapors are needed. However, sulphuric acid plays an important role in growth; the contribution of sulphuric acid to growth in PRD is 12.4%-65.2%.									16	5	0	0	11	0	18			0256-1530	1861-9533		WOS:000255723900010

In the Early Cretaceous, hydrocarbon and basinal water expulsion took place from the oil source rocks (Los Molles Formation) into the reservoir rocks Lajas Formation (Middle Jurassic), after the formation of diagenetic quartz overgrowths. Marcasite, pyrite and illite + illite-smectite mixed layer minerals then formed together with hydrocarbons. Marcasite (delta S-34 -3.5 and -2.2 parts per thousand) and pyrite (delta S-34 -11.6 to 18.1 parts per thousand) precipitated via bacterial sulfate reduction from fluids showing temperatures <80 degrees C and fluctuating pH conditions. During the Paleogene, Andean tectonism triggered migration of oxidized basinal brine containing dissolved leached Zn and Pb from the Los Molles Formation source rocks and S from the evaporites of the basin. This brine entered in the hydrocarbon reservoir of the Lajas Formation, resulting in the precipitation of sphalerite (delta S-34 +10.4 to +10.8 parts per thousand) and galena (delta S-34 +5.2 parts per thousand) by TSR at temperatures of 119-123 degrees C together with siderite. The Andean orogeny may also have triggered the migration of hydrocarbons + brines from the shallowest source rocks (Vaca Muerta Formation) and reservoir rocks (Mulichinco, Lajas and Lotena formations) into the red beds of the upper Cretaceous Neuqu ' en Group, which became bleached as a result. Marcasite (delta S-34 -36.4 to 18.2 parts per thousand) and pyrite (delta S-34 -60.2 to -24 parts per thousand) precipitated by BSR, while calcite (delta C-13 -12.3 to -5.6 parts per thousand) formed due to redox reactions accompanying formation of quartz overgrowths, clay mineral coatings (delta D -92.4 parts per thousand to -82.8 parts per thousand and delta O-18 16.2 parts per thousand to 18.40 parts per thousand), and barite (delta S-34 -5.9 parts per thousand). Quartz overgrowths and barite precipitated from brines (1.5-10 wt% NaCl equiv.) at temperatures of 91-120 degrees C, with barite precipitating close to the feeder zones. Calcite cements are more widespread and generated from several pulses of brine and hydrocarbons up flow, evidenced by the wide range of homogenization temperatures (100-185 degrees C) and diversity of UV fluorescence colors of hydrocarbon-rich fluid inclusions. In subsequent Miocene tectonic events, basinal brines were able to leach Cu from the underlying thick red beds of the basin, entering the Neuqu ' en Group oil reservoir traps or carrier beds where they became reduced. Chalcopyrite and bornite precipitated at temperatures >100 degrees C close to the feeder zones at the expense of barite as a local sulfur source. Chalcocite group minerals (delta S-34 -21.3 parts per thousand to -7.3 parts per thousand) precipitated outwards in pore spaces of the sandstones at lower temperatures (<100 degrees C) through BSR of sulfate in the mineralizing brines. Final exhumation of the Neuquen Group (Upper Miocene-Pliocene) promoted the infiltration of the meteoric water, the oxidation of the sulfides and formation of supergene Fe-Cu, V and U minerals.Isotope geochemistry and fluid inclusion results combined with alteration and ore mineralogy document the processes controlling the distribution of base metals in the Huincul High region that can be applied to evaluate the metal potential in other areas of the Neuquen Basin and further extrapolated to similar geological systems elsewhere.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			0375-6742	1879-1689		WOS:000663094200004

High resolution (R similar to 50,000) and high signal-to-noise spectra obtained with the CRIRES spectrograph and the VLT telescope or from the NOAO archive (for TX Psc) have been used. Our abundance analysis uses the latest generation of MARCS model atmospheres for cool carbon-rich stars. Using spectral synthesis in local thermodynamic equilibrium, we derive for these stars fluorine abundances that are systematically lower by similar to 0.8 dex in average with respect to the sole previous estimates by Jorissen et al. The possible reasons of this discrepancy are explored. We conclude that the difference may rely on the blending with C-bearing molecules (CN and C-2) that were not properly taken into account in the former study. The new F abundances are in better agreement with the prediction of full network stellar models of low-mass AGB stars. These models also reproduce the s-process elements distribution in the sampled stars. This result, if confirmed in a larger sample of AGB stars, might alleviate the current difficulty to explain the largest [F/O] ratios found by Jorissen et al. In particular, it may not be necessary to search for alternative nuclear chains affecting the production of F in AGB stars.									44	0	0	0	0	0	44			0004-637X	1538-4357		WOS:000264538900019

A pulsed molecular beam of OD (for technical reasons) with a mean laboratory-frame kinetic energy of 29.5 kJ mol(-1) was directed at continually refreshed surfaces of the representative liquids perfluoropolyether, squalane, and squalene. Laser-induced fluorescence (LIF) was excited by pulsed laser light shaped into a planar sheet, tuned to selected rovibronic transitions in the OD A-X band. The LIF emission was imaged and intensified before being captured by an external camera. Sequences of images allowed the evolution of the incident packet and scattered plumes of OD molecules to be observed. The results confirm previous observations of the internal-state distributions of the scattered OD and its differential survival probability on different liquid surfaces. New measurements of the angular distributions found them all to be broad and approximately symmetric, independent of the angle of incidence. This is interpreted as implying a high degree of atomic-scale roughness, rather than a predominant trapping-desorption mechanism, because of the other observed signatures of impulsive scattering; these include the degree of OD rotational excitation, superthermal speeds, and the correlation of speed with scattering angle. This approach has considerable potential to be applied in related gas-surface scattering experiments. It is immune from the difficulties of some other imaging methods that involve charged-particle detection and allows a spatially extended region of the scattering plane perpendicular to the surface to be imaged.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			0021-9606	1089-7690		WOS:000480258200026		
J	Yan, Chao; Zeng, Qunfeng; He, Wanjun; Zhu, Jianing								First-principles investigation on the adsorption and dissociation of O-2 and H2O molecules on the Ni-rich TiNi alloy surface								APPLIED SURFACE SCIENCE				534						147570	10.1016/j.apsusc.2020.147570				DEC 30 2020	2020	The excellent corrosion resistance of Ti-Ni binary alloy highly depends on the thin passive films spontaneously formed on the surface. For the Ni-rich 60NiTi, the TiNi3 phase would coexist with the B2 TiNi matrix phase after the final heat treatment, affecting the formation of passive films. In this study, the adsorption and dissociation of O-2 molecule on the TiNi (1 1 0) and TiNi3 (1 1 0) surface are investigated by the DFT method to have an insight into the distinction of oxidation behavior between TiNi and TiNi3 phase. Subsequently, the interaction of H2O molecule with the most stable O-2 adsorption configuration is further studied in order to clarify the atomistic evolution process when the oxidized surface is exposed to the wet air and erosion solution. The calculated results implied that the O-2-TiNi/H2O system exhibits the physisorption nature of the H2O molecule. However, the H2O molecule, when interacted with the O-2-TiNi3 configuration, can be dissociated into OH group and H atom. These then were captured to create the Ti-O, Ni-O and H-O bond. This study may provide the useful details involved in the formation of oxide/alloy interface on the Ni-rich TiNi alloy as well as the interaction of oxide/alloy with the water solution.									9	0	0	0	0	0	8			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000582367700018

Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) images verify their core-shell structure. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) results indicate there are interaction between BiVO4 and Fe2O3, confirming the formation of heterojunction. Mott-Schottky measurements exhibit that hybridizing with Fe2O3 makes the conduction band of BiVO4 to be shifted up by 1.05 V from 021 to -0.84 V, which endows BiVO4 to be effective for photocatalytic H-2 generation. Meanwhile, photoluminescence spectra show that the heterosturcture decreases the recombination efficiency of photo-induced electrons and holes. Hydrogen experiments indicate that BiVO4@Fe2O3 composite containing 10 wt% Fe2O3 has the highest catalytic activity.

Rayleigh Scattering Measurements of Heating and Gas Perturbations Accompanying Femtosecond Laser Tagging								AIAA JOURNAL				55	1			112	120		10.2514/1.J054772				JAN 2017	2017	Planar Rayleigh scattering and Rayleigh scattering polarimetry are applied toward measurements of molecular dissociation, thermometry, and the visualization of fluid dynamics in the afterglow of a femtosecond laser plasma under conditions relevant to the femtosecond laser tagging diagnostic. The generation of shock waves and a hightemperature region are observed, with a corresponding temperature increase of 280 +/- 40 K (320 mu J, N-2) and 860 +/- 160 K(780 mu J, N-2) produced with a 175mmfocusing lens. The spatial profile of the temperature rise along the beam is found to scale linearly with the optical emission intensity. The transverse width of the emission region is also observed to correlate with increased temperature. Rayleigh polarimetry measurements show a high dissociation fraction of up to 0.46 +/- 0.04 (780 mu J, N-2). Modeling of three-body recombination into the N-2 (B-3 Pi(g), v') state using the measured dissociation fraction is able to reproduce the emission intensity time history between 1 and 50 mu s. Local heating is found to play a key role in the observed trends in the spatial profile, width, intensity, and temporal evolution of femtosecond laser tagging at laser intensities near or above 3.9 x 10(14) W/cm(2).					53rd AIAA Aerospace Sciences Meeting / AIAA Atmospheric Flight Mechanics Conference / 17th AIAA Non-Deterministic Approaches Conference / AIAA Science and Technology Forum and Exposition (SciTech) / AIAA Infotech at Aerospace Conference53rd AIAA Aerospace Sciences Meeting / AIAA Atmospheric Flight Mechanics Conference / 17th AIAA Non-Deterministic Approaches Conference / AIAA Science and Technology Forum and Exposition (SciTech) / AIAA Infotech at Aerospace Conference	JAN 05-09, 2015JAN 05-09, 2015	AIAAAIAA	Kissimmee, FLKissimmee, FL	20	3	0	0	0	0	22			0001-1452	1533-385X		WOS:000392511000010

The Faraday-shielded ICPs were separated by a grounded metal grid. Power (13.56 MHz) to the main ICP was pulsed with a frequency of 1 kHz, while the auxiliary ICP was operated in continuous wave (cw) mode. In chlorine plasmas, ignition delay was observed for duty cycles greater than 60% and, in contrast to expectation, the delay was longer with increasing duty cycle up to similar to 99.5%. The ignition delay could be varied by changing the auxiliary and/or main ICP power. Langmuir probe measurements provided the temporal evolution of electron temperature, and electron and positive ion densities. These measurements revealed that the plasma was ignited shortly after the decaying positive ion density (n(+)), in the afterglow of the main ICP, reached the density (n(+), (aux)) prevailing when only the auxiliary ICP was powered. At that time, production of electrons began to dominate their loss in the main ICP, due to hot electron injection from the auxiliary ICP. As a result, ne increased from a value below n(e), (aux), improving inductive power coupling efficiency, further increasing plasma density leading to plasma ignition. Plasma ignition delay occurred when the afterglow of the pulsed plasma was not long enough for the ion density to reach n(+), (aux) during the afterglow. Besides Cl-2, plasma ignition delays were also observed in other electronegative gases (SF6, CF4/O-2 and O-2) but not in an electropositive gas (Ar).									10	1	0	0	0	0	11			0022-3727	1361-6463		WOS:000368434600012

It has been rapidly moving to non-noble elements and their compounds in recent years, notably transition metals and even non-metals. They are of heterogeneous types, where the active species are refined to atomic dispersion scales on the surfaces/sub-surfaces of the solid support. The catalytic performance is governed by both the type and population of accessible active sites, and their bond and coordination environment, largely as a result of the interactions with the substrate surface. Unlike the internal structure within a crystalline solid, there is a large spatial variation in the bond and coordination environment of different atoms on the solid surface across different length scales, and in particular with the unsaturated surface, where there are various defects. They can also be dramatically altered during both the catalyst synthesis and actual catalysis process. In a way, they form a "surface heterocompound", where the local bonds for each metal atom are of a compound type, while there can be a large variation from one to another. Herein, we will look into the evolution from traditional heterogeneous catalysts to SACs, from the surface heterocompound perspective. Discussion will then be made on the on-going strategies and challenges in manipulating and identifying the local bond and coordination environment on the hetero-surfaces, in an attempt to develop efficient catalysts for the targeted applications, where both synthesis techniques and analytical tools are critically important, and computational studies can provide the key guiding principles. With selected paradigm studies, we will briefly examine the future perspectives for this newly emerging catalysis frontier.									26	1	0	0	1	0	27			2055-6756	2055-6764		WOS:000531354100001	32227055

Experimental results indicated that the preferred growth face ((200) crystal plane) of hexagonal WO3 could adsorb abundant Na+, which induced the WO3 growing along [001] crystal direction to form nanorods, and hexagonal phase WO3 nanorods with diameter of 30-150 nm and length of 0.5-5 mu m were obtained in the presence of 0.25 M Na2SO4, while excessive Na2SO4 led to a mixed crystal consisting of cubic H2W2O7 and hexagonal WO3. The photoactivities for O-2 evolution for various products were investigated by using Fe(NO3)(3) as a sacrificial reagent under visible-light irradiation, and the hexagonal phase WO3 nanorods show a better photoactivity than the other products with different morphologies and crystal phases due to its fast three-dimensional photogenerated carrier transfer along its special rod-shaped structure.

Tuning surface strain is an effective strategy for enhancing catalytic activity; however, the correlation studies between the surface strain with catalytic performance are scant because such mechanistic studies require the precise control of surface strain on catalysts. In this work, a simple strategy of precisely tuning compressive surface strain of atomic-layer Cu2O on Cu@Ag (AL-Cu2O/Cu@Ag) nanoparticles (NPs) is demonstrated. The AL-Cu2O is synthesized by structure evolution of Cu@Ag core-shell nanoparticles, and the precise thickness-control of AL-Cu2O is achieved by tuning the molar ratio of Cu/Ag of the starting material. Aberration-corrected high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (AC-HRTEM) and EELS elemental mapping characterization showed that the compressive surface strain of AL-Cu2O along the [111] and [200] directions can be precisely tuned from 6.5% to 1.6% and 6.6% to 4.7%, respectively, by changing the number of AL-Cu2O layer from 3 to 6. The as-prepared AL-Cu2O/Cu@Ag NPs exhibited excellent catalytic property in the synthesis of azobenzene from aniline, in which the strained 4-layers Cu2O (4.5% along the [111] direction, 6.1% along the [200] direction) exhibits the best catalytic performance. This work may be beneficial for the design and surface engineering of catalysts toward specific applications.									14	1	0	0	1	0	14			1998-0124	1998-0000		WOS:000467495900027

Yuan, Guanghui/0000-0002-0894-3068			Feldspar dissolution, authigenic clays, and quartz cements in open and closed sandstone geochemical systems during diagenesis: Typical examples from two sags in Bohai Bay Basin, East China								AAPG BULLETIN				99	11			2121	2154		10.1306/07101514004				NOV 2015	2015	Feldspar dissolution and precipitation of clays and quartz cements are important diagenetic reactions affecting reservoir quality evolution in sandstones with detrital feldspars. We examined two sets of sandstone reservoirs to determine whether the sandstone diagenetic systems were open or closed to the mass transfer of products from feldspar dissolution and its impact on reservoir quality. One of the reservoirs is the Eocene fan delta sandstone buried 2.5-4.0 km (1.5-2.5 mi) below sea level (BSL) in the Gaoliu (GL) area of the Nanpu sag, and the other is the Eocene subaqueous fan sandstone buried 1.5-4.5 km (1-2.8 mi) BSL in the Shengtuo (ST) area of the Dongying sag.Both sandstones consist mainly of lithic arkoses and feldspathic litharenites, and have secondary porosity formed by dissolution of feldspars. In the GL sandstones, the absolute amounts of authigenic clays and quartz cements (generally <0.5% of the rock volume) are much lower than that of the leached feldspars. Authigenic clays in the GL sandstones are mainly kaolinite, with little illite even at a high temperature (>125 degrees C [257 degrees F]). The low abundance of authigenic clays and quartz cements, and low pore-water salinity indicate that much of the K+, Al3+, and SiO2(aq) released from leached K-feldspars were exported from the GL sandstone system. And the extensive feldspar dissolution enhanced much porosity and permeability.In contrast, the ST sandstones with secondary pores formed by feldspar dissolution generally contain authigenic clays (kaolinite and Mite) and quartz cements with almost identical volume of secondary pores. Kaolinite dominates in the ST sandstones at shallower depth (<3.1 km [2 mi] BSL), whereas illite dominates at greater depth (>3.1 km [2 mi] BSL) where temperature exceeds 125 degrees C (257 degrees F). The presence of abundant clays and quartz cements indicates that Al3+ and SiO2(aq) released from leached feldspars were retained in the ST sandstone system. The dominance of authigenic illite at greater depth indicates that sufficient K+ should have been retained within the sandstones for occurrence of illitization of kaolinite and feldspars. Secondary porosity in thin sections can be up to 3%, but little porosity (<0.25%) is enhanced. Primary macropores are lost as clays and quartz precipitate whereas the proportion of microporosity increases, occurring mainly between clay crystals. The overall result is that permeability is degraded.The diagenetic difference between the GL and the ST sandstones can be interpreted by assessing pore-water evolution in these two areas. The current pore waters with low salinity and negative hydrogen isotopic compositions in the GL sandstone system indicate the significant impact of meteoric water, whereas the current pore waters with high salinity and the paleofluids with positive oxygen isotopic compositions in the ST sandstone system indicate little trace of meteoric water. Access of meteoric freshwater to the GL area probably occurred during the late Oligocene to Neogene through widely developed faults in the Paleogene and Neogene strata. The low-salinity water could have been responsible for flushing of solutes derived from feldspar dissolution. As such, diagenesis in the GL sandstones is considered to have occurred in an open geochemical system, whereas with limited faults and high water salinity, the ST sandstones acted as a closed geochemical system where precipitation of kaolinite, illite, and quartz cements occurred following dissolution of feldspars.									94	11	0	0	2	0	100			0149-1423	1558-9153		WOS:000363601800007

Recently, infections by a S. aureus strain carrying the enterococcal vancomycin resistance vanA gene cluster were reported. The possible emergence and dissemination of these strains is a serious health threat and makes optimization of prevention strategies and fast detection methods absolutely necessary. In the present study. we developed a PCR protocol for simultaneous detection of enterococcal vanA and vanB genes, the staphylococcal methicillin and mupirocin resistance markers mecA and ileS-2, and identification of S. aureus. As no vancomycin-resistant S. aureus isolates were available for our study, we used mixtures of enterococcal and staphylococcal colonies that harbored the different resistance markers to show that these genes could be detected simultaneously. This protocol could be used to facilitate the detection and identification of predictable S. aureus or methicillin-resistant strains carrying vanA or vanB.									27	2	0	0	22	0	31			1139-6709	1618-1905		WOS:000186379600006	12802618	
J	BLUNDY, JD; SPARKS, RSJ								PETROGENESIS OF MAFIC INCLUSIONS IN GRANITOIDS OF THE ADAMELLO MASSIF, ITALY								JOURNAL OF PETROLOGY				33	5			1039	&		10.1093/petrology/33.5.1039				OCT 1992	1992	The Tertiary Adamello calc-alkaline batholith in the Italian Alps is characterized by tonalite and granodiorite plutons associated with small mafic/ultramafic intrusions, syn-plutonic mafic dykes and sills, and ubiquitous mafic inclusions. In the southernmost Val Fredda Complex, syn-plutonic hornblende-gabbro and diorite sheets pass laterally into swarms of mafic inclusions intermingled with tonalite. Petrological and geochemical data show that the mafic sheets represent hydrous mafic magmas derived by fractional crystallization from parental hydrous basalt and picro-basalt. The fractionation process is recorded by inclusions of spinel, olivine, and pyroxenes in the cores of hornblende phenocrysts and by the widespread occurrence of calcic plagioclase. Fractionation occurred at high pressure (P(total) = 8-10 kb) before intrusion at shallow depths (P(total) almost-equal-to 2 kb). Geothermometry and melting experiments at P(H2O) = 1 kb, combined with textural evidence, indicate that the mafic sheets were emplaced at temperatures of 1050-1100-degrees-C into hot, but consolidated, granitoid host rocks. Transfer of heat and hydrous fluids from the sheets remobilized the host rocks into crystal-mush, which in turn disrupted the sheet margins to form mafic inclusions. Dynamic crystallization experiments indicate that the mafic inclusions and sheet margins were quenched to temperatures below 970-degrees-C, resulting in the failure of the high-temperature liquidus phases olivine and clinopyroxene to nucleate and the formation of acicular hornblende and plagioclase. Several other Adamello plutons display syn-plutonic intrusions and mafic inclusions with comparable features to the Val Fredda Complex.The Adamello mafic inclusions show pronounced enrichments in certain trace elements compared with values expected by fractional crystallization and magma mixing. K, Rb, Ba, Y, heavy REE, Mn, and Nb have absolute abundances in the inclusions greater than the interiors of neighbouring mafic sheets and, in some cases, than the host granitoids. Many inclusions also display leucocratic haloes, margins rich in ferromagnesian minerals and abundant groundmass biotite. These features are interpreted in terms of a three-stage evolution. (1) A blob of mafic magma is quenched by the felsic host to form a rigid crystal-rich inclusion containing an interstitial melt phase. Leucocratic haloes and crenulate margins to the inclusions form as a result of volume contraction on cooling. (2) The more mobile elements (notably the alkalis and H2O) diffuse between the melt phases of host and inclusion. Using published experimental data on the variation of melt fraction with temperature in hydrous basic and acid magmas, it is argued that the observed diffusion of K from host to inclusion requires interaction temperatures of >900-degrees-C. Reaction of K-enriched melt with existing hornblende in the inclusion forms biotite, which sequesters and concentrates further K2O and other alkaline elements. (3) During protracted cooling the mafic inclusions equilibrate with interstitial melt in the host granitoid. Equilibrium partitioning of heavy REE and Y into the mafic minerals in the inclusion results in the observed enrichments. Magnetite likewise concentrates Nb and Mn. It is proposed that mafic inclusions form in the waning stage of pluton evolution when the granitoid magma is sufficiently consolidated to allow the penetration of mafic intrusions, but sufficiently hot to be readily remobilized and disrupt these intrusions to form mafic inclusions. Subsequent chemical equilibration of mafic inclusions with their host can have a marked impact on the trace element chemistry of both rock types. Granitoids which have experienced extensive interaction with mafic inclusion-forming magmas may undergo significant depletion in those trace elements which partition strongly into the minerals of the mafic inclusion.									241	19	0	0	3	1	251			0022-3530			WOS:A1992KA51200003

Two hybrid catalysts with different niobium oxide content (5 wt% and 12 wt%) are compared at the beginning and end of potential cycling. We observe an overall increase in the particle size of the hybrid catalysts after potential cycling, mediated by Ostwald ripening process. The general nanostructure of the catalysts was composed of small Pt-rich particles that were linked to niobium oxide particles. Nanoscale and microscale spectroscopy of the pristine materials reveals several co-existing oxidized forms of niobium (5(+), 4(+), 2(+)) in the systems; the most predominant being Nb(V). The study of the energy loss near-edge structure of the Niobium L-2,L-3 edge of catalysts after being subjected to accelerated stress test (AST) potential cycles provides clues on the evolution of niobium oxides (NbOx), in which the relative distribution of Nb(V) decreases, while the number of Nb particles in lower oxidation states slightly increases. Furthermore, energy-dispersive spectroscopy reveals that the content of Nb decreased after cycling, implying that the loss of NbOx eventually altered the fraction of linked Pt-NbOx sites. The observed nanoscale catalyst changes and the presence of the NbOx may have important implications for developing an alternative design for improved hybrid catalyst materials.

The plasma discharge, gas heating, mass, and heat transfer processes in one working cycle are modeled and analyzed. Gas discharge starts inside the igniter, the 'ladder-like' dielectric wall structure promotes the transition of a volumetric discharge to a surface discharge, establishing a conductive path between the electrodes over a timescale of tens of nanoseconds. Once the electrodes are short-circuited, a new spark-arc discharge channel forms, heating the gas up to 7000-10 000 K in the discharge channel and 2000-4000 K in the igniter. The gas molecules are dissociated and pushed out of the igniter, forming a 'heating core' with high temperature (2000-3000 K) and chemical activity following a wavefront propagating with a velocity of 750-875 m s(-1). The calculated evolution of the heating core agrees well with the ICCD measurements. It is found that the 'ladder-like' structure does not affect the penetration depth or expansion radius of the heating core, but leads to a complex vortical flow that allows for chemical activity species to be brought out into the ambient gas.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0022-3727	1361-6463		WOS:000708211300001

Here, we evaluate water electrolysis at pH 7 that is milder than acidic and alkaline pH counterparts and may overcome this issue. The physicochemical properties of concentrated buffer electrolytes were assessed at various temperatures and molalities for quantitative determination of losses associated with mass-transport during the water electrolysis. Subsequently, in saturated K-phosphate solutions at 80 degrees C and 100 degrees C that were found to be optimal to minimize the losses originating from mass-transport at the neutral pH, the water electrolysis performance over model electrodes of IrO(x)and Pt as an anode and a cathode, respectively, was reasonably comparable with those of the extreme pH. Remarkably, this concentrated buffer solution also achieved enhanced stability, adding another merit of this electrolyte for water electrolysis.									16	0	0	0	3	0	16			1864-5631	1864-564X		WOS:000569826400001	32875653

Like photosynthesis, where photons are converted into energy-rich molecules, sunlight energy can be converted into H-2 and O-2 using photoelectrochemical water splitting cells (PECs). Despite the fact that silicon is considered one of the most attractive semiconductors for manufacturing photoelectrodes, its use is currently limited by its low activity and its instability in aqueous solutions. Herein, we report on surprisingly stable Si-based photoanodes, fabricated by simple aqueous electrodeposition, which results in the partial (<20%) coating of the Si surface with dispersed Ni nanoparticles (NPs). We show that photoelectrochemical activation considerably improves their performance by generating a high-activity catalytic shell around the Ni NPs. In addition, we demonstrate the stability of the photoanodes under various conditions in highly corrosive alkaline solutions in operation and in inactivity. The protection in operation is explained by anodic passivation, which generates a stabilizing SiOx layer. In contrast, the stability when no polarization is applied is unexpected because most of the Si, highly prone to etching, is in contact with the very corrosive aqueous phase. The experimental data allow us to propose a mechanism explaining this effect.									39	1	0	0	2	0	38			1754-5692	1754-5706		WOS:000445215400025

Systematic dating and fluid inclusion studies show that they can be grouped into several hydrothermal episodes related with the waning Variscan orogeny. The first event was at about 295 Ma followed by younger pulses associated with Early Alpine rifting and extension and dated near 277, 150 and 100 to 20 Ma, respectively (events II-IV). The delta(18)O-delta D and delta(34)S studies of hydrothermal rocks have elucidated the hydrological evolution of these systems. The event I fluids are of mixed origin. They are metamorphic fluids (H2O-CO2-CH4-NaCl; delta(18)O = 4.7 to 9.3 parts per thousand; delta D ab.-34 parts per thousand) related to W-(Sn) veins and modified meteoric waters in the deep magnesian Sn-W skarns (H2O-NaCl, 4.5-6.4 wt% NaCl eq., delta(18)O = 7.37-7.8 parts per thousand; delta D = -77 to -74 parts per thousand) and epizonal shallow calcic Zn-(W) and Fe skarns (H2O-NaCl, < 8 wt% NaCl eq.; delta(18)O = -0.4 to 3.4 parts per thousand; delta D = -75 to -58 parts per thousand). They were probably formed by local hydrothermal cells that were spatially and temporally related to the youngest Variscan granites, the metals precipitating by fluid unmixing and fluid-rock reactions. The minor influence of magmatic fluids confirms that the intrusion of these granites was essentially water-undersaturated, as most of the to hydrothermal fluids were external to the igneous rocks. The fluids involved in the younger hydrothermal systems (events II-III) are very similar. The waters involved in the formation of episyenites, chlorite-rich greisens, retrograde skarns and phyllic and chlorite-rich alterations in the shear zones show no major chemical or isotopic differences. Interaction of the hydrothermal fluids with the host rocks was the main mechanism of ore formation. The composition (H2O-NaCl fluids with original salinities below 6.2 wt% NaCl eq.) and the delta(18)O (-4.6 to 6.3 parts per thousand) and delta D (-51 to -40 parts per thousand) values are consistent with a meteoric origin, with a delta(18)O-shift caused by the interaction with the, mostly igneous, host rocks. These fluids circulated within regional-scale convective cells and were then channelled along major crustal discontinuities. In these shear zones the more easily altered minerals such as feldspars, actinolite and chlorite had their delta(18)O signatures overprinted by low temperature younger events while the quartz inherited the original signature.In the shallower portions of the hydrothermal systems, asement-cover fluorite-barite-base metal veins formed by mixing of these deep fluids with downwards percolating brines. These brines are also interpreted as of meteoric origin (delta(18)O < approximate to = -4 parts per thousand; delta D = -65 to -36 parts per thousand) that leached the solutes (salinity >14 wt% NaCl eq.) from evaporites hosted in the post-Variscan sequence. The delta D values are very similar to most of those recorded by Kelly and Rye in Panasqueira and confirm that the Upper Paleozoic meteoric waters in central Iberia had very negative delta D values (less than or equal to-52 parts per thousand) whereas those of Early Mesozoic age ranged between -65 and -36 parts per thousand.									52	0	0	0	1	0	52			0026-4598	1432-1866		WOS:000088937700005

Given that two-dimensional (2D) materials are widely exploited for sustainable energy conversion and storage applications, the optimization of SACs with respect to diverse 2D materials is of importance. Herein, using density functional theory (DFT) and machine learning (ML) approaches, we highlight a new perspective for the rational design of TM-SACs. We have tuned the electronic properties of similar to 364 rationally designed catalysts by embedding 3d/4d/5d TM single atoms in diverse substrates including g-C3N4, pi-conjugated polymer, pyridinic graphene, and hexagonal boron nitride with single and double vacancy defects each with a mono- or dual-type non-metal (B, N, and P) doped configuration. In ML analysis, we use various types of electronic, geometric and thermodynamic descriptors and demonstrate that our model identifies stable and high-performance HER electrocatalysts. From the DFT results, we found 20 highly promising candidates which exhibit excellent HER activities (|Delta G(H*)| <= 0.1 eV). Remarkably, Pd@B-4, Ru@N2C2, Pt@B2N2, Fe@N-3, Fe@P-3, Mn@P-4 and Fe@P-4 show practically near thermo-neutral binding energies (|Delta G(H*)| = 0.01-0.02 eV). This work provides a fundamental understanding of the rational design of efficient TM-SACs for H-2 production through water-splitting.									9	0	0	0	0	0	9			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000758997800001

Different amino acid substitutions within this binding site have been found to reduce herbicide affinities, thereby conferring herbicide resistance. In Synechocystis PCC 6714 we have selected 7 single mutants and 6 double mutants resistant to various herbicides due to amino acid substitutions at different positions in the Q(B) Pocket. Characterization of these mutants consists in molecular determination of the mutations in the psbAI genes and in transformation of Synechocystis PCC 6803 by the cloned mutated genes to analyze the role of the mutations in the mutant phenotypes. Comparison with equivalent Chlamydomonas mutants is presented. These studies allow us to specify the interactions of several amino acid residues with herbicides and Q(B) and with each other. Furthermore some Synechocystis mutants present additional characteristics such as an increased sensitivity to photoinhibition, or resistance to formate or modification of the oscillatory pattern of oxygen evolution. Among the 6 point-mutations giving herbicide resistance, only those located at the limit of the loop and the parallel helix produced additional effects on photosystem II function.									6	0	0	0	6	0	6			0939-5075			WOS:A1993LB47900015

While the commonly used Cu2S/Cu counter electrode is easy to be eroded off by sulfur electrolyte, resulting in photoanode pollution. Herein, rough polyhedron Cu/Co@NCF composite is smoothly prepared via hydrothermal and synchronous doping method to replace Cu2S/Cu application. With the ZIF-67 as carbon source and morphology support, Cu and Co nanoparticles (NPs) are uniformly embedded in the carbon polyhedron without agglomeration, while the doping of nitrogen makes the composites have better porous structure. Combining the superior catalytic from Cu and Co particles with the electrical conductivity and stability from the carbon frame, the Cu/Co@NCF composite as QDSSCs counter electrode achieves an excellent photoelectric conversion effect (6.66%), close to that of Cu2S/Cu (7.29%). With stable and excellent counter electrode performance, Cu/Co@NCF composite unquestionably has the potential to be an alternative material for the CE application of QDSSCs.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			0038-092X	1471-1257		WOS:000805970000004

The Sn-Sb-RuOx interlayer played a very important role in enhancing the stability of the PbO2 coating electrodeposited at a low current density. The scanning electron microscopy results showed that the cracks in the Sn-Sb-RuOx coating were larger than those in the Sn-SbOx coating. Moreover, the Ti/Sn-Sb-RuOx/beta-PbO2 coating had many large pits with pore diameters in the range of 50-180 tun and pore depths of < 18.4 mu m. The electrodeposition mechanism of beta-PbO2 was investigated by cyclic voltammetry. Compared to the compact beta-PbO2 anode, the porous P-PbO2 anode showed superior electrocatalytic activity and electrochemical stability.

A stable solid-electrolyte interphase (SEI) and suppression of active material pulverization remain the greatest challenges to achieving efficient long-term cycling. Herein, studies of NMC622 (1 mAh cm(-2)) cathodes were performed using highly concentrated N-methyl-N-propylpyrrolidinium bis(fluorosulfonyl)imide (C(3)mpyrFSI) 50 mol % lithium bis(fluorosulfonyl)imide (LiFSI) ionic liquid electrolyte (ILE). The resulting SEI formed at the cathode enabled promising cycling performance (98.13% capacity retention after 100 cycles), and a low degree of ion mixing and lattice expansion was observed, even at an elevated temperature of 50 degrees C. Fitting of acquired impedance spectra indicated that the SEI resistivity (R-SEI) had a low and stable contribution to the internal resistivity of the system, whereas active material pulverization and secondary grain isolation significantly increased the charge transfer resistance (R-CT) throughout cycling.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000787373300021	35274926

Geometry optimizations indicate that a Ti atom in low-energy AgnTi cluster occupies the highest coordination position. The growth of the ground state structure shows an obvious regularity. The infrared, Raman and photoelectron spectra of AgnTi isomers have been simulated and can be used for their structural identification in the future. The AgnTi clusters with 19 and 17 valence electrons are respectively the easiest to lose and obtain one electron. The stability and chemical activity of the most stable structures have been analyzed by means of the averaged binding energy, dissociation energy and the gap of energy level. It is found that the AgnTi cluster has greater stability and large energy gap and can be regarded as a superatom. Silver-titanium cluster as a CO adsorption material must have very small size or the concentration of Ti atoms must reach a certain value. The calculation of magnetic moment and charge distribution shows that the magnetic moment of Ti atom in AgnTi cluster increases almost completely for n = 1-8, and significantly decreases or quenches for n = 9-16. The charge transfer between Ti and Ag atoms is the main reason for the change of magnetic moment of Ti atom.									16	0	0	0	0	0	16			0022-3697	1879-2553		WOS:000586405300048

Samples of both native and recombinant spinach manganese stabilizing protein incubated at 90 degrees C and then cooled to 25 degrees C were capable of rebinding to, and of reactivating, the O-2-evolution activity of photosystem II membranes from which the native protein had been removed. Far-UV circular dichroism and FT-IR spectroscopies were used to analyze the structural consequences of heating manganese stabilizing protein. The data obtained from these techniques show that heating causes a complete loss of the protein's secondary structure, and that this is a reversible, noncooperative phenomenon. Upon cooling, the secondary structures of the heat-treated proteins return to a state similar to, but not identical with, that of the native, unheated controls. Restoration of a near-native tertiary structure is confirmed both by size-exclusion chromatography and by near-UV circular dichroism. The functional and structural thermostability of manganese stabilizing protein reported here, in conjunction with additional known properties of this protein (acidic pI, high random coil and turn content, anomalous hydrodynamic behavior), identifies manganese stabilizing protein as a natively unfolded protein [Weinreb et al. (1996) Biochemistry 35, 13709-13715]. Although these proteins lack amino acid sequence identity, their functional solution conformations under physiological conditions are said to be "natively unfolded". We suggest that, as with other members of this family of proteins, the natively unfolded structure of manganese stabilizing protein facilitates the highly effective protein-protein interactions that are necessary for its assembly into photosystem II.									88	4	0	0	79	0	91			0006-2960			WOS:000078835800047	9890923

CO2 evolution rate, O-2 uptake rate and heat production rate varied by a factor of 2 for a continuous culture grown at a dilution rate of 0.10 h(-1). Elemental analysis showed that the carbon mass fraction of biomass did not change. Since the reactor is not at steady state, the elemental and energy balances were calculated on cumulated quantities, i.e. the integral of the reaction rates. It was possible to show that carbon, degree of reduction and energy balances matched. Application of simple mass balance principles for non-steady state systems indicated that oscillations were basically characterized by changes in biomass production rate. In addition, the amount of intermediates, e.g. ethanol or acetate, produced or consumed was negligible. Growth rate was low during the S-phase (0.075 h(-1)) and high during the G2, M and GI phases (0.125 h(-1)) for a constant dilution rate of 0.10 h(-1). However, nitrogen, ash, sulfur and potassium content showed systematic increases during the S-phase (bud initiation). Cell component analyses showed that changes in cellular fractions during oscillations (storage carbohydrate content decreased during the S-phase) were due to changes in production rates, particularly for protein and carbohydrates. Nevertheless, using the data evaluation techniques for dynamic systems presented here, it was shown that storage carbohydrates are not consumed during the S-phase. Only the synthesis rate of the different cell components changed depending on position in cell cycle. The growth process may be divided into two phenomena: the formation of new cells during mitosis with a low yield, and size increase of new born cells with high yield. Both kinetic and stoichiometric coefficients varied with the position in the oscillation: the results showed that biomass structure changed and that specific growth rate, as well as biomass yield, varied by +/- 25% during the oscillation.									43	0	0	0	30	0	44			0168-1656			WOS:A1996VP86100006	8987629

Herein, phosphorus and Ni complex modified g-C3N4 were prepared by a hydrothermal method. The bonding of electron-rich phosphorous heteroatom to the g-C3N4 changed the morphology of the g-C3N4 from nanosheets into nano-rods and significantly altered the electronic structure, as evident by the shift in the conduction band edge and bandgap of g-C3N4. FTIR and XPS measurements revealedthat the triazine ring is oxygen functionalized and the P atom bonded to g-C3N4 via P-N bond. Furthermore, EPR, UPS, and UV-DRS measurements revealed that the P and Ni complex reduced the localized pi-conjugated structure defects of g-C3N4 and extended the light absorption into the near IR region. The Ni complex in the photocatalysts provided the additional charge transfer band of IMCT and OMCT. EDS color mapping revealed that the Ni complex is distributed uniformly on the P-g-C3N4 surface. These surface embedded Ni complex acts as an electron trap state, thereby suppressing the charge pair recombination rate which was confirmed by the PL and TRPL measurements. The synergetic effect of Ni complex and P resulted in 86 % tetracycline degradation in 20 min. and 3272 mu mol/g of H-2 production in 4 h. Compared to bulk g-C3N4, 818 times higher H-2 production activity was achieved for the P and Ni complex modified g-C3N4.									11	1	0	0	2	0	11			0920-5861	1873-4308		WOS:000649395000001

Glyrichin is a transmembrane protein and an antibacterial peptide, exerting its functions against a wide range of pathogenic bacteria. In this study, cDNA and a BAC clone harboring the glyrichin gene were identified from rock bream and characterized. Genomic characterization showed that the OfGlyrichin gene exhibited a 3 exon-2 intron structure. OfGlyrichin is a 79-amino-acid protein with a transmembrane domain at (22)GFMMGFAVGMAAGAMEGTESCLR(44). Pairwise and multiple sequence alignments showed high identity and conservation with mammalian orthologues. Phylogenetic analysis showed a close relationship with fish species. Higher levels of OfGlyrichin transcripts were detected in the liver from healthy rock bream which were induced by immunogens like lipopolysaccharide, poly I:C, rock bream irido virus, Edwardsiella tarda and Streptococcus iniae. The synthetic peptide (pOf19) showed antibacterial activity against Escherichia coli, E. tarda, and S. iniae. Analysis of the bacterial morphological features after pOf19 peptide treatment showed breakage of the cell membrane, affirming that antibacterial function is accomplished through membrane lysis. The pOf19 peptide also showed antiviral activity against RBIV infection. The high conservation of the genomic structure and protein, together with the antimicrobial roles of OfGlyrichin, provide evidence for the evolutionary existence of this protein playing a vital role in innate immune defense in rock bream.

The as-deposited layers were annealed at different temperatures (T-a) from 500 to 1100 degrees C. The influence of annealing on layers with varying composition x was investigated by a variety of analytical techniques including photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy, reflectance and transmittance measurements, grazing incidence X-ray diffraction (GIXRD) and Fourier transform infrared spectrometry (FTIR). Before annealing, PL measurements show a shift of the spectra to higher energies with increase in carbon content. Calculations of the optical bandgap by other groups confirm this trend. The FTIR investigations show in addition to the expected Si-C bonds also the formation of oxygen and hydrogen related bonds within the layers. After annealing, solely a broad PL signal appears at energies around 2.0 eV. This might be due to luminescence of defects, created by the incorporated amount of carbon and the evolution of crystalline phases in the layers. GIXRD measurements confirmed the formation of both Si NCs after 700 degrees C and SiC NCs after annealing at 1000 degrees C. The FTIR spectra exhibit a shift of the SiC absorption band and an increase in the Si-C bond density due to the crystallization of SiC. After annealing a hydrogen passivation was performed, which leads to a strong decrease in the PL intensity. However, annealed Si-rich films show a peak around 1.2 eV after H-passivation, which might originate from quantum confinement effects in Si NCs. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

A facile hydrother-mal method is proposed for the synthesis of Nb-doped BiVO4 nanostructured thin films and detailed char-acterization was carried out to understand the morphology, crystal structure, optical, band edge, and electrochemical properties. The PEC studies revealed that the doping of Nb brings about a fourfold enhancement in BiVO4 photocurrent reaching ti 2.01 mA cm(-2) at 1.23 V vs reference hydrogen electrode (RHE). The doping of Nb was found to increase the carrier density in the bulk of BiVO4 and improve the charge separation, charge transfer, diffusion, and decrease the charge transfer resistance at the BiVO4/electrolyte interface. Importantly, a charge separation efficiency of ti 98% was achieved (at 1.23 V vs RHE) with a photocurrent density of similar to 4.5 mA cm(-2) (with hole scavenger) and stoichiometric H-2/O-2 evolution (2:1) upon Nb doping. Furthermore, the density functional theory (DFT) calculations indicated changes in bandgap and density of states which agree with the experimental results indicating favorable transformation in the bulk and surface properties of BiVO4 after the Nb substitution.

Synechococcus sp. PCC 7942 possesses two functionally distinct forms of the D1 protein, D1:1 and D1:2. Photosystem II (PSII) centers containing D1:1 are less efficient and more susceptible to photoinhibition than are centers containing D1:2, Under 50 mu mol photons m(-2). s(-1), PSII centers contain D1:1, but upon shifts to higher light (200 to 1000 mu mol photons m(-2). s(-1)), D1:1 is rapidly replaced by D1:2, with the rate of interchange dependent on the magnitude of the light shift. This interchange is readily reversed when cells are returned to 50 mu mol photons m(-2). s(-1). If, however, incubation under 200 mu mol photons m(-2). s(-1) is extended, D1:1 content recovers and by 3 h after the light shift D1:1 once again predominates. Oxygen evolution and chlorophyll (Chi) fluorescence measurements spanning the light shift and D1 interchanges showed an initial inhibition of photosynthesis at 200 mu mol photons m(-2). s(-1), which correlates with a proportional loss of total D1 protein and a cessation of growth. This was followed by recovery in photosynthesis and growth as the maximum level of D1:2 is reached after 2 h at 200 mu mol photons m(-2). s(-1) Thereafter, photosynthesis steadily declines with the loss of D1:2 and the return of the less-efficient D1:1. During the D1:1/D1:2 interchanges, no significant change occurs in the level of phycocyanin (PC) and Chl a, nor of the phycobilisome rod linkers. Nevertheless, the initial PC/Chl a ratio strongly influences the magnitude of photoinhibition and recovery during the light shifts. In Synechococcus sp. PCC 7942, the PC/Chl a ratio responds only slowly to light intensity or quality, while the rapid but transient interchange between D1:1 and D1:2 modulates PSII activity to limit damage upon exposure to excess light.									46	0	0	0	40	0	46			0032-0935			WOS:A1995TE42800016

So far, some strategies including designing nanostructures, incorporating conductive support or foreign elements have been adopted to develop efficient electrocatalysts. Herein, we summarize recent progresses and propose in-situ electrochemical activation as a new pretreating technique for enhanced catalytic performances. The activation techniques mainly comprise facile electrochemical processes such as anodic oxidation, cathodic reduction, etching, lithium-assisted tuning and counter electrode electro-dissolution. During these electrochemical treatments, the catalyst surfaces are modified from bulk phase, which can tune local electronic structures, create more active species, enlarge surface area and thus improve the catalytic performances. Meanwhile, this technique can couple the atomic, electronic structures with electrocatalysis mechanisms for water splitting. Compared to traditional chemical treatment, the in-situ electrochemical activation techniques have superior advantages such as facile operation, mild environment, variable control, high efficiency and flexibility. This review may provide guidance for improving water electrolysis efficiencies and hold promising for application in many other energy-conversion fields such as supercapacitors, fuel cells and batteries.

However, the magnetic structures of the zinc blende and wurtzite phases remain virtually unexplored. Here we discuss some of the main parameters controlling the growth of the CoO wurtzite and zinc blende polymorphs by thermal decomposition of cobalt (II) acetylacetonate. In addition, we present a detailed neutron diffraction study of oxygen deficient CoO ( CoO0.70-0.75) nanoparticles with zinc blende (similar to 15 nm) and wurtzite (similar to 30 nm) crystal structures to unravel their magnetic order and its temperature evolution. The magnetic order of the zinc blende nanoparticles is antiferromagnetic and appears at the Neel temperature T-N similar to 203 K. It corresponds to the 3rd type of magnetic ordering in a face-centered cubic lattice with magnetic moments aligned along a cube edge. The magnetic structure in the wurtzite nanoparticles turned out to be rather complex with two perpendicular components. One component is incommensurate, of the longitudinal spin wave type, with the magnetic moments confined in the ab-plane. In the perpendicular direction, this magnetic order is uncorrelated, forming quasi-two-dimensional magnetic layers. The component of the magnetic moment, aligned along the hexagonal axis, is commensurate and corresponds to the antiferromagnetic order known as the 2nd type in a wurtzite structure. The Neel temperature of wurtzite phase is estimated to be similar to 109 K. The temperature dependence of the magnetic reflections confirms the reduced dimensionality of the incommensurate magnetic order. Incommensurate magnetic structures in nanoparticles are an unusual phenomenon and in the case of wurtzite CoO it is probably caused by structural defects (e.g., vacancies, strains and stacking faults).

X-Ray Photoemission spectroscopic (XPS) and Atomic Force Microscopic (AFM) measurements were performed to analyse the electronic structure, surface chemistry, band alignment, and the morphology of the grown heterostructure. XPS analysis revealed the evolution of InN structure with nitridation time, surface electron accumulation, fermi level pinning and the band offset of the grown InN/GaN hetero structure. The valence band and conduction band offsets (VBO & CBO) were calculated to be 0.49 +/- 0.19 eV and 2.21 +/- 0.1 eV and divulged the formation of a type-I heterojunction. A Fermi Level (FL) pinning of 1.5 +/- 0.1 eV above the conduction band minima was perceived and indicated towards strong downward band bending. The analysis of the VB spectra suggested that surface electron accumulation occurred due to the presence of metallic In-adlayer on the surface which resulted in FL pinning and the corresponding downward band bending. Atomic Force Microscopy analysis divulged the formation of smooth surface with granular structure. It was also observed that the growth parameters (e.g. substrate temperature) strongly influence the aforementioned surface and interfacial properties. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Effective heterostructure compositions were synthesized by the combination of Nb2O5-MoS2 (NM) with CdS/graphene and CuS/graphene (NM-CdS/G, NMCuS/G) by using hydrothermal method. The crystallite sizes of the synthesized composites were inferred from Xray diffraction (XRD) and found in the range 17-36 nm. The outcomes of scanning electron microscope (SEM) were confirmed the formation nano-structure by estimating particles sizes in the range 35-66 nm. This distinctive configuration exhibit enhanced light absorption, effectively develop the separation and transportation of photon-excited charge carriers and significantly raise photocatalytic hydrogen production rate. The energy band gap was reduced to 2.53 eV for NM-CdS/graphene composite. The prepared composite NM-CdS/graphene exhibited 100% degradation of MO in 180 min and the hydrogen generation rate was resulted about 8.7 mmol/h. The photo-generated electrons could efficiently migrate to the surface due to intimate interfacial contacts and synergism operating between NM and MS-Graphene (M = Cd, Cu) and the resulting improved separation potency of photo-induced electrons and holes inhibits the charge recombination rate and enhances photoactivity.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			1369-8001	1873-4081		WOS:000600423100005

In this work, an elaborate study on textured Si photocathodes is reported. Compared to conventional textured Si photocathodes, the well-designed Si photocathode with randomly-distributed inverted pyramid arrays (SiIPs) generates a larger photovoltage of 440 mV for its higher effective minority carrier density, and produces a higher photocurrent density at a high reverse bias voltage due to its quasi-hydrophilicity. With the help of cobalt disulfide (CoS2) nanocrystals, sluggish charge kinetics of SiIP photocathodes can be further improved. The optimal SiIP/CoS2 photocathode yields an onset potential of 0.22 V vs. reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) and a saturated photocurrent density of 10.4 mA cm(-2) at -0.45 V (vs. RHE). Besides, this cathode produces a stable photocurrent density of similar to 6.60 mA cm(-2) at 0 V (vs. RHE) for 12 000 s in acidic media. Notably, our work presents a facile and inexpensive method to fabricate efficient Si photoelectrodes, which may promote the evolution of textured Si-based electrodes for potential photoelectrochemical and photocatalytic applications.									10	1	0	0	0	0	10			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000504106900027	31825048

As-prepared samples were characterized by high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), ultraviolet-visible diffuse reflection spectroscopy (DRS), electron spin resonance (ESR) and photoluminescence spectroscopy (PL). The structures with different core shapes and controllable shell thickness exhibited unique optical properties. It is found that the nanoscale Ag@CeO2 core-shell photocatalysts exhibit significantly enhanced photocatalytic activities in the O-2 evolution and MB dye degradation compared to pure CeO2 nanoparticals. The enhancement in photocatalytic activities can be ascribed to the localized surface plasmon resonance (SPR) of Ag cores. Moreover, larger active interfacial areas and contact between metal/semiconductor in the core-shell structure facilitate transfer of charge carriers and prolong lifetime of photogenerated electron-hole pairs. It is expected that the Ag@CeO2 core-shell structure may have great potential in a wider range of light-harvesting applications. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

The results indicate that TiO2 NPs heated at 300 degrees C in 120 Torr of CH3OH vapor is more effective than the samples heated under 800 Torr of H-2 at the same temperature. Ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy (UV-VIS), Photoluminescence spectroscopy (PL) and X-ray diffraction spectroscopy (XRD) were employed to study the optical property. The effect of temperature of hydrogenation has been systematically studied for NPs in the 200-450 degrees C range for both H-sources based on H-2 evolution, employing Xe lamp as the light source. The hydrogenated TiO2 NPs using H-2 and CH3OH have been analyzed by soft X-ray absorption near-edge structure analyses with and without Xe lamp irradiation in situ. The result indicates that CH3OH hydrogenation can induce a much stronger Ti-O interaction along direction d(z)(2) and increase the unoccupied DOS of Ti t(2g) states. This is why the CH3OH treated TiO2 exhibits a greater photo-activity. The crucial role of the hydrogenation using CH3OH was also investigated systematically and confirmed by quantum-chemical calculations with complementary synchrotron-based X-ray techniques. The results are consistent with the predicted barriers for the formation of H atoms on the TiO2 surface, 4-9 kcal/mol, considerably lower than that in the H-2 case, 48 kcal/mol.									10	0	0	0	0	0	10			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000472476200060

Herein, we report a successful N-O orbital hybridization in N-doped TiO2 nanotube, the absorption wavelength is greatly red-shifted to visible light (from 400 to 800 nm) with large absorbance. The doping N element can partially replace the oxygen sites in TiO2 lattice to form N-Ti-N bonds. The hybridization effect of N 2p and O 2p makes a continuous valence band and the position up-shift from 1.99 to 1.67 eV, the band gap is subsequently narrowed from 3.21 to 2.77 eV for 1.85-N-TiO2 nanotube, which has been confirmed by ultraviolet-visible diffuse reflectance spectra and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy valence band spectra. Benefiting from the enhanced visible light absorption ability and ultrathin shell feature, 1.85-N-TiO2 nanotube exhibits exciting photocatalytic hydrogen evolution performance with a rate of 10870 mu mol h(-1) g(-1) under the selected visible light irradiation (lambda > 400 nm). This work demonstrates an alternative strategy for tuning visible light absorption ability by doping for wide-band-gap semiconductors in photocatalysts design, and the philosophy can also be extended to other photocatalytic systems.

A number of EPR-detectable intermediates are associated with this critical state. The preceding paper examined mainly the decay Of S-3 at cryogenic temperatures leading to the formation of a proton-deficient configuration of S-2 termed S-2'. This second paper examines all intermediates formed by the near-IR light (NIR) excitation of the S-3 state and compares these with the light-excitation products of the S-2' state. The rather complex set of observations is organized in a comprehensive flowchart, the central part of which is the S-3...Q(A)(-) state. This state can be converted to various intermediates via two main pathways: (A) Excitation Of S-3 by NIR light at temperatures below 77 K results presumably in the formation of an excited S-3 state, S-3*, which decays via either of two pathways. Slowly at liquid helium temperatures but much faster at 77 K, S-3* decays to an EPR-silent state, denoted S-3", which by raising the temperature to ca. 190 K converts to a spin configuration of the Mn cluster, characterized by g = 21, 3.7 in perpendicular and g = 23 in parallel mode EPR, denoted S-3'. Upon further warming to 220 K, S3' relaxes to the untreated S3 state. Below about 77 K and more favorably at liquid helium temperatures, an alternative pathway Of S-3* decay via the metallo-radical intermediate S-2'Z(.)...Q(A)(-) can be traced. This leads to the metastable state S-2'Z...Q(A) via charge recombination. S-2'Z(.) is characterized by a split-radical signal at g = 2, while all S-2' transients are characterized by the same g = 5/2.9 (S = 7/2) Configuration of the Mn cluster with small modifications, reflecting an influence of the tyr Z oxidation state on the crystal-field symmetry at the Mn cluster. (B) S-2'...Q(A) can be reached alternatively by the slow charge recombination Of S-3 and Q(A)(-) at 77 K. White-light illumination Of S-2'...Q(A) below about 20 K results in charge separation, reforming the intermediate S-2'Z(.)...Q(A)(-). Thermally activated branches to the main pathways are also described, e.g., at elevated temperatures tyr Z(.) reoxidizes S-2' to the S-3 state. The above observations are discussed in terms of a molecular model of the S-3 state of the OEC. Main aspects of the model are the following. Intermediates, isoelectronic to S-3, are attributed to the NIR-induced translocation of the positive hole to different Mn ligands, or to tyr Z. On the basis of a comparison of the electron-donating efficiency of tyr Z and tyr D at cryogenic temperatures, it is inferred that the Mn cluster acts as the main proton acceptor from tyr Z. Water associated with the Mn cluster is assumed to be in hydrogen-bonding equilibrium with tyr Z, and an array comprising this water and adjacent water (or OH or O) ligands to Mn followed by a sequence of proton acceptors is proposed to act as an efficient proton translocation pathway. Oxidation of the tyrosine by P-680(+) repels protons to and out from the Mn cluster.This proposed role of tyr Z in the water-splitting process is described as a proton repeller/electron abstractor.									59	0	0	0	38	0	59			0006-2960			WOS:000177111600035	12135381

In wild type thylakoids the peak temperature of the A(T) band (pH 6.5) was at - 16.2 +/- 0.1 degrees C. Maximal thermoluminescence yield was achieved at an illumination temperature of approx. -20 degrees C, as previously observed in spinach PS II particles by Ono and Inoue (FEBS Lett. 278 (1991) 183-186). In contrast to previous observations, we found only a weak pH-dependence of the A, band intensity, from pH 5.5 to 8 in thylakoids or PS II particles from C. reinhardtii or spinach. Conversion of H195 of the D1 polypeptide of PS II to asparagine (H195N), tyrosine (H195Y), or aspartate (H195D) decreased the amplitudes of the A(T) bands to approx. 65, 53 and 38% of that of wild type, but did not significantly alter the peak temperatures of the bands. The residual A(T) bands in the H195 mutant strains showed illumination temperature- and flash number-dependencies, and pH dependencies similar to those of wild type. Therefore, we suggest that the quantum yield of the luminescence, rather than the energetics of the recombinatory pathway, was modified in the H195 mutants. In other experiments (Roffey, R.A., Kramer, D.M., Govindjee, and Sayre, R.T. (1994) Biochim. Biophys. Acta, in press), we concluded that the equilibrium constant between YZP+ and (YP)-P-Z+ in Mn-depleted material was dramatically shifted (about 50-fold) in the H195D mutant relative to WT. Since we found no effect of the H195 mutation on the peak temperature of the A(T) band, we concluded that Y-Z is probably not the trap for the positive charge involved in the A(T) band recombination, in agreement with the conclusion of Ono and Inoue (FEBS Lett. 278 (1991) 183-186). We also conclude that H195 cannot be the redox group responsible for carrying the positive charge for the AT band recombination. Modification of H190 to phenylalanine completely abolished the A(T) band, but also severely affected PS II donor reactions by slowing the electron transfer from tyrosine Y-Z to the oxidized primary donor P-680(+) by approx. 100- to 1000-fold. It was not possible to determine whether the loss of the A(T) band upon H190 modification was due to the removal of a redox-active histidine or to the secondary effects the modification had on electron transfer reactions. We present a kinetic model that explains many of the data on the A(T) band.									41	0	0	0	32	0	41			0005-2728			WOS:A1994NK09700011

IV. THE TWO POPULATIONS WITH [Fe/H] less than or similar to-3.0								ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL				762	1					28	10.1088/0004-637X/762/1/28				JAN 1 2013	2013	We discuss the carbon-normal and carbon-rich populations of Galactic halo stars having [Fe/H] less than or similar to -3.0, utilizing chemical abundances from high-resolution, high signal-to-noise model-atmosphere analyses. The C-rich population represents similar to 28% of stars below [Fe/H] = -3.1, with the present C-rich sample comprising 16 CEMP-no stars, and two others with [Fe/H] similar to -5.5 and uncertain classification. The population is O-rich ([O/Fe] greater than or similar to + 1.5); the light elements Na, Mg, and Al are enhanced relative to Fe in half the sample; and for Z > 20 (Ca) there is little evidence for enhancements relative to solar values. These results are best explained in terms of the admixing and processing of material from H-burning and He-burning regions as achieved by nucleosynthesis in zero-heavy-element models in the literature of "mixing and fallback" supernovae (SNe); of rotating, massive, and intermediate-mass stars; and of Type II SNe with relativistic jets. The available (limited) radial velocities offer little support for the C- rich stars with [Fe/H] < -3.1 being binary. More data are required before one could conclude that binarity is key to an understanding of this population. We suggest that the C- rich and C- normal populations result from two different gas cooling channels in the very early universe of material that formed the progenitors of the two populations. The first was cooling by fine-structure line transitions of C II and OI (to form the C- rich population); the second, while not well defined (perhaps dust- induced cooling?), led to the C- normal group. In this scenario, the C- rich population contains the oldest stars currently observed.									133	3	0	0	0	0	135			0004-637X	1538-4357		WOS:000313007900028

Here, we report a direct synthesis of Ni3N/Ni enriched with N-vacancies using one-step magnetron sputtering. The surface state of Ni3N(001) with 75% N-vacancies is hydrogen-terminated and exhibits four inequivalent Ni-3-hollow sites. This leads to stronger H* binding compared to Ni(111), and is affirmed as the most stable surface termination under the electrochemical working conditions (pH approximate to 13.8 and E = -0.1 V) from the Pourbaix diagram. The Ni3N/Ni catalyst shows low crystallinity and good wettability and exhibits a low overpotential of 89 mV vs. RHE at 10 mA cm(-2) in 1.0 M KOH with excellent stability over 3 days. This performance closely matches that of the Pt catalyst synthesized under the same conditions and surpasses that of other reported earth-abundant catalysts on planar substrates. The application of Ni3N/Ni as a cocatalyst on Si photocathodes produces an excellent ABPE of 9.3% and over 50 h stability. Moreover, its feasibility for practical application was confirmed with excellent performance on porous substrates and robustness at high operating currents in zero-gap alkaline electrolysis cells. Our work demonstrates a general approach for the feasible synthesis of other transition metal nitride catalysts for electrochemical and photoelectrochemical energy conversion applications.									7	0	0	0	0	0	7			1754-5692	1754-5706		WOS:000715927900001

With the aim of gaining insights into photocatalytic materials, we use density functional theory (DFT) calculations within the HSE06 functional to analyze the evolution of optoelectronic properties and high- frequency dielectric constant profiles of various 2D MoO3-xSx/MoS2 heterostructures modified by chemical and physical approaches. Although the MoO3/MoS2 heterostructure is a type III heterojunction associated with a metallic character, we found that exchanging the terminal oxo atoms of the MoO3-xSx single layer (SL) with sulfur enables shifting its CB position above the VB position of the MoS2 SL. This trend gives rise to a type II heterojunction where the band gap and charge transfer within the two layers are driven continuously by the S concentration in the MoO3-xSx SL. This fine-tuning leads to a versatile type II heterostructure proposed to provide a direct Z-scheme system valuable for photocatalytic water splitting.									12	0	0	0	2	0	12			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000683741400117	34309377

We define the term "biogeochemical functional group" to refer to groups of organisms that mediate specific chemical reactions in the ocean. Thus, according to this definition, "functional groups" have no phylogenetic meaning-these are composed of many different species with common biogeochemical functions.Substantial progress has been made in the last decade toward quantifying the rates of these various functions and understanding the factors that control them. For some of these groups, we have developed fairly sophisticated models that incorporate this understanding, e.g. for diazotrophs (e.g. Trichodesmium), silica producers (diatoms) and calcifiers (e.g. coccolithophorids and specifically Emiliania huxleyi). However, current representations of nitrogen fixation and calcification are incomplete, i.e., based primarily upon models of Trichodesmium and E huxleyi, respectively, and many important functional groups have not yet been considered in open-ocean biogeochemical models. Progress has been made over the last decade in efforts to simulate dimethylsulfide (DMS) production and cycling (i.e., by dinoflagellates and prymnesiophytes) and denitrification, but these efforts are still in their infancy, and many significant problems remain.One obvious gap is that virtually all functional group modeling efforts have focused on autotrophic microbes, while higher trophic levels have been completely ignored. It appears that in some cases (e.g., calcification), incorporating higher trophic levels may be essential not only for representing a particular biogeochemical reaction, but also for modeling export. Another serious problem is our tendency to model the organisms for which we have the most validation data (e.g., E huxleyi and Trichodesmium) even when they may represent only a fraction of the biogeochemical functional group we are trying to represent.When we step back and look at the paleo-oceanographic record, it suggests that oxygen concentrations have played a central role in the evolution and emergence of many of the key functional groups that influence biogeochemical cycles in the present-day ocean. However, more subtle effects are likely to be important over the next century like changes in silicate supply or turbulence that can influence the relative success of diatoms versus dinoflagellates, coccolithophorids and diazotrophs. In general, inferences drawn from the paleo-oceanographic record and theoretical work suggest that global warming will tend to favor the latter because it will give rise to increased stratification. However, decreases in pH and Fe supply could adversely impact coccolithophorids and diazotrophs in the future.It may be necessary to include explicit dynamic representations of nitrogen fixation, denitrification, silicification and calcification in our models if our goal is predicting the oceanic carbon cycle in the future, because these processes appear to play a very significant role in the carbon cycle of the present-day ocean and they are sensitive to climate change. Observations and models suggest that it may also be necessary to include the DMS cycle to predict future climate, though the effects are still highly uncertain. We have learned a tremendous amount about the distributions and biogeochemical impact of bacteria in the ocean in recent years, yet this improved understanding has not yet been incorporated into many of our models.All of these considerations lead us toward the development of increasingly complex models. However, recent quantitative model intercomparison studies suggest that continuing to add complexity and more functional groups to our ecosystem models may lead to decreases in predictive ability if the models are not properly constrained with available data. We also caution that capturing the present-day variability tells us little about how well a particular model can predict the future. If our goal is to develop models that can be used to predict how the oceans will respond to global warming, then we need to make more rigorous assessments of predictive skill using the available data.

J	Tremaine, Darrel M.; Froelich, Philip N.					Tremaine, Darrel/0000-0002-9581-1994			Speleothem trace element signatures: A hydrologic geochemical study of modern cave dripwaters and farmed calcite								GEOCHIMICA ET COSMOCHIMICA ACTA				121				522	545		10.1016/j.gca.2013.07.026				NOV 15 2013	2013	Trace element variations in ancient cave speleothems are often interpreted as indicators of changes in paleo-rainfall and hydrologic conditions. However, these records are difficult to interpret without an understanding of the physicochemical controls on stalagmite chemistry plus site-specific calibration of changes in net rainfall to variations in dripwater and speleothem chemistry. In this study we examine geochemical relationships between net rainfall (Precipitation minus Evapotranspiration; P-ET), drip rates, drip water chemistry, and contemporaneous calcite chemistry to test the hypothesis that speleothem Mg/Ca and Sr/Ca records are proxies for rainfall amount.HRC is contained within four low-magnesium limestone units capped sporadically by a remnant dolomitic limestone. Aqueous concentrations of magnesium (post evapotranspiration) decrease with increasing vertical travel distance between the soil zone and the point of in-cave drip emergence (Drip Path Length - DPL) as dissolved high-Mg solutions sourced from the dolomitic caprock are diluted with dissolved low-Mg limestone waters sourced from the host limestone. Dripwater Mg/Ca and Sr/Ca ratios covary and provide diagnostic indicators of the two dominant mechanisms controlling dripwater chemistry: (1) mixing of post-evaporative solutions derived from two geochemical endmembers (dissolution of dolomite and limestone); and (2) evolution of hydrochemistry away from dissolved bedrock compositions due to Prior Calcite Precipitation (PCP) above the drip sites. By resolving the linear mixing relationships for drip water Mg/Ca and Sr/Ca sources and the distribution coefficients for trace element transfer in the PCP dripwater-to-calcite precipitation reactions and applying these principles to our time series, we find that the extent of PCP production within the karst is directly controlled by the balance between Precipitation (P) and Evapotranspiration (ET): higher net rainfall (P-ET > 1: wet conditions) reduces PCP, and lower net rainfall with increased evapotranspiration (P-ET < 1) increases PCP.Farmed calcite X/Ca ratios faithfully track hydrologically-influenced seasonal variations in dripwater chemistry for X = Mg, Sr, and Na. However, the relationship between changes in net rainfall and changes in Mg/Ca and Sr/Ca ratios in modern calcite is unique at each site and differs significantly at closely-spaced drip/stalagmite locations. This suggests that in situ modern hydrochemical calibrations should be performed atop individual speleothems prior to harvesting for paleoclimate investigations, and that such calibrations may not reflect past conditions as drip paths change. We apply this understanding to published dripwater data and speleothem time series from other caves. A major implication is that in order to interpret stalagmite Sr/Ca and Mg/Ca ratios as 'wet vs. dry' proxies, speleothem Sr/Ca and Mg/Ca variations must be coherent and in-phase over all time periods (i.e., Sr/Mg ratios must be constant). These criteria will help to distinguish 'rainfall amount' versus 'rainfall source' in speleothem delta O-18 records. (c) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Zhang, LP; Happe, T; Melis, A					Happe, Thomas/0000-0003-1206-5234			Biochemical and morphological characterization of sulfur-deprived and H-2-producing Chlamydomonas reinhardtii (green alga)								PLANTA				214	4			552	561		10.1007/s004250100660				FEB 2002	2002	Sulfur deprivation in green algae causes reversible inhibition of photosynthetic activity. In the absence of S, rates of photosynthetic O-2 evolution drop below those Of O-2 consumption by respiration., As a consequence, sealed cultures of the green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii become anaerobic in the light, induce the "Fe-hydrogenase" pathway of electron transport and photosynthetically produce H-2 gas. In the course of such H-2-gas production cells consume substantial amounts of internal starch and protein. Such catabolic reactions may sustain, directly or indirectly, the H-2-production process. Profile analysis of selected photosynthetic proteins showed a precipitous decline in the amount of ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase-oxygenase (Rubisco) as a function of time in S deprivation, a more gradual decline in the level Of photosystem (PS) II and PSI proteins, and a change in the composition of the PSII light-harvesting complex (LHC-II). An increase in the level of the enzyme Fehydrogenase was noted during the initial stages of S deprivation (0-72 h) followed by a decline in the level of this enzyme during longer (t > 72 h) S-deprivation times. Microscopic observations showed distinct morphological changes in, C. reinhardtii during S deprivation and H-2 production, Ellipsoid-shaped cells (normal photosynthesis) gave way to larger and spherical cell shapes in the initial stages of S deprivation and H-2 production, followed by cell- mass reductions after longer S-deprivation and H-2-production times- It is suggested that, under S-deprivation conditions, electrons derived from a residual, PSII H2O-oxidation activity feed into the hydrogenase pathway, thereby contributing to the H-2-production process in Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. Interplay between oxygenic photosynthesis, mitochondrial respiration, catabolism of endogenous substrate, and electron transport via the hydrogenase pathway is essential for this light-mediated H-2-production process.									296	23	6	0	200	0	327			0032-0935	1432-2048		WOS:000174348500008	11925039

We investigated the hypothesis that local adaptation to altitude by the LA and HA species would be revealed as divergent effects of temperature on their physiological energetics. Two species from each group (mass similar to 350 mg) were acclimated to 19, 25 and 28 degrees C, with 19 and 28 degrees C estimated to be outside the thermal envelope for LA or HA, respectively, in the wild. Wild-caught animals (F0 generation) were compared with animals raised in captivity at 25 degrees C (F1 generation) to investigate the contribution of adaptation versus plasticity. Temperature significantly increased routine metabolic rate in all groups and generations. However, LA and HA species differed in the effects of temperature on their ability to process a meal. At 25 degrees C, the specific dynamic action (SDA) response was completed within 8 h in all groups, but acclimation to temperatures beyond the thermal envelope caused profound declines in SDA performance. At 19 degrees C, the LA required similar to 14 h to complete the SDA, whereas the HA required only similar to 7 h. The opposite effect was observed at 28 degrees C. This effect was evident in both F0 and F1. Reaction norms for effects of temperature on SDA therefore revealed a trade-off, with superior performance at warmer temperatures by LA being associated with inferior performance at cooler temperatures, and vice-versa in HA. The data indicate that divergent physiological responses to temperature in the LA and HA species reflect local adaptation to the thermal regime in their habitat, and that local adaptation to one thermal environment trades off against performance in another.									23	0	0	0	23	0	23			1932-6203			WOS:000314019100058	23349857

In this study, a full-length cDNA of a sigma class GST (abGSTsigma) (CenBank accession number EF546619) from variously colored abalone (Hatiotis diversicolor) was identified. It was 1328 bp containing an open reading frame of 624 bp, encoding 208 amino acid residues with a predicted protein molecular weight of 23.67 kDa and an estimated pI of 5.67. Sequence analysis showed that the predicted protein sequence of abGSTsigma cDNA contained the conserved domain of the GST_N_Sigma_like (PSSM: cd03039) and GST_C_Sigma_like (PSSM: cd03192). Alignment analysis demonstrated that the abGSTsigma of H. diversicolor was in a branch position with other known class sigma GSTs from different organisms. The abGSTsigma mRNA was distributed in multiple tissues tested and was highly demonstrated in the gill and mantle of normal abalones. In bacteria-challenged abalone, the abGSTsigma gene was significantly expressed in the hemocytes, gill, mantle and digestive gland and the total GSTs enzyme and SOD were also induced in the four tissues. The increased activities of SOD and GSTs can result in the elimination of reactive oxygen species (ROS) indicating antioxidant activities involved. The preliminary work revealed that the sigma class glutathione S-transferase gene abGSTsigma, a phase 11 detoxification enzyme, had a positive response to bacterial challenge, and that will lead to an insightful study on elucidating the interactions between immune responses and biotransformation exerted by abGSTsigma.

These bacteria and their magnetosomes are under special attraction because of their great useful potential in nano-biotechnological and biomedical applications. MTB are ubiquitous in aquatic environments, but their isolation and axenic cultivation in pure culture is very difficult and only a limited number of them have been isolated in pure culture.Objectives: The main goal of this study was screening, isolation and cultivation of a new strain of these fastidious bacteria in pure culture from Iran to use them and their magnetosomes.Materials and Methods: Thirty samples were collected from various aquatic habitats. Most important physicochemical environmental factors that are involved in growth of MTB in the microcosms were investigated using inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP-AES), portable dissolved oxygen meter, etc. Capillary racetrack technique and magnetic separation were used to purify and enrich MTB. Various isolation media were simultaneously used for isolation of a new magnetotactic bacterium in pure culture. Two imaging techniques were used to visualize the characterizations and cell division: transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM). Polymerase chain reaction (PCR), ChromasPro software and MEGA5 were applied for sequence analysis of the 16S rRNA gene.Results: The results revealed a correlation of important physicochemical factors such as pH and iron with growth and blooms of these bacteria in the microcosms. New strain MTB-KTN90 was isolated in a modified isolation medium at microaerophilic zone from Anzali lagoon, Iran and cultured in a modified growth medium subsequently. The phylogenetic analysis showed that the strain belongs to Alphaproteobacteria. Growth and iron uptake studies indicated an important role by this bacterium in the iron biogeochemical cycle. For the first time, this paper introduced a cultured magnetotactic Alphaproteobacterium, able to synthesize magnetosomes in the temperatures above 30 degrees C and reduce selenate oxyanion.Conclusions: This paper may serve as a guide to screening, isolation, and cultivation of more new MTB. The new isolated strain opens up good opportunities for biotechnological applications such as medicine to bioremediation processes due to its unique abilities.									7	0	0	0	6	0	7			2008-3645	2008-4161		WOS:000347733900016	25485070

It originated in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China, and spread rapidly throughout the world, causing over 5,569,679 global cases and 351,866 deaths in almost every country in the world, including Europe, particularly Italy. In general, based on existing data published to date, 80.9% of patients infected with the virus develop mild infection; 13.8% severe pneumonia; 4.7% respiratory failure, septic shock or multi-organ failure; 3% of these cases are fatal. Critical patients have been shown to develop acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and hospitalization in intensive care units. The average age of patients admitted to hospital is 57-79 years, with one third half with an underlying disease. Asymptomatic infections have also been described, but their frequency is not known. SARS-CoV-2 transmission is mainly airborne from one person to another via droplets. The data available so far seem to indicate that SARS-CoV-2 is capable of producing an excessive immune reaction in the host. The virus attacks type II pneumocytes in the lower bronchi through the binding of the Spike protein (S protein) to viral receptors, of which the angiotensin 2 conversion enzyme (ACE2) receptor is the most important. ACE2 receptor is widely expressed in numerous tissues, including the oropharynx and conjunctiva, but mostly distributed in ciliated bronchial epithelial cells and type II pneumocytes in the lower bronchi. The arrival of SARS-CoV-2 in the lungs causes severe primary interstitial viral pneumonia that can lead to the "cytokine storm syndrome", a deadly uncontrolled systemic inflammatory response triggered by the activation of interleukin 6 (IL-6), whose effect is extensive lung tissue damage and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), that are life-threatening for patients with COVID-19. In the absence of a therapy of proven efficacy, current management consists of off-label or compassionate use therapies based on antivirals, antiparasitic agents in both oral and parenteral formulation, anti-inflammatory drugs, oxygen therapy and heparin support and convalescent plasma. Like most respiratory viruses can function and replicate at low temperatures (i.e. 34-35 degrees C) and assuming viral thermolability of SARS-CoV-2, local instillation or aerosol of antiviral (i.e. remdesivir) in humid heat vaporization (40 degrees-41 degrees C) in the first phase of infection (phenotype I, before admission), both in asymptomatic but nasopharyngeal swab positive patients, together with antiseptic-antiviral oral gargles and povidone-iodine eye drops for conjunctiva (0,8-5% conjunctival congestion), would attack the virus directly through the receptors to which it binds, significantly decreasing viral replication, risk of evolution to phenotypes IV and V, reducing hospitalization and therefore death.									14	0	0	0	7	0	14			0306-9877	1532-2777		WOS:000669488400037	32562915

Biophys. Acta 977, 219-226; Odom and Bricker (1992) Biochemistry 31, 5616-5620]. In this paper, we report results from a systematic study of functional and structural consequences of N-terminal elongation and truncation of manganese stabilizing protein. Precursor manganese stabilizing protein is the unprocessed wild-type protein, which carries an N-terminal extension of 84 amino acids in the form of its chloroplastic signal peptide, Despite its increased size, this protein is able to reconstitute O-2 evolution activity to levels observed with the mature, processed protein, but it also binds nonspecifically to PSII. Truncation of wild-type manganese stabilizing protein by site-directed mutagenesis to remove three N-terminal amino acids, resulting in a mutant called DeltaG3M, causes no loss of activity reconstitution, but this protein also exhibits nonspecific binding. Further truncation of the wild-type protein by ten N-terminal amino acids, producing DeltaE10M, limits binding of manganese stabilizing protein to 1 mol/mol of photosystem II and decreases activity reconstitution to about 65% of that obtained with the wild-type protein. Because two copies of wild type normally bind to photosystem II, amino acids in the domain K-4-E-10 must be involved in the binding of one copy of manganese stabilizing protein to photosystem II. Spectroscopic analysis (CD and UV spectra) reveals that N-terminal elongation and deletion of manganese stabilizing protein influence its overall conformation, even though secondary structure content is not perturbed. Our data suggest that the solution structure of manganese stabilizing protein attains a more compact solution structure upon removal of N-terminal amino acids.									39	0	1	0	39	0	40			0006-2960			WOS:000174007100025	11851417

However, the catalytic efficiency of the nanozyme still needs to be improved so that it can meet the selectivity and stability requirements of accurate biomolecule analysis. Here, we presented structure defects of metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) as a tuning strategy to regulate the catalytic efficiency of artificial nanozymes and investigated the roles of defects on the catalytic activity of oxidase-like MOFs. Structural defects were introduced into a novel Co-containing zeolitic imidazolate framework with gradually loosened morphology (ZIF-L-Co) by doping cysteine (Cys). It was found that with the increase in defect degree, the properties of materials such as ascorbate oxidase-like, glutathione oxidase-like, and laccase-like were obviously enhanced by over 5, 2, and 3 times, respectively. In-depth structural investigations indicate that the doping of sulfur inducing structural defects which may destroy the equilibrium state between cobalt and nitrogen in 2-methylimidazole and distort the crystal lattice, thereby enhancing the adsorption of oxygen and thus promoting the oxidase-like activity. The ZIF-L-Co-10 mg with enhanced ascorbate oxidase- and laccase-like activity was loaded into a microreactor and integrated into an online electrochemical system (OECS) in the upstream of the detector. This nanozyme-based microreactor can completely remove ascorbic acid, dopamine, and 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid which are the main interference toward uric acid (UA) electrochemical measurement, and the ZIF-L-Co-10 mg Cys-based OECS system is capable of continuously capturing UA change in rat brain following ischemia-reperfusion injury. Structure defect tuning of ZIF-L-Co not only provides a new regulatory strategy for artificial nanozyme activity but also provides a critical chemical platform for the investigation of UA-related brain function and brain diseases.									2	0	0	0	1	0	2			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000718271300114	34723454

The sample was characterized by XRD, SEM, HRTEM, element mapping, XPS, UV vis spectrum, Raman spectra, Mott-Schottky and XPS valence band analysis to reveal its properties. Photocatalytic experiment exhibited that H-Bi0.5Y0.5VO4 exhibited a much superior activity than the P-Bi0.5Y0.5VO4 among overall water splitting. The enhanced twisting degree in hetero-Bi0.5Y0.5VO4 (H-Bi0.5Y0.5VO4), which reconstructed the internal electric field and thus promoting the photogenerated carriers migrating directionally to form the direct Z-scheme heterojunction, should be responsible for the improvement of the photocatalytic performances. Furthermore, it also contributed to the morphology edge formation, which could be another critical factor for improving the photocarriers separation efficiency after simulating the rules of charge distribution. Additionally, results also indicated that the co-catalysts Rh@Rh2O3 could unlock a new charge transfer channel in the procedure of photocatalytic overall water splitting.									19	4	0	0	2	0	19			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000517665200035

IrO2 and Pt/C inks were deposited by IJP over the membrane to fabricate anode and cathode electrodes, respectively. Optical microscopy, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) were used for ex-situ surface and thickness characterization of the anode catalyst layer (CL). SEM images show the CL is uniform and well adhered to the membrane. EDX images show even distribution of the catalyst and ionomer in the CL. Hydrogen cross-over, cyclic voltammetry (CV) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) tests were performed to estimate hydrogen cross-over, double layer capacitance (Gil) and cell resistances. Cross-over results show that the membrane is not damaged during printing. A kinetic study revealed Tafel slopes similar to those in literature. Electrochemical performance tests showed that inkjet printed electrolyzer CCMs achieved 1 and 2 A/cm(2) current densities at average potentials of 1609 mV and 1696 mV (NRE211) and average of 1743 mV and 1977 mV (N117) respectively. The electrolyzer performance improved slightly when the printing piezo-voltage decreased but with a cost of higher fabrication time. The stability of the electrode was inline with literature data. The proposed electrodes outperform most of the previously reported electrolyzer data in the literature using commercial IrO2 catalyst. (C) The Author(s) 2018.

In the present study, two isoforms of LBP/BPI genes (designated as AjLBP/BPI1 and AjLBP/BPI2, respectively) were cloned from the sea cucumber Apostichopus japonicus by RACE approach. The full-length cDNAs of AjLBP/BPI1 and AjLBP/BPI2 were of 1479 and 1455 bp and encoded two secreted proteins of 492 and 484 amino acid residues, respectively. Signal peptide, two BPI/LBP/CETP and one central domain were totally conserved in the deduced amino acid of AjLBP/BPI1 and AjLBP/BPI2. Phylogentic analysis further supported that AjLBP/BPI1 and AjLBP/BPI2 belonged to new members of invertebrates LBP/BPI family. Spatial expression analysis revealed that both AjLBP/BPI1 and AjLBP/BPI2 were ubiquitously expressed in all examined tissues with the larger magnitude in AjLBP/BPI1. The Vibrio splenfidus challenge and LPS stimulation could significantly up-regulate the mRNA expression of both AjLBP/BPI1 and AjLBP/BPI2, with the increase of AjLBP/BPI2 expression occurred earlier than that of AjLBP/BPIL More importantly, we found that LPS induced ROS production was markedly depressed after AjLBP/BPI1 knock-down, but there was no significant change by AjLBP/BPI2 silencing. Consistently, the expression level of unclassified AjToll, not AjTIR3, was tightly correlated with that of AjLBP/BPI1. Silencing the AjToll also depressed the ROS production in the cultured coelomocytes. All these results indicated that AjLBP/BPI1 and AjLBP/BPI2 probably played distinct roles in bacterial mediating immune response in sea cucumber, and AjLBP/BPI1 depressed coelomocytes ROS production via modulating AjToll cascade.

Life cycle involves vegetative proliferation within the host, by which a cell named trophozoite undergoes successive bipartitioning. Other stages have been observed in vitro or in vivo, depending on the species: hypnospore, zoosporangium and zoospore. Molecular taxonomy supports a close affinity between dinoflagellates and Perkinsus spp. Six species of Perkinsus are currently considered valid: P. marinus, P. olseni, P. qugwadi, P. chesapeaki, P. andrewsi and P. mediterraneus. Histology and, above all, incubation of host tissues in Ray's fluid thioglycollate medium (RFTM) are classic diagnostic methods. In addition, more sensitive and quicker molecular diagnostic techniques based on either immunoassays or PCR have been developed for Perkinsus spp. Epizootiological studies have shown a marked influence of water temperature and salinity on P. marinus infection in oysters Crassostrea virginica, thus determining parasite geographical range and temporal disease dynamics (seasonality). In vitro cultures have been established for four Perkinsus spp. Immune response to infection varies depending on host and involves phagocytosis or encapsulation of the parasite cells by host haemocytes. A polypeptide is secreted by clam Tapes philippinarum haemocytes that could kill the parasite. In vitro cultured P. marinus cells secrete proteases that are likely involved in degradation of host tissues. P. marinus can suppress the toxic oxygen radicals produced by host haemocytes. In addition to host death, sublethal effects caused by Perkinsus spp. (reduction of fecundity, growth, and condition) may have significant ecological and economic implications. Various strategies have been assayed to mitigate the consequences of P marinus epizootics on the oyster industry: modifications of management/culture procedures, selective breeding to obtain resistant oyster strains, and the use of triploid oysters and allochthonous oyster species. Some chemotherapeutants have been proved to inhibit or kill parasite cells in vitro.									242	4	0	0	220	6	248			0990-7440	1765-2952		WOS:000226165000003

The molecular mechanisms underlying fish response to hypoxia have become a subject of great concern in recent years. In the present study, we performed transcriptome analysis of spleen and head kidney tissues from large yellow croaker (Larimichthys crocea) at 6 h, 24 h and 48 h after hypoxia challenge. A total of 2,499 and 3,685 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were obtained in spleen and head kidney, respectively. The expression changes of 10 selected genes in each tissue were further validated by quantitative real-time PCR. Gene ontology and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes enrichments revealed that numerous DEGs were immune genes, involved in multiple immune-relevant pathways. In spleen, several pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), including Toll-like receptors (TLR1, TLR2.1, TLR2-2, TLR5 and TLR8), Fucolectins (FUCL1, FUCL4 and FUCL5) and macrophage mannose receptor (MRC1), were significantly down-regulated, suggesting that the immune processes mediated by these PRRs may be suppressed by hypoxia stress. However, some PRRs (FUCL4, FUCL5 and MRC1) and other innate immunity genes, such as C-type lectin domain gene family members, chemokines, chemokine receptors and complement components were up-regulated in head kidney, which may be due to the increases in phagocytosis and cytokine secretion by macrophages after hypoxic stimulus. The expression of genes involved in B cell receptor signaling pathway, Natural killer cell-mediated cytotoxicity and NF-kappa B signaling pathway decreased rapidly, but regained normal or increased over time, suggesting an early adjustment pattern of fish immune response to cope with hypoxia stress. Moreover, the anaerobic ATP-generating pathway was activated and energy consumption processes were repressed concurrently in both spleen and head kidney. These data provide valuable information for understanding the tissue-specific and temporal changes of immune gene expression in hypoxic large yellow croakers.									14	2	0	0	13	0	16			1050-4648	1095-9947		WOS:000516880900078	31730929

These nanomaterials were characterized for structural, functional groups and morphological studies using XRD, FTIR and SEM respectively. The photocatalytic activity of the catalysts was assessed through photodegradation of methylene blue (MB) dye. The photocatalytic studies reveal that the ZnO/NiFe2O4 nanocomposite exhibits high degradation efficiency under UV light. The study shows that in the removal of MB solution by ZnO/NiFe2O4 nanoparticles, (OH)-O-center dot and photoproduced holes h(+) are the main species. Preparation of ZnO/NiFe2O4 nanocomposite by coupling of NiFe2O4 with green synthesized ZnO in solid state method is the novelty of this report. The synthesized recyclable ZnO/NiFe2O4 nanocomposite has potential applications in the treatment of both domestic and industrial waste water.					2nd International Workshop on Advances on Photocatalysis (AdvPhotoCat-E)2nd International Workshop on Advances on Photocatalysis (AdvPhotoCat-E)	JUL 14-16, 2017JUL 14-16, 2017		Technol Educ Inst Crete, Heraklion, GREECETechnol Educ Inst Crete, Heraklion, GREECE	159	7	0	0	18	2	161			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000438578700023

However, the interfacial charge transfer and recombination greatly limits its activity for photoelectrochemical water splitting. Carbon dots exhibit great potential in photoelectrochemical water splitting for solar to hydrogen conversion as photosensitisers and co-catalysts. Here we developed a novel carbon underlayer from low-cost and environmental-friendly carbon dots through a facile hydrothermal process, introduced between the fluorine-doped tin oxide conducting substrate and hematite photoanodes. This led to a remarkable enhancement in the photocurrent density. Owing to the triple functional role of carbon dots underlayer in improving the interfacial properties of FTO/hematite and providing carbon source for the overlayer as well as the change in the iron oxidation state, the bulk and interfacial charge transfer dynamics of hematite are significantly enhanced, and consequently led to a remarkable enhancement in the photocurrent density. The results revealed a substantial improvement in the charge transfer rate, yielding a charge transfer efficiency of up to 80% at 1.25 Vvs.RHE. In addition, a significant enhancement in the lifetime of photogenerated electrons and an increased carrier density were observed for the hematite photoanodes modified with a carbon underlayer, confirming that the use of sustainable carbon nanomaterials is an effective strategy to boost the photoelectrochemical performance of semiconductors for energy conversion.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000579877200010	33000831

However high prices of platinum and iridium, currently considered to be the state-of-the-art electrocatalysts, prevent wider commercialization of this technology. In this paper, we present unconventional and cost-effective preparation method of anode catalyst, containing low amount of noble metal. Thin Ir film is magnetron sputtered on TiC-based support sublayer, hot-pressed on anode side of Nafione (R) N115 PEM. Following three parameters were systematically varied and their impact on PEMWE in-cell performance was evaluated: total TiC-based support material loading on the PEM, ionomer content within the support sublayer and Ir catalyst loading on top of the support sublayer. In addition, TiC-based sublayer underwent accelerated aging procedure, followed by photoelectron spectral analysis to prove its ability to withstand high anodic potentials. Remarkable PEMWE in-cell performances were obtained, considering amount of used Ir; 1.74 V (with similar to 80 mu g cm(-2) of Ir), 1.72 V (with similar to 160 mu g cm(-2) of Ir) and 1.71 V (with similar to 240 mu g cm(-2) of Ir) at 1 A cm(-2) and 80 degrees C.

Nitrogen fixation takes place in heterocysts that differentiate as a result of nitrogen starvation. Heterocysts uphold a microoxic environment to avoid inactivation of nitrogenase, e.g. by downregulation of oxygenic photosynthesis. The ATP and reductant requirement for the nitrogenase reaction is considered to depend on Photosystem I, but little is known about the organization of energy converting membrane proteins in heterocysts. We have investigated the membrane proteome of heterocysts from nitrogen fixing filaments of Nostoc punctiforme sp. PCC 73102, by 2D gel electrophoresis and mass spectrometry. The membrane proteome was found to be dominated by the Photosystem I and ATP-synthase complexes. We could identify a significant amount of assembled Photosystem II complexes containing the D1, D2, CP43, CP47 and PsbO proteins from these complexes. We could also measure light-driven in vitro electron transfer from Photosystem II in heterocyst thylakoid membranes. We did not find any partially disassembled Photosystem II complexes lacking the CP43 protein. Several subunits of the NDH-1 complex were also identified. The relative amount of NDH-1M complexes was found to be higher than NDH-1L complexes, which might suggest a role for this complex in cyclic electron transfer in the heterocysts of Nostoc punctiforme.

In the work, we prepared K+-doped g-C3N4 (KCN) by thermal copolymerization, and combined it with WO3 nanoparticles by a facile deposition method to obtain the final photocatalytic composite KCN/WO3. XRD, FT-IR, XPS, TEM, SEM, UV-Vis and EIS were used to characterize the obtained samples. The results of EIS, UV-Vis and XPS valence band spectrum indicated the K+ doping effectively promoted charge separation of g-C3N4 and the valence band position of the KCN/WO3 composite obviously shifted higher potential, which greatly enhanced photocatalytic production of H2O2 and made the composite can produce H2O2 at the level of mmol/L without bubbling O2. The KCN10/WO3 (10%) composite showed the maximum photocatalytic activity. The decomposition behavior of H2O2 and recycled stability of KCN10/WO3 (10%) were also investigated. Furthermore, a plausible mechanism of photocatalytic production of H2O2 for KCN10/WO3 (10%) was also proposed based on reactive radicals trapped experiment and quantitatively determined experiment of superoxide radicals ( O2- ) and hydroxyl radicals ( OH).									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0927-7757	1873-4359		WOS:000663694000006

This study showed that the anammox process deteriorated, with N-removal efficiencies rapidly decreasing from 87.2 to 45.7% when reactors were exposed to COD shocks of 1.12, 2.24 and 3.36 g L-1 (COD/N ratio 2, 4 and 6). Comprehensive assessments of water quality, microbial characteristics and isotope analysis were adopted to investigate anammox recovery. Operational performance took 8-20 days to recover; anammox relative abundance recovered after 20 days, based on the results of fluorescence in situ hybridisation and quantitative PCR; and the anammox pathway contributed to 80.0-91.5% of N-loss 40 days after COD shock terminated, based on the results of the isotope labelling experiment. Therefore, a complete recovery required 40 days. The isotope labelling method supplied a reliable reference for recovery assessment of anammox system in real-world applications.									3	2	0	0	4	0	5			1615-7591	1615-7605		WOS:000499416700002	31784829

This approach requires the development of appropriate photoelectrode materials and substrates, which are low-cost and applicable for the fabrication of large area electrodes. In this work, hematite photoelectrodes are grown by aerosol assisted chemical vapour deposition (AA-CVD) onto highly-conductive and bulk porous SnO2 (Sb-doped) ceramic substrates. For such photoelectrodes, the photocurrent density of 2.8 mA cm(-2) is achieved in aqueous 0.1 M NaOH under blue LED illumination (lambda = 455 nm; 198 mW cm(-2)) at 1.23 V vs. RHE (reversible hydrogen electrode). This relatively good photoelectrochemical performance of the photoelectrode is achieved despite the simple fabrication process. Good performance is suggested to be related to the three-dimensional morphology of the porous ceramic substrate resulting in excellent light-driven charge carrier harvesting. The porosity of the ceramic substrate allows growth of the photoactive layer (SnO2-grains covered by hematite) to a depth of some micrometers, whereas the thickness of Fe2O3-coating on individual grains is only about 100-150 nm. This architecture of the photoactive layer assures a good light absorption and it creates favourable conditions for charge separation and transport. (C) 2019 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC.

To perform the evaluation, a current-voltage model was employed, with the light absorbers, electrocatalysts, solution electrolyte, and membranes coupled in series, and with the directions of optical absorption, carrier transport, electron transfer and ionic transport in parallel. The current density vs. voltage characteristics of the light absorbers were determined by detailed-balance calculations that accounted for the Shockley-ueisser limit on the photovoltage of each absorber. The maximum STH efficiency for an integrated photoelectrochemical system was found to be similar to 31.1% at 1 Sun (=1 kWm(-2), air mass 1.5), fundamentally limited by a matching photocurrent density of 25.3 mA cm(-2) produced by the light absorbers. Choices of electrocatalysts, as well as the fill factors of the light absorbers and the Ohmic resistance of the solution electrolyte also play key roles in determining the maximum STH efficiency and the corresponding optimal tandem band gap combination. Pairing 1.6-1.8 eV band gap semiconductors with Si in a tandem structure produces promising light absorbers for water splitting, with theoretical STH efficiency limits of > 25%.									419	11	0	0	34	0	421			1754-5692	1754-5706		WOS:000325765100022

It has been suggested that bicarbonate binds to the non-heme iron and the Q(B) binding niche of the PS II reaction center. To investigate the potential amino acid binding environment of bicarbonate, an arginine residue (R269) of the D1 protein of PS II of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii was mutated into a glycine; our characterization of the resultant mutant (D1-R269G) shows that both the Tyr(D)(+) and Q(A)(-) Fe2+ EPR signals are substantially reduced and assembly of the tetranuclear Mn is lost (R.S. Hutchison, J. Xiong, R.T. Sayre, Govindjee, Biochim. Biophys. Acta 1277 (1996) 83-92). In order to understand the molecular implications of this mutation on the electron acceptor side of PS II, we used chlorophyll (Chl) a fluorescence as a probe of PS II structure and function, and herbicide binding as a probe for changes in the Q(B) binding niche of PS II. Chl fluorescence measurements with the heterotrophically grown D1-R269G mutant cells (or thylakoids), as compared to that of the wild type, show that: rate of electron transfer from Q(A)(-) to the plastoquinone pool, measured by flash-induced Chl a fluorescence decay kinetics, is reduced by similar to 17 fold; the minimum Chi a fluorescence yield when all Q(A)(-) is oxidized, is elevated by 2 fold; the level of stable charge separation as inferred from variable Chi fluorescence is reduced by 44%; binary oscillation pattern of variable Chl a fluorescence obtained after a series of light flashes is absent, indicative of the loss of functioning of the two-electron gate on the PS II acceptor side; 77 K PS II Chl a fluorescence emission bands (F685 and F695) are reduced by 20-30% (assuming no change in the PS I emission band). Thermoluminescence data with thylakoids show the absence of the S(2)Q(A)(-) and S(2)Q(B)(-) bands in the mutant.

Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) have emerged as a burgeoning family of organic materials internally connected by covalent bonds and have been explored as promising candidates in electrocatalysis. The reticular geometry of COFs can provide an excellent platform for precise incorporation of the active sites in the framework, and the fine-tuning hierarchical porous architectures can enable efficient accessibility of the active sites and mass transportation. Considerable advances are made in rational design and controllable fabrication of COF-based organic-inorganic hybrids, that containing organic frameworks and inorganic electroactive species to induce novel physicochemical properties, and take advantage of the synergistic effect for targeted electrocatalysis with the hybrid system. Branches of COF-based hybrids containing a diversity form of metals, metal compounds, as well as metal-free carbons have come to the fore as highly promising electrocatalysts. This review aims to provide a systematic and profound understanding of the design principles behind the COF-based hybrids for electrocatalysis applications. Particularly, the structure-activity relationship and the synergistic effects in the COF-based hybrid systems are discussed to shed some light on the future design of next-generation electrocatalysts.									7	0	0	0	0	0	7			2366-9608			WOS:000711732900001	34928017

After the addition of ionic liquids, the structural change of hmCN increases the separation of photogenerated electron holes and improves the photocatalytic performance. The colorless pollutant bisphenol A (BPA) is degraded as the target pollutant under the visible light irradiation. The catalytic performance of g-C3N4 modified by ionic liquid is better than pure g-C3N4. The best performance is 30hm-CN, which degrades 95% of the pollutants in 3 hours. Its degradation performance is 4.5 times that of pure g-C3N4 and the degradation performance is still excellent after three cycles. According to electron spin resonance (ESR) and trapping experiments, h(+) and center dot O-2(-) play a key role in the photocatalytic degradation process. In addition, we conducted a series of condition experiments to perform degradation under different catalyst concentrations, different ions and different pH to fully understand the impact of external interference on the catalyst. At the same time, the sample also has good activity in degrading other pollutants (Rhodamine B, Methylene blue, Tetracycline, Ciprofloxacin). This study simply designed a method to synthesize ionic liquid modified g-C3N4 for improving photocatalytic performance, and provided a new idea for the research of carbon nitride modification at the same time.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			0927-7757	1873-4359		WOS:000605533000003

However, the synthesis of organosiloxanes catalyzed by these enzymes has thus far remained largely unexplored. To investigate the reactivity of these enzymes in relation to this important class of compounds, their catalysis of Si-O bond hydrolysis and condensation was investigated with a range of model organosilanols and silyl ethers. The enzymes' kinetic parameters were obtained by a high-throughput colorimetric assay based on the hydrolysis of 4-nitrophenyl silyl ethers. These assays showed unambiguous catalysis with k(cat)/K-m values on the order of 2-50 min(-1) mu M-1. Condensation reactions were also demonstrated by the generation of silyl ethers from their corresponding silanols and alcohols. Notably, when presented with a substrate bearing both aliphatic and aromatic hydroxy groups the enzyme preferentially silylates the latter group, in clear contrast to nonenzymatic silylations. Furthermore, the silicateins are able to catalyze trans-etherifications, where the silyl group from one silyl ether may be transferred to a recipient alcohol. Despite close sequence homology to the protease cathepsin L, the silicateins seem to exhibit no significant protease or esterase activity when tested against analogous substrates. Overall, these results suggest the silicateins are promising candidates for future elaboration into efficient and selective biocatalysts for organosiloxane chemistry.									18	0	0	0	7	0	18			0027-8424			WOS:000404576100004	28630316

Herein, an effective strategy based on synergetic effect of selected multiple metal ions is designed for P2-type cathodes with improved performance. The role of tetravalent titanium provides high redox potential, inactive divalent magnesium stabilizes the structure, and the monovalent lithium smooths the electrochemical curves. The combined analysis of in operando X-ray diffraction, in operando X-ray absorption spectroscopy and density functional theory calculations demonstrates the contribution of multi-metal ions converts the unfavorable and large-volume P2 to O2 transition into a moderate "Z"-intergrowth structure by increasing the energy barrier of transition metal slab gliding. As a consequence, the resultant P2-Na0.7Li0.03Mg0.03Ni0.27Mn0.6Ti0.07O2 electrode delivers a reversible capacity of 134 mAh g(-1), a working voltage of 3.57 V, excellent cycling stability (82% of capacity retention after 200 cycles), and superior rate performance (110 mAh g(-1) at 4 C). Full cells fabricated with a hard carbon anode achieve an energy density of 296 Wh kg(-1). This study presents a route to rationally design cathode materials with this functionalization to improve the cell performance for sodium-ion batteries.									11	0	0	0	0	0	11			1614-6832	1614-6840		WOS:000758160400001

Herein, a novel Zscheme photocatalyst Ag3PO4/Co-3(PO4)(2)@Ag was successfully synthesized, which has the distinctive three dimensional (3D) structure with the Ag3PO4 rhombic dodecahedrons on the flower-like Co-3(PO4)(2). The ternary Ag3PO4/Co-3(PO4)(2)@Ag heterostructure photocatalyst exhibits the highest photocatalytic activity in comparison with Ag3PO4, Co-3(PO4)(2) and Ag3PO4/Co-3(PO4)(2), which can be up to 91.2% at 60 min for the degradation of tetracycline (TC) under visible light irradiation. This enhanced photocatalytic performance is attributed to the surface plasmon resonance (SPR) of Ag to effectively broaden the absorption of visible light in composites, which is proved by the finite-difference time domain (FDTD) simulation. Moreover, the results of electron spin resonance (ESR) confirmed that the introduction of Ag nanoparticles can further facilitate the charge transfer of heterostructure Ag3PO4/Co-3(PO4)(2) through the route of the Z-scheme, fully retaining prominent redox ability of Ag3PO4 and Co-3(PO4)(2).

Intriguing electronic coupling, lowered energy barrier, intimate charge transfer, and efficient exciton separation occurring at the atomically sharp interface promise their applications in catalysis, which, however, are largely unexplored. Herein, we demonstrate a OD/2D vdWH between OD graphene quantum dots (GQDs) and 2D pristine graphene sheets, simply prepared by ultrasonication of graphite powder using GQDs as intercalation surfactant. Such an all-carbon Schottky-diode-like OD/2D vdWH is employed for the emerging photoelectrochemical catalysis (water splitting) with high performance. The demonstrated low-cost and scalable bottom-up growth of heteroatom-doped GQDs will greatly promote their widespread applications. Moreover, the mechanisms underlying GQD growth and heterojunction-mediated catalysis are revealed both experimentally and theoretically.									56	3	0	0	8	0	57			1936-0851	1936-086X		WOS:000510531500108	31934740

Even though numerous achievements have been made, the photocatalytic systems developed to date are still far from practical applications due to the low efficiency and poor durability. Efficient light absorption and charge separation are two of the key factors for the exploration of high performance photocatalytic systems, which is generally difficult to be obtained in a single photocatalyst. The combination of various materials to form heterojunctions provides an effective way to better harvest solar energy and to facilitate charge separation and transfer, thus enhancing the photocatalytic activity and stability. This review concisely summarizes the recent development of visible light responsive heterojunctions, including the preparation and performances of semiconductor/semiconductor junctions, semiconductor/cocatalyst junctions, semiconductor/metal junctions, semiconductor/nonmetal junctions, and surface heterojunctions, and their mechanism for enhanced light harvesting and charge separation/transfer.

Recently, uniform and highly crystalline monolayer MoS2 was grown through chemical vapor deposition (CVD) using seed materials as a growth promoter. However, residual seed materials can remain on the surface of a monolayer MoS2 flake on a SiO2/Si substrate after growth. Here, we observe drastically increased photoluminescence (PL) intensity at the edge of MoS2 flake where residual particles are attached after repeated laser irradiation. On the other hand, the PL intensity of pure MoS2 remained almost the same. We attribute this to the effect of p-doping of the edge MoS2 by the adsorbed H2O and O-2 molecules in the residual particles. The p-doping effect of MoS2 is confirmed by the confocal PL and Raman spectroscopy analysis. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

The approach, also known as an elevated water table (EWT), is a promising alternative to full water covers for the management and closure of sulfidic tailings impoundments and for the long term control of acid mine drainage. The instrumented columns contained reactive tailings from the Louvicourt mine, Quebec, and were overlain by a protective sand cover. Over a 13-19 month period, the columns were exposed to atmospheric O-2 and flushed approximately every month with demineralized water. A free draining control column with no sand cover was also used. During each cycle, water table elevations were controlled by fixing the pressure at the column base and drainage water was collected and analyzed for pH and Eh, major ions, and dissolved metals (Fe, Zn, Cu, Pb, and Mg). The columns were simulated using the multicomponent reactive transport model MIN3P which solves the coupled nonlinear equations for transient water flow, O-2 diffusion, advective-dispersive transport and kinetic geochemical reactions. Physical properties and mineralogical compositions for the material layers were obtained from independent laboratory data. The simulated and observed data showed that as the water table elevation increased, the effluent pH became more neutral and SO4 and dissolved metal concentrations decreased by factors on the order of 10(2)-10(3). It is concluded that water table depths less than or equal to one-half of the air entry value (AEV) can keep mine tailings sufficiently saturated over the long term, thus reducing sulfide oxidation and AMD production.

We show that, as in cyanobacteria, an interaction between Q(A) and Q(B) iron-semiquinones (Q(A)--Fe2+-Q(B)-) is observed which gives an EPR signal near g = 1.6. Bicarbonate binding close to the non-haem iron is required to observe this interaction. The EPR signal of Q(B) semiquinone is weak and difficult to distinguish from that of Q(A). The appearance of the g = 1.6 signal from Q(A)--Fe2+-Q(B)- after 77 K illumination is a better marker for the presence of Q(B) semiquinone. The yield of Q(B) semiquinone in plant PS II is lower than found in cyanobacteria. The brominated quinones DBMIB, TBTQ and bromanil were used as Q(B) analogues to increase the yield of Q(A)--Fe2+-Q(B)-. These analogues act by forming a stable semiquinone at the Q(B) site and not by covalent binding.									25	0	0	0	21	0	25			0006-3002			WOS:A1991GE27300007

In solution, and in the re-dissolved glass, kinetics were dominated by two fast components with lifetimes in the range of 2-7 mu s, which accounted for >85% of the decay. These components were ascribed to the direct electron transfer from the redox-active tyrosine YZ to P-680(center dot+). The minor slower components were due to charge recombination between the primary plastoquinone acceptor QA(center dot+) and P-680(center dot+). Incorporation of the PS II complex into the trehalose glassy matrix and its successive dehydration caused a progressive increase in the lifetime of all kinetic phases, accompanied by an increase of the amplitudes of the slower phases at the expense of the faster phases. At 63% relative humidity the fast components contribution dropped to similar to 50%. A further dehydration of the trehalose glass did not change the lifetimes and contribution of the kinetic components. This effect was ascribed to the decrease of conformational mobility of the protein domain between Y-Z and P-680, which resulted in the inhibition of Y-Z -> P-680(center dot+) electron transfer in about half of the PS II population, wherein the recombination between QA(center dot+) and P-680(center dot+) occurred. The data indicate that PS II binds a larger number of water molecules as compared to PS I complexes. We conclude that our data disprove the "water replacement" hypothesis of trehalose matrix biopreservation.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			0005-2728	1879-2650		WOS:000647649800004	33716033

This work demonstrates the fabrication of a series of hierarchical macroporous mixed-phase TiO2 on the surface of B-doped g-C3N4 (BCN). The physicochemical properties such as crystallinity, morphology, chemical environment, and optical and electronic properties of the as-synthesized materials were analysed by using different analytical techniques. PXRD and HRTEM data revealed the growth of mixed-phase TiO2 (anatase and rutile) on the BCN surface, mimicking P25 in the case of the best photocatalyst (TBCN-8). The catalytic activity of the as-synthesized materials was tested towards H2O2 production (110 mu mol h(-1)) and phenol oxidation (87% of 20 ppm phenol solution) under visible light. Higher photocurrent, lower impedance arc, and lower PL intensity suggest a lower electron-hole recombination rate in the case of TBCN-8, elucidating the best catalytic performance by the material. This work validates the facile fabrication of macroporous TiO2/BCN nanocomposites and their visible-light-driven catalytic activity based on both the p-n heterojunction and Z-scheme mechanism.									21	0	0	0	0	0	21			2052-1553			WOS:000631626000010

The distinctive sensing performance of cobalt ion in LaBO3 perovskite (B = Fe, Mn, Ni, or Cr) for hydrazine electrooxidation								JOURNAL OF ELECTROANALYTICAL CHEMISTRY				851						113443	10.1016/j.jelechem.2019.113443				OCT 10 2019	2019	A single phase rhombohedral LaCoO3 perovskite is prepared by the microwave-assistant citrate method. The as-synthesized perovskite is applied as a facile sensor for hydrazine determination in aqueous 1 M KOH by using electrochemical techniques such as cyclic voltammetry (CV), chronoamperometry (CA), and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). The cyclic volyammogram of LaCoO3 modified glassy carbon electrode (GC/LaCoO3) show a well-defined hydrazine oxidation peak of a current, I-p, equals 1.71 mA.cm(-2) at an oxidation peak potential, E-p, of +518.8 mV vs. Ag/AgCI. On the other hand, no hydrazine oxidation is observed at modified GC electrodes with other lanthanum-transition metals perovskites, LaBO3 (B is Ni, Mn, Cr, or Fe). EIS data showed a reduction of the charge-transfer resistance value from 220.9 to 3.8 Omega . cm(2) by casting LaCoO3 on GC electrode surface, reflecting the powerful electrocatlaytic activity of LaCoO3 towards the hydrazine oxidation. The presented sensor has two linear responses over hydrazine concentration ranges 0.1-15 and 20-60 mM, with sensitivity values of 5.61 mA cm(-2). M-1 and limit of detection (LOD) value of 0.15 nM, respectively. The sensor exhibits a high stability, excellent reproducibility and accepted anti-interferences ability for various inorganic ions and organic compounds. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

However, severe mass transfer polarization loss resulting in fuel cell performance decline will be encountered in ultra-low Pt PEMFC. In this work, mild oxidized multiwalled carbon nanotubes (mMWCNT) were adopted to construct the catalyst layer, and by varying the loading of carbon nanotubes, the catalyst layer structure was optimized. A high peak power density of 1.23 W.cm(-2) for the MEA with mMWCNT was obtained at an ultra-low loading of 120 mu g.cm(-2) Pt/PtRu (both cathode and anode), which was 44.7% higher than that of MEA without inMWCNT. Better catalyst dispersion, low charge transfer resistance, more porous structure and high hydrophobicity of catalyst layer were ascribed for the reasons of the performance improvement.

Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) have emerged as frontier materials due to their unique porous organic-inorganic hybrid periodic assembly and exceptional diversity in structural properties and chemical functionalities. In particular, the modular nature and modularity-dependent activity of MOFs and MOF derivatives have accentuated the delicate atomic- and molecular design and synthesis of MOFs, and their meticulous conversion into carbons and transition-metal-based materials. Synthetic control over framework architecture, content, and reactivity has led to unprecedented merits relevant to various energy and environmental applications. Herein, an overview of the atomic- and molecular-design strategies of MOFs to realize application-targeted properties is provided. Recent progress on the development of MOFs and MOF derivatives based on these strategies, along with their performance, is summarized with a special emphasis on design-structure and functionality-activity relation- ships. Next, the respective energy- and environmental-related applications of catalysis and energy storage, as well as gas storage-separation and water harvesting with close association to the energy-water-environment nexus are highlighted.

It was observed that sandblasting influences the surface morphology both before and after coating as deeper and smaller etching pits are obtained on the substrate before coating process and rougher surface is obtained after coating. As a result larger outer electrochemical active surface area (ECSA) is obtained on the anodes with sandblasting, which was determined based on cyclic voltammetry, whereas the inner ECSA is independent of the pretreatment. The polarization measurements in a quasi-steady state reveal that sandblasting has slight influence on the catalytic activity. Accelerated lifetime tests were carried out in acidic 0.9 mol L-1 Na2SO4 solution (pH = 2) at a current density of 5 x 10(7) A cm(-2) under galvanostatic conditions. It shows that sandblasting would shorten the lifetime of the anode due to oxidation of the titanium substrate. This is suggested to be due to the shorter distance between the lowest spot of the outer coating surface and the highest spot of the outer substrate of the anode after applying sandblasting in titanium substrate pretreatment.

Herein, Ni-P alloy is controllably anchored onto the surface of defect-rich ZnS (DR-ZnS) nanospheres through in-situ photodeposition strategy. The optimized Ni-P/DR-ZnS nanocomposite displays superior visible-light photocatalytic H2 production rate (69.92 mu mol h(-1)), which is about 29 times and 3.6 times higher than that of the bare DR-ZnS and 1 wt% Pt/DR-ZnS, respectively, and a notable apparent quantum yield of 2.4 % at 420 nm. The existence of rich defects endows the DR-ZnS with visible-light absorption capability. The constructed Schottky junction between the Ni-P alloy and DR-ZnS accelerates the transfer of photogenerated electrons from DR-ZnS to Ni-P, thus boosting the photocatalytic performance. Moreover, the charge transfer process and underlying photocatalytic mechanism are unravelled by multiple in-depth characterizations. This research sheds novel light on rationally fabricating high-efficient and low-cost photocatalysts through integrating defect engineering and Schottky junction design.									40	2	0	0	4	0	40			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000532683200052

Pyrite nickel disulfide (NiS2) and nickel diselenide (NiSe2) as electrocatalysts have been extensively researched, but controllable component and superior structure for them are still a huge challenge. For this work, we report a series of flower-like electrocatalysts with Ni(SxSe1-x)(2) nanoparticles encapsulated by porous graphitized carbon nanosheets (PGCNS) through regulating molar ratio of S/Se, and reveal ultra-sensitive S/Se speciesinduced behaviors and the enhanced inherent electrocatalytic activity. The electrocatalytic activities of these anion-tuned sulfoselenides nanoparticles for both HER and OER can be further enhanced by insertion these nanoparticles into PGCNS. By virtue of the most rational doping and the unique architecture, Ni (S0.61Se0.39)(2)@PGCNS shows the remarkable HER activity While Ni(S0.24Se0.76)(2)@PGCNS exhibits the excellent OER activity. When these two electrocatalysts with outstanding performance are assembled in a typical two-electrodes system (Ni(S0.61Se0.39)(2)@PGCNS parallel to Ni(S0.24Se0.76)(2)@PGCNS) for overall water splitting in 1 M KOH, a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) is generated at a low cell potential of 1.54 V. This work emphasizes the significances of anion doping and unique architecture to enhance the activities for electrocatalytic water splitting in energy conversion. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc.

It was proposed that the well-developed combined interface between CdS-TGA and g-C3N4 was formed in CdS-TGA/g-C3N4 and consequently improved the stability and separation of the photo-generated charge carriers. As a result, the CdS-TGA/g-C3N4 exhibited significantly enhanced activity for the visible-light photocatalytic degradation of sulfamethazine (SM2) as compared to CdS/g-C3N4. The O-2 center dot(-) was found to be the dominant active species for SM2 decomposition and the possible photocatalytic degradation pathway of SM2 over CdS-TGA/g-C3N4 was through sulfonate elimination. This work demonstrated rational design and preparation of CdS-based heterojunction composites via construction of well-combined interface, which could open up a new way for the development of efficient and stable visible-light photocatalysts.									19	0	0	0	4	0	19			1010-6030			WOS:000447567000004

The concept of P2X relies on (photo)electrolysis of earth-abundant molecules into value-added products. For practical utilization, engineering robust, active, albeit inexpensive (photo)electrocatalysts via industrially compatible technologies is indeed crucial. In this context, flame spray pyrolysis (FSP) stands as an emerging approach for one-step synthesis of ready-to-use (photo)electrocatalysts with production rates of Kg h(-1) in lab-scales. While features of FSP to engineer nanomaterials have been summarised, there is a need for more critical discussions on key factors, modulating properties of flame-made catalysts. Therefore, this review article will first provide an overview about the concept of the P2X and catalyst development strategies. Unique characteristic of flame-synthesized nano-catalysts including compositions, fractal morphologies, defects, and active sites will be then critically discussed. Furthermore, a potential of FSP as an electrode-assembly technique for one-step preparation of catalysts on gas diffusion layers for industry-relevant electrolyser testing will be presented. Finally, perspectives on challenges and opportunities of FSP for renewable energies will be raised. This will provide insights into the versatility and commercial viability of the FSP route for engineering novel nanostructured catalysts for renewable energy applications.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			1616-301X	1616-3028		WOS:000728563400001

However, the charge transfer mechanism is still ambiguous, and how to design the high-speed channel for interfacial charge transfer is still a big challenge. In the present work, the energy band structure and charge transfer of the MoS2/g-C3N4 heterojunction are studied systematically. MoS2/g-C3N4 heterojunction could be demonstrated to form a direct Z-scheme system via the analysis of the interfacial band bending. Regrettably, this heterojunction has a low tunneling possibility at the surface, seriously limiting the photocatalytic efficiency. To solve this problem, we try to build high-speed channel between the layers with suitable metal. We make a thorough inquiry of the interface of M-C3N4 and M-MoS2 heterojunctions (M=Ag, Al, Au, and Pt). Our results reveals that Ag could improve the recombination efficiency of the majority carriers at the interface, which could pretty explain the enhanced photoactivity for g-C3N4/Ag/MoS2 system found in experiments. More notably, both Schottky and tunneling barriers vanish at the Al-C3N4 interface, forming an ohmic contact, which predicts a higher performance for electron transport. So that aluminum with the more excellent performance and higher abundance is a promising candidate for sliver in the Z-scheme system.									8	2	0	0	0	0	9				2053-1591		WOS:000495688000004

Nonstoichiometric perovskite CaMnO3-delta nanomaterial for photocatalytic reduction of CO2								JOURNAL OF MATERIALS SCIENCE-MATERIALS IN ELECTRONICS				32	4			5165	5175		10.1007/s10854-021-05248-3		JAN 2021		FEB 2021	2021	Nanostructured perovskite oxides have emerged as a class of high-performance photocatalytic materials. In this study, the nonstoichiometric perovskite CaMnO3-delta nanomaterial is reported as a potential photocatalyst under IR and visible irradiation. The as-prepared sample was characterized by Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) method and the diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS). The CO2 photoreduction and methanol yield over CaMnO3-delta under both infrared and visible light irradiation as a function of irradiation time and photocatalyst concentration were investigated by chemical titration and the gas chromatographic analysis (GC-FID). The first and second harmonics of Nd:YAG laser with wavelengths of 1064 and 532 nm were used as the excitation source. After 20 min of 532 nm irradiation, the methanol yield for catalyst concentration of 0.6 g/lit exhibited the highest value (1138 mu mol/g), while the methanol started to degrade with the increase of irradiation time. We have shown that under visible and IR irradiations, the electron photoexcitation from the hybridized O-2p and Mn-3d e(g)up arrow 1 valance band to the Mn-3d e(g)up arrow 2 conduction band provided CO2 center dot delta- anion radicals which are required for CO2 photoreduction to methanol. This study makes the nonstoichiometric CaMnO3-delta a promising active catalytic material for CO2 photoreduction to methanol under IR and visible light irradiation.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0957-4522	1573-482X		WOS:000611469900004

Herein, the well-designed CuS nanocages covered by NiCo LDHs nanosheets with the optimal Ni/Co ratio of 1:2 (CuS NCs@Ni1Co2 LDHs) were successfully prepared for the first time through sulfidation coupled with a coordinated etching and precipitation (CEP) method. As a nano-electrocatalyst for glucose detection, CuS NCs@Ni1Co2 LDHs not only demonstrated the advantage of the unique structure with outstanding mass diffusion, but also promoted electrocatalytic activities accompanied with fast electron transfer. Furthermore, density functional theory (DFT) calculations disclosed that the coupling between CuS NCs and Ni1Co2 LDHs enabled the increased glucose absorption energy and the improved conductivity. Significantly, the CuS NCs@Ni1Co2 LDHs modified electrode exhibited superior electrocatalytic per-formance with the sensitivity as high as 2236.4 mu M mM(-1) cm(-2 )combined with an ultralow limit detection of 0.18 mu M, wide linear range (0.001-4.6 mM), and fast current response (1 s). Overall, the proposed electro-chemical sensors shed light on the favorable incorporation of 3D hollow TMSs and 2D LDHs for high-performance glucose monitoring.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000848657300003

Markedly, the olefin-linked COFs are usually superior in transfer of pi-conjugated electron powered by visible light albeit their construction is more challenging. Herein, two olefin-linked COFs were forged between 2,4,6-trimethyl-1,3,5-triazine (TMT) and 2,4,6-tris(4-formyl-phenyl)-1,3,5-triazine (TFPT) or 1,3,5-tris(4-formylphenyl)-benzene (TFPB) to afford TTO-COF or TBO-COF, respectively. Both of the olefin-linked COFs based on triazine are of good crystallinity, uniform micropores, and high specific surface areas, but of different morphologies, namely nanotubes and nanosheets. Compared to TBO-COF, TTO-COF nanotubes were constructed with two building blocks based on triazine, which could not only improve the planarity of a single layer but also cause closer stacking of layers in between. Therefore, TTO-COF nanotubes exhibit better photocatalytic performance and stability in the selective oxidation of organic sulfides into corresponding sulfoxides with O-2 powered by blue light. Mechanistic investigation evidence the formation of desired sulfoxides was shaped by both electron and energy transfer pathways over TTO-COF nanotubes. This work underlines the ascendancy of olefin-linked COFs inasmuch as they provide an effective platform to construct efficient and durable photo catalysts based on adaptable organic building blocks.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000782990900005

Many such systems consist of a photosensitizer, an H-2-evolving catalyst (HEC), and sacrificial electron donor often with an electron relay between photosensitizer and HEC. Colloidal platinum remains a popular HEC. We report here a novel, simple, and high yield synthesis of Pt nanoparticles (Pt NPs) associated with human heavy chain ferritin (Hfn). The formation of the Pt NPs capitalizes on Hfn's native catalysis of autoxidation of Fe(ii)(aq) (ferroxidase activity). Fe(ii) reduces Pt(ii) to Pt(0) and the rapid ferroxidase reaction produces FeO(OH), which associates with and stabilizes the incipient Pt NPs. This Pt/Fe-Hfn efficiently catalyzes photosensitized H-2 production when combined with Eosin Y (EY) as photosensitizer and triethanolamine (TEOA) as sacrificial electron donor. With white light irradiation turnover numbers of 300H(2) per Pt, 250H(2) per EY were achieved. A quantum yield of 18% for H-2 production was obtained with 550 nm irradiation. The fluorescence emission of EY is quenched by TEOA but not by Pt/Fe-Hfn. We propose that the photosensitized H-2 production from aqueous TEOA, EY, Pt/Fe-Hfn solution occurs via a reductive quenching pathway in which both the singlet and triplet excited states of EY are reduced by TEOA to the anion radical, EY-., which in turn transfers electrons to the Pt/Fe-Hfn HEC. Hfn is known to be a remarkably versatile scaffold for incorporation and stabilization of noble metal and semiconductor nanoparticles. Since both EY and Hfn are amenable to scale-up, we envision further refinements to and applications of this photosensitized H-2-generating system.									1	0	0	0	1	0	1				2046-2069		WOS:000514642400005	35497424

Here, we describe a prebiotically plausible environment that draws on the strengths of both scenarios: surface hydrothermal vents. We show how key feedstock molecules for prebiotic chemistry can be produced in abundance in shallow and surficial hydrothermal systems. We calculate the chemistry of volcanic gases feeding these vents over a range of pressures and basalt C/N/O contents. If ultra-reducing carbon-rich nitrogen-rich gases interact with subsurface water at a volcanic vent they result in 10-3-1M concentrations of diacetylene (C4H2), acetylene (C2H2), cyanoacetylene (HC3N), hydrogen cyanide (HCN), bisulfite (likely in the form of salts containing HSO3-), hydrogen sulfide (HS-) and soluble iron in vent water. One key feedstock molecule, cyanamide (CH2N2), is not formed in significant quantities within this scenario, suggesting that it may need to be delivered exogenously, or formed from hydrogen cyanide either via organometallic compounds, or by some as yet-unknown chemical synthesis. Given the likely ubiquity of surface hydrothermal vents on young, hot, terrestrial planets, these results identify a prebiotically plausible local geochemical environment, which is also amenable to future lab-based simulation.									26	0	0	0	14	0	26				2075-1729		WOS:000464136000002	30682803	
J	Luo, Jin; Ning, Xiaomei; Zhan, Liang; Zhou, Xiaosong								Facile construction of a fascinating Z-scheme AgI/Zn3V2O8 photocatalyst for the photocatalytic degradation of tetracycline under visible light irradiation								SEPARATION AND PURIFICATION TECHNOLOGY				255						117691	10.1016/j.seppur.2020.117691				JAN 15 2021	2021	Solar-driven photocatalytic degradation undoubtedly represents a hopeful, sustainable together with effective alternative wastewater decontamination technology, however, exploiting highly efficient visible-light-induced photocatalysts for sewage remediation still exists a great challenge. Herein, a fascinating and unique AgI/Zn(3)V(2)O(8)Z-scheme photocatalyst was rationally constructed by immobilizing AgI nanoparticles on the surface of flower-like Zn3V2O8 nanosheets using a facile precipitation approach. Multiple techniques were employed to uncover the structure, morphology, composition, optical and electrochemical properties of as-generated samples. As expected, the resultant AgI/Zn3V2O8 photocatalyst manifested greatly boosted the photocatalytic activity towards tetracycline (TC) degradation under visible light irradiation. Noticeably, the optimized AgI(20 wt %)/Zn3V2O8 photocatalyst displayed the largest removal efficiency of TC, which was around 2.1 and 2.5 folds higher than that of pristine Zn3V2O8 and AgI, separately. This improvement was due to the generated Z-scheme heterojunction between Zn3V2O8 and AgI with the intimate interfacial contact, which significantly promoting the spatial separation and migration efficiency of photoexcited charge carriers and maintaining the high redox potential at the same time. Furthermore, superoxide and hydroxyl radicals were identified as the main active species for TC degradation, and a possible degradation pathway of TC was also deduced. These findings may open a new avenue for reasonable design of high-efficiency Zn3V2O8-based Z-scheme heterojunction photocatalysts for the removal of antibiotics from wastewater.									54	1	0	0	8	0	54			1383-5866	1873-3794		WOS:000633045200006

NO3 is a common contaminant in shallow ground water in this area, whereas high concentrations of NH4- N (up to 39 mg/L) are present in deep ground water. N concentrations, N/Cl ratios, tracer-based apparent ground-water ages, N isotope data, and hydraulic gradients indicate that septic tank effluent is the primary source of NO3. N isotope data, N/Cl and N/C relations, H data, and hydraulic considerations point to a natural, sedimentary organic matter source for the high concentrations of NH4, and are inconsistent with an origin as septic tank N. Low recharge rates and flow velocities have largely restricted anthropogenic NO3 to isolated plumes within several meters of the water table. A variety of geochemical and isotopic data indicate that denitrification also affects NO3 gradients in the aquifer. Ground water in the La Pine aquifer evolves from oxic to increasingly reduced conditions. Suboxic conditions are achieved after about 15-30 y of transport below the water table. NO3 is denitrified near the oxic/suboxic boundary. Denitrification in the La Pine aquifer is characterized well at the aquifer scale with a redox boundary approach that inherently captures spatial variability in the distribution of electron donors.

J	Huang, Lulu; Liu, Wen; Hu, Jin; Xing, Xiaopeng								Exploring the Effects of a Doping Silver Atom on Anionic Gold Clusters' Reactivity with O-2								JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY A				125	46			9995	10005		10.1021/acs.jpca.1c06507				NOV 25 2021	2021	Reactivities of AgAun-1- (n = 3-10) with O-2 at a low temperature were studied using an instrument combining a magnetron sputter cluster source, a microflow reactor, and a time-of-flight mass spectrometer. Their reaction products as well as size-dependent kinetic rates were nearly identical to those of corresponding Au-n(-) (n = 3-10). Previous experiments showed that the Ag atom in AgAun-1- (n = 3-10) was fully or partially enclosed by the gold atoms. We studied the adsorption of O-2 on these reported structures using the B3LYP theory with relatively large basis sets. The theoretical results indicate that the adsorption sites as well as the adsorption energies of O-2 on AgAun-1- (n = 3-10) are nearly identical to those on the corresponding Au-n(-) (n = 3-10). The O-2 adsorption on a series of proposed isomers of AgAun-1- (denoted as Aun-1Ag-), in which the silver atom was on the protruding site, was explored using the same theoretical methods. The O-2 tends to bond with the protruding Ag atoms, and the binding energies are apparently higher than those on the corresponding Au-n(-) and AgAun-1-. The adsorption and activation of O-2 on Au-n(-), AgAun-1-, and Aun-1Ag- were correlated with their global electron detachment energies (VDEs) as well as the element types of the adsorption sites. Generally, low VDE values and silver sites facilitate the O-2 adsorption, and these two factors separately dominate in various cluster species. The revealed effects of a doping silver atom in small gold clusters are helpful to understand the role of the residual silver components in many nano gold catalysts.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			1089-5639	1520-5215		WOS:000752435700006	34784715

Samples were collected from shallow groundwater in research boreholes on two sites in the northern and southern parts of the Jordan Valley, adjacent to the Jordan River. Data is also compiled from previous published studies. Geochernical data (e.g., Br/Cl, Na/Cl and SO4/Cl ratios) and B, O, Sr and S isotopic compositions are used to define groundwater groups, to map their distribution in the Jordan valley, and to evaluate their origin. The combined geochemical tools enabled the delineation of three major sources of solutes that differentially affect the quality of groundwater in the Jordan Valley: (1) flow and mixing with hypersaline brines with high Br/Cl (> 2 x 10(-3)) and low Na/Cl (< 0.8) ratios; (2) dissolution of highly soluble salts (e.g., halite, gypsum) in the host sediments resulting in typically lower Br/Cl signal (< 2 x 10(-3)); and (3) recharge of anthropogenic effluents, primarily derived from evaporated agricultural return flow that has interacted (e.g., base-exchange reactions) with the overlying soil. It is shown that shallow saline groundwaters influenced by brine mixing exhibit a north-south variation in their Br/Cl and Na/Cl ratios. This chemical trend was observed also in hypersaline brines in the Jordan valley, which suggests a local mixing process between the water bodies. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Mendoza-Cruz, R.; Ascencio-Aguirre, F.								Oxidation of Co-based porous nanoparticles followed by HAADF/BF imaging								Microscopy and Microanalysis				27	suppl.1			2328	9		10.1017/S1431927621008370				2021	2021	Summary form only given. All the properties that nanoscale materials present are strongly dependent on their physical-chemical features, such as size, shape, structure, composition, ordering, assembly, etc., so the fundamental study of these characteristics enables the correlation with their displayed properties. In this regard, advances in scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) in high-angle annular dark-field (HAADF) and bright-field (BF) modes have boosted the structural characterization of nanoscale materials with sub-angstrom resolution. Particularly, the annular dark-field imaging has enabled the fast observation of materials' structural features taking advantage of the mass-thickness contrast. In transition-metal nanoparticles, such as iron, nickel, or cobalt, oxidation occurs when exposed to environmental conditions. An oxide layer is formed on the surface, and once it is formed, the metal core is further stabilized by this protective layer forming a core-shell configuration where the shell is typically a spinel oxide. In metal oxide systems, a phase with more metal content tends to be at the interior, while the phase with less content in metal grows on the surface. Hence, the study of the chemical and structural changes of nanoparticles is of paramount importance. Herein, the oxidation of porous Co1-xNixO nanoparticles is followed by STEM imaging. The growth of a spinel Co3O4-type phase layer on the particles' surface was induced by the interaction with the electron beam to study the oxidation evolution of preformed CoO-type nanoparticles. Co1-xNixO nanoparticles were produced from a Co(ac) precursor thermally decomposed to form nanoparticles with a diameter of ~50 nm.Corresponds to a low-magnification HAADF image of the as-synthesized nanoparticles. The HAADF imaging enabled observing these nanoparticles' porous structures, with cavities of less than 5 nm in diameter formed by gas release during growth in solution. Their morphology corresponded to truncated octahedrons which expose (111) and small (100) facets, with some monoatomic steps. The particles crystallized into a homogeneous rock-salt structure of CoO. A high-magnification image is presented. The chemical composition was calculated from energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS), corresponding to a Co-rich oxide. Oxidation of the CoO-type phase was induced by the interaction of these particles with the electron beam, enabling the observation of the chemical changes with atomic-level precision. It was observed that the growth of the spinel Co3O4 phase started at the particle surface. It possibly proceeds from the remaining oxygen in the microscope column and into the nanocavities, and the decomposition and segregation of the rock salt phase. However, this transformation was not observed in the cavities structure, suggestinga bubble-like structure of the nanoparticles. Furthermore, the chemical change was induced more rapidly at the corner sites of the nanoparticle than in the facets. The induced oxidation formed a core-shell configuration with a shell thickness of around 3-5 nm, which apparently became stable for the observation conditions.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1431-9276			INSPEC:20807494

Here, a hybrid material (polyoxometalate-based metal-organic framework (POMOF)/rGO) integrating POMOF and rGO is obtained via a simple one-pot approach. The as-prepared materials are used as electrochemical active materials to detect dopamine for the first time. It is shown that the hybridization results in a superior catalytic activity for oxidation of dopamine owing to the synergistic effect between POMOF and rGO, as well as favorable interaction of DA with CC network of the composite. The promoted electron transfer, as well as abundant active sites, open channels, and aromatic planes in the hybrid material produce a wider linear detection range of 1 x 10(-6) to 2 x 10(-4) M with the lower detection limit of 80.4 x 10(-9)M (S/N = 3). Moreover, the developed biosensor also exhibits favorable selectivity, reproducibility, and stability. As a non-noble metal catalyst constructing from function and structure-matched building blocks, the prepared POMOF/rGO hybrid material demonstrates its highly promising properties for dopamine detection and the result should promote the further development of POMOF-based sensors.									35	0	0	0	8	0	35			2196-7350			WOS:000401870500006

So far PWS research has mainly focused on the development of artificial photocatalytic hydrogen production systems for pure water. It is more practically attractive to create systems for seawater, i.e., to reduce the cost of hydrogen production and make better use of naturally occurring water resources. Herein, brookite, anatase, and rutile TiO2 nanoparticles are investigated as photocatalysts to explore the feasibility of such thought and have shown attractive hydrogen production performance under full solar spectrum without any sacrificial agent. It is worth noting that, brookite TiO2, has more suitable band gap position and excellent photoelectric properties compared with anatase and rutile TiO2, and has higher efficiency and stability in the process of hydrogen production. The photocatalytic hydrogen production rate of brookite TiO2 can reach up to 1,476 mu mol/g/h, the highest value reported for TiO2-based systems and most other photocatalysts in seawater splitting under full spectrum. As the Cl- ions in seawater go through a cycle of oxidation and reduction, no Cl-2 is detected in the solar hydrogen production from seawater.									9	0	0	0	0	0	9			1998-0124	1998-0000		WOS:000728481000001

In the present study, iPS cells were generated from human renal epithelial cells and were then differentiated into neurons. Cells in the iPS-cell group were maintained in stem cell medium. In contrast, cells in the iPS-neuron group were first maintained in neural induction medium and expansion medium containing ROCK inhibitors, and then cultivated in neuronal differentiation medium and neuronal maturation medium to induce the neural stem cells to differentiate into neurons. The expression of relevant markers was compared at different stages of differentiation. Immunofluorescence staining revealed that cells in the iPS-neuron group expressed the neural stem cell markers SOX1 and nestin on day 11 of induction, and neuronal markers TUBB3 and NeuN on day 21 of induction. Polymerase chain reaction results demonstrated that, compared with the iPS-cell group, TUBB3 gene expression in the iPS-neuron group was increased 15.6-fold. Further research revealed that, compared with the iPS-cell group, the gene expression and immunoreactivity of mu opioid receptor in the iPS-neuron group were significantly increased (38.3-fold and 5.7-fold, respectively), but those of kappa opioid receptor had only a slight change (1.33-fold and 1.57-fold increases, respectively). Together, these data indicate that human iPS cells can be induced into mu opioid receptor- and kappa opioid receptor-expressing neurons, and that they may be useful to simulate human opioid receptor function in vitro and explore the underlying mechanisms of human conditions.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1673-5374	1876-7958		WOS:000585772900009	33063716

FE-SEM and TEM images showed that the Co2CuS4 NPs with an average size of similar to 21 nm were anchored to NG nanosheets. The NG nanosheets provide a large surface area to reduce self-aggregation and confine the shape of the Co2CuS4 NPs for a highly conductive network to boost the charge transport properties of energy storage devices. Impressively, the synergetic Co2CuS4/NG composite showed a high specific capacitance of similar to 1005 F g(-1) at 1 A g(-1), excellent rate capability (770 F g(-1) at 50 A g(-1)), and outstanding stability (96.3% capacitance retention after 5000 cycles). The electrochemical performance of the Co2CuS4/NG composite was superior to that of monometallic CoS/NG, Cu2S/NG composite, pure Co2CuS4, and NG. An asymmetric supercapacitor device fabricated using the Co2CuS4/NG composite as the positive electrode material and NG as the negative electrode material illustrates the outstanding performance for practical energy storage devices. The asymmetric supercapacitor device delivers superb energy density (53.3 W h k g(-1)), high power density (similar to 10 936 W k g(-1) at 38.4 W h k g(-1)), and a long-cycle life (similar to 4000 times).									118	4	0	0	10	0	119			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000388211700034		
J	MOUBARAKMILAD, M; STEMLER, A								DOES RESIDUAL BICARBONATE ACCOUNT FOR RESIDUAL HILL ACTIVITY IN FORMATE-PRETREATED THYLAKOIDS								PHOTOSYNTHETICA				31	4			593	598						1995	1995	Membrane-bound bicarbonate is believed by some to act as an essential activator of photosystem 2 (PS2) electron transport. Formate and other inhibitory monovalent anions act by removing bound-bicarbonate. This belief relies to a great extent on the observation that formate (100 mM) pretreated thylakoids exhibit a non-proportionality between Hill activity (HAR) and chlorophyll (Chi) concentration when preirradiated with bright radiation in reaction mixture that contains only 5 mM formate. The non-linearity was attributed to a supposed loosening of residual bicarbonate still. present after formate treatment and which would be more abundant at higher Chi concentrations. In repeating this experiment, we observed an increase in HAR at higher Chi concentrations in preirradiated, but also in non-preirradiated samples, the latter were simply left in the dark for 3 min before measurements were made. Therefore, preirradiation is not needed to restore some HAR in formate pretreated samples; a 3 min wait in the electrode chamber at low formate concentration is sufficient to partially relieve the formate inhibition of PS2 activity. Moreover, HAR in samples preirradiated by weak radiation, or not preirradiated at all, was directly proportional to Chl concentration. We can attribute the increase in activity to a dissociation of bound formate, not necessarily to the effect of residual bicarbonate. Non-linearity in HAR with Chi concentration was found only in high-irradiance pretreated samples. We can attribute this to a greater amount of photoinhibition occurring in the dilute samples, where the effective irradiance was greater. There is no need to postulate the existence of residual bound bicarbonate to explain these results.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0300-3604			WOS:A1995TB77800012

In this respect, here diverse synthetic courses such as calcination (BiVO4-C), hydrothermal treatment (BiVO4-H), and a reflux method (BiVO4-R) are introduced to fabricate various hierarchical morphologies of highly crystalline monoclinic scheelite bismuth vanadate (BiVO4) with different redox facet exposure factors that have been well established by X-ray diffraction, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, field emission scanning electron microscopy, and transmission electron microscopy analysis. The analytical and experimental investigations revealed superior photocatalytic upshots of a BiVO4-R {040/110} facet isotype heterojunction toward levofloxacin (LVF) detoxification (71.2%, 120 min) and the water oxidation reaction (530.6 mu mol, 120 min) relative to BiVO4-C (42.3%, 434.2 mu mol) and BiVO4-H (60.4%, 494.8 mu mol). Accordingly, the BiVO4 -R {040/110} facet isotype heterojunction (145.6 mu A/cm(2)) expressed an enhanced photocurrent in comparison to pristine BiVO4-C (75.5 mu A/cm(2)) and BiVO4-H (113.1 mu A/cm(2)). The superior photocatalytic redox efficiency was attributed to well-exposed {040} reduction and {110} oxidation facets and a superior relative {040} facet exposure factor provoking an enhanced charge carrier separation over a BiVO4-R {040/110} facet isotype heterojunction. The spatial exciton separation over the BiVO4 -R sample was well established by numerous analytical and experimental investigations. The effectual associations among physicochemical, photoelectrochemical properties, {040/110} facet isotype heterojunction, relative reduction-oxidation facet exposure factor, and photocatalytic performances of fabricated BiVO4 microstructures were well established, and the upshots of this research were discussed finely. The research signifies an effectual direction for morphology and relative reduction-oxidation facet exposure factor controlled fabrication of facet isotype heterojunction based materials for superior photocatalysis and could be advantageous for supplementary research areas.									21	0	0	0	3	0	21			0020-1669	1520-510X		WOS:000552287100085	32584565

Hydrogen is recognized as an excellent new resource. However, the inherent hazard of combustion and explosion should not be ignored. In this paper, the formation of the under-expansion jet flame (UEJF) of premixed hydrogen/air in explosion venting was simulated by ANSYS Fluent, and the wave system structures of the UEJF were systematically analyzed. The changes of pressure, Mach number, and main gas mass fraction distribution in the formation of the UEJF structures were described. The results indicated that the pressure difference at the outlet of explosion venting tube induced the intersection of expansion wave and reflected wave, and the formation of an obvious negative pressure area in the flow field. Meanwhile, alternating changes of the pressure in the jet center area propagated forward with the flame, resulting in the generation of UEJF. The fluxion of airflow at the outlet of explosion venting tube can be regarded as Prandtl-Meyer flow. The expansion angle was a positive correlation to the Mach number and the pressure ratio of the internal and external of the explosion venting tube. The distribution of H2O, O-2, and -OH on the Mach disk revealed that the residual hydrogen reacted with O-2 to produce secondary or multiple explosions. Therefore, the attention and research on the hazard of the under-expansion jet field should be strengthened. (C) 2022 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

However, the catalytic effect of the reported materials is still unsatisfactory due to discrete electron transport, poor conductivity and limited active site. Herein, the nanoforest-like structure of CoNi@NC-NCNTs is fabricated by a facile carbonization-induced in situ growth strategy with nitrogen-doped carbon layer coated CoNi alloy nanowires (CoNi@NC) as trunks and intertwined nitrogen-doped carbon nanotubes as branches (NCNTs). The intertwined NCNTs grown on CoNi@NC nanowires not only build a highway of the electron transport between CoNi@NC nanowires, but also provide a continuous 3D conductive network for the whole electrocatalyst. Meantime, such structure increases the electrical conductivity and the catalytic activity site of CoNi@NC-NCNTs. Combined with the above advantages, the nanoforest-like CoNi@NC-NCNTs electrode exhibits high HER and OER catalytic performance in 1 M KOH solution with low overpotentials of 85 mV and 263 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) and outstanding durability, respectively. The two-electrode electrolyzer assembled by CoNi@NC-NCNTs only requires 1.62 V to reach the current density of 10 mA cm(-2). This paper provides a well-defined model for constructing highly efficient catalyst toward overall water splitting.									15	0	0	0	0	0	15			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000531489800007

The development of high efficiency, poison tolerance, long-term stability, and noble metal-free electrocatalysts for methanol oxidation is still a major challenge. Herein, we develop a noble metal-free, 3D self-supported, defect-rich, hierarchical shell-core structured Ni3S2 composite on Ni foam as electrocatalyst. This electrocatalyst shows a good activity, poison tolerance, and long-term durability towards methanol oxidation in alkaline media. It shows the lowest onset potential (-340 mV vs. Hg/ HgO) among all the Ni-based catalysts reported up to date and a Pt-level specific activity. The methanol oxidation peak current of the electrocatalyst retains more than 97.5% even after 5,000 voltammetry cycles in 0.5 M KOH + 1 M CH3OH. The morphology and composition of the electrocatalysts before and after stability test were characterized by SEM, TEM, XRD, and XPS. The high activity, poison tolerance, and stability are attributed to the binder-free, directly grown Ni3S2 shell on the Ni foam backbone, the lattice defect sites, and the synergetic effects between the in-situ formed active NiOx core and Ni3S2 shell during methanol oxidation. This work indicates that the self-supported hierarchical shell-core Ni3S2@Ni foam electrocatalyst is a viable alternative for commercial Pt-based electrocatalyst applied in fuel cells.									11	2	0	0	0	0	12			2196-0216			WOS:000443381900009

The hydrothermal method was adopted for the synthesis of in situ Zr doping in FeOOH, while Zr-ZFO nanocorals was fashioned by subsequent additional procedures, such as Zn (NO3)(2) precursor dropping, first quenching, etching and second quenching. The Al2O3 layer decreases the overpotential of the Zr-ZFO photoanodellelectrolyte interface as well as lowers the charge transfer resistance which aids to increase in the photocurrent density from 0.24 mA/cm(2) to 0.36 mA/cm(2) at 1.23 V vs. RHE under 1 sun illumination condition. The subsequent loading of cobalt phosphate (Co-Pi) as a co-catalyst leads to an improved photocurrent density of 0.49 mA/cm(2) at 1.23 V vs. RHE. These synergistic effects of Zr doping and surface modification led to remarkable improvement in photocurrent density from 0.19 mA/cm(2) (at 1.4 V vs. RHE) for conventional ZFO nanorods to 0.65 mA/cm(2) for the Zr-ZFO/Al2O3/CoPi photoanode. A systematic investigation into the effect of Zr doping and Al2O3/Co-Pi overlayer reveals the reduction of two distinct recombination processes (bulk and surface) in ZFO photoanode.									25	0	0	0	1	0	25			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000523184600102

In this Communication, we report a space-confined phosphidation strategy toward developing hierarchical CoP nanosheet@microwire arrays on nickel foam (CoP NS@MW/NF) using a Co(H2PO4)(2)center dot 2H(3)PO(4) microwire array as the precursor. The thermally stable nature of the anion in the precursor is key to hierarchical nanostructure formation. When used as a 3D electrode for water oxidation electrocatalysis, such CoP NS@MW/NF needs an overpotential as low as 296 mV to drive a geometrical catalytic current density of 100 mA cm(-2) in 1.0 M KOH, outperforming all reported Co phosphide catalysts in alkaline media. This catalyst also shows superior long-term electrochemical durability, maintaining its activity for at least 65 h. This study offers us a general method for facile preparation of hierarchical arrays for applications.									177	6	0	0	0	0	178			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000432261400008	29676412	
J	Lentz, DR				/AAD-1690-2020				Petrogenetic evolution of felsic volcanic sequences associated with Phanerozoic volcanic-hosted massive sulphide systems: the role of extensional geodynamics								ORE GEOLOGY REVIEWS				12	5			289	327		10.1016/S0169-1368(98)00005-5				SEP 1998	1998	Felsic-volcanic hosted massive sulphide deposits form in many different geotectonic environments usually associated with episodes of extension. However, empirical geochemical links between felsic volcanism, geotectonic environment, and extensional geodynamics have not been adequately documented so as to distill the fundamental relationships between these features and formation of volcanic-hosted massive sulphide (VHMS) mineralization, which is important considering most VHMS deposits are hosted in felsic volcanic-bearing sequences. Using felsic geochemical data from six different VHMS mineralized Phanerozoic geotectonic settings, it seems that the felsic geochemical data are consistent with the overall geotectonic interpretations for these areas, which in turn helps in stratigraphic and geotectonic interpretations for detailed VHMS exploration. In extensional geodynamic settings, bimodal volcanism is common compared to the continuum of compositions observed under compressional to neutral (high-stress) regimes in calc-alkaline, arc-building environments. The empirical geochemical-metallogenic (VHMS) relationships evident in the Archean felsic volcanic rocks, in particular, the low Zr/Y (< 7) and low La-N/Yb-N (< 6), are also apparent in the Proterozoic and Phanerozoic felsic volcanic rocks. These low ratios are consistent with minimal fractional crystallization of hornblende (+/- clinopyroxene) through much of the lower and middle crust, (i.e., except the subvolcanic environment) and are related to low crustal residence times of magmas in extensional environments (i.e., rapid adiabatic ascent of magmas), low oxygen fugacities and low water fugacities of the magmas. These elemental ratios should closely reflect partial melting reactions that are a function of P, T, p(H2O) conditions in different source areas and geotectonic environments. They seem to be the predominant controls on the compositional evolution of felsic magmas in extensional settings, because of the limited degree of assimilation and fractional crystallization (AFC) affecting their compositions with rapid intrusion into the uppermost crust to positions were they achieve neutral buoyancy in the volcanic to subvolcanic environment. Within-plate felsic (or A-type/'Anorogenic' type) and anomalous ocean ridge (OR-type) felsic magmas that have tholeiitic affinities (relatively low alkali elements) are common within parts of the volcanic sequences hosting massive sulphide deposits reflecting, in part, a relationship to extension. The high contents of high-field-strength elements (Zr, Ga, LREE, HREE, Y, Nb, etc.) and other lines of evidence indicate they are relatively high-temperature, relatively reduced magmas probably derived from previously dehydrated granulitic or melted oceanic (simatic) or continental (sialic) crust (low P granulites or amphibolites), but also in some cases possibly mantle, rocks such that they are significantly water undersaturated during melting (i.e., a(H2O) much less than 1). Reduced viscosities typical of high temperature melts enable rapid intrusion to higher levels (diking vs. diapirism). Higher rates of heat advection from mantle mafic magmas into the thickened oceanic and/or continental crust during lithospheric extension are needed to facilitate melting of these rock to form A-type and/or OR-type partial melts (tholeiitic felsic). This usually results in bimodal magmatism as magma mixing is not favored in extensional settings, especially at high magma production, intrusion, and extrusion rates, i.e., high heat flow.This would inhibit ferromagnesian phase, in particular hornblende, and magnetite fractionation (especially at low fO(2)) in the felsic magmas that would deplete the melt in Y, HREE, as well as ore-related elements, particularly Zn, which is 2 to 3 times higher in A-type and OR-type rocks compared to other magma types. Therefore, the empirical felsic igneous geochemical-metallogenic relationships observed by others [low Zr/Y (< 7) and La-N/Yb-N (< 5) with VHMS mineralization] may simply represent the degree of fractional crystallization of ferromagnesian phases including magnetite and residence time in the deep to middle crust (i.e., rapid ascent rates) in extensional environments. The relationship between extensional geodynamic settings in intra-continental and intra-oceanic intra-arc, inter-are, and back-are rift environments and VHMS formation is simply related to extensional faulting, subsidence and submergence, high rates of heat advection to the near-surface environment and resultant seawater convection/reaction, and, in some cases, ocean basin redox conditions and possible contributions of magmatic-hydrothermal solutions.

Small fish with shallow bodies and large heads are typical in overcrowded monospecific fish communities in small ponds, whereas deep-bodied, large fish are found in larger, multispecies lakes. Crucian carp are especially vulnerable to predation by piscivorous fish and their greater relative body depth in multispecies fish communities has been proposed to be an induced defence against size-limited predation, and hence to be an adaptive feature. Data are presented here on the two divergent body forms in field populations in eastern Finland, together with results of laboratory experiments on predator effects on morphology and physiology (growth, respiration, heart rate). The deep body can be achieved in a few months by introducing a low population density of shallow-bodied fish into a food-rich environment with no piscivores. In the laboratory, both the presence of piscivores (chemical cues) and enhanced food availability increased the relative depth of crucian carp, but only to a modest extent when compared to natural variation. It is concluded that the deep-body form of crucian carp in the low density populations of multispecies fish communities is the normal condition. Reproduction in monospecific ponds results in high intraspecific competition, low growth rate and a stunted morphology. According to pilot tests, the mechanism behind the predator effect in the laboratory might be a behavioural reaction to chemical cues (alarm substances/predator odour) causing changes in energy allocation: predator-exposed crucian carp adopt a 'hiding' mode with decreased activity (less swimming, lower respiration and heart rate) and with higher overall growth. Whether, and to what extent, this predator-induced mechanism works in nature is unclear.

Wherein, three different cobalt phosphides with the same hollow structure morphology (CoP-HS, CoP2-HS, CoP3-HS) based on the same sacrificial template of ZIF-67 are prepared. Surprisingly, these cobalt phosphides exhibit similar OER performances but quite different HER performances. The identical OER performance of these CoPx-HS in alkaline solution is attributed to the similar surface reconstruction to CoOOH. CoP-HS exhibits the best catalytic activity for HER among these CoPx-HS in both acidic and alkaline media, originating from the adjusted electronic density of phosphorus to affect absorption-desorption process on H. Moreover, the calculated Delta G(H*) based on P-sites of CoP-HS follows a quite similar trend with the normalized overpotential and Tafel slope, indicating the important role of P-sites for the HER process. Moreover, CoP-HS displays good performance (cell voltage of 1.67 V at a current density of 50 mA cm(-2)) and high stability in 1 M KOH. For the first time, this work detailly presents the critical role of phosphorus in cobalt-based phosphides for water splitting, which provides the guidance for future investigations on transition metal phosphides from material design to mechanism understanding.									21	0	0	0	1	0	21			1613-6810	1613-6829		WOS:000716788700001	34761518

The preparation is achieved by ammonia activation at different volume fractions of ammonia in the mixture (10%, 25%, 50%, 75%, and 100%) to introduce the nitrogen-containing functional groups and form the original pores and subsequent chemical vapor deposition (CVD) at different deposition times (30, 60, 90, and 120 min) to further adjust the pore structure. The nitrogen content of ACs-0.1/0.25/0.5/0.75/1 increases gradually from 2.11% to 8.84% with the increase of ammonia ratio in the mixture from 10% to 75% and then decreases to 3.02% in the process of pure ammonia activation (100%), during which the relative content of pyridinium nitrogen (N-6), pyrrolidine (N-5), and graphite nitrogen (N-Q) increase sequentially but nitrogen oxygen structure (N-O) increase continuously. In addition, ACs-0.5 and ACs-0.75, with a relatively high nitrogen content (6.37% and 8.84%) and S-BET value (1048.65 m(2)/g and 814.36 m(2)/g), are selected as typical samples for subsequent CVD. In the stage of CVD, ACs-0.5-60 and ACs-0.75-90, with high S-BET (1897.25 and 1971.57 m(2)/g) value and an appropriate pore-size distribution between 0.5 and 0.8 nm, can be obtained with the extension of deposition time from 60 to 90 min. The results of CO2 adsorption test indicate that an adsorption capacity of ACs-0.75-90, at 800 mmHg, is the largest (6.87 mmol/g) out of all the tested samples. In addition, the comparison of CO2 adsorption performance of tested samples with different nitrogen content and pore structure indicates that the effect of nitrogen content seems to be more pronounced in this work.									1	0	0	0	1	0	1				2227-9717		WOS:000502263700027

The systematic study includes the effects of metal (W) and nonmetal (N) codoping on the electronic structure of NaTaO3 in comparison to the effect of individual dopants. The feasibility of the introduction of N into the NaTaO3 crystal structure is found to be enhanced in the presence of W, as indicated by the calculated formation energy. This codoping leads to formation of a charge compensated system, beneficial for the minimization of vacancy related defect formation. The electronic structure calculations have been carried out using a hybrid density functional for an accurate description of the proposed system. The introduction of W in place of Ta leads to the appearance of donor states below the conduction band, while N doping in place of oxygen introduces isolated acceptor states above the valence band. The codoping of N and W also passivates undesirable discrete midgap states. This feature is not observed in the case of (Cr, N) codoped NaTaO3 in spite of its charge compensated nature. We have also studied charge non-compensated codoping using several dopant pairs, including anion-anion and cation-anion pairs. However, this non-compensated codoping introduces localized states in between the valence band and the conduction band, and hence may not be effective in enhancing the photocatalytic properties of NaTaO3. The optical spectrum shows that the absorption curve for the (W, N)-codoped NaTaO3 is extended to the visible region due to narrowing of the band gap to 2.67 eV. Moreover, its activity for the photo decomposition of water to produce both H-2 and O-2 remains intact. Hence, based on the present investigation we can propose (W, N) codoped NaTaO3 as a promising photocatalyst for visible tight driven water splitting.									44	2	0	0	1	0	44			1463-9076	1463-9084		WOS:000340353000027	25007948	
J	Xiong, FS								Evidence that UV-B tolerance of the photosynthetic apparatus in microalgae is related to the D1-turnover mediated repair cycle in vivo								JOURNAL OF PLANT PHYSIOLOGY				158	3			285	294		10.1078/0176-1617-00306				MAR 2001	2001	The present study was conceived to elucidate the potential importance of the D1 turnover-mediated repair mechanism in UV-B tolerance of the photosynthetic apparatus in microalgae. To this end, the lab-identified UV-B sensitive and tolerant species of Chlorophyte and Chromophyte algae was used to examine photosynthetic response to UV-B exposure in the presence vs. the absence of streptomycin, an inhibitor of chloroplast protein synthesis. Measurements of photosynthetic O-2 evolution capacity and chlorophyll fluorescence parameters (F-v/F-m, Phi (PSII)) illustrated species-specific UV-B sensitivity of the photosynthetic apparatus. Addition of the inhibitor streptomycin caused significant enhancements of UV-B-caused depression of photosynthesis in UV-B tolerant species, while little effect was observed in the sensitive species. In the tolerant species, recovery from UV-B induced 20% decline in F-v/F-m reached completion within 2 hours, much faster than that in the sensitive species. Immunoblotting revealed that exposure to UV-B radiation caused substantial degradation of the D1 protein in the sensitive Heterococcus brevicellularis, which was little enhanced by addition of the inhibitor. The same UV-B exposure lead to less D1 degradation in the tolerant Scenedesmus sp.. which was significantly enhanced by addition of the inhibitor. This study shows that UV-B tolerance of the photosynthetic apparatus in microalgae was associated with a strong capacity for recovery from the UV-B-induced damage and this capacity related to the DI turnover-mediated repair cycle, and largely determined UV-B tolerance of the photosynthetic apparatus in these organisms.									39	6	0	0	38	0	46			0176-1617			WOS:000167777900002

To evaluate the participation of oxidative stress and defense mechanisms, temporal evolution of intraneuronal free radical generation was monitored by flow cytometry using dihydrorhodamine 123, in parallel with the study of transcriptional, translational, and activity changes of the detoxifying enzymes Cu/Zn-SOD and Mn-SOD. Two distinct peaks of radical generation were depicted, at the time of reoxygenation (+ 27%) and 48 h later (+ 25%), respectively. Radical production was unaffected by caspase inhibitors YVAD-CHO or DEVD-CHO, which prevented neuronal damage, suggesting that caspase activation is not an upstream initiator of radicals in this model. Cell treatment by vitamin E (100 muM) displayed significant neuroprotection, whereas the superoxide generating system xanthine/xanthine oxidase induced apoptosis. Transcript and protein levels of both SODs were reduced 1 h after the onset of hypoxia, but activities were transiently stimulated. Reoxygenation was associated with an increased expression (139%), but a decreased activity (21%) of the inducible Mn-SOD, whereas Cu/Zn-SOD protein and activity were low and progressively increased until 48 h post-hypoxia, when the second rise in radicals occurred. In spite of a temporal regulation of SODs, which parallels radical formation, oxidative stress might account for neurotoxicity induced by hypoxia.

However, before attempts can be made at maximizing pigment yield, all significant macroscopic compounds should be assayed. Here, Monascus purpureus has been grown on rice in batch mode, and the evolution of the main components, biomass, residual rice, O-2, CO2, ethanol, acetic acid, and pigments, have been followed. This set of data, never previously studied for Monascus SSF, allowed both the performance of a macroscopic elemental balance, which accounted for 83-94% of the initial substrate carbon, and a check of data consistency. Standard consistency analysis showed a significant underestimation of the nitrogen fraction of biomass, but it was unable to discriminate the errors in the carbon balance as a result of the simultaneous presence of two gross errors in the system. A simple stoichiometric model in tandem with consistency analysis explained unaccounted carbon as an underestimation of CO2 and ethanol. Using the simplified method to estimate ethanol, the macroscopic balance accounted for 87-99% of the initial carbon.									21	0	0	0	14	1	22			8756-7938	1520-6033		WOS:000086469600003	10753439

Barium stars are s-process enriched giants. They owe their chemical peculiarities to a past mass transfer phase. During this phase they were polluted by their binary companion, which at the time was an asymptotic giant branch (AGB) star, but is now an extinct white dwarf. Barium stars are thus ideal targets for understanding and constraining the s-process in low- and intermediate-mass AGB stars.Aims. We derive the abundances of a large number of heavy elements in order to shed light on the conditions of operation of the neutron source responsible for the production of s-elements in the former companions of the barium stars.Methods. Adopting a recently used methodology, we analyse a sample of eighteen highly enriched barium stars observed with the high-resolution HERMES spectrograph mounted on the Mercator telescope (La Palma). We determine the stellar parameters and abundances using MARCS model atmospheres. In particular, we derive the Nb-Zr ratio which was previously shown to be a sensitive thermometer for the s-process nucleosynthesis. Indeed, in barium stars, Zr-93 has fully decayed into mono-isotopic Nb-93, so Nb/Zr is a measure of the temperature-sensitive Zr-93/Zr isotopic ratio.Results. HD 28159, previously classified as K5III and initially selected to serve as a reference cool K star for our abundance analysis, turns out to be enriched in s-process elements, and as such is a new barium star. Four stars are characterised by high nitrogen abundances, and among those three have high [Nb/Zr] and [hs/ls] ratios. The derived Zr and Nb abundances provide more accurate constraints on the s-process neutron source, identified to be C-13(alpha, n)O-16 for barium stars. The comparison with stellar evolution and nucleosynthesis models shows that the investigated barium stars were polluted by a low-mass (M similar to 2-3 M-circle dot) AGB star. HD 100503 is potentially identified as a high metallicity analogue of carbon-enhanced metal-poor star enriched in both r- and s-process elements (CEMP-rs).									23	0	0	0	0	0	23			1432-0746			WOS:000446839800001

However, the ZnSe:CIGS particles used in prior studies had wide particle size distributions, on the order of submicrons to microns. Thus, it may be possible to improve the PEC activity by controlling particle size, rather than the conventional surface modification and/or optimization of synthesis conditions. In the present study, ZnSe:CIGS particles synthesized via a flux method were classified into three categories with average particle sizes of 14.2 mu m (large), 4.46 mu m (middle) and 1.09 mu m (small), and the origin of the particle size effect on PEC performance was examined using electrochemical techniques. A particulate photocathode made using the middle ZnSe:CIGS particles exhibited higher cathodic photocurrent than one made of the original unclassified material, while the small and large particles showed inferior performances. Stripping voltammetry demonstrated that the larger particle size increased the specific surface area of the semiconductor particles on the photoelectrode surface and also increased the electrochemically active surface area of the Pt. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy indicated that the carrier density and flat-band potential values of the small and middle particles were similar, whereas the large particles showed a low carrier density and a negative flat-band potential shift. Increasing the particle size increased the resistance of the bulk particulate semiconductor, possibly suppressing migration of the majority carriers to the back contact layer. The data indicate that the particle size dependence of the PEC properties of particulate ZnSe:CIGS photocathodes can be attributed to the effects of specific surface area, carrier density and bulk resistance.									8	2	0	0	1	0	8			2398-4902			WOS:000611818900009

Mn is involved as cofactor in many reactions of plant metabolism. One of its important functions is linked to the chlorophyll efficiency and in redox processes. Compartmentation of Mn++ in cells could compete with Mg nutrition: Mg uptake, therefore, can be strongly depressed by Mill cations and vice versa. A decrease in Mill content of leaves has a small effect on chlorophyll content but a great effect on photosynthetic oxygen evolution drop. Mn deficiency (on apple 15 mg Kg(-1) dry weight in fully expanded leaves) is often linked to interveinal or blotched chlorosis both in young and in old mature leaves. Mn availability is reduced in basic soils, with a large organic matter content. These conditions are often registered in Non Valley (Trentino -Northeastern Italy) where early leaf drop is widespread. Normally leaf drop is linked to Mn deficiency. It tends to be more common when a cool, rainy period of 4 to 5 days is followed by hot, summer weather. The disorder is characterized by the development of necrotic blotches or irregular areas of dead tissue (brown blotches) in mature leaves. The present work aims at verifying the effect of foliar application of Mn in order to correct Mn deficiency and to prevent leaf drop. After a preliminary experiment carried out in 1996, the trial was performed on Golden Delicious at Cles (Non Valley), using a factorial experimental layout from 1997 to 1999. Sixty trees were tested for three different foliar applications of Mn (test, autumn and spring applications). The effect of rootstock on Mill nutrition was also tested in five different rootstocks (M9, M26, MM106, M11, Mark) each replicated four times. During the trial period leaf drop incidence, percentage of blotched leaves, greenness and nutritional status of the leaves were yearly measured throughout the growing season in different periods. Spring treated trees had higher leaf Mill concentration than autumn treated trees and control ones. Leaf drop incidence, leaf greenness and percentage of blotched leaves were statistically affected by foliar application. The spring combination was more effective in reducing leaf drop than autumn treatment. Rootstock effect was registered too on Mn and Mg nutrition. MM106 and M11 had the lowest leaf Mg concentrations, whilst Mark the highest values. M26 showed the highest values of leaf Mn concentrations, whilst M11 the lowest, in test trees and in autumn Mn foliar sprayed trees. The greatest disorders were associated with low values of both Mill and Mg. The role of Mn seems to be more important in determining of leaf drop. The rootstock choice (M9, M26 and Mark are preferred) could be therefore successfully used in prevent leaf drop.

In this study, a caspase-3 (Mncaspase3c) was cloned from gill of the oriental river prawn Macrobrachium nipponense by reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction and rapid amplification of cDNA ends, and its properties were characterized. The 1730-bp cDNA contained an open reading frame of 1566 bp, a 123-bp 5'-untranslated region (UTR), and a 41-bp 3'-UTR containing a poly(A) tail. The molecular mass of the deduced amino acid (aa) sequence (521 aa) was 56.3 kDa with an estimated pI of 5.01. The MnCaspase-3c sequence contained a predicted caspase family p20 domain and a caspase family p10 domain at positions 236-367 and 378 468 respectively. Recombinant MnCaspase-3c protein was expressed in Escherichia coli and purified. In vitro activity assays indicated that the recombinant MnCaspase-3c hydrolyzed the substrate Ac-DEVDpNA, suggesting a physiological role as a caspase-3. Caspase-3c gene transcripts were distributed in all M. nipponense tissues tested by quantitative RT-PCR, being especially abundant in hemocytes. Comet assays in gill tissues showed an obvious time-dependent response to hypoxia. Furthermore, Mncaspase3c, at both the mRNA and protein levels, was demonstrated to participate in the apoptotic process in gill after stimulation by acute hypoxia. Overall, these results indicate that hypoxia triggers apoptosis in shrimp gill tissues.

II sample types using time-resolved mass spectrometry. The samples included thylakoid membranes, salt-washed Triton X-100-prepared membrane fragments, and purified core complexes from spinach and cyanobacteria. For each sample type, two kinetically distinct isotopic exchange rates could be resolved, indicating that the biphasic exchange behavior for the substrate water is inherent to the O-2-evolving catalytic site in the S3 state. However, the fast phase of exchange became somewhat slower (by a factor of similar to2) in NaCl-washed membrane fragments and core complexes from spinach in which the 16- and 23-kDa extrinsic proteins have been removed, compared with the corresponding rate for the intact samples. For CaCl2-washed membrane fragments in which the 33-kDa manganese stabilizing protein (MSP) has also been removed, the fast phase of exchange slowed down even further (by a factor of similar to3). Interestingly, the slow phase of exchange was little affected in the samples from spinach. For core complexes prepared from Synechocystis PCC 6803 and Synechococcus elongatus, the fast and slow exchange rates were variously affected. Nevertheless, within the experimental error, nearly the same exchange rates were measured for thylakoid samples made from wild type and an MSP-lacking mutant of Synechocystis PCC 6803. This result could indicate that the MSP has a slightly different function in eukaryotic organisms compared with prokaryotic organisms. In all samples, however, the differences in the exchange rates are relatively small. Such small differences are unlikely to arise from major changes in the metal-ligand structure at the catalytic site. Rather, the observed differences may reflect subtle long range effects in which the exchange reaction coordinates become slightly altered. We discuss the results in terms of solvent penetration into photosystem II and the regional dielectric around the catalytic site.									37	1	1	0	27	0	38			0021-9258	1083-351X		WOS:000172768500034	11595731

Although the precise depositional age is unknown, maximum age constraints for the Puga IFs are defined by the youngest detrital zircon with an U-Pb age of 706 +/- 9 Ma (Babinski et al., 2013), a result which we here confirm by a U-Pb age of the youngest zircon of 695 +/- 17 Ma from within shaly beds in the Urucum district IF succession. Redox-sensitive trace element signatures and tendency to hump-shaped Rare Earth Element + Yttrium (REY) patterns with negative Ce- but without Eu anomalies support the presence of an oxic surface water layer, fertilized by low temperature hydrothermal fluids injected from submarine thermal springs and/or, alternatively, by significant fresh water input directly derived from glacial meltdown. Strongly positively fractionated, authigenic chromium isotope signatures (average delta Cr-53 = 1.10 +/- 0.4 parts per thousand.; n = 16; 2 sigma) prevailing throughout the entire stratigraphic section indicate that riverine supply of continentally-derived Cr, remained more or less constant throughout the glacier meltdown and IF depositional period. Cycling across a redoxcline and predominant deposition of the IF in anoxic deeper seawater of the Jacadigo basin is supported by the peculiar presence of subchondritic Y/Ho ratios, by decreased negative Ce anomalies and by shifts of LREE patterns towards higher values in the Urucum district IFs that are independent of detrital contamination.The strongly positively fractionated Cr isotope signatures measured in these iron formations are compatible with those from other iron formations and black shales deposited during the late Neoproterozoic and Precambrian-Cambrian transition worldwide and are in support of prevailing high atmospheric O-2 levels following the late Neoproterozoic glaciations that accompanied the evolution of macroscopic multicellular organisms.

Here, we tested the hypothesis that chemodenitrification, the rapid reduction of nitric oxide by ferrous iron, would have enhanced the flux of N2O from ferruginous Proterozoic seas. We empirically derived a rate law, d[N2O]/dr = 7.2x10-5[Fe2+]0.3[NO]1 , and measured an isotopic site preference of +16 parts per thousand for the reaction. Using this empirical rate law, and integrating across an oceanwide oxycline, we found that low nM NO and M-low mM Fe2+ concentrations could have sustained a sea-air flux of 100-200 Tg N2O-Nyear(-1), if N-2 fixation rates were near-modern and all fixed N-2 was emitted as N2O. A 1D photochemical model was used to obtain steady-state atmospheric N2O concentrations as a function of sea-air N2O flux across the wide range of possible pO(2) values (0.001-1 PAL). At 100-200 Tg N2O-Nyear(-1) and >0.1 PAL O-2, this model yielded low-ppmv N2O, which would produce several degrees of greenhouse warming at 1.6ppmv CH4 and 320ppmv CO2. These results suggest that enhanced N2O production in ferruginous seawater via a previously unconsidered chemodenitrification pathway may have helped to fill a Proterozoic greenhouse gap, reconciling an ice-free Mesoproterozoic Earth with a less luminous early Sun. A particularly notable result was that high N2O fluxes at intermediate O-2 concentrations (0.01-0.1 PAL) would have enhanced ozone screening of solar UV radiation. Due to rapid photolysis in the absence of an ozone shield, N2O is unlikely to have been an important greenhouse gas if Mesoproterozoic O-2 was 0.001 PAL. At low O-2, N2O might have played a more important role as life's primary terminal electron acceptor during the transition from an anoxic to oxic surface Earth, and correspondingly, from anaerobic to aerobic metabolisms.									26	0	0	0	14	0	26			1472-4677	1472-4669		WOS:000446987700002	30133143

The CXCR CXCR3 gene has two isoforms, CXCR3.1 and CXCR3.2, which are both expressed in macrophages. The distinct roles of teleost CXCR3s have not been identified previously. In this article, we found that CXCR3.1 and CXCR3.2 differentially contributed to macrophage polarization in the teleosts: ayu (Plecoglossus altivelis), grass carp (Ctenopharyngodon idella), and spotted green pufferfish (Tetraodon nigroviridis). In ayu macrophages, the P. altivelis CXCR3.1 (PaCXCR3.1) gene was constitutively expressed, whereas the P. altivelis CXCR3.2 (PaCXCR3.2) gene was induced postinfection with Escherichia coli. Upon E. coli infection, PaCXCR3.1 (+) and PaCXCR3.2 (+) macrophages showed an M1 and an M2 phenotype, respectively. CXCL911- like proteins mediated M1 and M2 polarization by interacting with the PaCXCR3.1 and PaCXCR3.2 proteins on macrophages, respectively. The transcription factors P. altivelis STAT1 and P. altivelis STAT3 were activated in PaCXCR3.1 (+) and PaCXCR3.2 (+) macrophages, respectively. Furthermore, the prognosis of septic ayu adoptively transferred with PaCXCR3.2 (+) macrophages was improved. Our data reveal a previously unknown mechanism for macrophage polarization, suggesting that redundant genes may regulate crucial functions in the teleost immune system.									34	2	0	0	28	0	35			0022-1767	1550-6606		WOS:000405271300016	28500070

The highly conserved linear order of the genes flanking the hemoglobins provides a strong anchor for inferring common ancestry of the globin clusters. In fish, the number of alpha-beta-linked globin genes varies considerably between different sublineages and seems to be related to prevailing physico-chemical conditions. Draft sequences of the Atlantic cod genome enabled us to determine the genomic organization of the globin repertoire in this marine species that copes with fluctuating environments of the temperate and Arctic regions.Results: The Atlantic cod genome was shown to contain 14 globin genes, including nine hemoglobin genes organized in two unlinked clusters designated beta 5-alpha 1-beta 1-alpha 4 and beta 3-beta 4-alpha 2-alpha 3-beta 2. The diverged cod hemoglobin genes displayed different expression levels in adult fish, and tetrameric hemoglobins with or without a Root effect were predicted. The novel finding of maternally inherited hemoglobin mRNAs is consistent with a potential role played by fish hemoglobins in the non-specific immune response. In silico analysis of the six teleost genomes available showed that the two alpha-beta globin clusters are flanked by paralogs of five duplicated genes, in agreement with the proposed teleost-specific duplication of the ancestral vertebrate globin cluster. Screening the genome of extant urochordate and cephalochordate species for conserved globin-flanking genes revealed linkage of RHBDF1, MPG and ARHGAP17 to globin genes in the tunicate Ciona intestinalis, while these genes together with LCMT are closely positioned in amphioxus (Branchiostoma floridae), but seem to be unlinked to the multiple globin genes identified in this species.Conclusion: The plasticity of Atlantic cod to variable environmental conditions probably involves the expression of multiple globins with potentially different properties. The interspecific difference in number of fish hemoglobin genes contrasts with the highly conserved synteny of the flanking genes. The proximity of globin-flanking genes in the tunicate and amphioxus genomes resembles the RHBDF1-MPG-alpha-globin-ARHGAP17-LCMT linked genes in man and chicken. We hypothesize that the fusion of the three chordate linkage groups 3, 15 and 17 more than 800 MYA led to the ancestral vertebrate globin cluster during a geological period of increased atmospheric oxygen content.									20	1	0	0	20	0	21			1471-2148			WOS:000285338500001	20961401	
J	Mattheis, James P.; Felicetti, David A.; Rudell, David R.								'd'Anjou' pear metabolism during ultra-low O-2, low CO2 controlled atmosphere storage reflects disorder outcome								POSTHARVEST BIOLOGY AND TECHNOLOGY				185						111781	10.1016/j.postharvbio.2021.111781		NOV 2021		MAR 2022	2022	With increasingly restrictive regulation of postharvest crop protectants and expected year-round availability, pear (Pyrus communis L.) production is ever more reliant on precise controlled atmosphere (CA) storage technologies to provide both ripening and disorder control for long term storage. Ultra-low oxygen (ULO; <1 kPa O-2) CA storage meets many of these criteria affording control of ripening and superficial scald. However, internal browning often is an unintended outcome caused by atmospheric conditions and other events that occur, similarly to superficial scald, prior to symptom development. While this is often associated with elevated CO2, it also can occur at lower partial pressures (<0.5 kPa CO2) reducing its widespread use for storing pears. We expected levels of specific metabolites in 'd'Anjou', a cultivar susceptible to both disorders, would reflect specific disorder risk under ULO and low CO2. The metabolic profile of pear peel stored at 0.5 degrees C in air, CA (1.5 kPa O-2; 0.5 kPa CO2), or ULO (determined in the first week of storage by monitoring chlorophyll fluorescence; 0.5 kPa O-2; 0.5 kPa CO2) was compared at multiple time points during 0-16 weeks storage. Final fruit quality and relative ripeness were assessed at 16 weeks plus 7 d at 20 degrees C. Quality and ripeness differences and related metabolism followed that established in existing literature regarding peel color, titratable acidity, ethylene evolution, respiration, and sucrose metabolism. Superficial scald developed on air stored fruit and core browning incidence most in pears stored in 0.4 kPa O-2. alpha-Farnesene oxidation increased most in air followed by 1.5 kPa O-2 storage indicating risk of this disorder on fruit from those storage conditions. As in other studies, gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) was elevated most where internal browning had occurred, although levels were also elevated in the peel. Levels of glutamic acid, alanine, and, unique to this study, proline were also most elevated in peel from pears stored in 0.5 kPa O-2 indicating their association with conditions that lead to core browning. Monitoring alpha-farnesene oxidation coupled with GABA, glutamic acid, alanine, and proline levels in peel may be a means to indicate whether ULO CA atmospheres with reduced CO2 levels are accomplishing the critical task of controlling pear superficial scald without causing internal browning before injury occurs.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0925-5214	1873-2356		WOS:000721608900001

To reach this aim, the behavior of fuel cell catalysts must be investigated directly under reaction conditions. Herein, we applied a strategic combination of in situ/online techniques: in situ electrochemical atomic force microscopy, in situ grazing incidence small angle X-ray scattering, and electrochemical scanning flow cell with online detection by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. This combination of techniques allows in-depth investigation of the potential-dependent surface restructuring of a PtNi model thin film catalyst during potentiodynamic cycling in an aqueous acidic electrolyte. The study reveals a clear correlation between the upper potential limit and structural behavior of the PtNi catalyst, namely, its dealloying and coarsening. The results show that at 0.6 and 1.0 V-RHE upper potentials, the PtNi catalyst essentially preserves its structure during the entire cycling procedure. The crucial changes in the morphology of PtNi layers are found to occur at 1.3 and 1.5 V-RHE cycling potentials. Strong dealloying at the early stage of cycling is substituted with strong coarsening of catalyst particles at the later stage. The coarsening at the later stage of cycling is assigned to the electrochemical Ostwald ripening process.									14	0	0	0	0	0	14			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000526330900045	32191029

The level of these adaptive responses in thermal physiology can vary among populations of broadly distributed species depending on their particular environmental context and genetic backgrounds. Here we examined thermal performances and reaction norms for metabolic rate (MR) and heart rate (HR) of seven populations of the porcelanid crab Petrolisthes violaceus from markedly different thermal environments across the latitudinal gradient of similar to 3000 km. Physiological responses of this intertidal crab under common-garden conditions suggest the absence of local thermal adaptation along the geographic gradient (i.e., lack of latitudinal compensation). Moreover, thermal physiological sensitivities and performances in response to increased temperatures evidenced the existence of some level of: i) metabolic rate control or depression during warm temperature exposures; and ii) homeostasis/canalization (i.e., absence or low levels of plasticity) in physiological traits that may reflect some sort of buffering mechanism in most of the populations. Nevertheless, our results indicate that elevated temperatures can reduce cardiac function but not metabolic rate in high latitude crabs. The lack of congruence between HR and MR supports the idea that energy metabolism in marine invertebrates cannot be inferred from HR and different conclusions regarding geographic differentiation in energy metabolism can be obtained from both physiological traits. Integrating thermal physiology and species range extent can contribute to a better understanding of the likely effects of climate change on natural populations of marine ectotherms.									20	0	0	0	20	0	20			0306-4565	1879-0992		WOS:000405976100003	28689716

Nanodimensional heterostructures, essentially, expose a large fraction of active edge sites, which, along with excellent electronic communication, can result in high solar energy to chemical fuel conversion efficiencies. In this work, mesoporous heterojunction architectures made of ultrasmall MoS2 nanolayers (ca. 10-15 nm in lateral size) and sub 5 nm sized CdS nanocrystals have been prepared through a polymer-templated oxidative aggregation of CdS nanocrystals followed by a wet-chemical deposition of exfoliated MoS2 nanosheets on the CdS surface. Thorough chemical, morphological and structural investigations by electron microprobe analysis, X-ray diffraction, electron microscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and N-2 physisorption prove that the MoS2-modified CdS nanocatalysts are composed of a porous network of connected cubic CdS nanocrystals and 2H-phase MoS2 nanosheets and possess a high internal BET surface area (ca. 159-225 m(2) g(-1)) and uniform pores (ca. 6-9 nm in diameter). Photocatalytic studies coupled with UV-vis/NIR, photoluminescence and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy measurements indicate that the nanoscale MoS2/CdS junctions provide more efficient electronic connectivity and charge carrier dissociation across the catalyst interfaces, resulting in a remarkable enhancement in the photocatalytic H-2 production activity. The optimized MoS2/CdS catalyst at 20 wt% MoS2 content achieves a H-2 production rate up to similar to 0.4 mmol h(-1) (or similar to 19 mmol h(-1) g(-1) mass activity) with remarkable stability under visible light irradiation, corresponding to an overall 6.7x enhancement of H-2 generation efficiency relative to the unmodified CdS. We also obtained an apparent quantum yield (AQY) of 51.2% for the hydrogen generation reaction using monochromatic light of 420 nm.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			2052-1553			WOS:000742407800001

Herein, Cd1-xZnxS nanocrystals based on ZB/WZ heterophase junction with different molar ratios of Cd/Zn were synthesized by one-step solvothermal process. XRD analysis and HRTEM images verified the formation of nano-twin structures in the Cd0.6Zn0.4S solid solution. Photoluminescence (PL) spectra, time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) spectra, Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) test and Photocurrent response revealed that the recombination of photogenerated charge carriers has been reduced due to the presence of ZB/WZ heterophase junction. The experimental results showed that the photocatalytic activity of Cd0.6Zn0.4S without noble metal load was the best under visible light irradiation, and the hydrogen production efficiency was up to 472 mmol h(-1) and an apparent quantum efficiency of 9.8% at 420 nm. The periodic type-II staggered energy band arrangement formed between ZB and WZ phases can orientate the photoinduced electrons and holes to ZB and WZ regions, respectively, and redox reactions can occur on the surface. Meanwhile, Cd0.6Zn0.4S exhibited good stability for hydrogen production. The result provides an available progress for the development of photocatalytic mechanism in heterophase junction between ZB and WZ phases, leading to the vectorial interfacial transfer of photogenerated e(-)/h(+) pairs and prolonged carrier lifetime which can effectively enhance the photocatalytic reactivity.

The cathode is based on carbon-fiber cloth (CC) and loaded CoFe2O4 with carbon nano-fibers (CNFs), matching well with Ag NPs/ZnO NRs/NiF photo-anode to drive PFC work. The CNFs/CoFe2O4/CC cathode is multifunctional, it can activate PMS for sulfate radical (SO4-) generation, and can simultaneously accept electrons from photo-anode for transform between Co3+ and Co2+. The adding of PMS in PFC system boosts radical formation and cyclic reactions between related species. This PFC-PMS system showed a high antibiotic degradation efficiency and stable electricity generation (93.5% for berberine degradation, 9.18 h(-1) for kinetic rate constant, similar to 0.50 V for cell-voltage at 2000 Omega). In addition, the pollutant removal capacity, influencing factors and the pollutant degradation mechanism in PFC-PMS system were illustrated. The feasible mechanism of berberine degradation was elucidated by the radical trapping and EPR test and these results confirmed that the formation of reactive species, including SO4-, % OH, O-2(-), O-1(2) radicals and holes. This study suggests that the established PFC-PMS system is more efficient in wastewater treatment and simultaneous energy recovery.									27	1	0	0	9	0	27			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000487764800078

On exposure to nutrient solution without Mo, leaf morphology was significantly affected, whereas photosynthetic processes conserved their normal activities. The decreased Mo, Fe, and Ca concentrations in tobacco were associated with loss of pigments and photosynthetic disturbances. In Ca-deficient plants a reduction in the rate constant of energy trapping by PSII centers and a physical dissociation of LHC from PSII core, were observed. The poisonous action of Fe and Ca deficiencies focused mainly in the decreased proportion of active chlorophyll associated with the reaction center (RC) of PSII (decreased F-v/F-0) and in the declined total number of electrons that have gone through the RCs (decreased Area/F-m - F-0). In parallel, the non-photochemical quenching coefficient was significantly enhanced in Fe and Ca-deficient plants, but remained unchanged in Mo-deficient plants. It is obvious that nutrient deficiency may trigger some protective mechanisms in order to PSII could maintain its activity under that type of stress.									11	0	0	0	9	0	12			0190-4167			WOS:000183984100006

In this study, we experimentally equilibrated apatite with mafic silicate melt at 1000 degrees C, 300 MPa and a range of oxygen fugacity (fO(2); log fO(2) [DFMQ] = -1, 0, +0.3, +1.2, and +3 where FMQ is the fayalite-magnetite-quartz mineral redox buffer) to explore the partitioning behavior of S, including different oxidation states of S, between apatite and silicate melt. The data reveal that D-S(ap/m) values increase systematically with increasing fO(2), from 0.02 +/- 0.01 at log fO(2) [DFMQ] of -1 to 3.20 +/- 0.19 at log fO(2) [DFMQ] of +3. The bulk S content (similar to 0.37 and similar to 0.28 wt.% S added) imparts a minor influence on D-S(ap/m) at reducing conditions.Micro X-ray absorption near edge structure (mu-XANES) spectroscopy at the S K-edge was used to measure, in situ, the oxidation states of S in experimentally crystallized apatite. The SXANES analyses reveal that with increasing fO(2), apatite progressively incorporates S6+ >> S2- > S4+ > S1+. The integrated S6+/Sigma S peak area ratios and centroid energies (eV) were determined for apatite crystals in apatite from experiments at all fO(2) conditions. The orientation effects occurring during S-XANES analyses of apatite were considered by merging spectra from multiple grains with random crystallographic orientation. The S-XANES data reveal that S6+/Sigma S peak area ratios and the centroid energies increase systematically with fO(2), demonstrating that the S6+/Sigma S ratio in apatite can be used as an oxybarometer.The results demonstrate that both the S6+/Sigma S and C-eV calibration methods are highly sensitive in the redox range of similar to FMQ to similar to FMQ + 1.2 at the conditions and compositions evaluated in this study. As a result, the S-in-apatite oxybarometer is particularly applicable to mafic systems such as mid ocean ridge basalts (MORB), relatively reduced ocean island basalts (OIB), and back-arc basin basalt (BABB). Owing to the ubiquity of apatite in magmatic and magmatic-hydrothermal systems, measuring the concentration and oxidations state(s) of S-in-apatite has the potential to serve as a powerful sulfo- and oxybarometer for a broad range of natural systems.

However, they too expensive to be implemented broadly in semiconductor photoanodes for photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting devices. Here, an Earth-abundant CoFe Prussian blue analogue (CoFe-PBA) is incorporated with core-shell Fe2O3/Fe2TiO5 type II heterojunction nanowires as composite photoanodes for PEC water splitting. Those deliver a high photocurrent of 1.25 mA cm(-2) at 1.23 V versus reversible reference electrode in acidic electrolytes (pH = 1). The enhancement arises from the synergic behavior between the successive decoration of the hematite surface with nanolayers of Fe2TiO5 and then, CoFe-PBA. The underlying physical mechanism of performance enhancement through formation of the Fe2O3/Fe2TiO5/CoFe-PBA heterostructure reveals that the surface states' electronic levels of hematite are modified such that an interfacial charge transfer becomes kinetically favorable. These findings open new pathways for the future design of cheap and efficient hematite-based photoanodes in acidic electrolytes.									39	1	0	0	6	0	39			1614-6832	1614-6840		WOS:000484080400001

In-depth electrochemical characterisation of stationary electrodes as well as rotating disc electrode (RDE) measurements in hanging meniscus configuration becomes possible. Additionally, the temperature of the electrodes in contact with electrolytes can be accurately controlled between room temperature and 70-80 degrees C. It is of particular importance for model electro-catalytic studies that in one experimental set-up (i) electrochemical metal and non-metal deposition to adjust the amount of the foreign atoms at the surface, (ii) controllable thermal treatment to vary the position of these atoms at the surface and subsurface regions, and (iii) state-of-the-art techniques common in electrocatalysis to characterise the resulting samples are possible. The deposition and annealing procedures under various atmospheres allow accurate control over the position of the foreign atoms at the electrode surface as overlayers, surface alloys and sub-surface (or near-surface) alloys, where the solute element is preferentially located in the second atomic layer of the host metal. The cell enables us to perform all operations without exposing the samples to the laboratory atmosphere at any of the experimental stages. To demonstrate the performance and advantages of the developed cell, we use model experiments with Pt(111) single crystal electrodes and Pt(111) surfaces modified with (sub) monolayer amounts of copper.									16	0	0	0	1	0	16			1463-9076	1463-9084		WOS:000321954200024	23817497

The growth of TM202 was retarded under high light (130 mu mol/m(2)/s), whereas KM2-9 grew at a normal rate but exhibited a nitrogen-deficient phenotype, Measurement of photosynthetic O-2 evolution revealed that the reducing power was not efficiently partitioned into nitrogen assimilation in KM2-9, After starvation of the cells in darkness, the P700 oxidation level under far-red illumination increased significantly in TM202, However, it remained low in KM2-9, indicating an active cyclic electron flow. In accordance with this, the cellular ratio of ATP/ADP increased and that of NADPH/NADP(+) decreased in KM2-9 as compared with TM202. These results demonstrated that the two cell type-specific ferredoxins differentially modulate electron flow around photosystem I.									45	0	0	0	44	0	46			0261-4189			WOS:000089792100001	11013207	
J	Steiner, Ulrich Karl				Steiner, Ulrich/AAQ-2713-2021	Steiner, Ulrich/0000-0002-1778-5989			Senescence in Bacteria and Its Underlying Mechanisms								FRONTIERS IN CELL AND DEVELOPMENTAL BIOLOGY				9						668915	10.3389/fcell.2021.668915				JUN 18 2021	2021	Bacteria have been thought to flee senescence by dividing into two identical daughter cells, but this notion of immortality has changed over the last two decades. Asymmetry between the resulting daughter cells after binary fission is revealed in physiological function, cell growth, and survival probabilities and is expected from theoretical understanding. Since the discovery of senescence in morphologically identical but physiologically asymmetric dividing bacteria, the mechanisms of bacteria aging have been explored across levels of biological organization. Quantitative investigations are heavily biased toward Escherichia coli and on the role of inclusion bodies-clusters of misfolded proteins. Despite intensive efforts to date, it is not evident if and how inclusion bodies, a phenotype linked to the loss of proteostasis and one of the consequences of a chain of reactions triggered by reactive oxygen species, contribute to senescence in bacteria. Recent findings in bacteria question that inclusion bodies are only deleterious, illustrated by fitness advantages of cells holding inclusion bodies under varying environmental conditions. The contributions of other hallmarks of aging, identified for metazoans, remain elusive. For instance, genomic instability appears to be age independent, epigenetic alterations might be little age specific, and other hallmarks do not play a major role in bacteria systems. What is surprising is that, on the one hand, classical senescence patterns, such as an early exponential increase in mortality followed by late age mortality plateaus, are found, but, on the other hand, identifying mechanisms that link to these patterns is challenging. Senescence patterns are sensitive to environmental conditions and to genetic background, even within species, which suggests diverse evolutionary selective forces on senescence that go beyond generalized expectations of classical evolutionary theories of aging. Given the molecular tool kits available in bacteria, the high control of experimental conditions, the high-throughput data collection using microfluidic systems, and the ease of life cell imaging of fluorescently marked transcription, translation, and proteomic dynamics, in combination with the simple demographics of growth, division, and mortality of bacteria, make the challenges surprising. The diversity of mechanisms and patterns revealed and their environmental dependencies not only present challenges but also open exciting opportunities for the discovery and deeper understanding of aging and its mechanisms, maybe beyond bacteria and aging.									2	0	0	0	2	0	2			2296-634X			WOS:000668931500001	34222238

A partial transformation of the CoFe2O4 educt to CoO is observed and proposed to be a thermal decomposition process induced by the picosecond pulsed laser irradiation. The overpotential in the OER in aqueous alkaline media at 10 mA cm(-2) is reduced by 23% compared to the educt down to 0.32 V with a Tafel slope of 71 mV dec(-1). Importantly, the catalytic activity is systematically adjustable by the number of PLFL treatment cycles. The occurrence of thermal melting and decomposition during one PLFL cycle is verified by modelling the laser beam energy distribution within the irradiated colloid volume and comparing the by single particles absorbed part to threshold energies. Thermal decomposition leads to a massive reduction in particle size and crystal transformations towards crystalline CoO and amorphous CoFe2O4. Subsequently, thermal melting forms multi-phase spherical and network-like particles. Additionally, Fe-based layered double hydroxides at higher process cycle repetitions emerge as a byproduct. The results show that PLFL is a promising method that allows modification of the structural order in oxides and thus access to catalytically interesting materials.									42	1	0	0	2	1	42			2045-2322			WOS:000412956900051	29030573

Herein, we report enhanced photocatalytic H-2-production performance over CdS nanorod using cobalt-phosphate (Co-Pi) as a water oxdation cocatalyst. The optimal Co-Pi modified CdS nanocomposite photocatalyst with the Co-Pi content of 8.4 mol% has a superior visible light H-2-production rate of 13.3 mmol h(-1) g(-1) with an apparent quantum efficiency of 24.3% at 420 nm, which is even higher than that of 1 wt% Pt-CdS (11.3 mmol h(-1) g(-1)) under the same conditions. The enhanced visible-light photocatalytic H-2 production activity was attributed to the hole trapping and collecting ability of Co-Pi cocatalyst, which could effectively suppress the recombination of photo-generated electron-hole pairs and increase the electron density for hydrogen production. This work shows a possibility of using earth-abundant Co-Pi as cocatalyst for enhancing photocatalytic H-2 production. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Although all the carboxylate species lower considerably the oxidation potential of Mn-II, only bicarbonate stimulates the electron transfer from Mn-II to apo-WOC-PSII. On the basis of the electrochemical data it is proposed that the unique capability of Mn-bicarbonate complexes to be photooxidized by PSII could be due to four possible reasons: (i) significantly larger decrease in the oxidation potential of Mn-II (down to 0.52 V); (ii) electroneutrality of the functional electron transfer complex; (iii) the more favorable energetics reflected in the two pK(a) values for H2CO3/HCO3- and HCO3-/CO32- and greater number of proton transfer sites; and (iv) multiple composition possibilities for the Mn-III photo-product as Mn-III(HCO3-)(3), Mn-III(HCO3-)(CO32-) and Mn-III (HCO3-)(2)(OH-) (due to the high Lewis acidity of Mn-III (pK < 1).									50	1	3	0	36	0	54			1463-9076	1463-9084		WOS:000224755500025

The activity and stability of these composite electrodes towards water oxidation in acidic media (pH < 1) was examined by electrochemical methods and post-catalytic characterization. Our results indicate the stability of these catalysts in these conditions depends on composition, since only those species containing P-V as heteroatom appeared to be stable. All Si-IV and Co(III)( )derivates showed rapid decomposition, regardless their nuclearity or molecular structure. All stable derivatives exhibited consistent activity, favored by high nuclearity and overall total charge, with Keggin derivatives being intrinsically more active than the corresponding Dawson-Wells analogues.

Qualitative and quantitative analyses enable obtaining chemical compositions including the relative and absolute concentrations of specific elements and chemical bonds near the surface of or deep inside the material of interest. More importantly, these techniques help us to access the interface of a polymer and a solid material at a molecular level in a polymer nanocomposite. The collective interpretation of all this information leads us to a better understanding of why specific material properties can be modulated in composite geometry. Finally, we will highlight the impacts of the use of these spectroscopic methods in recent advances in polymer nanocomposite materials for various nano- and bio-applications.									25	0	0	0	3	1	25				2073-4360		WOS:000541431100058	32375363

The determination of glucose in 0.05 M NaOH solution with high sensitivity was performed using cyclic voltammetry (CV) and amperometry (i-t). The fundamental electrochemical parameters were analyzed and the obtained values of diffusion coefficient (D), heterogeneous rate constant (k(s)), electroactive surface coverage (?), and transfer coefficient (alpha-) are 1.75 x 10(-6) cm(2)/s, 57.65 M(-1)s(-1), 1.45 x 10(-10) mol/cm(2), and 0.52 respectively. The peak current of the i-t method shows two dynamic linear ranges of calibration curves 0.2 to 3.5 mu M and 0.5 to 250 mu M for the glucose electro-oxidation. The Ni2+/Ni3+ couple with the HCNiO electrode and the electrocatalytic properties were found to be sensitive to the glucose oxidation. The green chemistry of NiO preparation from bacteria and the high catalytic ability of the oxyhydroxide (NiOOH) is the good choice for the development of a glucose sensor. The best obtained sensitivity and limit of detection (LOD) for this sensor were 3978.9 mu A mM(-1)cm(-2) and 0.9 mu M, respectively.									13	0	0	0	5	0	13				1422-0067		WOS:000381500900119	27409615

JrGSTTau1 was induced by 16, 12, 10, 8, and 6 degrees C stresses. The transiently transformed J. regia showed much greater GST, glutathione peroxidase (GPX), superoxide dismutase (SOD), and peroxidase (POD) activities and lower H2O2, malondialdehyde (MDA), reactive oxygen species (ROS), and electrolyte leakage (EL) rate than prokII (empty vector control) and RNAi::JrGSTTau1 under cold stress, indicating that JrGSTTau1 may be involved in chilling tolerance. To further confirm the role of JrGSTTau1, JrGSTTau1 was heterologously expressed in tobacco, transgenic Line5, Line9, and Line12 were chosen for analysis. The germinations of WT, Line5, Line9, and Line12 were similar, but the fresh weight, primary root length, and total chlorophyll content (tcc) of the transgenic lines were significantly higher than those of WT under cold stress. When cultivated in soil, the GST and SOD activities of transgenic tobacco were significantly higher than those of WT; however, the MDA and H2O2 contents of WT were on average 1.47- and 1.96-fold higher than those of Line5, Line9, and Line12 under 16 degrees C. The DAB, Evans blue, and PI staining further confirmed these results. Furthermore, the abundances of NtGST, MnSOD, NtMAPK9, and CDPK15 were elevated in 35S::JrGSTTau1 tobacco compared with WT. These results suggested that JrGSTTau1 improves the plant chilling tolerance involved in protecting enzymes, ROS scavenging, and stress-related genes, indicating that JrGSTTau1 is a candidate gene for the potential application in molecular breeding to enhance plant abiotic stress tolerance.									33	8	0	0	32	0	42			0721-7714	1432-203X		WOS:000371241100015	26687965

The development of effective photocatalysts, especially the metal-free photocatalysts, is a critical determinant of this technique. The recently emerged 2D material of black phosphorus with distinctive properties of tunable direct bandgap, ultrahigh charge mobility, fortified optical absorption, large specific surface area, and anisotropic structure has captured enormous attention since the first exfoliation of bulk black phosphorus into mono- or few layered phosphorene in 2014. In this article, the state-of-the-art preparation methods are first summarized for bulk black phosphorus, phosphorene, and black phosphorus quantum dot and then the fundamental structure and electronic and optical properties are analyzed to evaluate its feasibility as a metal-free photocatalyst. Various modifications on black phosphorus are also summarized to enhance its photocatalytic performance.

J	Cawthorn, R. G.								Geological interpretations from the PGE distribution in the Bushveld Merensky and UG2 chromitite reefs								JOURNAL OF THE SOUTHERN AFRICAN INSTITUTE OF MINING AND METALLURGY				111	2			67	79						FEB 2011	2011	The vertical distribution of platinum-group elements (PGE) in the Merensky and UG2 chromitite Reefs is highly variable, but does follow certain general patterns that allow the testing of geological models. In the,Merensky reef, historically popular geological representations and interpretations have Suggested that the mineralization occurs in a pegmatitic pyroxenite bounded by two chromitite layers. However, there are now enough published exceptions to this relationship to expose its fallacy. The vertical distribution of the PGE depends largely upon the separation between these two chromitite layers or the absence of one chromitite layer. Where separation is small or only one chromitite layer is present, there is considerable PGE mineralization in the footwall below the pyroxenite and lower chromitite layer. With increasing separation between the two chromitites, the mineralization occurs progressively higher in the succession, and tends to track the upper chromitite layer. The view presented here is that the entire Merensky package is comprised of three events of magma emplacement, In which each has produced variable reaction with, and erosion of the footwall, causing recrystallization of pyroxenite :into pegmatitic pyroxenite. The magma then produced a chromitite layer followed by pyroxenite. Each chromitite layer is associated with some mineralization, which was extensively complemented by the subsequent formation of a sulphide liquid carrying PGE that trickled down through about 1 m of permeable crystal pile. The sulphide liquid formed after, not coincident with, the pyroxenite layers.The distribution of PGE in the UG2 chromitite shows up to three upward depletion sequences of PGE, also Suggesting three events. The PGE are associated only with the chromite. The contribution from a sulphide liquid is considered to have been minimal for two reasons. Cu and Ni are extremely low in the UG2 which would not be expected if sulphides had been present. Also, by analogy with the Merensky, downward trickling of sulphides would have caused some PGE to be present in the footwall. There are some PGE in the footwall, but only where remnants of chromitite occur, and the hanging wall is lacking in PGE.In the northeastern Bushveld the UG2 chromitite is thinner than elsewhere, and there is a UG3 chromitite layer, not present elsewhere, that has a high Pt/Pd ratio. It is surmized that in the rest of the Bushveld the UG3 only appears to be absent because it has merged with the UG2 to produce the high Pt concentration at the top of the composite UG2. The non-accumulation of the package of pyroxenite-norite-anorthosite between the UG2 and UG3 in the northeastern Bushveld, which is not seen elsewhere, creates an interesting challenge to the formation of silicate layering in the complex. The mineralization in the Platreef is not addressed here.									24	1	0	0	2	2	27			2225-6253	2411-9717		WOS:000289701500003

In this work, n-type SiNWs (n-SiNWs) are obtained via metal-catalyzed electroless etching. To improve the photoelectrochemical performance of the n-SiNWs, g-C3N4 is deposited on their surface as a coating layer (n-SiNW/g-C3N4). Furthermore, to increase the density of active sites in g-C3N4, barbituric acid (BA) is introduced into precursors before the layer deposition. The n-SiNW/g-C3N4 photoanode shows a negative shift of the onset potential as compared to the bare n-SiNWs. Moreover, a 50% enhancement in the photocurrent density at 1.6 V vs. RHE is achieved on the BA-modified n-SiNW/g-C3N4 as compared to the pristine n-SiNW/g-C3N4.									13	0	0	0	0	0	13			1388-2481	1873-1902		WOS:000424295300004

The PsbS protein has recently been implicated as the site for non-photochemical quenching. Based both on immunoblotting analyses and structural considerations of an improved model of the spinach LHC II-PS II supercomplex, we conclude that the PsbS protein is not located within the supercomplex. Analyses of other fractions resulting from the solubilization of PS II-enriched membranes derived from spinach suggest that the PsbS protein is located in the LHC II-rich regions that interconnect the supercomplex within the membrane.									63	0	0	0	55	0	63			0962-8436	1471-2970		WOS:000165153100002	11127988

The as-prepared CdS-Cu9S5-CF is demonstrated to be a highly efficient catalyst for photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting, and its high performance is attributed to its unique cactus-shaped structure, which provides abundant surface catalytic active sites, and numerous charge transfer channels, thereby enhancing the transport and separation of photoinduced charge carriers during the PEC process. The optimized 3% CdS-Cu9S5-CF (the mole ratio of CdS: Cu9S5 = 3: 100) exhibits higher photocurrent density than those of pure Cu9S5 and other CdS-Cu9S5-CF catalysts because the synergetic effects between Cu9S5 and CdS can significantly inhibit the recombination of photoinduced charge carriers during the PEC process. We believe that the new synthetic route developed in this study will enable the facile preparation of metal sulfide-based catalysts for high-efficiency PEC water splitting.									19	2	0	0	2	0	20			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000489699700093

We adapt the use of the transmission-line model for porous electrodes in conjunction with electrochemical impedance spectroscopy measurements of the cell in the H-2/N-2 mode known for fuel cells to PEWE cells to quantify proton transport resistance and double layer capacitance of the anode catalyst layer. Anode catalyst loading was varied between 0.05 and 3.2 mg(IrO2) cm(-2). A non-linear relationship was found between the anode IrO2 loading and the proton transport resistance. Catalyst layers with very low IrO2 loading (0.05-0.16 mg(IrO2) cm(-2)) had similar to 4 times higher mass-specific activity and similar to 2 times higher mass-specific capacitance, revealing an inhomogeneous utilization of the catalytic material. The kinetic and transport limitations associated with the anode catalyst layer have been correlated with its morphological features. (C) The Author(s) 2019.

Here, we review factors affecting excess iron distribution and its damage to specific tissues, as well as mechanisms of oncogenesis by iron. Although consequences of transfusional iron overload are best described in thalassemia major and related inherited anemias, they are increasingly recognized in acquired conditions, such as myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS). Iron overload in MDS not only impacts on certain tissues, but may affect the clonal evolution of MDS through generation of reactive oxygen species. Iron overload may also influence hematopoietic-stem-cell-transplantation outcomes. Novel MRI methods for assessing body iron have impacted significantly on outcome in inherited anemias by allowing monitoring of iron burden and iron chelation therapy. This approach is increasingly being used in MDS and stem-cell-transplant procedures. Knowledge gained from managing transfusional iron overload in inherited anemias may be translated to general oncology, with potential for improved patient outcomes.									38	1	0	0	19	1	40			1040-8428	1879-0461		WOS:000371937700026	26806144

Although the relation with subduction is obvious, the mechanisms of magma generation remain among the most debated topics in Earth Sciences today. The most outstanding features of these calc-alkaline batholiths are summarized in this review. The problem has been addressed by laboratory experiments along decades. Dispersed data from experimental studies are compiled here in order to give phase equilibria constraints of general application. It is apparent from chemical data that major-element compositional trends follow cotectic patterns whose composition is largely dependent on intensive variables. The comparison between experiments and batholith chemical trends produces an empirical thermodynamic framework useful to understand in a first approach the origin and evolution of magmas forming granite batholiths. A new projection scheme of rock compositions onto the pseudoternary plane defined by the Fe + Mg, anorthite, orthoclase, is given. This can be taken as first approach to phase equilibria model of batholiths. It has been revealed useful to distinguish processes controlled by increasing (melting) or decreasing (crystallization) magma temperature from processes controlled by assimilation or magma mixing.The available experimental data, although scarce, can be used to tentatively depict phase equilibria in the projected pseudoternary F-An-Or diagram. Although important limitations are imposed by the projective procedure, phase equilibria relations in equilibrium with liquids can be drafted in the diagram. The stability fields of mineral in areas close to the liquid are defined according to reported phase assemblages in the experimental studies of reference. The diagram is robust to identify cotectic and non-cotectic relations.Phase equilibrium constraints and rock textures have revealed that one of the most important parameter controlling phase equilibria in granite magmas is the initial water content. Typically, calc-alkaline granitoids, from Qtz-diorite to granotonalite and granite, have crystallized from strongly undersaturated (water) magmas. Low initial water contents (W-i) in the range 1-2 wt.% H2O may account for residual saturated melt fractions as low as 0.1-0.2 for plutons emplaced at 400 MPa. The water content of these residual melt fractions is enough to stabilize hydrous minerals, namely Hbl and Bt as predicted by experiments. The initial water content is a primary feature of the magma and it is directly related to the melting reaction and, more precisely, to the temperature of magma generation.The study of compositional trends supports magma fractionation by crystal-liquid separation as a relevant role. As a first approach, the pressure-composition relations in the melts can be seen as a response to the composition of the solid saturating assemblage, and particularly related to the ratio Grt/Pl in the solid residue.

These electrodes are proposed to function as dimensionally stable anodes (DSAs). For Ti/TiO2/Pt electrodes, Pt is deposited within some of the micropores of the oxide film. In contrast, for Ti/TiO2/Ir, the metal is deposited preferentially on the top surface. This difference is thought to result from the position of the metal deposition potential with respect to the flat band potential of n-TiO2. Optical imaging of both types of DSA suggests that only a few sites on the surface are responsible for electron exchange at the DSA-electrolyte interface. C-AFM measurements of Ti/TiO2/Pt samples subjected to long-term anodic polarisation, suggest that the Ti-noble metal contact is progressively insulated by thickening of the TiO2 barrier layer, promoting passivation of the DSA. For Ir coated anodes, catalytic activity is directly related to the presence of Ir and to the stability of the catalytic oxide layer. Under Cu electrowinning conditions, the electrochemically formed hydrated Ir oxide was found to be catalytically less stable, than the iridium oxide film subjected to a heat treatment.

Here, we address this challenge by Br-induced formation of P-poor defective nickel phosphide and show that the H adsorption energy can be optimized by regulating the vacancy concentration. We show that when such defective Ni12P5-xBrx nanoparticles are distributed on the surface of Ni2P nanosheets (Ni12P5-xBrx/Ni2P NS), excellent catalytic activity for water splitting is obtained in alkaline media. Density functional theory computations revealed that Br doping induce the formation of a P-poor nickel phosphide with vacancies, leading to an optimal H adsorption strength with a volcano-type relationship. This is the best reported for a non-precious metal phosphide at present: the overpotential for HER is 18 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) and 155 mV for OER. This leads to an exceptionally low cell voltage requirement of only 1.44 V to drive overall water splitting in an alkaline electrolyzer.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000862449900003

Herein, a series of Cu catalysts supported on boron-doped carbon nanotubes (Cu/xB-CNTs) were prepared for the hydrogenation of dimethyl oxalate (DMO) to ethanol. The structure and chemical properties of boron-doped catalysts were characterized by XRD, TEM, N2O pulse adsorption, CO chemisorption, H-2 temperature-programmed reduction, and NH3 temperature-programmed desorption, which revealed that doping boron into CNT supports improved the Cu dispersion, strengthened the interaction of Cu species with the CNT support, introduced more surface acid sites, and increased the surface area of Cu-0 and especially Cu+ sites. Consequently, the catalytic activity and stability of the catalysts were greatly enhanced by boron doping. 100% DMO conversion and 78.1% ethanol selectivity could be achieved over the Cu/1B-CNTs catalyst, the ethanol selectivity of which was almost 1.7 times higher than that of the catalyst without boron doping. These results suggest that doping CNTs with boron is an efficient approach to improve the catalytic performance of CNT-based catalysts for hydrogenation of DMO. The boron-doped CNT-based catalyst with improved ethanol selectivity and catalytic stability will be helpful in the development of efficient Cu catalysts supported on non-silica materials for selective hydrogenation of DMO to ethanol.									32	5	0	0	3	0	36			0947-6539	1521-3765		WOS:000403570500023	28421629

Mn oxidation has been reported in various microorganisms. Several possible pathways, indirect or direct, have been proposed. A wider variety of Mn-reducing microorganisms, from highly aerobic to strictly anaerobic, has been described. The mechanisms of Mn reduction can be either an indirect process resulting from interactions with organic or inorganic compounds, or a direct enzymatic (electron-transfer) reaction. The role of microorganisms in Mn cycle is now well demonstrated by various methods in superficial natural environments, and research has been initiated on subsurface sediments. Observations in vivo (Rhone valley) and under in vitro suggested that bacterial activities are the main processes that promote manganese evolution and migration in shallow aquifers. After the building of hydroelectric dams, the stream of the Rhone was modified, giving rise to mud deposition on the bank. In the mud, bacteria are stimulated by the high organic content and consume oxygen. The redox potential drops. The manganese oxides previously formed under aerobic conditions are reduced and soluble manganese (Mn(II)) migrates into the aquifer. If the subsurface sediments are coarse-grained, the aquifer is well aerated, allowing the re-oxidation of Mn(II) by the oligotrophic attached bacteria in aquifer sediments. If the aquifer is confined, aeration is not sufficient for Mn-reoxidation. Mn(II) remains in a reduced state and migrates to the wells. Furthermore, the presence of organic matter in subsurface sediments results in the reduction of previously formed Mn oxides. Pseudo-amorphous manganese oxides, which were probably recently formed by bacteria, are more readily reduced than old crystalline manganese oxides. Although the concentrations of soluble manganese found in groundwaters are not toxic, it still is a problem since its oxidation results in darkening of water and plugging of pipes in drinking or industrial water systems. Soluble manganese can be removed from water by biological processes involving manganese-oxidizing bacteria, either in situ, or in sand filters after pumping. Various procedures are mentioned.									85	3	0	0	57	0	90			0168-6445	1574-6976		WOS:A1994PC29400008	7917421

The spectra were essentially the same for oxygen-evolving PS II and Mn-depleted PS II. The radicals were generated by illumination given at low temperatures, and the ENDOR spectra were attributed to Car(.+) and Chl(z)(.+) on the basis of their characteristic behavior with temperature as demonstrated earlier [Hanley et al. (1999) Biochemistry 38, 8189-8195]: i.e., (a) the Car(.+) alone was generated by illumination at less than or equal to 20 K, while Chl(z)(.+) alone was generated at 200 K, and (b) warming of the sample containing the Car(.+) to 200 K resulted in the loss of the signal attributable to Car(.+) and its replacement by a spectrum attributable to the Chl(z)(.+). A map of the hyperfine structure of Car(.+) in PS II and in organic solvent was obtained. The largest observed hyperfine splitting for Car(.+) in either environment was in the order of 8-9 MHz. Thus, the spin density on the cation is proposed to be delocalized over the carotenoid molecule. The pulsed ENDOR spectrum of Chl(z)(.+) was compared to that obtained from a Chl a cation in frozen organic solvent. The hyperfine coupling constants attributed to the beta -protons at position 17 and 18 are well resolved from Chl(z)(.+) in PS II (10.8 and 14.9 MHz) but not in Chl a(.+) in organic solvent (12.5 MHz). This suggests a more defined conformation of ring IV with respect to the rest of the tetrapyrrole ring plane of Chl(z)(.+) than Chl a(.+) probably induced by the protein matrix.									36	0	0	0	19	0	36			0006-2960			WOS:000166496900004	11148025

In all investigated organisms, metabolic pathways, and more particularly glycolysis, are specifically enriched for functionally redundant paralogs. In ancestors of the Saccharomyces lineage, the duplication of glycolytic genes is purported to have played an important role leading to S. cerevisiae's current lifestyle favoring fermentative metabolism even in the presence of oxygen and characterized by a high glycolytic capacity. In modern S. cerevisiae strains, the 12 glycolytic reactions leading to the biochemical conversion from glucose to ethanol are encoded by 27 paralogs. In order to experimentally explore the physiological role of this genetic redundancy, a yeast strain with a minimal set of 14 paralogs was constructed (the "minimal glycolysis" [MG] strain). Remarkably, a combination of a quantitative systems approach and semiquantitative analysis in a wide array of growth environments revealed the absence of a phenotypic response to the cumulative deletion of 13 glycolytic paralogs. This observation indicates that duplication of glycolytic genes is not a prerequisite for achieving the high glycolytic fluxes and fermentative capacities that are characteristic of S. cerevisiae and essential for many of its industrial applications and argues against gene dosage effects as a means of fixing minor glycolytic paralogs in the yeast genome.

The increase in frequency and severity of disease outbreaks has made evaluating and determining coral resistance a priority. Phylogenetic patterns in immunity and disease can provide important insight to how corals may respond to current and future environmental and/or biologically induced diseases. The purpose of this study was to determine if immunity, number of diseases and disease prevalence show a phylogenetic signal among Caribbean corals. We characterized the constitutive levels of six distinct innate immune traits in 14 Caribbean coral species and tested for the presence of a phylogenetic signal on each trait. Results indicate that constitutive levels of some individual immune related processes (i.e. melanin concentration, peroxidase and inhibition of bacterial growth), as well as their combination show a phylogenetic signal. Additionally, both the number of diseases affecting each species and disease prevalence (as measures of disease burden) show a significant phylogenetic signal. The phylogenetic signal of immune related processes, combined with estimates of species divergence times, indicates that among the studied species, those belonging to older lineages tend to resist/fight infections better than more recently diverged coral lineages. This result, combined with the increasing stressful conditions on corals in the Caribbean, suggest that future reefs in the region will likely be dominated by older lineages while modern species may face local population declines and/or geographic extinction.									21	0	0	0	21	0	21			1932-6203			WOS:000341302700042	25133685

This unique nanomeshes/nanosheets structure with large SSA (153.92 m(2)/g) possessed an abundance of accessible active sites and large area intimate interfaces between Co3O4 and g-C3N4, thus remarkably promoting the separation and transport of charge carriers. The as-prepared optimal 10% Co3O4/g-C3N4 composites exhibited excellent degradation efficiency toward tetracycline (TC) under visible light irradiation and were further enhanced with the addition of PMS. The mechanism of the enhanced TC degradation in Co3O4/g-C3N4/Vis/PMS system was investigated in detail based on the characterization of the catalysts, TC degradation efficiency assessment, electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) measurements, and reactive oxygen species (ROSs) quenching results. The TC degradation pathway was proposed based on the intermediates identified by the gas chromatography-mass spectrometer (GC-MS) measurements. This study provides a facile and promising path for the remediation of contaminated water via PMS mediated photocatalysis over highly active g-C3N4-based catalysts.									70	3	0	0	22	0	72			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000561587100002

The microscale morphology and physical composition of the fabricated electrodes are characterized by scanning electron microscopy and x-ray diffraction. Cyclic voltammetry tests are also performed to evaluate the electrochemical performance. The experimental data showed that the electrochemical characterization of prepared Ti/Sn-Sb-RuOx electrodes was inversely related to the calcination temperature. The surface morphology was a block crack structure. As the calcination temperature increased, the crack gradually broadened and deepened. The diffraction peak of RuO2 rised to the maximum at 500 degrees C. The temperature continued to rise, the diffraction peak of RuO2 decreased. The electrode prepared at 500 degrees C had the largest voltammetric capacity and a larger electrochemical active area. The service life of the electrodes prepared at 500 degrees C was longer than that of the electrode prepared at other temperatures.									1	1	0	0	0	0	2			2053-1591			WOS:000484134600002

The production cost can be minimized, if the cell module is operated with the minimum voltage at maximum current density. In the present study, porous nickel electrodes were developed indigenously on an engineering scale and used in an advanced zero gap filter press type bipolar electrolyser to minimize the cell voltage. As the cell voltage current density characteristic of the cell module is unique feature of its design and the operating parameters, the polarization experiments were carried out using this cell module and the cell voltage current density characteristics were generated at different operating temperatures. Further, the system is modelled for its electrochemical performance and the parameters accounting for different losses such as Ohmic and activation over potential, were estimated at different temperatures. These different parameters were compared with the data existing in literature and based on the analysis, the present cell module is found to be superior to the existing commercial electrolyzers in terms of energy efficiency.

CO adsorption on Pt clusters supported on graphite								JOURNAL OF ELECTROANALYTICAL CHEMISTRY				716		SI		23	30		10.1016/j.jelechem.2013.09.025				MAR 1 2014	2014	Density functional theory calculations are used to characterize the influence of the nanoparticle-substrate interaction on CO adsorption in various Pt cluster sizes. Adsorption energies are evaluated on different sites of clusters supported on graphite and on unsupported clusters. Charge transfer and density of states are examined in order to determine the influence of the support on the cluster electronic properties. In comparison with adsorption on substrate-free cluster, we find weaker CO adsorption energy when CO is adsorbed on top of the cluster and stronger adsorption energy when CO is adsorbed on sites near the surface. The substrate has a larger influence on CO adsorption in sub-nanometer clusters; however some effect is detected in a 1 nm-diameter cluster. The graphite support has the capacity to accept electrons from the deposited cluster, but can donate electrons when the cluster adsorbs CO. The density of states of the CO molecule when it is adsorbed on clusters with different carbon substrates shows particular features that reveal the capacity of the support to influence CO adsorption.

Cell turnover rates are frequently linked to their functions, resource availability and telomere dynamics. Using male red-sided garter snakes, Thamnophis sirtalis parietalis, as a model, we investigated the relationship between telomere length in sperm cells, blood cells telomere length and a growth proxy (age-adjusted body length and mass). This relationship is interesting because snakes exhibit indeterminate growth and because these garter snakes have a dissociated reproductive cycle where spermatogenesis occurs months prior to the mating season. In this study, we determined sperm telomere length (STL) and male age using qPCR and skeletochronology, respectively. Sperm telomere length correlated positively with snout-vent length (SVL) and with age-adjusted SVL as a proxy for growth rate (residuals of size against age regression, hereafter growth), but not with age. Although an individual's STL is correlated with blood telomere length (BTL), sperm telomeres are 60% longer than blood telomeres. In previous work, we have shown that BTL is shorter in older males and unrelated to SVL or any growth rate proxies. We hypothesized that STL is related to growth and SVL because growth and sperm production both occur during summer when resources are most abundant and stress lowest. This study is the first to compare telomere dynamics between cell types in a snake and supports growing evidence that telomere dynamics may be highly tissue-specific and driven by the life-history strategy of an organism.									3	0	0	0	2	0	3			0952-8369	1469-7998		WOS:000532988100001

Density functional theory calculation and spectroscopic analyses demonstrate a stronger interfacial electronic coupling and greater charge transfer of polar MnO2 with hydrophilic Ti3C2 nanosheet than with hydrophobic rGO one, which maximizes the hybridization effect with the conductive nanosheet. Also, hybridization with Ti3C2 nanosheet is more effective in enhancing the ion diffusivity and porosity of MnO2 than that with strongly self-stacking rGO, which is attributable to weaker self-stacking tendency of Ti3C2. Due to these hybridization effects, the MnO2-Ti3C2 nanohybrid delivers larger specific capacitance with improved rate performance than does the MnO2-rGO nanohybrid, underscoring higher efficiency of MXene hybridization in improving electrode performance. This study clearly demonstrates that exfoliated MXene nanosheet can act as a superior hybridization matrix over rGO to explore strongly-coupled nanohybrids with improved energy-related functionality.									26	1	0	0	1	0	26			2211-2855	2211-3282		WOS:000448994600092

The morphological outcome was directed by varying the molar ratio of metal precursor Co(Ac)(2) and DNA and three different sets of CoS-DNA molecular hybrids, viz. CoS-DNA(0.036), CoS-DNA(0.06), and CoS-DNA(0.084) were prepared. These morphologically distinct hybrids had shown similar electrocatalytic behavior, because of the fact that they all contained the same cobalt content. The CoSDNA(0.036), CoS-DNA(0.06), and CoS-DNA(0.084) required very low overpotentials of 350, 364, and 373 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) (1 M KOH), respectively. The advantages of lower overpotential, lower Tafel slope (42.7 mV dec(-1).), high Faradaic efficiency (90.28%), high stability and reproducibility after all, with a lower cobalt loading, have certainly shown the worth of these molecular hybrids in large-scale water oxidation. Moreover, since DNA itself a good binder, CoS-DNA molecular hybrids were directly casted on substrate electrodes and used after drying. It also showed minimum intrinsic resistance as DNA is a good ionic and electronic conductor. Besides, the present method may also be extended for the preparation of other active electrocatalysts for water splitting.									70	0	0	0	3	0	70			0020-1669	1520-510X		WOS:000402950600077	28493681

Studies on Pb-Sm alloys (Sm = 0.02, 0.04, and 0.12 wt.%) indicate that the oxide film formed on the alloy surface at 0.9 V is thicker than that on pure lead when the alloy contained less than 0.1 wt.% Sm. In addition, samarium exercises little influence on the conversion of PbSO4 to PbO2 in the oxide film during charging. The electrochemical impedance of the oxide film is much larger than that of the oxide formed on pure lead. With the addition of more than 0.1 % Sm, however, the oxide film on the alloy surface is thinner and samarium, obviously promotes the conversion of passive PbSO4 in oxide film to conductive PbO2. The a.c. impedance data show that a high content of samarium greatly inhibits the growth of the passivation layer and decreases the electrochemical impedance of the film. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V.

Herein, we report a novel CN nanoribbon (CNNR) assembled seaweed-like architecture by microwave synthesis using the melamine-cyanuric acid supramolecular (MCS) as the precursor. The preparation process is facile, fast (< 30 min.) and green. The as-prepared CNNR is stable with a large specific area and exhibits a decreased bandgap of 2.5 eV as well as 52.2 times higher kinetic constant for Rhodamine B (RhB) degradation than that of bulk CN. The CNNR also shows highly efficient degradation for methylene blue (MB), methyl orange (MO), and tetracycline (TC). The significantly enhanced photocatalytic property of CNNR is mainly attributed to the synergistic effects of superior structure, O doping, and proper N defects. The result has shed a light on realizing the practical application of CN based photocatalysts.									63	2	0	0	6	0	63			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000517665200015

The electrodeposition mechanism of 3D-Ti/PbO2 electrode was investigated by cyclic voltammetry (CV) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). Scanning electron microscope (SEM) result showed that the 3D-Ti/PbO2 electrode possessed porous structure when it was electrodeposited for time less than 30 min. The 3D-Ti/PbO2 electrode prepared for 10 min had more active sites than the lead dioxide electrode electrodeposited on planar titanium substrate (denoted as 2D-Ti/PbO2 electrode) and its electrochemical porosity is about 54%. The embedded structure between porous Ti/SnO2-Sb2O5 substrate and PbO2 coating increased the stability of 3D-Ti/PbO2 electrode. The service life of 3D-Ti/PbO2 electrode was about 350 h which was much longer than 2D-Ti/PbO2 electrode. What's more, 3D-Ti/PbO2 electrode had better electrocatalytic activity towards phenol degradation than 2D-Ti/PbO2 electrode. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Highly active anodes containing Ir-black catalyst and submicronic Ti4O7 are manufactured through screen printing technique. Several vehicle solvents, including ethane 1,2-dial; propane-1,2-diol and cyclohexanol are investigated. Suitable functional anodic layer with iridium loading as low as 0.4 mg cm(-2) is obtained. Surface properties of the deposited layers are investigated by atomic force microscopy (AFM). The most homogeneous coating with the highest electronic conductivity is obtained using cyclohexanol. Tests in PEM electrolyzer operating at 1.7 V and 40 degrees C demonstrate that the CCM with anode coated with cyclohexanol presents a 1.5-fold higher Ir-mass activity than that of the commercial CCM.

All the heterostructures are formed by van der Waals forces. The MoS2/Mg(OH)(2) and WS2/Mg(OH)(2) vdW heterostructures were found to be semiconductors with indirect bandgaps and possess intrinsic type-II band alignment. In particular, a comparison of the band edge positions with the redox potential of water indicates that the heterostructures are potential photocatalysts for water splitting, enabling water reduction on the MX2 layer and water oxidation on the Mg(OH)(2) layer. Moreover, the photogenerated charges will be effectively separated in the presence of a large built-in electric field across the interface.

Among the various donors used for PS 1 assays, the 2,6-dichlorophenolindophenol (DCPIPH2) supported electron transport was not inhibited even at a pre-heated temperature of 50-degrees-C while the N, N, N', N'-tetramethyl-1,4-phenylenediamine (TMPDH2) and 3,6-diaminodurol (DADH2) supported rates were reduced to about 60 % of the maximum rate. Th stimulation by an uncoupler NH4Cl varied for PS 2 and PS 1 assayed in pre-heated thylakoids. PS 2 lost its sensitivity to NH4Cl after the thylakoids were pre-heated at 30-degrees-C while PS 1 retained some sensitivity to the uncoupler up to the 45-degrees-C pre-treatment. The capacity for the proton uptake during methyl viologen (non-cyclic) or pyocyanin (cyclic) mediated electron transport showed differential sensitivity to thermal stress. In thylakoids treated at 35-degrees-C the extent of non-cyclic electron transport supported proton-uptake was inhibited by 80 % while the cyclic pyocyanin mediated proton uptake was reduced by less than 15 %.									9	0	0	0	6	0	9			0300-3604			WOS:A1991FZ57400015

Since the price of hydrogen produced by PEWE is dominated by the price of electricity, it is crucial to ensure low degradation rates during the lifetime of a PEWE stack. This study aims to shed light onto the effects of cationic impurities that are responsible for the water impurity related failures of a majority of commercial stacks by employing operando neutron imaging coupled with electrochemical impedance spectroscopy measurements. A detailed overpotential analysis is conducted to elucidate how different voltage losses are triggered depending on the relative position of the cationic contaminant in the catalyst coated membrane.

We here report a robust strategy for fabricating 2D Ir-based ultrathin nanosheets (NSs) (1.3 nm) without capping agents through the thermal treatment of ZnIr(OH)(6) perovskite hydroxide. Encouragingly, the created ultrathin Ir-based NSs exhibit high stability against a high temperature (e.g., 300 degrees C) and excellent performance towards overall water splitting. The cell voltages for reaching 10 mA cm(-2) are as low as 1.482 and 1.508 V in alkaline and acidic electrolytes, respectively, which are significantly lower than those of commercial Pt/C||IrOx (1.548 V in alkaline and 1.553 V in acidic electrolytes). This work not only provides a facile strategy for the synthesis of capping agent-free 2D Ir-based NSs, but also promotes the fundamental research studies on catalyst design for electrocatalysis and beyond.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			1754-5692	1754-5706		WOS:000771050200001

However, obtaining high photocatalytic activity from metal-free catalysts without the use of sacrificial electron donors is difficult. Herein, g-C3N4 (CN) nanotubes functionalized with surface > OH groups that are grafted in situ were successfully synthesized via a novel alkalinization process. The nanotube structures provide a large surface area and improved mass transfer properties. In situ grafted > OH groups can capture photogenerated holes to promote separation of photogenerated charge, enabling the ready availability of electrons and hydrogen ions for H2O2 production. Further, the surface > OH groups help to suppress H2O2 self-decomposition. Consequently, a high rate of 240.36 mu mol h(-1) g(-1) of H2O2 production can be achieved without sacrificial agents, which is the highest H2O2 production in a spontaneous system for metal-free photocatalysts. This work provides a new strategy for an efficient and spontaneous H2O2 production method using a metal-free CN photocatalyst.									40	2	0	0	10	0	40			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000632996500006

In this work, three-dimensional (3D)-ordered mesoporous iron-doped cobalt phosphide (meso-Co2-xFexP) was prepared by a nanocasting strategy using SBA-15 as the hard template combined with a subsequent phosphidation. The unique mesoporous structure of themeso-Co2-xFexP electrocatalyst resulted in the exposure of abundant active sites and favorable mass transfer for the electrocatalytic process. Due to the synergy effects of the mesoporous structure and ternary component, themeso-Co2-xFexP exhibited outstanding electrocatalytic activity with low overpotentials of 93.7 mV and 266.4 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2)for HER and OER, respectively. In addition,meso-Co2-xFexP showed excellent overall water splitting activity with an external voltage of 1.58 V at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2), superior to the electrolytic cell consisting of 20% Pt/C and RuO2, demonstrating it has great potential for practical application in overall water splitting.									12	0	0	0	0	0	12			2052-1553			WOS:000558029000010

Hence, by means of comprehensive density functional theory (DFT) computations, we investigated the potential of a new class of metal-organic frameworks (MOF)-based catalyst for the NRR, namely, the synthesized pi-conjugated metal bis(dithiolene) nanosheet (MC4S4, M = Fe, Co, Ni, Ru, Rh, Pd, Pt, Os, and Ir). Our results demonstrated that the NRR catalytic activity of MC4S4 is highly dependent on the central metal atom. Due to the low overpotential (0.31 V), the OsC4S4 nanosheet is predicted to exhibit outstanding NRR catalytic activity through the distal mechanism, in which the hydrogenation of the activated N-2 molecule to the N2H* species is identified as the potential-determining step. Our work is the first report of 2D MOF-based electrocatalyst for N(2 )reduction, opening a new avenue for advancing sustainable NH3 synthesis under ambient conditions.									26	1	0	0	1	0	26			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000471996400096

In this communication, core-shell CoFe2O4@Co-Fe-Bi nanoarray on carbon cloth (CoFe2O4@CoFe-Bi/CC) was successfully fabricated by in situ surface amorphization of CoFe2O4 nanoarray on CC (CoFe2O4/CC). As a 3D water oxidation electrode, CoFe2O4@Co-Fe-Bi/CC shows outstanding activity with an overpotential of 460 mV to drive a geometrical catalytic current density of 10 mA cm(-2) in 0.1 M potassium borate ( pH 9.2). Notably, it also demonstrates superior long-term durability for at least 20 h with 96% Faradic efficiency. Density functional theory calculations indicate that the conversion from OOH* to O-2 is the rate-limiting step and the high water oxidation activity of CoFe2O4@Co-Fe-Bi/CC is associated with the lower free energy of 1.84 eV on a Co-Fe-Bi shell.									47	2	0	0	1	0	47			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000403427300003	28561829

The nitrogen-doped graphene nanocomposites (N-rGO) were derived from pyrolysis of graphene oxide/polyaniline composites in nitrogen atmosphere. X-ray powder diffraction, FTIR spectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and Transmission and Scanning electron microscopy (TEM&SEM) were used to characterize the morphology and microstructure of the prepared catalysts. The TEM and elemental mapping images indicate that metal nanoparticles are more uniformly dispersed on the surface of N-doped graphene than other supports, and Pt nanoparticles dispersed without any aggregation. The catalytic activity and durability of the catalysts was evaluated by various electrochemical techniques. Compared to undoped Pt/rGO and commercial Pt/C catalysts, an enhanced electrocatalytic activity was obtained in the case of the Pt/N-rGO with optimized composition and nanostructure. The maximum power density of MEA for Pt/N-rGO was 1.4 times more than that of MEA fabricated by commercial Pt/C 20%. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

J	George, HL; VanEtten, HD								Characterization of pisatin-inducible cytochrome P450s in fungal pathogens of pea that detoxify the pea phytoalexin pisatin								FUNGAL GENETICS AND BIOLOGY				33	1			37	48		10.1006/fgbi.2001.1270				JUN 2001	2001	Many fungi that are pathogenic on pea have the ability to demethylate and thus detoxify the pea phytoalexin pisatin. This detoxification reaction has been studied most thoroughly in Nectria haematococca MP VI where it functions as a virulence trait. The enzyme catalyzing this reaction [pisatin demethylase (pda)] is a cytochrome P450. In the current study, the induction of whole-cell pda activity and the biochemical properties of pda in microsomal preparations from the pea pathogens Ascochyta pisi, Mycosphaerella pinodes, and Phoma pinodella are compared to the pda produced by N. haematococca. Based on cofactor requirements and their inhibition by carbon monoxide, cytochrome P450 inhibitors, and antibodies to NAD-PH:cytochrome P450 reductase, we conclude that the pdas from the other pea pathogens also are cytochrome P450s. All of the enzymes show a rather selective induction by pisatin, have a low K-m toward pisatin, and have a fairly high degree of specificity toward pisatin as a substrate, suggesting that each pathogen may have a specific cytochrome P450 for detoxifying this plant antibiotic. Since the pdas in these fungi differ in their pattern of sensitivity to P450 inhibitors and display other minor biochemical differences, we suggest that these fungi may have independently evolved a specialized cytochrome P450 as a virulence trait for a common host.

J	Zhang, Gongxi; Liu, Wenyuan; Chen, Jianyong; Shen, Shengping					Shen, Shengping/0000-0002-9237-4995			Nonlinear electrochemomechanical modelling of electrochemical strain microscopy imaging								NANOTECHNOLOGY				31	31					315704	10.1088/1361-6528/ab898c				JUL 31 2020	2020	Electrochemical strain microscopy (ESM) is a powerful tool to resolve ionic transport and electrochemical processes with a nanoscale resolution. To ascertain the underlying mechanism that governs the signal generation of ESM imaging, a fully coupled nonlinear electrochemomechanical model based on the finite element method is developed and applied to LiMn2O4 particles. The frequency dependence of the ESM response, in particular the response at high frequencies used in the detection regime, is investigated in detail. The performed analysis demonstrates that the error induced by the decoupling approximation increases with decreasing bias frequency due to the relatively large variation in ion concentration. In the high frequency regime, the results reveal that the stress effect is negligible and local electroneutrality holds, providing the simplification of numerical simulation for ESM imaging. By applying an alternative current voltage, we suggest that the detectable signal observed in ESM imaging can be attributed to the Vegard effect, which was controversial in previous linear models. The local distribution of ion concentration shows that the ionic reorganization only takes place near the tip-surface junction, the spatial extent of which can be described by two relevant lengths, the contact radius and ion drift length, which determine the spatial lateral resolution and depth resolution, respectively, in ESM imaging. Through a parametric study, the electromigration is proved to be dominant at high frequencies and the relationship between ESM amplitude and some parameters may offer a strategy to measure local electrochemical reactivity. The impact of contact force is evaluated and the results indicate that the local compression reduces ion concentration and the resultant ESM signal in the detection regime. Thus attention must be paid to the contact force when a comparison between different measurements is conducted. The combination of the numerical model and experiment holds the promise of quantitative probing of local electrochemical parameters in solids.									3	0	0	0	1	0	3			0957-4484	1361-6528		WOS:000536865900001	32294633

At the same time, uncontrolled interactions between iron and its surrounding milieu may be damaging to cells and tissues. Heme-the iron-chelated form of protoporphyrin IX-is a macrocyclic tetrapyrrole and a coordination complex for diatomic gases, accurately engineered by evolution to exploit the catalytic, oxygen-binding, and oxidoreductive properties of iron while minimizing its damaging effects on tissues. The majority of the body production of heme is ultimately incorporated into hemoglobin within mature erythrocytes; thus, regulation of heme biosynthesis by iron is central in erythropoiesis. Additionally, heme is a cofactor in several metabolic pathways, which can be modulated by iron-dependent signals as well. Impairment in some steps of the pathway of heme biosynthesis is the main pathogenetic mechanism of two groups of diseases collectively known as porphyrias and congenital sideroblastic anemias. In porphyrias, according to the specific enzyme involved, heme precursors accumulate up to the enzyme stop in disease-specific patterns and organs. Therefore, different porphyrias manifest themselves under strikingly different clinical pictures. In congenital sideroblastic anemias, instead, an altered utilization of mitochondrial iron by erythroid precursors leads to mitochondrial iron overload and an accumulation of ring sideroblasts in the bone marrow. In line with the complexity of the processes involved, the role of iron in these conditions is then multifarious. This review aims to summarise the most important lines of evidence concerning the interplay between iron and heme metabolism, as well as the clinical and experimental aspects of the role of iron in inherited conditions of altered heme biosynthesis.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0				2218-1989		WOS:000859034200001	36144223

With the continuous expansion of hydrogen production scale and the reduction in hydrogen production cost, hydrogen energy will become a competitive alternative energy, which can further promote the transformation of China's energy structure, reduce carbon emissions. and improve China's energy security and resilience. China is the world' s largest producer of hydrogen, and there are three main industrial hydrogen production routes in China: fossil fuel reforming, industrial by-product hydrogen and the electrolysis of water. Other new hydrogen production technologies, such as hydrogen production from solar photolysis, hydrogen production from biomass, hydrogen production from thermochemical circulation, etc., have attracted extensive attention and investigations. In addition, hydrogen production system is complex, which is difficult for modeling and optimization. Accordingly, artificial intelligence ( AI) shows unique advantages in the prediction. evaluation and optimization for hydrogen production system, which is promising and attractive. Based on the recent progress, this article summarizes several critical hydrogen production technologies into four main categories, and further proposes some perspectives for the future development of hydrogen supply structure in China. Finally, this article also reviewes the latest application of artificial intelligence in hydrogen production system to provide new insights for the development of hydrogen production technology in China.									0	2	0	0	0	0	2			1005-281X			WOS:000751871300005

In this study, we developed for the first time a tyramide signal amplification-fluorescence in situ hybridization-fluorescence-activated cell sorting protocol (TSA-FISH-FACS) for the characterization of all vanA carrying bacteria in wastewater samples. Firstly, we validated the TSA-FISH protocol through microscopy in pure cultures and wastewater influent. Then, samples were sorted and quantified by FACS and qPCR. Significantly higher percentage tagging of cells was detected in vanA carrying pure cultures and wastewater samples spiked with vanA carrying cells as compared to vanA negative Gram positive strains and non-spiked wastewater samples respectively. qPCR analysis targeting vanZ, a regulating gene in the vanA cluster, showed its relative abundance was significantly greater in Enterococcus faecium ATCC 700221-spiked and positively sorted samples compared to the E. faecium spiked and negatively sorted samples. Phylogenetic analysis was then performed. Although further efforts are needed to overcome technical problems, we have, for the first time, demonstrated sorting bacterial-cells carrying antibiotic resistance genes from wastewater samples through a TSA-FISH-FACS protocol and provided insight into the microbial ecology of vancomycin resistant bacteria. Future potential applications using this approach will include the separation of members of an environmental microbial community (cultured and hard-to-culture) to allow for metagenomics on single cells or, in the case of clumping, targeting a smaller portion of the community with a priori knowledge that the target gene is present.									4	0	0	0	2	0	4			0048-9697	1879-1026		WOS:000540002300005	32417556

In this work, we have explored the electronic properties of C-monodoped, C-Ge, and C-Sn codoped GaN nanosheets by the hybrid density functional theory in order to find the excellent photocatalytic materials. Results indicate the monodoping of C introduces unoccupied impurity states inside the band gap that serve on recombination centers. Thus, the C monodoping is not suitable to ameliorate visible light absorption. Moreover, the C-Ge and C-Sn codoping not only successfully reduce the band gap of nanosheet GaN but also avoid the unoccupied impurity states. The charge-compensated C-Ge and C-Sn codoped GaN nanosheets are energetically favorable for hydrogen evolution but not insufficient to produce oxygen, indicating that they could serve as Z-scheme photocatalysts. In particular, the minimum defect formation energy of C-Ge is negative and lowest. The C-Ge codoped GaN system has dynamic stability. So, the C-Ge codoped nanosheet GaN is one of the most prospective candidates for the decomposition of hydrogen from water.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			2296-8016			WOS:000546137500001

In this study, we first combine the advantages of carbon-supported Pt-type structures and MSD to prepare a carbon-sphere-supported Pt catalyst. Compare to conventional chemical methods, the Pt/C catalyst prepare by MSD has some characteristics such as easy to prepare, high Pt utilization, and non-polluting. The results demonstrate that the electrochemical surface area (ECSA) of the sputtered-Pt/ C is increased by 34% compare with the commercial-Pt/C with the same Pt loading. Moreover, the testing results for the single cell indicate that the rated power density of the sputtered-Pt/C catalyst is 26.7% higher than that of the commercial-Pt/C catalyst under H-2/air test conditions. We are optimistic that this sputtered-Pt/C catalyst could have broad applications in commercial fuel cells.

Herein, carbon-based materials with specific morphology (Bulks, Nanotubes and Nanosheets, respectively) confined Ni (0) and Ni-N-x active sites have been synthesized by using one Nickel-organic framework (Ni-MOF) as the precursor in high-temperature treatments under argon atmosphere (designated as Ni (0)/Ni-N-CBK, Ni (0)/Ni-N-CNT and Ni (0)/Ni-N-CNS, respectively). Interestingly, the key to obtaining a specific morphology of the carbon-based materials is altering the amount of additional nitrogen source (dicyandiamide, DCDA). The catalytic performance towards alpha, beta-unsaturated aldehyde hydrogenolysis demonstrates that the Ni (0)/Ni-N-CNT and Ni (0)/Ni -N-CNS possess superior selective hydrogenation activity and stability, which could be put down to the synergy effect of Ni (0) and single atomic Ni-N-x species.

The influence of the annealing temperature on the structure, surface morphology, surface composition, and capacitive performance was tested by XRD, SEM, EDX, XPS, CV, etc. The nonlinear equation q*(v)=A(1)exp((-v/t1)))+A(2)exp(((-v/t2)))+y(0) was used to calculate the active sites located inside and outside of the coatings. The results show that the critical crystallization temperature of IrO2-ZrO2 is between 340 similar to 360 degrees C. The phase of the coating annealed at 340 degrees C still remains amorphous. While annealing at 360 degrees C, the coatings contain both crystalline and amorphous structures. They have typical crack-like morphology and Ir3+, Ir4+, as well as higher valence Jr atoms. The specific capacitance increases with the increasing of temperature up to 360 degrees C, and then decreases with further increasing temperature. The electrodes annealed at 360 degrees C have the highest specific capacitance probably due to the optimal structures of "amorphous/crystalline mixture" which favor both electron and proton conductivity. The proton transfer has a greater influence on the capacitance than electronic conductivity. The effect of the CV scanning speed on proton migration is greatei than that on electronic conductivity.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1002-185X			WOS:000367768800052

The pollutant model MO solution was degraded and its photocatalytic activity was investigated under light. The results show that at a relatively low temperature, gC(3)N(4) is a rod-like structure, and NaOH plays a major role. With the increase of temperature, CTAB plays a major role and can transport the primitives to form a rod, but also forms an ordered hydrophobic film on the crystal plane, which inhibits the growth of the rod-like structure on the (100) crystal plane and controls the extension on the (002) crystal plane. Its degradation rate is about 2.64 times that of pure g-C3N4 . This significantly improves the separation rate of photogenerated electrons and the photocatalytic degradation efficiency.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0925-9635	1879-0062		WOS:000787847500001

It has many advantages such as producing pure hydrogen at high photon-tochemical energy efficiency and simple technical operation, but it suffers from the high cost of the catalyst. Here we show single-cell tests using commercial membranes and an in-house synthesized WO3-supported IrxRu1-xO2 anode catalyst. The catalyst was synthesized by Adam's Fusion protocol and loaded onto the support using an annealing procedure. Membrane electrode assemblies (MEAs) were prepared using an airbrush spraying technique. The electrolysis activity was greatly increased by adding tungsten carbide (WC) to the support, leading to a higher current density than commercial MEAs; however it also showed very fast degradation, losing most of the activity in minutes. The biggest issue in terms of stability seems to be on the cathode side of the cell.									11	1	0	0	0	0	11			2194-4288	2194-4296		WOS:000370257300022

This cell consists of a gradient-doped tungsten-bismuth vanadate (W:BiVO4) photoanode and a thin-film silicon solar cell. The improvement with respect to an earlier cell that also used gradient-doped W:BiVO4 has been achieved by simultaneously introducing a textured substrate to enhance light trapping in the BiVO4 photoanode and further optimization of the W gradient doping profile in the photoanode. Various PV cells have been studied in combination with this BiVO4 photoanode, such as an amorphous silicon (a-Si:H) single junction, an a-Si:H/a-Si:H double junction, and an a-Si:H/nanocrystalline silicon (nc-Si:H) micromorph junction. The highest conversion efficiency, which is also the record efficiency for metal oxide based water-splitting devices, is reached for a tandem system consisting of the optimized W:BiVO4 photoanode and the micromorph (a-Si:H/nc-Si:H) cell. This record efficiency is attributed to the increased performance of the BiVO4 photoanode, which is the limiting factor in this hybrid PEC/PV device, as well as better spectral matching between BiVO4 and the nc-Si:H cell.									119	3	0	0	16	1	119			1864-5631	1864-564X		WOS:000342815400011	25138735	
J	McLelland, James M.; Selleck, Bruce W.								Megacrystic Gore Mountain-type garnets in the Adirondack Highlands: Age, origin, and tectonic implications								GEOSPHERE				7	5			1194	1208		10.1130/GES00683.1				OCT 2011	2011	Spectacular exposures of the world's largest megacrystic garnets (to 35 cm diameter) occur in a coarse-grained amphibolite at the Barton Garnet Mine in the Adirondack Highlands (Gore Mountain, New York State, USA). Over the years, numerous geologists have concluded that the large size of the garnets resulted from an influx of fluids during ca. 1050 Ma upper amphibolite facies metamorphism of a ca. 1155 Ma olivine metagabbro. The presence of fluids under such mid-crustal pressure-temperature conditions is anomalous and warrants explanation. Evidence indicates that the fluids were introduced along, and close to, a steep border fault that juxtaposes charnockite against the garnet ore at the southern margin of the mine. Granitic pegmatites and quartz veins are present in the border zone and locally intrude the garnet ore.Geochronology has played a critical role in resolving the genesis of the Gore Mountain garnets. Over the past 20 yr Sm-Nd and Lu-Hf techniques have been used to date the crystallization of the garnets as 1049 +/- 5 Ma, an age that coincides with the termination of the contractional phase of the Ottawan orogeny, the onset of extensional orogen collapse, and the emplacement of the Lyon Mountain Granite. New U-Pb zircon age determinations of 1045 +/- 7.5 (Barton Garnet Mine) and 1055 +/- 7.4 (New York State Route 3 near Cranberry Lake) for Lyon Mountain granite pegmatites directly associated with megacrystic garnet amphibolites corroborate the synchronicity of emplacement of Lyon Mountain magmas and the growth of the garnet megacrysts.It is argued that during the ca. 1050 Ma extensional collapse of the Ottawan orogen, fluids gained access to extensional fault networks and interacted with country rocks. We further suggest that increasing temperature due to advected heat from Lyon Mountain Granite carried the Gore Mountain megagarnet amphibolite into granulite facies conditions that resulted in reactions between hornblende and garnet that produced ortho pyroxene and calcic plagioclase inter-growths, both as symplectites and coarsely textured pods developed in pressure shadows. Geothermal modeling of garnet zoning in metapelites (Storm and Spear, 2005) and oxygen isotope zoning in titanite (Bonamici et al., 2011) require a short period of rapid cooling ca. 1050 Ma, which we interpret to be related to the extensional collapse of the Ottawan orogen at that time (Rivers, 2008; McLelland et al., 2010a, 2010b). Reconnaissance of the southern and central Adirondacks reveals that a number of megacrystic garnet occurrences similar to those at Gore Mountain are present in areas that contain both metagabbros and megacrystic garnet amphibolites, and we propose that all of these formed during orogen collapse, intrusion of Lyon Mountain Granite, and fluid-related alteration at high temperature.									19	0	0	0	0	0	18			1553-040X			WOS:000297066800008

The physical and photophysical properties of the photocatalyst were characterized by SEM, TEM, XPS, UV-vis absorption, and photoluminescence, respectively. The core-ring NiCo2O4 nanoplatelets were composed of much smaller nanocrystallines, with air average size of 80-150 nm, compared to the ordinary NiCo2O4 prepared through a conventional hydroxide decomposition method. Moreover, the optical band gap energies of the core-ring NiCo2O4 nanoplatelets were estimated to be 2.06 and 3.63 eV from the UV-vis absorption spectra. The core-ring structured NiCo2O4 photocatalyst exhibited a much higher photocatalytic activity for the degradation of methylene blue than the ordinary NiCo2O4 and TiO2 under visible light irradiation (>420 nm). This enhanced photocatalytic activity of the core-ring NiCo2O4 nanoplatelets was attributed to their higher optical absorption ability, smaller particle size, and more active internal electron transitions. On the basis of all the results, the band structure of the photocatalyst was discussed.									237	14	0	0	13	0	244			1932-7447	1932-7455		WOS:000268661300004

Selenium concentrations in groundwaters from both aquifers are low (i.e., nanomolal concentrations) and vary both in magnitude and species [i.e., Se(VI), Se(IV), Se(-II)] distributions along the flow paths. Redox sensitive parameters (i.e., Fe(III), Fe(II), S(-II) dissolved oxygen, Eh) are consistent with oxic and suboxic conditions in and proximal to the recharge zones where Fe(III) reduction buffers the redox state, followed by anoxic/sulfidic conditions further down-gradient along the flow paths where sulfate reduction predominates. Evolving redox conditions, in conjunction with changes in groundwater pH along the flow paths exert important controls on the distribution of Se species in groundwaters from both aquifers. Within the Upper Floridan aquifer, for example, selenate [Se(VI)] and selenite (Se(IV)] predominate in oxic/suboxic groundwaters from near the recharge zone, whereas beyond 32 km, Se(IV) and organic selenide [i.e., Se(-II)] are the chief dissolved forms. The change in Se speciation near the recharge zone coincides with the apparent initiation of Fe(Ill) reduction. Further down-gradient along the flow path, where sulfate reduction buffers the redox conditions, Se(-II) becomes locally important. For the Carrizo Sand aquifer, Se(IV) dominates in groundwater from near the recharge zone, where Se(VI) exhibits variable concentrations and Se(-Il) is generally low and relatively constant. Redox conditions of groundwater from the recharge zone (i.e., 0 to similar to 8 km) vary between oxic and suboxic. However, with flow beyond similar to 8 km, the aquifer becomes confined and dissolved Fe(II) concentrations increase dramatically, suggesting the importance of Fe(III) reduction. In the zone of Fe(III) reduction, Se(IV) is the dominant dissolved Se species, and its coincident rise in concentration with the increasing Fe(II) concentrations suggests Se(IV) release to groundwaters via reductive dissolution of Fe(III) oxides/oxyhydroxides. With flow beyond 41 km, sulfate reduction predominates and pH exceeds 8. These observations suggest that pH induced desorption of Se(VI) from aquifer mineral surface sites may be important, however, mixing of groundwaters from multiple flow paths/line and/or compositional heterogeneity of aquifer sediments may also contribute. Overall, the data are consistent with reductive dissolution of Fe(III) oxides/oxyhydroxides, adsorption/desorption reactions, and mixing of multiple flow lines as exerting important controls on Se concentrations and speciation in groundwater flow systems.

However, current synthetic methods for translating 2D materials from the laboratory to industry cannot integrate both advantages of liquid-phase method (i.e., solution processibility, homogeneity, and massive production), and gas-phase method (i.e., high quality and large lateral size). Here, inspired by Chinese Sugar Figure Blowing Art, a rapid gel-blowing strategy is proposed for the mass production of 2D nonlayered nanosheets by thermally expanding the viscous gel precursors within a short time (approximate to 1 min). A wide variety of 2D nanosheets including oxides, carbon, oxides/carbon and metal/carbon composites are synthesized on a large scale and with no impurities. Importantly, this method unifies the merits of both liquid-phase and gas-phase syntheses, giving rise to 2D products with high uniformity, nanometer thickness, and large lateral sizes (up to hundreds of micrometers) simultaneously. The success of this strategy highly relies on the speed of blowing and control of the amount of reactants. The as-synthesized nanosheet electrodes manifest excellent electrochemical performance for alkali-ion batteries and electrocatalysis. This method opens up a new avenue for economical and massive preparation of good-quality nonlayered 2D nanosheets for energy-related applications and beyond.									73	10	0	0	3	0	73			0935-9648	1521-4095		WOS:000448786000020	30252169

Kuntze (Aizoaceae). A phylogenetic analysis revealed that TtASR was evolutionarily close to other two halophytic glycine-rich ASR members, SbASR-1 (from Salicornia brachiate) and SIASR (from Suaeda liaotungensis), with a typical abscisic acid (ABA)/water-deficit stress (WDS) domain at C-terminal. Quantitative RT-PCR analyses showed that TtASR was expressed in all tested different organs of the T. tetragonoides plant and that expression levels were apparently induced after salt, osmotic stress, and ABA treatments in T. tetragonoides seedlings. An induction of TtASR improved the growth performance of yeast and bacteria more than the control under high salinity, osmotic stress, and oxidative stress. TtASR was not a nuclear-specific protein in plant, and the transcriptional activation assay also demonstrated that TtASR could not activate reporter gene's expression in yeast. TtASR overexpressed Arabidopsis plants exhibited higher tolerance for salt/drought and oxidative stresses and lower ROS accumulation than wild type (WT) plants, accompanied by increased CAT, SOD activities, higher proline content, and lower MDA content in vivo. The results indicated that the TtASR was involved in plant responses to salt and drought, probably by mediating water homeostasis or by acting as ROS scavengers, and that it decreased the membrane damage and improved cellular osmotic adjustment that respond to abiotic stresses in microorganisms and plants.									3	1	0	0	2	0	4			0981-9428	1873-2690		WOS:000490633100021	31518852

Prompted by uncertainties in the composition at the base of the accreted envelope at the onset of convection, as well as the range of abundances detected in nova ejecta,we examine the effects of varying the composition of the accreted material. For carbon mass fractions < 2 x 10(-3) and the high accretion rates >= 10(-9) M-circle dot yr(-1) that we consider, we find that carbon, which is usually assumed to trigger the runaway via proton captures, is instead depleted and converted to N-14. Additionally, we quantify the importance of He-3, finding that convection is triggered by He-3+He-3 reactions for He-3 mass fractions > 2 x 10(-3). These different triggering mechanisms, which occur for critical abundances relevant to many nova systems, alter the amount of mass that is accreted prior to a nova, causing the nova rate to depend on the composition of the material accreted from the companion. Upcoming deep optical surveys such as Pan-STARRS-1, Pan-STARRS-4, and the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope may allow us to detect the dependence of nova rates on accreted composition. Furthermore, the burning and depletion of He-3 with a mass fraction of 10(-3), which is lower than necessary for triggering convection, still has an observable effect, resulting in a pre-outburst brightening in disk quiescence to > L-circle dot and an increase in effective temperature to 6.5 x 10(4) K for a 1.0 M-circle dot WD accreting at 10(-8) M-circle dot yr(-1).									29	0	0	0	0	0	29			0004-637X	1538-4357		WOS:000263553000030

It is thus reasonable to suggest that phenotypic plasticity plays important roles in the polyp's response to environmental change. We aimed at studying the influence of habitat-specific conditions on the sensitivity of A. aurita polyps to environmental cues acting as signals for polyp-to-jellyfish transformation, the so-called strobilation. We showed that the contribution of phenotypic plasticity to the polyp's response to environmental change was surprisingly high. When two laboratory cultures of Aurelia polyps originating from different geographic regions were reared under the same conditions for about a year, they demonstrated very similar shifts in their responses to environmental cues. Moreover, long-term changes in the rearing temperature affected the sensitivity of the polyps to a temperature drop which is well known as a natural inducer of strobilation.									2	0	1	0	2	0	2			0044-5134			WOS:000419260500002

The study is conducted by cyclic voltammetry, chronoamperometry, impedance spectroscopy and anodic Tafel polarization techniques. The results show that the apparent electrocatalytic activities of the modified oxide electrodes are much higher than those of unmodified electrodes under similar experimental conditions; the observed activity is the greatest with the modified La1.5Sr0.5NiO4 electrode. At 0.550V (vs. Hg vertical bar HgO) in 1 M KOH + 1 M CH3OH at 25 C, the latter electrode delivers a current density of over 200 mA cm(-2), whereas other electrodes of the series produce relatively low values (65-117 mA cm(-2)). To our knowledge, such high methanol oxidation current densities have not been reported on any other non-platinum electrode in alkaline solution. Further, the modified electrodes are not poisoned by methanol oxidation intermediates/products. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Photoelectrochemical devices use light-absorbers, such as semiconductors, to capture sunlight and generate excited states of charge carriers that are transported to catalysts for the production of renewable fuels. However, many photoactive materials are chemically unstable in contact with an aqueous electrolyte solution and therefore need protection through coating by a material that is chemically robust to prevent corrosion and conducting to allow transfer of charges to a solution-exposed catalytic site. Commonly used coating procedures and materials are often challenging to scale and therefore unlikely to be applicable on a scale to cover global energy demand. In this mini review, we present recent advances revolving around unconventional, yet technically simpler and less costly routes to protecting and activating photocorrodible electrodes for solar fuels application. We focus on two emerging approaches: (i) the use of single source precursor chemistry for the preparation of bifunctional protecting and catalytically active layers, and (ii) the use of low-temperature fusible eutectic alloys as protecting and conducting layers that can be easily activated for catalysis.									30	1	0	0	2	0	30			1754-5692	1754-5706		WOS:000401408500006

In this study, we successfully prepared CN materials with heterogeneous structures via hydrothermal treatment, high-temperature roasting, ball milling, sintering, and other processes. Benefitting from interface interactions in hybrid architectures, the CN photocatalysts exhibited high photocatalytic activity. The rate of hydrogen production using these CN photocatalysts reached 17028.82 mu mol h(-1) g(-)1, and the apparent quantum efficiency was 11.2% at 420 nm. The ns-level time-resolved photoluminescence (PL) spectra provided information about the time-averaged lifetime of fluorescence charge carriers; the lifetime of the charge carriers causing the fluorescence of CN reached 9.99 ns. Significantly, the CN photocatalysts displayed satisfactory results in overall water splitting without the addition of sacrificial agents. The average hydrogen and oxygen production rates were 270.95 mu mol h(-1) g(-1) and 115.21 mu mol h(-1) g(-1) in 7 h, respectively, which were promising results for the applications of the catalysts in overall water splitting processes. We investigated the high efficiency of the prepared CN photocatalysts via a series of tests (UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy, photocurrent response measurements, PL emission spectroscopy, time-resolved PL spectroscopy, and Brunauer-Emmett-Teller analysis). Furthermore, the Mott-Schottky plot and current-voltage curve were acquired via electrochemical tests. The fabricated CN photocatalyst had a small p-n junction in its heterogeneous structure, which further enhanced its photocatalytic efficiency. Therefore, this work can promote the development of CN photocatalysts. (C) 2021, Dalian Institute of Chemical Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences. Published by Elsevier B.V.

Light appears to play a critical role in the asexual-sexual switch-but fungal genomes harbour diverse light sensors. Fungal opsins are homologous to bacterial green-light-sensory rhodopsins, and their organismal functions in fungi have not been well understood. Three of these opsin-like proteins were widely distributed across fungal genomes, but homologs of the Fusarium opsin-like protein CarO were present only in plant-associated fungi. Key amino acids, including potential retinal binding sites, functionally diverged on the phylogeny of opsins. This diversification of opsin-like proteins could be correlated with life history-associated differences among fungi in their expression and function during morphological development. In Neurospora crassa and related species, knockout of the opsin NOP-1 led to a phenotype in the regulation of the asexual-sexual switch, modulating response to both light and oxygen conditions. Sexual development commenced early in Delta nop-1 strains cultured in unsealed plates under constant blue and white light. Furthermore, comparative transcriptomics showed that the expression of nop-1 is light-dependent and that the Delta nop-1 strain abundantly expresses genes involved in oxidative stress response, genes enriched in NAD/NADP binding sites, genes with functions in proton transmembrane movement and catalase activity, and genes involved in the homeostasis of protons. Based on these observations, we contend that light and oxidative stress regulate the switch via light-responsive and ROS pathways in model fungus N.crassa and other fungi.									27	2	0	0	26	0	29			0962-1083	1365-294X		WOS:000424111400015	29134709

The as-prepared CoSe2/CoSeO3 crystals were utilized as the electrocatalysts in dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs). Among all the crystals, the one obtained through Triton (R) X-100 enables its DSSC to achieve the best power conversion efficiency (eta) of 9.27%, which is even better than that of the DSSC with platinum (Pt) (7.91%). The catalytic abilities of the counter electrodes were analyzed by cyclic voltammetry (CV), Tafel polarization plots, and electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS). The photovoltaic behaviors are substantiated by incident photon-to-electron conversion efficiency (IPCE) spectra. The DSSC with CoSe2/CoSeO3-NP exhibited an h of 9.27% at 100 mW cm(-2), a better eta of 9.31% at 50 mW cm(-2), and the best h of 9.41% at 10 mW cm(-2), thereby extending the scope of application of this DSSC from outdoor to indoor regions. The earth abundant, low-cost material of CoSe2/CoSeO3-NP can be a promising electrocatalytic material to replace the expensive Pt in a DSSC. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Here, through theoretical calculation and experimental proof, it's found that the deposition of oxide films on both Al cathode and Ti anode current collectors exhibits strong passivation effect. When the thickness of Al2O3 film on Al is about 3 nm and the thickness of TiO2 film on Ti is about 5 nm, the electrochemical stability window of aqueous electrolyte can be expanded to 3.5 V. Therefore, TiS2 with low working potential (1.5 V versus Na+/Na) can be used as anode material in aqueous sodium-ion battery for the first time. We assembled a full cell coupling TiS2 anode with Prussian blue cathode in 15 M NaClO4 aqueous electrolyte. The full cell of 2.6 V demonstrates cycle life up to 1000 times with high energy density (100 Wh kg(-1)) and high rate capability (30 C). (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Graphene is intensively investigated owing to its unique electronic structure and device fabrication. Through the structural tunability of graphitic materials by chemical or physical modification of the surface, graphene is revealed to be an ideal material for proton manipulation. Here, we review the use of graphene or graphitic materials toward the manipulation of proton with regard to the following three points. (1) Electronic properties of graphene: The electronic band structure of graphene can be modified by metal contacts owing to the interaction with a metal surface. (2) Molecular control of graphitic interface: The chemical structure of graphene can be modified, as is done in molecular chemistry, and can be used as a catalytic platform. (3) Proton conduction by graphene: Proton transport through a graphene layer occurs with a unique mechanism such as tunneling. We provide a perspective on the use of graphitic materials toward controlling the behavior of protons on the basis of the aforementioned points. From the above, graphene can be used as a platform for proton manipulation.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			2451-9103			WOS:000495872600023

In this hybrid structure, 1D Ag@AgVO3 nanowire spenetrate through 2D nanosheets (graphene and PCN), forming a 3D hybrid photocatalyst, which is applied as an efficient visible light driven photocatalyst for organic pollutant degradation. Its enhanced photocatalytic activity is ascribed to the well-known electronic conductivity of 2D graphene, the intense visible light absorption of 1D Ag@AgVO3 nanowires, large surface areas and rapid photogenerated charge interface transfer and separation. Our results provide a facile way to fabricate hierarchical g-C3N4-based photocatalysts in a controlled manner and highlight promising prospects by adopting an integrative 1D and 2D nanomaterial strategy to design more efficient semiconductor-based composite photocatalysts with high photocatalytic activities and a wide spectral response toward environmental and energy applications.									209	9	0	0	21	0	211			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000353927500097

Experimental results								JOURNAL OF THE ELECTROCHEMICAL SOCIETY				155	5			F61	F65		10.1149/1.2844805				2008	2008	The present work deals with the microstructure and electrochemical characteristics of sputtered metallic iridium thin films. The thin films are characterized regarding their electrochemical performance in cyclic voltammetry. Distinct morphologies and microstructures of Ir thin films are generated by altering the process parameters of power, pressure, and target-to-substrate distance. Growth of films with high specific surface and high electroactivity can be fostered by process conditions that deliver a low surface mobility of the deposited atoms. The anodically delivered charge can be varied by factors of more than 30, merely determined by film morphology. Electrochemical characteristics of the thin films are strongly tied to crystallographic orientation. The development of preferred {111} orientation over adatom kinetic energy inversely correlates with the development of electrochemical activity. Enhanced shadowing effects during growth can be used to further increase the specific surface available for charge transfer. This is illustrated by changes in film thickness. Using a process supplying low-mobility Ir atoms to the surface, the thickest evaluated Ir film, at almost 3000 nm, delivers an anodic charge of 157 mC/cm(2) after 100-fold potential cycling.

Pinot noir) plants grown in calcareous soils. Changes in photosynthetic activities and PS It membrane polypeptides were investigated. When various photosynthetic electron transport activities were analyzed in isolated thylakoids, a major decrease in the rate of whole chain (H2O --> MV) electron transport was observed in chlorotic leaves, Such reduction was mainly due to the loss of PS II activity. Smaller inhibition of PS I activity was also observed in chlorotic leaves. The artificial electron donors, DPC and NH2OH markedly restored the loss of PS II activity in chlorotic leaves. The same results were obtained when variable fluorescence/maximum fluorescence (Fv/Fm) was evaluated by chlorophyll (Chl) fluorescence measurements. The marked loss of PS II activity in chlorotic leaves was evidently due to the loss of D1, 33, 28-25, and 23 kDa polypeptides. This conclusion was confirmed by immunological studies showing that the content of the D1 protein of the PS II reaction centre and of the 33 kDa protein of the water-splitting complex was diminished significantly in chlorotic leaves.

In this study, a novel 4-fold interpenetrated dia MOF was synthesized and characterized and then used as a N,S-containing precursor to fabricate a foam-like CoO@N,S-codoped carbon hybrid composite via thermal treatment. In the composites, the outermost foam-like N, S-codoped carbon matrix can effectively buffer the drastic volume variations, enhance electronic conductivity, and prevent CoO nanoparticles from aggregation and pulverization during discharge/charge processes. Consequently, the novel hybrid nanomaterial exhibited excellent electrochemical properties as an anode material for LIBs. The specific capacity can retain a stable value of about 809mA hg(-1) at a current of 1000 mA g(-1) within 500 cycles. As a proof-of-concept application, introduction of heteroatoms into MOFs can offer a valid method for doping the as-derived hybrid composites and then enhancing their performance as anodes of LIBs.									85	4	0	0	9	0	86			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000415070100010

ALD's epitaxial growth mechanism allowed the control of the morphology and thickness of the hematite films as well as the concentration and distribution of Ti atoms. The photoelectrochemical performances of Ti-doped and undoped hematite electrodes were examined and compared under water oxidation conditions. The incorporation of Ti atoms into hematite electrodes was found to dramatically enhance the water oxidation performance, with much greater enhancement found for the thinnest films. An optimum concentration similar to 3 atomic% of Ti atoms was also determined. A series of electrochemical, photoelectrochemical and impedance spectroscopy measurements were employed to elucidate the cause of the improved photoactivity of the Ti-doped hematite thin films. This performance enhancement was a combination of improved bulk properties (hole collection length) and surface properties (water oxidation efficiency). The improvement in both bulk and surface properties is attributed to the resurrection of a dead layer by the Ti dopant atoms.									182	12	0	0	5	0	188			1754-5692	1754-5706		WOS:000313892400026

We note that our measurements would not be able to detect neutrons at the level of Jones et al.(2) Three electrolytic cell experiments were conducted using palladium cathodes and Platinum anodes, in a 0.1-Molar solution of LiD in heavy water, without any signs of neutrons, tritium, or gammas above backgrounds, and within +/- 0.3 watt accuracy calorimetry, no excess heating. Excess heating at the levels of F&P would have been easily detected, if present. Intrinsic tritium, differing from each D2O bottle tested, was however observed. The longest duration experiment ran for 21 days, and was an attempt to duplicate the large "melting incident" of F&P. This was terminated on April 28, 1989, by throwing the vacuum-cast 22 gram, deuterium-loaded palladium cathode directly into liquid nitrogen, immediately next to a bare BF3 counter (backed by 25 cm of moderator), in order to attempt one of the Italian ENEA neutron production variants. No neutrons above backgrounds were seen, while counting for 1 hour, and also none while the piece warmed to room temperature over the next hour. Post-mortem analysis of the darkened, hardened Pd piece showed large crystal grains (up to 2 mm X 2 mm), and continuing evolution of gas bubbles at the grain boundaries even days after the experiment was ended. Eight weeks after loading, the catalytically-active palladium piece continued to create heavy water (with exposure to oxygen in the air).

Porous Substoichiometric TiO2 Anodes as Reactive Electrochemical Membranes for Water Treatment								ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY				47	12			6554	6563		10.1021/es401287e				JUN 18 2013	2013	This research investigates the characterization and testing of an anodic reactive electrochemical Membrane (REM) for water treatment. The REM consists of a porous substoichiometric titanium dioxide (Ti4O7) tubular, ceramic electrode operated in cross-flow filtration mode. Advection-enhanced mass transfer rates, on the order, of a 10-fold increase, are obtained when the REM is operated in filtration-mode, relative to a traditional flow-through mode. Oxidation experiments with model organic compounds showed that the REM was active for both direct oxidation reactions and formation of hydroxyl radicals (OH center dot). Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy data interpreted by transmission line modeling determined that the electro-active surface area was 619 times the nominal geometric surface area. Results from filtration-mode experiments with p-methoxyphenol indicate that compound removal occurred by electro-assisted adsorption and subsequent oxidation. Electro-assisted adsorption was the primary removal mechanism at potentials where OH center dot did not form. At higher potentials (>2.0 V), where OH center dot concentrations were significant, p-methoxyphenol removal occurred by a combination of electro-assisted adsorption and OH center dot oxidation. These removal mechanisms resulted in 99.9% p-methoxyphenol removal in the permeate, with calculated current efficiencies >73% at applied current densities of 0.5-1.0 mA cm(-2). These results illustrate the extreme promise of the REM for water treatment.									194	14	0	0	92	0	207			0013-936X	1520-5851		WOS:000320749000060	23688192

SECCM allows reactions to be confined to well defined nm-to-mu m-sized regions of a surface, and for experiments to be repeated quickly and easily at multiple locations. IRM is a highly surface-sensitive technique which reveals processes happening (very) close to a substrate with temporal and spatial resolution commensurate with typical electrochemical techniques. By using thin transparent conductive layers on glass as substrates, IRM can be coupled to SECCM, to allow real-time in situ optical monitoring of the SECCM meniscus and of processes that occur within it at the electrode/electrolyte interface. We first use the technique to assess the stability of the SECCM meniscus during voltammetry at an indium tin oxide (ITO) electrode at close to neutral pH, demonstrating that the meniscus contact area is rather stable over a large potential window and reproducible, varying by only ca. 5% over different SECCM approaches. At high cathodic potentials, subtle electrowetting is easily detected and quantified. We also look inside the meniscus to reveal surface changes at extreme cathodic potentials, assigned to the possible formation of indium nanoparticles. Finally, we examine the effect of meniscus size and driving potential on CaCO3 precipitation at the ITO electrode as a result of electrochemically-generated pH swings. We are able to track the number, spatial distribution and morphology of material with high spatiotemporal resolution and rationalise some of the observed deposition patterns with finite element method modelling of reactive-transport. Growth of solid phases on surfaces from solution is an important pathway to functional materials and SECCM-IRM provides a means for in situ or in operando visualisation and tracking of these processes with improved fidelity. We anticipate that this technique will be particularly powerful for the study of phase formation processes, especially as the high throughput nature of SECCM-IRM (where each spot is a separate experiment) will allow for the creation of large datasets, exploring a wide experimental parameter landscape.									12	0	0	0	2	0	11			1359-6640	1364-5498		WOS:000730370600001	34909815

However, their electrochemical properties strongly depend on the structural design of the doped heteroatoms, and a fundamental understanding of their electrocatalytic mechanism is still a challenge. Herein, a novel and effective sulfonated iron phthalocyanine pyrolysis strategy to synthesize Fe, N, and S tri-doped graphene nanohybrids is reported, and this hybrid is utilized as the catalyst support for highly efficient Pt nanodendrites. In this strategy, the incorporation of S atoms is rationally engineered by the sulfonate groups in the phthalocyanine molecules, and it leads to the uniform distribution of an active FeNx-S-2 configuration in the graphene structure, along with the Fe and N atoms. The Pt nanodendrites assembled on Fe, N, and S tri-doped graphene exhibit a much higher electrocatalytic activity and long-term electrochemical durability for methanol oxidation. Both controlled experiments and density functional theory calculations reveal that the co-doping of Fe, N, and S atoms is beneficial for the formation of dendritic Pt nanoparticles and the electrochemical performance enhancement of Pt nanodendrites. The density functional theory calculations indicate that the co-doping of Fe, N, and S atoms not only increases the ability to adsorb Pt and the catalyst durability, but also enhances the CO tolerance ability and prevents the poisoning effect during methanol oxidation. This study demonstrates a new method for the controllable synthesis of multi-doped graphene-based electrocatalysts with optimized surface structures and electrochemical performances.

Although it is accepted by many workers that the Archean atmosphere and ocean were anoxic, hematite in the 3.46 billion-year-old (Ga) Marble Bar Chert (MBC) from Pilbara Craton, NW Australia has figured prominently in arguments that the Paleoarchean atmosphere and ocean was fully oxygenated. In this study, we report the Fe isotope compositions and U concentrations of the MBC, and show that the samples have extreme heavy Fe isotope enrichment, where delta Fe-56 values range between +1.5 parts per thousand and +2.6 parts per thousand, the highest delta Fe-56 values for bulk samples yet reported. The high delta Fe-56 values of the MBC require very low levels of oxidation and, in addition, point to a Paleoarchean ocean that had high aqueous Fe(II) contents. A dispersion/reaction model indicates that O-2 contents in the photic zone of the ocean were less than 10(-3) mu M, which suggests that the ocean was essentially anoxic. An independent test of anoxic conditions is provided by U-Th-Pb isotope systematics, which show that U contents in the Paleoarchean ocean were likely below 0.02 ppb, two orders-of-magnitude lower than the modern ocean. Collectively, the Fe and U data indicate a reduced, Fe(II)-rich, U-poor environment in the Archean oceans at 3.46 billion years ago. Given the evidence for photosynthetic communities provided by broadly coeval stromatolites, these results suggests that an important photosynthetic pathway in the Paleoarchean oceans may have been anoxygenic photosynthetic Fe(II) oxidation.

This study was done to get an insight into the mechanism by which plants dissipate excess photon energy during high temperature. For this, measurement of photosystem II (PS II) and photosystem II (PS I) mediated electron transfer rates, P700 redox state and their recovery capacity was done. The results revealed that capacity of open PS II reaction centers to capture excitation energy, the dissipation of excitation energy in the form of heat or non-photochemical quenching [Y(NPQ)] and the quantum yield of PS II [Y(II)] were sensitive to the initial heat treatment (HT) time (2, 5 and 10 min) at 40 degrees C. PS I was stable at 40 degrees C till 5 min, but lost stability with increasing HT time. Under increasing HT time low value of Y(NA) indicated suppression of the over reduction of PS I acceptor side caused by increased quantum yield of cyclic electron flow [Y(CEF)] around PS I. The recovery studies in dark and light conditions showed that at 40 degrees C till 5 min, PS II was recovered completely. In 10 min, slight recovery was observed in PS II in dark while it recovered completely in light condition. This recovery in PS II was due to the recovery in the mentioned sensitive parameters. PS I was recovered completely in 10 min in dark and light conditions both. In 20 min slight recovery was seen in PS II and PS I both. It is concluded that PS II was recovered mainly at the donor side. It is also concluded that cyclic electron flow plays an important role in protection for PS I from heat stress through alleviating the over-reduction of PS I acceptor side.									5	0	0	0	3	0	5			0971-7811	0974-1275		WOS:000605885900001

Introduction of CoTBrPP onto the MR template not only leads to a larger specific area of 604 m(2) g(-1) in CoTBrPP@bio-C relative to that of CoTPP@bio-C (CoTPP = Br-free CoTBrPP), 98 m(2) g(-1), but more importantly also regulates the oriented distribution of pores precisely which promotes effective exposure of multiple active sites depending on the departure of Br-species attached to the Co-N-4 macrocycle periphery. Impressively, CoTBrPP@bio-C with a Co loading down to 0.77 at% exhibits higher all-pH ORR and HER performance compared to CoTPP@bio-C with a Co loading of 3.5 at%. An efficient TMAAE makes CoTBrPP@bio-C possess higher onset and half-wave potentials of 0.93 and 0.85 V for the ORR, and a smaller Tafel slope of 80 mV dec(-1) for the HER in an alkaline medium. CoTBrPP@bio-C also had a superior all-pH long-term stability and outstanding methanol tolerance, surpassing commercial Pt/C and most non-precious-metal catalysts reported to date. Furthermore, Zn-air batteries assembled with CoTBrPP@bio-C exhibited a higher peak power density of 100 mW cm(-2) and excellent durability than Pt/C.									27	1	0	0	3	0	27			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000501811800037

Golden2-like (GLK) transcription factors are involved in chloroplast development, directly targeting photosynthesis-associated nuclear genes for up-regulation. Although overexpression of GLKs leads to chloroplast development in non-photosynthetic organs, the mechanisms of coordination between the nuclear gene expression influenced by GLKs and the photosynthetic processes inside chloroplasts are largely unknown. To elucidate the impact of GLK-induced expression of photosynthesis-associated nuclear genes on the construction of photosynthetic systems, chloroplast morphology and photosynthetic characteristics in greenish roots of Arabidopsis thaliana lines overexpressing GLKs were compared with those in wild-type roots and leaves. Overexpression of GLKs caused up-regulation of not only their direct targets but also non-target nuclear and plastid genes, leading to global induction of chloroplast biogenesis in the root. Large antennae relative to reaction centers were observed in wild-type roots and were further enhanced by GLK overexpression due to the increased expression of target genes associated with peripheral light-harvesting antennae. Photochemical efficiency was lower in the root chloroplasts than in leaf chloroplasts, suggesting that the imbalance in the photosynthetic machinery decreases the efficiency of light utilization in root chloroplasts. Despite the low photochemical efficiency, root photosynthesis contributed to carbon assimilation in Arabidopsis. Moreover, GLK overexpression increased CO2 fixation and promoted phototrophic performance of the root, showing the potential of root photosynthesis to improve effective carbon utilization in plants.									59	3	0	0	51	0	61			0032-0781	1471-9053		WOS:000322668400013	23749810

Two kinds of Ni and BaTiO3 powders were used with different particle sizes. Volume shrinkage over the range of 700-1300 degrees C at 150 degrees C intervals and linear shrinkage during sintering were measured for starting materials and composites in a reducing atmosphere. The interfaces of Ni/BaTiO3 composites with 90: 10 and 70:30 volume ratios, respectively, were investigated using TEM. Composites with bimodal Ni powder show less shrinkage than those with monomodal Ni powder, showing less shrinkage in monolith Ni of bimodal particle size. The shrinkage behavior is changed during sintering with increasing amounts of BaTiO3 additives in both Ni-based composites. The particle size of the BaTiO3 additive affects the shrinkage behavior of composites, without the additional amount affecting the final shrinkage. A reaction layer of about 300 nm wide is observed at the interface between the Ni and BaTiO3 powders in composites, in which elemental Ni diffuses into the BaTiO3 without counterdiffusion.

Herein, the hybrid catalyst CdS/Ag2S/NiS is synthesized via hydrothermal and photodeposition methods. CdS/Ag2S/NiS shows a drastically elevated hydrogen production rate of 48.3 mmol g(-1) h(-1) under visible light due to the combined merits of the Schottky junction between CdS and metal-like Ag2S and the constructed p-n junction between CdS and NiS. Time-resolved photoluminescence spectroscopy and photochemical tests reveal the accelerated charge transfer and significantly reduced electron-hole pair recombination. Further investigation with in-situ surface photovoltage imaging technology demonstrates that the reduction cocatalyst Ag2S and oxidation cocatalyst NiS can serve as photogenerated electron and hole traps, respectively. This research not only provides insight into designing high-efficiency photocatalyst for hydrogen production but also utilize a brand new method for the confirmation of charge-carrier migration pathways.									83	7	0	0	8	0	85			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000632996200004

The obtained materials were characterized by means of techniques, such as field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), UV-visible diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS), and N-2 adsorption-desorption (BET). Photocatalytic activities of the TiO2/MMO nanocomposite was evaluated for O-2 generation from aqueous solutions in the presence of AgNO3 (1 mmol) as the sacrificial agent at neutral pH and room temperature under visible-light irradiation. It is found that photocatalytic activity of the TiO2/MMO sample was better than that of the TiO2/ZnAl-LDH sample, which could be attributed to the reduction in bandgap energy, low electron-hole recombination, and high surface area. An O-2 generation rate of 371 pmol/(g h) was achieved over 20 mg of the TiO2/MMO nanocomposite photocatalyst, and the quantum efficiency for O-2 generation was 84% at 400 nm. Such a quantum efficiency was the highest value obtained over the TiO2/MMO sample under visible-light illumination. This study presents a novel approach for water oxidation using the visible-light-responsive TiO2/MMO nanocomposite photocatalyst, which might be applied as a promising candidate in solar energy conversion and environmental science for highly efficient O-2 generation.

(1995) FEBS Lett. 360, 251-254]. Here we report that the photosystem II 33 kDa extrinsic protein is fully removed by HgCl2 added at micromolar and higher concentrations (0.25, 20, and 50 mu M), with the 17 and 23 kDa extrinsic proteins and other intrinsic proteins remaining bound to the reaction center. The data presented here put in doubt the "regulatory cap" model of PS II, which follows the OEC-33 kDa-23 kDa-17 kDa binding order, as these results directly demonstrate that the 33 kDa protein can be removed without affecting the binding of the 23 and 17 kDa proteins to the intrinsic subunits of PS II. This suggests that each extrinsic protein may possess its own binding site on PS II. A possible mechanism for HgCl2 upon the release of the 33 kDa protein is discussed.									8	0	0	0	7	0	8			0006-2960			WOS:000236015100030	16519535

From XRD analysis, the observed peaks corresponding to the plane match well with the JCPDS data of tetragonal ZrO2. Microstructural analysis shows that the average crystallite size decreases from 6.96 to 5.73 nm when the Cu content increases from 0 to 0.05 wt%. From FTIR analysis the peaks observed at 489 and 429 cm(-1)confirm the tetragonal Zirconia. From the morphology, the shape of the synthesized nanoparticles is observed to be spherical and the average particle size (using ImageJ) is found to vary from 30 to 7.18 nm when the dopant concentration increases from 0 to 0.05 wt%. The presence of Zr, Cu, and O in the prepared samples are confirmed by EDS analysis. The optical analysis shows that the optical absorption is blue-shifted when Cu content increases from 0 to 0.05 wt% and it is attributed to the confinement of charge carriers. Bandgap (Eg) analysis shows the transitions are direct allowed and the Eg value increases from 3. 27 to 3. 35 eV when Cu content increases from 0 to 0.05 wt%. From PL analysis, the peak at 389 nm is attributed to the ionized oxygen vacancies (F and F centers) from CB. From the photocatalytic analysis, undoped and Cu-doped ZrO(2)used as the catalyst for the degradation of Alizarin Yellow is found to be faster for 0.05 wt% of Cu-doped ZrO2(S3) than undoped (S1) and 0.03 wt% of Cu-ZrO2(S2) which is attributed to the crystallite size of the 0.05 wt% of Cu-doped ZrO(2)nanoparticles.									13	0	0	0	1	0	13			1574-1443	1574-1451		WOS:000560528800004

We have systematically investigated SiN, SiP, and SiAs homo-bilayers that are efficient for water splitting applications, and studied five different possible stacking configurations for these homo-bilayers. Our phonon dispersion curve analysis indicates the dynamical stability of odd stackings for all the studied bilayers. The electronic band structures of these stable stackings of SiX homo-bilayers were studied using GGA-PBE and hybrid HSE06 functional. All the studied systems are semiconductors with electronic bandgaps in the range of 2.488-0.948 eV with the hybrid HSE06 functional. Ultrahigh carrier mobilities of the order of 10(6) cm(2) V-1 s(-1) have been predicted. SiBi (S-I) indicated the highest carrier mobility of 18.1 x 10(6) cm(2) V-1 s(-1) for electrons along the x-direction. Most impressively, we found that the band edge potentials of SiP and SiAs straddle the oxidation and reduction potentials in photocatalytic water splitting. It was observed that only SiN satisfied the oxidation conditions, whereas SiSb and SiBi satisfied the reduction conditions in water splitting. An excellent optical absorption was obtained for SiN, SiP, and SiAs homo-bilayers in the visible region, indicating their potential in photocatalytic water splitting. Further, the electrocatalytic activity towards OER/ORR was investigated using first-principles calculations. The thermoelectric figure of merit was explored, and the highest value of 1.02 was obtained for the SiSb monolayer. Our results indicate that Si-based homo-bilayers display promising potential for visible-light-driven photocatalytic water splitting and thermoelectric applications.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			2044-4753	2044-4761		WOS:000667344200001

Here, we demonstrate that multifunctional, nanoscale catalysts that enable high-performance photoelectrochemical energy conversion can be engineered by plasma-enhanced atomic layer deposition. The collective properties of tailored Co3O4/ Co(OH)(2) thin films simultaneously provide high activity for water splitting, permit effcient interfacial charge transport from semiconductor substrates, and enhance durability of chemically sensitive interfaces. These films comprise compact and continuous nanocrystalline Co3O4 spinel that is impervious to phase transformation and impermeable to ions, thereby providing effective protection of the underlying substrate. Moreover, a secondary phase of structurally disordered and chemically labile Co(OH)(2) is introduced to ensure a high concentration of catalytically active sites. Application of this coating to photovoltaic p(+) n-Si junctions yields best reported performance characteristics for crystalline Si photoanodes.									179	4	0	0	10	0	180			1476-1122	1476-4660		WOS:000394601600016	27820814

The partitioned substrates provided an internal reference, namely, Pt on Au versus Pt on Ni, for every growth experiment. Deposition at large overpotentials yielded a Pt overlayer approximately 1 ML thick on Au or 2 to 3 ML thick on Ni as determined by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). Ion scattering spectroscopy (ISS) indicated that Pt covered 60% of the Ni surface forming a Pt50Ni50 surface alloy stabilized by excess Pt-Ni bond enthalpy supplemented by O- and H-induced Ni segregation. The Pt deposition rate on Ni was constrained by Ni oxide reduction while self-termination was mediated by the formation of a layer of adsorbed hydrogen (H-upd) on the Pt-Ni surface. Multi-cycle Pt deposition on Ni involved emersion and rapid water rinsing in air to oxidize the Hupd followed byre-immersion for additional Pt deposition. Four deposition cycles resulted in a Pt-terminated surface. The electrocatalytic activity for hydrogen production in alkaline media was significantly enhanced on the Pt-Ni monolayer film relative to Pt. The Pt-Ni electrode deactivated with time although intermittent oxidation at, or above, 1 V-RHE restructured the electrode to form an active Pt-Ni(OH)(2) composite surface.

Here we review four approaches for quantifying or monitoring PS II functionality or the stoichiometry of the two photosystems in leaf segments, scrutinizing the approximations in each approach. (1) Chlorophyll fluorescence parameters are convenient to derive, but the information-rich signal suffers from the localized nature of its detection in leaf tissue. (2) The gross O-2 yield per single-turnover flash in CO2-enriched air is a more direct measurement of the functional content, assuming that each functional PS II evolves one O-2 molecule after four flashes. However, the gross O-2 yield per single-turnover flash (multiplied by four) could over-estimate the content of functional PS II if mitochondrial respiration is lower in flash illumination than in darkness. (3) The cumulative delivery of electrons from PS II to P700(+) (oxidized primary donor in PS I) after a flash is added to steady background far-red light is a whole-tissue measurement, such that a single linear correlation with functional PS II applies to leaves of all plant species investigated so far. However, the magnitude obtained in a simple analysis (with the signal normalized to the maximum photo-oxidizable P700 signal), which should equal the ratio of PS II to PS I centers, was too small to match the independently-obtained photosystem stoichiometry. Further, an under-estimation of functional PS II content could occur if some electrons were intercepted before reaching PS I. (4) The electrochromic signal from leaf segments appears to reliably quantify the photosystem stoichiometry, either by progressively photoinactivating PS II or suppressing PS I via photo-oxidation of a known fraction of the P700 with steady far-red light. Together, these approaches have the potential for quantitatively probing PS II in vivo in leaf segments, with prospects for application of the latter two approaches in the field.									23	2	1	0	22	0	26			0166-8595	1573-5079		WOS:000308188800005	22638914

In order to better understand the influence of malting process on beer staling, it is necessary to acquire a reliable analytical methodology for determination of beer staling aldehydes in malt. Therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate extraction parameters, which allow quantification of beer staling aldehydes present in pale malts. The method was validated with respect to linearity (R > 0.9988), limit of detection (0.28 - 0.99 mu g/L), limit of quantification (0.92 - 3.31 mu g/L), accuracy (+/- 5%), repeatability (1.3 - 5.3%) and intermediate precision (>20%). The following parameters of sample preparation were evaluated: sample amount, extraction time and temperature, ultrasonication time and oxygen level. Consequently, the best extraction conditions were successfully applied on pale malts. After extraction, the samples were analysed by headspace solid-phase microextraction (HS-SPME) with on fibre carbonyl derivatisation followed by gas chromatography and mass spectrometry (GC-MS). In addition, the salting-out effect during HS-SPME was studied. The method application allowed to identify significant differences (p <= 0.05) in the levels of aldehydes among various industrial scale, pale malts. The optimised method could give the information on the aldehyde content introduced into the brewing process and its potential contribution to the overall beer quality. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

The FRR fluorescence technique applies a sequence of subsaturating excitation pulses ('flashlets') at microsecond intervals to induce fluorescence transients. This approach is extremely flexible and allows the generation of both single-turnover (ST) and multiple-turnover (MT) flashes. Using a combination of ST and MT flashes, we investigated the effect of excitation protocols on the measured fluorescence parameters. The maximum fluorescence yield induced by an ST flash applied shortly (10 Cls to 5 ms) following an MT flash increased to a level comparable to that of an MT flash, while the functional absorption cross-section decreased by about 40%. We interpret this phenomenon as evidence that an MT flash induces an increase in the fluorescence-rate constant, concomitant with a decrease in the photosynthetic-rate constant in PS II reaction centers. The simultaneous measurements of sigma(PS) (II), p, and the kinetics of Q(A)(-) reoxidation, which can be derived only from a combination of ST and MT flash fluorescence transients, permits robust characterization of the processes of photosynthetic energy-conversion.

To remove the excess of ROS, plants use different antioxidants and tune their activity and/or isoform number as required for given light conditions. In this study, the adaptiveness of light-induced variation in the activities and isoform patterns of key enzymatic antioxidants SOD, APX and CAT was tested in leaves of Iris pumila clonal plants from two natural populations inhabiting a sun exposed dune site and a forest understory, using a reciprocal-transplant experiment. At the exposed habitat, the mean enzymatic activity of total SODs was significantly greater than that in the shaded one, while the amount of the mitochondrial MnSOD was notably higher compared to the plastidic Cu/ZnSOD. However, the number of Cu/ZnSOD isoforms was greater in the forest understory relative to the exposed site (three vs. two, respectively). An inverse relationship recorded between the quantities of MnSOD and Cu/ZnSOD in alternative light habitats might indicate that the two enzymes compensate each other in maintaining intracellular ROS and redox balance. The adaptive population differentiation in APX activity was exclusively recorded in the open habitat, which indicated that the synergistic effect of high light and temperature stress could be the principal selective factor, rather than high light alone. The enzymatic activity of CAT was similar between the two populations, implicating APX as the primary H2O2 scavenger in the I. pumila leaves exposed to high light intensity.

The few-layered MoS2 (4-10 nm) nanoflakes electrode grown in water exhibits unprecedented higher photocurrents under visible light irradiation, and the stability of the few-layered MoS2 electrode was markedly enhanced by annealing the sample at 300 degrees C. The underlying mechanisms accounting for the superior photoelectrochemical performance of the few-layered MoS2 nanoflakes are found to be correlated with their phase, crystallinity, length, number of layers and photon absorption efficiency etc. Furthermore, the photoelectrochemical degradation of organic chemicals including rhodamine B dye, 4-chlorophenol, chlorpyrifos and ciprofloxacin selected as different types of pollutants in wastewater was evaluated and compared utilizing the few-layered MoS2 nanoflakes photoanode. The photoelectrochemical degradation efficiency is strongly influenced by the molecular structures and properties of pollutants and experimental condition parameters such as solution pH, oxygen concentration and applied bias potential. The available high electron cloud density sites induced by the electron-withdrawing functional groups in different substrates might determine the substrate-specific PEC degradation efficiency. The present MoS2-based PEC system could be further optimized for efficient degradation of recalcitrant pollutant like ciprofloxacin.									44	1	0	0	13	0	43			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000447004100100

Two types of coral bleaching had been thoroughly discussed in the scientific literature; the first is primarily associated with mass coral bleaching events; the second is a seasonal loss of algae and/or pigments. Here, we describe a phenomenon that has been witnessed for repeated summers in the mesophotic zone (40-63 m) in the northern Red Sea: seasonal bleaching and recovery of several hermatypic coral species. In this study, we followed the recurring bleaching process of the common coral Stylophora pistillata. Bleaching occurred from April to September with a 66% decline in chlorophyll a concentration, while recovery began in October. Using aquarium and transplantation experiments, we explored environmental factors such as temperature, photon flux density and heterotrophic food availability. Our experiments and observations did not yield one single factor, alone, responsible for the seasonal bleaching. The dinoflagellate symbionts (of the genus Symbiodinium) in shallow (5 m) Stylophora pistillata were found to have a net photosynthetic rate of 56.98-92.19 mu mol O-2 cm(-2) day(-1). However, those from mesophotic depth (60 m) during months when they are not bleached are net consumers of oxygen having a net photosynthetic rate between -12.86 -(-10.24) mu mol O-2 cm(-2) day(-1). But during months when these mesophotic corals are partially-bleached, they yielded higher net production, between -2.83-0.76 mu mol O-2 cm(-2) day(-1). This study opens research questions as to why mesophotic zooxanthellae are more successfully meeting the corals metabolic requirements when Chl a concentration decreases by over 60% during summer and early fall.									33	0	0	0	32	2	35			1932-6203			WOS:000330235100045	24454772

Er stoichiometric along with W nonstoichiometric codoping was introduced to simultaneously manage vacancy creation during substitutional doping, enhance light absorption, and reduce overall impedance. It was found that Er3+ is substituted at the Bi3+ sites in the BiVO4 lattice to provide expanded light absorption from 400 to 680 nm. The fabricated WO3/(Er,W):BiVO4 electrode shows photocurrent densities of 4.1 and 7.2 mA cm(-2) at 1.23 and 2.3 V (vs reversible hydrogen electrode, RHE), respectively, under a 1 sun illumination in K2HPO4 electrolyte. This electrode has shown remarkably high charge separation efficiency of 93% at 1.23 V (vs RHE). With the addition of a standard surface catalyst (i.e., Co-Pi), the WO3/(Er,W):BiVO4/Co-Pi electrode exhibits the highest photocurrent of 5.6 +/- 0.3 mA cm(-2) at 1.23 V (vs RHE), nearing the theoretical limit (i.e., 7.5 mA cm(-2)) while retaining 98% of the photoelectrochemical cell performance after 3 h. By concomitantly doping the Bi3+ and V5+ sites to enhance absorption, this study demonstrates for the first time a planar WO3/BiVO4 heterojunction that reaches 88% of the record-high performance of its nanostructured counterpart. Through a detailed characterization of the electrodes, it is concluded that the stoichiometric Er and nonstoichiometric W codoping extend light absorption region and improve charge separation efficiency by reducing bulk resistance. The photoactive materials with 2D morphology were synthesized using a facile ultrasonic spray-coating technique without any complex process steps and thus it can be scaled for commercial development.									39	0	0	0	0	0	39			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000470034700016	31062583

Mutation of arginine 357 of the CP43 protein of photosystem II severely impairs the catalytic S-state cycle of the H2O oxidation complex								BIOCHEMISTRY				46	43			11987	11997		10.1021/bi701387b				OCT 30 2007	2007	Basic amino acid side chains situated in active sites may mediate critical proton. transfers during an enzymatic catalytic cycle. In the case of photosynthetic water oxidation, a strong base is postulated to facilitate the deprotonation of the active site Mn4-Ca cluster, thereby allowing the otherwise thermodynamically constrained transfer of an electron away from the Mn4-Ca cluster to the oxidized redox active tyrosine radical, Yz circle, generated by photosynthetic charge separation. Arginine 357 of the CP43 polypeptide may be located in the second coordination shell of the O-2-evolving Mn-4-Ca cluster of photosystem II (PSII) according to current structural models. An ostensibly conservative substitution mutation, CP43-357K, was investigated using polarographic and fluorescence techniques in evaluating its potential impact on S-state cycling. Cells containing the CP43-357K mutation lost their capacity for autotrophic growth and exhibited a drastic reduction in 02 evolving activity (similar to 15% of that of the wild type) despite the fact that mutant cells contained more than 80% of the concentration of charge-separating PSII reaction centers and more than half of these contained photooxidizable Mn. Fluorescence kinetics indicated that acceptor side electron transfer, dominated by the transfer of electrons from QA(-) to Q(B), was unaffected, but the fraction of centers containing Mn clusters capable of forming the S-2 state was reduced to similar to 40% of that of the wild type. Analysis Of 02 Yields using a bare platinum electrode indicated a severe defect in the S-state cycling properties of the mutant H2O oxidation complexes. Although 02 evolution was delayed to the third flash during a train of single-turnover saturating flashes, the pattern Of 02 emission did not exhibit a discernible periodicity indicating a very high miss factor, which was estimated to be similar to 45% compared to the wild-type value of similar to 10%. On the other hand, the multiflash fluorescence measurements indicate that the yield of formation of the S2 state from S I is diminished by similar to 20%, although this latter estimate is complicated by the presence of damaged PSII centers. Taken together, the experiments indicate that the high miss factor observed during S-state cycling is likely due to a defect in the higher S-state transitions. These results are discussed in relation to the idea that CP43-R357 may serve as a ligand to bicarbonate or as the catalytic base proposed to mediate proton-coupled electron transfer (PCET) in the higher S states of the catalytic cycle of H2O oxidation.									51	0	1	0	36	0	52			0006-2960			WOS:000250379900001	17915952

This includes the ability to completely suspend embryo development for extended periods until normoxia is restored. However, only a limited number of studies have examined the gene regulatory responses of zebrafish embryos to hypoxia. The High Mobility Group A1 protein encoded by the mammalian gene HMGA1 is widely expressed during embryo development but not in adults. Its expression can be induced in adult neurons by hypoxia/oxidative stress and it is commonly reactivated in many types of cancer. We report the identification by phylogenetic and conserved synteny analyses of an HMGA1 orthologue in zebrafish, hmga1 (hmg-i/y) and analysis of sodium azide as a chemical agent for inducing hypoxia-like responses in zebrafish embryos including temporary suspension of development ("suspended animation"). Evidence was only found for the existence of the "a" isoform of HMGA1 in fish. The "b" and "c" isoforms were not detected. We show that zebrafish hmga1 is expressed in a manner similar to in mammals including its induction by hypoxia during hatching stage and in adult zebrafish brain. However, earlier during development, hypoxia causes a decrease in hmga1 transcript levels. By analysis of conservation of the HMGA1a isoform binding site in zebrafish psen2 gene transcripts, we predict that a zebrafish equivalent of the PS2V isoform of human PSEN2 is not formed and we support this by RT-PCR analyses. Thus, analysis of hmga1 function in zebrafish embryogenesis may be valuable for understanding its wider role in vertebrate development, cancer and cellular responses to hypoxia but not for analysis of the action of HMGA1 in PS2V formation.

In this study, we describe the isolation and functional characterization of a novel Mn-SOD from durum wheat (Triticum turgidum L. subsp. Durum), named TdMnSOD. Molecular phylogeny analysis showed that the durum TdMnSOD exhibited high amino acids sequence identity with other Mn-SOD plants. The three-dimensional structure showed that TdMnSOD forms a homotetramer and each subunit is composed of a predominantly a-helical N-terminal domain and a mixed alp C-terminal domain. TdMnSOD gene expression analysis showed that this gene was induced by various abiotic stresses in durum wheat. The expression of TdMnSOD enhances tolerance of the transformed yeast cells to salt, osmotic, cold and H2O2-induced oxidative stresses. Moreover, the analysis of TdMnSOD transgenic Arabidopsis plants subjected to different environmental stresses revealed low H2O2 and high proline levels as compared to the wild-type plants. Compared with the non-transformed plants, an increase in the total SOD and two other antioxidant enzyme activities including catalase (CAT) and peroxidases (POD) was observed in the three transgenic lines subjected to abiotic stress. Taken together, these data provide evidence for the involvement of durum wheat TdMnSOD in tolerance to multiple abiotic stresses in crop plants. (C) 2016 Elsevier GmbH.

J	Bariteau, A; Thiry, M								Analysis and simulation of the geochemical transfers within an aquifer: the Beauce ground-water and the alteration of the Fontainebleau Sands								BULLETIN DE LA SOCIETE GEOLOGIQUE DE FRANCE				172	3			367	381		10.2113/172.3.367				2001	2001	Aims. - Ground-water mineralisation results mainly from alteration of the confining aquifer along its flow path. Such alteration may deeply alter the aquifer formations and have to be recognized to avoid misinterpretation of the altered facies. The Beauce ground-water and the Fontainebleau Sands aquifer have been studied to highlight such ground-water/aquifer interactions.The Beauce ground-water is contained in thick limestone series (Oligo-Miocene) interlayered with the Fontainebleau Sands (Stampian). The sands show various facies related to the geomorphology : dark and reduced facies are restricted to the bottom of the Formation in the center of the plateaux, oxidized yellowish facies occur in the vadose zone beneath the plateaux, and bleached white facies at the edge of the plateaux. These Facies result from modern alterations due to the ground-water and the recharge waters. The water and rock chemistry allows to investigate the diverse stages of the geochemical and weathering processes that occur within the aquifer, and to calculate accurate mass balance of the dissolved and exported elements.Hydrochemistry of the Beauce ground-water. - Each compartment of the aquifer can be characterised by one type of water. (1) The aquifer is recharged by two types of water. The waters coming from the limestone plateau are calco-carbonaceous, oxygenated and lightly mineralised, especially in silica : those coming from the sandy soils near the outcropping sand area are more acidic, oxygenated and very lightly mineralised. (2) The ground-water of the limestone aquifer are oxygenated, oversaturated with respect to quartz and near equilibrium with calcite and cristobalite. Silica comes from the alteration of the clay minerals and/or the cherts in the limestones. The ground-waters are of calco-carbonaceous type, have pH values approx 6.5. They are characterised by a relative low mineralisation (average 460 mg.kg(-1)), an oversaturation with respect to quartz and the presence of dissolved oxygen (Eh around +450 mV). (3) The ground-water of the dark sands aquifer contains hydrogen sulfur and is oxygen free (Eh around +140 mV), with relatively high Fe and SO4 contents related to the pyrite oxidation. It is also characterised by a relatively high SiO2 and cations contents resulting from the alteration of the alumino-silicates. (4) The ground-water of the bleached sands aquifer is strongly diluted by the recharge waters from the sand-v soils. It remains oversaturated with respect to quartz and has the ability to hydrolyse the alumino-silicates.Geochemical modelling. - The ground-water/aquifer interactions have been modelled. The modelisation takes into account the kinetics of water/rock interactions and was done by successive steps. (1) Alteration of the dark sands by the ground-water leads to dissolution of the pyrite and the calcite. The pyrite oxidation and the << buffering >> calcite dissolution directly depend on oxygen availability in the ground-water. Muscovite remains stable. feldspars and glauconite are partially dissolved and Al-smectite forms. The composition of the resulting simulated oxydized sands agrees with the analyses. (2) The leaching of these oxydized sands by the calco-carbonaceous recharge water leads to simulate leached sands of similar composition than the unsaturated sands beneath the plateau. Muscovite remains stable: smectite, kaolinite and hematite form. (3)The final leaching of the former leached rand by the acidic recharge water brings about to simulate bleached sand. The muscovite stability, smectite dissolution and kaolinite precipitation are in conformity with the composition of the white sands.Nevertheless. the modelisation is not fully in agreement with the mass balance calculations. The discrepancy mainly comes from the simulation of excessive amounts of clay minerals and iron oxides. This precipitation excess may be related to the fact that the precipitation kinetics and/or of the organic complexations have not been taken into account in the model. Even if theie is discrepancy in the mass balance, the thermokinetic simulations validate the reaction path which leads to the Beauce ground-water mineralisation and the Fontainebleau Sands bleaching.Discussion. - Ground-water chemistry thus provides information on the alteration processes and indicates that the alte rations are presently active. The white facies results from the progressive alteration of dark primary sands. This bleaching leads to a complete change of the geochemical characteristics of the Fontainebleau Sands. These alterations come with the export of a large amount of material corresponding to a geochemical lowering of the Beauce Plateau of at least 10 m during the Plio-Quaternary period.This example illustrates the importance of the sub-surface alterations due to ground-water flow, that are difficult to gauge from outcrop observation only.									4	0	0	0	3	0	4			0037-9409	1777-5817		WOS:000169935300012

The expression profiles of Mdsirt1 in different developmental stages (egg, 1st instar larva, 2nd instar larva, 3rd instar larva, pupa and adult), various tissues of the 2nd instar larvae (cuticle, gut, fat body and hemocyte), and the 2nd instar larvae under stresses (challenged by bacteria, heat shock and CdCl2 stimulation) were investigated via quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR). RNAi was employed to knock down the expression of Mdsirt1 in M. domestica larvae by microinjection with dsRNA, and then the resistance of larvae to bacteria and oxidative stress was detected. 【Results】 The deduced protein encoded by Mdsirt1 contains a predicted SIR2 domain, and shows 66% sequence identity with SIR2 from Stomoxys calcitrans. qRT-PCR results showed that Mdsirt1 was mainly transcribed in the pupal stage and fat body of the 2nd instar larvae of M. domestica. Enhanced expression of Mdsirt1 was observed in response to Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus challenge for 3 and 6 h, respectively. The expression of Mdsirt1 was significantly induced by heat shock of 42℃ for 30 min, and cadmium stimulation (exposure to 30 mmol/L CdCl2) for 48 h. The survival rate observed in larvae treated with dsRNA of Mdsirt1 under bacterial challenge (E. coli∶S. aureus=1∶1) was 1.47-fold lower than that treated with dsRNA of GFP. RNAi-mediated knockdown of Mdsirt1 led to oxidative stress, and caused rapid increase of 1.58- and 1.59-fold in the reactive oxygen species (ROS) level and malondialdehyde (MDA) content, respectively. 【Conclusion】 Mdsirt1 is involved in immunity and stress resistance in M. domestica larvae.			【目的】探究家蝇Musca domestica sirt1基因(Mdsirt1)在各种胁迫条件下的表达模式。【方法】以家蝇2龄幼虫cDNA为模板,PCR扩增Mdsirt1基因序列并进行生物信息学分析;实时定量PCR(qRT-PCR)检测Mdsirt1在家蝇不同发育阶段(卵、1龄幼虫、2龄幼虫、3龄幼虫、蛹和成虫)的表达变化,2龄幼虫不同组织(表皮、肠道、脂肪体和血细胞)中的表达分布,以及胁迫条件(细菌刺激、热激及CdCl2刺激)下的转录水平变化;通过RNAi干扰Mdsirt1基因表达,观察敲低Mdsirt1表达后家蝇幼虫抗病能力变化,并检测机体氧化应激水平。【结果】家蝇Mdsirt1基因编码蛋白含有SIR2结构域,与厩螫蝇Stomoxys calcitrans SIR2氨基酸序列一致性为66%。qRT-PCR结果显示,Mdsirt1基因主要在家蝇蛹期表达,在家蝇2龄幼虫脂肪体中表达量较高。家蝇幼虫Mdsirt1分别在大肠杆菌Escherichia coli刺激3 h,金黄色葡萄球菌Staphylococcus aureus刺激6 h,42℃热激30 min以及30 mmol/L CdCl2刺激48 h时表达量达到最高峰。敲低Mdsirt1表达的家蝇幼虫受到细菌感染(大肠杆菌和金黄色葡萄球菌1∶1混合感染)后存活率较对照组显著降低1.47倍,且敲低Mdsirt1后机体处于氧化应激状态,活性氧自由基水平和丙二醛含量较对照组分别升高1.58和1.59倍。【结论】Mdsirt1参与家蝇幼虫的抗菌免疫应答和抗逆反应。						0	1	0	0	1	0	1			0454-6296			CSCD:6164982

The effects of process parameters, i.e. laser fluence and number of pulse (NOP), on nanostructure morphology of the A-ZnO microtube are investigated, by which the controllable hierarchic nanostructures are achieved. The mechanism of the nanostructure formation is attributed to self-assembled growth by decomposition and re-nucleation owing to rapid heating and cooling down during laser irradiation near Zn-vacancy-related point defects. The Raman and photoluminescence spectra confirm that the nanostructures possess massive surface defects, e.g. oxygen vacancies (V-o) and zinc interstitials (Zn-i). The electrical resistivity of the nanostructured A-ZnO microtube is down to similar to 10(-)(3) Omega cm, about one order of magnitude lower than that of the as-grown A-ZnO microtube. The great ratio of surface area to volume of the nanostructures realizes the improved UV detection and photodegradation performance. The optimal photoresponsivity can be up to 27.08 A/W using the process parameters of 200 mJ/cm(2) and 100 pulses. The catalytic degradation rate of the A-ZnO microtube irradiated by 150 mJ/cm(2) and 200 pulses with 6-nm Au nanoparticles decoration for methylene blue solution is similar to 3.4 times higher than the commercial nanoparticles. The present work paves a new way to design and fabricate a variety of hierarchic nanostructures on undoped A-ZnO microtube for enhanced electrical and photocatalytic performance.

Proton-coupled electron transport of the redox-active tyrosines and its relationship to water oxidation								BIOCHIMICA ET BIOPHYSICA ACTA-BIOENERGETICS				1503	1-2			147	163		10.1016/S0005-2728(00)00220-6				JAN 5 2001	2001	The combination of site-directed mutagenesis, isotopic labeling, new magnetic resonance techniques and optical spectroscopic methods have provided new insights into cofactor coordination and into the mechanism of electron transport and proton-coupled electron transport in photosystem II. Site-directed mutations in the D1 polypeptide of this photosystem have implicated a number of histidine and carboxylate residues in the coordination and assembly of the manganese cluster, responsible for photosynthetic water oxidation. Many of these are located in the carboxy-terminal region of this polypeptide close to the processing site involved in its maturation. This maturation is a required precondition for cluster assembly. Recent proposals for the mechanism of water oxidation have directly implicated redox-active tyrosine Y-Z in this mechanism and have emphasized the importance of the coupling of proton and electron transfer in the reduction of Y-Z(.) by the Mn cluster. The interaction of both homologous redox-active tyrosines Y-Z and Y-D with their respective homologous proton accepters is discussed in an effort to better understand the significance of such coupling.

Multigenerational cultures (F0, F1, F2) of Daphnia magna in collected stream water (OCSW), contaminated with high fecal coliform, altered the reproductive scenario (changes in first brood size timing, clutch numbers, clutch size etc.), compromised fitness (increase hemoglobin, alteration in behavior), and affected global DNA methylation (hypermethylation) without affecting survival. Using proteomics approach, we found 288 proteins in F0 and 139 proteins in F2 that were significantly differentially upregulated after OCSW exposure. The individual protein expressions, biological processes and molecular functions were mainly related to metabolic processes, development and reproduction, transport (protein/lipid/oxygen), antioxidant activity, increased globin and S-adenosylmethionine synthase protein level etc., which was further found to be connected to phenotype-dependent endpoints. The proteomics pathway analysis evoked proteasome, chaperone family proteins, neuronal disease pathways (such as, Parkinson's disease) and apoptosis signaling pathways in OCSW-F0, which might be the cause of behavioral and developmental alterations in OCSW-F0. Finally, chronic multigenerational exposure to OCSW exhibited slow physiological adaptation in most of the measured effects, including proteomics analysis, from the F0 to F2 generations. The common upregulated proteins in both generations (F0 & F2), such as, globin, vitellinogen, lipid transport proteins etc., were possibly play the pivotal role in the organism's physiological adaptation. Taken together, our results, obtained with a multilevel approach, provide new insight of the molecular mechanism in fecal coliform-induced phenotypic plasticity in Daphnia magna.

We cloned and characterised the TIMP1 gene from Apostichopus japonicus using RACE approaches (designated as AjTIMP1). For Vibrio splendidus-challenged sea cucumbers, the peak expression of AjTIMP1 mRNAs in coelomocytes was detected at 24 h (23.44-fold) and remained at high levels (4.01-fold) until 72 h. Similarly, AjTIMP1 expression was upregulated in primary coelomocytes exposed to 10 mu g mL-1 LPS. AjTIMP1 was expressed in all tissues, and the highest expression was observed in the body wall. Functional investigation revealed an imbalance in the ratio of AjMMP1/AjTIMP1 in the skin ulceration syndrome (SUS) diseased group; it was sharply up-regulated to 3.97:1 compared with the healthy group. Furthermore, when AjTIMP1 was knocked down using small interfering RNA (siRNA-KD) to 0.4fold, AjMMP1 and AjMMP19 were upregulated to 1.99- and 1.85-fold, respectively. AjTIMP1 siRNA-KD can promote ROS production by 26.2%, whereas AjMMP1 siRNA-KD can eliminate the increase in ROS. In inflamed tissues, collagen I and III levels were decreased by 33.1% and 33.6%, respectively, in the AjTIMP1 siRNA group at 24 h AjTIMP1 was involved in the inflammatory response by mediating ROS formation and collagen degradation.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0145-305X	1879-0089		WOS:000710171300006	34662683

So far, owing to the unique properties and characteristics, the transition metal phosphides (TMPs) have been proven to be high performance co-catalysts to replace some of the classic precious metal materials in the photocatalytic water splitting. In the present work, we report a novel copper phosphide (Cu3P) as a cocatalyst to form a well-designed fabricated photocatalyst with blacktrumpet mushroom-like ZnS semiconductor for the first time. The synthesis of Cu3P/ZnS consists of two-step hydrothermal and ball milling methods. The physical properties of the materials so prepared were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), ultraviolet-visible diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (UV-DRS), X-ray photo-electron spectroscopy (XPS) and Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) analyses. In order to study the role of Cu3P, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements were used to investigate the photogenerated charge properties of ZnS. The experiments of photocatalytic production of H-2 confirm that the Cu3P co-catalysts effectively promote the separation of photogenerated charge carriers in ZnS, and consequently enhance the H-2 evolution activity. The 3% Cu3P/ZnS sample delivers the highest catalyst activity and the consistent H-2 evolution rate is14,937 mu mol h(-1) g(cat)(1), which is 10-fold boosted compared to the pristine ZnS. The stability of the catalyst was tested by reusing the used 3% Cu3P/ZnS photocatalyst in five consecutive runs, and their respective activity in the H-2 production activity was evaluated. A possible mechanism is proposed and discussed. (C) 2021 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.									10	0	0	0	1	0	10			0021-9797	1095-7103		WOS:000624037400009	33524723

The organic matter in ancient paddy soils that have long been under obturation has already altered in nature and composition. Infrared spectrum is an important means that can be used to characterize chemical structure and physical properties of polymers. As organic matter in the soil absorbs the different wavelength spectra selectively,a large amount of information about the nature,reaction characteristics and structure of oxygen-containing functional groups can be extracted from infrared spectrograms for identification. Since the organic matter in the buried ancient paddy soil is very complex in structure,how to analyze various functional groups in organic matter is a significant problem that needs to be solved in the present study. 【Method】The soil organic matter in the ancient paddy soil profiles at Sanlonggang of the Liyang Plain,demonstrated clean traits of accumulation and transformation as affected by cultivation age,environmental condition,and burial depth. So soil samples,were collected from the ancient paddy soil layers and the modern paddy soil layer of the profiles for infrared spectral analysis using the potassium bromide pressed disc method,to identify functional groups in the organic matter therein and characterize structures of the groups separately,in an attempt to provide some theoretical and practical bases for revealing structural characteristics and evolution processes of the organic matter in the buried ancient paddy soil. 【Result】Results show that the organic matter in the ancient paddy soil has become an inherent component of the soil under long-term burial and carbonization and hard to get leached,thus leading to accumulation of the matter relative to the modern paddy soil. The vibrations in the infrared spectrum of the ancient paddy soil are mainly composed of those of halogen and inorganic compounds,and some others of functional groups like olefins,aromatics and hydroxyl compounds. The wave at Band 1 882 cm~(-1)(carbon olefin)of the infrared spectrum of the ancient paddy soil weakens obviously after organic matter is removed from the soil and the vibration of functional groups is mainly the stretching vibration of unsaturated C-H. In the infrared spectrum of the original red soil,the absorbance is lower with the ancient paddy soil than with the modern paddy soil at the wave band 3 620~1 631 cm~(-1),but higher with the former than with the latter at the wave band of 1 631~470 cm~(-1),which suggests that the benzene rings are gradually forming with alkenes gradually aromatized and halogen and inorganic ions bound more intensely. First-ordered reciprocal(FD value)of the infrared spectrum shows that the ancient paddy soil does not vary much from the modern paddy soil;After organic matter is removed from the ancient paddy soil,peaks in its infrared spectrum are all weakened,especially FD peaks,which all drop below their respective ones in the infrared spectrum of the soil without removing organic matter,which demonstrates that the functional groups bound with organic matter are weakened in the soil after organic matter is removed,and the presence of organic matter can highlight the infrared spectral features of the structural functional groups of organic matter.【Conclusion】In the infrared spectrum of the soil with organic matter removed,the ancient paddy soil is lower than the modern paddy soil in absorbance at all wave bands,which suggesting that organic matter has a greater influence on functional groups in the ancient paddy soil.			澧阳平原杉龙岗古水稻土遗址剖面中不同耕作年限、不同环境条件、不同深埋的有机质的积累与迁移变化明显。以澧阳平原杉龙岗古水稻土遗址为研究对象,采用溴化钾压片法对剖面中古水稻土和现代耕作水稻土进行红外光谱测定,分析土壤中有机质的官能基团以及各基团的结构特征。结果表明,古水稻土官能基团的振动主要集中在卤素化合物和无机化合物,有机质对古水稻土官能团影响很大,其中,古水稻土中波数1 882 cm~(-1)(烯烃碳)在去有机质后吸收峰弱化;古水稻土中波数为1 631~470 cm~(-1)段,逐渐形成苯环、烯烃化合物且芳构化程度增加,卤素和无机化合物的结合力增强。由一阶导数可知,古水稻土与现代耕作水稻土相差不大,在去有机质后,波峰均被弱化且FD值峰值均小于去有机质前FD值。						0	4	0		1	0	4			0564-3929			CSCD:5752349		
J	Sheptovitsky, YG; Brudvig, GW								Isolation and characterization of spinach photosystem II membrane-associated catalase and polyphenol oxidase								BIOCHEMISTRY				35	50			16255	16263		10.1021/bi9613842				DEC 17 1996	1996	Photosystem II (PSII) membranes exhibit catalase and polyphenol oxidase (PPO) activities. Mild heat treatment of PSII membranes for 90 min at 30 degrees C releases most of these enzyme activities into the supernatant, accompanied by a 7-fold activation of PPO. In contrast, mild heat treatment of thylakoid membranes does not release significant amounts of either activity, indicating that both enzymes are bound to the luminal surface of the thylakoid membrane. The heat-released PSII membrane-associated catalase and PPO have been purified and characterized. Catalase activity was correlated with a 63 kDa polypeptide which was purified by batch adsorption to anion-exchange beads followed by gel filtration. The PSII membrane-associated catalase is unstable in solution, probably due to irreversible aggregation. The enzyme was characterized in terms of molecular and subunit size, amino-acid composition, UV-visible absorption, heme content, pH optimum, inhibitor sensitivity, and K-m value for H2O2. Its properties indicate that the PSII membrane-associated catalase is a luminal thylakoid membrane-bound heme enzyme that has not been identified previously. The residual catalase activity of PSII membranes after mild heat treatment is irreversibly inhibited with 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole, a specific inhibitor of heme catalases, without inhibition of O-2-evolution activity. This result indicates that little, if any, of the catalase activity from PSII membranes in the dark is catalyzed by the O-2-evolving center of PSII. PPO activity was correlated with a 48 kDa polypeptide. However, the 48 kDa polypeptide and another heat-released polypeptide of 72 kDa have the same N-terminal sequence, which is also identical to that of a known 64 kDa protein [Hind, G., Marshak, D. R., & Coughlan, S. J. (1995) Biochemistry 34, 8157-8164]. During heat treatment of PSII membranes and further manipulations it was found that the 72 kDa polypeptide was largely converted into the 48 kDa polypeptide. Thus, the 72 kDa polypeptide appears to be a latent precursor of the active 48 kDa PPO. The PSII membrane-associated PPO was purified by anion-exchange chromatography and was characterized in terms of substrate specificity, pH optimum, inhibitor sensitivity and native molecular weight. The heat-released PPO appears to be identical to the enzyme previously isolated from spinach thylakoid membranes [Golbeck, J. H., & Cammarata, K. V. (1981) Plant Physiol. 67, 977-984].									50	2	1	0	37	0	54			0006-2960			WOS:A1996VY89700034	8973199

Here, a full-length Prx1 cDNA sequence (PmPrx1) was isolated from Penaeus monodon. The PmPrx1 cDNA was 951 base pairs (bp), encoding 198 amino acid polypeptides. The results of qRT-PCR showed that the PmPrx1 mRNA was ubiquitously expressed in all tissues tested and had a comparatively high expression level in immune-associated tissues (gill, hepatopancreas). To explore the immune and anti-stress roles of PmPrx1, the gills and hepatopancreas were chosen as target tissues in Penaeus monodon and were challenged with bacteria (Vibrio harveyi and Streptococcus agalactiae) and toxic environmental stresses. To further clarify the immune function of PmPrx1 after bacterial challenge, the recombinant PmPrx1 protein was acquired using a prokaryotic expression method. The antioxidant activity of the recombinant PmPrx1 was assessed by the catalyzing hydrogen peroxide assay method, and the results showed obvious antioxidant activity in a dose-dependent and temperature-dependent manner. The antimicrobial activity of purified PmPrx1 protein was evaluated and further studied in vitro relying on a bacterial growth inhibition test which was conducted in both liquid and solid cultures. Furthermore, E. coli transferred with pRSET-PmPrx1 was dramatically protected in response to metal toxicity and H2O2 oxidative stress. In summary, this study provides useful information about the role of the Prx1 gene in defense against a variety of toxic factors in shrimps that help to further clarify the functional mechanism of Prx.

The gene encodes a polypeptide of 333 residues, of which the first 76 residues served as transit peptides for transfer across the chloroplast envelope and thylakoid membrane. The mature protein consists of 257 amino acids with a calculated molecular mass of 28,290 Da. The sequence homology of the mature 33 kDa protein was 42.9-50.8% between the red alga and cyanobacteria, and 44.7-48.6% between the red alga and higher plants. The cloned gene was expressed in Escherichia coli, and the recombinant protein was purified, subjected to protease-treatments. The cleavage sites of the 33 kDa protein by chymotrypsin or V8 protease were determined and compared among a cyanobacterium (Synechococcus elongatus), a euglena (Euglena gracilis), a green alga (Chlamydomonas reinhardtii) and two higher plants (Spinacia oleracea and Otyza sativa). The cleavage sites by chymotrypsin were at 156F and 190F for the cyanobacterium, 159M, 160F and 192L for red alga, 11Y and 151F for euglena, 10Yand 150F for green alga, and 16Y for spinach, respectively. The cleavage sites by V8 protease were at 181E (cyanobacterium), 182E and 195E (red alga), 13E, 67E, 69E, 153D and 181E (euglena), 176E and 180E (green alga), and 18E or 19E (higher plants). Since most of the residues at these cleavage sites were conserved among the six organisms, the results indicate that the structure of the 33 kDa protein, at least the structure based on the accessibility by proteases, is different among these organisms. In terms of the cleavage sites, the structure of the 33 kDa protein can be divided into three major groups: cyanobacterial and red algal-type has cleavage sites at residues around 156-195, higher planttype at residues 16-19, and euglena and green algal-type at residues of both cyanobacterial and higher plant-types.									24	0	0	0	24	0	24			0032-0781			WOS:000175118800010	11978871

Improving the formation and the exposure of active sites is a key issue in the design of cost-effective and efficient metal-based electrocatalysts, especially for noble metals, in order to cut down the metal content and improve the mass activity of the metals, while maintaining high catalytic activity. Herein, we report a high-performance Ru-based electrocatalyst consisting of Ru single atoms and Ru nanoclusters encapsulated in highly porous N-doped carbon with abundant hierarchical pores (Ru/p-NC). Remarkably, Ru/p-NC shows excellent HER activity in 1.0 M KOH with a low overpotential of 10 mV at 10 mA cm(-2), a small Tafel slope of 17 mV dec(-1) as well as good durability for 24 h, outperforming commercial Pt/C and Ru/C catalysts. More importantly, the mass activity and turnover frequency (based on Ru loading) of Ru/p-NC are ultrahigh owing to the low loading of Ru, which are 17 A mg(Ru)(-1) and 8.9 H-2 s(-1), respectively, at a very low overpotential of 25 mV. Experimental results indicate that the porous N-doped carbon support not only leads to exposed active sites but also interacts strongly with the Ru moieties. In addition, it tunes the electronic structure of the catalyst, boosts the stability as well as facilitates mass transport and charge transfer kinetics. This work provides a new route for the synthesis of metal-based porous N-doped carbon hybrid electrocatalysts with abundant exposed active sites and strong metal-support interaction for energy conversion.									9	0	0	0	1	0	9			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000649673200001

Pure g-C3N4 with a band gap energy of 2.7 eV (460 nm) makes it an applicable and efficient visible-active photocatalyst for energy conversion and environmental applications. This is because of its appropriate electronic band structures, efficient optical absorption, and extraordinary thermal and chemical stability. Currently, the major focus in photocatalysis research is on the design and development of visible-light-driven photocatalysts that are stable and highly efficient for practical applications. In this current mini-review, a comprehensive survey is conducted on graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) as a metal-free novel visible-light photocatalyst and the progress in the synthesis and design of high-efficiency g-C3N4-based nanomaterial photocatalysts with controllable structures and morphologies is discussed in detail. Various approaches for modifying the electronic band structure and visible-light harvesting, including metal (cation), non-metal (anion) doping, noble metal loading, and composite formation with other semiconductors are discussed in detail. Photocatalytic applications of g-C3N4 as metal-free catalysts in photocatalytic water splitting for hydrogen production, CO2 photoreduction, organic pollutant degradation, and bacterial disinfections are introduced and discussed in detail. Finally, this critical mini-review summarizes some outlooks on the ongoing challenges in the development of efficient and low cost metal-free g-C3N4 systems, which provide a good complement to the literature on g-C3N4 based metal-free nanomaterial photocatalysts.									91	4	0	0	11	0	93			2398-4902			WOS:000492020200002

In this work, we have incorporated cobalt ferrite nanocrystals as co-catalyst in a hydrothermally synthesized tungsten oxide (WO3) photoanode with an aim to arrest the fast recombination process. Characterization of the nanocomposite containing 5 mol% cobalt ferrite by multiple te chniques confirmed formation of monoclinic WO(3)nanoplate like structures containing stoichiometric CoFe(2)O(4)phase whereas optical absorption spectroscopy gave its optical band gap as 2.1 eV. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), Mott-Schottky analysis and linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) were conducted under illuminated (1.5AM G solar simulated light) and dark conditions that revealed a reduction in the onset potential of pristine tungsten oxide photoanode by similar to 0.25 V as a result of incorporation of 5 mol% cobalt ferrite nanocrystals owing to an efficient electron transfer before recombination. The photocurrent obtained from the composite photoanode was also found to be 10 times higher than that from bare tungsten oxide photoanode suggesting its potential use as anode material for photo-electrochemical water splitting.									11	0	0	0	0	0	11			0925-3467	1873-1252		WOS:000612703200005

A 2.45-GHz solid-state microwave source was used to generate the plasma used in this article. The PAC platform consisted of a triple-layered coaxial cylindrical quartz combustor with the argon plasma conducted in the innermost cylinder and the premixed methane/air as the coflow. This configuration allowed for the coupling of the plasma and reactants outside the combustor making the plasma-assisted ignition region accessible to the cavity ringdown beam. Optical emission spectroscopy and visual imaging were used to obtain information about the excited state species along with plasma and flame geometries, respectively. Increasing the plasma power at a constant fuel equivalence ratio resulted in a blue inverted cone-shaped flame anchored to the tip of the plasma. A single peak was observed in the excited state OH(A) emission profile in the hybrid zone, whereas no OH(X) peak was observed in the hybrid zone. The OH(X) number density was measured at 0.12 x 10(15) molecules/cm(3) at z = 2 mm before increasing to a peak of 1.85 x 10(15) molecules/cm(3) at z = 8 mm, then subsequently dropping off. The representation of both OH(A) and OH(X) provides a complete picture of the role played by the OH radical, an important intermediate specie in the microwave generated argon PAC of a methane/air mixture. The ability to track the evolution of both states of the OH radical in the ignition zone further sheds light on the role played by this important species in influencing the plasma enhancements of a premixed methane/air combustion. The results obtained further confirmed the hypothesis that OH(X) is more involved in the stabilization reactions, whereas OH (A) is more prevalent in the ignition process.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0093-3813	1939-9375		WOS:000546900000039		
J	KHOKHLOV, A; MULLER, E; HOFLICH, P								LIGHT CURVES OF TYPE-IA SUPERNOVA MODELS WITH DIFFERENT EXPLOSION MECHANISMS								ASTRONOMY & ASTROPHYSICS				270	1-2			223	248						MAR 1993	1993	Bolometric, blue and visual light curves are presented for a set of theoretical models for Type Ia supernovae including deflagration, detonation, delayed detonation, pulsating delayed detonation and tamped detonation scenarios.The explosions are calculated using a one-dimensional Lagrangian code consistently with a nuclear reaction network (Khokhlov 1991b,c). For the calculations of the light curves a code is used (Hoflich et al. 1992a,b) which is based on a LTE radiation transfer scheme (including both an energy equation for matter and radiation, and effects due to electron and line scattering). The transfer scheme implicitly solves the time-dependent, frequency averaged moment equations. The light curve code further contains a detailed equation of state with an elaborate treatment of the ionization balance and the ionization energies. Time-dependent expansion opacities (both Rosseland and Planck means) are used in a local approximation, which takes into account the composition structure of the explosion model. The code finally contains a Monte Carlo gamma-ray deposition scheme, which handles all relevant gamma-ray transitions and interaction processes.We find that below a temperature of about 2 10(4) K the opacity rapidly drops from a value of greater than or similar to 0.1 cm2/g by more than an order of magnitude. This drop in opacity leads to a transition from the optically thick to the optically thin regime, which in turn determines to first order the time of maximum light. The transition occurs at different times in models with different expansion rates and structures. Consequently, the absolute value of the opacity does only weakly influence the time of maximum light as long as the opacity above the transition temperature is larger than almost-equal-to 0.1 cm2/g. This is in strict contrast to light curve models using a constant opacity. The light curves of the investigated models further strongly differ in their brightness at maximum light, the width of the maximum, and their post-maximum decline rate. These differences can be understood in terms of the expansion rate of the ejecta, the total energy release, the distribution of the radioactive matter, and the total mass and density structure of the envelope.Several correlations between observable quantities and model parameters are found, which allow for a discrimination between models. For example, the maximum bolometric brightness decreases with the rise time t(bol) and increases with the total mass of radioactive Ni-56 . The photospheric velocity at t(bol) increases with L(bol).Rise times to maximum bolometric luminosity longer than almost-equal-to 15 days can hardly be provided by ''standard'' models (i.e., deflagrations, detonations or delayed detonations), but require ''non-standard'' models (i.e., pulsating delayed detonations or tamped detonations). These two classes of models can be distinguished by the time dependence of the expansion velocity at the photosphere v(ph), which is directly measurable by the Doppler shift of spectral lines. Contrary to the ''standard'' models, the ''non-standard'' models show a distinct plateau in v(ph) after maximum whose width is determined by the envelope mass. The investigated ''standard'' models all have an absolute visual magnitude of M(V) = -19.68m +/- 0.12m, while ''non-standard'' models have a systematically lower maximum brightness being as low as M(V) = -19.2m and decreasing with increasing envelope mass. Thus, if the photospheric velocity shows a plateau, the supernova should be used with care when determining the Hubble constant.									166	1	2	0	0	0	168			0004-6361			WOS:A1993KU56700027

Chromium-isotope in ancient carbonates has shown its ability to trace the oxygenation history of the atmosphere-hydrosphere system. In this study, we analyzed Cr-isotope and Ce-anomaly data of carbonates from the Ediacaran Doushantuo and Dengying formations in the Yangtze Gorges area, South China, in order to reconstruct oxygenation variations in the atmosphere and shallow seawaters of the Yangtze Platform during the Ediacaran Period.After evaluating and excluding detrital and diagenetic effects, well-preserved delta Cr-53(auth) signatures were obtained. Post-Marinoan carbonates record slightly positive delta Cr-53(auth) values (0.18-0.43 parts per thousand) and slightly negative Ce-anomaly, suggesting generally oxidizing conditions in the atmosphere (with pO(2) over 1% PAL) and in shallow seawaters of the Yangtze Platform during the post-Marinoan phase, which may have been related to the diversity of early Ediacaran organisms. Shuram/Wonoka correlative carbonates are characterized by the fluctuations of delta Cr-53(auth) values (-0.25 to 0.97 parts per thousand) and a significant negative delta C-13 excursion, which may have resulted from partial oxidation of the large deep-water DOC reservoir under enhanced oxidative weathering conditions. This process released C-13-depleted carbon into DIC pool and isotopically unfractionated Cr (III) into water columns, the latter of which immediately precipitated by adsorption onto the detrital materials. Meanwhile, an increase in local anoxia (and even euxinia) in the intrashelf basin of the Yangtze Platform driven by enhanced microbial sulfate reduction and the resultant H2S, possibly limited regional biological evolution during this phase. Late Ediacaran carbonates record elevated delta Cr-53(auth) values (0.40-0.96 parts per thousand) together with the decreasing trend in Ce/Ce* values, indicating a more oxygenated environment in the atmosphere and shallow seawaters of the Yangtze Platform during the late Ediacaran phase, which may have been beneficial to the diversification of late Ediacaran animals.									38	4	0	0	7	1	41			0301-9268	1872-7433		WOS:000436883700006

The as-synthesized nanoparticles have been well characterised by X-ray diffraction (XRD), Furrier transform infra-red (FTIR), UV-visible (UV-Vis) spectroscopic techniques, energy dispersive analysis of X-ray (EDAX), BET surface area, thermogravimetric (TG) analysis and transmission electron microscopic (TEM) techniques. The XRD shows face centred cubic (FCC) structure, the FTIR demonstrated a major bands appeared at 574 cm(-1) and 669 cm(-1) are suggesting the (Co-O) vibrational mode of Co3O4. The TEM of Co3O4 NPs has been confirmed its ultra-small particle size is of similar to 2 nm +/- 0.5 nm. Whereas, EDAX shows the only cobalt and oxygen are available confirms Co3O4 having high BET surface area. The fabricated Co3O4 acted as a highly sensitive electrochemical sensor for the determination of SCB by using linear Sweep voltammetry (LSV), cyclic voltammetry (CV), electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) in 0.5 M KOH solution. Significantly, anodic onset potential observed at 0.2 V vs. SCE, linear range of scan rate and concentration (1 mM-100 mM) with (LOD 0.13 and LOQ 0.46) and high current and potential stability with pH dependent behaviour confirms Co3O4 based electrocatalytic system is good for oxidative determination of SCB. The selectivity of the sensor also tested by using mixture of other environmental active species with SCB by using LSV measurements. This proposed system is applicable in food and pharmaceutical industries for the determination of SCB as an amperometric sensor. (C) 2020 The Korean Society of Industrial and Engineering Chemistry.

The circulating species and their clinical impact were not described in Argentina.Objectives: To describe the molecular epidemiology of HRV in children and to determine the association of HRV species with outcome and severity.Study design: Hospitalized and outpatients children <6 years old with ARI without comorbidities (n = 620) were enrolled (2008-2010). Demographic, clinical data and outcome were analyzed. HRV were identified by RT-PCR. Phylogenetic analysis and demographic reconstruction for HRV were performed in selected samples.Results: HRV were detected in 2521620(40.6%) of children; 8.5% in viral coinfection. Bronchiolitis (55%) and pneumonia (13%) were the most frequent clinical diagnosis. Of 202 inpatients with HRV: 72% required oxygen supplementation, 11% intensive care unit and 3% mechanical ventilation. HRV were identified as a risk factor for hospitalization (OR: 2.47).All three HRV species were detected being HRV-A (55%) and HRV-C (43%) the most frequent; HRV-B was infrequent (2%). Of 44 sequenced HRV, 30 genotypes were detected. Seven of them were the most prevalent and circulated during limited periods of time. The demographic reconstruction revealed a constant population size and a high turnover rate of genotypes. Demographic and clinical outcome were similar for HRV-A and HRV-C infections.Conclusion: This study highlights the clinical impact of HRV in children without comorbidities as a cause of lower ARI and hospitalization. The high frequency of HRV infections may be associated with the simultaneous circulation of genotypes and their high turnover rate. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

J	Hienerwadel, R; Boussac, A; Breton, J; Berthomieu, C				Berthomieu, Catherine/AAX-9559-2021	Berthomieu, Catherine/0000-0001-8784-5396			Fourier transform infrared difference study of tyrosine(D) oxidation and plastoquinone Q(A) reduction in photosystem II								BIOCHEMISTRY				35	48			15447	15460		10.1021/bi961952d				DEC 3 1996	1996	Two redox active tyrosines are present in the homologous polypeptides D1 and D2 of photosystem II (PS II). Tyr(z)(D1-161) is involved in the electron transfer reactions resulting in oxygen evolution, while Tyro (D2-160) usually form a dark-stable radical. In Mn-depleted PS II, Tyr(D)(.) can be slowly reduced by exogenous reductants. Charge separation then results in the oxidation of Tyro and Tyr(z) and the reduction of the primary electron acceptor Q(A). The semiquinone Q(A)(-) can be reoxidized by oxidants like ferricyanide. In the present work, experimental conditions leading to the generation of pure Q(A)(-)/Q(A) or Tyr(D)(.)/Tyr(D) FTIR difference spectra have been optimized. Therefore, single-turnover flashes or short illuminations were performed on PS II samples in the presence of exogenous reductants or oxidants. The Q(A)(-) and Tyr(D)(.) radicals were generated with high yield and with a lifetime of several seconds or minutes allowing averaging of FTIR difference spectra with high signal to noise ratio. Both Q(A)(-) formation and contributions at the electron donor side of PS II were monitored by EPR spectroscopy. In PS II samples at pH 6 in the presence of PMS, NH2OH, and DCMU, EPR measurements show that Q(A)(-) is formed with high yield upon a 1 s illumination at 10 degrees C, while no radical from the electron donor side of PS II is detected. Therefore the Q(A)(-)/Q(A) FTIR spectrum obtained in these conditions shows only vibrational changes due to QA reduction in PS II. In contrast, a similar spectrum was recently interpreted in terms of dominant contributions from Chl(+)/Chl signals [MacDonald, G. M., Steenhuis, J. J., & Barry, B. A. (1995) J. Biol. Chem. 270, 8420-8428], although the contribution from the electron acceptor QA was not quantified. In particular, it is shown here that the large positive signal at 1478 cm(-1) is due to the Q(A)(-) State and not to a Chl(+) mode. This band is not downshifted upon N-15-labeling of spinach PS II membranes within the +/- 1 cm(-1) accuracy of the method and is therefore tentatively assigned to the nu(C - O) mode of the plastosemiquinone Q(A)(-). Also unchanged upon N-15-labeling, signals at 1644 and/or 1630 cm(-1) are possible candidates for the v(C=O) models) of neutral QA in PS II. The Tyr(D)(.)/Tyr(D) FTIR spectrum is recorded at 4 degrees C on Tris-washed PS II membranes from spinach at pH 6 in the presence of phosphate, formate, and ferricyanide. EPR experiments performed on these samples show that almost all Tyr(D)(.) is formed upon a 1 s illumination at 4 degrees C and that Ty(D)(.) is then reduced within 12 min in the dark. No contributions from Tyr(z)(.) or Q(A)(-) are detected 2 s after illumination. It is thus possible to optimize experimental conditions to record the FTIR difference spectrum only due to Tyro photooxidation in PS II-enriched membranes of spinach. The Tyr(D)(.)/Tyr(D) FTIR spectrumis compared to a cresol(.)/cresol FTIR difference spectrum obtained by UV irradiation at 10 K of cresol at pH 8. The spectral analogies observed between the in vive and in vitro spectra recorded either in H2O or in D2O suggest that IR modes of Tyro contribute at 1513 and 1252 cm(-1).These frequencies are characteristic of a protonated tyrosine. A positive signal is observed at 1506 cm(-1) for cresol(.) and at 1504 cm(-1) for the Tyr(D)(.) state. This suggests contribution of the Tyr(D)(.) side chain at 1504 cm(-1). A band at 1473 cm(-1) was previously assigned to the v(CO) mode of Tyr(D)(.) [MacDonald, C. M., Bixby, K. A., & Barry, B. A. (1993) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 90, 11024-11028]. In contrast, no positive signal is observed at 1473 cm(-1) in the Tyr(D)(.)/Tyr(D) FTIR difference spectrum presented here. The Tyr(D)(.)/Tyr(D) spectrum also shows vibrational changes from peptide groups and amino acid side chains which are modified upon Tyr(D)(.) formation. Proton release at the PS II protein surface upon Tyr(D)(.) formation is deduced from differential signals at the v(PO) modes of phosphate.									59	0	1	0	46	0	60			0006-2960			WOS:A1996VW43900040	8952498

We analyzed the levels of nif transcripts of Synechococcus ecotypes, NifH subunit and nitrogenase activity over the diel cycle in the microbial mat of an alkaline hot spring in Yellowstone National Park. The results showed a rise in nif transcripts in the evening, with a subsequent decline over the course of the night. In contrast, immunological data demonstrated that the level of the NifH polypeptide remained stable during the night, and only declined when the mat became oxic in the morning. Nitrogenase activity was low throughout the night; however, it exhibited two peaks, a small one in the evening and a large one in the early morning, when light began to stimulate cyanobacterial photosynthetic activity, but O-2 consumption by respiration still exceeded the rate of O-2 evolution. Once the irradiance increased to the point at which the mat became oxic, the nitrogenase activity was strongly inhibited. Transcripts for proteins associated with energy-producing metabolisms in the cell also followed diel patterns, with fermentation-related transcripts accumulating at night, photosynthesis- and respiration-related transcripts accumulating during the day and late afternoon, respectively. These results are discussed with respect to the energetics and regulation of N-2 fixation in hot spring mats and factors that can markedly influence the extent of N-2 fixation over the diel cycle.									96	1	0	0	87	1	97			1751-7362			WOS:000255288700003	18323780	
J	Moriwaki, Y; Yamamoto, T; Higashino, K								Enzymes involved in purine metabolism - A review of histochemical localization and functional implications								HISTOLOGY AND HISTOPATHOLOGY				14	4			1321	1340						OCT 1999	1999	Many enzymes are involved in the biosynthesis, interconversion, and degradation of purine compounds. The exact function of these enzymes is still unknown, but they seem to play important roles other than in purine metabolism. To elucidate their functional roles, it is imperative to clarify their tissue distribution at the cellular or subcellular level. The present review summarizes the currently available information about their histochemical localization and proposed functions.In general, 5'-nucleotidase has been considered as a marker enzyme for the plasma membrane, and is considered to be a key enzyme in the generation of adenosine, a potential vasodilator. However, from its wide range of localization in tissues it is also considered to be related to the membrane movement of cells in the transitional epithelium, cellular motile response, transport process, cellular growth, synthesis of fibrous protein and calcification, lymphocyte activation, neurotransmission, and oxygen sensing mechanism. Adenosine deaminase (ADA) is present in all tissues in mammals. Although the main function of ADA is the development of the immune system in humans, it seems to be associated with the differentiation of epithelial cells and monocytes, neurotransmission, and maintenance of gestation. Purine nucleoside phosphorylase (PNP) is generally considered as a cytosolic enzyme, but recently, mitochondrial PNP, a different protein from cytosolic PNP, was reported. PNP is also widely expressed in human tissues. It is found in most tissues of the body, but the highest activity is in peripheral blood granulocyte and lymphoid tissues. It is also related to the development of T-cell immunity in humans as is ADA. Moreover, its contribution to centriole replication and/or regulation of microtubule assembly has been suggested. Immunohistochemical localization of xanthine oxidase has been reported in various tissues from various animal species. Xanthine oxidase has been suggested to be involved in the pathogenesis of post-ischemic reperfusion tissue injury through the generation of reactive oxygen species, while the extensive tissue localization of xanthine dehydrogenase/oxidase suggests several other roles for this enzyme, including a protective barrier against bacterial infection by producing either superoxide radicals or uric acid. Furthermore, an involvement in cellular proliferation and differentiation has been suggested. Urate oxidase is generally considered a liver-specific enzyme, except for bovines which possess this enzyme in the kidney. Urate oxidase is exclusively located in the peroxisomes of fish, frogs, and rats, but was lost in birds, some reptiles, arid primates during evolution. A histochemical demonstration of allantoin-degrading enzymes has not been performed, but these enzymes have been located in peroxisomes by sucrose density gradient centrifugation. AMP deaminase activity is higher in skeletal muscle than in any other tissues. AMP deaminase may be involved in a number of physiological processes, such as the conversion of adenine nucleotide to inosine or guanine nucleotide, stabilizing the adenylate energy charge, and the reaction of the purine nucleotide cycle. There are three distinct isozymes (A, B, C) with different kinetic, physical, and immunological properties. Isozymes A., B, C have been isolated from muscle, liver (kidney), and heart tissue, respectively. In the muscle, AMP deaminase isozymes exist in a different part, suggesting a multiple functional role of this enzyme. High hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (HGPRT) activity is found in some regions of a normal adult human brain. However, very little is known regarding the histochemical tissue localization of HGPRT. Immunohistochemical localization of its developmental expression suggests that HGPRT may not be essential for purine nucleotide supplement in the segmentation of brain cells, but may play a significant role in the developing hippocampus.									141	3	2	0	129	1	149			0213-3911	1699-5848		WOS:000082470300031	10506947

In flowering plants, two main groups of alpha-DOXs have been described. While the alpha-DOX1 isoforms are mainly involved in defense responses against microbial infection and herbivores, the alpha-DOX2 isoforms are mostly related to development. To gain insight into the roles played by these enzymes during land plant evolution, we performed biochemical, genetic and molecular analyses to examine the function of the single copy moss Physcomitrella patens alpha-DOX (Pp alpha-DOX) in development and defense against pathogens.Results: Recombinant Pp alpha-DOX protein catalyzed the conversion of fatty acids into 2-hydroperoxy derivatives with a substrate preference for alpha-linolenic, linoleic and palmitic acids. Pp alpha-DOX is expressed during development in tips of young protonemal filaments with maximum expression levels in mitotically active undifferentiated apical cells. In leafy gametophores, Pp alpha-DOX is expressed in auxin producing tissues, including rhizoid and axillary hairs. Pp alpha-DOX transcript levels and Pp alpha-DOX activity increased in moss tissues infected with Botrytis cinerea or treated with Pectobacterium carotovorum elicitors. In B. cinerea infected leaves, Pp alpha-DOX-GUS proteins accumulated in cells surrounding infected cells, suggesting a protective mechanism. Targeted disruption of Pp alpha-DOX did not cause a visible developmental alteration and did not compromise the defense response. However, overexpressing Pp alpha-DOX, or incubating wild-type tissues with Pp alpha-DOX-derived oxylipins, principally the aldehyde heptadecatrienal, resulted in smaller moss colonies with less protonemal tissues, due to a reduction of caulonemal filament growth and a reduction of chloronemal cell size compared with normal tissues. In addition, Pp alpha-DOX overexpression and treatments with Pp alpha-DOX-derived oxylipins reduced cellular damage caused by elicitors of P. carotovorum.Conclusions: Our study shows that the unique alpha-DOX of the primitive land plant P. patens, although apparently not crucial, participates both in development and in the defense response against pathogens, suggesting that alpha-DOXs from flowering plants could have originated by duplication and successive functional diversification after the divergence from bryophytes.									15	0	0	0	13	0	15			1471-2229			WOS:000350068100001	25848849

The three types of porous nickel compound films grown on nickel foam with a thickness of similar to 8 mu m have been used as anodes and cathodes in a two-electrode setup for overall water splitting. The electrode pairing of NixMy//NixMy (M = O, S, and P) for electrocatalysis in order of superiority is as follows: NiO//Ni2P > Ni3S2//Ni2P > Ni2P//Ni2P > Ni3S2//Ni3S2 > NiO//Ni3S2 > wNiO//NiO. The other two sets of NixMy with different thicknesses of similar to 5 and similar to 11 mu m also follow the abovementioned order. The well matched electrode pair of NiOOER//Ni2PHER only needs 1.65 V, whereas NiO//NiO pair needs 1.84 V to afford the current of 10 mA cm(-2) in 1 mol L-1 of aqueous KOH solution. In particular, the current density retention of the NiO//Ni2P reached 92% after 120 hours of electrolysis at 1.70 V (NiO//NiO only maintains 72% after 30-hour electrolysis). The novelty of this study focuses on fabricating a well matched electrode pair to substantially enhance its electrochemical performance and durability, which would provide a new insight into developing non- noble, highly efficient, and stable electrode pairs.									102	6	0	0	2	0	102			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000397968400007	28116394

However, the effective introduction of cation vacancies into electrocatalysts still remains a challenge. Herein, we present and elucidate a facile "fast reduction and in situ phase transformation" strategy at room temperature to simultaneously introduce abundant metal cation vacancies (cobalt vacancies and iron vacancies) into Co0.5Fe0,500H electrocatalysts. The incorporation of the Fe element could tailor the micrometer-sized ultrathin CoOOH platelets into nanometer-sized ultrathin Co05Fe0s00H platelets, and the tailoring process is accompanied with the generation of numerous cation vacancies. The defect degree of CoOOH could be effectively tuned by the incorporation of Fe, resulting in more active sites and lower energy barrier, and thereby the intrinsic catalytic activity of electrocatalysts was further enhanced. Compared to CoOOH, the optimized nanometer-sized ultrathin Co0.5Fe0600H platelets (Co0,5Fe0.500H-NSUPs) require a smaller overpotential of 220 mV at a current density of 20 mA cm-2, lower Tafel slope of 38.2 mV dec-1, and better long-term durability without obvious decay for more than 200 h at a high current density of 40 mA cm-2. The electrochemical performances are equal to or better than that of the reported first-class electrocatalysts. More importantly, this work provides new perspective for designing and fabricating efficient multimetal electrocatalysts in large scale.									17	1	0	0	0	0	16			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000477787200034	31245994

Generally, no more than one Prx5 transcript had been reported in non-primate species. In this study, two Prx5 genes (coined as SpPrx5-1 and SpPrx5-2) were firstly isolated from the mud crab, Scylla paramamosain, through RT-PCR and RACE methods. The open reading frame of SpPrx5-1 and SpPrx5-2 were 561 bp and 429 bp in length, encoding 186 and 142 amino acids polypeptide, respectively. Both the conserved signatures of peroxiredoxin catalytic center and Prx5-specific domain were identified in SpPrx5-1 and SpPrx5-2. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that both SpPrx5 clustered together with other animal Prx proteins and were classified into Prx5 subfamily. Tissue specific expression analysis revealed that both SpPrx5-1 and SpPrx5-2 were ubiquitously expressed, highest in hepatopancreas, and showed remarkably similar transcription patterns. Quantitative RT-PCR analysis exhibited that both SpPrx5 genes changed dramatically in hepatopancreas, although showing different expression profiles, after virus-analog poly (I:C) or Vibrio alginolyticus challenge. The expression levels of both SpPrx5s were significantly enhanced in hepatopancreas after poly (I:C) stimulation, while SpPrx5-2 exhibited a more prompt response than SpPrx5-1. Nevertheless, the expression levels of both SpPrx5s were significantly reduced in hepatopancreas after Vibrio alginolyticus challenge in which SpPrx5-1 showed a more prompt response than SpPrx5-2. These results suggested the involvement of SpPrx5s in responses against viral and bacterial infections and further highlighted their functional importance in the immune system of Scylla paramamosain.

Three distinct temperature ranges can be clearly distinguished by active type(s) of protein dynamics: (A) At low temperatures (T < 120 K), the protein dynamics of both dry and hydrated PS 11 is characterized by harmonic vibrational motions. (B) In the intermediate temperature range (120 < T < 240 K), the total mean square displacement < u(2)>(total) slightly deviates from the predicted linear behavior. The QENS data indicate that this deviation, which is virtually independent of the extent of hydration, is due to a partial onset of diffusive protein motions. (C) At temperatures above 240 K, the protein flexibility drastically changes because of the onset of diffusive (large-amplitude) protein motions. This dynamical transition is clearly hydration-dependent since it is strongly suppressed in dry PS II. The thermally activated onset of protein flexibility as monitored by QENS is found to be strictly correlated with the temperature-dependent increase of the electron transport efficiency from Q(A)(-) tO Q(B) (Garbers et al. (1998) Biochemistry 37, 11399-11404). Analogously, the freezing of protein mobility by dehydration in dry PS II appears to be responsible for the blockage of Q(A)(-) reoxidation by Q(B) at hydration values lower than 45% r.h. (Kaminskaya et al. (2003) Biochemistry 42, 8119-8132). Similar effects were observed for reactions of the water-oxidizing complex as outlined in the Discussion section.									60	0	1	0	35	0	61			0006-2960			WOS:000249926300018	17867656

In this study, we hydrothermally synthesized a Fe2O3 photoanode. In addition, d-FeOOH synthesized via dip-coating and hydrothermally prepared h-FeOOH were used as cocatalysts and their synergistic combinations with cobalt phosphate (Co-Pi) were investigated. The synergy between h-FeOOH and Co-Pi was remarkable, whereas that between d-FeOOH and Co-Pi was negligible. For example, the onset potentials of the Co-Pi/h-FeOOH and Co-Pi/d-FeOOH dual catalysts, were cathodically shifted by 270 and 170 mV, respectively. Moreover, the photocurrent density of the Co-Pi/h-FeOOH/Fe2O3 anode was significantly higher than that of the Co-Pi/d-FeOOH/Fe2O3 one. The synergistic effect of Co-Pi and h-FeOOH could be attributed to the significantly inhibited recombination of surface charges owing to the formation of a p-n junction between beta-FeOOH and Fe2O3 and the large contact area between the granular h-FeOOH and Co-Pi. However, the thin amorphous FeOOH layer of the Co-Pi/d-FeOOH/Fe2O3 anode acted as a hole-transfer medium, and weakly promoted the kinetics of the charge transfer process.

Salmonella Typhi persists as a biofilm on gallstones. Hence, we studied the biofilm formation, antibiogram, and virulence genes of S. enterica serovars. Antibiogram of S. enterica serovars from human blood and stool samples were studied by Kirby-Bauer disk diffusion method and biofilm by microtiter plate method. We studied the minimum inhibitory concentration of the isolates by Vitek-2 semiautomated system. Polymerase chain reaction was done to detect invA and spvC genes. Of the 55 isolates studied, 36 (65.45%) were Salmonella Typhi, 13 (23.63%) were Salmonella Paratyphi A, 2 (3.64%) were Salmonella Typhimurium, and 4 (7.28%) were Salmonella spp. Resistance to ciprofloxacin and nalidixic acid were found to be 81.8% and 92.7%, respectively. Chloramphenicol and cotrimoxazole-susceptible strains were 98.18%. One each of Salmonella Typhi, Salmonella Paratyphi A, and S. enterica isolates formed weak biofilm at 28 degrees C. However, at 37 degrees C eight Salmonella Typhi produced weak biofilm in the presence of bile. One Salmonella Paratyphi A and two Salmonella spp. formed weak biofilm in the absence of bile. All the isolates had the invA gene. Salmonella Typhimurium had invA and spvC genes. Bile may contribute to biofilm formation and persistence of the Salmonella Typhi on gallstones, which may lead to carrier state. Changing antibiotic susceptibility pattern of Salmonella serovars is observed in our geographic area. The presence of invA and spvC genes indicate the ability of invasiveness and intracellular survival.									3	0	0	0	2	0	3			1076-6294	1931-8448		WOS:000598561000001	33305986	
J	Warren, PH								Petrologic evidence for low-temperature, possibly flood evaporitic origin of carbonates in the ALH84001 meteorite								JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-PLANETS				103	E7			16759	16773		10.1029/98JE01544				JUL 25 1998	1998	High-temperature models for origin of the carbonates in Martian meteorite ALH84001 are implausible. The impact metasomatism model, invoking reaction between CO;. rich fluid and the host orthopyroxenite, requires conversion of olivine into orthopyroxene, yet olivine in ALH84001 shows no depletion in carbonate-rich areas; or else conversion of orthopyroxene into silica, which should have yielded a higher silica/carbonate ratio. The impact melt model implies that the fracture-linked carbonates, as products of melt injection, should appear as continuous planar veins, but in many areas they do not. Both vapor deposition and impact melting seem inconsistent with the zoned poikilotopic texture of many large carbonates. The popular hydrothermal model is inconsistent with the virtual absence of secondary hydrated silicates in ALH84001. Prior brecciation should have facilitated alteration. Hydrothermal fluids would be warm, and rate of hydration of mafic silicates obeys an Arrhenius law, at least up to similar to 100 degrees C. Most important, hydrothermal episodes tend to last for many years. Many areas of the ancient Martian crust show evidence for massive flooding. I propose that the carbonates formed as evaporite deposits from floodwaters that percolated through the fractures of ALH84001, but only briefly, as evaporation and groundwater flow caused the water table to quickly recede beneath the level of this rock during the later stages of the flood episode. The setting might have been a layer of megaregolith beneath a surface catchment of pooled floodwater, analogous to a playa lake. Carbonate precipitation would occur in response to evaporative concentration of the water. To explain the scarcity of sulfates in ALH84001, the water table must be assumed to recede quickly relative to the rate of evaporation. During the period when ALH84001 was above the water table, evaporation would have slowed, as the evaporation front passed beneath the surface of the debris layer, and possibly earlier, if the shrinking pool of surface water developed a porous sulfate crust. Alternatively, ALH84001 may have developed as a Martian form of calcrete, i.e., the evaporating flood(s) may have been entirely below ground as it (they) passed slowly through ALH84001. The greatest advantage of the flood evaporite model is that it exposes ALH84001 to carbonate precipitation without prolonged exposure to aqueous alteration. The model also seems consistent with the heavy and extremely heterogeneous oxygen isotopic compositions of the carbonates. However, this hypothesis seems no more than marginally consistent with the suggestion of McKay et nl. [1996] that the carbonates are biogenic.									79	0	0	0	6	0	79			2169-9097	2169-9100		WOS:000076970000001	11542298

Low-dimensional solid materials with special atomic and electronic structures are deemed desirable platforms for establishing clear relationships between surface/interface structure characteristics and electrocatalytic activity, representing enormous potential in the pursuit of high-performance electrocatalysts. Recent achievements revealed that surface and interfacial atomic engineering is capable of achieving novel physical and chemical properties as well as superior synergistic effects in inorganic low-dimensional nanomaterials for electrocatalysis. Compared to bulk counterparts, the electronic structure in the surface of inorganic low-dimensional nanomaterials is more sensitive to and can thus be regulated more easily by surface and interfacial modification strategies, resulting in greatly optimized electrocatalytic performance.In this Account, we focus on recent progress in surface and interfacial modification strategies to efficaciously engineer the electrocatalytic performance of inorganic low-dimensional electrode materials. We summarize several important regulation strategies of dimensional confinement, incorporation, surface reconstruction, interface modulation, and defect engineering, which immensely optimize the spin configuration, electrical conductivity, catalytic active site exposure, and reaction energy barrier of inorganic electrode material. At dimensionally confined atomic-scale thickness, more surface-facet atoms are exposed as active sites, which provide an ideal platform for applying surface incorporation and defect engineering, subsequently producing more catalytic active sites and better adsorption free energy for the improvement of catalytic activity. Moreover, regulation of the interfacial character of electrode materials, such as the surface strain, contact area, and bridged bonds, can optimize the electron transfer capacity and reaction kinetics process. On the other hand, once exposed to a strong alkaline solution under oxidizing potentials, the real active layer of electrode materials (such as transition-metal sulfides, nitrides, and phosphides) could be activated by a surface reconstruction strategy, realizing a unique core-shell structure with a highly conductive electron transfer channel inside and highly active catalytic sites outside for electrocatalysis. Based on these points of view, focusing on inorganic low-dimensional electrode materials, the proper choice of surface and interfacial modification strategies would effectively modulate their electrocatalytic activity, realizing unlimited potential applications in promising areas of electrocatalytic water splitting, rechargeable metal batteries, and fuel cells. Overall, we anticipate that surface and interfacial regulation approaches can provide a new understanding of the design of inorganic electrode materials, facilitating the rapid promotion of electrocatalytic performance in electrode materials for electrocatalysis.									131	15	0	0	5	0	133			0001-4842	1520-4898		WOS:000451245900029	30375850

The degree of photoinhibition was determined by means of the ratio of variable to maximum chlorophyll (Chl) fluorescence (F-v/F-m) and electron transport measurements. Compared with the mature needles, the young needles, containing about half the amount of Chl a+b per unit area, exhibited a higher proportion of total carotenoids (Car) as xanthophyll cycle pigments and had an increased ratio of Car/Chl a+b. The potential efficiency of photosystem (PS) 2, F-v/F-m, markedly declined in HI-treated young needles without significant increase of F-0 level. In contrast, the F-v/F-m ratio declined with significant increase of F-0 level in mature needles. In isolated thylakoids, the rate of whole chain and PS2 activity markedly decreased in young HI-needles in comparison with mature needles. A smaller inhibition of PSI activity was observed in both needles. In the subsequent dark incubation, fast recovery was found in both needle types that reached maximum PS2 efficiencies similar to those observed in non-photoinhibited needles. The artificial exogenous electron donors DPC, NH2OH, and Mn2+ failed to restore the HI-induced loss of PS2 activity in mature needles, while DPC and NH2OH significantly restored it in young needles. Hence, HI-inactivation was on the donor side of PS2 in young needles and on the acceptor side of PS2 in mature needles. Quantification of the PS2 reaction centre proteins D1 and 33 kDa protein of water splitting complex following HI-exposure of needles showed pronounced differences between young and mature needles. The large loss of PS2 activity in HI-needles was due to the marked loss of D1 protein of the PS2 reaction centre in mature needles and of the 33 kDa protein in young needles.									11	1	0	0	10	0	12			0300-3604	1573-9058		WOS:000223758900014

Considering the synergistic effect of band gap engineered mixed metal oxide CoSnO3 and good conductivity of reduced graphene oxide (rGO), we report a novel integrated CoSnO3-rGO nanocomposite towards light emitting diode (LED) induced photoelectrocatalytic water splitting. The surface decorated quantum sized CoSnO3-rGO nanoheterojunction has been synthesized using simple hydrothermal technique and characterized using sophisticated analytical instruments. The photoelectrocatalytic activity was evaluated with linear sweep voltammetry and Controlled potential electrolysis. The CoSnO3-rGO nanocomposite catalyst showed excellent photoelectrocatalytic activity towards water oxidation under neutral condition with a low overpotential of similar to 340 mV at 1.0 mAcm(-2) with Tafel slope of 68 mV per decade. The catalyst exhibited good oxygen evolutionwith Faradic efficiency (86%), good structural stability and reproducible response over six days of operation with two days interval.The band gap engineered mixedmetal oxide nanocomposite have been found to harvest thewhite LED light effectively and hybridization with electron acceptor rGO further increased the lifetime of charge carriers thereby increasing the photoelectrocatalytic performance.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			1572-6657	1873-2569		WOS:000639615600009		
J	Boussac, Alain; Sugiura, Miwa; Rappaport, Fabrice					Rappaport, Fabrice/0000-0001-9377-4934			Probing the quinone binding site of Photosystem II from Thermosynechococcus elongatus containing either PsbA1 or PsbA3 as the D1 protein through the binding characteristics of herbicides								BIOCHIMICA ET BIOPHYSICA ACTA-BIOENERGETICS				1807	1			119	129		10.1016/j.bbabio.2010.10.004				JAN 2011	2011	The main cofactors involved in Photosystem II (PSII) oxygen evolution activity are borne by two proteins, D1 (PsbA) and D2 (PsbD). In Thermosynechococcus elongatus, a thermophilic cyanobacterium, the D1 protein is predominantly encoded by either the psbA(1) or the psbA(3) gene, the expression of which depends on the environmental conditions. In this work, the Q(B) site properties in PsbA1-PSII and PsbA3-PSII were probed through the binding properties of DCMU, a urea-type herbicide, and bromoxynil, a phenolic-type herbicide. This was done by using helium temperature EPR spectroscopy and by monitoring the time-resolved changes of the redox state of Q(A) by absorption spectroscopy in PSII purified from a His(6)-tagged WT strain expressing PsbA1 or from a His(6)-tagged strain in which both the psbA(1) and psbA(2) genes have been deleted and which therefore only express PsbA3. It is shown that, in both PsbA1-PSII and PsbA3-PSII, bromoxynil does not bind to PSII when Q(B) is in its semiquinone state which indicates a much lower affinity for PSII when Q(A) is in its semiquinone state than when it is in its oxidized state. This is consistent with the midpoint potential of Q(A)(center dot-)/Q(A) being more negative in the presence of bromoxynil than in its absence [Krieger-Liszkay and Rutherford, Biochemistry 37 (1998) 17339-17344]. The addition in the dark of DCMU, but not that of bromoxynil, to PSII with a secondary electron acceptor in the Q(B)(center dot-) state induces the oxidation of the non-heme iron in a fraction of PsbA3-PSII but not in PsbA1-PSII. These results are explained as follows: i) bromoxynil has a lower affinity for PSII with the non-heme iron oxidized than DCMU therefore, ii) the midpoint potential of the Fe(II)/Fe(III) couple is lower with DCMU bound than with bromoxynil bound in PsbA3-PSII; and iii) the midpoint potential of the Fe(II)/Fe(III) couple is higher in PsbA1-PSII than in PsbA3-PSII. The observation of DCMU-induced oxidation of the non-heme iron leads us to propose that Q(2), an electron acceptor identified by Joliot and Joliot [FEBS Lett 134 (1981) 155-158], is the non-heme iron.

Here a new type of nitrogen-doped tantalum tungstenate (CsTaWO6) material, which demonstrates excellent visible light absorption and improved photocatalytic activity, is demonstrated. X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns reveal that the defect pyrochlore-type structure of CsTaWO6 remained intact upon nitrogen doping. UV-vis spectra indicate that nitrogen doping in the compound results in a red-shift of the absorption edge from 358 nm to 580 nm, thus offering significantly increased visible light absorption. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) further indicates that [Ta/W]-N bonds were formed by inducing nitrogen to replace a small amount of oxygen in the material, resulting in a compound of CsTaWO6-xNx. The explanation of the experimental results is supported by density functional theory calculations. The density of states (DOS) and the projected DOS after substitutional doping of nitrogen in CsTaWO6 indicated that N-doping reduces the bandgap significantly from 3.8 to 2.3 eV due to N 2p and O 2p orbital mixing. The role of the new N 2p states is also investigated by studying the production of the center dot OH radicals in the visible light region (>420 nm). In CsTaWO6-xNx, the N 2p orbitals are the main contributors to the top of the valence band, causing bandgap narrowing while the bottom of conduction band, due to Ta 4d orbitals, remains almost unchanged. Compared with its undoped counterpart, nitrogen-doped CsTaWO6-xNx exhibits a nearly 100% increase in solar hydrogen production efficiency.									125	6	0	0	8	0	125			1616-301X	1616-3028		WOS:000285723000013

Ingestion of microplastics by biota, including freshwater zooplankton has been well studied, however, despite keystone species in freshwater food webs, the molecular response (e.g. oxidative defense) of zooplankton in response to microplastics is still in its infancy. The thioredoxin (TRx) system has a vital function in cellular antioxidative defense via eliminating the excessive generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Therefore, it is necessary to investigate the effects of thioredoxin reductase (TRxR), due to its triggering the TRx catalysis cascade. The present study identified TRxR in Daphnia magna (Dm-TRxR) for the first time, and found that the full-length cDNA was 1862 bp long, containing an 1821-bp open reading frame. Homologous alignments showed the presence of conserved catalytic domain CVNVGC and the seleocysteine (SeCys) residue (U) located in the N- and C- terminal portions. Subsequently, the expression of Dm-TRxR, together with permease, arginine kinase (AK), was investigated by approach of quantitative real-time PCR after exposure to four (1.25-mu m) polystyrene (PS) microbeads concentrations: 0 (control), 2, 4 and 8 mg L-1 for 10 days. Dm-TRxR, permease and AK mRNA were significantly upregulated after exposure to 2, 4 mg L-1 of PS, but then declined in the presence of 8 mg L-1 PS. The gene expression results suggested that oxidative defense, energy production and substance extra cellular transportation were significantly regulated by microplastic exposure. Collectively, the present study will advance our knowledge regarding the biological effects of microplastic pollution on zooplankton, and builds a foundation for freshwater environmental studies on mechanistic and biochemical responses to microplastics.									14	2	0	0	13	0	16			0166-445X	1879-1514		WOS:000459950500010	30639982

The performance of BiVO4 is limited by charge separation for >70nm films or by light harvesting for <700nm films. To resolve this mismatch, host-guest architectures use thin film coatings on 3D scaffolds. Recombination, however, is exacerbated at the extended host-guest interface. Underlayers are used to limit this recombination with a host-underlayer-guest series. Such underlayers consume precious pore volume where typical SnO2 underlayers are optimized with 65-80nm. In this study, conformal and ultrathin SnO2 underlayers with low defect density are produced by atomic layer deposition (ALD). This shifts the optimized thickness to just 8nm with significantly improved space efficiency. The materials chemistry thus determines the dimension optimization. Lastly, host-guest architectures are shown to have an applied bias photon-to-charge efficiency of 0.71%, a new record for a photoanode absorber prepared by ALD.									10	0	0	0	0	0	10			1864-5631	1864-564X		WOS:000471314900014	30571851

A review of the characterized natural redox proteins with a critical eye for molecular scale measurement of variation and selection related to physiological function shows no statistically significant differences in the protein medium lying between cofactors engaged in physiologically beneficial or detrimental electron transfer. Instead, control of electron tunnelling over long distances relies overwhelmingly on less than 14 angstrom spacing between the cofactors in a chain. Near catalytic clusters, shorter distances (commonly less than 7 angstrom) appear to be selected to generate tunnelling frequencies sufficiently high to scale the barriers of multi-electron, bond-forming/-breaking catalysis at physiological rates. We illustrate this behaviour in a tunnelling network analysis of cytochrome c oxidase. In order to surmount the large, thermally activated, adiabatic barriers in the 5-10 kcal mol(-1) range expected for H+ motion and 02 reduction at the binuclear centre of oxidase on the 10(3)-10(5) s(-1) time-scale of respiration, electron access with a tunnelling frequency of 10(9) or 10(10) s(-1) is required. This is provided by selecting closely placed redox centres, such as haem a (6.9 angstrom) or tyrosine (4.9 angstrom). A corollary is that more distantly placed redox centres, such as Cu-A, cannot rapidly scale the catalytic site barrier, but must send their electrons through more closely placed centres, avoiding direct short circuits that might circumvent proton pumping coupled to haems a to a(3) electron transfer. The selection of distances and energetic barriers directs electron transfer from Cu-A to haem a rather than a(3), without any need for delicate engineering of the protein medium to 'hard wire' electron transfer. Indeed, an examination of a large number of oxidoreductases provides no evidence of such naturally selected wiring of electron tunnelling pathways.

Although the roles of UCP3 gene are well understood in mammals, little is known about it in pigeon (Columba livia). In this study, ten white king pigeons were selected as the research object. The full-length cDNA sequence of UCP3 gene was cloned from spleen by rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) and analyzed using bioinformatics tools. The distribution and expression level of pigeon UCP3 in different tissues were determined by qRT-PCR. The results showed that the full-length of pigeon UCP3 (GenBank No. KU166860.1) cDNA was of 1 413 bp including a 924 bp open reading frame (ORF), 75 bp 5'UTR and 414 bp 3'UTR. The ORF encoded polypeptides of 307 amino acids. Structure prediction showed that there were three mitochondrial carrier motifs in the pigeon UCP3 protein. The deduced amino acid sequence of pigeon UCP3 shared identity of 90%~93% with other birds, 72%~75% with mammals, 70% with Danio rerio, and 69% with Xenopus laevis. The phylogenetic relationship analysis indicated that birds, mammals, fish and amphibians each formed a branch. And in the bird branch, Columba livia was closely related with Anas platyrhynchos. These results were similar to the biological classification of different species. The results of qRT-PCR showed that pigeon UCP3 were expressed in all 6 tissues examined. The UCP3 mRNA expression levels in lung were highest, which were significantly higher than that in other tissues (P<0.05), followed by spleen and kidney, and relative lower expression was detected in muscle and heart, and the lowest expression was found in liver. The results of this work may provide a theoretical basis for the further study of its function in poultry.			解偶联蛋白3(uncoupling protein 3, UCP3)是线粒体内重要的转运蛋白,属于线粒体阴离子转运蛋白超家族的一员.哺乳动物UCP3参与多种生理过程,包括生热作用、活性氧生成、脂类代谢和胰岛素分泌等.目前,关于该基因在鸽(Columba livia)上的研究报道很少.本研究以白羽王鸽为研究对象,利用cDNA末端快速扩增(rapid amplification of cDNA ends, RACE)技术,克隆UCP3基因的全长cDNA序列,运用生物信息学的方法对UCP3蛋白结构域、氨基酸同源性等进行分析;采用qRT-PCR技术检测UCP3基因在28日龄鸽不同组织中的表达情况.RACE结果表明,鸽UCP3基因(GenBank No. KU166860.1)cDNA全长1 413 bp,包含75 bp的5'端非翻译区,414 bp的3'端非翻译区和924 bp的开放阅读框(open reading frame, ORF),共编码307个氨基酸.蛋白结构域分析表明,鸽UCP3蛋白具有3个完整的线粒体载体(mitochondrial carrier, Mito_carr)结构域.序列比对显示,鸽与其他鸟类的UCP3氨基酸序列同源性较高(90%~93%),而与哺乳动物(72%~75%)、斑马鱼(Danio rerio)和爪蟾(Xenopus laevis)的同源性较低分别为70%和69%.构建的系统发生树显示,鸟类、哺乳动物、斑马鱼和两栖类的爪蟾分别形成一个分支,且在鸟类分支中,与鸽的聚类顺序较近的物种为鸭(Anas platyrhynchos),该结果与这些物种在生物学上的分类基本一致.qRT-PCR结果显示,UCP3 mRNA所检测的白羽王鸽多个组织器官中都有表达,其中以肺组织的表达量为最高,显著高于其他组织(P<0.05),脾脏和肾脏的表达水平次之,肌肉和心脏组织中有少量表达,肝脏中的表达丰度最低.本研究为进一步探讨禽类UCP3基因的生物学功能提供了理论依据.						0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1674-7968			CSCD:6369582

Owing to its precursor selective chemical etching, and unique intrinsic characteristics, the MXene surface properties are further classified into highly chemically active compound, which further produced different surface functional groups i. e., oxygen, fluorine or hydroxyl groups. However, the role of surface functional groups doesn't not only have a significant impact onto its electrochemical and hydrophilic characteristics (i. e., ion adsorption/diffusion), but also imparting a noteworthy effect onto its conductivity, work function, electronic structure and properties. Henceforth, such kind of inherent chemical nature, robust electrochemistry and high hydrophilicity ultimately increasing the MXene application as a most propitious material for overall environment-remediation, electrocatalytic sensors, energy conversion and storage application. Moreover, it is well documented that the role of MXenes in all kinds of research fields is still on a progress stage for their further improvement, which is not sufficiently summarized in literature till now. The present review article is intended to critically discuss the different chemical aptitudes and the diversity of MXenes and its derivates (i. e., hybrid composites) in all aforesaid application with special emphasis onto the improvement of its surface characteristics for the multidimensional application. However, this review article is anticipated to endorse MXenes and its derivates hybrid configuration, which is discussed in detail for emerging environmental decontamination, electrochemical use, and pollutant detection via electrocatalytic sensors, photocatalysis, along with membrane distillation and the adsorption application. Finally, it is expected, that this review article will open up new window for the effective use of MXene in a broad range of environmental remediation, energy conversion and storage application as a novel, robust, multidimensional and more proficient materials.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1527-8999	1528-0691		WOS:000853558000001	36103617

The low atmospheric temperatures encountered at low metallicities compared with the radiative equilibrium values enforced in classical 1D hydrostatic model atmospheres have a profound impact on the OH line strengths. As a consequence, the derived O abundances using 3D models are found to be systematically lower by more than 0.6 dex at [Fe/H] = 3.0 compared with previous 1D analyses, casting doubts on the recent claims for a monotonic increase in [O/Fe] towards lower metallicities. In fact, taken at face value the resulting 3D LTE trend is in rough agreement with the conventional [O/Fe] plateau. Caution must, however, be exercised in view of the remaining assumptions in the 3D calculations. We have verified that the stellar parameters remain essentially unchanged with 3D model atmospheres provided that the infrared flux method (DeltaT(eff) less than or similar to 20 K), Hipparcos parallaxes (Delta log g less than or similar to 0.05) and Fe II lines (Delta [Fe/H] less than or similar to 0.1 dex) are utilised, leaving the 3D O abundances from OH lines largely intact (Delta [O/H] less than or similar to 0.05 dex). Greater concern stems from possible departures from LTE in both the line formation and the molecular equilibrium, which, if present, would increase the derived O abundances again. Non-LTE line formation calculations with 1D model atmospheres suggest no significant steepening of the [O/Fe] trend even if the abundance corrections amount to about 0.2 dex for all investigated stellar parameters. We note, however, that the 3D case may not necessarily be as metallicity-independent. The apparent lack of laboratory or theoretical rate coefficients at the relevant temperatures for the involved molecular reactions unfortunately prevents a quantitative discussion on the possible effects of non-equilibrium chemistry.									126	0	0	0	0	0	126			0004-6361	1432-0746		WOS:000169963800032

Herein, a novel FeCo alloy nanoparticle-embedded nitrogen-doped carbon (FeCo@NC) was synthesized with the aim of tailoring the transition-metal d-band structure toward an improved formaldehyde oxidation activity for the first time. A unique core@shell metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) architecture with a Fe-based Prussian blue analogue core and Co-containing zeolite imidazole framework shell was firstly fabricated. Then, Fe and Co ion alloying was readily achieved owing to the inherent MOF porosity and interionic nonequilibrium diffusion occurring during pyrolysis. High-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy and X-ray absorption fine structure spectra confirm that small FeCo alloys in situ form in FeCo@NC, which exhibits a higher formaldehyde removal efficiency (93%) than the monometallic Fe-based catalyst and a remarkable CO2 selectivity (85%) at room temperature. Density functional theory calculations indicate the number of electrons transferred from the metal core to the outer carbon layer is altered by alloying Fe and Co. More importantly, a downshift in the d-band center relative to the Fermi level occurs from - 0.93 to - 1.04 eV after introducing Co, which could alleviate the adsorption of reaction intermediates and greatly improve the catalytic performance.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			0304-3894	1873-3336		WOS:000719951700006	34736177

Conveniently, hydrogen can be converted back to electricity either via fuel cells or through combustion in gas turbines, or it can be mixed in low concentrations with natural gas or biogas for combustion in existing power plants. The cornerstone of a practical solar fuel production process is a stable, efficient, and scalable photocatalyst (a semiconductor material that accommodates photon absorption, charge carrier generation and transport, and catalytic reactions). Therefore, the quest for suitable photocatalyst materials is an ongoing process.Recently, carbon nitride (CN) has attracted widespread interest as a metal-free, earth-abundant, and highly stable photocatalyst. However, the catalytic efficiency of CN is not satisfactory because of its poor charge transport attributes. There is a direct relation between the photocatalytic efficiency and charge transport because the basic principle of light-promoted overall photodecomposition of water into H-2 and O-2 molecules (or, generally speaking, photoredox reactions) relies on separation and subsequent transfer of excited-state electron-hole pairs to relative redox couples. However, the excited states last for a very short time, typically nanoseconds to microseconds in liquids, and unless they are separated within this time frame, the excited-state electron-hole pairs undergo recombination with release of the captured light energy as heat or photon emission. To utilize light in a form other than heat or emitted photons by avoiding the recombination of excited-state electron-hole pairs, charged excitons must be scavenged before the absorption of subsequent photons to sustain a multielectron photoredox reaction. Otherwise, the extraction of charges becomes more difficult. This imposes a potential efficiency-limiting factor. An enhancement in water to hydrogen conversion efficiency in CN therefore requires the use of precious-metal cocatalysts (e.g., Pt) and sacrificial electron donor/acceptors to facilitate multielectron/multiproton transfers to overcome the high kinetic barriers. The use of Pt and sacrificial agents is not consistent with the notion of low-cost and sustainable hydrogen production from water. CN must overcome this dependence to stand out as a truly scalable photocatalyst. To make progress, the foremost requirement is to attain an in-depth understanding of the fundamental charge transport phenomena needed for the rational design of CN-based photocatalysts.In this Account, therefore, our aim is to provide a synopsis of current understanding and progress regarding charge-transport-related phenomena (e.g., recombination, trapping, transfer of charge carriers, etc.) and to discuss the effects of charge transport in enhancing the apparent quantum yield of hydrogen production in CN. This understanding is necessary to broaden the scope of CN for other catalytic applications, for example, efficient CO, reduction to methanol or methane, fixation of nitrogen to ammonia, and use as an active material in solar cells. We also identify research gaps and issues to be addressed for a more clear elucidation of charge-transport-related phenomena in CN.

The average particle size of the synthetic pure phase HfB2 powders is about 335 nm. The TG curve of pure HfB2 powders exhibits excellent anti-oxidation modification ability for Si-based coating. After the modification of HfB2 phase, the anti-oxidation ability of SiC coating achieved prominent improvement. The initiative mass loss temperature of SiC coating lagged by 41.8%, while the percentage of mass loss and rate in fastest mass-loss zone of the SiC coating lagged by 57.6% and 33.3%, respectively. The generated B2O3 is responsible for the obviously improved oxidation resistance below 1200 degrees C. It compensates the oxidation protection weaknesses of the Si-based ceramic coating in this temperature region. With the fluid of the SiO2 glass layer, the dispersed Hf-oxides were inlaid in it to form the compound Hf-O-Si glass layer. The Hf-oxides heterogeneous phases with ultra-high melting temperature are able to improve the stability of the SiO2 glass layer at ultra-high temperature. It improves the ability of microcracks restriction and reduces the erosion of oxygen to the carbon matrix.									21	2	0	0	0	0	21			0254-0584	1879-3312		WOS:000445980000061

These enzymes require electrons for their activity, and the electrons are supplied by NAD(P) H through a P450 electron donor system, which is generally a cytochrome P450 reductase (CPR). The yeast Xanthophyllomyces dendrorhous has evolved an exclusive P450-CPR system that specializes in the synthesis of astaxanthin, a carotenoid with commercial potential. For this reason, the aim of this work was to identify and characterize other potential P450 genes in the genome of this yeast using a bioinformatic approach.Results: Thirteen potential P450-encoding genes were identified, and the analysis of their deduced proteins allowed them to be classified in ten different families: CYP51, CYP61, CYP5139 (with three members), CYP549A, CYP5491, CYP5492 (with two members), CYP5493, CYP53, CYP5494 and CYP5495. Structural analyses of the X. dendrorhous P450 proteins showed that all of them have a predicted transmembrane region at their N-terminus and have the conserved domains characteristic of the P450s, including the heme-binding region (FxxGxRxCxG); the PER domain, with the characteristic signature for fungi (PxRW); the ExxR motif in the K-helix region and the oxygenbinding domain (OBD) (AGxDTT); also, the characteristic secondary structure elements of all the P450 proteins were identified. The possible functions of these P450s include primary, secondary and xenobiotic metabolism reactions such as sterol biosynthesis, carotenoid synthesis and aromatic compound degradation.Conclusions: The carotenogenic yeast X. dendrorhous has thirteen P450-encoding genes having potential functions in primary, secondary and xenobiotic metabolism reactions, including some genes of great interest for fatty acid hydroxylation and aromatic compound degradation. These findings established a basis for future studies about the role of P450s in the carotenogenic yeast X. dendrorhous and their potential biotechnological applications.									22	0	0	0	17	1	22			1471-2164			WOS:000405889600001	28724407

Arnold was the detection of thermally stimulated light emission from preilluminated photosynthetic material (Arnold and Sherwood (1957) Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 43: 105-114). This phenomenon, called thermoluminescence (TL), is characteristic of a wide range of materials (semiconductors, minerals, inorganic and organic crystals, and complex biological systems such as the photosynthetic apparatus) which share the common ability of storing radiant energy in thermally stabilized trap states.The original discovery of TL in dried chloroplasts later proved to be a phenomenon common to all photosynthetic organisms: photosynthetic bacteria, cyanobacteria, algae and higher plants. Following the pioneering work of Arnold, considerable effort has been devoted to identification and characterization of photosynthetic TL components. This work has firmly established the participation of various redox states of the water-oxidizing complex and the quinone electron accepters of Photosystem II in the generation of photosynthetic glow curves. Since TL characteristics are very sensitive to subtle changes in redox properties of the involved electron transport components, the TL method has become a powerful tool in probing a wide range of PS II redox reactions. In this paper, we will review the impact of Arnold's work in initiating and promoting TL studies in photosynthesis and will cover the most important developments of this field of research until the present day.									117	2	1	0	100	0	121			0166-8595	1573-5079		WOS:A1996VP18700017	24271292

The study includes benthic and planktonic foraminiferal faunas and the stable isotopic composition of one benthic (Uvigerina celtica) and two planktonic (Globigerina bulloides and Globorotalia inflata) foraminiferal species. Sea bottom and surface water temperatures were estimated based on the delta O-18 values of these species and compared with instrumental data. The foraminiferal fauna and the isotope-based temperature record indicate increasing temperatures throughout the last century. The immigration of a new species, Saidovina karreriana to the area around 100 years ago indicates changes in the trophic conditions and water mass properties, which are probably at least partly due to anthropogenic pollution.									10	0	0	0	7	0	10			0959-6836	1477-0911		WOS:000265513100003		
J	Li, Yanting; Liu, Zhifeng; Zhang, Jing; Guo, Zhengang; Xin, Ying; Zhao, Lei								1D/0D WO3/CdS heterojunction photoanodes modified with dual co-catalysts for efficient photoelectrochemical water splitting								JOURNAL OF ALLOYS AND COMPOUNDS				790				493	501		10.1016/j.jallcom.2019.03.178				JUN 25 2019	2019	The semiconductor photoelectrodes with sufficient light absorption, efficient photogenerated carrier separation and fast transport is crucial for photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting. Herein, we firstly report the 1D/0D WO3/CdS heterojunction photoanodes modified with dual co-catalysts NiOOH and Co-Pi to realize efficient water splitting. In this quaternary photoanode, the heterojunctions restrain the recombination of photo-generated electron-hole pairs and CdS acts as a light absorber for sufficient light absorption. Besides, the amorphous dual-layer co-catalyst NiOOH (the hole storage layer) and Co-Pi (hole transfer layer) can collect and delivery the holes to the Helmholtz layer, respectively. The photoanode yields 6.4 times improved photocurrent density (2.59 mA/cm(2) at 1.0 V vs RHE) in comparison with that of bare WO3 and a 300 mV negatively shifts in onset potential. Moreover, it exhibits high efficiency and persistent stability. These results reveal that heterojunctions and the synergetic effect of the dual-layer co-catalyst could effectively improve the performance for water splitting. Especially, it provides a superior way to design photoelectrodes towards PEC application. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

One-zone ignition and spherical shock ignition of detonations								ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL				641	2			1071	1086		10.1086/500638				APR 20 2006	2006	The details of ignition of Type Ia supernovae remain fuzzy, despite the importance of this input for any large-scale model of the final explosion. Here, we begin a process of understanding the ignition of these hot spots by examining the burning of one zone of material, and then we investigate the ignition of a detonation due to rapid heating at single point. We numerically measure the ignition delay time for onset of burning in mixtures of degenerate material and provide fitting formulae for conditions of relevance in the Type Ia problem. Using the neon abundance as a proxy for the white dwarf progenitor's metallicity, we then find that ignition times can decrease by similar to 20% with the addition of even 5% of neon by mass. When temperature fluctuations that successfully kindle a region are very rare, such a reduction in ignition time can increase the probability of ignition by orders of magnitude. If the neon comes largely at the expense of carbon, a similar decrease in the ignition time can occur. We then consider the ignition of a detonation by an explosive energy input in one localized zone, for example, a Sedov blast wave leading to a shock-ignited detonation. Building on previous work on curved detonations, we confirm that surprisingly large inputs of energy are required to successfully launch a detonation, leading to required match heads of approximate to 4500 detonation thicknesses - tens of centimeters to hundreds of meters - which is orders of magnitude larger than naive considerations might suggest. This is a very difficult constraint to meet for some pictures of a deflagration-to-detonation transition, such as a Zel'dovich gradient mechanism ignition in the distributed burning regime.									24	1	0	0	0	0	24			0004-637X	1538-4357		WOS:000236819400039		
J	Bertamini, M; Nedunchezhian, N								Photoinhibition of photosynthesis in mature and young leaves of grapevine (Vitis vinifera L.)								PLANT SCIENCE				164	4			635	644		10.1016/S0168-9452(03)00018-9				APR 2003	2003	Photoinhibition of photosynthesis was studied in young (fully expanded) and mature sun leaves of grapevine (Vitis vinifera L.), under controlled conditions (irradiation of detached leaves to about 1900 muE m(-2) s(-1)). The degree of photoinhibition was determined by means of the ratio of variable to maximum chlorophyll (Chl) fluorescence (Fv/Fm) and electron transport measurements. Compared with the mature leaves, the young leaves, containing about half the amount of Chl a+b per unit area, exhibited a higher proportion of total carotenoids as xanthophyll cycle pigments and had an increased ratio of total carotenoids to Chl a+b. The potential efficiency of PS II, Fv/Fm, markedly declined in high light irradiated young leaves without significant increase of Fo level. In contrast, Fv/Fm ratio declined with significant increase of Fo level in mature leaves. When various photosynthetic activities were followed on isolated thylakoids, the rate of whole chain and PS II activity were markedly decreased in high light irradiated young leaves than mature leaves. A smaller inhibition of PS I activity was also observed in both leaves. In the subsequent dark incubation, fast recovery was observed in both leaves and reached maximum PSII efficiencies similar to those observed in non-photoinhibited leaves. The artificial exogenous electron donors DPC, NH2OH and Mn2+ failed to restore the high light induced loss of PS II activity in mature leaves, while DPC and NH2OH significantly restored in young leaves. It is concluded that high light inactivates on the donor side of PS II and acceptor side of PS II in young and mature leaves, respectively. Quantification of the PS II reaction center protein D1 and 33 kDa protein of water splitting complex following high light exposure of leaves showed pronounced differences between young and mature leaves. The marked loss of PS II activity in high light irradiated leaves was due to the marked loss of D1 protein of the PS II reaction center and 33 kDa protein of the water splitting complex in mature and young leaves, respectively.

This study developed a facile method to construct a ternary graphitic carbon nitride/zinc tetracarboxyphthalocyanine/graphene quantum dots (g-C3N4/ZnTcPc/GQDs) composite photocatalyst. Graphene quantum dots (GQDs) were used to modify g-C3N4/ZnTcPc through hydrothermal method, where g-C3N4/ZnTcPc was fabricated by immobilizing zinc tetracarboxyphthalocyanine (ZnTcPc) onto g-C3N4 covalently via amido bonds. The photocatalyst was characterized by transmission electron microscopy, ultraviolet-visible diffuse reflectance spectrum, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. The g-C3N4/ZnTcPc/0.1GQDs composites presented an increased photocatalytic activity by using Rhodamine B, sulfaquinoxaline sodium and carbamazepine as the model pollutants under solar light irradiation. ZnTcPc bonding on the g-C3N4 broadens its visible-light spectral response, and GQDs promotes the photogenerated electron-hole-pair separation efficiency because of its efficient electrons-transfer property. Experiments confirmed that superoxide radicals, photogenerated holes and singlet oxygen are the primary active species. The photocatalytic degradation pathway of Rhodamine B, sulfaquinoxaline sodium and carbamazepine was proposed on the basis of ultra-performance liquid chromatography and high-definition mass spectrometry.									77	6	0	0	20	0	77			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000457952600010

Photo-anodes annealed at different temperatures were characterised using photo-electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, cyclic voltammetry in the presence and absence of a hole scavenger and also the open circuit potential under high intensity illumination. Mott-Schottky analysis was used cautiously to estimate the charge carrier concentration and the flat band potential. In addition to overpotential/current distribution and ohmic potential losses, the model also accounts for absorbed photon flux, surface and bulk electron-hole recombination rates, gas desorption, bubble formation and (H-2-O-2) cross-over losses. This allows the model to estimate the total yield of hydrogen, charge and gas collection efficiencies. A methodology is presented here in order to evaluate the parameters required to assess the performance of a photo-electrochemical reactor in 1D and 2D geometries. The importance of taking into account bubble generation and gas desorption is discussed, together with the difficulties of measuring charge carrier concentration and electron-hole recombination in the bulk of the semiconductor, which are of major importance in the prediction of photocurrent densities.									12	0	0	0	0	0	12			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000414605900030

However, three principal factors including noble metal-based electrodes, expensive photovoltaic cell, and concentrated solar light systems largely limited the large-scale practicable implementation of this strategy. In this work, CoNi layered-double-hydroxide (LDH) nanosheets arrays, CoFe2O4 nanoparticles and CoNi LDH/CoFe2O4 composite electrodes are controllably synthesized on Ni foam, Fe foam and NiFe alloy foam, respectively, via a facile hydrothermal process. Experiments and density-functional theory calculation results demonstrate that CoFe2O4 and CoFe2O4/CoNi LDH electrodes are suitable to be used as highly efficient, stable, and freestanding water-splitting electro anode and cathode, respectively. Significantly, combining with a commercial silicon-based solar cell, the assembled PV-EC water splitting device receives 12.7% STH under natural sunlight irradiation. This work provides a typical demonstration and valuable guidelines for practical large-scale solar-to-hydrogen generation using an inexpensive PV-EC technology.									1	1	0	0	0	0	2			0378-7753	1873-2755		WOS:000799565700002

To solve these problems, we develop an efficient method to fabricate a hybrid of Fe3C@N, S co-doped carbon nanotubes coated porous carbon as a superior catalyst towards ORR. The resulted Fe-N-S/C sample exhibits excellent performance in alkaline solution, with a half-wave potential of 0.89 V, which is 30 mV higher than that of commercial Pt/C. The electron transfer number is 3.9 at 0.4 V, indicating a direct four-electron (4e(-)) pathway towards ORR, and the kinetic current density J(k) is 7.96 mA cm(-2) at 0.88 V. After 5000 repeated potential cycling test, only 4 mV of down-shift in its half-wave potential was detected, which manifested the remarkable stability of Fe-N-S/C. The electrochemical performance is attributed to the ordered porous structure, high content of active N-species and the synergistic effect between Fe3C group and S dopants.

In this study, the complete open-reading frame for sea bass GLUT2 was isolated and deposited in the GenBank. The predicted 12 transmembrane domains of the protein (508 amino acids) are presented. A phylogenetic tree was constructed on GLUT2 sequences of sea bass and those of other teleost, amphibian, avian, and mammalian species. We also analyzed acute and chronic hypoxia-induced changes in the expression of hepatic GLUT2 mRNA, using one-tube, two-temperature, real-time RT-PCR with which gene expression can be absolutely quantified by the standard curve method. The number of GLUT-2 mRNA copies was significantly increased in response to both acute (1.9 mg/L, dissolved oxygen for 4 h) and chronic (4.3 mg/L, DO for 15 days) hypoxia conditions. The hypoxia-related changes in GLUT-2 mRNA copy number support the view that GLUT2 is involved in the adaptation response to hypoxia in sea bass, a marine hypoxia-sensitive species. We realize that the GLUT2 mRNA levels in our study do not measure the physiological effects produced by the protein. Thus, we can only speculate that, under hypoxic conditions, GLUT2 probably functions to allow the glucose produced from liver glycogen to leave the hepatocytes. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc.

CS 29497-030: Evidence for operation of the s-process at very low metallicity								ASTRONOMY & ASTROPHYSICS				413	3			1073	U65		10.1051/0004-6361:20031590				JAN 2004	2004	We present an abundance analysis of the very metal-poor, carbon-enhanced star CS 29497 - 030. Our results indicate that this unusually hot turnoff star (T-eff = 6650 K, log g = 3.5) has a metallicity [Fe/H] = - 2.8, and exhibits large overabundances of carbon ([C/Fe] = + 2.38), nitrogen ([N/Fe] = + 1.88), and oxygen ([O/Fe] = + 1.67). This star also exhibits a large enhancement in its neutron-capture elements; the pattern follows that expected to arise from the s-process. In particular, the Pb abundance is found to be very high with respect to iron ([Pb/Fe] = + 3.5), and also with respect to the second peak s-process elements (e.g., Ba, La, Ce, Nd), which fits into the newly introduced classification of lead (Pb) stars. The known spectroscopic binary status of this star, along with the observed s-process abundance pattern, suggest that it has accreted matter from a companion, which formerly was an Asymptotic Giant-Branch (AGB) star. In a preliminary analysis, we have also identified broad absorption lines of metallic species that suggest a large axial rotational velocity for this star, which may be the result of spin-up associated with the accretion of material from its previous AGB companion. In addition, this star is clearly depleted in the light element Li. When considered along with its rather high inferred temperature, these observations are consistent with the expected properties of a very low metallicity halo blue straggler.									103	1	0	0	0	0	104			1432-0746			WOS:000187887900031

In this study, lignite cokes (LCs) prepared by one-step low, medium, and high temperature pyrolysis were used for the removal of four anionic azo dyes. The adsorption efficiency of LCs increased when heated to a temperature higher than 700 degrees C for a period of time longer than 5 min; this improvement in the adsorption efficiency weakened for temperature higher than 700 degrees C. The heating of LCs for 5 min was commonly adopted for industrial adsorbents preparation, which considered both processing costs and the adsorption efficiency. The LC treatment at 700 degrees C for 5 min (LC-700-5) could remove more than 95% of Congo red (CR), methyl orange (MO), and direct fast blue B2RL (DB) dye. Excellent dye removal efficiency was observed for LC-900-5, in which more than 99% of CR, MO, and DB and 89.8% of direct yellow brown D3G were removed. The oxygen-containing groups of LCs decomposed, and its micropores and macropores were substantially developed to form a honeycomb porous structure with a significantly larger surface area. The combination of hydrophobic adsorption, large surface area, and rich macropores and micropores contributed to the high adsorption performance of LCs obtained at high temperatures. Therefore, LCs obtained by one-step short-time medium or high-temperature pyrolysis in this study could be used as effective adsorbents for dyes, which demonstrated potentially significant environmental, social, and economic benefits.									13	0	0	0	3	0	13			0016-2361	1873-7153		WOS:000514171800004

Electrodes based on metallic active sites dispersed in carbon matrices have been shown to be an attractive way to attain this goal. However, challenges remain to prevent catalyst agglomeration that otherwise can result in a decrease of performance over time.In this work, we report an alternative and efficient method to produce nickel-nickel oxide nanoparticles-embedded in carbon nanofibers (Ni-NiO/C), by the solution blow spinning (SBS) process. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analyses show the carbon nanofibrillar matrix as a robust support, with well-dispersed nickel nanoparticles on the surface. The responses of the linear scanning voltammetry, cyclic voltammetry and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy demonstrate how a small fraction of nickel on the fiber surface (approximate to 1.2-5.3%) is enough to promote substantial improvement in performance (eta = 278 and 309 mV vs RHE for 10 mA cm(-2)) and a significant turnover frequency (TOP) values of 1.38 (II = 278) and 1.30 s(-1) (eta = 309). These promising results are correlated with a large amount of Ni3+ present on the fiber surfaces, as identified by X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS). This work provides a low-cost and rapid preparation technique that can be extended for the manufacture of a wide variety of electrodes based on metals supported on carbon nanofibers.

J	Gunjakar, Jayavant L.; Kim, In Young; Lee, Jang Mee; Lee, Nam-Suk; Hwang, Seong-Ju					Lee, Jangmee/0000-0003-4817-6905			Self-assembly of layered double hydroxide 2D nanoplates with graphene nanosheets: an effective way to improve the photocatalytic activity of 2D nanostructured materials for visible light-induced O-2 generation								ENERGY & ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE				6	3			1008	1017		10.1039/c3ee23989f				MAR 2013	2013	Highly efficient photocatalysts for visible light-induced O-2 generation are synthesized via an electrostatically derived self-assembly of Zn-Cr-LDH 2D nanoplates with graphene 2D nanosheets. In the obtained nanohybrids, the positively charged Zn-Cr-LDH nanoplates are immobilized on the surface of negatively charged graphene nanosheets with the formation of a highly porous stacked structure. A strong electronic coupling of the subnanometer-thick Zn-Cr-LDH nanoplates with reduced graphene oxide (RGO)/graphene oxide (GO) nanosheets gives rise not only to the prominent increase of visible light absorption but also to a remarkable depression of the photoluminescence signal. The self-assembled Zn-Cr-LDH-RGO nanohybrids display an unusually high photocatalytic activity for visible light-induced O-2 generation with a rate of similar to 1.20 mmol h(-1) g(-1), which is far superior to that of the pristine Zn-Cr-LDH material (similar to 0.67 mmol h(-1) g(-1)). The fact that pristine Zn-Cr-LDH is one of the most effective visible light photocatalysts for O-2 production with unusually high quantum efficiency of 61% at lambda = 410 nm highlights the excellent functionality of the Zn-Cr-LDH-RGO nanohybrids as visible light active photocatalysts. The Zn-Cr-LDH-RGO nanohybrid shows a higher photocatalytic activity than the Zn-Cr-LDH-GO nanohybrid, providing strong evidence for the superior advantage of the hybridization with RGO. The present findings clearly demonstrate that graphene nanosheets can be used as an effective platform for improving the photocatalytic activity of 2D nanostructured inorganic solids.									190	7	0	0	13	0	191			1754-5692	1754-5706		WOS:000315165700037

Films were characterized by X-ray diffractometry, scanning electron microscopy, atomic force microscopy, UV-visible spectrometry, energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and transmission electron microscopy. Significant gain in photocurrent and applied bias photon-to-current efficiency, with 3% Cu incorporated BNHS films yielding maximum photocurrent similar to 2.98 mA cm(-2), is attributable to favourable changes in material microstructure and electrical properties. CuO nanparticles existing as dispersed phase in ZnO overlayer and tendering a possible mechanism for the transfer of photogenerated holes from the underneath CuO layer to electrolyte is a highlighting proposition of this report.[GRAPHICS].									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			0021-891X	1572-8838		WOS:000539528500001

Prepared nanocomposites were confirmed by X-ray diffraction spectra (XRD) by obtaining strong diffraction correspond to rhombohedral and orthorhombic phase of NiS and FeS2 respectively. A well defined Raman active mode of vibrations obtained around 337, 477 and 543 cm(-1) revealed for NiS@FeS2 nanocomposites. Metal sulphide vibrations such as Ni-S and Fe-S were confirmed by Fourier transform infrared spectra (FTIR). The morphological determination and the tiny particles combination was revealed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) studies. The superior performance of NiS@FeS2 nanocomposites towards electrochemical water oxidation has been observed from cyclic voltammogram (CV) and linear sweep volttammogram (LSV) results. The higher current density of 399 mA/g was achieved for the optimized NiS@FeS2 nanocomposites at 10 mV/s scan rate with very low Tafel slope value of 63 mV/dec. Furthermore, 12 h of long lasting stability around 120% was achieved for the same electrode for superior electrochemical water oxidation. The observed results strongly recommended that the controlled synthesis of NiS@FeS2 nanocomposites coated Ni foam substrate could be acted as an efficient working electrode for superior water oxidation process for sustainable electrochemical water splitting potential applications.									14	0	0	0	1	0	14			1369-8001	1873-4081		WOS:000472507900022

For a better understanding of clean and efficient resource utilization of WWPs, this study comprehensively provides a state-of-the-art overview of their selective pyrolysis in terms of pyrolysis mechanisms, formation characteristics and properties of pyrolysis products. It was noted that WWPs displayed a dual characteristic of excellent fuel quality and high fuel-N content due to co-existence of abundant lignocellulosic components and adhesives (referring to urea-formaldehyde resin, UFR). Pyrolysis of WWPs was intrinsically regarded as the interactions between lignocellulosic components and UFR under oxygen-free thermal conditions, leading to distinctive properties of pyrolysis products, especially referring to N-containing species. For pyrolytic gas, they were environmentally harmful but formed selectively to pyrolysis temperature. Subsequently, thermal pre-treatment at low temperatures was capable to favor their clean thermal utilization by reducing or regulating original fuel-N in WWPs. On the contrary, N-containing species in bio-oil and activated carbon were both economically valuable. Specifically, nitrogen compounds in bio-oil could manifest its excellent anti-bacterial/fungicidal and high value-added properties; nitrogen functionalities in activated carbon could guarantee its better adsorption capability and electrochemical performance. Hence, based on a new concept of role change of fuel-N from harmful to valuable species, by promoting its preferential conversion into solid/liquid phases, poly-generation of N-poor pyrolytic gas, N-enriched bio-oil and N-doped activated carbon from selective pyrolysis would be a promising technique for clean and efficient utilization of WWPs.									32	1	0	0	7	0	33			0016-2361	1873-7153		WOS:000471841600118

During this photoacclimation process, photosystem II (PSII), the water:plastoquinone photooxidoreductase involved in oxygenic photosynthesis, is modified. The resulting FRL-PSII is comprised of FRL-specific core subunits and binds chlorophyll (Chl) d and Chl f molecules in place of several of the Chl a molecules found when cells are grown in visible light. These new Chls effectively lower the energy canonically thought to define the "red limit" for light required to drive photochemical catalysis of water oxidation. Changes to the architecture of FRL-PSII were previously unknown, and the positions of Chl d and Chl f molecules had only been proposed from indirect evidence. Here, we describe the 2.25 angstrom resolution cryo-EM structure of a monomeric FRL-PSII core complex from Synechococcus sp. PCC 7335 cells that were acclimated to FRL. We identify one Chl d molecule in the Chl(D1) position of the electron transfer chain and four Chl f molecules in the core antenna. We also make observations that enhance our understanding of PSII biogenesis, especially on the acceptor side of the complex where a bicarbonate molecule is replaced by a glutamate side chain in the absence of the assembly factor Psb28. In conclusion, these results provide a structural basis for the lower energy limit required to drive water oxidation, which is the gateway for most solar energy utilization on earth.									11	0	0	0	7	0	11				1083-351X		WOS:000748384500012	34801554

Our previous study revealed that Litopenaeus vannamei Notch (LvNotch) was involved in immune response by regulating reactive oxygen species (ROS) production in hemocytes. However, the immune regulatory networks mediated by LvNotch remain unclear in shrimp. In this study, 21 proteins that potentially interact with LvNotch were identified by GST pull-down and liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) analyses. Among these proteins, COP9 signalosome complex subunit 1 (CSN1) was chosen for further studies due to its putative role in immune response. The interaction between LvNotch and LvCSN1 was confirmed by Far-Western blot and GST pull-down analyses. In vivo knockdown of LvNotch resulted in an increase in LvCSN1 expression in hemocytes, which suggest that the COP9 signalosome complex might be negatively regulated by LvNotch. In addition, in vivo silencing of LvNotch upregulated the expression of LvDorsal, LvTNFSF and LvCrustin2 (NF-kappa B pathway related-genes), while their expression decreased after LvCSN1 depletion. Collectively, the current results indicate that LvNotch negatively regulates the NF-kappa B pathway by modulating LvCSN1 in shrimp.Significance: Although the Notch signaling pathway has been implicated in the regulation of immune response in vertebrates and invertebrates, the functions and immune-related interacting networks of Notch in shrimp immune response remain unknown. In this study, twenty-one proteins including COP9 signalosome complex subunit 1 (CSN1) were identified as potential interacting partners of LvNotch. Further analysis revealed that LvNotch negatively regulates the NF-kappa B pathway by binding to CSN1 and modulating its expression. These findings for the first time suggest that the Notch signaling pathway has cross-talk with the NF-kappa B pathway in shrimp as part of the immune response.									4	0	0	0	3	0	4			1874-3919	1876-7737		WOS:000606630200001	33309928

INDIAN JOURNAL OF MEDICAL RESEARCH				131	4			565	570						APR 2010	2010	Background & objectives: Periplasmic copper and zinc superoxide dismutase (Cu,Zn-SOD or SodC) is an important component of the antioxidant shield which protects bacteria from the phagocytic oxidative burst. Cu,Zn-SODs protect Gram-negative bacteria against oxygen damage which have also been shown to contribute to the pathogenicity of these bacterial species. We report the presence of SodC in drug resistant Salmonella sp. isolated from patients suffering from enteric fever. Further sodC was amplified, cloned into Escherichia coli and the nucleotide sequence and amino acid sequence homology were compared with the standard strain Salmonella Typhimurium 14028.Methods: Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi (S. Typhi) and Salmonella enterica serovar Paratyphi (S. Paratyphi) were isolated and identified from blood samples of the patients. The isolates were screened for the presence of Cu, Zn-SOD by PAGE using KCN as inhibitor of Cu,Zn-SOD. The gene (sodC) was amplified by PCR, cloned and sequenced. The nucleotide and amino acid sequences of sodC were compared using CLUSTAL X.Results: SodC was detected in 35 per cent of the Salmonella isolates. Amplification of the genomic DNA of S. Typhi and S. Paratyphi with sodC specific primers resulted in 519 and 515 bp amplicons respectively. Single mutational difference at position 489 was observed between the sodC of S. Typhi and S. Paratyphi while they differed at 6 positions with the sodC of S. Typhimurium 14028. The SodC amino acid sequences of the two isolates were homologous but 3 amino acid difference was observed with that of standard strain S. Typhimurium 14028.Interpretation & conclusions: The presence of SodC in pathogenic bacteria could be a novel candidate as phylogenetic marker.									6	0	0	0	6	0	6			0971-5916			WOS:000276887300015	20424309	
J	Delrieu, MJ								Regulation of thermal dissipation of absorbed excitation energy and violaxanthin deepoxidation in the thylakoids of Lactuca sativa. Photoprotective mechanism of a population of photosystem II centers								BIOCHIMICA ET BIOPHYSICA ACTA-BIOENERGETICS				1363	2			157	173		10.1016/S0005-2728(97)00097-2				FEB 25 1998	1998	Non-photochemical quenching of chlorophyll a fluorescence is thought to be mainly associated with thermal dissipation of excitation energy taking place within the antenna and reaction center of PS II. In this report, non-photochemical fluorescence quenching was investigated in the fluorescence yields induced by a series of short and high-energy flashes after dark adaptation. The observation of period four fluorescence oscillations with increasing flash number indicates functioning O-2 evolving centers. It was found that these PS II centers could not be identical to all the O-2 evolving centers. Appreciable differences in antenna size and the number of centers were observed between the PS II centers contributing to fluorescence oscillations and the PS II centers that evolve the flash-induced steady-state O-2 yield. Direct evidence for non-photochemical fluorescence quenching was provided by the numerical fitting of the fluorescence oscillations. This procedure revealed that a proportion of the centers exhibiting oscillating fluorescence yields, converted into quenching centers after each flash of a series (7% in February; 17% in June). The observed quenching could not be related to a dissipative process inside the reaction center. Instead, it was attributed to a change in the organization of some PS II centers in the membrane, possibly a conversion of PS Il dimers into PS II monomers, resulting in a decreased absorption cross-section for these centers. Quenching resulting from energy de-excitation in the antenna was also observed. This was a light-initiated process, but the modification of the antenna occurred in the dark on a time scale of a few minutes. After this dark period and only on the first flash of a series, antenna quenching was revealed by a smaller absorption cross-section of the PS II centers involved in fluorescence oscillations. This process was reversed on the following flashes. The same period of darkness after illumination was necessary to allow maximum zeaxanthin formation to occur in the dark at a higher pH than the pH for optimum violaxanthin deepoxidation in the absence of preillumination. To explain this effect, comparable to that referred to as light activation for non-photochemical quenching (Ruban and Horton, Aust. J. Plant Physiol. 22 (1995) 221-230), we propose that upon preillumination (before darkness), the protons released in response to a net positive charge in these PS II centers, have access to proton binding groups acting in a cooperative way in LHC II. This accounts for the proton cooperativity as can be deduced from the pH dependence of the rate constant of violaxanthin deepoxidation (Hill coefficient n from 2 to 6).

RhOx-IrO2 was prepared from chloride precursors of Rh and Ir. for surface studies. These metal oxides were then immobilised on solid Ti substrates via dip withdrawal coating methods to form thin films. The Ti/RhOx-IrO2 thin films were extensively characterized in terms of surface characterization and chemical composition and used in the oxidation of phenol. Thermo-gravimetric analysis (TGA) determined the calcination temperature at 700 degrees C where no further structural changes occurred due to mass loss. The rhodium oxide showed two-phase formations, RhO2 and Rh2O3, which were attributed to high calcinated temperatures compare to one phase IrO2 which was stable at lower temperatures. The scanning electron microscopy (SEM) showed that the morphology of the film was found to be rough with a grain-like appearance in the 150-nm range. The phase composition of these metal oxides was determined by X-ray diffraction (XRD) technique and found to have crystalline structures. The results obtained from Rutherford backscattering spectrometry (RBS) revealed information regarding the chemical composition of the metal oxides and confirmed the diffusion of Rh and It into the Ti substrate. Electrochemical characterization of the Ti/RhOx-IrO2 electrode, via cyclic voltammetry (CV), showed distinctive redox peaks: anodic and cathodic peaks associated with the oxidation and reduction of the ferricyanide-ferrocyanide couple was seen at 250 and 100 mV respectively: the peak observed at 1000 mV was associated with oxygen evolution and a broad reductive wave at 600 mV can be ascribed to the Ti/RuOx-IrO2 reduction, which proved that the Ti/RhOx-IrO2 electrode were electroactive and exhibit fast electrochemistry.

The importance of PGC-1 alpha in contractile activity-induced mitochondrial adaptations								AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PHYSIOLOGY-ENDOCRINOLOGY AND METABOLISM				300	2			E361	E371		10.1152/ajpendo.00292.2010				FEB 2011	2011	Uguccioni G, Hood DA. The importance of PGC-1 alpha in contractile activity-induced mitochondrial adaptations. Am J Physiol Endocrinol Metab 300: E361-E371, 2011. First published November 16, 2010; doi: 10.1152/ajpendo.00292.2010.-The transcriptional coactivator PPAR gamma coactivator-1 alpha (PGC-1 alpha) is a critical regulator of mitochondrial content and function in skeletal muscle. PGC-1 alpha may also mediate mitochondrial adaptations in response to chronic contractile activity (CCA). To characterize the essential role of PGC-1 alpha in organelle biogenesis, C2C12 murine myotubes were transfected with PGC-1 alpha-specific siRNA and subjected to electrical stimulation-evoked CCA. CCA enhanced cytochrome c oxidase (COX) activity along with increases in several nuclear-encoded mitochondrial proteins. Transfection of PGC-1 alpha siRNA decreased protein and mRNA of the coactivator by 60%, resulting in decrements of Tfam and COX-IV proteins. The mRNA expression of the PGC-1 family members PGC-1 beta and PRC, as well as transcription factors NRF-1/2 and ERR alpha, did not exhibit compensatory changes in response to PGC-1 alpha depletion. However, phosphorylation of AMPK was enhanced in myotubes with reduced levels of PGC-1 alpha. This suggests the presence of metabolic compensatory stress signals in cells deficient in PGC-1 alpha. Our findings reveal that the CCA-induced increases in COX-IV protein and overall mitochondrial content, using both COX activity and organelle fluorescence, are dependent on PGC-1 alpha. However, this was not the case for all proteins, since decreased levels of the coactivator did not attenuate the increases in Tfam and cytochrome c in response to CCA. These data indicate that PGC-1 alpha is necessary for most of the mitochondrial adaptations that occur with CCA but that there are additional pathways that function in parallel with PGC-1 alpha to mediate the elevated expression of specific nuclear-encoded proteins that are vital for mitochondrial function and cell viability.									51	3	0	0	36	0	54			0193-1849	1522-1555		WOS:000289011600012	21081705	
J	Reinke, P; Oelhafen, P								Photoelectron spectroscopic investigation of the bias-enhanced nucleation of polycrystalline diamond films								PHYSICAL REVIEW B				56	4			2183	2190		10.1103/PhysRevB.56.2183				JUL 15 1997	1997	In the present work we describe an investigation of the nucleation mechanism of polycrystalline diamond films if the bias-enhanced-nucleation (BEN) method is used. Photoelectron spectroscopy with excitation energies in the ultraviolet [ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS)] and x-ray regime (x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy) as well as electron energy loss spectroscopy are employed to monitor the nucleation process and the subsequent diamond film growth. The deposition is performed in situ, thus avoiding surface contamination with oxygen or hydrocarbons. The observation of the temporal evolution of composition and structure of the deposited film and its interface with the underlying silicon substrate allow us to develop a qualitative model, which describes the nucleation process. The BEN pretreatment leads, through the irradiation with low-energy ions, to the codeposition of an amorphous carbon phase and the crystalline diamond phase. The presence of both phases is readily apparent in the UPS analysis, which will prove to be an indispensible tool in the structural characterization of the carbon phase present at the surface. There is no indication for the presence of graphite or large graphitic clusters. A deconvolution of the C 1s and Si 2p core-level peaks does confirm the presence of two carbon phases and the formation of a silicon carbide interface. With increasing deposition time the contribution of diamond to the carbon film increases and upon switching to diamond growth conditions the amorphous carbon phase is rapidly etched and only the diamond crystals remain and continue to grow. This removal of the amorphous phase leads to a decrease in the overall carbon concentration at the surface by 18-30% during the first 30 sec of the diamond growth period and was observed for a variety of pretreatment conditions. A silicon carbide interfacial layer is formed early on during the BEN pretreatment and its thickness is reduced considerably by etching during the diamond growth period.

UGTs catalyze the transfer of sugars to various acceptor molecules including flavonoids. Previously, UGT71C1 was shown to glycosylate the 3-OH of hydroxycinnamates and flavonoids in vitro. Such secondary metabolites are known to play important roles in plant growth and development. To help define the role of UGT71C1 in planta, we investigated its expression patterns, and isolated and characterized a loss-of-function mutation in the UGT71C1 gene (named ugt71c1-1). Our analyses by quantitative real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR), microarray data mining, and histochemical detection of GUS activity driven by the UGT71C1 promoter region, revealed the tissue-specific expression patterns of UGT71C1 with highest expression in roots. Interestingly, upon treatment with methyl viologen (MV, paraquat), ugt71c1-1 plants displayed enhanced resistance to oxidative stress, and ROS scavenging activity was higher than normal. Metabolite profiling revealed that the levels of two major glycosides of quereetin and kaempferol were reduced in ugt71c1-1 plants. In addition, when exposed to W-induced oxidative stress, eight representative ROS response genes were expressed at lower levels in ugt71c1-1 plants, indicating that ugt71c1-1 probably has higher non-enzymatic antioxidant activity. Taken together, our results indicate that ugt71c1-1 has increased resistance to oxidative stress, suggesting that UGT71C1 plays a role in some glycosylation pathways affecting secondary metabolites such as flavonoids in response to oxidative stress.									19	2	0	0	18	0	23			1016-8478			WOS:000256486000006	18443422

Genome-wide selection particularly for adaptation to extreme environments left detectable signatures genome-wide. We used highdensity genotype data for 42 cattle breeds and identified the influence of Bos grunniens and Bos javanicus on the formation of Chinese indicine breeds that led to their divergence from India-origin zebu. We also found evidence for introgression, admixture, and migration in most of the Chinese breeds. Selection signature analyses between high-altitude (>= 1800 m) and low-altitude adapted breeds (<1500 m) revealed candidate genes (ACSS2, ALDOC, EPAS1, EGLN1, NUCB2) and pathways that are putatively involved in hypoxia adaptation. Immunohistochemical, real-time PCR and CRISPR/cas9 ACSS2-knockout analyses suggest that the up-regulation of ACSS2 expression in the liver promotes the metabolic adaptation of cells to hypoxia via the hypoxia-inducible factor pathway. High altitude adaptation involved the introgression of alleles from high-altitude adapted yaks into Chinese Bos taurus taurus prior to their formation into recognized breeds and followed by selection. In addition to selection, adaptation to high altitude environments has been facilitated by admixture and introgression with locally adapted cattle populations.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0888-7543	1089-8646		WOS:000661249800010	33771637

The two investigated treatments (HBr plasma and vacuum ultra violet (VUV) plasma radiation) have been tested on both blanket photoresist films and resist patterns to highlight the etching and roughening mechanisms of cured resists. Both treatments reinforce the etch resistance of the photoresist exposed to fluorocarbon plasma etching process used to open the Si-ARC (silicon antireflective coating) layer. The etch resistance improvement of cured resists is attributed to both the decrease in oxygen content within the resist and the crosslinking phenomena caused by VUV radiation during the treatment. As the magnitude of the surface roughness is directly correlated to the etched thickness, cured resists, which are etched less rapidly, will develop a lower surface roughness for the same processing time compared to reference resists. The LWR evolution along the pattern sidewalls has been studied by critical dimension atomic force microscopy during the Si-ARC plasma etching step. The study shows that the LWR is degraded at the top of the resist pattern and propagates along the pattern sidewalls. However, as long as the degradation does not reach the interface between resist and Si-ARC, the LWR decreases during the Si-ARC etching step. As resist pretreatments reinforce the resist etch resistance during Si-ARC etching, the LWR degradation along the sidewalls is limited leading to minimized LWR transfer. The LWR decrease observed after plasma etching has been explained thanks to a spectral analysis of the LWR performed by critical dimension scanning electron microscopy combined with the power spectral density fitting method. The study shows that the high and medium frequency components of the roughness (periodicity below 200 nm) are not totally transferred during the gate patterning allowing a LWR decrease at each plasma step.

In the present study, the metabolic characteristics of Phrynocephalus erythrurus (Lacertilia: Agamidae), which inhabits high altitudes (4500 m) and Phrynocephalus przewalskii (Lacertilia: Agamidae), which inhabits low altitudes, were analysed to explore the metabolic regulatory strategies for lizards living at high-altitude environments. The results indicated that the mitochondrial respiratory rates of P. erythrurus were significantly lower than those of P. przewalskii, and that proton leak accounts for 74 similar to 79% of state 4 and 7 similar to 8% of state3 in P. erythrurus vs. 43 similar to 48% of state 4 and 24 similar to 26% of state3 in P. przewalskii. Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) activity in P. erythrurus was lower than in P. przewalskii, indicating that at high altitude the former does not, relatively, have a greater reliance on anaerobic metabolism. A higher activity related to beta-hydroxyacyl coenzyme A dehydrogenase (HOAD) and the HOAD/citrate synthase (CS) ratio suggested there was a possible higher utilization of fat in P. erythrurus. The lower expression of PGC-1 alpha and PPAR-gamma in P. erythrurus suggested their expression was not influenced by cold and low PO2 at high altitude. These distinct characteristics of P. erythrurus are considered to be necessary strategies in metabolic regulation for living at high altitude and may effectively compensate for the negative influence of cold and low PO2.									25	8	0	0	24	0	26			1932-6203			WOS:000323109700126	23951275	
J	KLIMOV, V; ANANYEV, G; ZASTRYZHNAYA, O; WYDRZYNSKI, T; RENGER, G				Wydrzynski, Thomas/C-9630-2009				PHOTOPRODUCTION OF HYDROGEN-PEROXIDE IN PHOTOSYSTEM-II MEMBRANE-FRAGMENTS - A COMPARISON OF 4 SIGNALS								PHOTOSYNTHESIS RESEARCH				38	3			409	416		10.1007/BF00046768				DEC 1993	1993	The present study describes the formation of different forms of peroxide in Photosystem II (PS II) by using a chemiluminescence detection technique. Four chemiluminescence signals (A, B, C and D) of the luminol-peroxidase (Lu-Per) system, which detects peroxide, are found in illuminated O-2-evolving Photosystem II (PS II) membrane fragments isolated from spinach. Signal A ('free peroxide') peaking around 0.2-0.3 s after mixing PS II membrane fragments with Lu-Per is eliminated by catalase or removal of oxygen from the suspension and ascribed to O-2 interaction with reduced PS II electron accepters. In contrast, signal B peaking around 1.5 min remains largely unaffected under anaerobic conditions, as well as in the presence of catalase (20 mu L/ml). Under flash illumination the extent of this signal exhibits a weak period four oscillation (maximum at third and 7th flash). Its yield increases up to the third flash, but is close to zero in the fourth flash. An analogous behaviour is observed in flashes 5 to 8. Signal B is ascribed to Lu-Per interaction with the water-oxidizing system being in S-2 and/or S-3-state. Signal C ('bound peroxide') detected as free peroxide after acid decomposition of illuminated PS II particles is observed on the 1 st flash and oscillates with period 2 with superposition of period 4. It is evidently related to peroxide either released from S-2 or formed at S-2 upon acid shock treatment. Signal D ('slowly released peroxide') peaking around 2-3 s after mixing is observed in samples after various treatments (LCC-incubation, washing with 1 M NaCl at pH 8 or with 1 M CaCl2, Cl--depletion) that lead to at least partial removal of the extrinsic proteins of 18, 24 and 33 kDa without Mn extraction. The average amplitude of this signal corresponds with a yield of about 0.2 H2O2 molecules per RC and flash. In a flash train, the extent of signal D exhibits an oscillation pattern with a minimum at the 3rd flash. We assume that these treatments increase the release of 'bound' peroxide (upon injection into the Lu-Per assay) either formed in the normal oxidative pathway of the water oxidase in the S-2 or the S-3-state or give rise to peroxide formation due to higher accessibility of the Mn-cluster to water molecules.									70	0	1	0	59	0	71			0166-8595			WOS:A1993MX41700023	24317997

Clones 52 and 30 under controlled conditions of high irradiation (about 1900 mu mol m(-2) s(-1) for 60 min; HL treatment), followed by 60 min in darkness. The degree of photoinhibition was determined based on the ratio of variable to maximum chlorophyll fluorescence (F, IF), which is a measure of the potential efficiency of photosystem II (PSII), and on electron transport measurements. The F-v/F-m ratio declined in needles of both clones in response to the HL treatment. Minimal fluorescence (F-o) increased in HL-treated needles of both clones. The HL treatment decreased rates of whole-chain and PSII activity of isolated thylakoids more in Clone 52 than in Clone 30. In needles of both clones, PSI activity was less sensitive to photoinhibition than PSII activity. In the subsequent 60-min dark incubation, fast recovery was observed in needles of both clones, with PSII efficiencies reaching similar values to those in non-photoinhibited needles. The artificial exogenous electron donors diphenyl carbazide (DPC), hydroxylamine (NHOH) and manganese chloride (MnCl2) failed to restore the HL-induced loss of PSII activity in needles of Clone 30, whereas DPC and NH2OH significantly restored PSII activity in photoinhibited needles of Clone 52. Quantification of the PSII reaction center protein D1 and the 33-kDa protein of the water-splitting complex following HL treatment of needles revealed pronounced differences between Clone 52 and Clone 30. The large decrease in PSII activity in HL-treated needles was caused by the marked loss of D1 protein and 33-kDa protein in Clone 30 and Clone 52, respectively.									8	0	0	0	6	0	8			0829-318X	1758-4469		WOS:000231208200008	15929934	
J	Havaux, M								Short-term responses of photosystem I to heat stress - Induction of a PS II-independent electron transport through PS I fed by stromal components								PHOTOSYNTHESIS RESEARCH				47	1			85	97		10.1007/BF00017756				JAN 1996	1996	When 23 degrees C-grown potato leaves (Solanum tuberosum L.) were exposed for 15 min to elevated temperatures in weak light, a dramatic and preferential inactivation of Photosystem (PS) II was observed at temperatures higher than about 38 degrees C. In vivo photoacoustic measurements indicated that, concomitantly with the loss of PS II activity, heat stress induced a marked gas-uptake activity both in far-red light (>715 nm) exciting only PS I and in broadband light (350-600 nm) exciting PS I and PS II. In view of its suppression by nitrogen gas and oxygen and its stimulation by high carbon-dioxide concentrations, the bulk of the photoacoustically measured gas uptake by heat-stressed leaves was ascribed to rapid carbon-dioxide solubilization in response to light-modulated stroma alkalization coupled to PS I-driven electron transport. Heat-induced gas uptake was observed to be insensitive to the PS II inhibitor diuron, sensitive to the plastocyanin inhibitor HgCl2 and saturated at a rather high photon flux density of around 1200 mu E m(-2) s(-1). Upon transition from far-red light to darkness, the oxidized reaction center P700(+) of PS I was re-reduced m very slowly in control leaves (with a half time t(1/2) higher than 500 ms), as measured by leaf absorbance changes at around 820 nm. Heat stress caused a spectacular acceleration of the postillumination P700(+) reduction, with t(1/2) falling to a value lower than 50 ms (after leaf exposure to 48 degrees C). The decreased t(1/2) was sensitive to HgCl2 and insensitive to diuron, methyl viologen (an electron acceptor of PS I competing with the endogenous acceptor ferredoxin) and anaerobiosis. This acceleration of the P700(+) reduction was very rapidly induced by heat treatment (within less than 5 min) and persisted even after prolonged irradiation of the leaves with far-red light. After heat stress, the plastoquinone pool exhibited reduction in darkness as indicated by the increase in the apparent Fo level of chlorophyll fluorescence which could be quenched by far-red light. Application (for 1 min) of far-red light to heat-pretreated leaves also induced a reversible quenching of the maximal fluorescence level Fm, suggesting formation of a pH gradient in far-red light. Taken together, the presented data indicate that PS I responded to the heat-induced loss of PS II photochemical activity by catalyzing an electron flow from stromal reductants. Heat-stress-induced PS I electron transport independent of PS II seems to constitute a protective mechanism since block of this electron pathway in anaerobiosis was observed to result in a dramatic photoinactivation of PS I.									187	27	5	0	175	0	220			0166-8595	1573-5079		WOS:A1996UE16800009	24301710

In this study, the CuZnSOD homolog from redlip mullet (Liza haematochelia) (MuCuZnSOD) was structurally and functionally characterized to evaluate its antioxidant capacity, antibacterial properties, and protective level in various pathogenic stress conditions. Structural characteristics of MuCuZnSOD were evaluated using different bioinformatics tools. Pairwise sequence comparison and evolutionary tree structure revealed that the MuCuZnSOD sequence was closely related to the CuZnSOD sequence of Oplegnathus fasciatus with a 94.2% sequence identity. Sequence alignment analysis indicated that the CuZnSOD domain was well conserved. The highest transcriptional expression of MuCuZnSOD was identified in the blood. Immune challenge with lipopolysaccharide (LPS), Lactococcus garvieae, and polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid (poly I:C) exhibited an increased MuCuZnSOD mRNA expression in the blood and liver. Transfected green fluorescent protein-fused MuCuZnSOD was localized in the cytoplasm. Recombinant MuCuZnSOD (rMuCuZnSOD) was overexpressed in a bacterial system. The rMuCuZnSOD possessed significant antioxidant properties as determined by conventional xanthine oxidase assay. The optimum pH and temperature of rMuCuZnSOD were found to be pH 9 and 25 degrees C, respectively. rMuCuZnSOD enzyme activity increased in a concentration-dependent manner. Treatment with potassium cyanide highly inhibited the rMuCuZnSOD activity. rMuCuZnSOD possessed a significant peroxidation activity in the presence of HCO3- ions as demonstrated by the increased viability in cells treated with the enzyme in the presence of hydrogen peroxide. Antibacterial assays showed that rMuCuZnSOD had significant growth-inhibitory effects on both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. Collectively, our findings demonstrate that MuCuZnSOD is an essential antioxidant protein, which regulates the host defense mechanisms and innate immunity under oxidative stress.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0145-305X	1879-0089		WOS:000672561200005	34116115

This resulted in discriminations (Delta) of 27.4 +/- 0.9 parts per thousand for wild-type tobacco Rubisco, 22.2 +/- 2.1 parts per thousand for Rhodospirillum rubrum Rubisco, and 11.2 +/- 1.6 parts per thousand for a large subunit mutant of tobacco Rubisco in which Leu(335) is mutated to valine (L335V). These Delta values are consistent with the photosynthetic discrimination determined for wild-type tobacco and transplastomic tobacco lines that exclusively produce R. rubrum or L335V Rubisco. The Delta values are indicative of the potential evolutionary variability of Delta values for a range of Rubiscos from different species: Form I Rubisco from higher plants; prokaryotic Rubiscos, including Form II; and the L335V mutant. We explore the implications of these Delta values for the Rubisco catalytic mechanism and suggest that Rubiscos that are associated with a lower Delta value have a less product-like carboxylation transition state and/or allow a decarboxylation step that evolution has excluded in higher plants.									70	3	0	0	60	0	73			0021-9258	1083-351X		WOS:000251458100066	17925403	
J	Asada, K								The water-water cycle as alternative photon and electron sinks								PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF LONDON SERIES B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES				355	1402			1419	1430		10.1098/rstb.2000.0703				OCT 29 2000	2000	The water-water cycle in chloroplasts is the photoreduction of dioxygen to water in photosystem I (PS I) by the electrons generated in photosystem II (PS II) from water. In the water-water cycle, the rate of photoreduction of dioxygen in PS I is several orders of magnitude lower than those of the disproportionation of superoxide catalysed by superoxide dismutase, the reduction of hydrogen peroxide to water catalysed by ascorbate peroxidase, and the reduction of the resulting oxidized forms of ascorbate by reduced ferredoxin or catalysed by either dehydroascorbate reductase or monodehydroascorbate reductase. The water-water cycle therefore effectively shortens the lifetimes of photoproduced superoxide and hydrogen peroxide to suppress the production of hydroxyl radicals, their interactions with the target molecules in chloroplasts, and resulting photoinhibition. When leaves are exposed to photon intensities of sunlight in excess of that required to support the fixation of CO2, the intersystem electron carriers are over-reduced, resulting in photoinhibition. Under such conditions, the water-water cycle not only scavenges active oxygens, but also safely dissipates excess photon energy and electrons, in addition to downregulation of PS II and photorespiration. The dual functions of the water-water cycle for protection from photoinhibition under photon excess stress are discussed, along with its functional evolution.

J	Kogelschatz, M; Cunge, G; Sadeghi, N								Analysis of the chemical composition and deposition mechanism, of the SiOx-Cl-y layer on the plasma chamber walls during silicon gate etching								JOURNAL OF VACUUM SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY A				22	3			624	635		10.1116/1.1710496				MAY-JUN 2004	2004	During silicon gate etching in low pressure high density HBr/Cl-2/O-2 plasma, SiOClx layers are deposited on the reactor walls. These layers are at the origin of process drifts. However their chemical composition, deposition mechanism and their influence on the plasma chemistry remains poorly understood. In this study, the chemical composition of this layer has been investigated by a "plasma etching-sputtering" technique: the silicon oxychloride layer deposited on the reactor walls during the etching of a 200 mm diam silicon wafer has been subsequently submitted to an Ar plasma with the addition of a few % SF6. During the slow etch process of this layer, time-resolved optical emission spectroscopy and mass spectrometry have been used to follow the time evolution of the gas phase concentration of different atoms and radicals, the etch products of the SiOClx layer. The results give insight into the chemical nature of the deposited layer and of its variation as a function of the depth. In particular, it will be shown that these layers are chlorine-rich and not oxidelike. Also, their composition is not homogeneous through their depth. In a second set of experiments, the SiOClx, layer has been exposed to an Ar/O-2 plasma providing information on the oxidation mechanism of the Si-Cl bonds and thus on the SiOClx film deposition mechanism in HBr/Cl-2/O-2 plasmas. This oxidation mechanism is acting through the entire volume of the 10 nm thick layers and proceeds by substitution of Cl atoms of SiCl bonds by O atoms, resulting in desorption of a large amount of Cl atoms from the chamber walls during the layer oxidation. Finally, the layer on the chamber walls has been exposed to an Ar/Cl-2 plasma, demonstrating that SiOClx layers are not etched significantly by Cl atoms.

The detailed physical characterization and electrochemical analyses revealed that the C/Ni-AuPt (0.12 mg/mL of AuPt) alloy showed exceptional electrocatalytic activities for HER in acidic media, with a low over -potential of 0.131 V at 10 mA/cm(2), an exchange current density of 0.125 mA/cm(2), a Tafel slope of 66 mV/dec, and a Tafel constant of 0.060 V. Additionally, an optimized C/Ni-AuPt electrocatalyst showed a broad dynamic linear response (50-250 mu M) with high sensitivity (0.1134 mu A mu M(-1)cm(-2)) and low detection limit (0.185 mu M) for sensing 1,4-benzenediol. Furthermore, an optimized C/Ni-AuPt alloys exhibited excellent electrochemical performance, long-term durability, and structural stability owing to the electronic effect of effective charge transfer from Au to Pt atoms, caused by a shift in the d-band center of Pt in AuPt alloys. The addition of C/Ni increased the active-sites of AuPt alloys because of the synergistic effect. Consequently, they provided abundant electro-chemically active-surface areas necessary for the good dispersion of AuPt alloys. Alternatively, the strain effect was negligible in the C/Ni-AuPt structure. DFT calculations revealed that placing C/Ni NPs in direct contact with AuPt alloys displaces the d-band center of Au and Pt closer to the Fermi level, implying an increased activity of the electrocatalytic performance.									8	0	0	0	0	0	8			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000773523700004

Among these, water photocatalysis is considered one of the most renewable and sustainable processes simulated the solar energy utilized system in nature. During a half century, different kinds of photocatalysts were developed to convert photon energy into chemical energy to induce redox potential under visible light irradiation condition. In the beginning step, semiconductor materials, such as transition metal oxides, were explored extensively to use as a photocatalyst for hydrogen generation. However, semiconductor has limitations to act as an effective photocatalyst for water splitting due to the large band gap and recombination of charge carriers. Therefore, several kinds of modifications of structure or components have been studied to design visible light active photocatalysts for water splitting to generate hydrogen. Their performance was improved substantially by adding a noble metal or sensitizer to adjust the band gap and reduce the recombination of photoinduced charge carriers. Considering solar light-induced photocatalytic hydrogen generation, various visible light active photocatalysts have been derived from carbon chain organic compounds and lattice crystals. This review classifies the visible light active photocatalysts as follows: (a) structural and chemical components of modified graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4), (b) exfoliated perovskites, and (c) pi-bond conjugated polymers to produce hydrogen from water splitting. The hydrogen evolution efficiency of photocatalysts shows a great difference under visible light (lambda > 400 nm) irradiation according to the three-dimensional structure and electron transfer pathway. This is because the capability of restricting the recombination of photoinduced charge carriers and the band gap between the valence band and the conduction band of photocatalysts is dependent on the morphology and electrostatic interactions among components. This paper reviews visible light photocatalysts, that is, g-C3N4 based materials, layered perovskites, and conjugated polymers, to provide integrated insight into photocatalytic water splitting to obtain hydrogen.									7	0	0	0	0	0	7			0363-907X	1099-114X		WOS:000730133800001

Significant results reveal the morphological properties of ZnO nanostructures varied with different pH values with the formation of ZnO nano structures have different morphological such as a baton, star, flower, and rod-like structures. The present results show the rod-like structure of ZnO nanostructures exhibits the highest photocurrent density of 746.61 mu Acm(-2) (at 1.23 V vs RHE) under simulated solar AM 1.5G illumination in Potassium hydroxide (KOH) medium, also the other morphologies. The dependent of the photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting properties on the different morphological of ZnO nanostructures are studied. Achieving the morphological evolution mechanism has become one of the method to obtain the production of the hydrogen growth regime used for solar energy conversion and their applied storage potentials. The application of the ZnO nanostructures for PEC water splitting was proposed with the adoption of screen-printed carbon electrodes (SPCEs). These are to quantify the best degree of the highest photocurrent density with one-step tailoring with an ideal modeling system to enhance PEC water splitting performances. Thus, the screen-printed carbon electrodes (SPEs) has been used as an alternative method for fabrication and photoelectrodes testings. (C) 2019 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC.

Herein, a sea-urchin-structure g-C3N4 (CNSC) with similar to 2.0 eV bandgap was prepared using a hydrothermal strategy. It is important to note that CNSC can efficiently suppress h(+)-e(-) pair recombination and has a narrow bandgap which can utilize more visible light. Conventional g-C3N4 has a similar to 2.7 eV bandgap and valence band (VB) potential of +1.83 V vs. NHE but the VB of CNSC is +1.55 V. As a result, CNSC does not create H2O2, which can passivate g-C3N4. Density functional theory (DFT) confirms that C N, C=O and -OH groups in the CNSC shift the d-band centre of Pt closer to Fermi level, leading to better stabilization of adsorbate and higher catalytic performance. Photo-depositing Pt on the CNSC, 3 wt% Pt/CNSC produces H-2 and O-2 evolution rate (HER and OER) of 41.5 and 20.3 mu mol g(-1) h(-1) (apparent quantum efficiency: 0.43% at 420 +/- 10 nm), respectively, 30 times greater than HER of 2 wt% Pt/bulk g-C3N4 in overall water splitting under visible-light (lambda >= 420 nm). This work provides an innovative approach to construct hierarchical nanostructure g-C3N4 with narrow bandgap and paves the pathway for development of water splitting photocatalysts.									81	7	0	0	10	0	83			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000464487500027		
J	Zhang, Yun; Magdaong, Nikki; Frank, Harry A.; Rusling, James F.								Protein film voltammetry and co-factor electron transfer dynamics in spinach photosystem II core complex								PHOTOSYNTHESIS RESEARCH				120	1-2	SI		153	167		10.1007/s11120-013-9831-4				MAY 2014	2014	Direct protein film voltammetry (PFV) was used to investigate the redox properties of the photosystem II (PSII) core complex from spinach. The complex was isolated using an improved protocol not used previously for PFV. The PSII core complex had high oxygen-evolving capacity and was incorporated into thin lipid and polyion films. Three well-defined reversible pairs of reduction and oxidation voltammetry peaks were observed at 4 A degrees C in the dark. Results were similar in both types of films, indicating that the environment of the PSII-bound cofactors was not influenced by film type. Based on comparison with various control samples including Mn-depleted PSII, peaks were assigned to chlorophyll a (Chl a) (E (m) = -0.47 V, all vs. NHE, at pH 6), quinones (-0.12 V), and the manganese (Mn) cluster (E (m) = 0.18 V). PFV of purified iron heme protein cytochrome b-559 (Cyt b-559), a component of PSII, gave a partly reversible peak pair at 0.004 V that did not have a potential similar to any peaks observed from the intact PSII core complex. The closest peak in PSII to 0.004 V is the 0.18 V peak that was found to be associated with a two-electron process, and thus is inconsistent with iron heme protein voltammetry. The -0.47 V peak had a peak potential and peak potential-pH dependence similar to that found for purified Chl a incorporated into DMPC films. The midpoint potentials reported here may differ to various extents from previously reported redox titration data due to the influence of electrode double-layer effects. Heterogeneous electron transfer (hET) rate constants were estimated by theoretical fitting and digital simulations for the -0.47 and 0.18 V peaks. Data for the Chl a peaks were best fit to a one-electron model, while the peak assigned to the Mn cluster was best fit by a two-electron/one-proton model.									3	0	0	0	1	0	3			0166-8595	1573-5079		WOS:000333208600013	23625504

The average mass concentrations of PM1 (60-84 mu gm(-3)) and its chemical compositions in different campaigns of Beijing were relatively consistent in recent years. In summer, the daily variations of PM1 mass concentrations were stable and repeatable. Eighty-two percent of the PM1 mass concentration on average was composed of secondary species, where 62% is secondary inorganic aerosol and 20% secondary organic aerosol (SOA). In winter, PM1 mass concentrations changed dramatically because of the different meteorological conditions. The high average fraction (58%) of primary species in PM1 including primary organic aerosol (POA), black carbon, and chloride indicates primary emissions usually played a more important role in the winter. However, aqueous chemistry resulting in efficient secondary formation during occasional periods with high relative humidity may also contribute substantially to haze in winter. Results of past OA source apportionment studies in Beijing show 45-67% of OA in summer and 22-50% of OA in winter can be composed of SOA. Based on the source apportionment results, we found 45% POA in winter and 61% POA in summer are from nonfossil sources, contributed by cooking OA in both seasons and biomass burning OA (BBOA) in winter. Cooking OA, accounting for 13-24% of OA, is an important nonfossil carbon source in all years of Beijing and should not be neglected. The fossil sources of POA include hydrocarbon-like OA from vehicle emissions in both seasons and coal combustion OA (CCOA) in winter. The CCOA and BBOA were the two main contributors (57% of OA) for the highest OA concentrations (>100 mu gm(-3)) in winter. The POA/CO ratios in winter and summer are 11 and 16 mu gm(-3)ppm(-1), respectively, similar to ratios from western cities. Higher OOA/O-x (=NO2+O-3) ratio (0.49 mu gm(-3)ppb(-1)) in winter study than these ratios from western cities (0.03-0.16 mu gm(-3)ppb(-1)) was observed, which may be due to the aqueous reaction or extra SOA formation contributed by semivolatile organic compounds from various primary sources (e.g., BBOA or CCOA) in Beijing. The evolution of oxygen to carbon ratio (O/C) with photochemical age allows to estimate an equivalent rate constant for chemical aging of OA in summer as k(OH)similar to 4.1x10(-12)cm(3)molecule(-1)s(-1), which is of the same order as obtained in other anthropogenic influenced areas and may be useful for OA modeling.									210	27	0	0	104	0	230			2169-897X	2169-8996		WOS:000372977900037

Bcl-2 genes have been well studied in mammals, while they are not well investigated in teleost fish including channel catfish, the major aquaculture species in the United States. In this study, we identified 34 bcl-2 genes from the channel catfish genome, and verified their identities by conducting phylogenetic and syntenic analyses. The expression profiles of the bcl-2 genes in response to bacterial infections (Edwardsiella ictaluri and Flavobacterium columnare) and hypoxia stress were determined by performing meta-analysis using the existing RNA-Seq datasets. Differential expressions of bcl-2 genes were observed after bacterial infections and hypoxia treatment, including 22 bcl-2 genes after E. ictaluri infection, 22 bcl-2 genes after F. columnare infection, and 19 bcl-2 genes after hypoxia stress. Overall, the expression of the proapoptotic bcl-2 genes were repressed after bacterial infection and hypoxia stress, indicating that bcl-2 genes are potentially involved in the stress response by reducing cell apoptosis. Some bcl-2 genes, such as bcl2b, mcl1a, bmf1, and bnip3, showed different expression pattern during the E. ictaluri and F columnare infection, suggesting the difference in the pathogenicity of diseases. This work presented the first systematic identification and annotation of bcl-2 genes in catfish, providing essential genomic resources for further immune and physiological studies.

Agriculture and Life Sciences				43	5			599	607	1008-9209(2017)43:5<599:C2QDXP>2.0.TX;2-#					2017	2017	Summary The cigarette beetle, Lasioderma serricorne (Fabricius) (Coleoptera: Anobiidae), is a destructive stored pest distributed worldwide. Females typically oviposit in the stored materials, and the developing larvae tunnel through the stored food products on which they feed, resulting in tremendous damages to stored grains and seeds, tobacco, pet food, and dried flowers. Currently, excessive use of fumigation with insecticides has developed resistance to commonly insecticides in this insect, leading to environmental risk and its resurgence. Controlled atmosphere (CA) treatments using low oxygen (O_2) and high carbon dioxide (CO_2) have been used commercially to control stored pests. The application of CA is a safe alternative way to chemical pesticides, and has been used to control the cigarette beetles. Our earlier studies showed that L. serricorne displayed a great capacity to withstand CO_2 stress. The activities of glutathione S-transferases (GSTs) in L. serricorne were significantly increased after exposed to CO_2 enriched atmosphere, implying that GSTs might be critical for tolerating to CO_2 stress. However, little is known about the molecular mechanism of GSTs in response to CO_2 exposure in L. serricorne. In this study, three full-length cDNAs of GSTs in L. serricorne were cloned by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT- PCR). The deduced amino acid sequence analysis of the three genes was performed by bioinformatics methods. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) was used to establish expression profiles for those genes from different developmental stages and in response to CO_2 exposure. According to the predicted GST sequences from the transcriptome datesets of L. serricorne, the full-length cDNAs of three novel genes were obtained and named LsGSTt1, LsGSTd1 and LsGSTs1 (GenBank accession numbers: KY549655, KY549656, KY549657), respectively. The LsGSTt1 cDNA contained an open reading frame (ORF) of 564 nucleotides, encoding a polypeptide of 187 amino acids with an estimated molecular mass of 22.4 kDa and an isoelectric point (pI) of 8.54. The LsGSTd1 cDNA contained an ORF of 651 nucleotides, encoding a polypeptide of 216 amino acids with an estimated molecular mass of 24.5 kDa and a pI of 5.95. The LsGSTs1 cDNA contained an ORF of 696 nucleotides, encoding a polypeptide of 231 amino acids with an estimated molecular mass of 26.2 kDa and a pI of 5.06. Homology analysis indicated that the predicted amino acid sequences of the three genes had typical features of GSTs, including an Nterminal domain and a C-terminal domain. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that the three genes belonged to three different cytosolic classes, including Theta (LsGSTt1), Delta (LsGSTd1) and Sigma (LsGSTs1). Temporal expression profile revealed that all the three GSTs genes were constitutively expressed in the testing stages, exhibited similar developmental expression patterns, with the highest expression level measured in the early larval stage. Compared with the control, the mRNA levels of LsGSTd1 did not change significantly following exposure to CO_2 stress. However, when exposed to 50% lethal concentration (LC50) of CO_2, the expression levels of LsGSTt1 and LsGSTs1 were significantly increased. In conclusion, the results suggest that LsGSTt1 and LsGSTs1 in L. serricorne might play important roles in defense responses challenged by CO_2 stress. This study provides the basis for clarifying the response mechanism of insects to CO_2 stress.			根据烟草甲(Lasioderma serricorne)转录组数据信息,克隆获得3个谷胱甘肽S-转移酶(glutathione Stransferases, GSTs)基因的cDNA全长序列,同源性比对和系统进化分析表明,这3个基因分别属于GSTs基因Theta、 Delta和Sigma家族,分别命名为LsGSTt1、LsGSTd1和LsGSTs1(GenBank登录号:KY549655、KY549656和 KY549657),并分析了其在烟草甲不同发育阶段和CO_2气调胁迫后的表达特征,为研究烟草甲GSTs基因的生物学功能提供依据。实时荧光定量聚合酶链式反应(quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction, qRT-PCR)结果显示:烟草甲LsGSTt1、LsGSTd1和LsGSTs1基因在不同发育阶段均有表达,且在低龄幼虫中表达量最高,显著高于其他时期;经LC_(10)、LC_(30)和LC_(50) 3种CO_2浓度处理低龄幼虫6 h后,烟草甲LsGSTd1表达量相对于对照组无明显变化,而 LsGSTt1和LsGSTs1表达量显著高于对照组,推测这2个基因可能主要参与了烟草甲对CO_2气调胁迫的应激响应。						3	1	0	0	3	0	4			1008-9209			CSCD:6113091

It is focused on the terrestrial planets which have a dense atmosphere of N-2 or CO2, i.e. Venus, the Earth and Mars, but also includes Titan, the largest satellite of Saturn, which has a dense atmosphere composed mainly of N-2 and a few percent of methane. Given the composition of these neutral atmospheres, the following species are considered: C++, N++, O++, CH4++, CO++, N-2(++), NO++, O-2(++), Ar++ and CO2++. We first discuss the status of their detection in the atmospheres of planets. Then, we provide a comprehensive review of their complex and original photochemistry, production and loss processes. Synthesis tables are provided for those ions, while a discussion on individual species is also provided. Methods for detecting doubly-charged ions in planetary atmospheres are presented, namely with mass-spectrometry, remote sensing and fine plasma density measurements. A section covers some original applications, like the possible effect of the presence of doubly-charged ions on the escape of an atmosphere, which is a key topic of ongoing planetary exploration, related to the evolution of a planet. The results of models, displayed in a comparative way for Venus, Earth, Mars and Titan, are discussed, as they can predict the presence of doubly-charged ions and will certainly trigger new investigations. Finally we give our view concerning next steps, challenges and needs for future studies, hoping that new scientific results will be achieved in the coming years and feed the necessary interdisciplinary exchanges amongst different scientific communities.									82	6	0	0	2	0	82			1463-9076	1463-9084		WOS:000295731100003	21931881	
J	Kida, K; Morimura, S; Tanemura, K								Development of efficient methane fermentation processes for global environmental protection - Monograph								SEIBUTSU-KOGAKU KAISHI				74	5			381	396						1996	1996	The use of methane fermentation as a general process for the treatment of various types of wastewater was evaluated, using an anaerobic fluidized-bed reactor (AFBR). Good performance of the support medium used in the AFBR process appeared to be primarily dependent on a positive surface charge. Silanol groups were very effective for adsorption if inorganic materials were used for the support medium. Sewage could be efficiently treated, even at a hydraulic retention time of 6 h and at 15 degrees C. Treating low-strength wastewater from a sugar-manufacturing plant in three stages, comprising anaerobic, aerobic, and activated carbon adsorption processes, resulted in an effluent with a quality comparable to that of tap water except for the inorganic carbon and conductivity. Middle-strength wastewater from a brewery could be more effectively treated by a two-stage AFBR than by a single-stage one. Sewage sludge was efficiently treated by a modified two-stage digestion process with liquefaction of thickened surplus sludge. The maximum volumetric loading rate of VSS in this process was two to three times higher than that of the conventional process. The VSS digestion efficiency also increased by around 10% compared to that in the conventional process at the same volumetric loading rate. Slurries containing 20% (v/v) coffee waste solids were treated anaerobically in two-phase thermophilic methane Fermentation with slurry-state liquefaction. By repeated batchwise treatment, the degradation efficiency of coffee waste and the maximum gas evolution rate per total volume including the liquefaction increased to 70% and 1.43 l/l . d, respectively. High-strength wastewater with a high salt content from a pickled-plum manufacturer was also treated effectively in the AFBR after the wastewater was diluted more than five times. The red pigment in the wastewater was completely decolorized under all conditions examined. When five-fold-diluted shochu distillery wastewater without suspended solids, to which trace elements such as Ni2+ and Co2+ had been added, was treated in the AFBR, a maximum TOC volumetric loading rate of 42 g/l . d, with a TOC removal efficiency of 78%, was achieved. This rate was four times higher than that without the addition of the mineral nutrients, and corresponded to a BOD loading rate of 68 g/l . d. The problem of accumulation of NH4+ (about 1,000 mg/l) and propionic acid during methane fermentation was resolved by the utilization of residual propionic acid as an electron donor during the denitrification and nitrification reactions. Effluent was recycled from the nitrification reactor to the denitrification reactor to remove NH4+ and volatile fatty acids simultaneously. In conclusion, methane fermentation was found to be a highly efficient process for the treatment of a wide variety of effluents.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0919-3758			WOS:A1996VM39200003		
J	An, Huiqin; Lv, Zhaotao; Zhang, Kun; Deng, Congying; Wang, Hong; Xu, Zongwei; Wang, Meiri; Yin, Zhen								Plasmonic coupling enhancement of core-shell Au@Pt assemblies on ZnIn2S4 nanosheets towards photocatalytic H-2 production								APPLIED SURFACE SCIENCE				536						147934	10.1016/j.apsusc.2020.147934				JAN 15 2021	2021	Hydrogen production via photocatalytic water splitting would be a promising technique for the utilization of hydrogen energy and solar energy. Surface plasmon resonance (SPR) of noble metal nanoparticles (NPs), such as Au, offers a fascinating arena to develop efficient photocatalysts with superior visible light harvesting properties and excellent catalytic activities. However, the photocatalytic performance enhancement based on SPR effect is limited by the relatively small contribution of the isolated plasmonic NPs. In the present work, the Au@Pt/ZnIn2S4 (ZIS) photocatalyst can be successfully constructed by the assemblies of core-shell Au@Pt NPs, consisted of plasmonic Au NP surrounded by catalytic Pt NPs, on three-dimensional (3D) ZIS microsphere in consideration of collective excitation of plasmonic NPs assemblies, demonstrating extraordinary catalytic performance of hydrogen production under visible light (>= 420 nm) during water splitting process. The H-2 production amount and rate over Au16@Pt/ZIS can reach 41747 mu mol g(-1) and 4174.7 mu mol g(-1)h(-1) under visible light, about 10 times higher than those of ZIS, respectively. The apparent quantum yield (AQY) of Au16@Pt/ZIS dramatically rises to 6.23%, nearly 10 times than that of ZIS (0.62%). Hence, the assembly formation of core-shell NPs and the introduction of ZIS can significantly enhance the photocatalytic performance of plasmonic metal NPs. The experimental results and FDTD simulation confirm that the plasmonic coupling effect of Au@Pt assemblies can generate much intensive electromagnetic (EM) field on ZIS surface, which further extends the light harvesting to visible-to-near infrared region and simultaneously boosts the generation rate of plasmon-induced hot electrons from Au and photoexcited electrons from ZIS. In addition, the Pt shell plays the role of electron sink, leading to the efficiently separation of electron-holes in Au NPs and ZIS and thus further increase the H-2 evolution. All of these make Au@Pt/ZIS possess the extraordinary H-2 evolution ability. We believe that the present strategy would be a significant contribution to design and prepare the efficient photocatalysts based on the plasmonic effect towards water splitting.									29	2	0	0	0	0	29			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000580627000096

Three products of the degradation of CP43, with molecular masses of 17.0, 15.5, and 14 kDa, respectively, were identified by sodium dodecyl sulfate/urea polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and Western blotting with a specific antibody. Degradation products of another antenna chlorophyll-binding protein of PS II, CP47, were not detected under the same conditions. Concomitant with the damage to the D1 and D2 proteins and CP43, cross-linked products of the D1 protein, CP43, and CP47 were formed. These products were identified as slow-moving smeared bands in the higher molecular weight range of the gel during electrophoresis. Both the degradation and the cross-linking of these proteins were prevented by the addition of electron donors to PS II, a result that suggests that these processes were caused by the donor-side mechanism of photoinhibition. The photoinduced degradation of CP43 and the cross-linking among the D1 protein, CP43, and CP47 were less obvious in the PS II membranes that had been treated with hydroxylamine rather than Tris and in the membranes that had been treated with Tris and reconstituted by addition of an extrinsic 33-kDa protein (OEC33). These results indicate that removal of OEC33, which is closely associated with CP43, from the PS II complex accelerates the degradation and cross-linking of CP43 during photoinhibition. It is suggested that OEC33 is involved in the stabilization of the antenna chlorophyll-binding proteins in PS II during photoinhibition.									56	6	0	0	50	0	62			0006-2960			WOS:A1995RK55400012	7619803

Practical implementation of WO3/BiVO4 is often limited by poor stability arising from the leaching of V5+ from BiVO4 during PEC operations. Herein, we demonstrate that the synthesis of a tungsten oxide/bismuth vanadate/titanium oxide (WO3/BiVO4/TiO2) heterostructure onto a fluorine-doped tin oxide-coated glass substrate through a combined simple hydrothermal-spin coating strategy will advance PEC performance while slowing water oxidation kinetics and improving photostability. We show that surface postmodification with a nanometer-thick layer of (1 0 1) monofacet-selective single-crystalline TiO2 provides stable photocurrent density, up to 1.04 mA cm(-2) at 1.23 V (compared to a reversible hydrogen electrode in 0.5 M Na2SO4), with excellent quantum efficiency (45% at 460 nm) and long-term photostability (24 h). Interestingly, crystalline TiO2 activation layers behave differently from previous TiO2 amorphous layers, blocking surface defects while improving corrosion resistance, photostability, and the electron transfer process. These results indicate a approximate to 2.5 times enhancement in photoelectrocatalytic activity related to referenced WO3/BiVO4 photoanodes, encouraging the use of single-crystalline TiO2 modulations to develop a range of materials for PEC/photocatalytic applications.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000703637200001	34610073

Among these variations, the presence of IS elements accounts for much of the heterogeneity. Such a rearrangement could play a key role in the evolution of the vanA gene cluster, and hence, it may modify its transferability. In this study, we characterized the consequence of Tn1546 in vanA-containing Enterococcus faecium isolates collected from patients over time. From 1998 to 2004, 57 vanA-containing E. faecium isolates were collected from hospitalized patients at Ajou University Hospital in Korea. PCR amplification of internal regions of Tn1546 was performed, and both DNA strands were directly sequenced by the dideoxy termination method. All isolates were divided into three main types, including the prototype, according to the distribution of IS elements integrated into Tn1546 elements. Type I was characterized by an IS1542 insertion in the orf2-vanR intergenic region and an IS1216V insertion in the vanX-vanY intergenic region. Type II was represented by the presence of two copies of IS1216V at the 3' end of IS1542 and in the vanX-vanY intergenic region, as well as IS1542 in the orf2-vanR intergenic region. Seventeen strains isolated from 1998 to 2000 represented type I, and 38 strains isolated from 2000 to 2004 represented type H. The remaining two isolates were the prototype. The tendency for the rearrangement of Tn1546 was that the sequences were shortened as time passed, especially at the left or the right end, and hence, this could gradually modulate their transferability.									9	0	0	0	9	0	9			0095-1137			WOS:000251630000006	17898158

A gradual increase in temperature caused the appearance of K-bands at 300 us on the chlorophyll fluorescence induction curve, indicating the impairment of the PSII donor side (even by heat treatment at 38 degrees C). An increase in basal fluorescence, commonly used as a criterion of PSII thermostability, was observed beyond a temperature threshold of 44 degrees C. Moreover, an acclimation shift (increase of critical temperature) was observed at the 3.5 degrees C identified for K-band appearance, but only by 1.1 degrees C for a steep increase in F-0. The single temperature approach with regular weekly observations completed within two months using dark heat treatment at 40 degrees C demonstrated that the acclimation effect is not gradual, but occurs immediately and is associated with an increase of daily temperature maxima over 30 degrees C. The acclimated heat treated samples had less effect on the donor side of PSII, the higher fraction of active Q((S) over bar) reducing reaction centers and causing a much lower decrease of connectivity among PSII units compared to non-acclimated samples. In the non-treated plants the reduction of antennae size, increase of PSII connectivity and changes in the acceptor side occurred as a result of heat acclimation. The enhancement of PSII thermostability persisted over several weeks regardless of weather conditions. The genotype comparison identified three groups that differed either in initial PSII thermostability or in acclimation capacity; these groupings were clearly associated with the origin of the genotypes.

Our results show that Cu2+ has inhibitory effects on both the donor and the acceptor side of photosystem II. In the presence of Cu2+, neither EPR signal IIvery (fast) nor signal IIfast, which both reflect oxidation of tyrosine(Z), could be induced by illumination. This shows that Cu2+ inhibits electron transfer from tyrosine(Z) to the oxidized primary donor P680(+). Instead of tyrosine(Z) oxidation, illumination results in the formation of a new radical with g = 2.0028 +/- 0.0002 and a spectral width of 9.5 +/- 0.3 G. At room temperature, this radical amounts to one spin per PS IT reaction center. Incubation of photosystem II membranes with cupric ions also results in release of the 16 kDa extrinsic subunit and conversion of cytochrome b(559) to the low-potential form. On the acceptor side, QA can still be reduced by illumination or chemical reduction with dithionite. However, incubation with Cu2+ results in loss of the normal EPR signal from Q(A)(-) which is coupled to the non-heme Fe2+ on the acceptor side (the Q(A)(-)-Fe2+ EPR signal). Instead, reduction of QA results in the formation of a free radical spectrum which is 9.5 G wide and centered at g = 2.0044. This signal is attributed to Q(A)(-) which is magnetically decoupled from the nonheme iron. This suggests that Cu2+ displaces the Fe2+ or severly alters its binding properties. The inhibition of tyrosine(Z) is reversible upon removal of the copper ions with EDTA while the modification of Q(A) was found to be irreversible.									74	1	3	0	64	1	78			0006-2960			WOS:A1995RY46000034	7548028

Both density functional theory (DFT) and experimental results implied that the type II g-C3N4/BiVO4 composite can be switched to Z-scheme via Ag nanoparticles as the electron shuttle. The optimal photocatalytic H-2 yield rate achieved for g-C3N4/Ag/BiVO4 was 57.4 mu mol.g(-1).h(-1), being far surpassed the H-2 harvest rate of g-C3N4/BiVO4, Ag/g-C3N4 and g-C3N4, which is 2.9, 14.8 and 1.7 mu mol.g(-1).h(-1), respectively. The apparent quantum efficiency of g-C3N4/Ag/BiVO4 photocatalyst was also determined to be 1.23%. Besides, the photocatalytic performance of g-C3N4/Ag/BiVO4 well preserved over 5 runs in 50 h. The improved H-2 production performance is considered as the consequence of promoted segregation of photoexcited charge carriers and SPR effects of Ag nanoparticles. In combination with photocurrent measurement, examination of active species and DFT calculation, it is found that Ag nanoparticles as an electron mediator can highly promote the Z-scheme carrier migration that electrons come from conduction band of BiVO4 will quickly assemble with the photo-induced holes from valence band of g-C3N4, leaving electrons in the conduction band of g-C3N4 and holes in valence band of BiVO4 that could greatly enhance the charge separation efficiency.

In this study, Fe3+ was deposited on the surface of MIL-125 after its hydrothermal synthesis. Targeted Fe-doped titania photocatalysts were prepared through the direct calcination in air of Fe/MIL-125 crystals and/or by using a two-step method, including carbonization in inert atmosphere followed by calcination in air. The relationship between the synthesis conditions and the properties of the Fe-doped titania nanopowders, such as Fe content, porosity, phase composition and particle size was investigated. From elemental mapping, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, X-ray absorption spectroscopy, UV-Vis absorption spectroscopy and photoluminescence emission spectra, the presence of highly dispersed Fe3+ ions incorporated into the TiO2 crystal lattice was confirmed, which led to a significant red shift of photo-response towards visible light and reduced the recombination rate of electron-hole pairs at low iron content. By varying the pre-carbonization temperature, both crystal size and phase composition in the final materials were modulated. The performance of Fe-doped titania materials in photocatalytic water-splitting was tested for hydrogen evolution. Optimal photocatalytic performance was found at 0.15 and 0.5 wt% iron concentration and exceeded those of non-doped titania and commercial anatase both under visible and UV light irradiation, respectively, and among the highest reported in literature for these systems.									82	4	0	0	10	0	84			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000460964000010

The late Archean atmosphere is widely recognized to be anoxic (pO(2,g) = 10(-5) to 10(-13) bars; pH(2,g) = 10(-3) to 10(-5) bars). Detrital siderite (FeCO3), pyrite (FeS2), and uraninite (UO2) in late Archean sedimentary rocks also suggest anoxic conditions. However, whether the observed detrital minerals could have been thermodynamically stable during weathering and riverine transport under such an atmosphere remains untested. Similarly, interpretations of fluctuations recorded by trace metals and isotopes are hampered by a lack of knowledge of the chemical linkages between the atmosphere, weathering, riverine transport, and the mineralogical record.In this study, we used theoretical reaction path models to simulate the chemistry involved in rainwater and weathering processes under present-day and hypothetical Archean atmospheric boundary conditions. We included new estimates of the thermodynamic properties of Fe(II)-smectites as well as smectite and calcite solid solutions. Simulation of present-day weathering of basalt + calcite by world average rainwater produced hematite, kaolinite, Na-Mg-saponite, and chalcedony after 10(-4) moles of reactant minerals kg(-1) H2O were destroyed. Combination of the resultant water chemistry with results for granitic weathering produced a water composition comparable to present-day world-average river water (WARW). In contrast, under late Archean atmospheric conditions (pCO(2,g) = 10(-1.5) and pH(2,g) = 10(-5.0) bars), weathering of olivine basalt + calcite to the same degree of reaction produced kaolinite, chalcedony, and Na-Fe(lI)-rich-saponite. Late Archean weathering of tonalite-trondhjemite-granodiorite (TTG) formed Fe(II)-rich beidellite and chalcedony. Combining the waters from olivine basalt and TM weathering resulted in a model for late Archean WARW with the composition Na+-Ca2+-Fe2+-Mg2+-Cl--HCO3--SiO2,aq. The, pH of the water was 6.3 and it is much richer in HCO3-, and in Mg + Fe relative to Ca + Na, compared to present-day WARW. At higher pH(2,g) (e.g. 10(-4). bars) organic acid anions could be metastable. Our results are consistent with the thermodynamic stability of Fe(II)-clays, pyrite, uraninite, and, under some conditions, siderite during weathering and riverine transport. Overall, our results provide a basis for assessing the formation of organic hazes and the mobility of trace elements and nutrients due to fluctuations of the late Archean atmosphere.

Glenn, Anthony/0000-0001-8329-1306			Characterization of two catalase-peroxidase-encoding genes in Fusarium verticillioides reveals differential responses to in vitro versus in planta oxidative challenges								MOLECULAR PLANT PATHOLOGY				19	5			1127	1139		10.1111/mpp.12591				MAY 2018	2018	Catalase-peroxidases (KatGs) are a superfamily of reactive oxygen species (ROS)-degrading enzymes believed to have been horizontally acquired by ancient Ascomycota from bacteria. Subsequent gene duplication resulted in two KatG paralogues in ascomycetes: the widely distributed intracellular KatG1 group and the phytopathogen-dominated extracellular KatG2 group. To functionally characterize FvCP01 (KatG1) and FvCP02 (KatG2) in the maize pathogen Fusarium verticillioides, single and double gene deletion mutants were examined in response to hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). Both FvCP01 and FvCP02 were more sensitive to H2O2 than the wild-type invitro, although their sensitivity differed depending on the type of inoculum. Inoculations using mycelial agar plugs demonstrated an additive effect of the mutants, with the FvCP01/FvCP02 double deletion being the most sensitive to H2O2. In general, conidia were much more sensitive than agar plugs to H2O2, and conidial inoculations indicated that FvCP01 conferred more H2O2 tolerance than FvCP02. Transcriptional analysis showed the induction of FvCP01, but decreased expression of FvCP02, in both mycelia and spores in the wild-type after H2O2 exposure, but this trend was reversed when the fungus was grown on germinating maize seeds. This interaction with the plant increased the expression of FvCP02, but not FvCP01, indicating that FvCP02 may be responsive to plant-derived H2O2. Yet, FvCP01 was induced more than three-fold in the FvCP02 mutant grown on germlings, suggesting that FvCP01 can compensate for the loss of FvCP02. Given the differential responses of these two F.verticillioides genes to invitro versus inplanta challenges, a model is proposed to illustrate the differing roles of FvCP01 and FvCP02 in protective responses against H2O2-derived oxidative stress.									6	0	0	0	5	0	6			1464-6722	1364-3703		WOS:000429717500007	28802018

An additional bias DC electric field was applied to heat electrons during the discharge afterglow between the high-voltage pulses. The energy input per pulse was so small that the changes in both chemical composition and gas temperature were negligible. Using the microwave interferometer, the temporal evolution of the electron density in the discharge afterglow was measured when it decreased from 3 x 10(12) to 5 x 10(10) cm(-3). Measurements were performed for various numbers of discharge pulses (various degrees of fuel oxidation) at room gas temperature and pressures from 1 to 2 Torr. The effect of electron heating on the rate of plasma decay was most profound for low oxidation degrees and practically disappeared after complete fuel oxidation. A kinetic model was suggested for describing ion-molecule processes and plasma decay in the discharge afterglow at various H-2 oxidation degrees. The analysis of calculated results showed that plasma decay was governed by dissociative recombination of electrons with simple molecular ions at low oxidation degrees and with hydrated H3O+(H2O) (k) ions at sufficiently high oxidation degrees. An increase of H2O fraction due to H-2 oxidation in the mixture led to a less efficient electron heating during plasma decay in the additional electric field. This was associated with extremely high cross-sections for the elastic and inelastic scattering of low-energy electrons by H2O molecules. As a result, the rate of electron-ion recombination increased with increasing number of discharge pulses, whereas the effect of electric field became less profound, in agreement with the observations.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			0022-3727	1361-6463		WOS:000658875100001

Light electron microscopy, scanning electron microscopy and quantitative electron probe microanalysis were used to characterize the samples prior to the electrochemical tests. The experiments were carried out in 1 M KOH solution at 298 K. Potentiodynamic polarization curves and potentiostatic current decay transients revealed that Co-Ni-R alloys significantly improved resistance to corrosion compared with Co-Ni alloys, in spite of their two-phase microstructure, as a direct consequence of the presence of the praseodymium and erbium rare earth metals in the anodic layer formation.

We have used a silica-induced multistep lung carcinogenesis model driven by chronic inflammation to study the evolution of molecular markers and genetic alterations. We analyzed markers of DNA damage response (DDR), proliferative stress, and telomeric stress: gamma-H2AX, p16, p53, and TERT. Lung cancer -related epigenetic and genetic alterations, including promoter hypermethylation status of p16(CDKN2A), APC, CDH13, Rassf1, and Nore1A, as well as mutations of Tp53, epidermal growth factor receptor, K-ras, N-ras, and c-H-ras, have been also studied. Our results showed DDR pathway activation in preneoplastic lesions, in association with inducible nitric oxide synthase and p53 induction. p16 was also induced in early tumorigenic progression and was inactivated in bronchiolar dysplasias and tumors. Remarkably, lack of mutations of Ras and epidermal growth factor receptor, and a very low frequency of Tp53 mutations suggest that they are not required for tumorigenesis in this model. In contrast, epigenetic alterations in p16(CDKN2A), CDH13, and APC, but not in Rassf1 and Nore1A, were clearly observed. These data suggest the existence of a specific molecular signature of inflammation-driven lung carcinogenesis that shares some, but not all, of the molecular landmarks of chemically induced lung cancer.									78	3	1	0	63	0	82			1522-8002			WOS:000250427800007	17971904

Herein we report for the first time the use of cobalt phosphide (CoP) as a highly active cocatalyst on hematite photoanode for high-performance photoelectrochemical water splitting. CoP nanoparticles can be deposited on a bilayer Ti-doped porous hematite (Ti-PH) photoanode by a facile drop-casting method. The results show that CoP can significantly increase the hole injection efficiency and reduce the charge transport resistance (R-ct) in the Ti-PH. Under optimal conditions, the as-prepared CoP modified Ti-PH photoanode exhibits excellent and stable photoelectrochemical water oxidation performance with a current density of 2.1 mA/cm(2) at 1.23 V vs. RHE, which is among the best values using noble-metal-free hematite-based photoanodes for water splitting. At an applied bias of 1.23 V vs. RHE, the hole injection efficiency of Ti-PH/CoP is similar to 90%, which is close to 96% at a higher potential. The IPCE value of optimal Ti-PH/CoP can reach to 40.3% at 1.23 V versus RHE (at 380 nm). In addition, the photocurrent onset potential cathodically shifted by similar to 180 mV compared to Ti-doped hematite photoanode under AM 1.5G illumination (100 mW/cm(2)). (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc.

However, bulk gCN suffers from the small BET surface area and quick recombination of carriers. The photocatalytic activity of bulk gCN still needs to be improved. Herein, we systematically studied the effect of post calcination times (PCT) on the visible photoreactivity of bulk gCN towards NO oxidation and hydrogen production. It was found that aggregated gCN nanosheets (gCN-NSs) were formed after repeated calcination of bulk gCN. The BET surface areas of gCN-NSs increased 6.6 times (from 9.1 to 60.5 m(2) g(-1)) after repeated calcination of bulk gCN for 7 times. The exfoliation of bulk gCN by post calcination results in a reduced PL intensity, increased photocurrent, diminished arc radius of EIS Nynquist plot. DFT calculation confirms the enlarged bandgap of gCN after post calcination. After repeated calcination for 7 times, the visible photoreactivity of gCN-NSs towards NO oxidation increased from 20.6% to 35.8% in a continuous reactor, and the hydrogen production rate improved from 31.3 to 764.8 umol g(-1) h(-1) in a batch reactor, enhanced by a factor of 24.4. The post calcination induced enhancement on the visible photocatalytic activity of gCN-NSs can be attributed to the combined effects of (1) enlarged BET surface area, (2) improved crystallinity, (3) negatively shifted CB position, and (4) exposure of (0 0 2) and (1 0 0) facets for g-CN-NSs which retarded the recombination of electron and hole pairs.									60	7	0	0	13	0	62			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000449683100118

Macroscopic properties of black ceramics strongly depend on the quality of the interfaces between grains of solid filler (graphite, carbon black) and coke originating from the pyrolysis of the binder; thus, the binder should correctly wet the filler prior to the carbonisation process. Coal-tar pitch usually exhibits a high affinity for carbon grains. In the effect of the amount of sulphur on the viscosity of the molten binder and on the way the present work, it wets the solid filler was investigated. For that purpose, the penetration of mixtures of coal-tar pitch and sulphur inside a bed of carbon particles was studied as a function of temperature. The influence of the sulphur content on composition, optical texture, and transport properties of the derived black ceramics, as well as the way it was mixed with the other constituents, were also examined. It was found that the preparation of black ceramics may be achieved easily and in safe conditions, without evolution of H2S, using pitch-sulphur mixtures first molten in a bladed mixer, and having sulphur contents within the range 10-20 wt.%. The presence of sulphur increases the coke yield but lowers the ability to graphitise, thus limiting the transport properties of the resultant black ceramic. The optimal concentration of sulphur should thus be a compromise between mechanical strength and other physical properties. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

In this study, the considered cell presents a premature degradation during electrolysis operation observed after sealing the cell holder and the support pieces providing and releasing H-2 electrode gas. This premature degradation is characterized by unusual polarization curve slopes, and appearance of a new impedance contribution at the lowest frequencies of the impedance diagrams recorded. To the best of our knowledge, this new contribution has never been reported for SOECs. Post-mortem analysis of the cell by scanning electron microscopy (SEM)/energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) shows the presence of Si, Al, Na, K, and Ca at the H-2 electrode interface (surface and first dozens microns in the volume) and at the Ni-yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ)/YSZ interface, contrary to similar cells tested before sealing the pieces. This degradation is related to Si deposition, notably at the Ni/YSZ/H2O triple phase boundaries. Concomitantly, the new contribution observed, leading to a beneficial effect on the cell functioning, is assimilated to a reactivation contribution. This reactivation contribution is associated with an H2O adsorption phenomenon and characterized by a relaxation frequency of [1-10mHz] and a capacitance of similar to 100Fcm(-2). The evolution with time of the resistive and capacitive contributions is consistent with the interpretation of the premature cell degradation. A mechanism explaining the cell behavior after this premature degradation is proposed.									7	0	0	0	0	0	7			1432-8488	1433-0768		WOS:000455274100012

In addition to the layered structures, MPX3 comprising post-transition metals (i.e., Sn and Pb) are known to form a unique 3D framework with nonlayered structure. However, the nonlayered two-dimensional (2D) crystals of this family have remained unexplored until now. Herein, we successfully synthesized 2D nonlayered tin thiohypodiphosphate (Sn2P2S6) nanosheets, having an indirect bandgap of 2.25 eV and a thickness down to similar to 10 nm. The as-obtained nanosheets demonstrate promising photocatalytic water splitting activity to generate H-2 in pure water under simulated solar light (AM 1.5G). Moreover, the ultrathin Sn2P2S6 catalyst shows auspicious performance and stability with a continuous operation of 40 h. This work is not only an expansion of the MPX3 family, but it is also a major milestone in the search for new materials for future energy conversion.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000634759500076	33719413

These methods are i. estimation based on kinetic model of overflow metabolism; ii. estimation based on metabolic black-box model; iii. estimation based on observer; iv. estimation based on artificial neural network; v. estimation based on differential evaluation. Biomass concentrations are estimated from available measurements and compared with experimental data obtained from large scale fermentations. The advantages and disadvantages of the presented techniques are discussed with regard to accuracy, reproducibility, number of primary measurements required and adaptation to different working conditions. Among the various techniques, the metabolic black-box method seems to have advantages although the number of measurements required is more than that for the other methods. However, the required extra measurements are based on commonly employed instruments in an industrial environment. This method is used for developing a model based control of fed-batch yeast fermentations. (C) 2010 ISA. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

A mutant, FUD 39, lacking the Cl--concentrating 23-kDa psbP protein of photosystem II was found to have a decreased capability to perform photoactivation. The yield of the process never reached wild type level, and contrary to the wild type, it was highly dependent on the intensity of the activating Light, with a very narrow optimum around 1 mu E m(-2) s(-1). The different behavior in the mutant can be explained by a requirement for a longer dark period, between the two photoacts, during the photoactivation. This is proposed to reflect the decreased Cl--affinity in the mutant. Photoactivation in the mutant was also found to be very sensitive to competing photoinhibitory processes. The inhibition was located to the donor side of photosystem II and affected the photoactivation capability before electron transfer from Tyr(z) was inhibited. We propose an extended model for photoactivation in which an intermediate that is sensitive to photoinhibition is formed if Cl- is not functionally bound to the manganese cluster.									38	1	0	0	33	0	38			0021-9258			WOS:A1996VT05200032	8910540

Graphene-based materials particularly graphene oxide and reduced graphene oxide are widely utilized in various applications ranging from food industry, environmental monitoring and biomedical fields as well as in the development of various types of biosensing devices. The richness in oxygen functional groups in the materials serves as a catalysis for the development of biosensors/electrochemical biosensors which promotes for an attachment of biological recognition elements, surface functionalization and compatible with micro- and nano-bio-environment. In this review, the graphene-based materials application in electrochemical biosensors based on recent advancement (e.g; the surface modification and analytical performances) and the utilization of such biosensors to monitor the noncommunicable diseases are presented. The detection performances of the graphene-based electrochemical biosensors are in the range of ng/mL and have reached up to fg/mL in detecting the targets of NCDs with higher selectivity, sensitivity and stability with good reproducibility attributes. We have discussed the advances while addressing the very specific biomarkers for the NCDs detection. Challenges and possible future research directions for the NCDs detection based on graphene nanocomposite with other 2D nanomaterials are outlined.									118	1	1	0	32	0	119			0956-5663	1873-4235		WOS:000461526200029	30771717

Herein, we develop a facile strategy to co-sensitize Ir-complex with Coumarins and boron dipyrromethene to explore photosensitizer with a broadband covering ca. 50% visible light region (Ir-4). This type of photosensitizer is firstly introduced into water splitting system, exhibiting significantly enhanced performance with over 21 times higher than that of typical Ir (ppy)(2)(bpy)(+), and the turnover number towards Ir-4 reaches to 115840, representing the most active sensitizer among reported molecular photocatalytic systems. Experimental and theoretical investigations reveal that the Ir-mediation not only achieves a long-lived boron dipyrromethene-localized triplet state, but also makes an efficient excitation energy transfer from Coumarin to boron dipyrromethene to trigger the electron transfer. These findings provide an insight for developing broadband and strong visible-light-absorbing multicomponent arrays on molecular level for efficient artificial photosynthesis.									69	5	0	0	2	0	69			2041-1723			WOS:000475833900002	31316076

Therefore, the development of modern corrosion-resistant materials and inhibitors by design is both technically and economically attractive. In the coming decades, industrial components will be engineered from molecular structures. This prospect provides the designer with a truly enormous range of choices in design, which is a situation that demands predictive tools that can link molecular structures with the final component performance. In particular, the development of alloys and inhibitors can replace the use of toxic compounds in protecting metal surfaces. To execute a tailored design programme, it is necessary to understand how corrosion and the associated processes occur from the molecular level to the component level and how the overall system behaviour emerges because of the inherent links among different scales. Therefore, in the present work, the literature on theoretical modelling of localised corrosion and related experimentation are reviewed from a multiscale viewpoint. The review addresses (a) the challenges in the theoretical formulation of the important phenomena that influence localised corrosion and (b) the hurdles facing computational methods. It is shown that (i) the existing models lack the resolution to design effective corrosion-resistant systems, (ii) the numerical strategies for linking the scales are in a state of evolution and (iii) there are gaps in the experimental characterisation of the corrosion system, particularly at the lower end of the scales. Suggestions are provided towards the construction of a multiscale model (MSM) for localised corrosion.									27	1	0	0	1	0	27			0950-6608	1743-2804		WOS:000331509900002

Because the processes at work are multielectronic, there is a crucial need for efficient and stable catalysts, which in addition have to be cheap for future industrial developments (electrolyzers, photoelectrochemicals, and fuel cells). Specifically for the water/hydrogen interconversion, Nature is an exquisite source of inspiration since this chemistry contributes to the bioenergetic metabolism of a number of living organisms via the activity of fascinating metalloenzymes, the hydrogenases.In this Account, we first briefly describe the structure of the unique dinuclear organometallic active sites of the two classes of hydrogenases as well as the complex protein machineries involved in their biosynthesis, their so-called maturation processes. This knowledge allows for the development of a fruitful bioinspired chemistry approach, which has already led to a number of interesting and original catalysts mimicking the natural active sites. More specifically, we describe our own attempts to prepare artificial hydrogenases. This can be achieved via the standard bioinspired approach using the combination of a synthetic bioinspired catalyst and a polypeptide scaffold. Such hybrid complexes provide the opportunity to optimize the system by manipulating both the catalyst through chemical synthesis and the protein component through mutagenesis.We also raise the possibility to reach such artificial systems via an original strategy based on mimicking the enzyme maturation pathways. This is illustrated in this Account by two examples developed in our laboratory. First, we show how the preparation of a lysozyme-{Mn-I(CO)(3)} hybrid and its clean reaction with a nickel complex led us to generate a new class of binuclear Ni-Mn H-2-evolving catalysts mimicking the active site of [NiFe]-hydrogenases. Then we describe how we were able to rationally design and prepare a hybrid system, displaying remarkable structural similarities to an [FeFe]-hydrogenase, and we show here for the first time that it is catalytically active for proton reduction. This system is based on the combination of HydF, a protein involved in the maturation of [FeFe]-hydrogenase (HydA), and a close mimic of the active site of this class of enzymes. Moreover, the synthetic [Fe-2(adt)(CO)(4)(CN)(2)](2-) (adt(2-) = aza-propanedithiol) mimic, alone or within a HydF hybrid system, was shown to be able to maturate and activate a form of HydA itself lacking its diiron active site. We discuss the exciting perspectives this "synthetic maturation" opens regarding the "invention" of novel hydrogenases by the chemists.									52	1	0	0	13	0	52			0001-4842	1520-4898		WOS:000359892700022	26165393

In this study, we identified genes encoding the extracellular and intracellular copper-zinc SODs (ecCuZnSOD and icCuZnSOD) and a manganese SOD (MnSOD) in the yellow mealworm beetle, Tenebrio molitor. The cDNAs for ecCuZnSOD, icCuZnSOD, and MnSOD, respectively, encode 24.55, 15.81, and 23.14 kDa polypeptides, which possess structural features typical of other insect SODs. They showed 20-94% identity to other known SOD sequences from Bombyx mori, Musca domestica, Nasonia vitripennis, Pediculus humanus corporis, and Tribolium castaneum. Expression of these genes was analyzed in selected tissues and developmental stages, and following exposure to Escherichia coli and parasitization by Scleroderma guani. We recorded expression of all three SODs in cuticle, fat body, and hemocytes and in the major developmental stages. Relatively higher expressions were detected in late-instar larvae and pupae, compared to other developmental stages. Transcriptional levels were upregulated following bacterial infection. Analysis of pupae parasitized by S. guani revealed that expression of T. molitor SOD genes was significantly induced following parasitization.

The only fractionation mechanism that is consistent with the data on all four sulfur isotopes involves atmospheric photochemical re actions such as SO2 photolysis. We. have used a one-dimensional photochemical model to investigate how the isotopic fractionation produced during SO2 photolysis would have been transferred to other gaseous and particulate sulfur-bearing species in, both low-O-2 and high-O-2 atmospheres. We show that in, atmospheres with O-2 concentrations <10(-5) times the present atmospheric level (PAL), sulfur-would have been removed from the atmosphere in a variety of different oxidation states, each of which would have had its own distinct isotopic signature. By. contrast, in atmospheres with O-2 concentrations &GE;10(-5) PAL, all sulfur-bearing species would have passed through the oceanic sulfate reservoir before being incorporated into sediments, so any signature of MIF would have been lost. We conclude that the atmospheric O-2 concentration must have been <10(-5) PAL prior to 2.3 Ga.									654	29	3	0	161	0	682			1531-1074			WOS:000182463400002	12449853	
J	Maun, MA								Adaptations of plants to burial in coastal sand dunes								CANADIAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY-REVUE CANADIENNE DE BOTANIQUE				76	5			713	738		10.1139/b98-058				MAY 1998	1998	One of the most obvious features on the foredunes and strands of coasts and lakes is recurrent burial in sand. Burial levels vary in different coastal sand dune systems and influence the physical and biotic microenvironment of the plant and soil. Foredune plants along coasts possess numerous adaptations to withstand burial. Studies show that below a certain threshold level of burial, the growth of all foredune plant species is stimulated probably because of multiple factors, namely improved soil resources, increase in soil volume, reactive plant growth, and enhanced mycorrhizal activity. However, as the level of burial increases, the positive response starts to decline until it becomes a negative value. For example, burial may reduce seed germination, seedling emergence, survival, and growth of seedlings and adult plants. At the community level, burial acts as a filter and selectively eliminates susceptible species, reduces the relative abundance of less tolerant species, and increases the abundance of tolerant and sand-dependent species. However, if sand deposition continues unabated, even the sand-dependent species are eliminated and a bare area is created. The emergence of a plant from a burial deposit primarily depends on the energy reserves in its storage organs and the speed, depth, and frequency of burial. Upon burial the plants shift resources from the belowground to the aboveground parts. Different plants show varied morphological responses to sand accretion. For example, the culms of grasses emerge by an increase in the number of nodes per culm and the elongation of internodes. Similarly, the emergent trunks and woody branches of tolerant trees and shrubs produce new buds and suckers at a higher level on the stem. In response to burial, the coastal sand dune species produce shootborne roots close Co the new soil surface probably because of decreased oxygen levels.									313	77	0	0	279	6	398			0008-4026			WOS:000076135800002

ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL				526	1			249	256		10.1086/307968				NOV 20 1999	1999	The majority of presolar circumstellar SiC and Al2O3 grains found in meteorites are inferred to have originated in asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars that were more metal-rich than the Sun despite being much older than the Sun. We test the suggestion of Clayton that this reflects the overwhelming diffusion of AGB stars from the more metal-rich inner Galaxy to the protosolar cloud. Weighting the orbital diffusion model of Wielen, Fuchs, & Dettbarn to take into account the higher density of AGE stars and molecular clouds in the inner Galaxy, we find that most parent stars of presolar grains should have diffused to the presolar cloud from their birthplaces at smaller Galactocentric radii. However, the majority of these stars are expected to have had subsolar metallicities, in conflict with the grain data. The self-consistency of the diffusion model is discussed in the context of stellar abundance data in the solar neighborhood. The disagreement between the model predictions and the observations might indicate that the inferred metallicities of presolar grain parent stars are wrong, that the adopted diffusion parameters are incorrect, and/or that stellar orbital diffusion is not the correct explanation for the grain data.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			0004-637X			WOS:000083863900020		
J	Qin, Jing; Lu, Ming-Xing; Zheng, Yu-Tao; Du, Yu-Zhou								Molecular Cloning, Characterization, and Functional Analysis of Catalase in Frankliniella occidentalis ( Thysanoptera: Thripidae)								ANNALS OF THE ENTOMOLOGICAL SOCIETY OF AMERICA				110	2			212	220		10.1093/aesa/saw075				MAR 2017	2017	Catalase is an important antioxidant enzyme that protects aerobic organisms from oxidative damage by degrading hydrogen peroxide to oxygen and water. In order to indicate the role of catalase in the thermotolerance of the western flower thrips, Frankliniella occidentalis (Pergande), a major pest of agricultural and horticultural crops, we cloned the cDNA encoding catalase from F. occidentalis in this study. Sequence analyses indicated that the catalase gene from F. occidentalis (FoCAT) encoded a protein containing 506 amino acids, including three catalytic amino acid residues (His-73, Asn-146, and Tyr-356), the proximal heme-ligand signature sequence, (62)FDRERIQERVVHAKGAG(78), and the proximal active site, (352)RIFSYADTH(360). Phylogenetic analysis indicated that CAT from different insect species could be grouped into a well-supported cluster that included Diptera, Lepidoptera, and Hemiptera. qRT-PCR analyses initially indicated that FoCAT expression was significantly up-regulated under heat and cold stress. When F. occidentalis nymphs were incubated at 37 or 6 degrees C, FoCAT expression showed a significant increase at 2h for both temperatures and then declined when the temperature duration was 4 or 8h. The enzymatic activity of FoCAT was significantly elevated at moderate heat stress (33 degrees C), but showed a significant decrease at-6 degrees C. When F. occidentalis nymphs were incubated at 37 or -6 degrees C, FoCAT activity showed a gradual decline for both temperatures and was lowest at the 8-h exposure time. In conclusion, FoCAT plays an important role in the thermotolerance of F. occidentalis, whichmay partially explain the widespread distribution of this important pest.									10	5	0	0	10	0	13			0013-8746	1938-2901		WOS:000398125800008

The prepared materials are characterized by X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, Fourier transform infrared spectra and UV-vis diffuse reflection spectra. The obtained results show that the co-catalysts Ni2P/Ni(PO3)(2) nanoparticles are dispersed on the surface of g-C3N4 nanosheets uniformly. The visible-light-driven photocatalytic hydrogen production rate is up to 508.3 mu mol h(-1) g(-1) with the assist of Pt cocatalyst, which is about 7 times and 5 times than pure g-C3N4 and Ni2P/Ni(PO3)(2), respectively. It is worth noting that the photocatalytic degradation ratio of chlorophenols is also up to 95%. The obtained photocatalysts are stable even after several cycles, which is favorable for practical applications. The excellent photocatalytic performance can be ascribed to the formation of heterojunctions and the synergistic effect of earth-rich cooperative catalyst (co-catalyst) Ni2P/Ni(PO3)(2) decorated the g-C3N4 promoting the efficient separation of photogenerated electron-hole pairs. The as-prepared novel heterojunction photo catalysts have potential applications in fields of energy and environment, and this work also opens new windows for fabricating other high-performance photocatalysts.

Pd-BaO nanoparticles were deposited on the TiO(2)surface by simple chemical reduction method using NaBH4 as reductant. The as-synthesized Pd-BaO/TiO2 photocatalysts showed a remarkably high performance in hydrogen production, approximately 29.6 mmol g(-1) h(-1) using an ethanol-water mixture (5% ethanol and 95% water), which is two times higher than Pd/TiO2 photocatalyst, where the latter is already regarded as the most active metal based TiO2 photocatalysts for H-2 production. This high hydrogen production efficiency was attributed to the inherent high catalytic activity of palladium nanoparticles and electronic promotional effect of BaO. The Ba (in the form of BaO) greatly enhanced the electron transfer from the semiconductor conduction band to Pd centers by raising the Fermi level of TiO2 during photo-irradiation. Most importantly, Pd is present exclusively in zero oxidation state, which is ideal for proton reduction in the as-prepared photocatalysts due to close proximity of highly electropositive BaO. The structural morphologies and mechanistic aspects of the Pd-BaO/TiO2 photocatalysts are addressed by using UV-Vis/DRS, XRD, TEM, and XPS characterization techniques.									11	0	0	0	0	0	11				2213-3437		WOS:000458768800001		
J	Wang, Guan-Nan; Zhang, Yong-Mei; Gu, Xue-Xiang; Peng, Yi-Wei; He, Yu								Petrogenesis and mineralization of the porphyry and skarn mineralization-related Husite intrusion in the Boluokenu metallogenic belt, Western Tianshan Orogenic Belt, NW China								JOURNAL OF ASIAN EARTH SCIENCES				165		SI		160	174		10.1016/j.jseaes.2018.05.011				OCT 1 2018	2018	Many porphyry and skarn Cu (Fe, Mo, Au, Zn) deposits have been discovered along the western Tianshar Orogenic Belt within the Central Asian Orogenic Belt. Generally, these Cu polymetallic deposits are considered tc be linked to porphyries that formed in an arc setting, e.g., in a continental magmatic arc and island magmati arc, but an agreement on their source region has not been reached. The Husite granitic complex and associatec Kekesala skarn Fe-Cu deposit from the Boluokenu metallogenic belt provide significant insights into a cornprehensive study of the ore-forming porphyries in Boluokenu. The ore-forming porphyries are mainly grano diorites and belong to calc-alkaline and high-K calc-alkaline series. LA-ICP-MS zircon U-Pb dating on tin granodiorites yields ages of 368 Ma. The trace element compositions of the granodiorites are characterized by enrichment in large ion lithophile elements (LILE) and light rare earth elements (LREE), depletion in high fielc strength elements (HFSE) and heavy rare earth elements (HREE), and slightly negative Eu anomalies and an similar to rocks that form in a continental arc setting. These rocks also show large variations in their epsilon(Hf)(t) (+4.7 to +9.7) and Mg# (38-69) values, alongside low Ba/Th (4-230) and high Th/Yb (3.77-7.41) and Th/Ls (0.21-0.71) ratios, suggesting that the granodiorite magma originated from the partial melting of mafic lowe; crust with a mantle wedge component and involved signals of subduction-zone sediments and fluids. The Husitt mafic microgranular enclaves (MMEs) exhibit high Mg# (50-62), MgO (3.25-6.93 wt%) and low SiO: (48.8-59.5%) contents, with positive em(t) from +3.3 to +7.4. The zircon LA-ICP-MS U-Pb ages of the MME (373 Ma) indicate nearly coeval formation between the MMEs and HMPs during the Late Devonian. Then features with the petrological and mineralogical characteristics (such as needle-like apatite and disequilibriun feldspar xenocrysts) suggest that the Husite MMEs formed from the mixing of felsic magma from the partia melting of mafic lower crust and mafic magma that was derived from mantle wedge, rather than restite, xenoliths or fractional crystallization of magma. Thus, the skarn Fe-Cu mineralization were probably related tc hybrid intermediate-acid magma that is characterized by high water and oxygen contents and high sulfur fugacity. It can be inferred that the response to ongoing slab roll-back during the Junggar plate's subductior beneath the Yili Block, including the underplating of mantle-derived mafic magmas from the metasomatism o subduction-zone melts, led to the partial melting of the mafic lower crust to form felsic magma. Then, tht continuous reaction between the mafic and felsic magmas further increased the Fe-Cu concentrations and wa; closely related to the subsequent Fe-Cu mineralization.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			1367-9120	1878-5786		WOS:000449447300010

One of the drawbacks of this method is the need for precious metalbased electrocatalysts. This calls for a highly efficient utilization of the precious metal, which can be obtained by dispersing the precious metal compound onto a catalyst support. Electrocatalysts with 50, 70 and 90 wt.% of IrO2 on a TaC support were tested in a laboratory PEM water electrolyser and compared with pure IrO2. The temperature was set at 90, 110, 120 and 130 degrees C respectively and the cell voltage was varied between 1.4 and 1.8 V. The load characteristics and electrochemical impedance spectra were obtained and compared for a range of electrocatalysts. The highest current densities and the lowest charge transfer and cell resistances were found for the 70 wt.% IrO2 electrocatalyst. By contrast, the pure IrO2 electrocatalyst showed the lowest current densities and the highest charge transfer and cell resistance. For example, the relative difference in current densities between the 70 wt.% IrO2 and the pure IrO2 electrocatalyst attained 36% at 130 degrees C and 1.7 V. All of the supported electrocatalysts showed a higher efficiency of utilization of the precious metal than the pure IrO2. Copyright (C) 2013, Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC.

It consists of a Mn4CaO5 cluster and Tyr(Z), a redox-active tyrosine residue. Chloride ions have been known for long time to be required for the function of the enzyme. However, X-ray data have shown that they are located about 7 angstrom away from the Mn4CaO5 cluster, a distance that seems too large to be compatible with a direct involvement of chloride in the water splitting chemistry. We have investigated the role of this anion by substituting I- for Cl- in the cyanobacterium Thermosynechococcus elongatus with either Ca2+ or Sr2+ biosynthetically assembled into the Mn-4 cluster. The electron transfer steps affected by the exchanges were investigated by time-resolved UV-visible absorption spectroscopy, time-resolved EPR at room temperature and low temperature cw-EPR spectroscopy. In both Ca-PSII and Sr-PSII, the Cl-/I- exchange considerably slowed down the two S(3)Tyr(Z)(center dot) -> (S(3)Tyr(Z)(center dot))' -> So reactions in which the fast phase, S(3)Tyr(Z)(center dot) -> (S(3)Tyr(Z)(center dot))', reflects the electrostatically triggered expulsion of one proton from the catalytic center caused by the positive charge near/on Tyr(Z)(center dot) and the slow phase corresponds to the S-0 and O-2 formations and to a second proton release. The t(1/2) for S-0 formation increased from 1.1 ms in Ca/Cl-PSII to approximate to 6 ms in Ca/I-PSII and from 4.8 ms in Sr/Cl-PSII to approximate to 45 ms in Sr/I-PSII. In all cases the Tyr(Z)(center dot) reduction was the limiting step. The kinetic effects are interpreted by a model in which the Ca2+ binding site and the Cl- binding site, although spatially distant, interact. This interaction is likely mediated by the H-bond and/or water molecules network(s) connecting the Cl- and Ca2+ binding sites by which proton release may be channelled. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

The prepared photocatalysts were characterized by SEM, TEM, XRD, UV-vis, PL, XPS and EIS. The photocatalytic performance of the as-prepared composite materials has been evaluated by the degradation of phenol under visible light irradiation.. About 98% phenol can be degraded within 150 min under visible light irritation, which was much higher than that of Ag3PO4/WO3 (80%), Ag/Ag3PO4 (55%), Ag3PO4 (50%), Ag/WO3(18%) and WO3(10%) in the same condition. The enhanced photocatlytic performance could be mainly attributed to the efficient electron transfer efficiency and photo-generated electron-hole pairs separation ability through the synergistic ability of Ag3PO4 and WO3 and the bridge of Ag nanoparticles. Moreover, quenching experiments show that h(+) and H2O2 are the two main active factors in the photocatalytic degradation process. Finally, a possible photocatalytic mechanism of the Ag/Ag3PO4/WO3 for the charge transfer process is proposed.									17	5	0	0	0	0	21			1293-2558	1873-3085		WOS:000487809800018

The phase transition from the semiconducting 2H-MoS2 to the metallic 1T-MoS2 is achieved by a hydrothermal exfoliation treatment. Experimental studies elucidate that the solar water splitting activity is greatly improved by forming 1T-MoS2 along with increasing S-vacancies because of the significantly enhanced surface plasmon resonance. The mixed-phase MoS2@TiO2 film shows a high H-2 yield rate of 308 mu mol h(-1) cm(-2) and long-term durability for 30 h, which is superior to the state-of-the-art catalysts for solar water splitting. This study offers a universal and efficient avenue to rationalize the plasmonic catalysts for solar water splitting and other energy and environmental applications.									25	1	0	0	0	0	25			2195-1071			WOS:000460336000010

The dunites include lenses of coarse- and medium-grained dunite set in a fine-grained dunite host. Disseminated chromite within these dunites can be classified into three microstructural types: (1) partly altered chromite with primary cores surrounded by porous chromite rims; (2) porous chromite with abundant pores that are filled with chlorite; and (3) homogeneous chromite. The primary magmatic cores of the partly altered chromite (Chr) is depleted in Cr and enriched in Al and Mg. Porous chromite includes Cr-rich Chr and ferritchromite (Fe-Chr) that is enriched in Fe2+ but depleted in Al. Homogeneous chromite is mainly Cr-magnetite (Cr-Mag) that is enriched in Fe3+ and extremely depleted in Al. The primary Cr-poor chromite was gradually transformed to porous Cr-rich Chr and/or by Fe-Chr during metamorphism. Reaction of Cr-poor Chr with olivine (Ol) produces chlorite (Chl) and secondary Chr enriched in Cr and Fe2+. Mg and Al diffuse away from primary Chr, leaving a residual Al- and Mg-depleted, Cr-rich Chr and Fe-Chr. Porous Chr is enriched in Zn, Co, Mn, but depleted in Ga, Ni, and Sc, due to the fluid-assisted formation of Chl within the pores of porous chromite. Zn, Co, and Mn from the metamorphic fluids diffuse toward the cores of chromite. The elements Sc, Ti, V, and Ni diffuse from Cr-poor Chr core to Cr-mag rim with increasing Fe3+/(Fe3+ + Fe2+). Late precipitation of Cr-mag occurred under oxidizing and hydrous conditions. The infiltration of fluid produced non-porous Fe3+-rich Chr or Cr-mag along grain boundaries or fractures within chromite. These fluids further promoted the reordering of octahedral sites, enhancing higher mobilization and enrichment of Ga, Ni, Sc, V, and Ti. The infiltration of high oxygen fugacity fluids promoted diffusion of Ga, Ni, Sc, and Ti toward the rims, and diffusion of Zn, Co, and Mn toward the cores. All chromite grains from the Songshugou dunites have low Mg-# [molar 100 x Mg/(Mg + Fe2+)] values, and high Cr-# [molar 100 x Cr/(Cr + Al)] and Fe3+/(Cr + Al + Fe3+), similar to metamorphic chromite formed under amphibolite-facies conditions. The observed positive Zn-Co-Mn anomalies and negative Ga-Ni-Sc anomalies in chromite, and the crystallization of Chl, are fingerprints of amphibolite-facies metamorphism. The compositions of chromite, the inferred mineral assemblage in which it occurs, and mineral equilibria modeling of the assemblage all suggest amphibolite-facies metamorphic temperatures ranging from 600 degrees C to 700 degrees C.

In this study, to understand the thermal behavior of the material, molecular dynamics was utilized to investigate the molecular structure, dynamic property, and mechanical behavior of NASH gel subjected to temperature elevation from 300 K to 1500 K. The aluminosilicate skeleton in NASH gel provides plenty of oxygen sites to accept H-bond from the invading water molecules. Upon heating, around 18.2% of water molecules are decomposed and produce silicate and aluminate hydroxyls. About 87% of hydroxyls are associated with the aluminate skeleton, which weakens the Al-O bonds and disturbs the O-Al-O angle and the local structure, transforming it from an aluminate tetrahedron to a pentahedron and octahedron. With increasing temperature, both Al-O-Si and Si-O-Si bonds are stretched to be broken and the network structure of the NASH gel is gradually transformed into a branch and chain structure. Furthermore, the self-diffusivity of water molecules and sodium dramatically increases with the elevation of temperature, because the decrease in connectivity of the aluminosilicate network reduces the chemical and geometric restriction on the water and ions in NASH gel under higher temperatures. The high temperature also contributes to around 63% of the water molecules further dissociating and hydroxyl groups forming; meanwhile proton exchange between the water molecules and aluminosilicate network frequently takes place. In addition, a uniaxial tensile test was utilized to study the mechanical behavior of the NASH gel at different temperatures. During the tensile test, the aluminosilicate network was found to depolymerize into a branch or chain structure which plays a critical role in resisting the tensile loading. In this process, the breakage of the aluminosilicate skeleton is accompanied with hydrolytic reactions that further deteriorate the structure. Due to the reduction of the chemical bond stability at elevated temperature, both the tensile strength and stiffness of the NASH gel are weakened significantly. However, the ductility of the NASH gel is improved because of the higher extent of structural arrangement at the yield stage and partly due to the lower water attack. Hopefully, the present study can provide valuable molecular insights on the design of alkali-activated materials with high sustainability and durability.									37	0	0	0	3	0	37			1463-9076	1463-9084		WOS:000442270800038	30062333

The electrodes were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), linear sweep voltammetry (ISV), and accelerated service life test. The Ti/Mn-Sb-SnO2 electrodes with 6 at.% Mn doped exhibited the best stability in accelerated service life test. The accelerated service life of Ti/Mn-Sb-SnO2 electrode was 7 times longer than that of Ti/Sb-SnO2 electrode. We also calculated the optimal geometry structure and bandstructure of Mn-doping SnO2 by using the first principle method, and the bandgap of SnO2 was narrowed after introducing Mn ion. The X-ray diffraction patterns (XRD) showed the deterioration of crystallinity and crystal lattice shrinkage with increasing in Mn-doping concentration. Furthermore, we provided some different coating models for preparing of Ti/Sb-X electrodes or other double dopants coating techniques. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

The nucleotide sequence of IS1542 was determined. It showed 81% homology with IS256 and contained an open reading frame sufficient to encode a 390 amino acid peptide predicted to have 87.2% identity with the transposase of IS256. By PCR, IS1542 was detected in the genomes of 26 of 28 (93%) VanA enterococci isolated from poultry in the UK and Ireland, but in only two of 65 (3%) glycopeptide-sensitive or VanC enterococci from hospital patients in the UK and Brazil. IS1542 may be a useful marker for evolutionary and epidemiological studies of VanA glycopeptide resistance in enterococci. (C) 1999 Federation of European Microbiological Societies.

C	Knuth, KH; Hajian, AR						Williams, CJ		Hierarchies of models: Toward understanding planetary nebulae								BAYESIAN INFERENCE AND MAXIMUM ENTROPY METHODS IN SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING		AIP CONFERENCE PROCEEDINGS		659				92	103						2003	2003	Stars like our sun (initial masses between 0.8 to 8 solar masses) end their lives as swollen red giants surrounded by cool extended atmospheres. The nuclear reactions in their cores create carbon, nitrogen and oxygen, which are transported by convection to the outer envelope of the stellar atmosphere. As the star finally collapses to become a white dwarf, this envelope is expelled from the star to form a planetary nebula (PN) rich in organic molecules. The physics, dynamics, and chemistry of these nebulae are poorly understood and have implications not only for our understanding of the stellar life cycle but also for organic astrochemistry and the creation of prebiotic molecules in interstellar space.We are working toward generating three-dimensional models of planetary nebulae (PNe), which include the size, orientation, shape, expansion rate and mass distribution of the nebula. Such a reconstruction of a PN is a challenging problem for several reasons. First, the data consist of images obtained over time from the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) and spectra obtained from Kitt Peak National Observatory (KPNO) and Cerro Tololo Inter-American Observatory (CTIO). These images are of course taken from a single viewpoint in space, which amounts to a very challenging tomographic reconstruction. Second, the fact that we have two disparate and orthogonal data types requires that we utilize a method that allows these data to be used together to obtain a solution. To address these first two challenges we employ Bayesian model estimation using a parameterized physical model that incorporates much prior information about the known physics of the PN.In our previous works we have found that the forward problem of the comprehensive model is extremely time consuming. To address this challenge, we explore the use of a set of hierarchical models, which allow us to estimate increasingly more detailed sets of model parameters. These hierarchical models of increasing complexity are akin to scientific theories of increasing sophistication, with each new model/theory being a refinement of a previous one by either incorporating additional prior information or by introducing a new set of parameters to model an entirely new phenomenon. We apply these models to both a simulated and a real ellipsoidal PN to initially estimate the position, angular size, and orientation of the nebula as a two-dimensional object and use these estimates to later examine its three-dimensional properties. The efficiency/accuracy tradeoffs of the techniques are studied to determine the advantages and disadvantages of employing a set of hierarchical models over a single comprehensive model.					22nd International Workshop on Bayesian Inference and Maximum Entropy Methods in Science and Engineering22nd International Workshop on Bayesian Inference and Maximum Entropy Methods in Science and Engineering	AUG 03-07, 2002AUG 03-07, 2002	Univ Idaho, Div Stat; Edwin T Jaynes Int Ctr Bayesian Methods & Maximum EntropyUniv Idaho, Div Stat; Edwin T Jaynes Int Ctr Bayesian Methods & Maximum Entropy	MOSCOW, IDMOSCOW, ID	1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0094-243X		0-7354-0119-5	WOS:000182322900007		
J	Schafer, G; Purschke, W; Schmidt, CL								On the origin of respiration: Electron transport proteins from archaea to man								FEMS MICROBIOLOGY REVIEWS				18	2-3			173	188		10.1016/0168-6445(96)00010-1				MAY 1996	1996	All aerobic organisms use the exergonic reduction of molecular oxygen to water as primary sourer of metabolic energy. This reaction is catalyzed by membrane residing terminal heme/Cu-oxidases which belong to a superfamily of widely varying structural complexity between mitochondrial and bacterial members of this family. Over the last few years, considerable information from this and other laboratories accumulated also on archaeal respiratory chains and their terminal oxidases. In the following, the molecular and catalytic properties of the latter are discussed and compared to those from bacteria and eucarya under the aspect of their energy conserving capabilities ar.d their phylogenetic relations. The Rieske iron-sulfur proteins being important functional constituents of energy transducing respiratory complexes are included in this study. A number of essential conclusions can be drawn. (1) Like bacteria; archaea can also contain split respiratory chains with parallel expression of separate terminal oxidases. (2) The functional core of all oxidases is the highly conserved topological motif of subunit I consisting of at least 12 membrane spanning helices with the 6 histidine residues of the heme/Cu-binding centers in identical locations. (3) Some archaeal oxidases are organized in unusual supercomplexes with other cytochromes and Rieske [2Fe2S] proteins. These complexes are likely to function as proton pumps, whereas on a structural basis several subunit I equivalents alone are postulated to be unable to pump protons. (4) The genes of two archaeal Rieske proteins have been cloned from Sulfolobus; phylogenetically they are forming a separate archaeal branch and suggest the existence of an evolutionary ancestor preceding the split into the three urkingdoms. (5) Archaeal oxidase complexes may combine features of electron transport systems occurring exclusively as separate respiratory complexes in bacteria and eucarya. () As far back as the deepest branches of the phylogentic tree, terminal oxidases reveal a degree of complexity comparable to that found in higher organisms. (7) Sequence analysis suggests a monophyletic origin of terminal oxidases with an early split into two types found in archaea as well as bacteria. This view implies an origin of terminal oxidases prior to oxygenic photosynthesis in contrast to the widely accepted inverse hypothesis.					1st International Congress on Extremophiles1st International Congress on Extremophiles	JUN 02-06, 1996JUN 02-06, 1996		ESTORIL, PORTUGALESTORIL, PORTUGAL	58	0	0	0	43	0	59			0168-6445	1574-6976		WOS:A1996UN34100008	8639327

We report a genomic exploration of globin genes in this non-model organism. Applying a PCR based strategy with a strict criterion of phylogenetically informative sites we estimate the number of linked beta and alpha globin genes. We estimate PCR error rate by PCR of cloned DNA and recloning and by analysis of singleton variable sites among clones. Based on the error rate we exclude variable sites so that the remaining variation meets successively stricter criteria of doubleton and triplet variable site. Applying these criteria we find ten clusters of linked beta/alpha globin genes in the genome of Atlantic cod. Six variable amino acid changes in both genes were found in linkage disequilibrium with silent nucleotide substitutions. A phylogenetic tree, based on our strictly phylogenetically informative sites among 57 clones from 19 individuals, is split into two major branches by an amino acid change in a beta gene. This change is supported by extensive linkage disequilibrium between the amino acid change and numerous other phylogenetically informative silent nucleotide sites. The different gene sets in the genome may represent different loci encoding different globins and/or allelic variation at some loci. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

This topographic configuration leads to a monsoon redistribution which resulted in an arid rift floor and humid high rainfall highlands. The rifting and associated volcanism also caused a thinning of the crust and facilitates influx of CO2 and other mantle gases as diffuse sources or along faults from deeper sources. Groundwaters in the rift floor are usually of high mineral content (high F, U, As and salinity) while those on the plateau are of low mineral content. Among many factors, groundwater availability and quality in the rift floor aquifers is the function of their connection to the aquifers in the high rainfall plateau and the residence time of groundwater prior to reaching the rift floor. This entails the need for addressing one basic hydrologic question in such a setting: at what depth and rate does recharge from the high rainfall highland reach the lowland rift aquifers? This study uses spatial variations in trace elements and relates them to C-14 variations, thereby investigating the suitability of using trace elements as proxies for residence time estimation of groundwaters of relatively short (1,000-2,000 years) residence time. This work also investigates the behavior of trace element trends along the groundwater flow path in a rifted setting and compares them with such trends in sedimentary aquifers elsewhere. The comparison shows a clear difference in behavior of trace elements along the groundwater flow path when compared with such variations in big sedimentary basins with no prominent rifting and volcanism, suggesting the need of calibrating the relation between trace elements and any direct residence time indicators. An integrated use of major elements, trace elements, and environmental isotopes reveals that the main recharge of the aquifers originates from mountain blocks and that recharge takes place via fractures with no evidence of evaporation prior to recharge. Redox processes appear to play a limited role in trace element geochemistry of groundwaters in the region. Progressive trends in trace element composition along the groundwater flow path suggest continuous groundwater flow from the plateau.									12	0	0	0	3	0	12			1866-6280	1866-6299		WOS:000283303800008

Here, we used the periodic density functional theory simulations to engineer the electronic band structure, charge separation efficiency, as well as the photocatalytic properties of g-C3N4 and B4C3 based two-dimensional van der Waals heterojunctions. The effect of strain on the band edge energy and band structure was investigated in detail. The effective mass of electrons (m(e)*/m(o) = 0.76) and holes (m(h)*/m(o) = 1.16) in the B4C3/g-C3N4 heterojunction predicted a superior mobility than in isolated g-C3N4 monolayer (m(e)* = 0.98; m(h)* = 1.34). The Delta G(H*) value (-0.10 eV) of the atomic hydrogen on B4C3/g-C3N4 heterojunction confirmed the superior HER performance in contrast to isolated g-C3N4 (Delta G(H*) = 0.108 eV) and B4C3 (Delta G(H*) = -0.22 eV) monolayers. Our study offers possibilities to produce a novel B4C3/g-C3N4 heterojunction for the photocatalytic water splitting and optoelectrical applications.									25	1	0	0	1	0	25			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000564572500009

There, the as-prepared Mo2C/CdMoO4/CdS composite exhibits a remarkable photocatalytic HER enhancement of about similar to 50 folds than that of pure CdS and a decent photocatalytic stability, which can be mainly ascribed to that, the Mo2C with lower Fermi level can capture-diffuse the photoelectron to water quickly and decrease the photocorrosion, the CdMoO4 transition layer can promote the charge carriers transport, the 3D hollow structure can improve the HER active sites, solar efficiency and structure stability, and can be proved by the electrochemical measurements.									8	0	0	0	0	0	8			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000516818700080

Traditional methods for degradation assessment, such as chronoamperometry or electrolyte/electrode post-analysis, provide limited information on the degradation mechanisms and kinetics. To address this issue, a new setup, which is based on a light source, an electrochemical cell, and an on-line inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer (ICP-MS), has been developed. The first results on the photocorrosion of a commercial WO3 powder on Au are demonstrated in this work. It is shown that, in the absence of light, WO3 is stable in a wide potential range. On the other hand, in the presence of light, it dissolves proportionally to the anodic photocurrent. The latter is explained by the formation of aqueous tungsten complexes with the electrolyte that are thermodynamically more stable than WO3 . As can be anticipated from these initial results, the novel method will enable the characterization of a wide range of photoelectrochemical materials, and thus eventually lead to the development of long-term stable devices.									21	0	0	0	2	0	21			1388-2481	1873-1902		WOS:000448403200011

Although different atomic catalysts have been developed, the introduction of main group elements is rarely considered. In this work, the possibility of introducing alkaline/alkaline earth metals (AAEM), post-transition metal (Post-TM), and metalloids to form stable graphdiyne-based dual atomic catalysts (GDY-DAC) is revealed. The main group elements not only act as a promising separator to improve the loading of DACs but also activate the alkyl chains to facilitate the electroactivity of GDY-DAC. Most importantly, the main group elements in the GDY-DAC do not affect the electroactivity of transition or lanthanide metals and even enable subtle modulations on the electronic structures. The p band center is a significant descriptor to modulate the electroactivity in oxides while their applications in the atomic catalysts are unclear. With the further evaluations of machine learning, it is found that the involvements of s-orbitals and p-orbitals perturb the prediction accuracies of both formation energies and p-band center, especially for the AAEM. This work supplies insights that are expected to aid progress in designing main group elements-based atomic catalysts, which opens a new avenue in designing advanced electrocatalysts.									14	2	0	0	0	0	15			1614-6832	1614-6840		WOS:000663377200001

Herein, we report an asymmetric electrolyzer with three-dimensional (3D) Ni2P nanorod networks as bifunctional electrocatalysts for acidic cathode and alkaline anode that are separated by a bipolar membrane; this type of electrolyzer affords us with optimization in decreasing the energy required and maximizing the electrocatalysts: (1) pH gradient between an anolyte and a catholyte separated by a bipolar membrane provides the electrolyzer with additional electrochemical neutralization energy for facilitating water splitting and (2) efficiency of electrocatalysts can be maximized by offsetting the well-known mismatch of optimal conditions for electrocatalysts between the anode (normally alkaline) and the cathode (generally acidic). This unprecedented water electrolysis system can activate water splitting at an applied voltage of around 0.79V that is significantly lower than the minimum theoretical voltage requirement (1.23 V), reducing electricity energy consumed by more than 35.8%.									70	5	0	0	4	0	70			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000428089500003

These, together with the delta(34)S values of coeval marine sulfates, are used to examine the global cycling of carbon and sulfur. It is generally accepted that secular variation in delta(13)C and delta(34)S values of marine carbonates and sulfates is controlled by balanced oxidation-reduction reactions and that their long-term, steady-state variation can be predicted from the present-day isotopic fractionation ratio (Delta(C)/Delta(S)) the ratio of the riverine flux of sulfur and carbon (F-S/F-C). The predicted slope of the linear relation between delta(13)C(carb) and delta(34)S(sulfate) values is approximately -0.10 to -0.14. However, temporal variation observed in marine cement delta(13)C values and the delta(34)S values of coeval marine sulfates produces a highly significant linear relation (r(2) = 0.80; alpha > 95%) with a slope of -0.24; approximately twice the predicted value. This discordance suggests that either the Phanerozoic average riverine F-S/F-C was 1.6-3.3 times greater than today's estimates or that an additional source of S-34-depleted sulfur or C-13-enriched carbon, other than continental reservoirs, was active during the Phanerozoic. This new relation between marine delta(13)C and S34S values suggests that the flux of reduced sulfur, iron, and manganese from seafloor hydrothermal systems affects oceanic O-2 levels which, in turn, control the oxidation or burial of organic matter, and thus the delta(13)C value of marine DIG. Therefore, the sulfur system (driven by seafloor hydrothermal systems) controls the carbon system rather than organic carbon burial controlling the response of delta(34)S values (via formation of sedimentary pyrite).Secular variation of marine Sr-87/Sr-86 ratios and delta(18)O values argues for a coupling of delta(13)C and delta(34)S values to variation in the relative contribution of seafloor hydrothermal and continental weathering fluxes. These trends indicate that the early Paleozoic was dominated by low temperature silicate weathering, whereas the Late Paleozoic to Modern was dominated by high temperature seawater-basalt interactions. Variation in Proterozoic delta(13)C(carb) and delta(34)S(sulfate) values produces a slope that is greater than that of the Phanerozoic (-0.50 vs. -0.24). This steeper slope is consistent with other geochemical data that indicate relatively high seafloor hydrothermal fluxes during the late Precambrian. We speculate that the dramatic evolutionary changes of the Neoproterozoic-Paleozoic transition occur during a waning of seafloor hydrothermal fluxes and a concomitant decrease in O-2 consumption that permitted the oxygenation of seawater thought to be critical in metazoan evolution.

Stability is one of the main properties of these anodes because of their high cost. Morphology of mixed metal oxide coating is a determining factor in electrochemical stability of mentioned anodes. In this article the effect of temperature and times of heat treatment on the morphology and electrochemical stability of Ti/(Ti0.1Ru0.2Sn0.7)O-2 anode has been investigated. The anodes were prepared by brushing and thermal decomposition method. Mud cracked morphology appeared on the sample by this process. Increasing the temperature of calcination causes the density of cracks on the surface and electrochemical stability of coating to decrease. Increasing the time had different effects in the first and final calcination times. The anode which was prepared at 450 degrees C, for 10 min in the first calcination time and 1 h in the final calcination time had the highest stability and optimum morphology.									10	1	0	0	1	0	10			1478-422X	1743-2782		WOS:000270649800008

It exhibited an ultralow overpotential of 250 and 108 mV to achieve the current density of 50 and 10 mA cm(-2), along with the relatively small Tafel slope of 41.28 and 72.89 mV dec(-1) for OER and HER in 1 M KOH, respectively. It is superior to other multimetallic-MOF-74 composites at the same condition and also surpasses the benchmark of commercial noble-metal catalysts as well. As a result, a low cell voltage of ca. 1.62 V was obtained at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2), when tetrametallic FeCoMnNi-MOF-74/NF is employed as both anode and cathode electrodes for the real water splitting. The present work potentially provides a new insight into prospecting and designing multivariate MOFs as a promising material for efficient electrocatalysis in the practical application.									17	1	0	0	0	0	18			0020-1669	1520-510X		WOS:000584351700082	32991151

Structure and morphology of this product are analyzed by using spectroscopic and microscopic techniques. As-prepared CoPDA along with added reduced graphene oxide (r-GO) is explored for the electrochemical detection of L-histidine (L-His) under optimized condition. The electrochemical response of CoPDA/r-GO composite coated onto glassy carbon electrode toward the oxidation of L-His shows a linear response over a wide concentration range with a sensitivity of 4.47 mu A/mM. The limit of detection value is calculated to be 1.5 mu M with a response time of 17 seconds. The proposed sensor matrix is found to be highly selective for L-His among other interfering amino acids. Real sample analysis is carried out for the estimation of L-His using commercial L-His supplements. These studies suggest the promising use of this proposed electrochemical sensor for efficient detection of L-His possessing better selectivity and sensitivity.

Here, this work demonstrated that bauxite residue could be reused as a superior cathode for heterogeneous electro-Fenton (EF) process to degrade organic pollutants. With bauxite residue and straw as raw materials, a Fe-C-N contained catalyst was successfully prepared via a pyrolysis route in the presence of urea. This Fe-C-N contained catalyst exhibited promising electrocatalytic performance to reduce O-2 to produce H2O2 and activate H2O2 to generate (OH)-O-center dot simultaneously. As a heterogeneous EF cathode, 97% of rhodamine B (10 mg L-1) could be degraded within 45 min at pH 3 with a catalyst dosage of 0.2 mg mL(-1), which was comparable to those reported advanced EF cathodes. The appropriate reduction of Fe-contained minerals and carbonization of straw with N doping were attributed to the superior catalytic properties. Thus, the current study provides a feasible strategy to reuse bauxite residue and upgrade them into value-added electrode material. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

Optimum efficiency of iridium oxide deposition was obtained by cycling the potentials (100 mV s(-1)) between -0.7 V and 1.0 V vs. SCE. The SEM analysis reveals that the iridium oxide is uniformly distributed on the entire electrode surface with particles having a globular form. All particles, appear isolated or in aggregated structures with an average diameter comprised between 0.03 mu m and 0.4 mu m. The XPS curve fitting analysis reveals that the surface deposit is formed of hydrated Ir(III) and Ir(IV) oxyhydroxide species. The electrocatalytic activity of the GC/IrOx electrode toward the oxidation of semicarbazide under acidic condition (i.e., 50 mM HClO4) using cyclic voltammetry and chronoamperometry, was also investigated.

Crucial determinants of electrocatalytic activity were investigated for a cobalt-based oxide film electrodeposited at various thicknesses on inert electrodes. For water oxidation at low current densities, the turnover frequency (TOF) per cobalt ion of the bulk material stayed fully constant for variation of the thickness of the oxide film by a factor of 100 (from about 15nm to 1.5m). Thickness variation changed neither the nanostructure of the outer film surface nor the atomic structure of the oxide catalyst significantly. These findings imply catalytic activity of the bulk hydrated oxide material. Nonclassical dependence on pH was observed. For buffered electrolytes with pK(a) values of the buffer base ranging from 4.7 (acetate) to 10.3 (hydrogen carbonate), the catalytic activity reflected the protonation state of the buffer base in the electrolyte solution directly and not the intrinsic catalytic properties of the oxide itself. It is proposed that catalysis of water oxidation occurs within the bulk hydrated oxide film at the margins of cobalt oxide fragments of molecular dimensions. At high current densities, the availability of a proton-accepting base at the catalyst-electrolyte interface controls the rate of water oxidation. The reported findings may be of general relevance for water oxidation catalyzed at moderate pH by amorphous transition-metal oxides.									150	1	0	0	20	0	151			1864-5631	1864-564X		WOS:000336249400009	24449514

(3)He/(4)He ratios of the samples (R) normalized to the atmospheric (3)He/(4)He ratio (R(A) = 1.39 x 10(-6)) range from 0.27 to 1.67 and are significantly higher than the crustal production value of 0.05. Fluids with relatively high R/R(A) values are generally found in areas of significant heat potential (Kizildere and Tuzla fields). CO(2)/(3)He ratios of the samples, ranging from 1.6 x 10(9) to 2.3 x 10(14), display significant variation and are mostly higher than values typical of an upper mantle source (2 X 109). The delta(13)C (CO(2)) and delta(13)C (CH(4)) values of all fluids vary from -8.04 to +0.35 parts per thousand and -25.80 to -23.92 parts per thousand (vs. PDB), respectively. Stable isotope values (delta(18)O-delta D) of the geothermal waters are conformable with the Mediterranean Meteoric Water Line and indicate a meteoric origin. The temperatures calculated by gas geothermometry are significantly higher than estimates from chemical geothermometers, implying that either equilibrium has not been attained for the isotope exchange reaction or that isotopic equilibration was disturbed due to gas additions en route to the surface. Evaluation of He-CO(2) abundances indicates that hydrothermal degassing and calcite precipitation (controlled probably by adiabatic cooling due to degassing) significantly fractionate the elemental ratio (CO(2)/(3)He) in geothermal waters. Such processes do not affect gas phase samples to anywhere near the same extent. For the gas samples, mixing between mantle and various crustal sources appears to be the main control on the observed He-C systematics: however, crustal inputs dominate the CO(2) inventory. Considering that limestone is the main source of carbon (similar to 70 to 97% of the total carbon inventory), the carbon flux from the crust is found to be at least 20 times that from the mantle. As to the He-inventory, the mantle-derived component is found to vary up to 21% of the total He content and is probably transferred to the crust by fluids degassed from deep mantle melts generated in association with the elevated geotherm and adiabatic melting accompanying current extension. The range of (3)He/enthalpy ratios (0.000032 to 0.19 x 10(-12) cm(3) STP/J) of fluids in western Anatolia is consistent with the release of both helium and heat from contemporary additions of mantle-derived magmas to the crust. The deep faults appear to have facilitated the deep circulation of the fluids and the transport of mantle volatiles and heat to the surface. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V.

J	Johnson, RE; Liu, M								Sputtering of the atmosphere of Mars - 1. Collisional dissociation of CO2								JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-PLANETS				103	E2			3639	3647		10.1029/97JE03265				FEB 25 1998	1998	Ejection of atoms and molecules from the atmosphere of Mars is caused by energetic O+ pickup-ion bombardment [Luhmann et al., 1992; Jakosky et al., 1994], a process referred to as atmospheric sputtering. In an atmosphere which is primarily a mix of O and CO2 collisional dissociation of CO2 may have a large effect on the sputtering efficiency [Kass and Yung, 1995, 1996]. In this paper, we calculate dissociation cross sections for O + CO2, O + CO, CO + CO2, and CO2 + CO2 collisions in the energy range 20 eV to 1 keV. Semiempirical interaction potentials are used from which cross sections are calculated via classical molecular dynamics. The O + CO2 dissociation cross sections and the energy transfer to the fragments are compared to that calculated using the binary encounter approximation (BEA) [e.g., Sieveka and Johnson, 1984] and to the dissociation cross section model used by Kass and Yung [1995] in their calculation of atmospheric loss from Mars. The former are useful well above the dissociation threshold energy, whereas the latter significantly overestimate dissociation at all energies. Modifications of the BEA model for atom-molecule collisions and that of Kass and Yung for molecular-molecular collisions are suggested. The cross sections created here will be used in a Monte Carlo calculation bf the atmospheric sputtering rate.									15	0	0	0	0	0	15			2169-9097	2169-9100		WOS:000074140900001

In this study, hapR sequences from 85 V. cholerae strains belonging to both pandemic and nonpandemic serogroup were investigated through phylogenetic and sequence analyses. Biofilm formation assays under aerobic and anaerobic conditions were also performed. Sequence variations include single point mutations and insertions/ deletions (indels) leading to either truncated or frameshifted HapR. Population structure analysis revealed two major hapR haplogroups, hapR1 and hapR2 Phylogenetic reconstruction displayed a hypothetical ancestral hapR sequence located within the hapR1 haplogroup. Higher numbers of single nucleotide polymorphisms and genetic diversity indices were observed in hapR1, while indels occurred dominantly in hapR2. Aerobic conditions supported more robust biofilms compared to anaerobic conditions. Strains with frame-shifted HapR produced the largest amount of biofilm under both oxygen conditions. Quantitative real-time PCR assay confirmed that strains with truncated and frame-shifted HapR resulted in a nonfunctional regulator as exhibited by the significantly low hapA gene expression. The present study shows that HapR mutations had a strong influence on biofilm formation and that sequence polymorphisms leading to the disruption of DNA-binding sites or dimerization of the HapR will result in more-robust V. cholerae biofilms.IMPORTANCE Our study revealed an ancestral hapR sequence from a phylogenetic reconstruction that displayed the evolutionary lineage of the nonpandemic to the pandemic strains. Here, we established hapR1 and hapR2 as major hapR haplogroups. The association of the 01 and 0139 serogroups with the hapR2 haplogroup demonstrated the distinction of hapR2 in causing cholera infection. Moreover, mutations in this regulator that could lead to the disruption of transcription factor-binding sites or dimerization of the HapR can significantly affect the biofilm formation of V. cholerae. These observations on the relationship of the hapR polymorphism and V. cholerae biofilm formation will provide additional considerations for future biofilm studies and insights into the epidemiology of the pathogen that could ultimately help in the surveillance and mitigation of future cholera disease outbreaks.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0099-2240	1098-5336		WOS:000841051700001	35969071

In this study, a novel mixed-metallic MOF [Ag4Co2(pyz)PDC4][Ag2Co(pyz)(2)PDC2] was synthesized, and it transformed into Ag doped Co3O4 catalyst, which exhibits excellent electro-catalytic performance for reduction of CO2 in water to syngas (H-2 + CO). The as-prepared Ag/Co3O4 material exhibits a high selectivity of CO in 0.1 M KHCO3 aqueous solution (CO2 saturated) with the corresponding faradaic efficiency up to 55.6%. Compared with the Ag/Co3O4 electrode, the maximum faradaic efficiency (FE) of CO of pure Co3O4 is 21.3% at -1.8 V vs. SCE. The results show that the presence of Ag can improve the efficiency of CO significantly, thereby inhibiting the production of H-2. The stability of the samples can be maintained for more than 10 h at -1.8 V vs. SCE. The ratio of production between H-2 and CO can be controlled by varying the potential values.									24	5	0	0	2	0	25			0022-4596	1095-726X		WOS:000433525000007

Here, a facile and rapid three-step approach is reported to simultaneously reduce these recombinations for hematite nanorods (NRs) array photoanode, leading to a greatly improved photocurrent density at low bias potential. First, flame-doping enables high concentration of Ti doping without hampering the morphology and surface properties of the hematite NRs, which reduces both the bulk and surface recombinations effectively. Second, the addition of a dense-layer between the hematite NRs and fluorine-doped SnO2 substrate effectively reduces the interfacial recombination by suppressing the electron back-injection into electrolyte. Finally, the sequential oxalic acid etching and FeOOH deposition improves both the interface quality between FeOOH electrocatalyst and hematite NRs and the surface catalytic activity. Significantly, the combination of flame-doping, dense-layer deposition, surface etching, and electrocatalyst deposition effectively reduces the multiple electron/hole recombination pathways in a hematite NRs photoanode, which decreases the photocurrent onset potential from 1.02 V-RHE to 0.64 V-RHE, a reduction of 380 mV.									130	9	0	0	6	1	131			1614-6832	1614-6840		WOS:000371147000011

However, how to choose proper cocatalysts in certain photo catalytic system is still a challenging question. In this work, the first-principles density functional theory is employed to explore two photocatalysts with different photocatalytic activity, CoOx and NiOx loaded Ta3N5, including finding the stable structure of metal oxide adsorbed surface, analyzing the electronic properties, and investigating the behavior of water adsorption. Our results indicate that the structural match between cluster and surface and less distortion of interfacial structure are benefit to the stability of the whole system. Water dissociation tends to occur at the interface between metal oxide cluster and Ta3N5 surface. Combining observations in experiments with our calculated.results, we propose that the obvious difference of photocatalytic activities in CoOx/Ta3N5 and NiOx/Ta3N5 is possibly related to whether there are impurity states located in the middle of band gap, which has adverse effect on the separation of photo-generated electrons and holes.

With best commercial Ir catalyst loading of 1.5 mg cm(-2) Ir at the anode, the cell's current densities of 1346 mA cm-2, 1820 mA cm(-2) and 2250 mA cm(-2) were achieved at the cell potentials of 1.80 V, 1.90 V and 2.00 V, respectively, A PEMWE with 0.3 mg cm(-2) Ir loading of Ir/TiC anode catalyst was comparatively stable and gave current densities of 840 mA cm(-2), 1130 mA cm(-2) and 1463 mA cm(-2) at the cell potentials of 1.80 V, 1.90 V and 2.00 V, respectively.

J	Farid, Intissar; Zouari, Kamel; Rigane, Adel; Beji, Ridha								Origin of the groundwater salinity and geochemical processes in detrital and carbonate aquifers: Case of Chougafiya basin (Central Tunisia)								JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY				530				508	532		10.1016/j.jhydrol.2015.10.009				NOV 2015	2015	Comprehensive investigations of groundwaters were performed in the detrital and carbonate aquifers of the Chougafiya basin, central Tunisia. In the present review, hydrochemistry and isotopic tools were combined to get an insight into the processes controlling mineralization, recharge conditions, flow pattern of groundwater and C chemistry in the investigated hydrological system.Analysis of the dissolved constituents revealed that several processes controlled the observed chemical composition: (i) the dissolution of evaporitic minerals, (ii) cation exchange reactions, (iii) sulfate reduction under anaerobic conditions, (iv) incongruent dissolution of carbonate minerals (calcite, dolomite) coupled with gypsum dissolution and calcite precipitation, and (v) silicates weathering.Data inferred from O-18 and deuterium isotopes in groundwater samples indicated recharge with modern rainfall. Water characterized by lower delta O-18 and delta H-2 values is interpreted as recharged by non-evaporated rainfall originating from Mediterranean and Atlantic air masses. However, water with relatively enriched delta O-18 and delta H-2 contents is thought to reflect the occurrence of an evaporation process related to the long term practice of flood irrigation.The radiogenic (H-3) isotope data provided insight into the presence of two recharge periods in the investigated groundwaters. Waters with H-3 contents of <1 TU indicated a pre-nuclear recharge. Waters with H-3 contents of >1 TU clearly suggested the occurrence of a contemporaneous recharge probably during the last two decades.Carbon isotopes provided some insights into the timescales of groundwater flow, but mainly revealed that main sources of C are active in the system. These are likely: dissolved biogenic CO2, carbonate dissolution and incongruent reaction of the carbonate matrix. Mean residence times were determined after correction of the initial activities for dead C from the rock matrix and suggest ages ranging from the present day to the Holocene in both Upper Cretaceous and Mio-pliocene groundwaters.

One of the milestones of the material design was the integration of a microporous layer (MPL) on sintered titanium PTLs. Utilizing high-resolution neutron imaging, the water and gas distribution in the multi-layered porous transport media (ML-PTL) was probed at various current densities (up to 4 A cm(-2)) and pressure conditions up to 8 bar, using a series of four materials, differing in MPL morphology. The water and gas distribution measured is greatly affected by the presence of an MPL. While in the bulk of the PTL, the gas accumulation is increased in the presence of an MPL, in the MPL itself more water is retained. The finer the MPL structure, the higher the liquid saturation. It is observed that the two-phase flow in the MPL has minor influence on the performance of the cell even though the gas accumulation at the CL interface is greatly reduced. The improvements, therefore, appear to be related to the CL and MPL interaction on sub-micron scale and microstructure effect on catalyst area utilization.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			0013-4651	1945-7111		WOS:000610087400001

In this research, an earth-abundant CoFe layered double hydroxide was prepared with a simple one-step hydrothermal method and was employed as a promising catalyst for electrochemical ammonia synthesis. The CoFe double hydroxide exhibited excellent catalytic activity with a high generation rate of 1.1 x 10(-9) mol s(-1) cm(-2) in a single-chamber cell, and a high Faradaic efficiency of 14.18% was obtained when the concentration of protons and electrons was limited in a double-chamber cell. The outstanding catalytic performance of CoFe layered double hydroxide was attributed to the abundant N-2 adsorption sites provided by the binder-free three-dimensional nano-structure and the synergy between the Co and Fe atoms in the layer.

C	Tazi, B; Savadogo, O						Savadogo, O; Roberge, PR		New cation exchange membranes based on Nafion, silicotungstic acid and thiophene								NEW MATERIALS FOR FUEL CELL AND MODERN BATTERY SYSTEMS II								864	871						1997	1997	A new cation exchange membrane based on Nafion(R) and silicotungstic acid with and without thiophene (NASTA1 and NASTATH11) was prepared for solid polymer electrolyte fuel cells and other electrochemical systems. Several membranes of different thicknesses (15 mu m to 500 mu m) were synthesized. The water contents of the membranes were determined. These water contents for membranes fabricated with Nafion(R) 117, silicotungstic acid and thiophene (NASTATHI), are similar to those of Nafion(R) 117. However, the water contents of the membranes fabricated with Nafion(R) 117 and silicotungstic acid (NASTATHI) are surprisingly high compared to those of Nafion(R) 117. The ionic conductivities of several membranes were measured. The ionic conductivities of NASTAI and NASTATHI in a 2 M NaCl solution at 25 degrees C are, at least, twice as high as that of the Nafion(R) 117. The membranes were characterized by chemical stability studies, atomic force microscopy (AFM) and X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS). The membranes fabricated with Nafion, and STA with and without thiophene still exhibited good mechanical strength and stability after dipping in an acid or a basic medium for at least two months.					2nd International Symposium on New Materials for Fuel Cell and Modern Battery Systems2nd International Symposium on New Materials for Fuel Cell and Modern Battery Systems	JUL 06-10, 1997JUL 06-10, 1997	Ecole Polytech Montreal, Dept Met & Genie Materiaux; Quebec Minist Energy & ResourcesEcole Polytech Montreal, Dept Met & Genie Materiaux; Quebec Minist Energy & Resources	MONTREAL, CANADAMONTREAL, CANADA	6	1	0	0	0	0	6					2-553-00624-1	WOS:000079562400080

The combination of experimental and computational approaches can provide insights into the inner laws between the catalytic performance and the structural and electronic properties of catalysts. Owing to the inherent advantages of 2D materials over their 3D counterparts, including high specific surface area and abundant surface defects that could provide sufficient active sites, 2D materials are promising candidates and have attracted wide interest in catalysis. Importantly, 2D materials are the most widely computationally investigated models with which to relate computational prediction with experimental confirmation conveniently. Recently, more 2D catalysts have been prepared in experiments while more accurate computational methods have been used to disclose catalytic performance, and explore the mechanism at an atomic level. In this review, recent advances are summarized related to the development and design of 2D electro/photocatalysts. The main emphasis is put on the unique properties of 2D catalysts investigated by the combination of experiments and computations. Computational methods closer to experimental environments are introduced with particular attention to bridge the gap between experiments and computations. In addition, the challenges of computations and experiments are also discussed for 2D catalysts.									56	3	0	0	1	0	56			1614-6832	1614-6840		WOS:000620238200001

However, pristine PCN is unable to cope with the growing varieties of applications. Making PCN more adaptive to evolving conditions is one of the greatest challenges. Molecular engineering strategy proves to be a powerful tool to modify PCN with specified purpose, revealing that what is really appealing on PCN is its structural and electronic adjustability. By tuning the molecular structure of PCN, the in-plane electronic environment is accordingly changed, hence improving its photocatalytic activity. Herein, to further understand the relationship between the molecular structure of PCN and its photocatalytic performance, a comprehensive review on the recent progress of molecular engineering on PCN photocatalysts is presented. After introducing the fundamental properties of PCN and typical molecular engineering methodologies, the effects of different approaches of molecular structure modifications on the electronic structure of PCN are discussed in detail to unveil the role of molecular structures in electronic configuration regulation and the resultant photocatalytic performance. Finally, design principles of efficient PCN photocatalysts based on molecular engineering are provided, facilitating the understanding of its photocatalysis mechanism on the electronic level.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2367-198X			WOS:000714783100001

Inorganic mineral doped polypyrrole for hydrogen storage in alkaline medium								INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY				45	1			401	411		10.1016/j.ijhydene.2019.10.116				JAN 1 2020	2020	Cupric chloride is used as oxidant to synthesize polypyrrole doped with inorganic mineral (ImDPpy). The formation of ImDPpy was confirmed by (HNMR)-H-1, BET, SEM, HRTEM, DSC, FTIR, Raman, XRD, UV-vis and XPS studies. The surface area calculated for ImDPpy is 36.671 m(2)/g. Surface area of IMDPpy is 4.671 m(2)/g higher than the reported value of Ppy in the literature. In DSC, ImDPpy display a peak at 88.07 degrees C (endothermic glass transition temperature, Tg), Tg of ImDPpy is almost identical to that of Ppy-MWCNT composite and is higher than Tg of undoped Ppy. Electrochemical analysis of ImDPpy in 0.01 M NaOH indicated the maximum charge stored in ImDPpy in the form of protons as 8090 mF/g. The maximum hydrogen storage capacity of ImDPpy is found to be 18mAh/g at an applied current density of 1 mA/cm(2). The mineral doped in Ppy during polymerization is identified as [Cu-2(OH)(3)Cl] from XPS and Raman analysis. (C) 2019 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

J	Tahar, NB; Savall, A								A comparison of different lead dioxide coated electrodes for the electrochemical destruction of phenol								JOURNAL OF NEW MATERIALS FOR ELECTROCHEMICAL SYSTEMS				2	1			19	26						JAN 1999	1999	This paper deals with the study of the performance of lead dioxide anodes for phenol degradation in aqueous solution. The lead dioxide is prepared in the laboratory either by positively polarizing a metallic lead support in sulfuric acid solution or by electrodeposition on a substrate using a lead nitrate electrolyte. Electrolyses of acidic solutions of phenol (pH = 2) at an initial concentration of 21 mmole dm(-3) are performed at an anode current density of 1000 A m(-2) and at T = 70 degrees C. The main products are 1, 4-benzoquinone, maleic acid and carbon dioxide. The kinetics of the phenol degradation is followed by HPLC and TOC analysis. The presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate, acetate ions and Cu2+ in the electrolytic solution of the PbO2 preparation decreases its efficiency and its resistance to corrosion. It is generally accepted that these species, which can be incorporated into the PbO2 deposit, modify its electrocatalytic properties. This study has also shown the effect of the type of substrate (Pb, Ti/(IrO2-Ta2O5) and Ta) on the stability and efficiency of PbO2 deposits for phenol degradation. The efficiency of the laboratory prepared electrodes decreases according to the type of substrate used as follows. Ta > Ti/(IrO2-Ta2O5) > Pb. Longevity tests have shown that the electrode Ti/(IrO2-Ta2O5)/PbO2 is much less efficient after 20 hours of use, while Ta/PbO2 has the same performance after 160 hours of operation.									27	0	0	0	9	1	27			1480-2422			WOS:000085276100003		
J	Luu, Norman S.; Park, Kyu-Young; Hersam, Mark C.					Hersam, Mark/0000-0003-4120-1426			Characterizing and Mitigating Chemomechanical Degradation in High-Energy Lithium-Ion Battery Cathode Materials								ACCOUNTS OF MATERIALS RESEARCH				3	5			511	524		10.1021/accountsmr.1c00282				MAY 27 2022	2022	Lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) are nearly ubiquitous energy storage solutions, powering devices ranging from consumer electronics to electric vehicles. To advance these applications, current LIB research efforts are directed toward improving energy and power densities, cyclic lifetimes, charging speeds, and safety. These parameters are intrinsically tied to properties of the active electrode materials, such as the redox mechanism, chemical composition, and crystal structure. One particularly challenging issue is that the active electrode materials that possess higher theoretical energy densities are generally more susceptible to degradation during cycling. A notable example is the family of layered multicomponent transition metal oxides, which is the incumbent class of active LIB cathode materials for electric vehicles. To increase their theoretical capacities, the transition metal fraction in these materials is trending toward higher Ni content. However, Ni-rich chemistries suffer from electrochemical, crystallographic, and mechanical degradation that increase in severity with increasing Ni content. Furthermore, alternative high-energy cathode materials, including overlithiated layered oxides and disordered rock salt materials, present additional stability challenges that must be overcome before they can be realistically incorporated into LIB technology.The chemomechanical degradation in high-energy LIB cathode materials occurs at multiple length scales. Point defects, such as antisite defects or vacancies, are commonly generated during electrochemical cycling and can contribute to the loss of cyclable active material. At both the primary and secondary particle level, electrochemical cycling also induces significant volumetric changes and state-of-charge heterogeneity, generating regions of high stress and strain that are precursors to mechanical fracture. Finally, at the electrode level, nonuniform charge transfer reactions throughout the electrode can lead to locally overcharged regions that become sites of enhanced degradation. To address these issues, active cathode material design and electrode engineering are being heavily pursued to accelerate improvements in LIB energy density. To consolidate the current understanding of chemomechanical degradation and provide guidance on mitigation strategies, a comprehensive overview of degradation mechanisms across multiple length scales is critically needed.In this Account, we first outline the origins of chemomechanical degradation for high-energy LIB cathodes, including layered oxides, overlithiated layered oxides, and disordered rock salt structures. Specifically, we delineate the thermodynamic and kinetic origins of defect generation at the atomic level and then progress to the kinetic origins of broader degradation mechanisms at the particle level and electrode level. Next, we discuss strategies for minimizing chemomechanical degradation in high-energy LIB cathodes at multiple length scales. Finally, we provide a forward-looking perspective on how to accelerate progress toward practical high-energy LIB cathodes, including emerging methods to map state-of-charge heterogeneity, efficient data processing techniques, and improved strategies for spatially identifying chemomechanical degradation. We also propose engineering solutions for mitigating chemomechanical degradation, such as grain boundary engineering, modifying the active material particle morphology, and electrode architecture design. Since many of these suggestions can be applied irrespective of cathode chemistry, this Account is likely to be broadly applicable to the diverse set of ongoing efforts to realize high-energy LIBs.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0				2643-6728		WOS:000805186100003

Based on the transient-state surface photovoltage responses and the atmosphere-controlled steady-state surface photovoltage spectra, it is concluded that the photogenerated charge carriers in the TiO2/BiVO4 nanocomposite with a proper mole ratio (5%) display much longer lifetime and higher separation than those in the BiVO4 alone. This is responsible for the unexpected activity for photoelectrochemical oxidation of water, for photocatalytic production of H-2, and for photocatalytic degradation of phenol as a model pollutant under visible irradiation. Moreover, it is suggested that the prolonged lifetime and increased separation of photogenerated charges in the fabricated TiO2/BiVO4 nanocomposite is attributed to the unusual spatial transfer of visible-excited high-energy electrons of BiVO4 to TiO2. This work will provide feasible routes to synthesize visible-light responsive nanomaterials for efficient solar utilization.									211	14	0	0	20	0	214			1614-6832	1614-6840		WOS:000333708100017

We present an AEM water electrolyzer with CuCoOx as the anode catalyst and Aemion as membrane and electrode binder. Full cell experiments in pure water and 0.1 M KOH revealed that the optimum binder content depended on the type of electrolyte employed. Online dissolution measurements suggested that Aemion alone was not sufficient to establish an alkaline environment for thermodynamically stabilizing the synthesized CuCoOx in a neutral electrolyte feed. A feed of base is thus indispensable to ensure the thermodynamic stability of such non-noble catalyst materials. Particle loss and delamination of the catalyst layer during MEA operation could be reduced by employing a heat treatment step after electrode fabrication. This work summarizes possible degradation pathways for low-cost anodes in AEMWE, and mitigation strategies for enhanced system durability and performance. (c) 2021 The Author(s).

X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy and elemental analysis data reveal the formation of carbonaceous material in the composites. The photocatalytic activity was evaluated by the H-2 liberation rate from water splitting under visible-light irradiation. The optimized composite, which is prepared from the precursor of hydrothermally treated melamine with cellulose acetate, shows 35 times higher photocatalytic activity than bulk g-C3N4 (melamine as the precursor) and a quantum efficiency of 1.05% (0.01 g of catalyst) under irradiation at 420 nm. The enhancement of the photocatalytic activity is ascribed to the unique electronic properties of the carbonaceous material, the enlarged specific surface area and the improved light absorption.									19	2	0	0	2	0	21			0920-5861	1873-4308		WOS:000438466000017

Samples with different amounts of CdS loading were prepared and characterized using ICP, N-2-physisorption, PXRD, DRS, SEM, TEM, HRTEM, STEM and EDS methods. The resulting composites were tested for photocatalytic hydrogen production through water splitting with platinum and lactic acid as co-catalyst and sacrificial agent, respectively. The optimized sample (with about 8 wt% CdS) showed 2.8 times higher activity compared to bulk CdS and retained its integrity through both long-term and recycling experiments. As an attempt to further elucidate the mechanism of photocatalytic activity enhancement, CdS/SBA-15 composite was investigated. Both CdS and MIL-125 proved to be active under irradiation but electron injection from CdS to MIL-125 is most likely to be the main mechanism for suppressing charge carrier recombination and also prohibiting photo-corrosion.									37	0	0	0	2	0	37			1369-8001	1873-4081		WOS:000427538400007

However, fundamental understanding of Cu-MEAs is still limited compared to the wealth of knowledge available for aqueous-electrolyte Cu systems. Physics-based modeling can assist in the transfer of knowledge from aqueous to vapor-fed systems by deconvoluting the impacts of various physical processes and accelerating the optimization of Cu-MEAs. Here, we simulate Cu-MEA performance and describe how the change in cell architecture leads to changes in cell performance and optimization. Our results reveal nonuniformity of product distribution in the catalyst layer, allowing us to explore catalyst-layer properties as design parameters for increasing the energy efficiency of C(2+)product formation. We discuss multiphase flow and water-management issues and show how membrane properties, specifically the electro-osmotic coefficient, affect the efficacy of feeding liquid water to hydrate the membrane. Finally, we explore tradeoffs associated with operating Cu-MEAs at 350 K in order to increase the supply of water and the preferential formation of products with higher activation energies (typically C(2+)products).									28	1	0	0	0	0	28			1754-5692	1754-5706		WOS:000579868500024

Trace metal abundances and their Mo-CrU isotopic ratios have been widely used for investigating ocean redox processes through the Archean and Paleoproterozoic. Mineralogically, IFs consist of three main Fe-bearing fractions: (1) Fe-Ca-Mg-Mn carbonates, (2) magnetite and/or hematite and (3) Fe-silicates. These fractions are typically fine-grained on a sub-mu m scale and their co-occurrence in varying amounts means that bulk-rock or microanalytical geochemical and stable isotope data can be influenced by cryptic changes in mineralogy. Fraction specific geochemical analysis has the potential to resolve mineralogical controls and reveal diagenetic versus primary precipitative controls on IF mineralogy. Here we adapt an existing sequential extraction scheme for Fe-phases (Poulton and Canfield, 2005) to the high Fe-content in IF and the specific three-fraction mineralogy. We optimized the scheme for magnetitedominated Archean IFs using samples from the hematite-poor Asbestos Hills Subgroup IF, Transvaal Supergroup, South Africa. Previously commonly-used hydroxylamine-HCl and dithionite leaches were omitted since ferric oxides are quantitatively insignificant in these IF samples. The acetate leach was tested at variable temperatures, reaction times and under different atmospheres in order to ensure that all micro-crystalline Fe-carbonates were effectively dissolved, resulting in an optimum extraction for 48 h at 50 degrees C under anoxic conditions. The dissolution of magnetite by NH4-oxalate was also tested, resulting in an optimum extraction for 24 h under an ambient atmosphere. Finally, a HF-HClO4-HNO3 leach was used to dissolve the residual silicate fraction which has to date not been considered in detail in IF. Accuracy of the extraction technique was generally excellent, as verified using 1) elemental recoveries, 2) comparison of major and trace element distributions against mineralogy and 3) comparison to results from microanalytical techniques.This study focuses on the distribution of three frequently used geochemical proxies in IF; U, Mo and Cr. Molybdenum abundances in the Kuruman and Griquatown IF are low and show an apparent correlation with mineralogical variability, as determined by the sequential extraction. This suggests that changes in bulk-rock mineralogy, rather than redox chemistry might significantly affect Mo stable isotopes. For Cr, a minor bulk-rock stratigraphic increase can be related to the oxide and silicate fraction. However, a positive relationship with Zr indicates that this was also controlled by detrital or volcanic ash input. Uranium is predominantly bound to the silicate fraction and shows clear correlations with Zr and Sc implying detrital reworking under anoxic conditions. The discrepant behaviour of these three proxies indicate that mineralogy should be taken into account when interpreting heterogeneous bulk-rock samples and that fraction specific techniques will provide new insights into the evolution of atmosphere and ocean chemistry.									15	0	0	0	1	0	15			0009-2541	1872-6836		WOS:000415613500003

Compared to traditional fabrication methods, such as ultrasonic spray and doctor blade, inkjet's drop-by-drop deposition allows for accurate deposition control, enabling the fabrication of low loading, conventional loading, patterned electrodes, while reducing catalyst waste. CCMs were prepared by IJP by depositing IrO2 and Pt/C inks over the membrane to fabricate anode and cathode electrodes respectively. The anode catalyst layer morphology was analyzed using an optical microscope and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) for surface and thickness characterization. SEM images show the catalyst layer is uniform and well adhered to the membrane. Hydrogen crossover and cyclic voltammetry (CV) tests were performed to estimate hydrogen cross-over, and double layer capacitance. Electrochemical performance tests showed that inkjet printed catalyst coated electrolyzer membranes fabricated achieved 1 and 2 A/cm(2) current densities at potentials of 1608 and 1694 mV (NRE211) and average of 1743 and 1994 mV (N117) respectively. These results outperform most previously reported electrolyzer data in the literature using commercial IrO2 catalyst and suggest that IJP can be used to fabricate electrolyzer electrodes with excellent performance and minimal catalyst wastage.

Investigations of the composition and structure of the screen-printed films by X-ray diffraction, X-ray absorption spectroscopy, and scanning electron microscopy confirmed that the material was present as the cubic NiO phase. Comparison of the catalytic activity of the microball films to that of films fabricated by using NiO nanoparticles, under similar experimental conditions, revealed that the microball films outperform nanoparticle films of similar thickness owing to a more porous structure and higher surface area. A thinner, less-resistive NiO nanoparticle film, however, was found to have higher activity per Ni atom. Anodization in borate buffer significantly improved the activity of all three films. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy showed that during anodization, a mixed nickel oxyhydroxide phase formed on the surface of all films, which could account for the improved activity. Impedance spectroscopy revealed that surface traps contribute significantly to the resistance of the NiO films. On anodization, the trap state resistance of all films was reduced, which led to significant improvements in activity. In 1.00M NaOH, both the microball and nanoparticle films exhibit high long-term stability and produce a stable current density of approximately 30 mA cm(-2) at 600 mV overpotential.									16	0	0	0	1	0	16			1864-5631	1864-564X		WOS:000367825900019	26617200

It is shown that the TiN coating has a rough surface and layered cross-section structure. The coating consists of main TiN phase and a small quantity of Ti oxides. After heat-treated below 550 C the TiN coating is greatly densified due to the increase of Ti oxides, and however the electric resistance of the Fe/TiN samples is still lower than that of the Ti substrate. For the Fe/TiN/PbO2 electrode a rougher surface and more micropores were observed in the active PbO2 coating than on the surface of the Ti/PbO2 electrode. Due to the presence of the TiN interlayer the Fe/TiN/PbO2 electrode shows an accelerated life of 180h under the test condition, which is much longer than 28min of the Ti/PbO2 electrode.					3rd International Conference on Mechanical and Electronics Engineering (ICMEE 2011)3rd International Conference on Mechanical and Electronics Engineering (ICMEE 2011)	SEP 23-25, 2011SEP 23-25, 2011	Hefei Univ TechnolHefei Univ Technol	Hefei, PEOPLES R CHINAHefei, PEOPLES R CHINA	2	0	0	0	0	0	2			1660-9336		978-3-03785-286-6	WOS:000307487500211

However, achieving highly efficient and long-life electrodes is still a great challenge. Herein, Ti/RuO2-IrO2@Pt anodes consisting of Pt4+ and Pt-0 species were fabricated by combining modified microemulsion technology with a calcination process, in which Pt nanoparticles were highly dispersed and encapsulated in Ru-Ir composite oxides to form a strong metal-support interaction (SMSI) structure. The as-constructed SMSI layer on the Ti/RuO2-IrO2@Pt anode resulted in the improvement of the charge transfer capability and also increased the degradation (99.30%) and mineralization (91.32%) of PFOA during the electrochemical oxidation process. Notably, the service lifetime of Ti/RuO2-IrO2@Pt anodes was remarkably improved from 24 to 42.3 h compared to commercial Ti/RuO2-IrO2 anodes. Moreover, the possible degradation mechanism of PFOA was also speculated through the detection of short-chain perfluorocarboxylic acids and reactive radicals. These results not only revealed that the concept and methodology of SMSI could be an effective way for constructing highly efficient and stable electrocatalysts but also greatly advanced fundamental understanding.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000757520600001	35179172

Furthermore, the authors innovatively proposed a heteroatomic engineering strategy to further improve the visible-light capture ability and separation of electron-hole pairs of heterojunction photocatalysts via replacing carbon atoms in donors by nitrogen atoms. The result revealed that in the photocatalytic reduction of uranium, the kinetic constant of PFB/CN (0.037 min(-1)) was 2.47 times higher than that of CN (0.015 min(-1)). Notably, copolymerization of a nitrogen-containing electron donor carbazole unit into the polymer backbone would further widen the light response range and promote electron-hole separation within PCB/CN as compared to PFB/CN, leading to a higher kinetic constant (0.049 min(-1)), 3.27 times higher than that of CN. The current work underlines that adapting a reasonable heteroatomic engineering strategy for polymer heterojunctions is a remarkably effective strategy to develop up-and-coming organic semiconductor photocatalysts for efficient reduction of uranium.									15	2	0	0	1	0	16			2058-9689			WOS:000533966800016		
J	Zhu, Yanwei; Wang, Longlu; Liu, Yutang; Shao, Luhua; Xia, Xinnian								In-situ hydrogenation engineering of ZnIn2S4 for promoted visible-light water splitting								APPLIED CATALYSIS B-ENVIRONMENTAL				241				483	490		10.1016/j.apcatb.2018.09.062				FEB 2019	2019	Hydrogenation engineering has been considered as one of the promising methodologies to significantly enhance the visible light absorption and photocatalytic activities of semiconductor photocatalyst. However, hydrogenated catalyst with remarkably elevated photocatalytic activity has been commonly obtained so far under severe conditions such as high temperatures or pressures and huge doses of H-2 or plasma activation with complex treatment. Here, we proposed in-situ hydrogenated ZnIn2S4 (H(x)ZIS) obtained at room temperature under UV-vis light illumination within several hours. This extremely facile hydrogenation strategy is based on the discovered fact that H could spontaneously adsorb on the ZnIn2S4 (ZIS) surface to generate durable point defects and even surface disorder, resulting in the largely enhanced solar energy utilization of ZIS. As a result, the hydrogenation engineered the band gap from 2.42 to 1.51 eV, while the optimal bandgap was tuned to ca. 2.08 eV with a -10-fold photocatalytic activity promotion. This study is the first paradigm of in-situ hydrogenation of inorganic metal chalcogenide, and we believe that such a facile and general methodology will open up a new pathway to create high-efficiency photocatalyst.									58	6	0	0	7	0	58			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000449444000050

The water electrolysis performance and properties of the prepared MEA were evaluated and analyzed by polarization curves, electrochemistry impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The characterizations revealed that the CSMUI method is very effective for preparing high performance MEA for SPE water electrolysis: the cell voltage can be as low as 1.564 V at 1 A cm(-2) and the terminal voltage is only 1.669 V at 2 A cm(-2), which are among the best results yet reported for SPE water electrolysis with IrO2 catalyst. Also, it is found that the noble metal catalysts loadings of the MEA prepared by this method can be greatly decreased without significant performance degradation. At a current density of 1 A cm(-2), the MEA showed good stability for water electrolysis operating: the cell voltage remained at 1.60 V without obvious deterioration after 105 h operation under atmosphere pressure and 80 degrees C.

So far, the researchers designed and constructed some multi-component heterostructure photocatalysts, but they are still unable to avoid the recombination of photoexcited electron-hole pairs. This study introduces a built-in electric field in a one-component nanosheet to promote photo-generated carrier separation. For this reason, CdS nanosheets with both photocatalytic and piezoelectric properties were selected as research objects. The combination of these two properties renders CdS an excellent candidate for efficiently utilizing both light and vibrational energy for photocatalytic water splitting, without the need for coupling it to other materials or using an external bias. The result shows that the photocatalytic and piezoelectric coupling effect of CdS can make hydrogen production reach 633 L h(-1), which was more than twice the superposition of light and vibration. The development of this coupling effect contributes to the application of green energies, such as the use of natural sunlight and noise or vibration.									55	4	0	0	8	0	55			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000469245300043	31026013

Herein, for the first time, amorphous nickel borate has been synthesized via a facile and scalable co-precipitation method at room temperature and hybrid supercapacitors have been fabricated based on the synthesized amorphous nickel borate. A high specific capacity of 137.9 mA h g(-1) can be achieved in three-electrode configurations. The assembled asymmetric hybrid supercapacitor device with active carbon as the counter electrode shows a high energy density of 42.4 W h kg(-1) at a power density of 800 W kg(-1). Even after 10000 charge-discharge cycles, cycling at a high current density of 10 A g(-1), the device still retained over 97% specific capacity. These outstanding electrochemical performances can be attributed to the large surface area and abundant inherent defects that allow full contact between the electrode materials and electrolyte. These findings pave the way for exploring other transition metal borates and amorphous materials for high performance supercapacitor electrodes.									29	2	0	0	2	0	30			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000448413100041

Samples were heat treated at 300, 350, 400, 450 and 500 degrees C after chloride Ir and Ru precursors were added to Sb2O5-SnO2. Photoelectron kinetic energies of 100, 350 and 1400 eV were employed to obtain an indication of the depth of elemental distributions and chemical shifts. It was shown that the electrocatalyst consists of a core of Sb2O5-SnO2 enriched with Sb2O5 towards the surface, with a shell of IrO2-RuO2 deposited on this core, and an outer layer of Sb2O5-SnO2 over this shell. No significant chemical interaction occurs between IrO2-RuO2 and Sb2O5-SnO2. The energy resolved XPS depth profile technique is effective for studying core-shell materials.

Here, we synthesize a bifunctional catalyst (Co5.47N/Co3Fe7/NC) consisting of two kinds of active sites. The Co5.47N/Co3Fe7/NC catalyst shows excellent electrocatalytic activities with a half-wave potential of 0.89 V (versus RHE) for ORR and a low potential of 1.609 V at 10 mA cm-2 for OER in alkaline condition. When the catalyst was used in ZAB, the ZAB provides a maximal power density of 264 mW cm-2 and maintains a stable voltage gap over 180 h. The results show that Co5.47N plays a very important role in both ORR and OER processes, because it effectively improves the conductivity of catalysts. Moreover, the two-phase interface produced by the two crystal structures will produce an electronic coupling effect, forming a large number of active sites. This catalyst provides a reliable alternative to air cathode catalysts for rechargeable zinc air batteries.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000762844400007

After oxidation treatments in air, Fe was converted into Fe2O3, and nanopores were opened on CNHs from 1 to 5 nm controlled by oxidation temperature. Fe-N-CNHs oxidized in O-2 at 550 degrees C (Fe2O3-N-CNH550ox) show 245 mV at 20 mA cm(-1), which is much smaller than that of the ones oxidized at 500 degrees C (Fe2O3-N-CNH500ox), contributing to the larger pore size on CNHs (3-5 nm vs 2-3 nm) and a larger number of nanopores caused by the enhanced sidewall nanopores. However, the stability of Fe2O3-N-CNH550ox becomes much poorer than that of Fe2O3-N-CNH500ox after 2000 cycles. The unique relationship between the overpotential and long-term stability can be explained by the consideration of the size of Fe2O3 nanoparticles and nanopores on CNHs. Furthermore, the stability for Fe2O3-N-CNH550ox can be rapidly increased after heat treatment in Ar for 1 h caused by shrinking the size of tip nanopores. Herein, we first reveal that the performance of OER is related to the nanopore size of carbon carriers and the catalyst of nanometal particles. The optimization of pore-opening conditions in carbon carriers can be achieved a superior electrocatalytic OER performance, including a low overpotential at high current density and long-term stability.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			0020-1669	1520-510X		WOS:000715230700072	34665597

In this Perspective, we examine carrier transport in semiconductor photoelectrodes using bismuth vanadate as a primary model system and highlight strategies to significantly improve carrier delivery through defect engineering. To improve electron transport in low-mobility semiconductors, we introduce two distinct bulk doping methods, by homogeneously enhancing the bulk defect level or by forming distributed homojunctions with graded doping. Next, we demonstrate the use of structural boundaries as extrinsic pathways for fast electron transport, thus providing novel insights to engineer materials' macroscopic conductivity. Third, we describe the importance of interface design in terms of structural, chemical, and electronic matching at the back contact to suppress carrier recombination. Finally, we highlight the methods for surface defect control via passivation and catalysis and give a brief outlook of research challenges and opportunities for solar water splitting.									16	0	0	0	1	0	16			2380-8195			WOS:000464889300006

M-6-BTB and related nMOLs are formed by linking M-6(mu(3)-O)(4)(mu(3)-OH)(4) (M = Zr4+, Hf4+, Ce4+) SBUs and planar tricarboxylate bridging ligands such as 1,3,5-benzene-tribenzoate (BTB), while M-12-nMOLs are constructed from M-12(mu(3)-O)(8)(mu(3)-OH)(8) (mu(2)-OH)(6) (M = Zr4+, Hf4+) SBUs and linear dicarboxylate ligands such as 5,15-di(p-benzoato)porphyrin (DBP). Mechanistic studies revealed the important roles of capping agents and water on the growth of nMOLs and the stepwise growth process involving the partial hydrolysis of metal ions to form metal-oxo clusters with capping agents and the subsequent replacement of capping agents by bridging ligands. The 2D nature of nMOLs facilitates the postsynthetic modification of bridging ligands and the exchange of capping agents to simultaneously incorporate multifunctionalities into nMOLs.In this Account, we discuss the design principles, growth mechanisms, and postsynthetic functionalization strategies for nMOLs and summarize our research efforts to design nMOLs for various biological and biomedical applications. We first outline the strategies for the design and synthesis of M-6- and M-12-nMOLs via a dimensional reduction strategy and discuss the growth mechanisms of nMOLs. We then highlight the methods for the postsynthetic functionalization of nMOLs. We demonstrate the application of nMOLs in two broad categories. We first show the design and development of nMOLs for radiotherapy-radiodynamic therapy (RT-RDT) and further combination with checkpoint blockade immunotherapy. The evolution of Hf-6-nMOLs to Hf-12-nMOLs illustrates the control of nMOL morphology and photosensitizer loading for optimal RT-RDT effects. The nMOL-mediated RT-RDT is further combined with checkpoint blockade cancer immunotherapy to enable the treatment of systemic diseases via local X-ray irradiation. We next demonstrate nMOLs as a versatile platform for ratiometric sensing/imaging and drug delivery. The easily accessible sites on SBUs and ligands in nMOLs provide conjugation sites for multifunctional sensors and drugs, allowing for simultaneous ratiometric sensing of the pH and oxygen concentration or pH and glutathione concentration in mitochondria as well as highly effective photodynamic therapy with insoluble conjugated zinc phthalocyanine.We discuss the limitations of currently available nMOLs in terms of a lack of structural diversity and lower stability compared to nMOFs. We also point out the untapped potential of using the inherent hierarchy of SBU and bridging ligand structures to integrate multiple functionalities for synergistic functions. With the establishment of general design principles and an understanding of nMOL growth mechanisms, we believe that nMOLs will emerge as a fertile research field with great potential for applications beyond radiotherapy-radiodynamic therapy, immunotherapy, multifunctional biosensing, and drug delivery.									3	0	0	0	1	0	3				2643-6728		WOS:000711029400010

Then constant-potential electrodeposition is applied to anchor Pd nanoparticles on CoMn2O4 to form an electrode of Pd nanopartides modified CoMn2O4 (PCMN electrode) for H2O2 electroreduction. The combination of Pd and CoMn2O4 effectively reduces the dosage of noble metal. Besides. no binder is involved in the preparation which cuts the electrode cost and avoids the poor stability of traditional electrodes produced with binders. Scanning electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction and transmission electron microscopy are operated to investigate the structure and composition of the electrode. And the electrochemical behavior of the electrode is characterized by cyclic voltammetry and chronoamperometry. In 0.7 mol L-1 H2O2 and 3 mol L-1 NaOH, a reduction current density of 580 mA cm(-2) (normalized by geometric area) at -0.8 V on the electrode is obtained which reveals large capacity for actual application in H2O2-based fuel cell.

J	Wang, Xiaoqin; Wu, Qiong; Ma, Hongchao; Ma, Chun; Yu, Zhihui; Fu, Yinghuan; Dong, Xiaoli								Fabrication of PbO2 tipped Co3O4 nanowires for efficient photoelectrochemical decolorization of dye (reactive brilliant blue KN-R) wastewater								SOLAR ENERGY MATERIALS AND SOLAR CELLS				191				381	388		10.1016/j.solmat.2018.12.005				MAR 2019	2019	A novel heterostructure of PbO2 tipped Co3O4 nanowire arrays (NWs) is fabricated by the combination of hydrothermal synthesis and electrochemical deposition. The hydrothermal process is used to fabricate the Co3O4 nanowire arrays (NWs) on the Ti sheet substrates, and subsequently the PbO2 nanoparticles were preferentially adhered on the sharptip of Co3O4 NWs using an electrochemical deposition method. It is found that the as constructed PbO2/Co3O4 composites exhibit large electroactive areas, low charge transfer resistance, high efficiency regarding the generation of hydroxyl radicals. The photoelectrochemical (PEC) properties of as-constructed PbO2/Co3O4 composites were evaluated by the decolorization of dye (reactive brilliant blue KN-R) in aqueous solution. The PEC measurement indicated that as-constructed PbO2/Co3O4 composites have higher PEC acitivity, better reproducibility and obvious photoelectric synergism, as compared with bare Co3O4 NWs. The promoted PEC ability for the PbO2/Co3O4 composites can be ascribed to the construction of heterointerface between PbO2 and Co3O4. The present work offered attractive perspectives for applications of the PbO2 tipped Co3O4 NWs in the photoanode regarding the treatment of refractory organic pollutant.									36	1	0	0	4	0	36			0927-0248	1879-3398		WOS:000456640000046

Ta3N5 nanotube (NT) arrays were synthesized on a Ta foil by electrochemical anodization followed by an ammonia treatment at 800 degrees C. The photocurrent of nanostructured Ta3N5 was over 3 times higher than that of a dense regular Ta3N5 film in 0.1 M Na2SO4 aqueous solution at pH 11. Several electrocatalysts (IrO2 nanoparticles (NPs), Co3O4 NPs, cobalt phosphate, and Pt NPs) were used to modify Ta3N5 NTs for PEC water oxidation. The photocurrent of Ta3N5 NTs modified with IrO2 and Co3O4 was ca. four times higher than that of unmodified NTs. Cobalt phosphate also showed a positive improvement for PEC water oxidation on Ta3N5 NTs, whereas Pt was ineffective. Scanning electrochemical microscopy was used to measure the faradaic efficiency of the Ta3N5 photoanodes for water oxidation, which can reach as high as 88% for a Co3O4-Ta3N5 NTs photoanode, but is less than 15% at best, for Ta3N5 without the electrocatalyst. The results indicate that cobalt oxide and cobalt phosphate are promising candidates as electrocatalysts on Ta3N5 for water oxidation because Co is an earth-abundant material.									105	9	0	0	8	0	109			1932-7447			WOS:000306303800040

Herein, we assess the activity of PrFeO3 photocathodes prepared by using spray pyrolysis and calcination temperatures between 500 and 700 degrees C. Scanning electron microscopy shows corrugated films of high surface coverage on the conductive glass substrate. The electrochemically active surface area shows slight decreases with temperature increases from 500 to 600 and 700 degrees C. However, transient photocurrent responses and impedance spectroscopy data showed that films calcined at higher temperatures reduced the probabilities of recombination due to trap states, resulting in faster rates of charge extraction. In this trade-off, a calcination temperature of 600 degrees C provided a maximum photocurrent of -130 +/- 4 mu A cm(-2) at +0.43 V-RHE under simulated sunlight, with an incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency of 6.6 % at +0.61 V-RHE and 350 nm and an onset potential of +1.4 V-RHE for cathodic photocurrent.									12	0	1	0	0	0	13			2196-0216			WOS:000522359100008

However, although activation of the Li2MnO3 phase is known to play an essential role in providing superior capacity, the mechanism of activation of the Li2MnO3 phase in Li-rich cathode materials is still not fully understood. In this work, an interesting Li-rich cathode material Li1.87Mn0.94Ni0.19O3 is reported where the Li2MnO3 phase activation process can be effectively controlled due to the relatively low level of Ni doping. Such a unique feature offers the possibility of investigating the detailed activation mechanism by examining the intermediate states and phases of the Li2MnO3 during the controlled activation process. Combining powerful synchrotron in situ X-ray diffraction analysis and observations using advanced scanning transmission electron microscopy equipped with a high angle annular dark field detector, it has been revealed that the subreaction of O-2 generation may feature a much faster kinetics than the transition metal diffusion during the Li2MnO3 activation process, indicating that the latter plays a crucial role in determining the Li2MnO3 activation rate and leading to the unusual stepwise capacity increase over charging cycles.									112	1	0	0	2	0	114			1616-301X	1616-3028		WOS:000367219400010

Density functional theory (DFT) calculations indicate that the exposure of C-NH/NH2 groups not only introduces an acceptor impurity level, but also strengthens the adsorption interaction between pollutants and LCN by fostering stronger pi-pi interactions between the aromatic ring of BPA and the N atom in C-N=C of LCN. Based on the results of UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectra, electron paramagnetic resonance spectra and transient photocurrent response spectra, the adsorbed organic pollutant creates a donor impurity level in the energy band of LCN, endowing LCN with efficient light-harvesting properties. Therefore, in addition to pollutant degradation by HO2 center dot/O-2(center dot-), the direct photo-excited electron transfer from pollutant molecules to conduction band/acceptor impurity level of LCN under visible-light irradiation further enhances the photocatalytic pollutant degradation performance compared with bulk g-C3N4.									10	0	0	0	4	0	10			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000706858100005

Corrosion of semiconductor photoabsorbers in the aqueous conditions needed for water splitting is a major challenge that limits device stability. In addition, a precious-metal catalyst is often required to efficiently promote water splitting. Herein, we demonstrate unassisted water splitting using a nonprecious metal molybdenum disulfide nanomaterial catalytic protection layer paired with a GaInAsP/GaAs tandem device. This device was able to achieve stable unassisted water splitting for nearly 12 h, while a sibling sample with a PtRu catalyst was only stable for 2 h, highlighting the advantage of the nonprecious metal catalyst. In situ optical imaging illustrates the progression of macroscopic degradation that causes device failure. In addition, this work compares unassisted water splitting devices across the field in terms of the efficiency and stability, illustrating the need for improved stability.									27	0	0	0	0	0	27			2380-8195			WOS:000562954100024

Three types of flow-field pattern (serpentine, parallel, and cascade) were tested in both the anode and cathode sides of a water electrolyzer cell, and the current-voltage characteristics and high-frequency resistance were measured to examine which overpotential components are impacted by the flow-field pattern. The experimental results revealed that the cathode flow-field pattern only affects the ohmic overpotential, while the anode flow-field pattern significantly affects the overpotential related to liquid water shortage at catalyst layer, and the flow configuration (counter- and co-flow) does not affect the electrolysis performance. Finally, under operating conditions of 120 degrees C and 0.3 MPa, we found that the optimized cell configuration consisted of cascade and serpentine flow-field patterns in the anode and cathode, respectively; this configuration produced the minimum electrolysis voltage of 1.69 V at 2 A/cm(2).

Waste-gas streams from power plants that use novel technologies (such as oxyfuel, the focus of this paper) can circumvent the capture step thanks to their CO2-rich composition (CO2>90%), but at the expense of stream CO2 purity (N-2, O-2, Ar, and other minor species may be present). Relatively high purity levels must be achieved to avoid compression and complications in pipeline transportation (two-phase flow) and, potentially, subsurface impacts. The CO2 Capture Project Phase 3 (CCP3) has started investigating the latter, which, in turn, inform techno-economic assessments of capture and transportation economics. Subsurface impacts of an impure CO2 stream could be twofold: (1) complicate flow behavior and reduce static capacity because of density and viscosity differences and (2) undermine reservoir and top seal integrity due to reaction with reactive species (O-2, CO, SOx). Using a range of potential oxyfuel waste-gas compositions, we approached the first issue through a desktop study using the numerical modeling tool. So that we could work with accurate flow parameters, we performed laboratory experiments in order to determine the actual viscosity and density of the mixtures. Information on solubility of these various mixture components in the aqueous phase under various pressure, temperature, and salinity conditions was also collected. An important observation controlling all results of the study was that viscosity and density of mixtures are lower than those of pure CO2 at the same temperatures and pressures. It follows that a plume of CO2 with impurities, moving updip with no barrier, will migrate farther from the point of injection but will be trapped through residual saturation sooner than will a plume of pure CO2. A larger plume means that a larger area must be inspected for leakage pathways, such as faults and wells, but faster trapping means a shorter monitoring period. Equally important is that contrasts of viscosity and density between pure CO2 and a CO2 mixture decrease with depth, suggesting that differences in flow behavior and storage capacity are similarly reduced with depth. Whereas flow behavior may impact the whole field, geochemical impacts are more likely to be restricted to the well-bore environment and the near field. Batch experiments conducted in high-pressure, high-temperature autoclaves with rocks immersed in synthetic brine and exposed to supercritical CO2 with and without admixed O-2 suggest that O-2 may change the geochemistry of subsurface systems in ways that the pure CO2 case does not. Results of the study, therefore, present the CO2 project developer with tradeoffs in capacity, pressure evolution, and monitoring scenarios, with additional costs likely more than offset by reduced capture costs.

The model took into account the behavior of Cl+ ions, Cl and O neutrals, and etch products and byproducts of SiClx and SiClxOy in microstructures and on feature surfaces therein. The surface chemistry and kinetics included surface chlorination, chemical etching, ion-enhanced etching, sputtering, surface oxidation, redeposition of etch products desorbed from feature surfaces being etched, and deposition of etch byproducts coming from the plasma. The model also took into account the ion reflection or scattering from feature surfaces on incidence and/or the ion penetration into substrates, along with geometrical shadowing of the feature and surface reemission of neutrals. The simulation domain was taken to consist of small cubic cells of atomic size, and the evolving interfaces were represented by removing Si atoms from and/or allocating them to the cells concerned. Calculations were performed for square substrates 50 nm on a side by varying the ion incidence angle onto substrate surfaces, typically with an incoming ion energy, ion flux, and neutral reactant-to-ion flux ratio of E-i = 100 eV, Gamma(0)(i) = 1.0 x 10(16) cm(-2) s(-1), and Gamma(0)(n) /Gamma(0)(i) = 100. Numerical results showed that nanoscale roughened surface features evolve with time during etching, depending markedly on ion incidence angle; in effect, at theta(i) = 0 degrees or normal incidence, concavo-convex features are formed randomly on surfaces. On the other hand, at increased theta(i) = 45 degrees or oblique incidence, ripple structures with a wavelength of the order of 15 nm are formed on surfaces perpendicularly to the direction of ion incidence; in contrast, at further increased theta(i) >= 75 degrees or grazing incidence, small ripples or slitlike grooves with a wavelength of <5 nm are formed on surfaces parallel to the direction of ion incidence. Such surface roughening and rippling in response to ion incidence angle were also found to depend significantly on ion energy and incoming fluxes of neutral reactants, oxygen, and etch byproducts. Two-dimensional power spectral density analysis of the roughened feature surfaces simulated was employed in some cases to further characterize the lateral as well as vertical extent of the roughness. The authors discuss possible mechanisms responsible for the formation and evolution of the surface roughness and ripples during plasma etching, including stochastic roughening, local micromasking, and effects of ion reflection, surface temperature, and ion angular distribution. Moreover, plasma etching experiments of blank Si substrates in Cl2 were conducted by varying the rf bias power or ion incident energy to verify the validity of our ASCeM-3D model.A comparison of the etch rate and root-mean-square (rms) surface roughness between experiments and simulations indicated that the ASCeM-3D with theta(i) = 0 degrees reproduces well the experiments at E-i< 250 eV, while does not reproduce the rms roughness at higher E-i > 250 eV, where the roughness decreases with increasing E-i in experiments, while continues to increase with E-i in simulations. Possible mechanisms for this disagreement at increased E-i are discussed with the help of several plasma and surface diagnostics and classical molecular dynamics simulations for Si/Cl and Si/SiCl systems.

The SEM and TEM results demonstrate that MoS2/CdSe/TiO2 ternary composites have a porous structure, which can provide more active sites and mass charge transport pathways in a catalytic system. The optical measurement demonstrates that the MoS2 and CdSe coexisted in the porous TiO2 structure, which results in a wider visible light absorption than that of pure TiO2. Most importantly, the photoelectrochemical measurement results demonstrate that such ternary composite catalysts exhibit a higher photocurrent performance than that of a binary composite and pure TiO2, owing to the strong synergistic effects among MoS2, CdSe, and TiO2. These superior results show that MoS2/CdSe/TiO2 ternary composites is a promising choice for photoelectrochemical water splitting.									40	2	0	0	3	0	40			1387-1811	1873-3093		WOS:000469893200048

Systems with power of hundreds of kW or even MWs, corresponding to hydrogen production rates of around 10 to 20 kg/h, have started to appear in the past 5 years. The thin (similar to 0.2 mm) polymer electrolyte in the PEWE with low ohmic resistance, compared to the alkaline cell with liquid electrolyte, allows operation at high current densities of 1-3 A/cm(2) and high differential pressure. This article, after an introductory overview of the operating principles of PEWE and state-of-the-art, discusses the state of understanding of key phenomena determining and limiting performance, durability, and commercial readiness, identifies important 'gaps' in understanding and essential development needs to bring PEWE science & engineering forward to prosper in the energy market as one of its future backbone technologies. For this to be successful, science, engineering, and process development as well as business and market development need to go hand in hand. (C) The Author(s) 2017.

CO and O-2 Binding to Pseudo-tetradentate Ligand-Copper(I) Complexes with a Variable N-Donor Moiety: Kinetic/Thermodynamic Investigation Reveals Ligand-Induced Changes in Reaction Mechanism								JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN CHEMICAL SOCIETY				132	37			12927	12940		10.1021/ja104107q				SEP 22 2010	2010	The kinetics, thermodynamics, and coordination dynamics are reported for O-2 and CO 1:1 binding to a series of pseudo-tetradentate ligand copper(I) complexes ((LCuI)-L-D) to give Cu-I/O-2 and Cu-I/CO product species. Members of the (LCuI)-L-D series possess an identical tridentate core structure where the cuprous ion binds to the bispicolylamine (L) fragment. L-D also contains a fourth variable N-donor moiety {D = benzyl (Bz); pyridyl (Py); imidazolyl (Im); dimethylamino (NMe2); (tert-butylphenyl)pyridyl (TBP); quinolyl (Q)}. The structural characteristics of (LCuI)-L-D-CO and (LCuI)-L-D are detailed, with X-ray crystal structures reported for (LCuI)-L-TBP-CO, (LCuI)-L-Bz-CO, and (LCuI)-L-Q. Infrared studies (solution and solid-state) confirm that (LCuI)-L-D-CO possess the same four-coordinate core structure in solution with the variable D moiety "dangling", i.e., not coordinated to the copper(I) ion. Other trends observed for the present series appear to derive from the degree to which the D-group interacts with the cuprous ion center. Electrochemical studies reveal close similarities of behavior for (LCuI)-L-Im and (LCuI)-L-NMe2 (as well as for (LCuI)-L-TBP and (LCuI)-L-Q), which relate to the O-2 binding kinetics and thermodynamics. Equilibrium CO binding data (K-CO, Delta H degrees, Delta S degrees) were obtained by conducting UV-visible spectrophotometric CO titrations, while CO binding kinetics and thermodynamics (k(CO), Delta H-not equal, Delta S-not equal) were measured through variable-temperature (193-293 K) transient absorbance laser flash photolysis experiments, lambda(ex) = 355 nm. Carbon monoxide dissociation rate constants (k(-CO)) and corresponding activation parameters (Delta H-not equal, Delta S-not equal) have also been obtained. CO binding to (LCuI)-L-D follows an associative mechanism, with the increased donation from D leading to higher k(CO) values. Unlike observations from previous work, the K-CO values increased as the k(CO) and k(-CO) values declined; the latter decreased at a faster rate. By using the "flash-and-trap" method (lambda(ex) = 355 nm, 188-218 K), the kinetics and thermodynamics (k(O2), Delta H-not equal, Delta S-not equal) for O-2 binding to (LCuI)-L-Nme2 and (LCuI)-L-Im were measured and compared to those for (LCuI)-L-Py. A surprising change in the O-2 binding mechanism was deduced from the thermodynamic Delta S-not equal values observed, associative for (LCuI)-L-Py but dissociative for (LCuI)-L-Nme2 and (LCuI)-L-Im; these results are interpreted as arising from a difference in the timing of electron transfer from copper(I) to O-2 as this molecule coordinates and a tetrahydrofuran (THF) solvent molecule dissociates. The change in mechanism was not simply related to alterations in (LCuII/I)-L-D geometries or the order in which O-2 and THF coordinate.The equilibrium O-2 binding constant (K-O2, Delta H degrees, Delta S degrees) and O-2 dissociatin rate constants (k(-O2), Delta H-not equal, Delta S-not equal) were also determined. Overall the results demonstrate that subtle changes in the coordination environment, as occur over time through evolution in nature or through controlled ligand design in synthetic systems, dictate to a critically detailed level the observed chemistry in terms of reaction kinetics, structure, and reactivity, and thus function. Results reported here are also compared to relevant copper and/or iron biological systems and analogous synthetic ligand copper systems.									28	1	0	0	10	0	29			0002-7863			WOS:000282013700044	20726586

In this study, the novel Ti-based MnOx electrodes co-incorporated with rare earth (Ce) and conductive carbon black (C) were prepared by spraying-calcination method. The Ti/Ce:MnOx-C electrode, with uniformand integrate surface and enhancedMn(IV) content by CandCe co-incorporating, could completely remove ammonia nitrogen (NH4+-N) with N-2 as themain product. The cell potential and energy consumption of Ti/Ce:MnOx-C electrode during the electrochemical process was significantlyreducedcomparedwithTi/MnOx electrode, whichmainlyoriginatedfromtheenhancedelectrochemical activityandreducedcharge transfer resistance by Ce and C co-incorporating. The accelerated lifetime tests in sulfuric acid showed that the actual service lifetime of Ti/Ce:MnOx-Cwas ca. 25 times that of Ti/MnOx, which demonstrated the significantly promoted stability of MnOx-based electrode by Ce and C co-incorporating.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0273-1223	1996-9732		WOS:000701286700001	34810311

The effects of deposition variables are systematically investigated and discussed. The deposition current density has been found to determine the morphology of hydroxides whereby a small current density facilitates the formation of porous nanonetwork microstructures. Both pH and temperature of the precursor solution affect the Co/Ni ratio of hydroxides, which in turn influence the capacitive performances. Eventually, Ni0.32Co0.68(OH)(2) synthesized under our proposed deposition condition exhibits a specific capacitance value of ca. 1000 F g(-1) at 5 mV s(-1), 100% capacitance cycle-retention over 1000 cycles, and 69% capacitance rate-retention (varying from 5 to 500 mV s(-1)). These superior capacitive performances make Ni0.32Co0.68(OH)(2) a promising material of the positive electrode for an asymmetric supercapacitor with an energy efficiency of 90% at 10 A g(-1).

We grew cells acclimated to high C-i (4 mM) or low C-i (0.02 mM), shifted them from 50 mu mol m(-2) s(-1) to 500 mu mol m(-2) s(-1), and quantified their photosynthetic performance in parallel with quantitation of allocations to key indicator macromolecules. Pigments cell(-1) declined, PsbA (PS II), AtpB (ATP Synthase), RbcL (Rubisco) and GlnA (Glutamine Synthetase) increased, and PsaC (PS I) remained stable through the light shift. The increase in these protein pools was slower and smaller in low C-i cells, but acted in both cell types to re-normalise the electron fluxes through the catalytic complexes back toward values before the light shift (for PsbA and GlnA) or even below the initial flux per complex (for RbcL). In contrast, an increased electron flux per PsaC was sustained for at least 6 h after the increase in light. Initially, high levels of PS II cell(-1) and PS II connectivity in high C-i cells caused a more rapid net photoinactivation of PS II in high C-i cells than in low C-i cells, depressing the rate of PS II-specific electron transport (PS II ETR) to levels similar to linear ETR (net O-2 evolution minus respiration). In low C-i cells, PS II ETR remained in excess of linear ETR and may have helped maintain CCM activity. The pool sizes of PsbA, AtpB and GlnA correlated with cellular growth rate, and changed at similar rates in high C-i and low C-i cells when expressed on a generational rather than chronological timescale, which has implications for differing ecology of high and low C-i cells under variable natural light.									8	0	0	0	7	0	8			0166-8595	1573-5079		WOS:000231949800007	16170636

Part I: Experimental observations and a multi species diffusion model								GEOCHIMICA ET COSMOCHIMICA ACTA				74	1			274	292		10.1016/j.gca.2009.10.016				JAN 1 2010	2010	There are an increasing number Of Studies that focus on the systematics of the distribution of Li and its isotopes among different geochemical reservoirs. These studies have found that Li is relatively mobile compared to many other elements (e.g., Fe, Mg), and diffusion has been considered as a mechanism to generate large isotopic fractionations even at high temperatures. In order to quantify some of these aspects, we have measured Li diffusion rates experimentally along [0 0 1] of single crystals of olivines from San Carlos, Arizona and Pakistan, at 800-1200 degrees C at a total pressure of 100 kPa and fO(2) approximate to WM buffer. A complex diffusion behavior of Li is observed, indicating that two mechanisms of diffusion (a fast and a slower one) operate Simultaneously. The behavior is well described by a model that partitions Li between two different sites in olivine - an octahedral site (Li(Me)) and an interstitial site (Li(i)). Transport of Li is a combination of hopping within and between each of these kinds of sites involving also vacancies on the octahedral site (V(Me)). It is assumed that the homogeneous reaction (Li(Me) = V(Me) + Li(i)) that maintains equilibrium distribution of Li between the sites is instantaneous compared to the timescales of all other processes associated with diffusive transport. One consequence of this mode of transport of Li in olivine is that the shape and length of diffusion profiles depend on the boundary conditions imposed at the surface of a crystal,- i.e., the chemical environment (e.g., fO(2), aLi(4)SiO(4)), in addition to temperature and pressure. Our model describes the variable experimentally determined Li-profile shapes produced at different temperatures and with different boundary conditions, as well as their time evolution, quantitatively. Modeling the observed isotopic fractionation shows that (6)Li diffuses about 5% faster than (7)Li on the interstitial site. Inspection of published data on Li distribution in natural olivines that are available until now indicates that the fast (interstitial) mechanism of Li diffusion is unlikely to be dominant in most natural systems; Li rich, oxidizing environments (e.g., fluids?) may be exceptions. However, when it operates it can decouple the equilibration of Li isotopic gradients from the time scale of equilibration of overall Li concentrations. Diffusion dominated by the slower mechanism will occur on the average at a rate that is about an order of magnitude faster than diffusion of Fe, Mg and most other divalent cations in olivine; such diffusion of Li in olivine will be much slower than the rates of diffusion in clinopyroxene and plagioclase crystals at the same conditions. Fractionation of isotopes of Li by diffusion is likely to be a transient phenomenon and is more likely to be observed in crystals showing zoning of Li concentrations. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Rizvi, Farhan; Heimann, Tom; O'Brien, William J.								Expression of NADPH Oxidase (NOX) 5 in Rabbit Corneal Stromal Cells								PLOS ONE				7	4					e34440	10.1371/journal.pone.0034440				APR 12 2012	2012	Purpose: To determine whether NOX 5 is expressed in rabbit corneal stromal cells (RCSC). NADPH oxidases (NOXes) are enzymes that preferentially use NADPH as a substrate and generate superoxide. Several isoforms of NOXes function as multi-protein complexes while NOX5 and DUOXs do not require the accessory proteins for their activity and possess calcium binding EF hands.Methods: Human NOX5 primers were used to amplify the rabbit NOX5 by RT-PCR. Amplified product was sequenced to confirm its identity. The protein encoded by the NOX5 was identified by western blot analysis. NOX5 siRNA was used to reduce transcript, protein, and calcium stimulated activity. In silico analyses were performed to establish the putative structure, functions, and evolution of rabbit NOX5.Results: NOX activity was measured in RCSC with NADPH rather than NADH as a substrate. RT-PCR with NOX5 primers amplified 288 bp product using RCSC cDNA, which, when sequenced, confirmed its identity to human NOX5 mRNA. This sequence was used to predict the rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculus) NOX5 gene. NOX5 siRNA reduced amounts of NOX5 mRNA in RCSC and reduced ionomycin stimulated superoxide production. A protein of about 65 to 70 kDa encoded by the NOX5 was detected by western blot analysis. In silico analysis predicted a putative rabbit NOX5 protein containing 801 amino acids. Motif searches predicted the presence of at least 3 putative EF-hands in N-terminus and a NOX domain in C terminal region.Conclusions: The data document that the NOX5 gene was expressed in cells of lagomorphs unlike rodents, making the rabbit an interesting model to study NOX5 functions. The activity of the rabbit NOX5 was calcium stimulated, a trait of NOX5 in general. NOX5 may also prove to be a useful genetic marker for studying the taxonomic position of lagomorphs and the Glires classification.									11	0	0	0	10	0	11			1932-6203			WOS:000305338600027	22511941	
J	Hwang, HJ; Burnap, RL								Multiflash experiments reveal a new kinetic phase of photosystem II manganese cluster assembly in Synechocystis sp PCC6803 in vivo								BIOCHEMISTRY				44	28			9766	9774		10.1021/bi050069p				JUL 19 2005	2005	The assembly of Mn2+ ions into the H2O oxidation complex (WOC) of the photosystern II (PSII) reaction center is a light-driven process, termed photoactivation. According to the "two-quantum" model, photoactivation involves two light-driven charge separations coupled to the photooxidation of Mn2+ in order to form the first stable intermediate in a process that culminates in the oxidative assembly of four Mn2+ ions and one Ca2+ ion to form the active, higher valence (Mn-4-Ca) center of the WOC. To better define the kinetics of the dark rearrangement and to gain some understanding of the basis for the very low quantum yield of the overall process, photoactivation experiments, involving different flash patterns, were conducted with Synechocystis sp. PCC6803. It was found that even the so-called first stable intermediate is readily lost during protracted (1 - 10 s) dark periods during photoactivation of Synechocystis cells. Low concentrations of the electron acceptor, DCBQ, improved the stability of the dark intermediates. The unstable photoactivation intermediates formed early in the photoactivation process were not, however, stabilized by the addition of Ca2+, although the overall yield of photoactivation is enhanced by the additional Ca2+. Measurements of the kinetics of fluorescence yield verify that Q(A)(-) to Q(B) electron transfer rates change during the course of photoactivation as the high potential form Of Q(A)(-) is converted to the low potential form and show that DCBQ acts as an efficient electron acceptor from Q(A)(-) even while in its high potential form. In addition the similar to 150 ms phase corresponding to the originally described dark rearrangement of photoactivation, repetitive, double flash experiments, with a 10 s intervening dark period, reveals a faster, 15 ms phase that is accentuated by DCBQ.									18	0	0	0	14	0	18			0006-2960			WOS:000230466000021	16008361

Millions of people have been infected and died from this infection. Until today, the pathophysiology and treatment of this infection remain unknown, but a lot of studies are trying to solve the mystery. The trail of inflammation remains the most convincing, especially the Interleukin 6 (IL-6) which could play an important role in a reaction cascade leading to a cytokine storm. According to studies, although few in number, the Tociluzimab (TCZ), which is an anti-IL6, could prevent or even suppress this storm, leading to a less severe clinical state of the disease and a faster recovery. This could decrease the use of oxygen, avoid the risk of intubation and mortality.Patients and methods: This single-center retrospective observational case review brought together 557 COVID-19 seriously ill patients (pulmonary involvement> 25% + SatO(2)AA <90%) admitted to the intensive care unit of our university hospital from March 1st, 2020 to February 28th, 2021. They were divided into 2 groups a Tociluzimab group (TCZ group) and a Non Tociluzimab group (NON TCZ) to facilitate the comparison. The aim of the study was to compare the length of hospital stay, the use of mechanical ventilation and the mortality in the TCZ group versus the NON TCZ group.Results: The average age of our patients was 62,05 years (+/- 13.51) and 62.61 years (+/- 16.33) respectively in the TCZ versus NON TCZ group. 76 (76%) were men while 24 were women (24%) in the TCZ group; and there was 313 (68.49%) men and 144 (31.51%) women in the NON TCZ group. Their average BMI was 28 kg/m2 (+/- 4.52) in the TCZ group versus 27.89 kg/m2 (+/- 4.73) in the NON TCZ group. Among them, the TCZ group included 38 (38%) diabetic patients, 38 hypertensive (38%), 12 heart disease (12%) and 2 chronic renal failure (2%), while the NON TCZ group regrouped 35 (7.65%) diabetics, 33 (7.22%) hypertensive, 12 heart disease (2.67%), and 5 chronic renal failure (1.09%) patients. The mean time to consultation of patients was almost similar in the two groups: 8.86 (+/- 7,28) days for TCZ and 8.83 (+/- 7,03) days for NON TCZ group. The mean length of ICU hospital stay was 9 days (4,94) for the TCZ group and 8,75 days (4,73) for the other one. The saturation at admission was at 74.92% (10.45) for the TCZ group ranging from 40% to 92%, and at 73,56% for the NON TCZ group. Lung damage from COVID-19 was extensive in 12%, severe in 32%, and critical in 56% of TCZ group enrolled cases. Meanwhile it was extensive in 23.63%, severe in 41,35%, and critical in 35,01% of the NON TCZ group. The biological findings found average of white blood cells at 12256/12082 e/mm(3), lymphocytes at 761/842 e/mm(3), CRP at 181/199 mg/L, ferritin at 1747/528 mu g/L, and fibrinogen at 6.92/6.27 g/L for the TCZ group versus NON TCZ group. Medical care was based on isolation, oxygenotherapy, azithromycin, vitamin C, zinc, vitamin D, salicylic acid, dexamethasone followed with methylprednisolone, and anticoagulation for all hospitalized patients. The TCZ group received at least 1 course of Tociluzimab dosed at 400 mg (2 patients received 2 doses and arguments: an increase in oxygen requirements, a progression of lesions on chest-computed tomography and an increase in inflammation markers including IL-6, CRP, ferritin, fibrinogen, and a decrease in the percentage of lymphocytes. The invasive mechanical ventilation was indicated for 4 (4%) patients in the TCZ group versus 192 (42,01%) in the NON TCZ. Among the 100 patients included in our cohort in the TCZ group, 40% died in intensive care unit and 60% had a favorable evolution with a decrease of the biological markers of inflammation. However, in the NON TCZ group, 197 (43,10%) passed away.Conclusion: The use of Tociluzimab in ICU patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia did not contribute to a significant difference in the reduction of hospital stay. However, the invasive mechanical ventilation was less needed in patients receiving Tociluzimab than the others. Moreover, there was a mortality benefit associated with the use of Tociluzimab, but only before 10 days of hospitalization.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2049-0801			WOS:000679346500001	34221397

The environmental effects of this warm event are here documented based on stable isotopes and quantitative analysis of planktonic foraminifera, at the South Atlantic DSDP Site 525A. Stable isotopes of individual species mark a rapid increase in temperature and a reduction in the vertical water mass stratification that is accompanied by a decrease in niche habitats, reduced species diversity and/or abundance, smaller species morphologies or dwarfing, and reduced photosymbiotic activity. During the warm event, the relative abundance of a large number of species decreased, including tropical-subtropical affiliated species, whereas typical mid-latitude species retained high abundances. This indicates that climate warming did not create favorable conditions for all tropical-subtropical species at mid-latitudes and did not cause a massive retreat in the local mid-latitude population. A noticeable exception is the ecological generalist Heterohelix dentata Stenestad that dominated during the cool intervals, but significantly decreased during the warm event. However, dwarfing is the most striking response to the abrupt warming and occurred in various species of different morphologies and lineages (e.g. biserial, trochospiral, keeled globotruncanids). Dwarfing is a typical reaction to environmental stress conditions and was likely the result of increased reproduction rates. Similarly, photosymbiotic activity appears to have been reduced significantly during the maximum warming, as indicated by decreased delta(13)C values. The foraminiferal response to climate change is thus multifaceted resulting in decreased species diversity, decreased species populations, increased competition due to reduced niche habitats, dwarfing and reduced photosymbiotic activity.

J	Burnap, RL; Qian, M; Pierce, C								The manganese-stabilizing protein of photosystem II modifies the in vivo deactivation and photoactivation kinetics of the H2O oxidation complex in Synechocystis sp PCC6803								BIOCHEMISTRY				35	3			874	882		10.1021/bi951964j				JAN 23 1996	1996	Dark deactivation and photoactivation of H2O-splitting activity were examined in a directed mutant (Delta psbO) of Synechocystis sp. PCC6803 lacking the extrinsic manganese-stabilizing protein of the photosystem Il (PSII) reaction center complex. Rapid (t(1/2) 10 min) losses of H2O-splitting activity were observed for Delta psbO cells kept in the dark, but not for wild-type cells. The loss of H2O-splitting activity by Delta psbO cells was suppressed by maintaining the cells under illumination and dark losses were rapidly (t1/2 < 1 min) reversed by light. Photoactivation kinetics of Delta psbO and wild-type cells were compared following hydroxylamine extraction of PSII Mn. Photoactivation of Delta psbO cells under continuous illumination occurs at an intrinsically faster rate (about LF-fold) than the wild-type. Virtually all of the increase in the rate of photoactivation can be accounted for by a corresponding Lt-fold increase in the relative quantum yield of photoactivation as indicated by the yield of photoactivation as a function of flash number. The flash frequency dependence of photoactivation indicates a multi-quantum process in the mutant resembling the wild-type, but with significant increases in yields at all flash frequencies examined. The higher quantum yield of photoactivation in Delta psbO cells occurs in the absence of large changes in the kinetics of the rate-limiting dark rearrangement. The results are consistent with increased accessibility (or affinity) and photooxidation of Mn2+ at one or both of the two binding sites involved in the initial stages of the photoactivation mechanism. Tn the context of previous results, it is proposed that MSP regulates the binding/photooxidation of the second Mn2+ of the photoligation sequence, but not the first.									69	1	0	0	61	0	69			0006-2960			WOS:A1996TR17800024	8547268

It gives rise to a recently identified EPR signal (symmetric line shape with width 163 +/- 5 G, g = 2.004 +/- 0.005), which forms in samples inhibited either by depletion of Ca2+ [Boussac, A., Zimmerman, J.-L., & Rutherford, A. W. (1989) Biochemistry 28, 8984-8989; Sivaraja, M., Tso, J., & Dismukes, G. C. (1989) Biochemistry 28, 9459-9464] or by substitution of Cl- by F- (Baumgarten, Philo, and Dismukes, submitted for publication). Further characterization of this EPR signal has revealed the following: (1)it forms independently of the local structure of the PSII acceptors; (2) it arises from photooxidation of a PSII species that donates an electron to Tyr-Z+ or to the Mn cluster in competition with an exogenous donor (DPC); (3) the Curie temperature dependence of the intensity suggests an isolated doublet ground state, attributable to a spin S = 1/2 radical; (4) the electron spin orientation relaxes 1000-fold more rapidly than typical for a free radical, exhibiting a strong temperature dependence of P1/2 (half-saturation power approximately T3.4) and a broad inhomogeneous line width; (5) it yields an undetectable change in the magnetic susceptibility upon formation by a laser flash; (6) it disappears in parallel with release of Mn during reduction with NH2OH, indicating that it forms only in the presence of the modified Mn cluster.One possible interpretation attributes this EPR signal to an unusual state of the Mn cluster not previously observed in synthetic Mn2, Mn3, or Mn4 clusters. However, the most likely possibility is a radical which is in dipolar contact with a rapidly relaxing spin center such as a transition ion. We attribute this to photooxidation of an amino acid residue located within 9 angstrom of the Mn cluster. Starting in dark-adapted samples exhibiting the modified multiline EPR signal (apparent S2' oxidation state),the 160-G EPR signal forms with variable yield (24-48%) on the first flash and in > 80% centers after two saturating flashes. It thus appears associated with both the S3' and S4' states. This signal decays in the dark to the S2' state. The radical signal slowly disappears upon multiple turnovers during continuous illumination and may be correlated with the onset of photoinhibition-the irreversible loss of O2 evolution. Photoinhibition occurs at a 17-fold faster rate than in normal PSII centers. We consider evidence suggesting that photooxidation of this species may occur during the normal mechanism of water oxidation.									22	0	0	0	19	0	22			0006-2960			WOS:A1991FL55000015	1851436

Two broad-range primer pairs were used for reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR) of partial subunit genes of chlorocatechol 1,2-dioxygenase and catechol 2,3-dioxygenase from RNA directly extracted from different groundwater and aquifer samples. Samples retrieved from the lowermost sections of the reactor columns, which were operated in upflow mode, were positive for the presence of chlorocatechol 1,2-dioxygenase and catechol 2,3-dioxygenase mRNA. On the other hand, chlorocatechol 1,2-dioxygenase RT-PCR products were detected in a larger part of each reactor column, up to a zone 5.5 m above the bottom. Phylogenetic analyses of these chlorocatechol 1,2-dioxygenase sequences clearly separated them into two main clusters, one of which was closely affiliated with the broad-spectrum chlorocatechol 1,2-dioxygenase from Pseudomonas chlororaphis RW71. Analysis of sequences obtained from RT-PCR products amplified with catechol 2,3-dioxygenase primers revealed that their closest relative was the chlorocatechol 2,3-dioxygenase gene cbzE from Pseudomonas putida GJ31 (A. E. Mars, J. Kingma, S. R. Kaschabek, W. Reineke, and D. B. Janssen, J.

Earlier results obtained with Neutral red as an indicator for pH transients in the thylakoid lumen led to a 1:0:1:2 pattern of proton release for the S0 --> S1:S1 --> S2:S2 --> S3:S3 --> (S4) --> S0 transitions of the water oxidizing enzyme. Recently, a new interpretation of the Neutral red signals has been presented, that led to a non-integer stoichiometry of proton release (Lavergne, J. and Rappaport, F. (1990) in Current Research in Photosynthesis (Baltscheffsky, M., ed.), Vol. I, pp. 873-876, Kluwer, Dordrecht). This new interpretation was based on the proposal that in stacked thylakoids the absorption changes of Neutral red reflect not only pH transients in the lumen, but also pH transients in the external partitions between the appressed membranes in grana stacks. The latter space was not accessible to the buffer bovine serum albumin which was used to quench pH transients in the bulk. This interpretation was scrutinized with both, stacked and totally unstacked membranes. In unstacked membranes, bovine serum albumin quenched pH transients at the outer side of the membrane very rapidly. Then, the pattern of proton release as detected with Neutral red revealed the proposed non-integer stoichiometry, in which a fraction of a proton (about 0.5) is released upon the S1 --> S2 transition and less than two protons (about 1.5) during the oxygen-evolving S3 --> (S4) --> S0 step.									38	0	0	0	29	0	38			0006-3002			WOS:A1991FP59000003

The two manganese compounds are the di-mu -oxo compound [L ' 2Mn(III)O(2)Mn(IV)L ' (2)](ClO4)(3), where L ' is 1,10-phenanthroline (Cooper, S. R.; Calvin, M. J. AI?I. Chem. Sec. 1977, 99, 6623- 6630) and the linear mono-mu -oxo compound [(LMnOMnL)-O-III-L-III] (ClO4)(2), where L- is the monoanionic N,N-bis(2-pyridylmethyl)-N ' -salicylidene 1,2-diaminoethane ligand (Horner, O.; Anxolabehere-Mallart, E.; Chariot, M. F.; Tchertanov, L.; Guilhem, J.; Mattioli, T. A.; Boussac, A.; Girerd, J.-J. Inorg. Chem. 1999, 38, 1222-1232). Preparative bulk electrolysis in acetonitrile was used to obtain higher oxidation states of the compounds: the (MnMnIV)-Mn-IV species for the di-mu -oxo compound and the (MnMnIV)-Mn-III and (MnMnIV)-Mn-IV species for the mono-mu -oxo compound. IR, UV/vis, EPR, and EXAFS spectra were used to determine the purity and integrity of the various sample solutions. The Mn K-edge XANES spectra shift to higher energy upon oxidation when the ligand environment remains similar. However, shifts in energy are also observed when only the ligand environment is altered. This is achieved by comparing the di-mu -oxo and linear mono-mu -oxo Mn-Mn moieties in equivalent oxidation states, which represent major structural changes. The magnitude of an energy shift due to major changes in ligand environment can be as large as that of an oxidation-state change. Therefore, care must be exercised when correlating the Mn K-edge energies to manganese oxidation states without taking into account the nature of the ligand environment and the overall structure of the compound. In contrast to Mn K-edge XANES, KP XES spectra show less dependence on ligand environment. The K beta (1,3) peak energies are comparable for the di-mu -oxo and mono-mu -oxo compounds in equivalent oxidation states. The energy shifts observed due to oxidation are also similar for the two different compounds. The study of the different behavior of the XANES pre-edge and main-edge features in conjunction with KP XES provides significant information about the oxidation state and character of the ligand environment of manganese atoms.									83	1	0	0	22	0	84			0002-7863	1520-5126		WOS:000169978900008	11459481

The thermochromic effect was induced by exposing the samples to either argon or air at specific temperatures within the range 25-300 degrees C. Optical absorption spectra indicated that the samples annealed in argon show a higher thermochromic response than the samples annealed in air. Moreover, the average luminous transmittance T*(lum) was investigated as a function of the annealing temperature, T-a. The highest change of T*(lum) was found in samples treated in argon, where T*(lum) shifted from 71.69% at room temperature (RT) to 44.58% at 300 degrees C. For samples treated in air, T*(lum) decreased from 71.69% at RT down to 67.47% at 200 degrees C, but increased up to 79.08% at 300 degrees C. In addition, the annealing in argon at 300 degrees C revealed the formation of two coloration bands around 550 nm and 900 nm, which are associated with an oxygen vacancy defect state (Mo5+O5) and an intervalence charge transfer transition of a hexa-coordinated defect state (Mo5+O6), respectively. Raman spectra, HR-TEM images, and X-ray diffraction measurements showed that the samples treated in air displayed mainly the orthorhombic alpha-MoO3 phase with small indications of the monoclinic beta-MoO3 phase, whereas the treatment in argon led to a mixture of beta-MoO3 and the Magneli phase Mo9O26. The dependence of the Mo5+ oxidation state on Ta, was analyzed by X-ray photoemission spectroscopy (XPS) using deconvolution methods. For the annealing in air, it was found that the Mo5+ signal of the Mo 3d(3/2) peak increased slightly from 25 to 200 degrees C but exhibited a steep decrease at 300 degrees C; on the contrary, this signal showed a slight increase in the whole range for the anoxic atmosphere. These results show that the Mo5+ oxidation state and the optical density display a similar dependence on Ta for both types of annealing atmosphere. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

With the availability of high specific surface area (SSA), well-balanced pore distribution, high conductivity, and tunable wettability, carbon-based nanomaterials are highly expected as advanced materials for energy conversion and storage to meet the increasing demands for clean and renewable energies. In this context, attention is usually attracted by the star material of graphene in recent years.In this Account, we overview our studies on carbon-based nanotubes to nanocages for energy conversion and storage, including their synthesis, performances, and related mechanisms. The two carbon nanostructures have the common features of interior cavity, high conductivity, and easy doping but much different SSAs and pore distributions, leading to different performances. We demonstrated a six-membered-ring-based growth mechanism of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) with benzene precursor based on the structural similarity of the benzene ring to the building unit of CNTs. By this mechanism, nitrogen-doped CNTs (NCNTs) with homogeneous N distribution and predominant pyridinic N were obtained with pyridine precursor, providing a new kind of support for convenient surface functionalization via N-participation. Accordingly, various transition-metal nanoparticles were directly immobilized onto NCNTs without premodification. The so-constructed catalysts featured high dispersion, narrow size distribution and tunable composition, which presented superior catalytic performances for energy conversions, for example, the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and methanol oxidation in fuel cells. With the advent of the new field of carbon-based metal-free electrocatalysts, we first extended ORR catalysts from the electron-rich N-doped to the electron-deficient B-doped sp(2) carbon. The combined experimental and theoretical study indicated the ORR activity originated from the activation of carbon pi electrons by breaking the integrity of pi conjugation, despite the electron-rich or electron-deficient nature of the dopants.With this understanding, metal-free electrocatalysts were further extended to the dopant-free defective carbon nanomaterials. Moreover, we developed novel 3D hierarchical carbon-based nanocages by the in situ MgO template method, which featured coexisting micro-meso-macropores and much larger SSA than the nanotubes. The unique 3D architecture avoids the restacking generally faced by 2D graphene due to the intrinsic pi-pi interaction. Consequently, the hierarchical nanocages presented superior performances not only as new catalyst supports and metal-free electrocatalysts but also as electrode materials for energy storage. State-of-the-art supercapacitive performances were achieved with high energy density and power density, as well as excellent rate capability and cycling stability. The large interior space of the nanocages enabled the encapsulation of high-loading sulfur to alleviate polysulfide dissolution while greatly enhancing the electron conduction and Li-ion diffusion, leading to top level performance of lithium-sulfur battery. These results not only provide unique carbon-based nanomaterials but also lead to in-depth understanding of growth mechanisms, material design, and structure-performance relationships, which is significant to promote their energy applications and also to enrich the exciting field of carbon-based nanomaterials.									171	26	0	0	12	0	172			0001-4842	1520-4898		WOS:000394724500031	28145692

The as-obtained CdFe2O4/g-C3N4 hybrid samples composed of CdFe2O4 nanoparticles and g-C3N4 nanosheets were systematically characterized by different techniques including X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscope, transmission electron microscope, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, UV-vis DRS, chemical oxygen demand, inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer, photochemical test and electron spin resonance spectrometer technique. The optimal photocatalytic activity for ceftiofur sodium photodegradation was achieved by modulating the weight ration between CdFe2O4 nanoparticles and g-C3N4 nanosheets. The result from photocatalytic tests indicate that CdFe2O4/g-C3N4-2 hybrid sample exhibit highly efficient photocatalytic activity towards ceftiofur sodium removal in comparison with pristine CdFe2O4 nanoparticles and pure g-C3N4 nanosheets. Meanwhile the excellent photocatalytic stability of CdFe2O4/g-C3N4-2 hybrid sample was also verified during recycling runs towards photocatalytic ceftiofur sodium degradation. The significant enhancement of photocatalytic activity was attributed to the Z-scheme charge separation and transfer based on the construction of tight heterogeneous interface and well-matched band potentials. We expect this research to provide a new insight into the design and preparation of direct Z-scheme hybrid photocatalysts for environmental remediation.

Designing critical and sophisticated materials is of great importance in order to realize high-performance energy technology. Typically, efficient synthesis and soft surface modification of nanomaterials are important for energy technology. Therefore, there are increasing demands on the rational design of efficient electrocatalysts or electrode materials, which are the key for scalable and practical electrochemical energy devices. Nevertheless, the development of versatile and cheap strategies is one of the main challenges to achieve the aforementioned goals. Accordingly, plasma technology has recently appeared as an extremely promising alternative for the synthesis and surface modification of nanomaterials for electrochemical devices. Here, the recent progress on the development of nonthermal plasma technology is highlighted for the synthesis and surface modification of advanced electrode materials for renewable energy technology including electrocatalysts for fuel cells, water splitting, metal-air batteries, and electrode materials for batteries and supercapacitors, etc.									339	29	0	0	13	0	343			0935-9648	1521-4095		WOS:000434032600004	29441673

The fundamental studies for the relationship between structure and photophysical properties of chlorophylls disclosed the importance of beta-peripheral modification and thus boosted the fast growth of NIR absorbing/emissive porphyrinoids via altering the extent of z-conjugation and the degree of distortion from the planarity of macrocycle. Despite the tremendous progress made in various porphyrin-based synthetic models, it still remains a challenge to precisely modulate photophysical properties through fine-tuning of beta-peripheral structures in the way natural chlorophylls do. With this in mind, we initiated a program and focused on meso-C6F5-substituted porpholactone (F20TPPL), in which one beta-pyrrolic double bond was replaced by a lactone moiety, as an attractive platform to construct the bioinspired library of NIR porphyrinoids.In this Account, we summarize our recent contributions to the bioinspired design, synthesis, photophysical characterization, and applications of porpholactones and their derivatives. We have developed a general, convenient method to directly prepare porpholactones in large scale up to gram, which forms the chemical basis of porpholactone chemistry. By modulation of the saturation level and in particular regioisomerization of beta-dilactone moieties, a synthetic library constituted by a series of porpholactones and their derivatives has been established. Thanks to the electron-withdrawing nature of lactone moiety, derivation of the saturation levels gives help to build stable models for chlorin, bacteriochlorin, and tunichlorin. It is worth noting that regioisomerization of dilactone moieties mimics the relative orientation of beta-substituents in natural chlorophylls and hemes, which was considered as the key factor to tune NIR absorption and reactivity. Porpholactones can illustrate the capability of fine-tuning photophysical properties including the excited triplet states by subtle alteration of beta-peripheral structures in the presence of transition metals and lanthanides (Ln). Furthermore, they can serve as efficient photosensitizers for singlet oxygen and NIR Ln, showing potential applications in cell imaging and photocytotoxicity studies. The high luminescence, tunable structures, high cellular uptake, and intense NIR absorption render them as promising and competitive candidates for theranostics in vitro and in vivo. Therefore, extending the studies of "porpholactone chemistry" not only tests the fundamental understanding of the structure-function relationship that governs NIR photophysical properties of natural tetrapyrrole cofactors such as chlorophylls but also provides the guiding principles for the bioinspired design of NIR luminescent molecular probes with various applications. Taken together, as a new synthetic porphyrin derivative, porpholactone chemistry shines light on synthetic porphyrin, bioinorganic, and lanthanide chemistry.									42	3	0	0	10	0	44			0001-4842	1520-4898		WOS:000487161900021	31298833

Inspired by the dealloying process to prepare nanoporous structures through selectively removing active metals from their alloy, we developed a method to prepare nanoporous Ag nanorods through chemical reduction of the electrodeposited Ag7O8NO3 nanorods using a strong reducing agent (e.g., NaBH4). The length and the thickness of the Ag7O8NO3 nanorods could be controlled by the electrodeposition voltage and time. Nitrogen and oxygen elements were immediately removed from Ag7O8NO3 nanorods by the reducing agent, leaving behind a tremendous number of nanopores with a mean size of 20 nm, which can efficiently trap and enrich analytes. Meanwhile, the densely packed nanopores can behave as SERS hot spots to provide strong SERS enhancement. The nanoporous Ag nanorods as SERS substrates were used to sensitively detect adenine, spike glycoprotein, and polychlorinated biphenyls pollutants, as well as identify different types of bacteria. The simple fabrication process and the outstanding SERS performance of the nanoporous Ag nanorods make them promising candidates for SERS applications towards trace detection of pollutants, narcotics, food additives, and biomolecules.									1	0	0	0	1	0	1			0956-5663	1873-4235		WOS:000796807600002	35078140

CdS with suitable band structure is expected to be an excellent candidate in photocatalytic water splitting to produce hydrogen, but fast recombination of photo-generated carries usually hinders its applications. Nb2CTX, with lower Fermi energy level than Ti3C2TX, has been used as co-catalyst for photocatalysis due to its excellent electroconductivity and hydrophilicity. In this work, a one-step solvothermal method is used to grow in-situ one-dimensional (1D) CdS nanorods on two-dimensional (2D) Nb2CTX under the action of electrostatically driven self-assembly, ensuring the intimate contact at the CdS/Nb2CTX interface to form the 1D/2D Schottky heterojunction. Correspondingly, the CdS/Nb2CTX composite helps to accelerate the separation of electron-hole and charge transfer of CdS, and thus improving its photocatalytic performance. The optimized CdS/Nb2CTX composite (CdS/Nb2CTX-60) presents enhanced photocatalytic activity with hydrogen production rate of 5.3 mmol.g(-1).h(-1) under visible light, which is 1.7 times higher than that of pristine CdS.									15	0	0	0	1	0	15			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000717527300003

We adopt a two-component picture of protoCAIs consisting of cores with the elemental abundances of type B1 CAIs (calcium-aluminum-rich inclusions) and mantles of less refractory material. The cores have a power-law distribution of sizes between R-min and R-max. The mantles have a uniform thickness, whose value is chosen to bring the total inventory of elements at least as refractory as sulfur to cosmic abundances for the entire population of protoCAIs. Each object is irradiated with a fluence consistent with the product of their residence time in the reconnection ring and the flux of solar cosmic rays obtained by a scaling of impulsive flares from the hard X-rays observed from low-mass protostars. For R-min in the 50 mum regime and R-max in the few centimeter regime, which corresponds to the range of sizes of observed CAIs in micrometeorites and chondrites, we recover approximately the canonical values quoted for the ratios Al-26/Al-27, Mn-53/Mn-55, and Ca-41/Ca-40 in CV3 meteorites. Moreover, the excess La-138 (denoted as La-138*) produced by proton bombardment of Ba-138 lies within the CAI range obtained in the experiments of Shen et al. When we include fragmentation reactions that produce Be-10 from the impact of protons, alphas, and He-3 on the O-16 that is bound up in rocks, we further obtain a level of Be-10/Be-9 that agrees approximately with the report of McKeegan et al. for a CAI from the Allende meteorite. Similar calculations for the expected anomalies in the stable isotopes of lithium show rough consistency with the measured values and further support our interpretation. The value for Be-10/Be-9 is particularly difficult to produce by any other astrophysical mechanism. Thus, the Be-10 discovery greatly strengthens the case for an origin in early solar-system irradiation, rather than external stellar seeding, for the shortest-lived radionuclides inferred from CAIs in chondritic meteorites.									180	3	0	0	4	0	183			0004-637X	1538-4357		WOS:000167204900044

The absorbencies of Rf solutions at maximum wavelengths of 330 and 470 nm were used to estimate the Rf photodegradation extent. Greater degradation extents were obtained by the absorbencies recorded at 470 nm. The percentage of the composite components varied the photodegradation efficiency, and the composite containing 60% g-C3N4 (G60) showed the highest activity. The best photodegradation results obtained at CRf: 2 ppm, solution pH: 5.5, catalyst dose: 1 g/L, irradiation time: 10 min. The solutions with degradation extents of 96 and 97% showed the mineralization extents of 96.4 and 98.2%, calculated from the COD results. The photodegradation pathway obeyed the direct Z-Scheme mechanism. This mechanism pathway was theoretically evaluated for the probable ability of the composite for the hydrogen production and water splitting. The potential of the CB positions (Ag3PO4:-1.08 V, g-C3N4: 0.21 V) confirms that the accumulated electrons in CB-Ag3PO4 position are stronger reducing agent than that of g-C3N4 for the reduction of dissolved oxygen to the superoxide radicals and they are also capable of reducing water molecules or protons to hydrogen molecules.

X-ray diffraction analysis showed that the as-deposited Bi2Ti2O7 films were amorphous in nature; however, post-deposition annealing at 600 degrees C for 12 h significantly increased the crystallinity to give phase pure Bi2Ti2O7. Scanning electron microscopy revealed that the as-deposited film had a cauliflower-like structure with features ranging from 0.5 to 1.0 mu m in size. It was found that the post-annealing step sintered the features together reducing the pores in the structure and giving rise to larger features of 1.0-2.0 mu m in size. Optical studies showed that the Bi2Ti2O7 film had a direct band gap of 2.74 eV. The photoelectrochemical properties of Bi2Ti2O7 were tested and it was found that the electrodes exhibited a photocurrent density of 1.8 mu A cm(-2) at 0.23 V vs. Ag vertical bar AgCl. Results showed that Bi2Ti2O7 is an attractive material for photoelectrochemical water splitting. (C) 2014 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

The flexibility in control over varying length scales from atomic scale up to bulk structure allows access to an almost endless variety of MOF-based and MOF-derived materials. Indeed, MOFs themselves have been studied as a class of useful functional materials. More remarkably, extensive research conducted in recent years has shown that MOFs are exceptionally good precursors for a large variety of nanohybrids as active materials in both electrocatalysis and energy storage. As they already contain both carbon and well-dispersed metal atoms, MOFs can be converted to conductive carbons decorated with active metal species and doping elements through appropriate pyrolysis. Due to the great diversity accessible in the composition, structure, and morphology of MOFs, several types of MOF-derived nanohybrids are now among the best performing materials both for electrocatalysts and electrodes in various energy conversion and storage devices. In addition to mesoporous nano-carbons, both doped and undoped, carbon-metal nanohybrids, and carbon-compound nanohybrids, there are several types of core@shell, encapsulated nanostructures, embedded nanosystems and heterostructures that have been developed from MOFs recently. They can be made in either free-standing forms, nano-or micro-powders, grown on appropriate conducting substrates, or assembled together with other active materials. During the MOF to active material conversion, other active species or precursors can be inserted into the MOF-derived nanostructures or assembled on surfaces, leading to uniquely new porous nanostructures. These MOF-derived active materials for electrocatalysis and energy storage are nanohybrids consisting of more than functional components that are purposely integrated together at desired length scales for much-improved performance. This article reviews the current status of these nanohybrids and concludes with a brief perspective on the future of MOF-derived functional materials.									174	15	0	0	12	0	179			1359-7345	1364-548X		WOS:000432944100002	29582028	
J	Ulmer, Peter; Kaegi, Ralf; Muntener, Othmar				Ulmer, Peter/G-4694-2018	Ulmer, Peter/0000-0001-9131-0669			Experimentally Derived Intermediate to Silica-rich Arc Magmas by Fractional and Equilibrium Crystallization at 1.0 GPa: an Evaluation of Phase Relationships, Compositions, Liquid Lines of Descent and Oxygen Fugacity								JOURNAL OF PETROLOGY				59	1			11	58		10.1093/petrology/egy017				JAN 2018	2018	Differentiation of hydrous primary, mantle-derived magmas is a fundamental process to generate evolved intermediate to SiO2-rich compositions forming the bulk of the continental and island arc crust. This study focuses on the results of equilibrium and fractional crystallization experiments at 1.0GPa using two different primary magmas representing deep (90 km) and shallow (35 km) mantle extraction depths. Experiments on a hydrous high-Mg basalt were conducted at graphite-saturated and more oxidized conditions (NNO to NNOthorn2, where NNO is nickel-nickel oxide buffer) to exploit the influence of fO2 on phase assemblages and the evolution of derivative liquids. The liquid line of descent (LLD) was simulated from liquidus to near-solidus conditions ranging from 1330 degrees C to 720 degrees C. H2O contents varied from about 2.0 to more than 10wt %. The LLD covers the entire compositional range from high-Mg basalt to high-silica rhyolite and evolves from metaluminous to peraluminous compositions at 56-60wt % SiO2 under oxidizing conditions. The observed crystallization sequences and the LLD reveal contrasting behavior depending on oxidation state, H2O content and equilibrium versus fractional crystallization. Equilibrium crystallization of high-Mg basalt under reducing conditions is initially dominated by olivine fractionation followed by Cr-rich spinel, clinopyroxene (cpx), and orthopyroxene (opx). Finally, between 1060 and 1000 degrees C, amphibole formed by a peritectic reaction consuming cpxthornolivine and forming amphibolethornopx, resulting in 16% silica-undersaturated trachy-basaltic liquid. Equilibrium crystallization of the same composition under oxidizing conditions is characterized by strongly enhanced olivine and cpx fractionation and suppression of opx only occurring as a result of the peritectic amphibole-forming reaction at and below 1040 degrees C. The liquid at 980 degrees C is a peraluminous, alkali-poor, high-Al andesite representing.15% residual liquid. Fractional crystallization of the high-Mg basalt under oxidizing conditions evolves through fractionation of early olivine joined by cpx at 1200 degrees C, followed by opx and hercynitic spinel (1140-1080 degrees C) and amphibole at 1050 degrees C coexisting with cpx (and spinel) to 980 degrees C. At 950 degrees C both garnet and plagioclase (plag) join amphibole as liquidus phases. This paragenesis (plus ilmenite and apatite) persists to 750 degrees C with 16% residual liquid relative to the initial basaltic composition. Liquids evolve continuously from basalt to rhyolite, crossing the metaluminous-peraluminous boundary at about 60wt % SiO2. Fractional crystallization of the basaltic andesite starting material differs at high temperature, where opx and cpx are the liquidus phases (1200-1080 degrees C), followed by amphibole at the expense of opx. Below 950 degrees C the phase assemblage is identical except at the lowest temperature (720 degrees C), where quartz saturates in a high-silica rhyolitic liquid representing 20% of the initial basaltic andesite. Liquid compositions of the two starting compositions converge below 950 degrees C, with the exception of K2O, which behaves incompatibly along the liquid line of descent. The H2O-undersaturated fractional crystallization experiments on the high-Mg basaltic composition under relatively reducing conditions evolve towards tholeiitic or alkalic compositions owing to early plagioclase (at 1140 degrees C) and abundant opx (at 1110 degrees C) crystallization followed by garnet-cpx-plag-ilmenite at 1080 degrees C.Closed-system equilibrium crystallization under relatively oxidized conditions is characterized by significant expansion of the olivine stability field (> 250 degrees C, 1280-1000 degrees C) relative to more reducing conditions, causing depletion of the liquid in ferrous iron and increase of ferric iron. The resulting fO(2) of the coexisting basaltic liquids increases by more than 3 log units from about NNOthorn2 to NNO+5 5 over the temperature range > 1200-1040 degrees C, potentially offering an explanation for the more oxidized character of hydrous arc magmas as opposed to low-H2O tholeiitic magmas.									116	6	0	0	1	0	119			0022-3530	1460-2415		WOS:000433240400003

A nickel-substituted cobalt-borate nanowire array is developed on carbon cloth (Ni-Co-Bi/CC) via oxidative polarization of NiCo2S4 nanoarray in potassium borate (K-Bi). As a bimetallic electrocatalyst for water oxidation, such Ni-Co-Bi/CC is superior in catalytic activity and durability in 0.1 M K-Bi (pH: 9.2), with a turnover frequency of 0.33 mol O-2 s(-1) at the overpotential of 500 mV and nearly 100% Faradaic efficiency. To drive a geometrical catalytic current density of 10 mA cm(-2), it only needs overpotential of 388 mV, 34 mV less than that for Co-Bi/CC, outperforming reported non-noble-metal catalysts operating under benign conditions. Notably, its activity is maintained over 80 000 s. Density functional theory calculations suggest that the O* to OOH* conversion is the rate-determining step and Ni substitution decreases the free energy on Co-Bi from 2.092 to 1.986 eV.									84	5	0	0	2	0	84			1613-6810	1613-6829		WOS:000404553100012	28508425

Here we demonstrated that the performance of nanostructured PtRu catalyst for methanol oxidation could be significantly improved by CoP material; the presence of CoP could largely slow down the loss of Ru and Pt in PtRu catalyst system, thus promising a highly active and durable performance in DMFCs. Cyclic Voltammetry results showed the peak current is 2.89 times higher than that of state-of-the-art commercial PtRu/C-JM (231.9 mA mg(PtRu)(-1)) and 3.86 times higher than that of the home-made reference (PtRu/C-H) catalyst (173.6 mA mg(PtRu)(-1)); kinetics study probed by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy showed a large reduced charge transfer resistance in the rate determining step. The highest maximum power density was achieved on this novel PtRu-CoP/C catalyst among all the evaluated catalysts at different temperatures. Specifically, a maximum power density of 85.7 mW cm(-2) achieved at 30 degrees C is much higher than that of state-of-the-art commercial PtRu/C catalyst at 70 degrees C (63.1 mW cm(-2)). Outstanding catalytic activity and stability observed on this novel PtRu-CoP/C catalyst should be attributed to a synergistic effect between the nanostructured PtRu and CoP, in which the presence of CoP increases PtRu physical stability and anti-CO poisoning ability. The present work is a significant step that opens an avenue in the development of highly active and durable catalysts for fuel cells technology, and makes PtRu catalyst system much closer for commercial application in DMFCs.

A recently established strategy for dealing with this issue is to drill depth transects in anomalously shallowly buried and therefore presumably well-preserved target sediments. Here we report the results of an experiment designed to test the validity of this approach. We apply a simple one-dimensional numerical model to complex pore water chemical profiles (for Ca, Mg, Sr, Sr-87/Sr-86, and delta O-18) observed in a shallowly buried paleoceanographic transect of paleogene and Cretaceous age drilled on Blake Nose during Ocean Drilling Program Leg 171B. We show that it is possible to reproduce these complex pore water profiles simply by invoking (1) a deep-seated zone of chemical reaction well below the recovered sections and (2) minimal chemical alteration within the overlying recovered sediments but significant restriction of advective flow by embedded low-porosity layers. These results suggest that the sediments recovered during Ocean Drilling Program Leg 171B can be considered to be virtually chemically inert at their present burial depth (their carbonate recrystallization histories having been largely limited to events during early, similar to 10 Ma timescale, burial. These findings support the strategy of selecting unusually shallowly buried sections for paleoceanographic transect drilling. Ironically, however, the very attraction of targeting such sections (the lack of overlying sediments) dictates that it is not possible to use pore water chemistry to constrain the early diagenetic histories of such sections because of the diffusion of the pore water signal through the sediment-water interface. Diffusional loss may also account for the absence of pore water chemical anomalies associated with the ooze-chalk transition at Blake Nose. However, our work suggests that traditional interpretations of this boundary as the inferred locus of maximum rates of carbonate recrystallization require reevaluation.									33	0	0	0	2	0	33			0883-8305			WOS:000172863900002

The effects of OLRs on microbial community changes were also examined. The highest volumetric removal rate (13.3 kg COD/m(3) d) and the highest thermo-stable protease activity (0.95 unit/mL) were detected at OLR = 18.6 kg COD/m(3) d. Denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) profiles and quantitative PCR (qPCR) results showed significant microbial community shifts in response to changes in OLR. In particular, DGGE and phylogenetic analysis demonstrate that the presence of Bacillus sp. (phylum of Firmicutes) was strongly correlated with efficient removal of organic particulates from high-strength food wastewater. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

However, the importance of innate immune sensors in detecting intracellular parasites, such as Plasmodium spp., has only recently emerged as a central topic in the field of host-pathogen interactions. Genetic dissection of innate immune pathways has uncovered a complex relationship between the host innate immune system and Plasmodium blood-stage parasites. In fact, recognition molecules of the innate immune system, such as toll-like receptors, might not only be implicated in host defense but also in the pathogenesis of the disease. Whether Plasmodium liver stage parasites are recognised and controlled by the host innate immune system remains to be discovered. In this review we discuss recent findings on how the host innate immune system may sense and fight the different forms of Plasmodium and how the latter may have evolved mechanisms to escape host detection and/or to manipulate the defensive reaction of the host.

Integrating a large area of intercontact g-C3N4/CdS heterojunction with an intimate connection between the photocatalysts and the substrate, the separation and migration of the photogenerated carriers by g-C3N4 and CdS are significantly improved, and the internal resistance of the photoanode is effectively reduced. The optimal g-C3N4/CdS photoanode exhibits an excellent visible light photocurrent density of 5.4 mA cm(-2) at 0.0 V bias (vs. Ag/AgCl) and the photoelectrochemical H-2 production rate reaches 81.1 mmol h(-1) cm(-2). Moreover, the stability of this interlocking g-C3N4/CdS photoanode not only reflects in a 9-hour long time recycling photoelectrochemical H-2 production test, but also in an outstanding steady structure which even be stabilized in an ultrasonic treatment. The present study provides a practical and convenient technique to develop such an earth abound and low-cost CdS/C3N4 photoanode which can be used for high efficiency and stable photoelectrochemical solar energy conversion.

Atomic force microscopy results reveal that the films with different thickness have fundamentally different grain size distribution (samples with the film thickness less than 50 nm have single mode grain size distribution, while samples with the film thickness more than 50 nm have multi-mode distribution of grain size). The correlation between grain size of nanosilicon films, photoluminescence and scattering indicatrix was shown. Well-isolated vibronic structures were observed on the ultraviolet visible photoluminescence spectrum from nanosilicon films with the thickness more than 10 nm. The photoluminescence spectra in the red range correlate with the nanosilicon grain size distribution due to the effect of the quantum confinement. However, due to the complex shape of the grains mathematical modeling of photoluminescence spectrum is complicated. Both scattering indicatrix and photoluminescence reveal the multi-mode grain size distribution of the films with thickness more than 50 nm. The comparative analysis of theoretical results of optical radiation scattering by nanosilicon films with experimental ones is illustrated. Mathematical modeling of the scattering indicatrix shows the correlation of average grain size from scattering and photoluminescence data. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

J	Liu, Tingting; Li, Mian; Dong, Peng; Zhang, Yingjie; Guo, Liping				Peng, Dong/AFM-6518-2022				Design and facile synthesis of mesoporous cobalt nitride nanosheets modified by pyrolytic carbon for the nonenzymatic glucose detection								SENSORS AND ACTUATORS B-CHEMICAL				255				1983	1994		10.1016/j.snb.2017.08.218				FEB 2018	2018	In this paper, we have designed and facilely synthesized the novel mesoporous cobalt nitride nanosheets modified by the pyrolytic carbon conductor (denoted as Co2N0.67 NSs). By the hydrothermal method, we successfully grown the precursor nanosheets (i.e. Co(OH)(2) NSs) under the regulate and control of hexamethylenetetramine (HMT) weak base. Through a simple nitridation process in NH3 atmosphere at 400W degrees C, the as-prepared smooth Co(OH)(2) NSs were thoroughly transformed into the mesoporous Co2N0.67 NSs modified by pyrolytic carbon of HMT. Thanks to a synergistic effect between the metallic character of Co2N0.67 phase and good electroconductibility of carbon, the as-prepared hybrid Co2N0.67 NSs can boost electron transfer from catalyst surfaces and then form abundant Co4+ active sites on electrode surfaces in electrochemical reaction processes. Meanwhile, vast mesoporous structures appeared in Co(2)N(0.6)7 NSs further promoted the dispersion of Co4+ active sites and enhanced the mass transfer rate. Benefitting from the above mentioned factors, Co2N0.67 NSs therefore exhibit excellent glucose oxidation ability than another two control samples (i.e. Co(OH)(2) NSs and Co3O4 NSs). When used for glucose detection after the electrochemical activation process, the optimal Co2N0.67 NSs display excellent detection parameters: a wide linear range of 0.01-8.0 mM, a large sensitivity of 921.18 uA cm(-2)mM(-1) glucose, a low detection limit of 0.1 mu M, a response time within 3 s, good reproducibility, considerable long-term stability, and excellent anti-interference to electroactive molecules and Cl-. Upon utilized for measuring glucose concentrations in serum samples, the detection results on Co2N0.67 NSs are similarly satisfying and accurate.

XPS, HRTEM, and BET results revealed that the carbon shell effectively protects the metallic core from oxidation while providing a porous structure that yields a high surface area, which in turn enhances the catalytic activity. Through material analysis, we established a link between synthesis conditions and resulting morphology, electronic and crystal structure of the outer layers of Ni@C NPs. Thanks to the optimum morphology and favorable shell electronic structure, Ni@C(15%) showed superior catalytic activity. An electrolyzer based on bifunctional Ni@C(15%) required only 1.71 V of voltage to deliver 10 mA cm(-2). The overpotential for water splitting is 0.12 V lower than that for a Ni benchmark electrolyzer. A stable and scalable PV-electrolysis system for water splitting that is fully based on all-inorganic CIGS PV and Ni@C(15%) was constructed. Water splitting is driven at a high current of similar to 10 mA under the illumination of 100 mW cm(-2), corresponding to a solar-to-hydrogen (STH) efficiency of 8.14% with 11.65% efficiency of the sub-module at the operating point. The efficiency of the STH device can be increased up to 10% by increasing the operating current through a further decrease of the Ni@C(15%) catalyst overpotential by optimization of its electronic structure.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000695664300001

It has also been shown in the modulation of chemotaxis, T lymphocyte differentiation, and leukocyte migration. In fish, NPY expression and functions have been studied but its immunomodulatory role remains undescribed. This study confirmed the expression and synthesis of NPY in S. solar under inflammation, and validated a commercial antibody for NPY detection in teleost Additionally, immunomodulatory effects of NPY were assayed in vitro and in vivo. Phagocytosis and superoxide anion production in leukocytes and SHK cells were induced under stimulation with a synthetic peptide. IL-8 mRNA was selectively and strongly induced in the spleen, head kidney, and isolated cells, after in vivo challenge with NPY. All together suggest that NPY is expressed in immune tissues and modulates the immune response in teleost fish. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Yue, Dehuai; Yang, Bin								Enhanced catalytic properties of Pt-based electrode by doped Cu and Ce								MATERIALS RESEARCH EXPRESS				4	8					085021	10.1088/2053-1591/aa828f				AUG 2017	2017	Novel PtCuCeOx composite membrane electrode materials were fabricated on the surface of graphite fibrous cloth by ion beam sputtering (IBS). The cyclic voltammetry (CV) and linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) were used to analyze the influence of doped Cu and Ce on the membrane electrocatalysis performance in a tri-electrode system. The phase composition, surface structure, interfacial structure and catalytic performance of PtCuCeOx membrane were studied by x-ray diffraction (XRD) and high resolution transmission electron microscope (HR-TEM&STEM). The results indicate that surface particles of membrane electrode are made up of PtCu alloy grains and a few CeOx grains, and the interface structure of oxide metal is formed between them. The crystal plane spacing between PtCu alloy grain is reduced by about 1.11% after the corrosion, which helps increase the electron density on Pt atom. As a result, the catalysis capability of PtCu alloy is enhanced. When the content of Ce is less than or equal to 0.28 wt.%, CeOx exists in the form of amorphous. It is exciting to demonstrate that the existence of CeOx enhances the dispersion of PtCuCeOx catalyst particles. The experimental results reveal that the synthesized material possesses the best electrochemical activity surface area (ESA) and exchange current density (i(0)). Compared to pure Pt catalyst, this PtCuCeOx catalyst contains much less Pt content (only 42% of Pt catalyst). However, the electrochemical performance is enhanced by 71.8% compared with pure Pt.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			2053-1591			WOS:000407774600001

The methods estimate the photochemical efficiency of photosystem II from ratios of fluorescence levels. Flashes of light that are transiently saturating for photochemistry (i.e. they are sufficiently bright to close all PSII reaction centres) are used to obtain the maximum fluorescence level. The type of saturating flash differs between methods. In one approach, single turnover (ST) flashes are applied. This allows only one charge separation during the flash and reduces only the primary acceptor of PS II, raising fluorescence to a level F (ST). In a second approach the flashes are multiple turnover (MT), which allow repeated charge separation processes until all electron acceptors of PS II are reduced. A relaxation of quenching is induced by the longer flash, and this raises the maximum fluorescence to a higher level, F(m(MT)). Application of the different approaches to an algal sample will result in differing F(m) values and, as a result, different values for the photochemical efficiency of PS II, with the MT method giving higher values than ST. Several designs of equipment, based on MT or ST techniques, are available for use with phytoplankton or benthic algae. Both techniques measure variable fluorescence, but there are a number of important differences in the methods used to calculate photosynthetic rates. In our view, this necessitates the use of a different terminology in order to avoid confusion, until the underlying physiological differences are resolved. An example is given showing that combining terminology from the different approaches will result in calculation of erroneous photosynthetic electron transport rates.									253	4	0	0	228	3	260			0967-0262			WOS:000184702900002

In this work, we utilize dual quantum dots (QDs), consisting of BiVO4 and carbon, to fabricate a hybrid homojunction-based BiVO4 photoanode for efficient and stable solar water oxidation. Formation of homojunctions, by decorating as-prepared BiVO4 substrate with BiVO4 QDs, enhances the charge separation efficiency by 1.3 times. This enhancement originates from lattice match, which benefits charge transfer across the interface. Furthermore, the use of carbon QDs as a stable photosensitizer effectively extends the photon absorption limit from 520 nm to over 700 nm, yielding an incident photon-to-electron conversion efficiency of 6.0 %, even at 600 nm at 1.23 V versus RHE. Finally, a remarkable photocurrent density of 6.1 mA cm(-2) at 1.23 V was recorded after depositing FeOOH/NiOOH as cocatalysts, thereby, reaching 82 % of the theoretical efficiency for BiVO4.									16	0	0	0	3	0	16			1864-5631	1864-564X		WOS:000461895100015	30684303

The key issue is exploring effective methods to improve their electrocatalytic activity. Herein, we report a new type of P-doped Ni(OH)(2)/NiMoO4 hierarchical nanosheet array (abbr. P-Ni(OH)(2)/NiMoO4) grown on Ni foam (NF), which can act as a highly efficient electrocatalyst towards overall water splitting. Such a composite was obtained by a three-step preparation process. In the first two hydrothermal reactions, the crystalline Ni(OH)(2) hierarchical nanosheet arrays were grown on NF and then the low crystallinity NiMoO4 was grafted on the Ni(OH)(2) nanosheets. In the third phosphorization step, P element was doped into the composite Ni(OH)(2)/NiMoO4. Electrocatalytic experiments show that P-Ni(OH)(2)/NiMoO4 possesses a smaller overpotential (60 mV) and lower Tafel slope (130 mV dec(-1)) toward HER in 1 M KOH. When it was employed as an integrated water splitting catalyst, only a potential of 1.55 V was required to achieve a current density of 10 mA cm(-2). This catalytic activity is even better than those of electrolyzers constructed with noble metals Pt/C vertical bar IrO2. The superior electrocatalytic performance of P-Ni(OH)(2)/NiMoO4 can be attributed to the high quality of crystalline Ni(OH)(2) nanosheet arrays grown on NF, which dramatically improve the conductivity. Furthermore, the hierarchical structure not only increases the surface area and exposes more catalytically active sites, but also provides a superaerophobic surface, which helps to accelerate the release of generated bubbles. Moreover, the synergistic effects between P-Ni(OH)(2) and P-NiMoO4 efficiently promote the HER and OER processes also. This work may suggest new a way to explore TM oxide/hydroxide-based durable electrocatalysts with highly efficient electrocatalytic activities towards overall water splitting.									42	7	0	0	0	0	46			1477-9226	1477-9234		WOS:000437317700035	29916509

However, the practical application of LDH nanosheets has been inhibited by the notorious inter-particle aggregation and poor charge transport between active materials and current collectors. In this work, 3D nickel-iron layered double hydroxide (NiFe-LDH) nanosheet films with porous nanostructures were synthesized using a hydrothermal method. The ultrathin nanosheets are homogeneously and vertically aligned on the surface of Ni foam. The pseudocapacitors assembled using NiFe-LDH nanosheets exhibit a superior specific capacitance of 2708 F g(-1) at 5 A g(-1), higher than the previously reported LDHs. The effect of growth concentration and Ni/Fe mole ratio on the electrochemical properties was also investigated. Asymmetric supercapacitors with the NiFe-LDH nanosheets film as the positive electrode and active carbon as the negative electrode display a high energy density of 52 Wh kg(-1) at an average power density of 800 W kg(-1). When two aqueous asymmetric supercapacitors were assembled in series and charged for only 1 min, the stored energy was capable of powering two green light-emitting-diodes for more than 5 min, indicating the great potential of these 3D NiFe-LDH nanosheets for high-performance energy storage.

J	Brookes, HC; Carruthers, CM; Doyle, TB								The electrochemical and electrocatalytic behaviour of glassy metals								JOURNAL OF APPLIED ELECTROCHEMISTRY				35	9			903	913		10.1007/s10800-005-4726-5				SEP 2005	2005	The suitability of a selection of amorphous alloys as electrocatalysts or as inhibitors for hydrogen evolution (HE) was investigated in 1 M KOH at 25 degrees C. Mild basic conditions were chosen so as to make direct comparison with other data, where available. The alloys studied were the known glassy alloys Fe67Co18B14Si1, Co66Fe4Si16B12Mo2, Fe40Ni40B20 and Fe40Ni40P14B6 and an entirely new glassy alloy Zr73.22Ti19.71Cu1.24Fe5.83. The electrochemical techniques of slow sweep anodic and cathodic polarisation were used, in conjunction with the surface analysis techniques of scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and X-ray analysis, to characterise the alloys and new data has been obtained for all alloys. The glassy alloys were tested in their as-polished state, as well as after surface activation, by ex situ chemical (acid etching) and in situ electrochemical (anodic oxidation in base) pre-treatment. The least corrosion resistant composition, Fe67Co18B14Si1, displayed the highest activity for HE in the as-polished state and only a minor improvement resulted from surface pre-treatment. Corrosion resistance was partly characterised by the degree to which the passive region increased and the passive region current decreased as a function of pre-treatment. The most corrosion resistant alloy, Zr73.22Ti19.71Cu1.24Fe5.83, displayed the poorest activity for HE in the as-polished state, but a significant improvement resulted from surface activation by in situ anodic oxidation in basic media. Surface activation by acid pre-treatment reduced the corrosion resistance of the Zr73.22Ti19.71 Cu1.24Fe5.83 alloy and was, therefore, a non-viable and destructive procedure. However, acid pre-treatment was effective in substantially activating the glassy Co66Fe4Si16B12Mo2 and Fe40Ni40P14B6 alloys towards HE and did not alter the corrosion properties of these compositions. A novel technique for mounting thin alloy specimens has been developed, using an insulating photo-resist coating, resulting in sharply defined electrode edges.									11	0	0	0	0	0	11			0021-891X			WOS:000230069700010

The solutions used to prepare the electrodes were obtained by mixing of the precursor salts with a mixture of ethylene glicol and citric acid. The films were burned at 400 degrees C and characterized by X-ray diffraction, scanning electronic microscopy, energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy and cyclic voltammetry. The electrodes were submitted to high anodic current density in order to evaluate their lifetime in perchloric acid solution. Results show that the electrodes present compositions similar to that of the precursor solutions, suggesting that there is no loss of tin during the calcination step. The electrodes had large surface area and higher lifetime in comparison with electrodes of similar composition prepared by other methods. The possible mechanisms involved in deactivation of the electrodes are discussed.									21	3	0	0	3	1	24			0021-891X			WOS:000239038400004

High magnification TEM micrographs showed that the morphology of the as-grown B/N-MWCNTs was affected by the doping temperature. For instance, low temperatures (700-800 degrees C) led to growth of B/N-MWCNTs exhibiting the two-compartment morphology, comprising a bamboo-like tubular inner compartment and a coiled flower-like outer compartment. At 900 degrees C, an alignment and restructuring of the coiled flower-like outer compartment occurred and resulted in growth of tubular and thicker B/N-MWCNTs. XPS data analysis corroborated this finding by indicating the incorporation of stable boron and nitrogen configurations, such as h-BN, BCN and graphitic-N, into the carbon lattice with increasing temperature. The optical analyses of B/N-MWCNTs were in good agreement with the XPS data, by depicting that the optical properties were governed by the type and amount of bonding states within the carbon lattice. Finally, thermal analysis studies revealed that the B/N-MWCNTs were more thermally stable owing to the incorporation of B atoms. Thus, the study illustrated that by adjusting the doping temperature, the properties, such as the optical properties, which are usually difficult to adjust for MWCNTs, could be tuned.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			1388-0764	1572-896X		WOS:000486155900001

In particular, grain boundaries facilitates superior synergistic effects of different crystals. This work proposes an ingenious binder strategy to introduce grain boundaries in metal/semiconductor (M/MOx,M = Co, Ni) architectures via the thermal calcination of layered Co/Ni glycerolates bonded by melamine. XAFS and HRTEM results illustrate the abundant grain boundaries and disordered regions among the different crystals. DFT calculations demonstrate that the metal/semiconductor composite has metallic electrical conductivity with fast electron mobility, and the deformation of the electronic structure at the interface produces abundant reactive sites to improve the intrinsic activity. Therefore, this architecture (CoNim) shows excellent properties for electrocatalytic OER and ORR with a potential gap of 0.72 V at 10 mA cm(-2), good stability (>13 h for OER and >29 h for ORR) and perfect selectivity (electron transfer number, N = 4.0). As an air electrode for Zn-air batteries, it shows a long discharge time (23 h) and a peak power density of 81.7 mW cm(-2). The facile binder strategy provides a new defect manufacturing method for the development of highly efficient bifunctional nanomaterials to be applied in energy devices.									21	2	0	0	1	0	21			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000467249200060

The data obtained were analyzed and estimates of the splitting parameters of the non-heme Fe2+ spin sublevels obtained. The study confirms the similarities of the g = 1.8 Qa iron-semiquinone signal (D/k = 15.6 K, Elk = 3.3 K) formed in formate-treated plant photosystem 2 to the signal found in purple bacteria. However, the g = 1.9 Qa iron-semiquinone signal (D/k = 7.1 K, E/k = << 1 K), formed in photosystem 2 when bicarbonate remains bound, has a unique temperature behavior. A series of spectral features associated with the iron-semiquinone in bicarbonate-bound photosystem 2 appear as the temperature is lowered, and the analysis of these data requires that some of these features be assigned to the higher spin states. The results are discussed in terms of the requirement for bicarbonate to be a ligand of the non-heme iron.									19	0	0	0	13	0	19			0006-2960			WOS:A1992HK52400013	1312858

The combination of ultrasound (US) and electrochemical (EC) is a promising technology, because they are efficient, clean and environmentally friendly. In this study, the impacts of anode material have been investigated in US (300 kHz) and EC (10V) system. The results of all systems revealed that the kinetic constant decreased with increasing pH. The results are also shown that Delta G# > 0 and Delta H# > 0 during PCP degradation in EC or US-EC systems are non-spontaneous and endothermic reactions. Meanwhile, in the US-EC system, TiO2, Ti4O7, PbO2, SnSb, RuIr, and BDD, except for TiO2, all the anode materials showed a synergistic index (SI) of 106-197%, and the activation energies were 19.32, 33.4, 33.74, 32.84, 10.41, 36.44 kJ mol-1, respectively. In EC and US-EC systems, PCP can be completely mineralized by BDD anode within 30 min. TBA scavenger experiments verified that hydroxyl radicals were the main oxidant in each system using BDD and PbO2 anode. As a result of estimating the cost according to the anode material when removing PCP using the EC or US-EC system, BDD was the smallest in the two systems, 1.58 and 1.12 $ m- 3, respectively. Finally, this study may serve as a reference for implementation of US-EC system in wastewater treatment.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0045-6535	1879-1298		WOS:000824259200006	35787881

Herein, we have successfully designed and synthesized various cobalt nitrides (Co4N) by using different weak bases (i.e. hexamethylenetetramine (HMT), urea, and ammonium hydroxide (AH)) through nitridation treatment in ammonia (NH3) atmosphere. Physical characterization results demonstrate that Co4N-NSs (nanosheets) with vast meso/macropores and large BET surface are successfully constructed once adding carbon paper and HMT into precursors. As the synergistic effect of metallic character of Co4N phase, excellent electroconductibility of pyrolytic carbon, and large surface area, Co4N-NSs surfaces can form more Co4+ active sites in electrochemical reaction processes. Meanwhile, the abundant meso/macroporous structures constructed in Co4N-NSs further promoted its mass transfer ability. Benefitting from the above mentioned advantages, Co4N-NSs therefore exhibit more excellent glucose oxidation ability than another three control samples (i.e. Co4N-HMT, Co4N-Urea and Co4N-AH). When used for glucose detection, the optimal Co4N-NSs display excellent detection parameters as well, such as: a wide linear range of 0.6-10.0 mM, a large sensitivity of 1137.2 uA cm(-2) mM(-1) glucose, a low detection limit of 0.1 mu M, a small response time of 1.7 s, good reproducibility and stability, and the excellent anti-interference to other electroactive molecules and Cl-.

Traditional anticorrosion methods including sacrificial anodes or protective coatings have performance limitations. Here, we report atomically thin, polycrystalline few-layer graphene (FLG) grown by chemical vapor deposition as a long-term protective coating film for copper Cu). A six-year old, FLG-protected Cu is visually shiny and detailed material characterizations capture no sign of oxidation. The success of the durable anticorrosion film depends on the misalignment of grain boundaries between adjacent graphene layers. Theoretical calculations further found that corrosive molecules always encounter extremely high energy barrier when diffusing through the FLG layers. Therefore, the FLG is able to prevent the corrosive molecules from reaching the underlying Cu surface. This work highlights the interesting structures of polycrystalline FLG and sheds insight into the atomically thin coatings for various applications.									19	1	0	0	0	0	20			1530-6984	1530-6992		WOS:000614066800038	33411539

The synthesized Pt/MWCNT nanocomposite electrocatalyst was characterized using XRD, XRF, FESEM, TEM, and EDX. In the first step, the electrochemical activity and stability of the Pt/MWCNT and Pt/C catalysts were investigated in half cell condition using cyclic voltammetry for 4000 cycles. The Pt/C catalyst showed no activity after 2000 potential cycles, conversely, the Pt/MWCNT catalyst was more active after a potential cycling of 4000 cycles. The cyclic voltammetry results of the first, 1000th, 2000th, 3000th, and 4000th cycle for synthesized Pt/MWCNTs and commercial Pt/C catalysts showed the Pt/MWCNTs was more stable. Then, the membrane electrode assemblies (MEAs) were fabricated for each catalyst. The accelerated durability test (ADT) was done for the MEAs in the high potential operation in the fuel cell test station. The morphology of the fabricated MEAs was determined by FESEM before and after the accelerated degradation test. The polarization test, impedance, and cyclic voltammetry results for MEAs before and after degradation test in fuel cell test station were reported and the results showed the synthesized Pt/MWCNT is more stable catalyst than commercial Pt/C.

The FEGSEM studies found that the change of composition of deposition solution produced a dramatic change in the ZnFe2O4 electrode texture. The ZnFe2O4 electrodes deposited from methanol as well as predominately methanolic solvents had a relatively compact morphology. In contrast, the electrodes deposited from ethanol as well as predominately ethanolic solvents showed highly textured rod-like structure at nanoscale. The change in electrode texture is explained in terms of changes occurred in precursor decomposition pathways from heterogeneous and homogeneous when the composition of deposition solution is systematically varied. The photoelectrochernical (PEG) properties of all ZnFe2O4 electrodes were studied by recording J-V characteristics under AM1.5 illumination and the photocurrent spectra. The textured electrodes exhibited a significantly higher photocurrent compared to their compact counterparts. This is attributed to the improved photogenerated minority carrier collection at the ZnFe2O4/electrolyte interface as the average feature size gradually decreased. The photocurrent density (at 0.25 V vs. Ag/AgCl/3M KCl) increases rapidly when the electrode is deposited from the solvent containing 60% ethanol and above, which is in close agreement with the textural changes taken place in ZnFe2O4 electrodes.

The route of the spread of multiresistant bacteria from human communities to aquatic environment may lead through wastewater treatment plants that release treated wastewater to a water reservoir. In this study we used multiplex PCR assay to determine the frequency of integron presence in Escherichia coli isolates cultured from wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) (integrons were detected in 11% of E. coli isolates), river water upstream (6%) and downstream (14%) the discharge of WWTP, and clinical specimens (56%). Antimicrobial resistance of the integron-positive isolates, determined by disk diffusion method, varied between E. coli of different origin. Isolates from the downstream river, compared to those cultured from upstream river, were more frequently resistant to kanamycin, cephalotin, co-trimoxazole, trimethoprim, and fluoroquinolones. Moreover, they displayed broader resistance ranges, expressed as the number of classes of antimicrobials to which they were resistant. The results may suggest that WWTP effluent contributes to increased frequency of integron-positive E. cali isolates in the river downstream the WWTP and to their elevated resistance level.

J	Vanderbeld, Barbara; Snedden, Wayne A.								Developmental and stimulus-induced expression patterns of Arabidopsis calmodulin-like genes CML37, CML38 and CML39								PLANT MOLECULAR BIOLOGY				64	6			683	697		10.1007/s11103-007-9189-0				AUG 2007	2007	Various aspects of plant development and stress physiology are mediated by Ca2+ signaling. Ca2+ sensors, such as calmodulin, detect these signals and direct downstream signaling pathways by binding and activating diverse targets. Plants possess many unique, putative Ca2+ sensors, including a large family (50 in Arabidopsis) of calmodulin-like proteins termed CMLs. Some of these CMLs have been implicated in Ca2+-based stress response but most remain unstudied. We generated transgenic plants expressing CML::GUS reporter genes for members of a subfamily of CMLs (CML37, CML38 and CML39) which allowed us to investigate their expression patterns in detail. We found that CML::GUS genes displayed unique tissue, cell-type, and temporal patterns of expression throughout normal development, particularly in the flower, and in response to a variety of stimuli, including biotic and abiotic stress, hormone and chemical treatments. Our findings are supported by semiquantitative reverse-transcription PCR as well as analyses of microarray databases. Analysis of purified, recombinant CMLs demonstrated their ability to bind Ca2+ in vitro. Collectively, our data suggest that these CMLs likely play important roles as sensors in Ca2+-mediated developmental and stress response pathways and provide a framework of spatial and temporal expression to direct future studies aimed at elucidating their physiological roles.									98	17	0	0	89	0	116			0167-4412	1573-5028		WOS:000248004200006	17579812

Novel nanocomposites are urgently being explored to develop superior performance TFN RO membranes. Graphene oxide quantum dots (GOQD) is considered to be an ideal nanofiller for improving membrane permeability due to its rich hydrophilic groups, uniform dispersion and small nanosheet shape. As a silver ion (Ag+) compound, silver phosphate (AP) possesses higher bactericidal effect than silver particle in membrane application. Accordingly, we synthesized the multifunctional nanocomposite of AP loaded GOQD by a facile electrostatically driven method. Subsequently, GOQD/AP was embedded into the dense polyamide (PA) layer via interfacial polymerization reaction. The GOQD/AP incorporated TFN membrane possessed a high flux of 39.6L.m(-2).h(-1) at 16 bar, which was 1.5-fold higher than that of the pristine TFC membrane. Meanwhile, the salt rejection was maintained at 98.4%. Noteworthy, the TFN-GOQD/AP membrane exhibited strong bactericidal property against E. coli with a sterilization rate of 99.9% and good stability as well as excellent antifouling performance during RO process. This work provides a feasible strategy to prepare high permselective and anti-bacterial TFN RO membranes for desalination and wastewater reclamation.									40	3	0	0	9	0	43			0011-9164	1873-4464		WOS:000469905400010

Although Ni-based materials have drawn extensive attention as highly active catalysts, the relatively limited electroactive sites in Ni-based catalysts still remains a great issue. In order to further boost the electrocatalytic performances, heteroatom doping and interface engineering are usually adopted for modification. Here, a new strategy is developed to construct W doped NiO/NiS2 interfaced nanosheets directly on carbon sheet, which is working as efficient and bifunctional electrocatalysts for overall water splitting. W doped NiO nanosheets are directly constructed on the carbon sheet by the hydrothermal and annealing processes. After that, W-NiO was subjected to Ar plasma assisted sulfuration treatment for forming W doped NiO/NiS2 interfaced nanosheets. Based on systematic investigations, we find that W doping can effectively induce the modified electronic structure of Ni to boost the intrinsic activities in NiO/NiS2. Further, forming NiO/NiS2 nanointerfaces can also provide rich electroactive sites and boost the charge transfer rate. Consequently, W doped NiO/NiS2 exhibits the much enhanced performances for overall water splitting. As a bifunctional electrode, W-NiO/NiS2 demonstrates a remarkable activity with a 1.614 V cell voltage at 10 mA cm(-2) for overall water splitting. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc.

J	Rivers, John M.; Yousif, Ruqaiya; Kaczmarek, Stephen E.; Al-Shaikh, Ismail								Cenozoic coastal carbonate deposits of Qatar: Evidence for dolomite preservation bias in highly-arid systems								SEDIMENTOLOGY				68	2			771	787		10.1111/sed.12805		DEC 2020		FEB 2021	2021	In the ancient rock record, early replacement of metastable marine calcium carbonate deposits by dolomite has long been associated with evidence of arid depositional environments. Such associations led to the development of the seepage reflux dolomitization model, whereby magnesium-rich marine waters concentrated by evaporation descend into underlying sediments, replacing primary aragonite and calcite deposits with dolomite through rock-water interaction. In the modern arid coastal systems of Qatar, where marine waters concentrate to halite saturation, both aqueous geochemical measurements and mineralogical investigations show that replacement of calcium carbonate deposits by dolomite is not occurring to any consequential degree. At best dolomite formation is minor and localized. Instead, modern and mid-Holocene coastal deposits retain their original mineralogy, showing little evidence of carbonate precipitation reactions with the notable exception of beachrock formation. Pleistocene coastal deposits are mostly absent in comparison with both Qatar Holocene coastal deposits, and Pleistocene coastal deposits from more humid settings. The lack of onshore Pleistocene-aged carbonate outcrops in Qatar, as well as regionally, is interpreted to reflect coastal sediment denudation during emergence due to: (i) the absence of coastal marine lithification; and (ii) the absence of meteoric cementation and root stabilization in the highly-arid realm. In contrast, marine Palaeogene and Miocene carbonate deposits are preserved in outcrop in Qatar, having suffered marine lithification by dolomite, thus promoting retention of carbonate strata through subsequent lowstands. These older deposits formed during times of ocean acidification, which, based on natural system and laboratory investigations, is interpreted to promote metastable carbonate dissolution and dolomite formation. The highly-arid Holocene and Pleistocene coastal systems of Qatar represent limestone factories, but these deposits are not being retained to the rock record. Based on these observations, the association between the occurrence of dolomite and arid depositional settings may be to some degree a preservation bias.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			0037-0746	1365-3091		WOS:000595831800001

High cost and difficulty in synthesis are considerable factors, however, limiting the development and practical applications of SACs. Thus, seeking for non-noble SACs for substituting the noble ones is not only of vital importance but also a long-standing challenge. Herein, a surface modification strategy by introducing an oppositely charged dopant and inducing the charge transfer between the SAC and the substrate was proposed to improve the stability and catalytic performance of the non-noble Cu SAC. Using first-principles density functional theory (DFT) calculations, it was demonstrated that the introduction of C in the MoS2 monolayer (C:MoS2, experimentally available) can assist in stabilizing Cu and make it more positively charged, which will facilitate the adsorption of the reactants and further enhance the activity for CO oxidation. Strikingly, our results show that CO oxidation over Cu-C:MoS2 is more favorable than over the Pt atom deposited on the pristine MoS2 (Pt-MoS2), exhibiting its potential in noble metal substitution and low-temperature CO oxidation. Additionally, Cu-C:MoS2 was observed to have a response to visible light, which manifests that it may be a promising photocatalyst. The strategy proposed here provides an efficient route to regulate the electronic structures of SACs through charge transfer, which further promotes the reactivity of the non-noble metal SACs. We hope that this strategy can contribute to design more SACs with low cost and high efficiency, which will be beneficial for their practical applications.									9	0	0	0	2	0	9			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000529924800023	32243134

However, the connection between presence or absence of these and other genes for nitrogen transformations with the physiological production of nitric oxide (NO) and nitrous oxide (N2O) has not been tested across AOB isolated from various trophic states, with diverse phylogeny, and with closed genomes. It is therefore unclear if genomic content for nitrogen oxide metabolism is predictive of net N2O production. Instantaneous microrespirometry experiments were utilized to measure NO and N2O emitted by AOB during active oxidation of ammonia (NH3) or hydroxylamine (NH2OH) and through a period of anoxia. This data was used in concert with genomic content and phylogeny to assess whether taxonomic factors were predictive of nitrogen oxide metabolism. Results showed that two oligotrophic AOB strains lacking annotated NOR-encoding genes released large quantities of NO and produced N2O abiologically at the onset of anoxia following NH3-oxidation. Furthermore, high concentrations of N2O were measured during active O-2-dependent NH2OH oxidation by the two oligotrophic AOB in contrast to non-oligotrophic strains that only produced N2O at the onset of anoxia. Therefore, complete nitrifier denitrification did not occur in the two oligotrophic strains, but did occur in meso- and eutrophic strains, even in Nitrosomonas communis Nm2 that lacks an annotated NIR-encoding gene. Regardless of mechanism, all AOB strains produced measureable N2O under tested conditions. This work further confirms that AOB require NOR activity to enzymatically reduce NO to N2O in the nitrifier denitrification pathway, and also that abiotic reactions play an important role in N2O formation, in oligotrophic AOB lacking NOR activity.									58	3	0	0	48	0	61			1664-302X			WOS:000379469000001	27462312	
J	Exss-Sonne, P; Tolle, J; Bader, KP; Pistorius, EK; Michel, KP								The IdiA protein of Synechococcus sp PCC 7942 functions in protecting the acceptor side of Photosystem II under oxidative stress								PHOTOSYNTHESIS RESEARCH				63	2			145	157		10.1023/A:1006322925324				2000	2000	Synechococcus sp. strains PCC 7942 and PCC 6301 contain a 35 kDa protein called IdiA (Iron deficiency induced protein A) that is expressed in elevated amounts under Fe deficiency and to a smaller extent also under Mn deficiency. Absence of this protein was shown to mainly damage Photosystem II. To decide whether IdiA has a function in optimizing and/or protecting preferentially either the donor or acceptor side reaction of Photosystem II, a comparative analysis was performed of Synechococcus sp. PCC 7942 wild-type, the IdiA-free mutant, the previously constructed PsbO-free Synechococcus PCC 7942 mutant and a newly constructed Synechococcus PCC 7942 double mutant lacking both PsbO and IdiA. Measurements of the chlorophyll fluorescence and determinations of Photosystem II activity using a variety of electron acceptors gave evidence that IdiA has its main function in protecting the acceptor side of Photosystem II. Especially, the use of dichlorobenzoquinone, preferentially accepting electrons from Q(A), gave a decreased O-2 evolving activity in the IdiA-free mutant. Investigations of the influence of hydrogen peroxide treatment on cells revealed that this treatment caused a significantly higher damage of Photosystem II in the IdiA-free mutant than in wild-type. These results suggest that although the IdiA protein is not absolutely required for Photosystem II activity in Synechococcus PCC 7942, it does play an important role in protecting the acceptor side against oxidative damage.									28	1	0	0	25	0	29			0166-8595	1573-5079		WOS:000087601900004	16228425	
J	Villegas-Pangga, G; Blair, G; Lefroy, R				Burr, Mark/L-2722-2015				Measurement of decomposition and associated nutrient release from straw (Oryza sativa L.) of different rice varieties using a perfusion system								PLANT AND SOIL				223	1-2			1	11		10.1023/A:1004777911428				2000	2000	Maintenance of soil carbon concentrations and synchronisation of nutrient release from crop residues to match crop demand is important if soil organic matter levels are to be maintained and nutrients are to be recycled efficiently. Two laboratory perfusion experiments were conducted to study the decomposition and nutrient release rates from straw of different rice varieties (Oryza sativa L.) which were collected from the field. Cumulative evolution of CO2 and nutrient release from the straw of 20 rice varieties was measured over a 6-week period. The CO2 release rate differed between varieties with the peak of CO2 release varying from 2 to 4 days. After 42 days, the percentage of C released from the straw ranged from 15.4% in variety PSBRc18 to 38.4% in variety Soc Nau. There was an inverse relationship (r(2)=0.60) between cumulative C release and C:N ratio and a direct relationship (r(2)=0.62) between digestible organic matter (DOM) and cumulative C release. A Straw Quality Index (SQI) was developed to describe the decomposition rate of the rice straw as follows:SQI = -56.85+(11.68 x % N) + (1.25 x % DOM) +(2.59 x % lignin) r(2) = 0.81These findings indicate that SQI has a potential in assessing the quality of straw residue materials in predicting their usefulness in crop-residue management systems. Varieties, Soc Nau, IR67962 and PSBRc18, were used in a second perfusion experiment to determine C and nutrient release at 5, 10 and 20 days under aerobic and anaerobic conditions. Despite a two-fold difference between varieties in the amount of C evolved over 20 days, the proportion of nutrient release did not differ significantly between them. When perfusion was performed under anaerobic conditions, there were 45, 32 and 27% reductions in C evolution compared to aerobic conditions from Soc Nau, IR67962 and PSBRc18, respectively, but no differences in the proportion of N, P, S, K Mg and Na released between the aeration systems. These results indicate that under flooded conditions, depletion of O-2 decreases decomposition rate of straw but the initial rate of nutrient release is unaffected. This uncoupling of C and nutrient release appears to be related to the more labile components of the nutrients present in the plants and their physiological role.									39	4	0	0	29	1	44			0032-079X	1573-5036		WOS:000089137900001

This study established the hydrochemistry and stable isotope (delta O-18 and delta D) variations of lake water and groundwater in a typical basin located in the central Qinghai-Tibet Plateau (QTP) of China. The results showed that most water samples could be classified as slightly alkaline, with high levels of salinity and hardness, while the dominant water types were HCO3-CO(3)and Cl types. Natural hydrochemical processes, such as mineral dissolution, cation exchange, and groundwater evaporation, had strong impacts on the groundwater chemistry in this region. Dissolution of halite and carbonate minerals causes the major reactions controlling water chemistry in this basin. Additionally, the calculation of the saturation index (SI) values suggested that aragonite, calcite, and dolomite are saturated, while halite is not. Based on the analysis of the stable isotope characteristics, atmospheric precipitation, groundwater, and meltwater from the permafrost are the major sources of thermokarst lakes. Moreover, the evaporation-to-inflow ratio (E/I) indicated that all of the lakes continuously expanded and rapidly developed. Overall, groundwater is an crucial source of lake recharge and its hydrochemical characteristics also have a certain impact on lake water quality.									4	1	0	0	2	0	5				2073-4441		WOS:000564816000001

In this study, we proposed an efficient Sb-N donor-acceptor pair doping strategy to enhance the H-2 production of anatase TiO2. The as-obtained Sb and N-co-doped TiO2 showed the high solar-light water splitting rate of ca. 2330 mu mol h(-1) g(-1). In contrast, the photocatalytic hydrogen generation of the single N or Sb-doped TiO2 was significantly lower (ca. 191.7 or 470 mu mol h(-1) g(-)1), respectively, directly proving the enhanced synergistic effect of Sb and N in anatase TiO2. During the hydrothermal treatment of massive TiO2, Sb could substitute the Ti atoms in anatase TiO2. Similarly, the N atoms can be occupied by O. The co-doped Sb/N atoms acted as a donor-acceptor pair and regulated the band gap of anatase TiO2 from 3.11 to 2.98 eV, significantly limiting the recombination rate of charge carriers. Furthermore, the photoelectric features of this catalytic system were thoroughly investigated via various characterization methods (e.g., UV-vis spectroscopy, EPR, PL, EIS) to clarify the excellent photoredox water-splitting enhancement of the Sb-N donor-acceptor pairs in anatase TiO2. Moreover, in addition to Sb, Cr and Mo can construct donor-acceptor pairs with N in TiO2; this implies the extensive applicability of the donor-acceptor pair doping strategy in TiO2-based photoredox water splitting.									4	0	0	0	1	0	4			2052-1553			WOS:000491293500020

During the growth procedure, the nucleation process helps us to obtain ZnO nanowires with Au on the tip, confirming the VLS growth mechanism. Different morphologies were obtained after the variation in the growth parameters in the VLS process, and further, their role in the photocatalytic performance was studied. Changes in the structural properties of nanowires allowed us to modify the aspect ratio and surface area of the nanostructures. X-ray diffraction (XRD) showed that the principal orientation of the nanowires was (002) in the present case. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) showed the structural properties of 1-D nanostructures (nanowires), and statistical analysis revealed that the average diameter in the present case was found to be varied from 57 to 85 nm. Scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) technique revealed the different elements present on the surface of ZnO NWs. Further, the compositional profile of nanostructures was cross-verified using Energy dispersive Spectroscopy (EDS). Photoluminescence (PL) and UV Visible studies were employed to study the optical properties of nanowires. UV-Vis measurements showed the role of different structural properties of nanowires on the absorption spectra, especially in the visible region. The ZnO nanowires were tested as photocatalysts for hydrogen production from water splitting reaction, and it was found in particular nanowires with random orientation with optimal diameter distribution show the stable and highest photocatalytic performance.

Besides sustainability, the one-pot procedure represents a scalable synthesis of tailored carbon-metal oxide spheres with a structurally-ordered carbon matrix obtained at a relatively low temperature (700 degrees C). The ability of zinc cations to develop different linkages with starch's hydrophilic functional groups and to act as external nucleators determines an increase in HTC yield; the effect is obvious even in the presence of small concentrations of zinc in the reaction medium (0.005 M), thus providing a way to improve the carbonization process efficiency. It is also shown that zinc content is the control vector of the spherical composite's properties: a variation from 0.3 to 4.8 at% not only induces a variation in their size (200 nm-10 mu m), interconnectivity (from disperse spheres to necklace-like aggregations), surface area and connected porosity (from micro- to mesoporosity), but also of their electrochemical and white light adsorption and emission features. Since the variation in zinc content is made by a simple adjustment of the raw material concentrations, the functionality of these carbon-based materials can be modulated in a straightforward manner.									16	0	0	0	2	0	16			1463-9076	1463-9084		WOS:000388492900061	27801475	
J	Allan, Euan R. O.; Blouin, Michael S.								Allelic variation partially regulates galactose-dependent hydrogen peroxide release from circulating hemocytes of the snail Biomphalaria glabrata								FISH & SHELLFISH IMMUNOLOGY				72				111	116		10.1016/j.fsi.2017.10.037				JAN 2018	2018	Freshwater snails are the intermediate hosts for numerous parasitic worms that are detrimental to human and agricultural health. Understanding the immune responses of these snails could be vital for finding ways to block transmission of those parasites. Allelic variation in a recently discovered genomic region in the snail, Biomphalaria glabrata, influences their susceptibility to schistosomes. Here we tested whether genes in that region, termed the Guadeloupe Resistance Complex (GRC), are involved in recognition of common pathogen associated molecules that have been shown to be stimulants of the hydrogen peroxide defense pathway. We show that hemocytes extracted from individuals with one of the three GRC genotypes released less hydrogen peroxide than the other two genotypes, after stimulation with galactose. This difference was not observed after stimulation with several other microbial-associated carbohydrates, despite those ligands sharing the same putative pathway for hydrogen peroxide release. Therefore, we conclude that allelic variation in the GRC region may influence the recognition of galactose, rather than the conserved downstream steps in the hydrogen peroxide pathway. These results thus are consistent with the hypothesis that proteins produced by this region are involved in pathogen recognition.									10	0	0	0	10	0	10			1050-4648	1095-9947		WOS:000423644600014	29107743

The delta O-18 values of the garnet and clinopyroxene in the prograde skarn are indicative of delta O-18(fluid) compositions near 9.5-10.9 parts per thousand. The compositions of clinoamphibole and biotite of the retrograde skarn suggest equivalent delta O-18(fluid) values (9.1-12.0 parts per thousand). These heavy delta O-18 values indicate that the mineralizing fluids equilibrated with deep crustal rocks, with no significant input of surficial waters, even during the formation of the retrograde skarn. The Sr and Nd radiogenic isotope data for the scheelite (Sr-87/Sr-86 in the range 0.7117-0.7119: epsilon Nd-300Ma, between -9.4 and -8.5), garnet-pyroxene skarn (Sr-87/Sr-86 in the range 0.7119-0.7128; epsilon Nd-300Ma between -8.5 and -8.7) and plagioclase-rich skarn (Sr-87/Sr-86 in the range 0.7124-0.7129; epsilon Nd-300Ma between -9.7 and -7.0) trace the complex evolution of hydrothermal fluids circulating through deep perigranitic systems. These signatures, as well as the REE contents, suggest equilibration of an external fluid with the host metasedimentary sequence. The regional geology and the Nd isotopes indicate that the ultimate source of the hydrothermal fluids and the tungsten and fluorine is not the adjacent barren granodiorite-tonalite nor the host metamorphic rocks, but rather an unexposed granitic pluton geochemically equivalent to the (biotite +/- tourmaline)-bearing, fine-grained leucogranite dikes that crop out nearby. These are characterized by high Sr-87 values (Sr-87/Sr-86 > 0.7112-0.7149) and intermediate epsilon Nd signatures (epsilon Nd-300Ma in the range -5.6 to -4.6) and are similar to those hosting perigranitic W-(Sn) mineralization in other areas of the Variscan Belt. Thus, the geochemical data show that the magmatic fluids extensively interacted with the host aluminosilicate rocks but were not able to precipitate the scheelite and fluorite until the reaction with carbonate rocks. Scheelite from nearby regionally stratabound orebodies have isotopic signatures (Sr-87/Sr-86 in the range 0.7108-0.7110; epsilon Nd-300Ma = -8.6) similar to those of the Los Santos skarn, strongly Suggesting that they are also of Variscan perigranitic origin and not exhalative or synmetamorphic, as had been previously proposed.									11	5	0	0	0	0	15			0008-4476			WOS:000255017100006		
J	Tame, Akihiro; Ozawa, Genki; Maruyama, Tadashi; Yoshida, Takao								Morphological and functional characterization of hemocytes from two deep-sea vesicomyid clams Phreagena okutanii and Abyssogena phaseoliformis								FISH & SHELLFISH IMMUNOLOGY				74				281	294		10.1016/j.fsi.2017.12.058				MAR 2018	2018	Deep-sea vesicomyid clams harboring intracellular symbiotic sulfur-oxidizing bacteria are often dominant in chemosynthetic animal communities. Although they are known to have erythrocytes, little is known about other hemocytes. To investigate the types and roles of various hemocytes in vesicomyid clams, we performed morphological, histochemical and functional characterization of the hemocytes in two species, Phreagena okutanii, collected from 873 to 978 m depth, and Abyssogena phaseoliformis, from 5199 to 5355 m. Both were found to have three types of hemocytes: erythrocytes (ERCs), eosinophilic granulocytes (EGs), and basophilic granulocytes (BGs). The ERCs contain hemoglobin in the cytoplasm, with basophilic vacuoles containing acid polysaccharide, neutral lipids, and peroxidase. The EGs were found to contain acid polysaccharides and eosinophilic granules containing lysosomal enzymes, acid and alkaline phosphatases, chloroacetate esterase, and peroxidase. Although BGs had some basophilic granules with alkaline phosphatase, they lacked acid phosphatase and acid polysaccharides. The EGs and BGs were shown to have phagocytic ability, while the ERCs exhibited no phagocytosis. The EGs showed higher phagocytic activity as well as a higher phagosome-lysosome fusion rate than BGs. The hemocytes of the two vesicomyid species differed in the intracellular structures. In A. phaseoliformis, ERCs additionally contained neutral polysaccharides in vacuoles and had vesicles with acinus-like acidic mucus in the cytoplasm, neither of which were observed in P. okutanii. The eosinophilic granules in the EGs had heteromorphically-elongated shapes containing homogeneously electron-dense material in P. okutanii, but were more spherical and composed of fibrous structures in A. phaseoliformis. The difference in hemocytes between the two clams seems to be reflective of phylogenetically differentiated lineages adapting to differing conditions in their respective deep-sea environments, such as dissolved oxygen, hydrogen sulfide concentration, and hydrostatic pressure. In the view of phylogeny of veneroida clams including two vesicomyids, their hemocytes appear to be categorizable into three basic types, with the first containing ERCs and agranulocytes, the second including EGs, and the third comprised of BGs, small eosinophilic granulocytes, and other granulocytes. The present data showed no phagocytic activity of ERCs and a lack of agranulocytes in both vesicomyid species, and when combined with previous reports that other veneroid clams show low or no phagocytic activity, this suggests that ERCs have become evolutionarily differentiated from agranulocytes in the ancestral vesicomyid clam.									4	0	0	0	2	0	4			1050-4648	1095-9947		WOS:000427344200030	29305332

Heteroatomic doping can effectively regulate the band structure of graphene. Besides, the doping of phosphorus increases the distance between the metal alloy cores and is accompanied by the contraction of the D bandgap, the Fermi level near the density-of-states (DOS) is enhanced, which makes it have the characteristics of precious metals. Therefore, the design of heteroatomic-doped graphene-coated phosphorus-doped metal core-shell structure will effectively improve the electrocatalytic performance. Here, we use Prussian blue as the precursor to prepare the transition metal binary alloy and ternary alloy coated with multi-layer nitrogen-rich graphene shell by direct annealing in an inert atmosphere. Further, the core-shell nanostructure was converted to phosphorus-doped FeCoMo ternary alloy core through phosphating, in which phosphorus plays the role of bridging the ternary alloy and N-doped graphene shell, which is beneficial to improve the HER performance. The optimal material FeCoMo@NG-P exhibited excellent catalytic performance for HER in both 1.0 M KOH and 0.5 M H2SO4, reaching a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at low overpotentials of 170 mV for the alkaline solution and 196 mV for the acid solution, and the corresponding Tafel slopes are 95.37 and 63.17 mV dec(-1), respectively. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations indicate that changing the ratio of the internal alloy can regulate the charge distribution on the surface of the outer graphene layer. In addition, in the case of phosphorus-bridged ternary metal alloy core and nitrogen-doped graphene shell, they synergistically increase the electron density and regulate the energy band structure on the surface of the graphene layer, which results in superior HER activity.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000762398600001

Glutathione S-transferases (GSTs EC 2.5.1.18) are multifunctional enzymes which play a crucial role in cellular detoxification and oxidative stress tolerance. In this study, 84 GST genes were identified in barley by a comprehensive in silico approach. Sequence alignment and phylogenetic analysis grouped these HvGST proteins in eight classes. The largest numbers of the HvGST genes (50) were included in the Tau class followed by 21 genes in Phi, five in Zeta, two in DHAR, two in EF1G, two in Lambda, and one each in TCHQD and Theta classes. Phylogenetic analysis of the putative GSTs from Arabidopsis, rice, and barley indicated that major functional diversification within the GST family predated the monocot/dicot divergence. However, intra-specious duplication seems to be common. Expression patterns of five GST genes from Phi and Tau classes were investigated in three barley genotypes (Yusof [drought-tolerant], Moroc9-75 [drought-sensitive], and HS1 [wild ecotype]) under control and drought-stressed conditions, during the vegetative stage. All investigated genes were up-regulated significantly under drought stress and/or showed a higher level of transcripts in the tolerant cultivar. Additionally, GST enzyme activity was superior in Yusof and induced in the extreme-drought-treated leaves, while it was not changed in Moroc9-75 under drought conditions. Moreover, the lowest and highest levels of lipid peroxidation were observed in the Yusof and Moroc9-75 cultivars, respectively. Based on the achieved results, detoxification and antioxidant activity of GSTs might be considered an important factor in the drought tolerance of barley genotypes for further investigations.

There is no response to antibiotics. BOOP is essentially idiopathic, but associations to other conditions exist. Lung function is often restrictive; biochemistry is not pathognomonic. BAL shows a mixed cellular pattern. The gold standard for pathologic diagnosis is open or thoracoscopic lung biopsy. However, a BOOP pat tern or reaction is often seen on histologic specimens without the clinical-radiologic features of the BOOP-entity. Therapy consists;of corticosteroids, which have to be prescribed for a long time at a rather high dose. Recurrence is frequent, but prognosis is good. Evolution to respiratory insufficiency and death is rare and may occur in rapidly progressive BOOP.This study reports on 11 cases (6 males/5 females) of clinical-pathological BOOP-syndrome (mean age 58 yrs, range 17-73 yrs), with an unexpectedly high mortality rate of 36% (4 cases). The disease was idiopathic in 7, and was associated with intake of amiodarone (in 1), with past Mycoplasma pneumonia (in 1) and with connective tissue disease (in 2). There was a history of a flu-like syndrome, cough and dyspnea of a mean duration of 4 months (range 1 week to 8 months). Lung function was mostly restrictive or/and obstructive with a diffusing capacity ranging between 47 and 95% predicted; there was hypoxia in about half of the patients. Chest X-ray and computed tomography (CT) scan showed a patchy consolidation with linear opacities (unilateral in 4 patients, bilateral in 5) and/or a ground glass pattern (in 4 patients), and a focal pseudo-tumoral lesion (in 1). Bronchoalveolar lavage showed a variable pattern of mixed, or eosinophilic or neutrophilic alveolitis. Histologic diagnosis was based on open lung biopsy (in 3), on thoracoscopic biopsy (in 2), on transbronchial biopsy (in 2), on wedge resection of the nodular lesion (in 1) and on postmortem lung biopsy (in 3). One patient recovered spontaneously, 1 remained cured after resection of the focal lesion, 7 were treated with 16-125 mg methylprednisolone (of whom 3 had a temporary flare-up during tapering the corticosteroids and 2 died after 1 and 3 months due to infectious complications), 2 died due to rapidly progressive BOOP.									14	1	0	0	4	0	15			1784-3286	2295-3337		WOS:000077316800007	9861759

Being green and clean, it is considered to play an important role in energy and environmental issues. Photocatalytic water splitting is a process used to generate hydrogen from the dissociation of water. Titanium dioxide is the archetype material for photocatalytic water splitting. However, because of the fast recombination of the photo-generated exciton, the yield of the reaction is typically low. To overcome this limit, in this work, the surface of the TiO2 nanoparticles was modified with copper and graphene to give hybrid nanostructures. Synthesized materials were tested in the photocatalytic hydrogen generation using methanol as the sacrificial agent. X-ray diffraction and spectroscopic results showed that copper did not enter the TiO2 structure, and that neither copper nor graphene substantially altered the optical band-gap of prepared photocatalysts. Detailed aberration-corrected high-resolution electron transmission electron imaging and spatially resolved energy-loss spectroscopy experiments showed the oxidation and amorphization of graphene nanoplatelets, probably due to the combined action of the acidic media of the solution with the thermal treatment necessary to produce the hybrid materials. Hydrogen generation from methanol/water mix proved that exists an optimum concentration of both copper and graphene (i.e. 0.5 mol% copper plus 0.5 wt% graphene) to grant a two-fold increase in hydrogen production compared with that of unmodified titania when using UVA irradiation. A higher amount of initial graphene (i.e. 1.0 wt% graphene and 0.5 mol% copper) was instead necessary for granting higher H-2 generation on visible-light exposure. Hybrid materials based on titania modified with both copper oxide and carbon-based materials could therefore be exploited as ideal candidates for light-to-energy applications. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

The nanocrystalline, composition, morphology and structure of the hybrid nano-sheets are confirmed with phenetic analysis of XRD, EDS, XPS, TEM and SEM. The as-synthesized of CoxNi(1-x)/C NSs were obtained under varied temperature and ratio of Ni and Co, and the ultra-thin carbon species with thickness of 10-30 nm were fabricated from a novel and economical carbon source (potassium fulvic acid, P-FA). The Co0.5Ni0.5/C-600 NSs that was obtained from calcination temperature 600 degrees C and molar ratio of Co:Ni = 1:1 showed the best catalytic activity though the reduction of 4-nitrophenol (4-NP) as a common benchmark reaction. Furthermore, the homologous apparent rate constant k(app) of the Co0.5Ni0.5/C-600 nanocatalyst is 1.3949 min(-1) for reduction of 4-NP in presence of NaBH4, and all rate constant for CoxNi(1-x)/C NSs were calculated with Pseudo-first rate equation. The excellent catalytic activity of the nanocatalyst was attributed to the larger specific surface area with 202.8 m(2)/g, excellent electrical conductivity of carbon material and synergistic effect of cobalt and nickel bimetal. We believe that our method can provide useful assistance for the synthesis of humic acid-based materials, and those may be applied to other domains.									5	0	0	0	1	0	5			2213-2929	2213-3437		WOS:000444046700154

At the same time, the interaction of the catalyst surface with even a relatively simple gas-phase environment such as syngas (CO and H-2) may already produce a wide variety of reaction intermediates ranging from atoms to complex molecules. The starting point for creating predictive maps of, e.g., surface coverages or chemical activities of potential catalyst materials is the reliable prediction of adsorption enthalpies of all of these intermediates. For simple systems, direct density functional theory (DFT) calculations are currently the method of choice. However, a wider exploration of complex materials and reaction networks generally requires enthalpy predictions at lower computational cost.The use of machine learning (ML) and related techniques to make accurate and low-cost predictions of quantum-mechanical calculations has gained increasing attention lately. The employed approaches span from physically motivated models over hybrid physics-Delta ML approaches to complete black-box methods such as deep neural networks. In recent works we have explored the possibilities for using a compressed sensing method (Sure Independence Screening and Sparsifying Operator, SISSO) to identify sparse (low-dimensional) descriptors for the prediction of adsorption enthalpies at various active-site motifs of metals and oxides. We start from a set of physically motivated primary features such as atomic acid/base properties, coordination numbers, or band moments and let the data and the compressed sensing method find the best algebraic combination of these features. Here we take this work as a starting point to categorize and compare recent ML-based approaches with a particular focus on model sparsity, data efficiency, and the level of physical insight that one can obtain from the model.Looking ahead, while many works to date have focused only on the mere prediction of databases of, e.g., adsorption enthalpies, there is also an emerging interest in our field to start using ML predictions to answer fundamental science questions about the functioning of heterogeneous catalysts or perhaps even to design better catalysts than we know today. This task is significantly simplified in works that make use of scaling-relation-based models (volcano curves), where the model outcome is determined by only one or two adsorption enthalpies and which consequently become the sole target for ML-based high-throughput screening or design. However, the availability of cheap ML energetics also allows going beyond scaling relations. On the basis of our own work in this direction, we will discuss the additional physical insight that can be achieved by integrating ML-based predictions with traditional catalysis modeling techniques from thermal and electrocatalysis, such as the computational hydrogen electrode and microkinetic modeling, as well as the challenges that lie ahead.									18	0	0	0	0	0	18			0001-4842	1520-4898		WOS:000663934000003	34080415

Evolutionary biologists have proposed different theories to explain how longevity variability may be driven by bad genes expression in late life or by gene pleiotropic effects. This reflexion has stimulated, in the last ten years, an active research on the proximal mechanisms that can shape lifespan. Reactive oxygen species (ROS), i.e., the by-products of oxidative metabolism, have emerged as the main proximate cause of ageing. Because ROS are mainly produced by the mitochondria, their production is linked to metabolic rate, and this may explain the differences in longevity between large and small species. However, their implication in the sex difference in longevity within a species has never been tested, despite the fact that these differences are widespread in the animal kingdom.Methodology/Principal Findings: Mitochondrial superoxide production of hemolymph immune cells and antioxidant and oxidative damages plasma levels were measured in adult male and female B. albopilosa at different ages. We found that female spiders are producing less mitochondrial superoxide, are better protected against oxidative attack and are then suffering less oxidative damages than males at adulthood.Conclusions/Significance: In tarantulas, once reaching sexual maturity, males have a life expectancy reduced to 1 to 2 years, while females can still live for 20 years, in spite of the fact that females continue to grow and moult. This study evidences an increased exposure of males to oxidative stress due to an increase in mitochondrial superoxide production and a decrease in hemolymph antioxidant defences. Such a phenomenon is likely to be part of the explanation for the sharp reduction of longevity accompanying male tarantula maturity. This opens several fundamental research roads in the future to better understand how reproduction and longevity are linked in an original ageing model.									27	0	0	0	25	1	27			1932-6203			WOS:000282359300010	20957044

PCC 6803 carrying short deletions within the large, lumen-exposed hydrophilic region (loop E) of the chlorophyll a-binding photosystem II protein CP47. A physiological and biochemical characterization of these mutant strains has been presented previously [Eaton-Rye, J. J., and Vermaas, W. F. J. (1991) Plant Mel. Biol. 17, 1165-1177; Haag, E., Eaten-Rye, J. J., Renger, G., and Vermaas, W. F. J. (1993) Biochemistry 32, 4444-4454], and some functional properties were described recently [Gleiter, H. M., Haag, E., Shen, J.-R., Eaten-Rye, J. J., Inoue, Y., Vermaas, W. F. J., and Renger, G. (1994) Biochemistry 33, 12063-12071]. The present study shows that in several mutants the water-oxidizing complex (WOC) became inactivated during prolonged dark incubation, whereas the WOC of the wild-type strain remained active. The rate and extent of the inactivation in the mutants depend on the domain of loop E, where 3-8 amino acid residues were deleted. The most pronounced effects are observed in mutants Delta(A373-D380) and Delta(R384-V392). A competent WOC can be restored from the fully inactivated state by illumination with short saturating flashes. The number of flashes required for this process strongly depends on the site at which a deletion has been introduced into loop E. Again, the most prominent effects were found in mutants Delta(A373-D380) and Delta(R384-V392). Interestingly, the number of flashes required for activation was reduced by more than an order of magnitude in both mutants by the addition of 10 mM CaCl2 to the cell suspension. On the basis of a model for photoactivation proposed by Tamura and Cheniae (1987) [Biochim. Biophys. Acta 890, 179-193], a scheme is presented for the processes of dark; inactivation and photoactivation in these mutants. The results presented here corroborate an important role of the large hydrophilic domain (loop E) of CP47 in a functional and stable WOC.									49	1	0	0	40	0	49			0006-2960			WOS:A1995QZ90200031	7756315

Scanning electron microscopy images showed many aggregated COFs crystals anchored on the irregular g-C3N4 surface to form 3D structures. The precursors (urea, melamine, and dicyandiamide) of g-C3N4 determined the porous structures and properties of the g-C3N4@COF materials. The hybrids possessed superior reactivity in Orange II removal (100%) compared to pristine g-C3N4 (10%) and COF (5%), benefiting from high-temperature pyrolysis to generate crystal carbon and modulate nitrogen doping. Besides, removal efficiency of target pollutants depended on the oxidant dosages (0.33-1.30 mM), initial concentrations of organics (10-40 mg/L), temperatures (5-45 degrees C), pHs (1.72-10.3), and anions (Cl-, SO42-, NO3-, HCO3-, CO32-, and HCOO-). Quenching experiments and electron paramagnetic resonance demonstrated that non-radical singlet oxygen (O-1(2)) was the dominant species for the oxidation of organic pollutants via electron transfer in the g-C3N4@COF/PMS system. It was inferred that the good balance between graphitization degree and nitrogen content benefited to enhancing the catalytic performance for the refractory pollutant degradation. The present investigation provides a new avenue for the design and construction of metal-free hybrid composites for environmental remediation. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc.

J	Hine, P. M.								Haplosporidian host:parasite interactions								FISH & SHELLFISH IMMUNOLOGY				103				190	199		10.1016/j.fsi.2020.05.004				AUG 2020	2020	The host:parasite interactions of the 3 serious haplosporidian pathogens of oysters, on which most information exists, are reviewed. They are Bonamia ostreae in Ostrea spp. and Crassostrea gigas; Bonamia exitiosa in Ostrea spp.; and Haplosporidium nelsoni in Crassostrea spp. Understanding the haemocytic response to pathogens is constrained by lack of information on haematopoiesis, haemocyte identity and development. Basal haplospridians in spot prawns are probably facultative parasites. H. nelsoni and a species infecting Haliotis iris in New Zealand (NZAP), which have large extracellular plasmodia that eject haplosporosomes or their contents, lyse surrounding cells and are essentially extracellular parasites. Bonamia spp. have small plasmodia that are phagocytosed, haplosporosomes are not ejected and they are intracellular obligate parasites.Phagocytosis by haemocytes is followed by formation of a parasitophorous vacuole, blocking of haemocyte lysosomal enzymes and the endolysosomal pathway. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are blocked by antioxidants, and host cell apoptosis may occur. Unlike susceptible O. edulis, the destruction of B. ostreae by C. gigas may be due to higher haemolymph proteins, higher rates of granulocyte binding and phagocytosis, production of ROS, the presence of plasma beta-glucosidase, antimicrobial peptides and higher levels of haemolymph and haemocyte enzymes. In B.exitiosa infection of Ostrea chilensis, cytoplasmic lipid bodies (LBs) containing lysosomal enzymes accumulate in host granulocytes and in B. exitiosa following phagocytosis. Their genesis and role in innate immunity and inflammation appears to be the same as in vertebrate granulocytes and macrophages, and other invertebrates. If so, they are probably the site of eicosanoid synthesis from arachidonic acid, and elevated numbers of LBs are probably indicative of haemocyte activation. It is probable that the molecular interaction, and role of LBs in the synthesis and storage of eicosanoids from arachidonic acid, is conserved in innate immunity in vertebrates and invertebrates. However, it seems likely that haplosporidians are more diverse than realized, and that there are many variations in host parasite interactions and life cycles.									2	0	0	0	2	0	2			1050-4648	1095-9947		WOS:000540375500022	32437861

Moso bamboo (Phyllostachys edulis), is a renewable and versatile resource with significant ecological and economic value, which encounters high light stress with large amplitude in natural environment. However, the gene expression profiles in response to high light were elusive in bamboo.Results: We firstly performed physiological experiments on moso bamboo leaves treated with high light (1200 mu mol.m(-2).s(-1)). Based on the physiological results, three samples of leaves treated with high light for 0 h (CK), 0.5 h (0.5H), and 8 h (8H) were selected to perform further high-throughput RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq), respectively. Then, the transcriptomic result demonstrated that the most genes were expressed at a statistically significant value (FPKM >= 1) and the RNA-Seq data were validated via quantitative real time PCR. Moreover, some significant gene expression changes were detected. For instance, 154 differentially expressed genes were detected in 0.5H vs. CK, those in 8H vs. CK were 710, and 429 differentially expressed genes were also identified in 0.5H vs. 8 H. Besides, 47 gene annotations closely related to photosynthesis were refined, including 35 genes annotated as light-harvesting chlorophyll a/b-binding (LHC) proteins, 9 LHC-like proteins and 3 PsbSs. Furthermore, the pathway of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in photosynthesis was further analyzed. A total of 171 genes associated with ROS-scavenging were identified. Some up-regulated transcript factors, such as NAC, WRKY, AR2/ERF, and bHLH, mainly concentrated in short-term response, while C2H2, HSF, bZIP, and MYB were largely involved in short and middle terms response to high light.Conclusion: Based on the gene expression analysis of moso bamboo in response to high light, we thus identified the global gene expression patterns, refined the annotations of LHC protein, LHC-like protein and PsbS, detected the pathway of ROS as well as identified ROS-scavenging genes and transcription factors in the regulation of photosynthetic and related metabolisms. These findings maybe provide a starting point to interpret the molecular mechanism of photosynthesis in moso bamboo under high light stress.									23	6	0	0	19	0	29			1471-2229			WOS:000368881600004	26822690

Increasing soluble sugar and scavenging reactive oxygen species (ROS) play critical roles in grapevine resistance to cold stress. However, the mechanism of beta -amylase (BAM) involved in the regulation of sugar levels and antioxidant enzyme activities in response to cold stress is unclear.ResultsIn this study, six BAM genes were identified and clustered into four groups. Multiple sequence alignment and gene structure analysis showed that VvBAM6 lacked the Glu380 residue and contained only an exon. The transcript abundance of VvBAM1 and VvBAM3 significantly increased as temperature decreased. After LT stress, VvBAM1 was highly expressed in the leaves, petioles, stems, and roots of overexpressing tomato lines. The total amylase and BAM activities increased by 6.5- and 6.01-fold in transgenic plants compared with those in wild-type tomato plants (WT) subjected to LT, respectively. The glucose and sucrose contents in transgenic plants were significantly higher than those in WT plants, whereas the starch contents in the former decreased by 1.5-fold compared with those in the latter under LT stress. The analysis of transcriptome sequencing data revealed that 541 genes were upregulated, and 663 genes were downregulated in transgenic plants. One sugar transporter protein gene (SlSTP10), two peroxidase (POD)-related genes (SlPER7 and SlPER5), and one catalase (CAT)-related gene (SlCAT1) were upregulated by 8.6-, 3.6-, 3.0-, and 2.3-fold in transgenic plants after LT stress, respectively.ConclusionsOur results suggest that VvBAM1 overexpression promotes ROS scavenging and improves cold tolerance ability by modulating starch hydrolysis to affect soluble sugar levels in tomato plants.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1471-2229			WOS:000635188200003	33771117

Photoanodes for water oxidation play the determining roles in solar water splitting, while its photoelectrochemical (PEC) performance is severely limited by the hole injection efficiency at the interface of semiconductor/electrolyte. To address this problem, in this research, by employing BiVO4 as the model semiconductor for photoanodes, we develop a novel, facile, and efficient method, which simply applies K cations in the preparation process of BiVO4 photoanodes, to in situ induce a crystalline-amorphous heterophase junction by the formation of an amorphous BiVO4 layer (a-BiVO4) on the surface of the crystalline BiVO4 (c-BiVO4) film for PEC water oxidation. The K cation is the key to stimulate the formation of the heterophase, but not incorporated in the final photoelectrodes. Without sacrificing the light absorption, the in situ formed a-BiVO4 layer accelerates the kinetics of the hole tranfer at the photoanode/electrolyte interface, leading to the significantly increased efficiency of the surface hole injection to water molecules. Consequently, the BiVO4 photoanode with the crystalline-amorphous heterophase junction (a-BiVO4/c-BiVO4) exhibits almost twice the photocurrent density at 1.23 V (vs reversible hydrogen electrode) for water oxidation than the bare c-BiVO4 ones. Such advantages from the crystalline-amorphous heterophase junction are still effective even when the a-BiVO4/c-BiVO4 is coated by the cocatalyst of FeOOH, reflecting its broad applications in PEC devices. We believe this study can supply an efficient and simple protocol to enhance the PEC water oxidation performance of photoanodes, and provide a new strategy for the potential large-scale application of the solar energy-conversion related devices.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000612551400053	33411507

CAT mRNAs have been cloned from many species and employed as useful biomarkers of oxidative stress. In the present study, we cloned the cDNA sequence of CAT gene from freshwater planarian Dugesia japonica (designated as DjCAT) by means of RACE method. Sequence analysis and multiple alignment jointly showed that the full-length cDNA sequence consists of 1734 nucleotides, encoding 506 amino acids. Three catalytic amino acid residues of His71, Asn144 and Tyr354, two CAT family signature sequences of a proximal active site signature ("FDRERIPERVVHAKGGGA77) and a heme-ligand signature motif ((350)RLFSYRDTQ(358)) are highly conserved, suggesting that the DjCAT belongs to the NADPH and heme-binding CAT family and has similar functions. In addition, the transcriptional level of CAT gene and activity of CAT enzyme upon acute exposure of environmental pollutants glyphosate and 1-decyl-3-methylimidazolium bromide ([C(10)mim]Br) were investigated systematically. The variation of CAT mRNA expression in D. japonica was quantified by real-time PCR and the results indicated that it was up-regulated after exposure to glyphosate or [C(10)mim]Br with a dose-dependent manner but not linearly. Even though the variation trend of CAT activity upon glyphosate stress was not monotonously increased and inconsistent with that after [C,0mim] Br exposure on day 1 and 3 sampling time, with the duration prolonged to day 5 they both presented a dose dependent increase and the differences achieved extreme significance in all treated groups compared to the control. These findings suggested that DjCAT plays an important role in antioxidant defense in D. japonica, and the mRNA expression of CAT would also be used as an effective biomarker to monitor the pollution in aquatic environment just like its corresponding enzyme.									16	5	0	0	19	0	21			0147-6513	1090-2414		WOS:000447484000011	30193168

The exploited fluids are of meteoric origin, mixed with deep magmatic fluids, which interacted with the metamorphic rocks of the Menderes Massif. The geothermal fluids are channeled along Quaternary faults belonging to the main normal faults system delimiting the northern side of the Denizli Basin and their associated transfer zones. In this study, hydrochemical and isotopic analyses of the thermal and cold waters allow us to determine water-rock interactions, fluid paths and mixing processes.Two groups of thermal waters have been distinguished: (i) Group 1A, comprising Na-SO4 type and Ca-SO4 type and (ii) Group 1B, only consisting Ca-HCO3 type waters. Differently, two groups were recognized in the cold waters: (i) Group 2A, corresponding to Ca-HCO3 type and (ii) Group 2B, including Mg-HCO3 type. Their geochemical characteristics indicate interactions with the Paleozoic metamorphic rocks of the Menderes Massif and with the Neogene lacustrine sedimentary rocks. Dissolution of host rock and ion-exchange reactions modify thermal water composition in the reservoir of the GGF. High correlation in some ionic ratios and high concentrations of some minor elements suggest an enhanced water-rock interaction. None of the thermal waters has been reached a complete chemical re-equilibrium, possibly as a result of mixing with cold water during their pathways. Geothermal reservoir temperatures are calculated in the range of 130-210 degrees C for the Golemezli field.Very negative delta O-18 and delta H-2 isotopic ratios are respectively between -8.37 and -8.13 parts per thousand and -61.09 and -59.34 parts per thousand for the SO4-rich thermal waters, and ca. -8.40 and -8.32 parts per thousand and -57.80 and -57.41 parts per thousand for the HCO3-rich thermal waters. Low tritium (<1 TU) and low oxygen isotope values reflect a deep circuit and fluids of meteoric origin. Positive delta C-13(DIC) ratios (+ 5.11 to +7.54 parts per thousand) of all thermal waters imply a contribution of metamorphic origin. Heating is guaranteed by a deep circuit within an overheated continental crust, mainly affected by damaged rock volumes. Volatile ascent from deep magmatic sources through crustal structures can explain the occurrence of mantle volatiles at shallow depth in the Denizli Basin. The NW- and NE-trending fault systems, associated with their related fractures, played as hydraulic conduits underlining the strict link existing between fractures and fluid convection in the extensional settings. In this view, the GGF is a very good example of geothermal field associated to active tectonic setting and magmatism, as it is the case of the other geothermal fields occurring in the Denizli Basin.

In this work, reactive impingement mixing is conducted in a two-stage impinging jet microreactor (TS-IJMR) for the controllable and scale-up synthesis of nickel-cobalt boride@borate core-shell nanostructures on RGO flakes (NCBO/RGO). Benefiting from the good process control and improved micromixing efficiency of TS-IJMR, NCBO/RGO nanosheet provides a large BET surface area, abundant of suitable mesopores (2-5 nm), fast ion diffusion, and facile electron transfer within the whole electrode. Therefore, NCBO/RGO electrode exhibits a high specific capacitance of 2383 F g(-1) at 1 A g(-1), and still retains 1650 F g(-1) when the current density is increased to 20 A g(-1), much higher than those of nickel boride@borate/RGO (NBO/RGO) and cobalt boride@borate/RGO (CBO/RGO) synthesized in TS-IJMR, as well as NCBO/RGO-S synthesized in STR. In addition, an asymmetric supercapacitor (NCBO/RGO//AC) is constructed with NCBO/RGO and activated carbon (AC), which displays a high energy density of 53.3 W h kg(-1) and long cyclic lifespan with 91.8% capacitance retention after 5000 charge-discharge cycles. Finally, NCBO/RGO is used as OER electrocatalyst to possess a low overpotential of 309 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) and delivers a good long-term durability for 10 h. This study opens up the potential of controllable and scale-up synthesis of NCBO/RGO nanosheets for high-performance supercapacitor electrode materials and OER catalysts.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2296-2646			WOS:000787580900001	35494639

This study aimed to investigate the occurrence of WSSV in different ghers of Bangladesh and the virulence of the circulating phylotypes. We collected 360 shrimp (Penaeus monodon) and 120 crab (Scylla sp.) samples from the south-east (Cox's Bazar) and south-west (Satkhira) coastal regions of Bangladesh. The VP28 gene-specific PCR assays and sequencing revealed statistically significant (p < 0.05, Kruskal-Wallis test) differences in the prevalence of WSSV in shrimps and crabs between the study areas (Cox's Bazar and Satkhira) and over the study periods (2017-2019). The mean Log load of WSSV varied from 8.40 (Cox's Bazar) to 10.48 (Satkhira) per gram of tissue. The mean values for salinity, dissolved oxygen, temperature and pH were 14.71 +/- 0.76 ppt, 3.7 +/- 0.1 ppm, 34.11 +/- 0.38 degrees C and 8.23 +/- 0.38, respectively, in the WSSV-positive ghers. The VP28 gene-based phylogenetic analysis showed an amino-acid substitution (E -> G) at the 167th position in the isolates from Cox's Bazar (referred to as phylotype BD2) compared to the globally circulating one (BD1). Shrimp PL artificially challenged with BD1 and BD2 phylotypes with filtrates of tissue containing 0.423 x 10(9) copies of WSSV per mL resulted in a median LT50 value of 73 h and 75 h, respectively. The in vivo trial showed higher mean Log WSSV copies (6.47 +/- 2.07 per mg tissue) in BD1-challenged shrimp PL compared to BD2 (4.75 +/- 0.35 per mg tissue). Crabs infected with BD1 and BD2 showed 100% mortality within 48 h and 62 h of challenge, respectively, with mean Log WSSV copies of 12.06 +/- 0.48 and 9.95 +/- 0.37 per gram tissue, respectively. Moreover, shrimp antimicrobial peptides (AMPs), penaeidin and lysozyme expression were lower in the BD1-challenged group compared to BD2 challenged shrimps. These results collectively demonstrated that relative virulence properties of WSSV based on mortality rate, viral load and expression of host immune genes in artificially infected shrimp PL could be affected by single aa substitution in VP28.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0				2076-2607		WOS:000746987100001	35056639

The myocyte response to oxidative stress involves the progression of cellular changes primarily targeting mitochondria. Similar alterations could be taking place in mitochondria from the skeletal muscle; if that is the case, a simple skeletal muscle biopsy would give information about the cardiac energetic production that could be used as a predictor of the chagasic cardiopathy evolution. Therefore, in the present paper we studied skeletal muscle mitochondrial structure and the enzymatic activity of citrate synthase and respiratory chain complexes I to IV (CI-CIV), in Albino Swiss mice infected with T. cruzi, Tulahuen strain and SGO Z12 and Lucky isolates, along the infection. Changes in the mitochondrial structure were detected in 100% of the mitochondria analyzed from the infected groups: they all presented at least 1 significant abnormality such as increase in their matrix or disorganization of their cristae, which are probably related to the enzymatic dysfunction.When we studied the Krebs cycle functionality through the measurement of the specific citrate synthase activity, we found it to be significantly diminished during the acute phase of the infection in Tulahuen and SGO Z12 infected groups with respect to the control one; citrate synthase activity from the Lucky group was significantly increased (p < 0.05). The activity of this enzyme was reduced in all the infected groups during the chronic asymptomatic phase (p < 0.001) and return to normal values (Tulahuen and SGO Z12) or increased its activity (Lucky) by day 365 post-infection (p.i.). When the mitochondrial respiratory chain was analyzed from the acute to the chronic phase of the infection through the measurement of the activity of complexes I to IV, the activity of CI remained similar to control in Tulahuen and Lucky groups, but was significantly augmented in the SGO Z12 one in the acute and chronic phases (p < 0.05). CII increased its activity in Tulahuen and Lucky groups by day 75 p.i. and in SGO Z12 by day 365 p.i. (p < 0.05). CIII showed a similar behavior in the 3 infected groups, remaining similar to control values in the first two stages of the infection and significantly increasing later on (p < 0.0001). CIV showed an increase in its activity in Lucky throughout all stages of infection (p < 0.0001) and an increase in Tulahuen by day 365 days p.i. (p < 0.0001); SGO Z12 on the other hand, showed a decreased CIV activity at the same time.The structural changes in skeletal muscle mitochondria and their altered enzyme activity began in the acute phase of infection, probably modifying the ability of mitochondria to generate energy; these changes were not compensated in the rest of the phases of the infection. Chagas is a systemic disease, which produces not only heart damage but also permanent skeletal muscle alterations. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

J	KUWABARA, T; SUZUKI, K								A PROLYL ENDOPROTEINASE THAT ACTS SPECIFICALLY ON THE EXTRINSIC 18-KDA PROTEIN OF PHOTOSYSTEM-II - PURIFICATION AND FURTHER CHARACTERIZATION								PLANT AND CELL PHYSIOLOGY				35	4			665	675		10.1093/oxfordjournals.pcp.a078642				JUN 1994	1994	An endoproteinase, which specifically cleaves the Pro12-Leu13 bond of the extrinsic 18-kDa protein of PSII, was purified from PSII membranes of spinach. The presence of 0.05% (w/v) Tween 20 and 1 M NaCl was essential for maintenance of proteolytic activity during the purification. The molecular mass of the enzyme was estimated to be 95 kDa by gel-filtration chromatography. Active fractions contained a polypeptide of 165 kDa that was converted into diffusely stained polypeptides of 54 kDa upon reduction with dithiothreitol. The K-m of the 18-kDa protein in the proteolytic reaction was 0.3 mu M. Inhibition of the proteolysis by compounds that contain prolyl bonds revealed that both a prolyl bond and a positive charge are necessary for interaction with the proteinase, but some other structural factor(s) must also be invoked in the high-affinity interaction between the proteinase and the 18-kDa protein. Reconstitution of NaCl-treated PSII membranes with the 23-kDa protein and/or the 18-kDa protein revealed that the 18-kDa protein was not cleaved by the proteinase when the substrate protein was functionally associated with the membranes. A comparison of the properties of the proteinase with those of a proline-specific endopeptidase from Flavobacterium suggests that these enzymes are quite different in terms of substrate specificity.									27	2	0	0	25	0	27			0032-0781	1471-9053		WOS:A1994NR70500016	8075899	
J	de Wijn, R; van Gorkom, HJ								Kinetics of electron transfer from Q(A) to Q(B) in photosystem II								BIOCHEMISTRY				40	39			11912	11922		10.1021/bi010852r				OCT 2 2001	2001	The oxidation kinetics of the reduced photosystem II electron acceptor Q(A)(-) was investigated by measurement of the chlorophyll fluorescence yield transients on illumination of dark-adapted spinach chloroplasts by a series of saturating flashes. Q(A)(-) oxidation depends on the occupancy of the "Q(B) binding site", where this reaction reduces plastoquinone to plastoquinol in two successive photoreactions. The intermediate, one-electron-reduced plastosemiquinone anion Q(B)(-) remains tightly bound, and its reduction by Q(A)(-) may proceed with simple first-order kinetics. The next photoreaction, in contrast, may find the Q(B) binding site occupied by a plastoquinone, a plastoquinol, or neither of the two, resulting in heterogeneous Q(A)(-) oxidation kinetics. The assumption of monophasic Q(B)(-) reduction kinetics is shown to allow unambiguous decomposition of the observed multiphasic Q(A)(-) oxidation. At pH 6.5 the time constant for Q(A)(-) oxidation was found to be 0.2-0.4 ms with Q(B) in the site, 0.6-0.8 ms with Q(B)(-) in the site, 2-3 ms when the site is empty and Q(B) has to bind first, and of the order of 0.1 s if the site is temporarily blocked by the presence Of Q(B)H(2) or other low-affinity inhibitors such as carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone (CCCP). Effects of pH and H2O/D2O exchange were found to be remarkably nonspecific, No influence of the S-states could be demonstrated.									113	0	1	0	97	0	114			0006-2960			WOS:000171400100028	11570892

The electrochemical degradation of diclofenac (model pollutant) in electrolyte-free water was carried out in batch mode using a solid polymer electrolyte (SPE) electrochemical reactor. For the different MOME compositions, their properties were investigated as a function of the initial drug concentration (IDC) and the electric current density (j). The effects of IDC and j on the degradation of diclofenac were quite similar according to analyses performed using UV-vis and HPLC techniques, wherein it was verified for the different MOMEs that the degradation rate of diclofenac increased with increasing j and IDC. The electrode composition (Ni percentage) exerted only a minor influence on the degradation of diclofenac. On the other hand, a strong influence of j and IDC on the degradation was verified. It was also verified that an increase in IDC resulted in higher values of total current efficiency (TCE) measured for the combustion reaction. Taking into account that the lowest values of the electrical energy per order (E-EO) were obtained for MOME-Ni(0.3)Co(0.7)Oy, it was concluded that the best overall performance for the electrochemical degradation of diclofenac in electrolyte-free water was achieved using this electrode composition.									3	0	0	0	1	0	3				2213-3437		WOS:000411143200087

When thylakoids were irradiated with ultraviolet-B for GO min, a drastic decrease in the rate of whole chain (H2O-->MV) electron transport took place in control thylakoids. Such reduction was found to be mainly due to the loss of photosystem II (H2O-->DCBQ) activity The BASF 13.338 thylakoids (thylakoids isolated from seedlings grown in the presence of BASF 13.338) showed greater resistance to ultraviolet-B radiation. The photosystem I (DCPIPH2-->MV) activity was insignificantly reduced in both control and BASF 13.338 thylakoids. The artificial electron donor manganese chloride (MnCl2) failed to restore the ultraviolet-B radiation-induced loss of photosystem II activity in both control and BASF 13.338 thylakoids, while addition of diphenyl carbazide (DPC) and hydroxylamine (NH2OH) significantly restored the photosystem II activity in control thylakoids. It is concluded that ultraviolet-B irradiation inactivates the donor side of photosystem II. This was also confirmed by data on inhibition of the variable part of chlorophyll fluorescence (F-v) without appreciable change in the F-o level. The: marked loss of photosystem II activity was evidently due to the loss of D1, 33, 23, and 17 kDa polypeptides. This conclusion was confirmed by immunological studies showing that the content of the D1 protein of the photosystem II reaction centre and of the 33, 23 and 16 kDa proteins of the water splitting complex was diminished significantly in ultraviolet-B treated control thylakoids whereas in BASF 13.338 thylakoids a less loss was evident. Thus the inhibitory effect of ultraviolet-B in BASF 13.338 grown thylakoids was less than that in control thylakoids.									5	0	0	0	5	0	5			0176-1617	1618-1328		WOS:000071188800004

ZnWO4 was synthesized by a simple hydrothermal method and doped with nitrogen by precise thermal treatment in the presence of thiourea to obtain perforated nanorods. The structural analysis carried out by X-ray diffractometry (XRD) and first principles density functional theory (DFT) based calculations shows a monoclinic structure. The microstructural and morphological studies show unique perforated nanorods with diameters of 25-20 nm of N-doped ZnWO4. The substitution of nitrogen in place of oxygen atoms was confirmed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The effective substitution of nitrogen in ZnWO4 extends the absorption bands into the visible region. Hence, a computational study of N-doped ZnWO4 was also performed for the investigation and confirmation of its crystal and electronic structures. UV-DRS and analysis of the density of states (DOS) indicate a band gap of approximate to 2.4 experimentally and 2.9 eV theoretically. Considering the band structure, its functionality as a sunlight driven photocatalyst for water splitting and dye degradation has been investigated. N-Doped ZnWO4 exhibits enhanced photocatalytic activity towards hydrogen evolution (5862.1 mol h(-1) g(-1)) for water splitting as well as RhB degradation under natural sunlight. The enhanced photocatalytic activity of N-doped ZnWO4 is attributed to extended absorbance in the visible region, which in turn generates more electron-hole pairs responsible for higher H-2 generation. DFT calculations suggest that the hybridization between O-2p and N-2p at the valence band edge is the reason for the narrowing band gap, and the degree of hybridization is likely to be increased with an increase in N doping which is responsible for the higher activity. The present investigation demonstrates a novel approach for the synthesis of perforated N-doped ZnWO4 with great prospects of scaling up and high yields.									29	1	0	0	2	1	30			2044-4753	2044-4761		WOS:000434386000018		
J	Qian, M; Dao, LA; Debus, RJ; Burnap, RL								Impact of mutations within the putative Ca2+-binding lumenal interhelical a-b loop of the photosystem II D1 protein on the kinetics of photoactivation and H2O-oxidation in Synechocystis sp PCC6803								BIOCHEMISTRY				38	19			6070	6081		10.1021/bi982331i				MAY 11 1999	1999	Mutations D1-D59N and D1-D61E in the putative Ca2+-binding lumenal interhelical a-b loop of the photosystem II (PSII) D1 protein [Chu, H. A., Nguyen, A. P., and Debus (1995), Biochemistry 34, 5839-5858] were further characterized in terms of S-state cycling and photoactivation. Bare platinum electrode measurements of centrifugally deposited O-2-evolving membranes isolated from the a-b loop mutants demonstrated a retarded appearance of O-2 following single turnover flashes, although not to the extent of retardation seen in the Delta psbO mutant, which lacks the extrinsic manganese-stabilizing protein (MSP). Double flash measurements indicate that retarded O-2 release in mutants coincides with a decrease in overall PSII turnover during the S-3-[S-4]-S-0 transition. S-2 and S-3 decay measurements in the isolated membranes indicate that D1-D59N and D1-D61E have faster decays of these higher S-states in contrast to slowed decays in the Delta psbO mutant. Measurements of the flash interval dependence of photoactivation indicate that intermediates of photoactivation [light-dependent assembly of the (Mn)(4) complex] are highly destabilized in the a-b loop mutants compared to both Delta psbO and the wild-type: flash intervals of greater than 2 s result in the nearly complete decay of unstable photointermediate(s) in the D1-D59N and D1-D61E samples, whereas a similar loss does not occur until intervals even greater than 10 s in the Delta psbO and wild-type samples. These results are consistent with a role for the residues D1-D59 and D1-D61 in modulating the redox properties of the higher S-states and, also, possibly in the binding the calcium ion involved in photoactivation.									43	1	0	0	35	0	43			0006-2960			WOS:000080500300013	10320333

Here, we characterized the HaPrx3 homolog at the molecular level from big-belly seahorse (Hippocampus abdominalis) and analyzed its functional activities. The coding sequence of HaPrx3 consists of 726 bp, which encodes 241 amino acids. The predicted molecular weight and theoretical isoelectric point (pI) of HaPrx3 was 26.20 kDa and 7.04, respectively. Multiple sequence alignments revealed that the arrangements of domains, catalytic triads, dimers, and decamer interfaces of HaPrx3 were conserved among Prx sequences of other organisms. According to the phylogenetic analysis, HaPrx3 is clustered with the teleost Prx3 subclade. The highest transcript level of HaPrx3 was detected in the ovary tissue among fourteen healthy fish tissues. The mRNA levels of HaPrx3 in blood and liver tissues were significantly (P < 0.05) upregulated in response to lipopolysaccharide (LPS), polyinosinic-polycytidylic (poly I:C), Edwardsiella tarda, and Streptococcus iniae, suggesting its involvement in immune responses. Under functional properties, insulin disulfide reduction assay confirmed the oxidoreductase activity of recombinant HaPrx3. A cell viability assay and Hoechst staining indicated cell survival ability and reduction of apoptotic activity, respectively. Moreover, a peroxidase activity assay verified peroxidase activity, while a metal-catalyzed oxidation (MCO) assay indicated the DNA protection ability of HaPrx3. Collectively, it is concluded that HaPrx3 may play a significant role in oxidative stress and immune responses against pathogenic infections in big-belly seahorses.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0378-1119	1879-0038		WOS:000609082900003	33333216

Furthermore, activation tagging with T-DNA possessing quadruply repeated enhancers derived from the cauliflower mosaic virus 35S promoter was applied to a transgenic line of Arabidopsis. Mutants resistant to hygromycin B during the growth of calli generated from nongreen roots on callus-inducing medium resulted front the expression of hygromycin B phosphotransferase driven by the RBCS-3B promoter. Three mutant lines, ces101 to ces103 (callus expression of RBCS), were obtained from approximately 4,000 calli resistant to a selectable marker for transformation. The active transcription driven by the RBCS-3B promoter in all the calli of ces mutants was confirmed by expression of both the GUS reporter gene and endogenous RBCS-3B. Chlorophyll and carotenoids, as well as light-dependent 0, evolution, have been detected in the calli of all ces mutants. The loci where T-DNA was integrated in the ces101 line were determined by thermal asymmetric interlaced (TAIL)-PCR. The introduction of a DNA fragment harboring the gene for receptor-like kinase placed under the influence of enhancers into the parental line reproduced the phenotype of ces mutants. We have thus concluded that CES101 is a receptor-like kinase. The strategy presented in this investigation may promise to select a greater number of ces mutants.									13	0	0	0	13	0	14			0032-0781	1471-9053		WOS:000236324800002	16597626

In response to iron deficiency, certain cyanobacteria induce a chlorophyll (Chl)-protein complex, CP43 ', which is encoded by the isiA gene. The deduced amino-acid sequence of CP43 ' predicts some structural similarity to the CP43 polypeptide of photosystem II, but the function of CP43 ' remains uncertain. In order to assess its physiological role, the isiA gene of a cyanobacterium, Synechococcus sp. PCC7942, was inactivated by insertion mutagenesis (giving isiA(-) cells). Compared with isiA- cells, under iron deprivation, wild-type cells showed both lower rates of photosystem Ii-mediated O-2 evolution at limiting light irradiances and decreased yields of room temperature Chi fluorescence at various irradiances. These observations strongly suggest that the decreased photosystem II activity in wild-type cells with CP43 ' is attributable to increased non-radiative dissipation of light energy. In agreement with this hypothesis, isiA- cells were more susceptible to photoinhibition of photosynthesis than wild-type cells, resulting in much slower growth rates under iron limitation. Based on these results, we suggest that CP43' functions as a non-radiative dissipator of light energy, thus protecting photosystem II from excessive excitation under iron-deficient conditions.									99	1	0	0	83	0	101			0950-382X			WOS:000079767100012	10216865

It is accepted that inflammation/oxidative stress are involved in the initiation/evolution of the MetS features. The present work was designed to evaluate the effects of three major cellular ROS production systems on obesity, glucose tolerance, and hepatic steatosis development and on oxidative stress onset. To do so, 40 young male Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into 5 groups: 1-control group, 2-high fat (HF) group (60% energy from fat), 3-HF + MitoQ (mitochondrial ROS scavenger), 4-HF + Apocynin (NADPH oxidase inhibitor), 5-HF + Allopurinol (xanthine oxidase inhibitor). After 8 weeks of these treatments, surrogate MetS, mitochondrial function, and oxidative stress markers were measured in blood and liver. As expected, rats that were fed the HF diet exhibited increased body weight, glucose intolerance, overt hepatic steatosis, and increased hepatic oxidative stress. The impacts of the studied ROS inhibitors on these aspects of the MetS were markedly different. MitoQ showed the most clinically relevant effects, attenuating body weight gain and glucose intolerance provoked by the HF diet. Both Apocynin and Allopurinol showed limited effects suggesting secondary roles of xanthine oxidase (XO) or NADPH oxidase-dependent ROS production in the onset of oxidative stress-dependent obesity, glucose intolerance, and hepatic steatosis process.

In vitro phosphate solubilization, indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) synthesis, and 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid (ACC) deaminase activity were evaluated by solubilization index measurement, colorimetric method, and turbidity assay, respectively. In the pot experiment, the impact of single and mixed inoculation of these strains at four levels (0, 50, 100, and 200mM) of salt stress was evaluated in terms of growth and physiological response of maize plants to salinity.ResultsThe bacterial strains (STN-1, STN-5, and STN-14) were taxonomically classified as Staphylococcus spp. At 5% NaCl level, the strains demonstrated substantial potential for phosphate solubilization, ACC deaminase activity, and IAA production both with and without tryptophan. The inoculation of strains STN-1, STN-5, and mixed inoculation resulted in substantial growth improvement of maize plants along with increased antioxidant enzyme activity and decreased levels of reactive oxygen species. In addition, single inoculation of STN-1 and STN-5 along with mixed inoculation augmented the uptake of N, P, K, and Ca+2 and reduced Na+ uptake.ConclusionCurrent results demonstrated that the strains STN-1 and STN-5 modulated stress-responsive mechanisms and regulated ion balance in induced salinity to promote maize growth.									4	0	0	0	3	1	4			1590-4261	1869-2044		WOS:000470694700005

Their putative synergistic impact as a strategy to potentiate the efficacy of bactericidal antimicrobial agents such as fluoroquinolones is unknown. We generated Escherichia coli mutants that exhibited a suppressed Delta recA gene in combination with inactivated ROS detoxification system genes (Delta sodA, Delta sodB, Delta katG, Delta katE, and Delta ahpC) or inactivated oxidative stress regulator genes (Delta oxyR and Delta rpoS) to evaluate the interplay of both DNA repair and detoxification systems in drug response. Synergistic sensitization effects, ranging from 7.5- to 30-fold relative to the wild type, were observed with ciprofloxacin in double knockouts of recA and inactivated detoxification system genes. Compared to recA knockout, inactivation of an additional detoxification system gene reduced MIC values up to 8-fold. In growth curves, no growth was evident in mutants doubly deficient for recA gene and oxidative detoxification systems at subinhibitory concentrations of ciprofloxacin, in contrast to the recA-deficient strain. There was a marked reduction of viable bacteria in a short period of time when the recA gene and other detoxification system genes (katG, sodA, or ahpC) were inactivated (using absolute ciprofloxacin concentrations). At 4 h, a bactericidal effect of ciprofloxacin was observed for Delta karG Delta recA and Delta ahpC Delta recA double mutants compared to the single ArecA mutant (Delta 3.4 log(10) CFU/ml). Synergistic quinolone sensitization, by targeting the recA gene and oxidative detoxification stress systems, reinforces the role of both DNA repair systems and ROS in antibiotic-induced bacterial cell death, opening up a new pathway for antimicrobial sensitization.									3	0	0	0	3	0	3			0066-4804	1098-6596		WOS:000630326800019	33526493

These model complexes are considered to be mononuclear ([(LMn)-Mn-n](PF6)(m)), dinuclear ([(LMn2IV)-Mn-1a-(mu-O)(2)](PF6)(6)). or trinuclear ([(LMnMnMnLn)-Mn-n-Mn-II-Mn-II-L-II](PF6)(12)) With respect to the number of manganese centers present. Electronic coupling between the manganese ions is strongly antiferromagnetic in the case of the di(mu-oxo)-dimanganese compound [(LMn2IV)-Mn-1a(mu-O)(2)](PF6)(6), where the "ligand" [H2L1a](4+) consists Of two tris(bipyridyl)ruthenium(II)-type units covalentely bound to a bismacrocyclic Me(2)dtne backbone to which the manganese ions are coordinated via an additional phenolate oxygen (Me(2)dtne = 1,2-bis(4-methyl-1,4,7-triazacyclononyl)ethane). Weak antiferromagnetic coupling is observed in compounds [(LMnMnMnLn)-Mn-n-Mn-II-Mn-II-L-II](PF6)(12), where the three metals ale in a linear arrangement (face-sharing octahedral). They are bridged by three phenolate oxygens of each of the deprotonated "ligands" [H3Ln](6+), respectively. Each ligand [H3Ln](6+) (n = 1, 2) consists Of a tacn ring with three pendent arm phenols which are each bound to a tris(bipyridyl)ruthenium(II)-type unit (tacn = 1,4,7-triazacyclononane). In these compounds several electron-transfer steps were detected by electrochemical methods which are assigned to different redox processes located at individual electrochemically active components (Mn, Ru, bipyridyl, phenolate). For example, in the "mononuclear" compounds [(LMn)-Mn-n](PF6), (n = 1 or 2) Mn(II), Mn(II), and Mn(IV) are accessible and three Ru(II) centers are reversibly oxidized to Ru(III), and in addition, the coordinated phenolate can be oxidized to a highly reactive, coordinated phenoxyl radical. In several cases very slow heterogeneous electron-transfer rates were observed for redox processes involving the manganese centers.									63	1	0	0	6	0	63			0020-1669			WOS:000084761500018	11229016

We used a combination of forward genetic screening based on a Proline Dehydrogenase1 (PDH1) promoter-luciferase reporter (PDH1(pro): LUC2) and RNA sequencing of the Pro synthesis mutant p5cs1-4 to identify multiple loci affecting Pro accumulation in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana). Two mutants having high PDH1pro: LUC2 expression and increased Pro accumulation at low water potential were found to be alleles of Cytochrome P450, Family 86, Subfamily A, Polypeptide2 (CYP86A2) and Long Chain Acyl Synthetase2 (LACS2), which catalyze two successive steps in very-long-chain fatty acid (VLCFA) synthesis. Reverse genetic experiments found additional VLCFA and lipid metabolism-related mutants with increased Pro accumulation. Altered cellular redox status is a key factor in the coordination of Pro and VLCFA metabolism. The NADPH oxidase inhibitor diphenyleneiodonium (DPI) induced high levels of Pro accumulation and strongly repressed PDH1(pro): LUC2 expression. cyp86a2 and lacs2 mutants were hypersensitive to diphenyleneiodonium but could be reverted to wild-type Pro and PDH1(pro): LUC2 expression by reactive oxygen species scavengers. The coordination of Pro and redox metabolism also was indicated by the altered expression of chloroplast and mitochondria electron transport genes in p5cs1-4. These results show that Pro metabolism is both influenced by and influences cellular redox status via previously unknown coordination with several metabolic pathways. In particular, Pro and VLCFA synthesis share dual roles to help buffer cellular redox status while producing products useful for stress resistance, namely the compatible solute Pro and cuticle lipids.									49	2	0	0	41	1	51			0032-0889	1532-2548		WOS:000391147700034	27512016

An in-depth understanding of the microstructure and performance of this nano-sized key phase facilitates better application to alkali-activated binders. However, such studies remain little and undetailed. Therefore, our research aims to provide insights into the microstructure of K-A-S-H particles synthesized with accurate stoichiometric control by the hydrothermal method through thermogravimetric analysis (TG), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and BET surface area. The results show that for materials prepared at the curing temperature lower than 80 degrees C, the K-A-S-H products were completely amorphous. With increased curing temperature and time, the K-A-S-H products were transformed from the amorphous phase to the crystalline zeolite phase structure, with a reduction in the specific surface area. The TG results indicate that the crystalline phase contains more non-evaporated water or zeolite water for structural rearrangement. The degree of tetrahedral polymerization slightly decreased with an increase of the K2O/SiO2 ratio as the amount of non-bridged oxygen atoms increased, whereas it gradually increased with an increase of curing temperature and time, as suggested by the FTIR and NMR results. Various K2O/SiO2 ratios resulted in the formation of zeolite K-H and K-G zeolite, both of which exhibited highly polymerized three-dimensional network structures. However, there was no significant effect of the SiO2/Al2O3 ratio on the structure of K-A-S-H products. Overall, these results provide insight into understanding the chemical stability of K-A-S-H.									2	0	0	0	0	1	2				2079-4991		WOS:000516825600063	31888086

Fibre length is an important index of fibre quality. Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) acts as a signalling molecule in the regulation of fibre elongation. Results from in vitro ovule culture suggest that the alteration of fibre cell H2O2 levels affects fibre development. Ascorbate peroxidase (APX) is an important reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavenging enzyme, and we found that GhAPX1A(T)/D-T encoded one member of the previously unrealized group of cytosolic APXs (cAPXs) that were preferentially expressed during the fibre elongation stage. Transgenic cottons with up- and down-regulation of GhAPX1A(T)/D-T were generated to control fibre endogenous levels of H2O2. Suppression of all cAPX (IAO) resulted in a 3.5-fold increase in H2O2 level in fibres and oxidative stress, which significantly suppressed fibre elongation. The fibre length of transgenic lines with over-expression or specific down-regulation of GhAPX1A(T)/D-T did not show any obvious change. However, the fibres in the over-expression lines exhibited higher tolerance to oxidative stress. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in fibres at 10 days post-anthesis (DPA) of IAO lines identified by RNA-seq were related to redox homeostasis, signalling pathways, stress responses and cell wall synthesis, and the DEGs that were up-regulated in IAO lines were also up-regulated in the 10 DPA and 20 DPA fibres of wild cotton compared with domesticated cotton. These results suggest that optimal H2O2 levels and redox state regulated by cytosolic APX are key mechanisms regulating fibre elongation, and dysregulation of the increase in H2O2 induces oxidative stress and results in shorter fibres by initiating secondary cell wall-related gene expression.									41	4	0	0	38	0	45			0022-0957	1460-2431		WOS:000377471700012	27091877

Invading organisms are phagocytosed by circulating hemocytes and neutralised by a combination of hydrolytic enzymes and the production of reactive oxygen species. Phagocytosis, the central feature of the molluscan innate immune system, is an energy-demanding process as a consequence of actin polymerisation which requires a constant supply of ATP. Adenylate kinase, shown to couple local ATP supply and actomyosin assembly in macrophage cell lines, may play a similar role in molluscan hemocytes. Hemocyte conformational changes and chemotaxis are regulated via protein kinase C which is phosphorylated in response to bacterial lipopolysaccharide. ATP utilisation in protein kinase cascades is thought to be quite significant. The vast majority of the ATP required to support cellular functions in animal cells is generated via the mitochondrial electron transport chain. Disruption of this process with antimycin A resulted in a 50 % decrease in ATP levels in Haliotis midae hemocytes which also exhibited reduced phagocytic activity. Phosphoarginine and arginine kinase are thought to play a role in invertebrates that is similar to phosphocreatine and creatine kinase in vertebrates, by supplying additional ATP during periods of high energy demand. The energetically-expensive processes associated with the molluscan innate immune system, such as chemotaxis, phagocytosis, formation and acidification of the phagolysosome, are severely compromised by abiotic stresses such as elevated water temperature and pollutants, reflecting the fine balance that must be maintained to ensure sufficient ATP is available for both general metabolism and the immune response.									18	1	0	0	16	0	19			1824-307X			WOS:000309597900005

Because of the inherent constraints associated with the architecture and materials, the conventional alkaline water electrolyzer and the emerging proton exchange membrane electrolyzer are suffering from low efficiency and high materials/operation costs, respectively. Herein, we design a membrane-free flow electrolyzer, featuring a sandwich-like architecture and a cyclic operation mode, for decoupled overall water splitting. Comprised of two physically-separated compartments with flowing H-2-rich catholyte and O-2-rich anolyte, the cell delivers H-2 with a purity >99.1%. Its low internal ohmic resistance, highly active yet affordable bifunctional catalysts and efficient mass transport enable the water splitting at current density of 750mAcm(-2) biased at 2.1V. The eletrolyzer works equally well both in deionized water and in regular tap water. This work demonstrates the opportunity of combining the advantages of different electrolyzer concepts for water splitting via cell architecture and materials design, opening pathways for sustainable hydrogen generation. Seawater electrolysis is promising for grid-scale H-2 production without freshwater reliance, but high energy costs and detrimental Cl chemistry reduce its practical potential. Here, authors developed an energy-saving hybrid seawater electrolyzer for chlorine-free H-2 production and N2H4 degradation.									15	0	0	0	0	0	15			2041-1723			WOS:000672714900003	34230466

To provide a theoretical basis for the role of SiUCP2 in lipid metabolism, a 2 341-bp full-length cDNA of SiUCP2 from sea urchin Strongylocentrotus intermedius, which encodes 323 amino acids (predicted MW 36.11 kDa) was obtained, and the structure and function of the SiUCP2 gene and its expression at the mRNA and protein level were studied. SiUCP2 had high homology with UCP2 of other species. Expression of SiUCP2 was detected in the order of tube feet > gonads > coelomocytes > intestines. The expression level was the highest in prismatic larvae and lowest in the two-cell stage. Moreover, using in-situ hybridization, we found that SiUCP2 protein was expressed in the gonads and intestine. This study provided a theoretical basis for subsequent studies on the role of SiUCP2 and its regulatory mechanism in lipid metabolism, and for the improvement of gonad quality to obtain a higher economic value from sea urchins.									2	0	0	0	2	0	2			2096-5508	2523-3521		WOS:000643177000004

The application of semiconductor nanomaterials in photocatalysis or photoelectrocatalysis (PEC) for either the degradation of contaminants in the environment or the generation of hydrogen as clean fuel is an effective approach to alleviate these problems. However, the efficiency of such processes remains suboptimal for real applications. Reasonable construction of a built-in electric field is considered to efficiently enhance carrier separation and reduce carrier recombination to improve catalytic performance. In the past decade, as a new method to enhance the built-in electric field, the piezoelectric effect from piezoelectric materials has been extensively studied. In this review, we provide an overview of the properties of piezoelectric materials and the mechanisms of piezoelectricity and ferroelectricity for a built-in electric field. Then, piezoelectric and ferroelectric polarization regulated built-in electric fields that mediate catalysis are discussed. Furthermore, the applications of piezoelectric semiconductor materials are also highlighted, including degradation of pollutants, bacteria disinfection, water splitting for Hz generation, and organic synthesis. We conclude by discussing the challenges in the field and the exciting opportunities to further improve piezo-catalytic efficiency.

Fe transporters are a type of broad-range metal transporter and have different families functioning in different compartments. This study focused on iron-regulated transporter 1 (IRT1), which are mainly responsible for Fe uptake from root, in 17 selected plant species with an emphasis on Brachypodium distachyon, Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, Solanum lycopersicum and Populus trichocarpa species. All IRT1 proteins were observed to belong to the ZIP (PF02535) protein family with eight transmembrane (TM) domains, and have a similar molecular weight (33.86-42.72 kDa, except for C. reinhardtii with 65.83 kDa) and amino acid length (324-408 aa, except for C. reinhardtii with 639 aa), with pI values of 5.31-7.16. The sub-cellular localization of these proteins was predicted to be the plasma membrane. Similar exon numbers were also detected with most genes having 2-3, except for C. reinhardtii (5), Physcomitrella patens (5) and Vitis vinifera (4). In a phylogenetic tree, monocot-dicot separation was not observed in main groups but some subgroups included only monocot or dicot proteins. Predicted interaction partner analysis of AtIRT1 (AT2G30080.1) pointed to main interaction partners either directly related with iron transport or that of other metal ion. The results of this study provide a theoretical reference for elucidating the structural and biological role of IRT1 genes/proteins in plant species.									7	2	0	0	5	0	9			2211-3452	2211-3460		WOS:000361073100013

First published October 3, 2012; doi:10.1152/ajpregu.00340.2012.-Hypoxia-inducible factors 1-3 (HIF1-3) are transcription factors that regulate gene expression in response to hypoxia. Compared with our extensive understanding of HIF-1 and HIF-2, our knowledge of HIF-3 is limited. In this study, we characterized the zebrafish hif-3 alpha gene and determined its temporal and spatial expression, physiological regulation, and biological activity. We show that the chromosomal location, gene structure, and protein structure of zebrafish hif-3 alpha are similar to its mammalian orthologs. When tagged with enhanced green fluorescent protein and transfected into cultured cells, zebrafish Hif-3 alpha was localized in the nucleus and stimulated reporter gene expression in a hypoxia response element-dependent manner. During early development, hif-3 alpha mRNA was detected in all tissues with higher levels in the head. This expression pattern became more apparent in larvae at the 72, 96, and 120 hours post fertilization stages. In the adult stage, hif-3 alpha mRNA was detected in all examined tissues with the highest levels in the ovary. Hypoxia treatment increased Hif-3 alpha protein levels in both embryos and adults. Hypoxia also increased hif-3 alpha mRNA expression levels, and this regulation was tissue-specific. Expression of a stabilized form of Hif-1 alpha in zebrafish embryos increased the expression of igfbp-1a, a Hif-1 target gene, whereas it did not change hif-3 alpha mRNA levels, suggesting that hif-3 alpha is not a Hif-1 alpha target.

N-2 reduction to NH3 is essential to the chemical industry and to the Earth's nitrogen cycle. Industrially, NH3 is synthesized by the Haber-Bosch process under extreme conditions (400-500 degrees C, 200-250 bar), stimulating research into the development of sustainable technologies for NH3 production. Herein, this study demonstrates that ultrathin layered-double-hydroxide (LDH) photocatalysts, in particular CuCr-LDH nanosheets, possess remarkable photocatalytic activity for the photoreduction of N-2 to NH3 in water at 25 degrees C under visible-light irradiation. The excellent activity can be attributed to the severely distorted structure and compressive strain in the LDH nanosheets, which significantly enhances N-2 chemisorption and thereby promotes NH3 formation.									317	44	0	0	22	0	326			0935-9648	1521-4095		WOS:000414756700022	28960530	
J	Piro, Anthony L.								The internal shear of Type Ia supernova progenitors during accretion and simmering								ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL				679	1			616	625		10.1086/529363				MAY 20 2008	2008	A white dwarf (WD) gains substantial angular momentum during the accretion process that grows it toward a Chandrasekhar mass. It is therefore expected to be rotating quickly when it ignites as a Type Ia supernova. The thermal and shearing profiles are important for subsequent flame propagation. We highlight processes that could affect the WD shear during accretion, as well as during the similar to 1000 yr of pre-explosive simmering. Baroclinic instabilities and/or the shear growth of small magnetic fields provide sufficient torque to bring the WD very close to solid-body rotation during accretion. The lack of significant shear makes it difficult to grow a WD substantially past the typical Chandrasekhar mass. Once carbon ignites, a convective region spreads from the center of the WD. This phase occurs regardless of progenitor scenario, and therefore it is of great interest for understanding how the WD interior is prepared before the explosive burning begins. We summarize some of the key properties of the convective region, including a demonstration that the mass enclosed by convection at any given time depends most sensitively on a single parameter that can be expressed as either the ratio of temperatures or densities at the top and bottom of the convection zone. At low Rossby numbers, the redistribution of angular momentum by convection may result in significant shearing at the convective/nonconvective boundary.									48	1	0	0	0	0	49			0004-637X	1538-4357		WOS:000255818600044

Variable to maximum fluorescence (F-v/F-m) ratios of dark-adapted needles were higher in A2 needles than in current year (A1) or senescent (A4) needles. Lower F-v/F-m values in these stages seemed to be caused not by photo-inhibition but by a low photochemical capacity as suggested from the chlorophyll (Ch1) a/b ratios. In isolated thylakoids, lower rates of whole chain and photosystem 2 (PS2) activities were observed in A4 needles, while higher rates were observed in A2 needles. A similar trend was noticed for contents of ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (RuBPC) and total soluble proteins. The artificial exogenous electron donor Mn2+ failed to restore the loss of PS2 activity in 3-year-old (A3) and A4 needles, while diphenylcarbazide and NH2OH significantly restored the loss of PS2 activity. The marked loss of PS2 activity in A4 needles was primarily the result of the loss of 33, 28-25, 23, and 17 kDa polypeptides. A marked loss of RuBPC activity in A4 needles is mainly due to the loss of 15 (SSU) and 55 (LSU) kDa polypeptides.									10	0	0	0	6	0	10			0300-3604	1573-9058		WOS:000242885600008

On illumination, fluorescence emission rises from an initial level O to a maximum P through transient steps, termed J and I. FI kinetics reflect the overall performance of photosystem II (PSII). Although FI kinetics are commonly and easily measured, there is a lack of consensus as to what controls the characteristic series of transients, partially because most of the current models of FI focus on subsets of reactions of PSII, but not the whole. Here we present a model of fluorescence induction, which includes all discrete energy and electron transfer steps in and around PSII, avoiding any assumptions about what is critical to obtaining O J I P kinetics. This model successfully simulates the observed kinetics of fluorescence induction including O J I P transients. The fluorescence emission in this model was calculated directly from the amount of excited singlet-state chlorophyll in the core and peripheral antennae of PSII. Electron and energy transfer were simulated by a series of linked differential equations. A variable step numerical integration procedure (ode15s) from MATLAB provided a computationally efficient method of solving these linked equations. This in silico representation of the complete molecular system provides an experimental workbench for testing hypotheses as to the underlying mechanism controlling the O J I P kinetics and fluorescence emission at these points. Simulations based on this model showed that J corresponds to the peak concentrations of Q(A)(-)Q(B) (Q(A) and Q(B) are the first and second quinone electron acceptor of PSII respectively) and Q(A)(-)Q(B)(-) and I to the first shoulder in the increase in concentration of Q(A)(-)Q(B)(2-). The P peak coincides with maximum concentrations of both Q(A)(-)Q(B)(2-) and PQH(2). In addition, simulations using this model suggest that different ratios of the peripheral antenna and core antenna lead to differences in fluorescence emission at O without affecting fluorescence emission at J, I and P. An increase in the concentration of Q(B)-nonreducing PSII centers leads to higher fluorescence emission at O and correspondingly decreases the variable to maximum fluorescence ratio (F-v/F-m).									207	17	11	0	202	0	233			0032-0935	1432-2048		WOS:000233725000012	16411287

The photocatalyst was characterized for structural, magnetic, electrical and optical properties to check its suitability for photocatalytic degradation of methyl blue from wastewater. The plasma-treated photocatalyst exhibits more porous morphology than the untreated one. The crystallite size of untreated photocatalyst was calculated about 36 nm, which increased to 39 nm on plasma treatment. Similarly, the lattice parameter before and after plasma treatment was measured about 8.3552 angstrom and 8.4873 angstrom, respectively. The untreated photocatalyst had the band gap of 5.17 eV, which reduced to 4.98 eV on plasma treatment. The light absorption peak of the photocatalyst increased from 578 to 599 nm on plasma treatment. The plasma-treated and untreated photocatalysts showed 91% and 74% dye degradation efficiency, respectively. These catalysts retained 97% and 93% efficiency, respectively, after five cycles of dye degradation. The saturation magnetization was measured about 0.79 emu/g and 0.66 emu/g, respectively. The coercivity of untreated sample was measured about 0.3 kOe, which reduced to 0.1 kOe on plasma treatment.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0947-8396	1432-0630		WOS:000732713400001

In the case, long-term durability of molecular devices is a crucial factor to determine their practical application. Here, an efficient composite molecular anode was assembled by immobilization of charge-neutral mononuclear Ru1 complex on COOH-functionalized multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTsCOOH) sticking on a glassy carbon (GC) electrode (Ru1/MWCNTsCOOH/GC). The prepared hybrid anode showed a low onset overpotential of only 380 mV for electrocatalytic water oxidation. Moreover, the anode displayed a steady catalytic current density of 1.25 mA/cm(2) for more than 5 h at the overpotential of 580 mV, a high TON of 186000 (5 h), a TOF of 10.3 s(-1) and a faradic efficiency of 96%, indicating the significant efficiency and extremely durability. The excellent durability of the molecular anode should be attributed to the key charge-neutral catalytic intermediates (Ru1a similar to d) of the catalytic step and the two long flexible carbon chains of the catalyst.

By means of hybrid density functional theory calculations, we systematically study engineering its band gap via doping 4d and 5d transition-metals M (M = Zr, Nb, Mo, Tc, Ru, Rh, Pd, Hf, Ta, W, Re, Os, Ir, and Pt) and chalcogen elements Y (Y = S and Se). We find that transition-metal dopant M either has no effect on the STO band gap or introduces detrimental midgap states except for Pd and Pt that are able to reduce the STO band gap. In contrast, doping S and Se significantly reduces STO's direct band gap, thus, leading to appreciable optical absorption transitions in the visible spectral range. Our findings provide that Pd-, S-, and Se-doped STO are potential promising photocatalysts for water splitting under visible light irradiation thereby providing insightful theoretical guides for experiments to improve the photocatalytic activity of STO.									7	0	0	0	0	0	7			2475-9953			WOS:000661934800003

In this work, environmentally friendly porous FexSiy intermetallics are prepared by elemental powder reactive synthesis as anodes in zinc electrowinning for the first time. The as-prepared porous FexSiy anodes (Fe3Si, Fe5Si3, and FeSi) have been investigated in terms of electrochemical performance. Among the three anodes, porous Fe5Si3 anode shows relatively better comprehensive properties in 160 g.L-1 H2SO4. Porous Fe5Si3 anode exhibits electrocatalytic activity and long-term stability under the condition of zinc electrowinning, which guarantees a service life up to 400 h. The activity for OER shows that porous Fe5Si3 anode is delivering an overpotential of 1.072 V and tafel slope of 326.6 mV.dec at current density of 50 mA.cm(-2). The electrocatalytic activity is positively correlated with the open porosity. The oxides formed in the anode surface are mainly composed of Fe2O3 and amorphous SiO2, which protect the anode against corrosion and help to the activity for OER. This result demonstrated that Fe5Si3 as alternative anode material has potential application value in industry. (C) 2020 The Authors.

The crystal phase, morphology and chemical composition of these CuCoO2 (CCO) based samples were comprehensively characterized by powder X-ray diffraction (XRD), field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and Raman spectroscopy. The size of CCCaO nanosheets decreased with increasing Ca dopant concentration, and the optimized CCCaO nanosheets (similar to 490 nm in lateral size and similar to 15 nm in thickness) were much smaller than CCO nanocrystals (similar to 540 nm in lateral size and 85 nm in thickness). The specific surface area of these CCO based samples increased with increasing Ca content, and the optimized CCCaO nanosheets present a high BET surface area of 28 m(2) g(-1). XPS and Raman spectroscopy analyses indicate Ca2+ dopant substitution on the Cu+ site in CCCaO nanosheets. Moreover, the effects of Ca2+ doping on the optical and electrical properties of these CCO based samples were further studied. The optical properties measured at room temperature show high absorbability (up to 90%) in the ultraviolet-visible-near infrared (UV-VIS-NIR) region, and the indirect band gap shows a significant blue-shift with increasing Ca2+ concentration. The CCO nanocrystals possess a higher electrical conductivity than the CCCaO nanosheets, and present good conductivities of around 12.81, 4.47 and 0.69 s m(-1) for the CCO and CCCaO samples at room temperature. The facile fabrication process, tunable crystallite sizes, and excellent optical absorption and electrical properties of these CCO based nanomaterials are encouraging for the development of future applications in photoelectric devices.									12	1	0	0	0	0	12			1477-9226	1477-9234		WOS:000486226200022	31475701

However, this is also very challenging because narrowing the semiconductor band gap lowers the driving force for photoreactions. Herein, a highly active perovskite BaNbO2N exhibiting photoexcitation up to 740 nm for water oxidation is reported. The synthesis route, consisting of moderate nitridation and subsequent annealing in inert Ar flow, enhances the crystallinity of the BaNbO2N surface without inducing the reduction of the Nb species. As a result, a particulate BaNbO2N photoanode exhibits a photocurrent of 5.2 mA cm(-2) at 1.23 V-RHE under simulated solar irradiation, which is the highest yet reported for an oxynitride responsive at wavelengths above 600 nm. Suppressing the reduction of B-site cations during the synthesis of perovskite AB(O,N)(3), which otherwise results in surface defects or impurities, is critical for achieving high water oxidation activity.									44	1	0	0	1	0	44			1614-6832	1614-6840		WOS:000442731100002

However, because of the difficulties in the preparation of atomically thick 2D nanosheets, especially for the materials with non-layered structures, current research interests mainly focused on the limited layered samples. Furthermore, owing to the lack of executable characterization techniques for obtaining accurate structural information of ultra thin 2D nanosheets, it is still challenging to understand the correlations between the atomic/electronic structures and their intrinsic properties. In this review, we focus on the recent progresses in synthetic strategies of ultrathin 2D nanosheets, especially for the materials with non-layered structures, and survey effective methods for the regulation of the electronic structures of these ultrathin 2D nanosheets. In addition, we also highlight the clear structure-property relationships of ultrathin 2D nanosheets and overview their applications in photocatalysis, electrocatalysis, energy storage device, electronic device and biological area. Finally, on the basis of the current progresses, the major challenges and opportunities on ultrathin 2D nanosheets are also presented, which could bring new opportunities for future research in the field of chemistry.

The length scales pertinent to the initiation of the detonation are notoriously unresolved in multidimensional stellar simulations, prompting the use of results of one-dimensional simulations at higher resolution, such as those performed for this work, as guidelines for deciding whether or not conditions reached in the higher dimensional full star simulations successfully would lead to the onset of a detonation. Spontaneous initiation relies on the existence of a suitable gradient in self-ignition (induction) times of the fuel, which we set up with a spatially localized nonuniformity of temperature-a hot spot. We determine the critical (smallest) sizes of such hot spots that still marginally result in a detonation in WD matter by integrating the reactive Euler equations with the hydrodynamics code flash. We quantify the dependences of the critical sizes of such hot spots on composition, background temperature, peak temperature, geometry, and functional form of the temperature disturbance, many of which were hitherto largely unexplored in the literature. We discuss the implications of our results in the context of modeling of SNe Ia.									88	1	0	0	1	0	88			0004-637X			WOS:000265350100041

It also describes the formation of spinel NiCo2O4 layers on several substrates using the Sol-Gel method. High area Ni and multilayer Ni-Co alloy coatings have been obtained with a new electrodeposition methodology that allows the complete removal of Zn. This generates highly porous surfaces with roughness factors of 2200 for Ni and 4400 for Ni-Co. The hydrogen overpotential measured for these coatings at 135 mA cm(-2) and 70 degrees C were 0.1 and 0.09 V, respectively. Rough Ni-Fe coatings having 40 at % of Ni were deposited from an acetate bath and were activated by anodic polarization in HCl. Analyses by SEM and dissolution voltammetry suggest that the activation removes a passivating layer on the surface, revealing an active Ni-Fe phase. Polarization curves obtained at different temperatures presented Tafel slopes of 63-80 for 25-80 degrees C and an apparent activation energy of 55 kJ mol(-1). Long term operation in 4 M NaOH at 135 mA cm(-2) showed a hydrogen overpotential of 0.16 V at 70 degrees C, a value considerably lower than 0.35 V found for smooth Ni or 0.49 V for an equivalent Ni-Fe metallurgical alloy. Active anodes were prepared by the synthesis of NiCo2O4 spinel oxides using the Sol-Gel method on Ni and Ti substrates. The coatings showed an oxygen overpotential of nearly 0.3 V, approximately 0.6 V less than that obtained for pure Ni oxide anodes, under the experimental conditions presented above. These anode materials were tested in long term operations at 135 mA cm(-2) and 70 degrees C for periods up to 200 h, without any evidence of a decrease in their catalytic activity.

Special attention is paid to Rb and Tc, and to the ratio of the heavy s-process species to the light s-process elements. Abundances are derived in LTE, both by using model atmospheres in which the carbon and oxygen abundances are nearly equal and by using curves of growth. Spectrum synthesis is used for critical lines such as the 5924-Angstrom line of Tc and the 7800-Angstrom line of Rb. For most of the heavy-element stars the enhancement of the s-process elements is about a factor of 10. The ratio of the heavy to light s-process species is not far from solar, except for RR Her for which the same ratio is + 0.45 dex. For Tc the blending by other lines is severe. While we have probably detected the 5924-Angstrom line, we can only present abundances in the Iess-than-or-equaI-to category. For Rb, whose abundance is sensitive to the Rb-85/Rb-87 ratio and hence to the neutron density during s-process production, we find a considerable range of abundances, indicating a neutron density from 10(6) to greater than or similar to 10(8) cm(-3) for the SC stars. For the four S stars the range is from 10(7) to greater than or similar to 10(8) cm(-3) Recent calculations by Gallino et al. show that neutron densities near 10(7) cm(-3) favour the C-13 source for neutrons, while densities greater than 10(8) cm(-3) may be associated with neutrons from the Ne-22 source.									58	2	0	0	0	0	58			0035-8711	1365-2966		WOS:000071557600018

Lancet Regional Health. Americas				8				100177	100177		10.1016/j.lana.2021.100177				2022-Apr	2022	BACKGROUND: Indigenous peoples are vulnerable to pandemics, including to the coronavirus disease (COVID)-19, since it causes high mortality and specially, the loss of elderly Indigenous individuals.METHODS: The epidemiological data of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) by SARS-CoV-2 infection or other etiologic agents (OEA) among Brazilian Indigenous peoples during the first year of COVID-19 pandemic was obtained from a Brazilian Ministry of Health open-access database to perform an observational study. Considering only Indigenous individuals diagnosed with SARS by COVID-19, the epidemiology data were also evaluated as risk of death. The type of sample collection for virus screening, demographic profile, clinical symptoms, comorbidities, and clinical evolution were evaluated. The primary outcome was considered the death in the Brazilian Indigenous individuals and the secondary outcome, the characteristics of Brazilian Indigenous infected by SARS-CoV-2 or OEA, as the need for intensive care unit admission or the need for mechanical ventilation support. The statistical analysis was done using Logistic Regression Model. Alpha of 0.05.FINDINGS: A total of 3,122 cases of Indigenous individuals with SARS in Brazil were reported during the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic. Of these, 1,994 were diagnosed with COVID-19 and 730/1,816 (40.2%) of them died. The death rate among individuals with SARS-CoV-2 was three-fold increased when compared to the group of individuals with OEA. Several symptoms (myalgia, loss of smell, and sore throat) and comorbidities (cardiopathy, systemic arterial hypertension, and diabetes mellitus) were more prevalent in the COVID-19 group when compared to Indigenous individuals with OEA. Similar profile was observed considering the risk of death among the Indigenous individuals with COVID-19 who presented several symptoms (oxygen saturation <95%, dyspnea, and respiratory distress) and comorbidities (renal disorders, cardiopathy, and diabetes mellitus). The multivariate analysis was significant in differentiating between the COVID-19-positive and non-COVID-19 patients [X2 (7)=65.187; P-value<0.001]. Among the patients' features, the following contributed in relation to the diagnosis of COVID-19: age [≥43 years-old [y.o.]; OR=1.984 (95%CI=1.480-2.658)]; loss of smell [OR=2.373 (95%CI=1.461-3.854)]; presence of previous respiratory disorders [OR=0.487; 95%CI=0.287-0.824)]; and fever [OR=1.445 (95%CI=1.082-1.929)]. Also, the multivariate analysis was able to predict the risk of death [X2 (9)=293.694; P-value<0.001]. Among the patients' features, the following contributed in relation to the risk of death: male gender [OR=1.507 (95%CI=1.010-2.250)]; age [≥60 y.o.; OR=3.377 (95%CI=2.292-4.974)]; the need for ventilatory support [invasive mechanical ventilation; OR=24.050 (95%CI=12.584-45.962) and non-invasive mechanical ventilation; OR=2.249 (95%CI=1.378-3.671)]; dyspnea [OR=2.053 (95%CI=1.196-3.522)]; oxygen saturation <95% [OR=1.691 (95%CI=1.050-2.723)]; myalgia [OR=0.423 (95%CI=0.191-0.937)]; and the presence of kidney disorders [OR=3.135 (95%CI=1.144-8.539)].INTERPRETATION: The Brazilian Indigenous peoples are in a vulnerable situation during the COVID-19 pandemic and presented an increased risk of death due to COVID-19. Several factors were associated with enhanced risk of death, as male sex, older age (≥60 y.o.), and need for ventilatory support; also, other factors might help to differentiate SARS by COVID-19 or by OEA, as older age (≥43 y.o.), loss of smell, and fever.FUNDING: Fundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado de Sao Paulo (Foundation for Research Support of the State of Sao Paulo; #2021/05810-7).									3	0	0	0	1	0	3				2667-193X		MEDLINE:35018359	35018359	
J	Wang, Yujie; Rong, Mingyue; Zheng, Jiandong; Rui, Zebao				Rui, Zebao/G-4165-2012				Morphology control of the hematite photoanodes for photoelectrochemical water splitting								INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY				45	56			31667	31677		10.1016/j.ijhydene.2020.08.230				NOV 13 2020	2020	The morphology of hematite photoanode is a significant relevant factor in its photo-electrochemical (PEC) performance. Hematite nanowires and nanocubes as well as nanorods with intentional Sn doping were prepared by hydrothermal processes containing disparate additives. The band-gap decreases in the sequence of nanowires, nanorods and nanocubes. Compared with nanorods, nanowires show higher carrier density but a lower light absorbance. With both inhibited bulk and surface charge recombination, nanowires achieve an enhanced photocurrent. Meanwhile, it is more complicated for the charge conversion in the hematite nanocubes. Light absorption is limited due to the compact arrangement of nanocubes. Besides, nanocubes show a highly oriented (104) plane which is unfavorable to the charge conductivity. Despite the negative factors hindering its PEC performance, the extremely high carrier density in the nanocubes benefits to the distinctly enhanced photocurrent collected from the hematite samples annealed at 550 and 650 degrees C respectively. However, the superiority of hematite nanocubes annealed under 800 degrees C is restricted by the high onset potential. Still, attributed to the high surface charge transfer efficiency, the hematite nanocubes achieve the highest photocurrent among the samples at biases above 1.3 V. Electrodes made of hematite nanorods, nanowires and nanocubes annealed at 800 degrees C achieve a photocurrent of 1.01, 1.30 and 1.40 mA cm(-2) at 1.6 V vs. RHE, respectively.

The 1T-MoS2@Ti3C2 composite exhibits outstanding NRR activity with a faradic efficiency (FE) of 10.94% and a NH3 yield rate of 30.33 mu g h(-1) mg(cat)(-1) at -0.3 V versus RHE. Notably, the 1T-MoS2@Ti3C2 composite displays excellent stability and durability during the recycling test. The outstanding NRR catalytic activity is primarily attributed to the synergy effect between 1T-MoS2 and Ti3C2 MXene. In addition, the isotopic experiment confirms the synthesized NH3 deriving from the conversion of the supplied nitrogen.									62	6	0	0	4	0	64			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000541679900055	32419447

In this study, catalyst Ni12P5 is successfully modified on Co3S4 by two step hydrothermal methods. The catalyst Ni12P5 has a good promoting effect on the photocatalytic hydrogen production of Co3S4. Composite samples 8% Ni12P5/Co3S4 had the highest photocatalytic hydrogen production activity, and the hydrogen yield reach 4922.4molg(-1)h(-1), which is 4.8 times higher than that of the original Co3S4 under visible light. The composite sample Ni12P5/Co3S4 maintains good stability of photocatalytic hydrogen production in three cycles. Ni12P5/Co3S4 samples are characterized by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), Ultraviolet-visible diffuse reflectance spectra (UV-Vis DRS), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), electrochemistry and fluorescence (PL), and their physical and chemical properties was analyzed. Electrochemical measurements show that the enhancement of photocatalytic activity is attributed to the high separation and migration of photoinduced electrons and holes, which is consistent with the photocatalytic hydrogen production activity. The results provide a novel idea for the synthesis of other non-noble metal composite photocatalyst, and have important inspiration significance.									7	0	0	0	0	0	7			0957-4522	1573-482X		WOS:000472079200078

However, most of the research has been focused on the shape-controlled Au-Pd alloy NCs with a single-crystal structure. Due to the existence of high-energy atoms on the twin defects, twinned structures usually will further increase their catalytic activities. It is necessary to develop a method to prepare the Au-Pd alloy with twinned structures and investigate their catalytic properties. Herein, we successfully synthesized Au-Pd alloy tripods and bipyramids with twinned structures by the cooperation of cetyltrimethyl ammonium chloride (CTAC) and cetyltrimethyl ammonium bromide (CTAB). The tripods contain one twin plane, while the bipyramids consist of a fivefold-twinned structure. In addition, the tripods and bipyramids are both exposed by high-energy facets. We proposed that the tripods and bipyramids are evolved from bipyramid seeds and fivefold twinned seeds, respectively. The as-prepared Au-Pd tripods and bipyramids performed better activity for electrocatalytic oxidation of formic acid compared to the cubic Au-Pd nanoparticles.									11	0	0	0	0	0	11			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000369591400038	26763593	
B	Scott, D.								Microwave diagnostics of atmospheric plasmas								Microwave diagnostics of atmospheric plasmas								115 pp	115 pp						2015	2015	Plasma treatment of biological tissues has tremendous potential due to the wide range of applications. Most plasmas have gas temperatures which greatly exceed room temperature. These are often utilized in electro-surgery for cutting and coagulating tissue. Another type of plasma, referred to as cold atmospheric plasma, or CAP, is characterized by heavy particle temperatures which are at or near room temperature. Due to this lack of thermal effect, CAP may provide less invasive medical procedures. Additionally, CAP have been demonstrated to be effective at targeting cancer cells while minimizing damage to the surrounding tissue. A recently fabricated Microwave Electron Density Device (MEDD) utilizes microwave scattering on small atmospheric plasmas to determine the electron plasma density. The MEDD can be utilized on plasmas which range from a fraction of a millimeter to several centimeters at atmospheric pressure when traditional methods cannot be applied. Microwave interferometry fails due to the small size of the plasma relative to the microwave wavelength which leads to diffraction and negligible phase change; electrostatic probes introduce very strong perturbation and are associated with difficulties of application in strongly-collisional atmospheric conditions; and laser Thomson scattering is not sensitive enough to measure plasma densities less than 1012 cm-3. The first part of this dissertation provides an overview of two types of small atmospheric plasma objects namely CAPs and plasmas utilized in the electro-surgery. It then goes on to describe the fabrication, testing and calibration of the MEDD facility. The second part of this dissertation is focused on the application of the MEDD and other diagnostic techniques to both plasma objects. A series of plasma images that illustrate the temporal evolution of a discharge created by an argon electrosurgical device operating in the coagulation mode and its behavior was analyzed. The discharge of the argon electrosurgical system was studied using an Intensified Charge-Coupled Device (ICCD) and the MEDD. The plasma density was measured and found to be in the range of (7.5-9.5) x 1015 cm-3 for applied powers of 15-60 Watts. The discharge can be classified as a glow discharge of alternating current with a contracted positive column. The discharge ignites every half-wave of the driving voltage when voltage increases above the breakdown threshold of about 300 Volts and is interrupted at the end of each half-wave when the voltage approaches zero. Additionally, it was shown that the plasma discharges on the target object during the positive half-wave of the voltage. The power distribution was also analyzed. It was found that 60-70% of the input power is delivered into the tissue and the remaining 30-40% is consumed by the plasma column between the electrosurgical probe and tissue. The application of the MEDD to a helium CAP revealed the temporal dynamics of the discharge. It was observed that streamer development associated with the measured plasma density peak is developing on the decaying part of the main inter-electrode discharge. The third part of the dissertation focuses on the simulation of a helium CAP. A one-dimensional model of a helium CAP was used to simulate twenty-one oxygen, helium, and nitrogen species. One hundred and forty reactions were successfully used. The predicted maximum and average densities of the species were tabulated. Graphs of the species densities were presented showing the change in densities with respect to the radius of the CAP. The plasma bullets can be seen via these graphs, with most species displaying maximum densities at a radius which is not the center of the CAP. This shows that the plasma bullets are a disk-like structure at the moment of time presented. Values of E/p were varied from 20 - 30 volts/cm Torr. Based on experimental results of moments in time with which the maximum plasma density occurs, this data can be used to predict the actual E/p values for future experiments.									0	0	0		0	0	0					978-13-215-2332-4	INSPEC:15638675

The highest photocurrent at 1.1 V vs. RHE was achieved for a BiVO4/CdS composite (4.54 mA cm(-2)), compared with CdS (1.19 mA cm(-2)) and bare BiVO4 (2.1 mA cm(-2)), under AM 1.5G illumination. This improvement in the photoefficiency can be ascribed to both the enhanced optical absorption properties and the charge separation due to the heterojunction formation between BiVO4 and CdS. Furthermore, the BiVO4/CdS photoanode was protected with a CoOx layer to substantially increase the photostability of the material. The new BiVO4/CdS/CoOx nanostructure exhibited a highly stable photocurrent density of similar to 5 mA cm(-2). The capability to produce O-2 was locally investigated by scanning photoelectrochemical microscope, which showed a good agreement between photocurrent and O-2 reduction current maps. This work develops an efficient route to improve the photo-electrochemical performance of BiVO4 and its long-term stability.									4	0	0	0	1	0	4				2073-4344		WOS:000666931300001

Electron microprobe and laser ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry analyses of chromite and silicate minerals in layers between the UG2 chromitite and the Merensky Reef reveal variations in major and trace element compositions that defy explanation with existing models of cumulate mineral-melt evolution. The anomalous features are best developed at sharp contacts of chromitite with adjacent anorthosite and pyroxenite cumulates. Here, chromite compositions change abruptly from high and constant Mg/(Mg + Fe2+) and Fe2+/Fe3+ ratios in chromitite layers to variable and generally lower values in chromite disseminated in silicate layers. Furthermore, the composition of disseminated chromites varies depending on the host silicate assemblage; for example, in Ti, V and Zn contents. Importantly, the abrupt change in chromite composition across the chromitite-silicate layer contacts is independent of the thickness of the chromitite layer and the estimated mass proportions of chromite to intercumulus liquid. Chemical variations in plagioclase are also abrupt and some are hard to reconcile with conventional models of re-equilibration with intercumulus liquid. Among those features is the decoupling of alkalis from other incompatible lithophile elements. In comparison with cumulus plagioclase, intercumulus poikilitic plagioclase in chromitite layers is enriched in rare earth elements but strongly depleted in equally incompatible Li, K and Rb. Strong alkali depletion is also observed in intercumulus pyroxene from ultramafic cumulates and chromitite layers. To explain these features, we propose a new model of post-cumulus recrystallization, which intensifies the modal layering in the crystal-liquid mush, producing the observed sequence of nearly monomineralic layers of chromitite, pyroxenite and anorthosite that define the cyclic units. The crucial element of this model is the establishment of redox potential gradients at contacts between chromite-rich cumulates and adjacent silicate layers owing to peritectic reactions between the crystals and intercumulus melt. Because basaltic melts are ionic electrolytes with Na+ as the main charge carrier, the redox potential gradient induces electrochemical migration of Na+ and other alkali ions. Selective mobility of alkalis can explain the enigmatic features of plagioclase composition in the cyclic units. Sodium migration is expected to cause remelting of previously formed cumulates and major changes in modal mineral proportions, which may eventually result in the formation of sharply divided monomineralic layers. The observed variations in ferric/ferrous iron ratios in chromite from the cyclic units and Fe distribution in plagioclase imply a redox gradient of the order of 0 center dot 9 log-units fO(2), equivalent to a potential gradient of 60 mV. Preliminary estimates suggest that the resulting electrochemical flux of Na+ ions is sufficient to mobilize about one-third of the total Na content of a 1 m thick mush layer within 10 years.The proposed electrochemical effect of post-cumulus crystallization is enhanced by the presence of cumulus chromite but, in principle, it can operate in any type of cumulates in which ferrous and ferric iron species are distributed unequally between crystalline and liquid phases.									17	1	1	0	0	0	19			0022-3530	1460-2415		WOS:000360588900008

It is one of several unmined deposits in the same province as the giant Olympic Darn deposit, and it lies beneath more than 500 in of younger cover rocks. The Oak Dam East breccia complex formed in a near-surface environment and was characterized by an early history of skarnlike albite-calc-silicate +/- magnetite formation (from hypersaline, 400 degrees-500 degrees C fluids). Large-scale breeciation was an early feature, and the resulting complex was progressively filled in and replaced by (1) hematite and goethite (hematite stage 1), (2) magnetite-apatite-quartz +/- actinolite (magnetite stage), (3) hematite-goethite-quaitzchaleedony-pytite-chlolite-monazite (hematite stage II), and (4) chalcopyrite-pitchblende-illite-hydromuscovite-florencite-carrolite (Cu-U-(Au) mineralization stage). Hematite stage 11 assemblages are volumetrically most abundant and were formed from fluids of 1 to 10 wt percent NaCl equiv that were boiling at 170 degrees to 190 degrees C and bad 6180 values more negative than -3.7 to +1.7 per mil, interpreted as meteoric water. The upper 200 in of the breccia complex contains spectacular colloform hematite void fillings, interpreted to have replaced hydrothermal goethite. The Cu-U mineralized zones resemble Olympic Dam ore in terms of geometries, being grossly subhorizontal, 10 to 70 in thick, and crosscutting with respect to the host breccias. The mineralization is zoned vertically from pyrite (delta S-34 = -6 to 0%omicron) at depth to shallower chalcopyrite (delta S-34 = -14 to -7%omicron). High-grade pitchblende occurs centrally within the chalcopyrite zone (e.g., 10 in of 0.46% Cu and 3,700 ppm U3O8), straddling a boundary between K mica + illite alteration and underlying Fe-Mg chlorite alteration.The deposit is assigned to the 1570 to 1.595 Ma iron oxide Cu-Au-U event in the eastern Gawler craton on the basis of its similarity to other Cu-Au-U deposits in the province. An LA-ICPMS Pb isotope age for monazite in hematite stage II was calculated to be 1455 +/- 20 Ma, and possibly as young as 1370 +/- 54 Ma, to explain all isotopic data. This is air age of isotopic resetting. Our preferred model is that Cu-U mineralization developed within a stratified hydrothermal brine complex analogous to the Salton Sea geothermal system. Copper, Fe, and S in the deep brine was sourced from an evolving deep reservoir, with local compositional controls on sulfur isotopes including cooling, boiling, and replacement of previous pyrite. Chalcopyrite (+/- U) veins and disseminations formed as a result of mixing with overlying, steam-heated, U-rich, saline ground water. Mixing-induced cooling and dilution only occurred episodically, following hydrofracturing events that ephemerally linked the brine layers within the substantially cemented upper complex. By contrast, high-grade UO2 formation occurred as deep upflow waned, via reaction of the upper brine with hematite stage II Fe-Mg chlorite along an interface that descended with time. This resulted in an increase of U grades through time caused by leaching and reprecipitation.									48	1	0	0	2	0	49			0361-0128	1554-0774		WOS:000254227400006

This protein contains one tryptophan and eight tyrosine residues, belonging to a "B type protein". It was found that the 33-kDa protein fluorescence is very different from most B type proteins containing both tryptophan and tyrosine residues. For most B type proteins studied so far, the fluorescence emission is dominated by the tryptophan emission, with the tyrosine emission hardly being detected when excited at 280 nm. However, for the present 33-kDa protein, both tyrosine and tryptophan fluorescence emissions were observed, the fluorescence emission being dominated by the tyrosine residue emission upon a 280 nm excitation. The maximum emission wavelength of the 33-kDa protein tryptophan fluorescence was at 317 nm, indicating that the single tryptophan residue is buried in a very strong hydrophobic region. Such a strong hydrophobic environment is rarely observed in proteins when using tryptophan fluorescence experiments.

Herein, we report electronically coupled metallic hybrids of NiFe layered double hydroxide nanosheet/Ti3C2 MXene quantum dots deposited on a nitrogen-doped graphene surface (LDH/MQD/NG) for high-performance flexible Zn-air batteries (ZABs). As verified from the Mott-Schottky and Nyquist plots, as well as spectroscopic, electrochemical, and computational analyses, the electronic and chemical coupling of LDH/MQD/NG modulates the local electronic and surface structure of the active LDH to provide metallic conductivity and abundant active sites, leading to significantly improved bifunctional activity and electrocatalytic kinetics. The rechargeable ZABs with LDH/MQD/NG hybrids are superior to the previous LDH-based ZABs, demonstrating a high power density (113.8 mW cm(-2)) and excellent cycle stability (150 h at 5 mA cm(-2)). Moreover, the corresponding quasi solid-state ZABs are completely flexible and practical, affording a high power density of 57.6 mW cm(-2) even in the bent state, and in real-life operation of tandem cells for powering various electronic devices.									23	1	0	0	0	0	23				2567-3165		WOS:000667903000001

In this study, a cobalt-phosphate (Co-Pi) layer was deposited on hematite photoanodes (alpha-Fe2O3) in order to increase the lifetime of the photogenerated holes and to lower the applied bias. The influence of the Co-Pi catalyst thickness, the pH of deposition, and the scan rate of the photoelectrochemical (PEC) measurements were optimized using the Taguchi statistical method. An L9 orthogonal array, with the three factors of control at three levels, was employed to determine the optimum conditions for water splitting of neutral water with minimum applied bias. After depositing Co-Pi layer on the alpha-Fe2O3 at different conditions, the PEC was measured via the linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) and chronoamperometry. The analysis of variance of the mean overpotential in comparison with the bare hematite and the signal-to-noise ratio indicated the great influence of catalyst thickness on the decreasing of overpotential for photo-assisted water splitting in comparison with the bare alpha-Fe2O3. The characterization of the catalyst and the alpha-Fe2O3 morphology were carried out by SEM, XRD, and EDS. The optimized photoanode showed an enhancement of around two times for photocurrent and 1.5 times in incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) compared to the bare alpha-Fe2O3. These findings result in an understanding of the role of the Co-Pi catalyst role in improving the hematite photoanode.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1023-1935	1608-3342		WOS:000526727500009

Prior to the photoanode development, the ALD growth optimization of NiFeOx is carried out by the super-cycle combination approach and confirmed through structural analysis and high-resolution focused-ion beam transmission electron microscopy imaging. An ultrathin layer of NiFeOx (3 nm) with 25 at.% of Ni over hematite photoanodes (Sn-Fe2O3/NFO25) exhibits the highest photocurrent density at 1.23 VRHE. The roles of the surface states of hematite are elucidated through electrochemical and compositional investigations. The NiFeOx nanolayer effectively annihilates the surface states on the hematite nanorod, subsequently unraveling the inherent photovoltage. The new charge transport path is observed via interfacial analysis, where the valance band maximum VBM shuttles holes to the electrolyte at an accelerated rate. The synergistic effect of the passivation layer significantly enhances the rate of charge separation, which is also observed in photoelectrocatalytic degradation of tetracycline hydrochloride with Sn-Fe2O3/NFO25, compared with the pristine Sn-Fe2O3 photoanodes. The work puts forward a new strategy by incorporating ternary ALD systems to develop photoanodes that are effective in both water splitting and wastewater treatment technologies.									12	0	0	0	0	0	12			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000693417600006

Sensing of oxidizing and reducing gases by sensors prepared using nanoscale Co3O4 powders: A study through Cu substitution								ADVANCED POWDER TECHNOLOGY				33	4					103529	10.1016/j.apt.2022.103529				APR 2022	2022	We demonstrate the sensing-mechanism of both oxidising and reducing gases by nanoscale Co3O4 powders through a strategy of Cu-doping in Co3O4. The sensitivity towards both types of gases arises due to presence of Co2+ and Co3+ cations in the (nearly) normal spinel structure of Co3O4. Pellets made up of nanopowders were employed for the detection of -6.5 ppm CO gas present in either pure N2 or in a mixture of synthetic air as carrier gas (which represents the O2 sensing-gas too). The high sensitivity of Co3O4 nanoparticles to detect -6 ppm CO (in N2) arises due to the high surface area of nanopowders exposing a higher number of octahedral Co3+ cations as adsorption sites, whereas the sensitivity towards O2 arises due to partial presence (less number) of octahedral Co2+. To support this mechanism, octahedrally Cu2+ substituted Co3O4 specimens are investigated. The inactive Cu2+ at the octahedral site changes the unexposed tetrahedral Co2+ into Co3+. The presence of inactive Cu2+ at the octahedral site and the burial of the Co3+ at the tetrahedral sites reduce the adsorption sites for O2, thereby drastically reducing the overall O2-gas sensitivity shown by the Cu-substituted sample, although they have higher surface-area (nanoparticles).

Durability tests under steady-state and load-thermal cycles are compared to evaluate the efficiency losses under specific operating conditions. Ac-impedance spectra and post-operation analyses are carried out to investigate the degradation mechanism. Catalyst degradation occurs more rapidly under cycled operation whereas mass transfer issues are relevant especially under steady-state mode. Membrane thinning appears to be affected by the uptime hours at high current density. The overall cell voltage increase is slightly larger for the cycled operation compared to the steady-state mode. However, this is essentially related to a compensation effect associated to a larger decrease of series resistance during the steady-state durability test. The dynamic electrolysis mode at high current density does not exacerbate significantly the degradation issues of low catalyst loading MEAs compared to a steady-state operation. This confirms the proper dynamic characteristics of the polymer electrolyte membrane electrolyser.									17	1	0	0	0	0	18			0378-7753	1873-2755		WOS:000543021900026

Many previous decades-old mTM-Pourbaix diagrams are inconsistent with various direct electrochemical observations, because experimental complexities associated with extracting reliable free energies of formation (Delta (f)G) lead to inaccuracies in the data used for modeling. Here, we develop a high-throughput simulation approach based on density-functional theory (DFT), which quickly screens structures and compounds using efficient DFT methods and calculates accurate Delta (f)G values, using high-level exchange-correlation functions to obtain ab initio Pourbaix diagrams in comprehensive and close agreement with various important electrochemical, geological, and biomagnetic observations reported over the last few decades. We also analyze the microscopic mechanisms governing the chemical trends among the Delta (f)G values and Pourbaix diagrams to further understand the electrochemical behaviors of mTM-based materials. Last, we provide probability profiles at variable electrode potential and solution pH to show quantitatively the likely coexistence of multiple-phase areas and diffuse phase boundaries.									18	1	0	0	0	0	18				2397-2106		WOS:000607634300001

Further, the porous CNT sponge can be easily compacted via an intense densification of the active material MoSe2 to produce an electrode with a high mass loading for a significantly improved areal capacity. In this work, we present a tunable coating of MoSe2 on a CNT sponge to fabricate a core-shell MoSe2@CNT anode. The three-dimensional nanotubular sponge is synthesized via a solvothermal process, followed by thermal annealing to improve crystallization. Structural and morphological studies revealed that MoSe2 grew as a layered structure (d = 0.66 nm), where numbers of layers can be controlled to yield optimized results for Li+ storage. We showed that the 10-layer core-shell CNT@MoSe2 hybrid sponge delivered a discharge capacity of 820.5 mAh g(-1) after 100 cycles at 100 mA g(-1) with a high cyclic stability and rate capability. Further, an ex situ structural and morphological analysis revealed that ionic storage causes a phase change in MoSe2 from a crystalline to a partial amorphous state for a continuous increase in the capacity with extended cycling. We believe that the strategy developed here will assist users to tune the electrode materials for future energy-storage devices, especially how the materials are changing with the passage of time and their effects on the device performance.									65	5	0	0	2	0	64			1944-8244			WOS:000431723400042	29652482

Electrolysis tests are performed with an in-house designed high pressure electrolyzer cell at differential pressure up to 30 bar. The best performance is obtained for an ionomer content of 11.6 wt% and a cell voltage of 1.57 V at 1 A cm(-2) and less than 2 V at 6 A cm(-2) (ambient pressure, 80 degrees C). Performance losses at lower ionomer contents are the result of a higher proton conduction resistance. For higher ionomer contents, on the other hand, performance losses can be related to a filling of the electrode void volume by ionomer, leading to a higher O-2 mass transport resistance, an increased electronic contact resistance, and the electronic insulation of parts of the catalyst by ionomer. At high pressure operation, the performance corrected by the shift of the Nernst voltage increases with H-2 pressure and we propose a new explanation for this effect. (C) The Author(s) 2016.

Kinetic modelling of non-equilibrium air plasma generated by energetic photon and electron beam								2016 IEEE International Conference on Plasma Science (ICOPS)								1 pp.	1 pp.		10.1109/PLASMA.2016.7534196				2016	2016	Summary form only given. The general context of this research work is about the study of electromagnetic perturbations on electronic devices due to an X-ray flash and the air plasma-induced electromagnetic field. The latter needs a good knowledge of the main processes responsible of the formation, the recombination and the relaxation of the non-equilibrium air plasma generated by energetic photons and electrons. A 0D chemical kinetic model has been developed to analyze temporal evolution of an air plasma generated by an initial energetic X-ray flash having a sin4 (t) profile with a mean energy of 1 MeV and a maximum at 50 ns. The kinetic model considers 19 selected influent species (electrons, positive and negative ions, metastables and neutral atoms or molecules) reacting following 126 reactions. The initial gas at atmospheric pressure and ambient temperature contains 80% of N2 and 20% of O2 without and with humidity. The X-ray flash generates relativistic (higher energy) and non-relativistic (lower energy) Compton electrons producing secondary electrons by ionizing the gas. The source terms of these secondary electrons causing the plasma formation, are taken into account in the conservation equations of electron density and electron energy density. The coupling of these two equations, give at each time step the mean secondary electron energy. Such new formalisms of source terms, allow to study the air plasma generation and relaxation without using the complex Monte Carlo method. The results show that the secondary electrons generated by the primary relativistic Compton electron are mainly responsible of the plasma formation. The non-relativistic Compton electrons directly ejected by the gas molecules contribute to less than 10% on the increase of electron density. Until about 65 ns, the population of ejected electrons during ionization processes of O2 and N2 due to impacts of relativistic Compton electrons, compensate the loss of electron due to attachment processes. The electron density grows and reaches a maximum of about 5.4times1012 cm-3. The plasma obtained is weakly ionized with a mean electron energy of 2 eV and a density of main charged species (O-, O2-, O2+ and O4+) between 1012 and 1013 cm-3. Then, after 65 ns the electron density decreases until about 2times109 cm-3, due to the three body attachment processes and the electron recombination with O4+ ions. 200 ns after the X-ray flash application, the electrons are quasi-thermalized, while ionic and neutral species are stabilized by recombination processes on longer timescales. The effect of humidity is also discussed on the plasma characteristics.					2016 IEEE International Conference on Plasma Science (ICOPS)2016 IEEE International Conference on Plasma Science (ICOPS)	19-23 June 201619-23 June 2016		Banff, AB, CanadaBanff, AB, Canada	0	0	0		0	0	0					978-1-4673-9601-1	INSPEC:16225713

SEM and TEM results show that Cu@Cu2O plate-like nanoparticles with tens of nanometers in size are confined inside TiO2 NTAs. Only the outmost several nanometers of the nanoparticles are Cu2O and the predominant inner of the nanoparticles are Cu metals. Cu L3VV Auger spectra of Cu2O/Cu/TiO2 NTAs suggest that Cu metals are enveloped by at least several nanometers Cu2O on the surface, which further confirms the Cu@Cu2O core shell structure of Cu nanoparticles. The ability of light absorption of Cu2O/Cu/TiO2 NTAs is enhanced. The range of absorption wavelengths changes from 400 to 700 nm due to the surface plasmon response of Cu metals core and Cu2O nanoparticles shell. The photocatalytic hydrogen production rate of Cu2O/Cu/TiO2 heterojunction arrays is enhanced when compared with those of Cu2O/TiO2 NTAs and TiO2 NTAs under UV light. Moreover, a stable H-2 generation property was obtained under visible light (lambda gt; 400 nrn). The Cu metal core is believed to play a key role in the enhancement of photocatalytic properties of Cu2O/Cu/TiO2 nanotube heterojunction arrays. Copyright (C) 2012, Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC.

J	HANSON, RB; SORENSEN, SS; BARTON, MD; FISKE, RS								LONG-TERM EVOLUTION OF FLUID ROCK INTERACTIONS IN MAGMATIC ARCS - EVIDENCE FROM THE RITTER RANGE PENDANT, SIERRA-NEVADA, CALIFORNIA, AND NUMERICAL MODELING								JOURNAL OF PETROLOGY				34	1			23	62		10.1093/petrology/34.1.23				FEB 1993	1993	A record of > 100 million years of fluid flow, alteration, and metamorphism in the evolving Sierra Nevada magmatic arc is preserved in metavolcanic rocks of the Ritter Range pendant and surrounding granitoids. The metavolcanic rocks consist of. (1) a lower section of mostly marine volcaniclastic rocks, lavas, and intercalated carbonate rocks that is Triassic to Jurassic in age, and (2) an upper section comprising a subaerial caldera-fill complex of mid-Cretaceous age. Late Cretaceous high-temperature contact metamorphism (approximately 2 kbar, > 450-500-degrees-C) occurred after renewed normal faulting along the caldera-bounding fault system juxtaposed the two sections.The style and degree of alteration and deltaO-18 values differ among the rocks of the upper and lower sections and the granitoids. Rocks of the lower section show pervasive lithologically controlled alkali alteration, local Mn and Mg enrichment, and oxidation. Some ash flow tuffs now contain up to 10% K2O by weight. The rocks of the upper section show lesser extents of alkali alteration. Granitoids that cut both sections are generally unaltered. Most metavolcanic rocks of the lower section have high deltaO-18 values (+ 11 to + 16 parts per thousand; whole rock and quartz phenocrysts), however, lower-section rocks within the caldera-bounding fault system have low deltaO-18 values of + 4 to + 7 parts per thousand. The metavolcanic rocks of the upper section also have low deltaO-18 values of + 2 to + 7 parts per thousand. Granitoids have deltaO-18 values of + 7 to + 10 parts per thousand, typical of unaltered Sierran granitoids. The lower section contains discontinuous veins of high-temperature (450-500-degrees-C) calc-silicate minerals. These veins are typically < 5 m long, do not cross intrusive contacts, and postdate the pervasive alkali alteration. Late veins are typically > 10 m long, formed at temperatures of less than 450-500-degrees-C, and cross intrusive contacts. Veins have similar deltaO-18 values to those of the local host rocks.The nature of the alteration and the high oxygen isotopic values of the rocks of the lower section indicate that these rocks interacted extensively with seawater at temperatures < 300-degrees-C, probably in superposed marine hydrothermal systems associated with coeval volcanic centers. Metavolcanic rocks of the upper section evidently interacted with meteoric waters, probably in a hydrothermal system associated with the Cretaceous caldera; rocks of the lower section that were adjacent to the caldera were also affected by this alteration. The preservation of the signatures of these earlier events, the nature of the early veins, and results from numerical models of hydrothermal flow that include fluid production indicate that during prograde contact metamorphism, the rocks of the pendant primarily interacted with locally derived fluids. Fluid flow was predominantly upward and away from intrusive contacts and down-temperature. Permeabilities are estimated to have been between 0.1 and 1 muD, which is that necessary for maintenance of lithostatic fluid pressures. In hydrothermal models with such permeabilities, large-scale circulation of meteoric fluids develops after prograde metamorphism ceases. The nature of the late veins in the Ritter Range pendant suggests that such a flow pattern evolved only after the pendant and granitoids had cooled below 450-500-degrees-C. The long-term history of alteration documented in the Ritter Range pendant is probably typical of wall rocks in most batholiths.									39	0	0	0	0	0	39			0022-3530			WOS:A1993KU09500002

However, they are also of fundamental significance as a model system for the study of solid-liquid interfaces, which requires combining concepts from the chemistry and physics of crystalline materials and liquids. Particularly interesting is the fact that the water-water and water-metal interactions are of similar strength so that the structures at water/metal interfaces result from a competition between these comparable interactions. Because water is a polar molecule and water and metal surfaces are both polarizable, explicit consideration of the electronic degrees of freedom at water/metal interfaces is mandatory. In principle, ab initio molecular dynamics simulations are thus the method of choice to model water/metal interfaces, but they are computationally still rather demanding. Here, ab initio simulations of water/metal interfaces will be reviewed, starting from static systems such as the adsorption of single water molecules, water clusters, and icelike layers, followed by the properties of liquid water layers at metal surfaces. Technical issues such as the appropriate first-principles description of the water-water and water-metal interactions will be discussed, and electrochemical aspects will be addressed.

Complex 2+ presents a dynamic behavior in the solution that involves the synchronous coordination and the decoordination of the dangling phosphonic groups of the tPa(4-) ligand. However, at oxidation state IV, complex 2(+) becomes seven coordinated with the two phosphonic groups now bonded to the metal center. Further, at this oxidation state at neutral and basic pH, the Ru complex undergoes the coordination of an exogenous OH- group from the solvent that leads to an intramolecular aromatic O atom insertion into the CH bond of one of the pyridyl groups, forming the corresponding phenoxo-phosphonate Ru complex [Ru-III(tPaO-kappa-(NOPOC)-O-2)(py)(2)](2-), 4(2-), where tPaO(5-) is the 3-(hydroxo-[2,':6 ',2 ''-terpyridine]-6,6 ''-diyl)bis(phosphonate) ligand. This new in situ generated Ru complex, 4(2-), has been isolated and spectroscopically and electrochemically characterized. In addition, a crystal structure has been also obtained using single-crystal X-ray diffraction techniques. Complex 42- turns out to be an exceptional water oxidation catalyst achieving record maximum turnover frequencies (TOFmax) on the order of 16 000 s(-1). A mechanistic analysis complemented with DFT calculations has also been carried out, showing the critical role of intramolecular second coordination sphere effects exerted by the phosphonate groups in lowering the activation energy at the rate-determining step.									39	2	0	0	3	0	39			0002-7863	1520-5126		WOS:000526392600019	32045521

The TESS satellite was launched in 2018 to perform high-precision photometry from space over almost the whole sky in a search for exoplanets orbiting bright stars. This instrument has opened new opportunities to study variable hot subdwarfs, white dwarfs, and related compact objects. Targets of interest include white dwarf and hot subdwarf pulsators, both carrying high potential for asteroseismology. Aims. We present the discovery and detailed asteroseismic analysis of a new g-mode hot B subdwarf (sdB) pulsator, EC 21494-7018 (TIC 278659026), monitored in TESS first sector using 120-s cadence. Methods. The TESS light curve was analyzed with standard prewhitening techniques, followed by forward modeling using our latest generation of sdB models developed for asteroseismic investigations. By simultaneously best-matching all the observed frequencies with those computed from models, we identified the pulsation modes detected and, more importantly, we determined the global parameters and structural configuration of the star. Results. The light curve analysis reveals that EC 21494-7018 is a sdB pulsator counting up to 20 frequencies associated with independent g-modes. The seismic analysis singles out an optimal model solution in full agreement with independent measurements provided by spectroscopy (atmospheric parameters derived from model atmospheres) and astrometry (distance evaluated from Gaia DR2 trigonometric parallax). Several key parameters of the star are derived. Its mass (0.391 +/- 0.009x2006;M-circle dot) is significantly lower than the typical mass of sdB stars and suggests that its progenitor has not undergone the He-core flash; therefore this progenitor could originate from a massive (greater than or similar to 2;M-circle dot) red giant, which is an alternative channel for the formation of sdBs. Other derived parameters include the H-rich envelope mass (0.0037 +/- 0.0010;M-circle dot), radius (0.1694 +/- 0.0081;R-circle dot), and luminosity (8.2 +/- 1.1;L-circle dot). The optimal model fit has a double-layered He+H composition profile, which we interpret as an incomplete but ongoing process of gravitational settling of helium at the bottom of a thick H-rich envelope. Moreover, the derived properties of the core indicate that EC 21494-7018 has burnt similar to 43% (in mass) of its central helium and possesses a relatively large mixed core (M-core;=;0.198 +/- 0.010;M-circle dot), in line with trends already uncovered from other g-mode sdB pulsators analyzed with asteroseismology. Finally, we obtain for the first time an estimate of the amount of oxygen (in mass; X(O)(core) = 0.16(-0.05)(+0.13)X(O)core=0.16-0.05+0.13$ X(\mathrm{O})_{\mathrm{core}}=0.16_{-0.05}<^>{+0.13} $) produced at this stage of evolution by an helium-burning core. This result, along with the core-size estimate, is an interesting constraint that may help to narrow down the still uncertain C-12(alpha,;gamma)O-16 nuclear reaction rate.									15	0	0	0	0	0	15			0004-6361	1432-0746		WOS:000501349600006

Unsupported and carbon-supported nanocatalysts were synthesized using the "water-in-oil" microemulsion method. X-ray diffraction (XRD) was used to examine their average crystallite size, which was 2.3 nm in both cases. The shape, size, and size distribution of the nanoparticles were evaluated using transmission electron microscopy (TEM); they were determined to be spherelike with an average size of 3.3 and 3.2 nm for PtNi-NPs and PtCo-NPs, respectively, and a narrow size distribution. Comparison of the XRD and TEM data indicated that the nanocatalysts were polycrystalline in nature. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) measurements were carried out to evaluate the metal loadings of the carbon-supported nanocatalysts, which were 38.1 wt % for PtNi-NPs and 40.8 wt % for PtCo-NPs. Static Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations were performed to analyze the structures and energetics of the PtNi and PtCo systems; it was found that the presence of Ni and Co introduced ca. 8% of volume reduction, as compared to the volume of pure, bulk Pt. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurements at potential scan rates of 5.0 and 50.0 mV s(-1) in 0.50 M aqueous H2SO4 indicated that the specific surface areas (A(s)) of the PtNi-NPs and PtCo-NPs were 74.5 m(2) g(pt)(-1) and 33.1 m(2) g(pt)(-1), respectively. In situ confocal Raman spectroscopy was successfully used to monitor the formation and reduction of surface oxide layers in the submonolayer and monolayer ranges. Corrosion of the nanocatalysts was studied using anodic and cathodic potentiodynamic polarization (PDP) measurements at a very low potential scan rate of s = 0.10 mV s(-1) in 0.50 M aqueous H2SO4 saturated with different gases (N-2(g), O-2(g), or H-2(g)). The nature of the dissolved gas had a profound impact on the corrosion characteristics of the nanoparticles. The nanocatalysts were stable in the electrolyte saturated with H-2(g) and underwent slight corrosion in the electrolyte saturated with N-2(g) and significant corrosion in the electrolyte saturated with O-2(g). The carbon support was also observed to undergo corrosion and porosity changes. The degradation of the nanocatalysts was more pronounced in the case of the anodic PDP measurements than the cathodic ones. Cyclic voltammetry was employed to analyze the loss of A(s) of the nanocatalysts as a result of PDP measurements, and the results were found to corroborate the corrosion data. Evolution of the value of A, of the nanocatalysts in 0.50 M aqueous H2SO4 outgassed using N-2(g) was examined by recording 500 CV transients in the 0.05 V <= E <= 1.45 V range at s = 50.0 my s(-1). It was found that in both cases this treatment resulted in a 50% reduction in A(s).									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			2574-0962			WOS:000502688800010

Different tools were used to explore the morphologies, structures, chemical compositions and optical characteristics of the samples. The effect of initial particle size on the characteristics and photoelectrochemical performance of RW samples generated hydrothermally was investigated. As the starting particle size of ball-milled natural RW rises, the crystallite size of hydrothermally formed samples drops from 70.1 to 31.7 nm. Starting with larger ball-milled particle sizes, the nanoparticles consolidate and seamlessly combine to form a continuous surface with scattered spherical nanopores. Water splitting was used to generate photoelectrochemical hydrogen using the samples as photocatalysts. The number of hydrogen moles and conversion efficiencies were determined using amperometry and voltammetry experiments. When the monochromatic wavelength of light was increased from 307 to 460 nm for the manufactured RW>0.3 photocatalyst, the photocurrent density values decreased from 0.25 to 0.20 mA/mg. At 307 nm and +1 V, the value of the incoming photon-to-current efficiency was similar to 9.77%. Due to the stimulation of the H+ ion rate under the temperature impact, the J(ph) value increased by a factor of 5 when the temperature rose from 40 to 75 degrees C. As a result of this research, for the first time, a low-cost photoelectrochemical catalytic material is highlighted for effective hydrogen production from water splitting.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1				2079-4991		WOS:000823887200001	35808005

These are electrochemically active materials in their pristine form and have also been utilized to derive various metallic nanostructures such as metal oxides, metal phosphides, metal sulfides, metal borides and carbon encapsulated metals/metal alloys, etc. for electrochemical applications. In recent years, the PB/PBAs and their derivatives have attracted significant interests as novel electrochemical materials for energy storage and conversion applications. Here, we briefly describe the structures of PB/PBAs and their derivatives followed by a comprehensive review on recent studies of their use in electrochemical energy storage (metal-ion batteries, supercapacitors) and conversion (metal-air batteries and water electrolyzers) devices. We not only discuss tuning of their internal chemistry but also compare device performance data among different studies and try to establish correlations between material properties with device performances. Last, we discuss critical challenges in this research area and propose three general areas for future research, followed by several specific research directions for different potential energy storage and conversion devices. We hope this review stimulate more studies to realize efficient energy storage and conversion applications of PA/PBAs and their derived nanostructures.									109	5	0	0	5	0	111			2405-8297			WOS:000508681700051

N-terminated GaN nanostructures have emerged as a practical protective layer for conventional high efficiency but unstable Si and III-V photoelectrodes due to their near-perfect conduction band-alignment, which enables efficient extraction of photo-generated electrons, and N-terminated surfaces, which protects against chemical and photo-corrosion. Here, we demonstrate that Pt-decorated GaN nanostructures on an n(+)-p Si photocathode can exhibit an ultrahigh stability of 3000 h (i.e., over 500 days for usable sunlight similar to 5.5 h per day) at a large photocurrent density (>35 mA cm(-2)) in three-electrode configuration under AM 1.5G one-sun illumination. The measured applied bias photon-to-current efficiency of 11.9%, with an excellent onset potential of similar to 0.56 V vs. RHE, is one of the highest values reported for a Si photocathode under AM 1.5G one-sun illumination. This study provides a paradigm shift for the design and development of semiconductor photoelectrodes for PEC water splitting: stability is no longer limited by the light absorber, but rather by co-catalyst particles.									13	0	0	0	1	0	13			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000502302300041

The ability to fine-tune the structures of hydrogels and the prospects of building various microcosms within a large framework are a few of the many characteristics which make hydrogels quite superior in the list of materials developed so far for various applications. This review introduces the strategies of synthesising various types of carbon-based hydrogels and the various mechanisms and ideas which were instrumental in their formation. It also critically brings out the important concepts, latest developments and perspectives associated with the use of hydrogels for recent energy applications. Based on the most recent papers and the most impactful findings, we have described the synthesis of carbon-based hydrogels by broadly dividing them into three categories: graphene-based hydrogels, polymer-based hydrogels and biomass-derived hydrogels. Among these, hydrogels which are conductive in nature are predominantly used in the field of energy applications like supercapacitors, lithium batteries, metal-air batteries, fuel cells and water electrolysers. The flexibility in using sustainable materials and the ability to incorporate tailor-made, non-toxic, cheap, electrochemically active functional moieties during their synthesis make them the frontrunners in the field of green chemistry and energy applications.									76	2	0	0	5	0	76			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000474271200002

In this work, spatially separated Au and Pt nanolayers are firstly deposited on the bottom and surface of Cu2O nanogranules, respectively. The resulting novel Au/Cu2O/Pt photoelectrodes comprise a plasmonic photosensitizer (Au) for intensively increasing light harvesting and generating hot electrons from the surface plasmon resonance (SPR) effect and an electron collector layer (Pt) for promoting photoinduced electron transfer. This synergy effect has been well supported by many photoelectrochemical measurements, especially surface photovoltage (SPV) measurements. As expected, the photocurrent density-voltage curves demonstrate that the Au/Cu2O/Pt composites reach a photocurrent density of -3.55 mA cm(-2), which is almost 4.63 times higher than that of pure Cu2O at 0 V vs. RHE. Moreover, this work provides a promising method for the development of high performance photoelectrodes by the integration of cocatalysts and semiconductors.									115	4	0	0	7	0	115			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000448412700053

However, the planar electrodes based on BBNO thin films show low photocurrent densities for water oxidation owing to their poor electrical conductivity. Here, it is reported that the photoelectrochemical (PEC) activity of BBNO-based electrodes can be dramatically enhanced by coating thin BBNO layers on tungsten oxide (WO3) nanosheets to solve the poor conductivity issue while maintaining strong light absorption. The PEC activity of BBNO/WO3 nanosheet photoanodes can be further enhanced by applying Co0.8Mn0.2Ox nanoparticles as a co-catalyst. A photocurrent density of 6.02 mA cm(-2) at 1.23 V (vs reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE)) is obtained using three optically stacked, but electrically parallel, BBNO/WO3 nanosheet photoanodes. The BBNO/WO3 nanosheet photoanodes also exhibit excellent stability in a high-pH alkaline solution; the photoanodes demonstrate negligible photocurrent density decay while under continuous PEC operation for more than 7 h. This work suggests a viable approach to improve the PEC performance of BBNO absorber-based devices.									53	3	0	0	0	0	53			1614-6832	1614-6840		WOS:000429535300001

The 23-kDa protein of PSII was resistant to the proteinase when in its native form but became susceptible upon modification by p-chloromercuriphenylsulfonic acid (pCMPS), upon incubation at pH 3, and upon incubation in dilute SDS. Conformational changes caused by pCMPS seemed to be restricted to a localized region since the modified protein reconstituted the water-oxidizing complex with slightly less efficiency as compared with the untreated protein. Under the three proteolytic conditions, cleavage occurred at the Asn-58-Leu-59 bond, suggesting that the protein underwent similar conformational changes in each case. Dithiothreitol, dialysis at pH 7, and neutral detergents suppressed the facilitative effects of pCMPS, pH 3, and SDS on proteolysis, respectively. With the reversible changes in susceptibility, reversible changes in circular dichroism of the protein also occurred at 200-208 nm. These observations indicate that the conformational changes are reversible and the renaturation of the substrate was associated with the suppression of the susceptibility. These results suggest that the scissile bond becomes reversibly exposed and susceptible to the proteinase in response to environmental changes.									18	1	0	0	14	0	18			0032-0781	1471-9053		WOS:A1995QV86600015	7757339

The films show enhanced photocurrent density of 0.37 mA/cm(2) at 1.23 V vs. a reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) under 20-50 degrees C heating-cooling cycles and illumination, which is 3.1 and 1.6 times higher than that of PREC (0.09 mA/ cm(2)) and PEC catalysis (0.14 mA/cm(2)). It is found that the higher catalysis efficiency can be the result of increased carrier concentration, including photogenerated carriers and pyro-generated carriers, and accelerated charge separation and transfer due to the change in band alignment at NaNbO3/electrolyte caused by the imbalance of polarization charges and the induced pyroelectric potential. This study confirms the feasibility of pyroelectric-assisted PEC performance and realizes the energy harvesting of cold-hot alternation thermal energy and solar energy. It also provides insights into the rational design for designing new and ecofriendly photo-electrodes with efficient PEC water splitting.									54	3	0	0	2	0	55			2211-2855	2211-3282		WOS:000653012100009

However, despite decades of research, advances at laboratory scale in terms of catalyst design and insights into underlying processes have not resulted in urgently needed improvements in water electrolyser performance or higher deployment rates. In light of recent developments in water electrolyser devices with modified architectures and designs integrating concepts from Li-ion or redox flow batteries, we discuss practical challenges hampering the scaling-up and large-scale deployment of water electrolysers. We highlight the role of device architectures and designs, and how engineering concepts deserve to be integrated into fundamental research to accelerate synergies between materials science and engineering, and also to achieve industry-scale deployment. New devices require benchmarking and assessment in terms of not only their performance metrics, but also their scalability and deployment potential.Although low-temperature water electrolysers are crucial for decarbonizing the industrial sector, substantial improvements in performance and deployment rates are needed. Recent developments in devices with modified architectures and designs, and practical challenges hampering large-scale deployment are discussed.									120	8	0	0	6	0	123			1476-1122	1476-4660		WOS:000575344200005	33020614

The mesoporous TiO2 electrode with a short-range order of mesopores, the surface area of 200 m(2) g(-1), the average pore size of 2.7 nm, and semi-crystalline anatase walls is prepared by using a surfactant self-assembly template followed by a two-step calcination process. The electrochemical behaviour of the hydroxide ion solution at the lsm-TiO2 electrode is studied, and a novel and well-defined oxidation peak around the potential of 0.85 V (vs. SCE) is revealed. The oxidation process is irreversible, under diffusion control, and the peak current linearly increases with [OH-] within the concentration range 1.0-50 mM. The hydroxide ion detection limit of 0.05 mM is achieved, based on 3s calculations, along with an extraordinary current sensitivity of 0.180 mA mM(-1). This hydroxide oxidation process can be performed in nitrate, fluoride, chloride, or sulfate-containing supporting electrolytes, which makes the lsm-TiO2 electrode very selective for the voltammetric hydroxide ion determination.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			1572-6657	1873-2569		WOS:000554922000013		
J	Jo, Won Jun; Katsoukis, Georgios; Frei, Heinz								Ultrathin Amorphous Silica Membrane Enhances Proton Transfer across Solid-to-Solid Interfaces of Stacked Metal Oxide Nanolayers while Blocking Oxygen								ADVANCED FUNCTIONAL MATERIALS				30	12					1909262	10.1002/adfm.201909262		FEB 2020		MAR 2020	2020	A large jump of proton transfer rates across solid-to-solid interfaces by inserting an ultrathin amorphous silica layer into stacked metal oxide nanolayers is discovered using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and Fourier-transform infrared reflection absorption spectroscopy (FT-IRRAS). The triple stacked nanolayers of Co3O4, SiO2, and TiO2 prepared by atomic layer deposition (ALD) enable a proton flux of 2400 +/- 60 s(-1) nm(-2) (pH 4, room temperature), while a single TiO2 (5 nm) layer exhibits a threefold lower flux of 830 s(-1) nm(-2). Based on FT-IRRAS measurements, this remarkable enhancement is proposed to originate from the sandwiched silica layer forming interfacial SiOTi and SiOCo linkages to TiO2 and Co3O4 nanolayers, respectively, with the O bridges providing fast H+ hopping pathways across the solid-to-solid interfaces. Together with the complete O-2 impermeability of a 2 nm ALD-grown SiO2 layer, the high flux for proton transport across multi-stack metal oxide layers opens up the integration of incompatible catalytic environments to form functional nanoscale assemblies such as artificial photosystems for CO2 reduction by H2O.									14	0	0	0	1	0	14			1616-301X	1616-3028		WOS:000511234000001

So we tried to combine MoS2 with hydrotalcite to improve the morphology and enhance the performance of MoS2. The XRD, XPS, UV-vis prove that the material obtained is molybdenum disulfide intercalated zinc-aluminum hydrotalcite, and the SEM shows the particle size of molybdenum disulfide is reduced due to the interlaminar structure of hydrotalcite. Then, in the experiment of degrading methylene blue, the effects of cation ratio, thiourea dosage, pH and catalyst dosage on degradation were investigated. After 30 min of adsorption and 150 min of illumination, the maximum degradation rate of methylene blue can reach 93 %. And by analyzing the photocatalytic effect of the physical mixing of the two materials, it can be concluded that the photocatalytic performance of the composite material is better than that of the physical mixing of the two materials, which is close to 60 %. Therefore, composite with hydrotalcite enhances photocatalytic performance of MoS2, so the composite of MoS2/LDH has great potential in the field of photocatalytic degradation.<bold> </bold>									18	1	0	0	6	0	19			0927-7757	1873-4359		WOS:000504350600002

In a first step, three individual metals (Pt, Pd and Ag) were sequentially sputter-deposited on spaced TiO2 nanotubes, followed by a thermal dewetting treatment in Ar to convert these metal layers into ternary PtPdAg alloyed particles. Dealloying was carried out by a selective chemical dissolution of Ag in piranha solution that finally generated porous alloyed nanoparticles located on the TiO2 nanotube walls. The porous PtPdAg-decorated TiO2 nanotubes show enhanced photocatalytic H-2 generation in comparison with porous Pt (67% increase) or any monometallic decoration (>120% increase). The photocatalytic enhancement is not only due to the increased number of active sites (larger surface area) of the porous particles but also due to the synergistic effects of the different alloying elements.

However, systematic studies on the growth mechanism and related photocatalytic activities involving different valent metal ions (either M2+ or N3+) as foreign cations and monoclinic Cu1.94S NCs as the 'parent lattice' have rarely been carried out. In this work, we report an effective seed-mediated method for the synthesis of heterostructured Cu1.94S-MS NCs (M = Zn, Cd and Mn) and alloyed CuNS2 NCs (N = In and Ga). A typical cation exchange process took place prior to the growth of heterostructured NCs, while further inter-cation diffusion occurred only for the alloyed NCs. When compared with Cu1.94S NCs, all the heterostructured Cu1.94S-MS NCs and CuGaS2 NCs showed enhanced photocatalytic activities toward hydrogen production by water splitting, owing to their tailored optical band gaps and energy level alignments. Although optically favored, CuInS2 ANCs were not comparable to others due to their low conduction band minimum for the reduction of H2O to H-2.									14	3	0	0	0	0	14			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000520487300036	32129398

Unfortunately, by using conventional synthetic methodology, it is a great challenge to realize the monodisperse composition/structure of metal nanoparticles at the atomic level, and to establish correlations between the catalytic properties and the structure of individual catalyst particles. For the study of well-defined nanocatalysts, great advances have been made for the successful synthesis of nanoparticles with atomic precision, notably ligand-passivated metal nanoclusters. Such well-defined metal nanoclusters have become a type of model catalyst and have shown great potential in catalysis research. In this review, the authors summarize the advances in the utilization of atomically precise metal nanoclusters for electrocatalysis. In particular, the factors (e.g., size, metal doping/alloying, ligand engineering, support materials as well as charge state of clusters) affecting selectivity and activity of catalysts are highlighted. The authors aim to provide insightful guidelines for the rational design of electrocatalysts with high performance and perspectives on potential challenges and opportunities in this emerging field.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			1613-6810	1613-6829		WOS:000779925000001	35403353

We demonstrate that the depolarizing ability and lifetime of bis-3-sulfopropyl-disulfide (SPS), a typical brightener in the copper electroplating bath, are strongly affected by the oxidative activity of the anode. Here, the commercially available IrO2-based and Ta2O5-based dimensionally stable anodes (DSA) are employed in the Cu plating, and the oxidation rate of SPS during the deposition is analyzed. The results reveal the prolonged depolarizing ability and lifetime of SPS in the plating bath when the relatively inert anode, Ta2O5-DSA, is used. The degradation rate of brighteners can be quantified by the voltammetric stripping method and consequently, the variation in the brighteners activity during electrodeposition can be precisely tracked to ensure their functions. Moreover, the inert anode is highly recommended to prolong the function and lifetime of SPS, which is cost-effective and beneficial for circumventing the bath aging issue.

In this review, we have systematically summarized the preparation of g-C3N4-based composites, including physical adsorption, hydrothermal growth, thermal vapor condensation and the newly-developed precursor wrapping method according to recent researches. The advantages of g-C3N4-based core-shell composites including their physicochemical properties, stability, optical and electronic properties are highlighted. Various applications are addressed, such as photo-catalytic hydrogen production from water splitting, photo-catalytic degradation of organic pollutants, photo-catalytic reduction of carbon dioxide, and photo-electric anti-corrosion. Various strategies for designing and constructing highly effective g-C3N4-based core-shell composites are also thoroughly proposed, including band-gap and lattice match, optimization of the preparation method of nanocomposites and nanocore characteristics.

The photocatalytic reaction in Na2S solution indicated that the as-synthesized composite presented excellent performance in water splitting under simulated sunlight and visible light. A thorough investigation was performed to reveal the origin of the high performance. X-ray diffraction (XRD), Raman, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), Scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) experiments proved that CdS nanopartilces were uniformly dispersed on the surface of KTN naocubes. UV-visible diffuse reflection spectroscopy (DRS) analysis indicated that the addition of CdS improved the ability to absorb visible light. N-2-adsorption analysis showed that the difference in surface area of the CdS/KTN composites was very small. Photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), and transient photocurrent response (PC) analyses suggested that the added CdS greatly elevated the charge separation efficiency, which was considered as the key character of the composite. On the basis of the characterization results and the band structure of the two semiconductors, it is deduced that the CdS/KTN composite works according to a type-Il mechanism under simulated sunlight. The optimal sample demonstrated a H-2-generation rate of 1252 mu mol.g(-l).h(-1), which is 260 and 48 times higher than that of KTN and CdS, respectively. Under visible light, photosensitization mechanism works in the composite. The synergetic effect of CdS and KTN in H-2 production was also observed. Meanwhile, the composite also presented high photocatalytic stability. Considering the high activity and stability, the CdS/KTN may have potential application in photocatalytic H-2 generation.

Ti-CNF reinforced epoxy resin composite coatings with different filler contents are prepared by mixing the two nanomaterials in equal amounts based on the obstructing effect of carbon nanofibers(CNF)of different lengths on the diffusion path of seawater, as well as the phenonmen that the protective effect of titanium nanoparticles(Ti)can form a dense oxide film by rapid passivation with oxygen at room temperature, and the volume expansion of titanium nanoparticles during their own oxidation can achieve the filling effect of microcracks in the composite coating. The evolution of functional groups in pure resin and Ti-CNF reinforced epoxy resin composites are analyzed with employing the infrared spectroscopy. The hardness, adhesion, fracture toughness, tribological characteristics and corrosion resistance of some kinds of epoxy resin composite coatings reinforced with variant Ti-CNF contents are evaluated by experiments. The fracture, wear and corrosion mechanisms of composite coatings are revealed using scanning electron microscopy. The bonding of Ti-CNF hybrid filler with the resin matrix is a process of physical reaction. Pure resin composites have great brittleness. And the hardness, adhesion, fracture toughness, friction coefficient and wear rate at this point can respectively reach 374HL, 3.5 MPa, 0.738 MPa·m~(1/2), 0.487 and 12.23*10~(-13) m~3/(N·m). After immersion test with acid and alkali resistant solution, the composite coating appears obvious peeling and cracking. With the increase of Ti-CNF nanohybrid filler content, the hardness, adhesion, fracture toughness, friction wear and acid and alkali solution impregnation resistance of the composites showed a trend of increasing and then decreasing. The hardness, adhesion, fracture toughness and friction wear properties of the composites are substantially improved when the filler additionsare 2wt.% and 4wt.% compared to the pure resin. However, obvious bubbles and pitting are still observed on the surface of the composite coating after the acid and alkali resistant solution impregnation test. The bonding mode between Ti-CNF mixed filler and resin matrix is physical bonding. The optimum effects of reinforcement for composite can be obtained when the additive filler is 6wt.%. And the hardness, adhesion, fracture toughness, friction coefficient and wear rate at this point can respectively reach 668HL, 5.8 MPa, 0.937 MPa·m~(1/2), 0.354 and 7.52*10~(-13) m~3/(N·m). No obvious rust spots are observed after immersion test in acid and alkali resistant solutionAlso, the rust spots are unconspicuously observed after seawater dipping corrosion test. However, the performance of the composite coating gradually decreases with the additive filler increased to 8wt.%. And the hardness, adhesion, fracture toughness, friction coefficient and wear rate at this point can respectively reach 643HL, 4.4 MPa, 0.84 MPa·m~(1/2), 0.427 and 8.86*10~(-13) m~3/(N·m). Also, the rust spots are obviously observed by the seawater dipping corrosion test.			目的提高海水轴向柱塞泵摩擦副的耐磨和耐蚀性能,以钛纳米颗粒(Ti)和碳纳米纤维(CNF)为原料,设计并制备Ti-CNF增强环氧树脂复合涂层。方法借助红外光谱仪分析纯树脂和Ti-CNF增强环氧树脂复合材料中官能团的变化,通过硬度、附着力、断裂韧度、摩擦磨损和耐酸碱溶液浸渍测试,分别评价不同含量的Ti-CNF增强环氧树脂复合涂层的硬度、附着力、断裂韧度、摩擦学性能和耐腐蚀性能,并利用扫描电子显微镜揭示复合涂层的断裂、磨损和腐蚀机理。结果Ti-CNF混合填料与树脂基体的结合方式为物理黏合;当添加填料的质量分数为6%时,复合材料的增强效果最佳,硬度、附着力、断裂韧度、摩擦因数和磨损率分别为668HL、5.8 MPa、0.937 MPa·m~(1/2)、0.354、7.52*10~(-13) m~3/(N·m),耐酸碱溶液浸渍测试后未观察到明显的锈点。当添加填料的质量分数增加到8%时,复合涂层的性能逐渐下降,耐酸碱溶液浸渍测试后观察到明显的锈点。结论添加适量的Ti-CNF混合填料能够有效提高环氧树脂的硬度、断裂韧度、摩擦学性能和耐酸碱溶液腐蚀性能;Ti纳米颗粒与氧气产生化学反应,有效抑制了微裂纹的持续扩展;CNF填料由于尺寸上的差异,限制了周围树脂基体的运动,延长了酸碱溶液在树脂中的扩散路径,2种填料相互作用,在很大程度上提高了复合涂层的性能。						0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1001-3660			CSCD:7191333

In this study, a series of BaNbO2N particles doped with various cations were synthesized to improve the photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting performance of porous BaNbO2N photoanodes via donor density control in the semiconductor bulk. Doping lower-valent cations (Ti4+, Zr4+) into Nb5+ sites decreased the donor density, as indicated by the Mott-Schottky plots, and also suppressed the generation of Nb4+ species to some extent. In contrast, doping with higher-valent cations (W6+, Mo6+) increased the donor density and accelerated Nb4+ generation. The porous photoanodes of BaNbO2N doped with lower-valent cations showed a larger photocurrent density than that of the undoped photoanodes, whereas those fabricated with higher-valent cations exhibited smaller values over the entire applied potential range. The optimized Ti4+-doped BaNbO2N photoanodes exhibited superior performance compared to their tantalum counterparts, demonstrating PEC water splitting with a relatively high quantum efficiency under visible light after appropriate loading of a cocatalyst. These results strongly suggest that the donor density of undoped BaNbO2N was excessively high because of the inevitable reduction of Nb5+ during the nitridation process, and the appropriate reduction of donor density by lower-valent cation doping can provide both a suitable electron conductivity and a sufficient hole diffusion length, thus substantially improving the performance.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			2398-4902			WOS:000716019700001

However, as a cold-sensitive crop originating from the tropics, the growth and development of tomato is often affected by low temperature stress. Therefore, how processing tomatoes resist this type of stress has important theoretical and practical significance. In this study, the LeCOLD1 gene was cloned from processing tomato. Subcellular localization analysis showed that LeCOLD1 was located in the plasma membrane. Real-time quantitative PCR analysis showed that LeCOLD1 was highly expressed in roots. Drought, salt and low temperatures induced the expression of COLD1. Overexpression and RNA interference vectors of LeCOLD1 were constructed and were transformed into tomato by the Agrobacterium-mediated method, and then obtaining transgenic tomato plants. It was found that LeCOLD1 increased the height of processing tomato plants and increased the length of their roots. In addition, overexpression of LeCOLD1 significantly improved the cold resistance of the plants. Overexpressing LeCOLD1 in tomato plants reduced the damage to the cell membrane, accumulation of ROS and photoinhibition of PSII, and maintained the high activity of antioxidant enzymes and the content of osmotic regulators. Further analysis revealed that during low temperature stress, the cells maintained high levels of antioxidant enzyme activity by regulating the transcription of the genes encoding these enzymes. The results show that overexpressing LeCOLD1 in tomato increases the plants' resistance to low temperatures, and that reducing LeCOLD1 expression makes the plants more sensitive to low temperatures.									3	0	0	0	1	0	3			0981-9428	1873-2690		WOS:000531096600004	32193092

Despite these important considerations, the main focus of this review is concerned with the major difficulties found in trying to interpret the electrochemical findings obtained for porous electrodes in the presence and absence of a pseudocapacitance (e.g., Faradaic process) due to presence of distributed and dispersion capacitance effects. In this sense, we present a comprehensive analysis concerned with the misuse of the classic electrochemical methods initially proposed for the study of ideally flat and/or spherical electrodes that are commonly adapted to evaluate the specific capacitance exhibited by porous electrodes. We critically discussed the main pitfalls arising from the incorrect interpretation of the electrochemical findings obtained in the time and frequency domains using different electrochemical characterization methods.

Ocean wave energy is an abundant and relatively stable source of renewable energy, which would be highly desirable for the conversion of CO2 to conveniently stored and transported liquid fuels. In this work, we demonstrate a wave-energy-driven electrochemical CO2 reduction system, consisting of triboelectric nanogenerators, a supercapacitor and a CO2 reduction reactor, that converts ocean wave energy to chemical energy in the form of formic acid, a liquid fuel. We optimize the energy storage component of the system and operation voltage of the electrochemical cell to achieve efficient energy storage and maximize the production of formic acid. Under simulated waves, the system can produce 2.798 mu mol of formic acid per day via the wave energy harvested from a water surface area of 0.04 m(2). Moreover, we have performed field tests in the Red Sea to demonstrate the practicality of such an electrochemical CO2 reduction system. Finally, we present design guidelines for achieving a cost-effective, efficient, and large-scale wave-energy-driven CO2 reduction system for liquid fuel production.									64	4	0	0	4	0	65			1754-5692	1754-5706		WOS:000536818900013

Importance of Octahedral Distortion and Cooperative Effects								ACS OMEGA				4	2			2989	2999		10.1021/acsomega.8b03350				FEB 2019	2019	Understanding metal oxide MO2 (M = Ti, Ru, and Ir)-water interfaces is essential to assess the catalytic behavior of these materials. The present study analyzes the H2O-MO2 interactions at the most abundant (110) and (011) surfaces, at two different water coverages: isolated water molecules and full monolayer, by means of Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof-D2 static calculations and ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations. Results indicate that adsorption preferably occurs in its molecular form on (110)-TiO2 and in its dissociative form on (110)-RuO2 and (110)-IrO2. The opposite trend is observed at the (011) facet. This different behavior is related to the kind of octahedral distortion observed in the bulk of these materials (tetragonal elongation for TiO2 and tetragonal compression for RuO2 and IrO2) and to the different nature of the vacant sites created, axial on (110) and equatorial on (011). For the monolayer, additional effects such as cooperative H-bond interactions and cooperative adsorption come into play in determining the degree of deprotonation. For TiO2, AIMD indicates that the water monolayer is fully undissociated at both (110) and (011) surfaces, whereas for RuO2, water monolayer exhibits a 50% dissociation, the formation of H3O2- motifs being essential. Finally, on (110)-IrO2, the main monolayer configuration is the fully dissociated one, whereas on (011)-IrO2, it exhibits a degree of dissociation that ranges between 50 and 75%. Overall, the present study shows that the degree of water dissociation results from a delicate balance between the H2O-MO2 intrinsic interaction and cooperative hydrogen bonding and adsorption effects.									21	0	0	0	0	0	21			2470-1343			WOS:000460237300057	31459524

At the first pulse stage, a compact Sb-SnO2-coating TiO2-NTs interlayer was realized; at the second, various morphologies of apparent layers including flower-like, hierarchical, and dendritic morphologies were realized through regulating pulse parameters. Morphology-dependent electrode activities were investigated. Electrochemical experiment results show that dendritic-morphology electrode has the lowest charge transfer impedance (27.5 Omega vs. 43.2, 38.1, and 37.5 Omega) in comparison with other electrodes, and chronopotentiometry tests show a higher accelerated service lifetime of dendritic electrode (23 h vs. 17.8, 17.4, and 13.9 h), indicating the optimal electrochemical activity. The electrocatalytic methyl orange decolorization processes show that dendritic electrode possesses a higher first-order kinetics rate constant than other two electrodes (51.7 x 10(-3) min(-1) vs. 32.5 x 10(-3), 39.7 x 10(-3), and 35.5 x 10(-3) min(-1)). These results demonstrate that the dendritic electrode possesses the most efficient catalytic performance.									7	0	0	0	3	0	7			1432-8488	1433-0768		WOS:000431668000023

We find that the work function of these bimetallic surfaces is significantly different from that of parent metals. Careful analysis based on Bader charges and electron density difference indicates that the variation of the work function in bimetallic surfaces can be mainly attributed to two factors: (1) charge transfer between the two different metals as a result of their different intrinsic electronegativity, and (2) the charge redistribution induced by chemical bonding between the top two layers. The first factor can be related to the contact potential, i.e., the work function difference between two metals in direct contact, and the second factor can be well characterized by the change in the charge spilling out into vacuum. We also find that the variation in the work functions of Pd/M/Pd(111) surfaces correlates very well with the variation of the d-band center of the surface Pd atom. The findings in this work can be used to provide general guidelines to design new bimetallic surfaces with desired electronic properties.

Ryb, Uri/0000-0002-6439-9618; Lloyd, Max/0000-0001-9367-2698			Experimental calibration of clumped isotope reordering in dolomite								GEOCHIMICA ET COSMOCHIMICA ACTA				242				1	20		10.1016/j.gca.2018.08.036				DEC 1 2018	2018	Dolomite clumped isotope compositions are indispensable for determining the temperatures and fluid sources of dolomitizing environments, but can be misleading if they have modified since formation. Carbonate Delta(47) values are susceptible to resetting by recrystallization during diagenesis, and, even in the absence of dissolution and reprecipitation reactions, alteration by solid-state reordering during prolonged residences at elevated temperatures. In order to understand the potential of dolomite Delta(47) values to preserve the conditions of dolomitization in ancient sections, the kinetic parameters of solid-state reordering in this phase must be determined. We heated mm-sized crystals of near-stoichiometric dolomite in a Rene-type cold seal apparatus at temperatures between 409 and 717 degrees C for 0.1-450 h. In order to prevent the decarbonation of dolomite to calcite, periclase, and CO2 at these conditions, the system was pressurized with CO2 to 0.45-0.8 kbar. Over the course of 31 temperature-time points and 128 individual Delta(47) measurements of powdered dolomite crystals from these points, we observed the evolution of dolomite Delta(47) values from the initial (unheated) composition of the crystals (0.452 +/- 0.004 parts per thousand, corresponding to a formation temperature of similar to 145 degrees C) towards high-temperature equilibrium distributions. Complete re-equilibration occurred in the 563-717 degrees C experiments. As with previous heating experiments using calcite and apatite, dolomite Delta(47) exhibited complex reordering behavior inadequately described by first-order Arrhenian-style models. Instead, we fit the data using two published models for clumped isotope reordering: the transient defect/equilibrium defect model of Henkes et al. (2014), and the exchange-diffusion model of stolper and Eiler (2015). For both models, we found optimal reordering parameters by using global least-squares minimization algorithms and estimated uncertainties on these fits with a Monte Carlo scheme that resampled individual Delta(47) measurements and re-fit the dataset of these new mean values. Because the exact Delta(47) -T relationship between 250 and 800 degrees C is uncertain, we repeated these fitting exercises using three published high-temperature Delta(47)-T calibrations. Regardless of calibration choice, dolomite Delta(47) rate constants determined using both models are resolvably slower than those of calcite and apatite, and predict that high-grade dolomite crystals should preserve apparent equilibrium blocking temperatures of between similar to 210 and 300 degrees C during cooling on geologic timescales.Best agreement between model predictions and natural dolomite marbles was found when using the exchange-diffusion model and the ab initio Delta(63)-T calibration of Schauble et al. (2006), projected into the Delta(47) reference frame by Bonifacie et al. (2017). Therefore, we recommend modeling dolomite Delta(47) reordering using the exchange-diffusion model and this parameter set. In simple heating scenarios, the two models disagree. The transient defect/equilibrium defect model suggests that dolomite fabrics resist detectable reordering at ambient temperatures as high as 180 degrees C for tens of millions of years, while the exchange-diffusion model predicts incipient partial reordering perhaps as low as 150 degrees C. In either case, barring later recrystallization, dolomite Delta(47) values should be faithful recorders of the conditions of dolomitization in sedimentary sections buried no hotter than similar to 150 degrees C for tens of millions of years.

But a transition towards lower noble metal catalyst loadings and intermittent operation is needed for the widespread utilization of this technology. Although kinetic losses tend to dominate in membrane electrode assembly (MEA) results, it has been suggested that morphological changes and interfaces between the catalyst, ionomer, and membrane will also contribute to overall degradation. Moreover, the combination of degradation to the catalyst layer (CL) constituents will further lead to structural changes that have not been widely explored. The multitude and complexity of degradation mechanisms, which likely occur simultaneously, require a characterization approach that can explore surfaces and interfaces at a range of length-scales to probe chemical, morphological, and structural changes of constituents within the catalyst later. This paper presents a comprehensive characterization approach that features scanning electron microscopy (SEM), scanning transmission electron microscopy with energy-dispersive X-Ray spectroscopy (STEM/EDS), X-Ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), X-Ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS), and transmission X-Ray microscopy (TXM) with X-Ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) chemical mapping to study degradation of the catalyst layer with a focus on MEAs after intermittent and steady-state operation. Catalyst changes including dissolution, oxidation, and agglomeration were observed, as well as redistribution and dissociation of the ionomer. These smaller-scale changes were found to have a large influence on overall stability of the electrodes: they caused the formation of voids and segregation of constituents within regions of the film. Delamination and collapse of the overall catalyst layer were observed in some instances. Greater changes were observed after an extended 2 V hold compared to IV cycling, but similar degradation mechanisms were detected, which suggests the larger issues would likely also be experienced during intermittent PEMWE operation. These findings would not be possible without such a systematic, multi-scale, multi-technique characterization approach, which highlights the critical importance of detailed analysis of catalyst layer degradation to propose mitigation strategies and improve long-term PEM water electrolyzer performance.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0013-4651	1945-7111		WOS:000804951100001

Over the past years, the integration of metal sulfides with electrospun nanomaterials has emerged as an exciting research topic owing to the synergistic effects between the two components, leading to novel and interesting properties in energy, optics and catalysis research fields for example. In this review, we focus on the recent development of the preparation of electrospun nanomaterials integrated with functional metal sulfides with distinct nanostructures. These functional materials have been prepared via two efficient strategies, namely direct electrospinning and post-synthesis modification of electrospun nanomaterials. In this review, we systematically present the chemical and physical properties of the electrospun nanomaterials integrated with metal sulfides and their application in electronic and optoelectronic devices, sensing, catalysis, energy conversion and storage, thermal shielding, adsorption and separation, and biomedical technology. Additionally, challenges and further research opportunities in the preparation and application of these novel functional materials are also discussed.									12	0	0	0	0	0	12			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000651534500001	34008677

These materials were prepared under acidic or basic conditions, using either nitric acid or ammonium hydroxide as the catalyst. A design-of-experiments approach was used in order to optimize the specific surface area, pore structure, and thermal stability of the prepared samples. It was observed that the addition of ceria and zirconia did not affect the formation of gamma-Al2O3. The highest surface areas and smallest pore sizes were observed for specimens obtained under acidic conditions and with low to intermediate concentrations of cerium and water. The increase of the heat treatment temperature from 600 degrees C to 1000 degrees C led to both a decrease of the surface area and an increase of the mean pore size. This behavior is due to the coalescence of pores upon calcination. Samples with a high concentration of ceria showed an expressive thermal instability at high temperatures. On the other hand, the addition of zirconia increased the thermal stability of these materials. In general, samples with improved thermal stabilities were obtained under basic conditions.

For comparison, Er3+:Y3Al5O12, Pt-TiO2 and Er3+:Y3Al5O12/Pt-TiO2 are all characterized by X-ray diffractometer (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX). At first, the up-conversion luminescence properties of Er3+:Y3Al5O12 are reviewed by excitation spectrum in visible-light region and emission spectrum in ultraviolet-light region. And then, under visible-light irradiation the visible-light photocatalytic activity of Er3+:Y3Al5O12/Pt-TiO2 is examined through photocatalytic hydrogen production from aqueous methanol solution. Lastly, the influence factors such as Er3+:Y3Al5O12 and Pt-TiO2 mole ratio, heat-treated temperature and heat-treated time on the visible-light photocatalytic hydrogen production activity of Er3+:Y3Al5O12/Pt-TiO2 are studied. Particularly. Er3+:Y3Al5O12/Pt-TiO2 with 6:100 M ratio heat-treated at 550 degrees C for 90 min shows the highest photocatalytic activity in hydrogen production from aqueous methanol solution.

The effective temperatures are based on the infrared flux method with improved E(B - V) values obtained mostly from interstellar NaID lines. The Li abundances were derived through MARCS models and high-quality UVES+VLT, HIRES+Keck and FIES+NOT spectra, and complemented with reliable equivalent widths from the literature. The less-depleted stars with [Fe/H] < -2.5 and [Fe/H] > -2.5 fall into two well-defined plateaus of A(Li) = 2.18 (sigma = 0.04) and A(Li) = 2.27 (sigma = 0.05), respectively. We show that the two plateaus are flat, unlike previous claims for a steep monotonic decrease in Li abundances with decreasing metallicities. At all metallicities we uncover a fine-structure in the Li abundances of Spite plateau stars, which we trace to Li depletion that depends on both metallicity and mass. Models including atomic diffusion and turbulent mixing seem to reproduce the observed Li depletion assuming a primordial Li abundance A(Li) = 2.64, which agrees well with current predictions (A(Li) = 2.72) from standard Big Bang nucleosynthesis. Adopting the Kurucz overshooting model atmospheres increases the Li abundance by +0.08 dex to A(Li) = 2.72, which perfectly agrees with BBN+WMAP.									110	1	0	0	0	0	111			1432-0746			WOS:000280505000005

Plant genomes contain multiple homologs of the GSK3 genes which participate in various biological processes. Plant GSKs/SKs, and their best known representative in Arabidopsis thaliana - Brassinosteroid Insentisive2 (BIN2/SK21) in particular, were first identified as components of the brassinosteroid (BR) signaling pathway. As phytohormones, BRs regulate a wide range of physiological processes in plants - from germination, cell division, elongation and differentiation to leaf senescence, and response to environmental stresses. The GSKs/SKs proteins belong to a group of several highly conserved components of the BR signaling which evolved early during evolution of this molecular relay. However, recent reports indicated that the GSKs/SKs proteins are also implicated in signaling pathways of other phytohormones and stress-response processes. As a consequence, the GSKs/SKs proteins became hubs of various signaling pathways and modulators of plant development and reproduction. Thus, it is very important to understand molecular mechanisms regulating activity of the GSKs/SKs proteins, but also to get insights into role of the GSKs/SKs proteins in modulation of stability and activity of various substrate proteins which participate in the numerous signaling pathways. Although elucidation of these aspects is still in progress, this review presents a comprehensive and detailed description of these processes and their implications for regulation of development, stress response, and reproduction of model and crop species. The GSKs/SKs proteins and their activity are modulated through phosphorylation and de-phosphorylation reactions which are regulated by various proteins. Importantly, both phosphorylations and de-phosphorylations may have positive and negative effects on the activity of the GSKs/SKs proteins. Additionally, the activity of the GSKs/SKs proteins is positively regulated by reactive oxygen species, whereas it is negatively regulated through ubiquitylation, deacetylation, and nitric oxide-mediated nitrosylation. On the other hand, the GSKs/SKs proteins interact with proteins representing various signaling pathways, and on the basis of the complicated network of interactions the GSKs/SKs proteins differentially regulate various physiological, developmental, stress response, and yield-related processes.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1664-462X			WOS:000841668100001	35909730

Several types of tube microfossils were recognized, including siboglinids, polychaetes and calcerous serpulids, replaced by a variety of minerals (e.g. hematite-quartz, hematite-chlorite, carbonate-hematite) depending on the nature of the substrate prior to the formation of the gossanites. Colonial hematite tube microfossils (similar to 150 mu m across,1-2 mm long) are composed of hematitic outer and inner walls, and may exhibit a cellular structure within their cavities. Spherical forms are saturated with Fe-oxidizing bacteria inside the tubes - probably analogues of trophosomes. Colloform stromatolitic outer wall surfaces are characterized by the presence of numerous interlaced filaments of hematite (2-3 mu m diameter, up to 1-2 mm long). Between tube microfossils, the hematitized cement contains bundles of hematitized filaments with structures similar to the hyphae of fungi. Hematite-chlorite tube microfossils are scattered in gossanites, mostly as biological debris. They are typically 30 to 300 pm in diameter and 1 to 5 mm long. The layered structure of their tube walls is characterized by hematite-quartz and chlorite layers. Abundant filamentous bacteria coated by glycocalix and chlorite stromatolite are associated with hematite-chlorite tubes. The carbonate-hematite tube microfossils (up to 300 pm across, 2-3 mm long) occur in carbonate-rich gossanites. The tubes are characterized by fine (similar to 10 pm thick) walls of hematite and cavities dominated by relatively dark carbonate or hematite. Carbonates may be present both in walls and cavities. Stromatolite-like leucoxene or hematite-carbonate aggregates were also found in association with tubes. Randomly oriented filaments are composed of ankerite. Single filaments are composed of individual cells, typically smaller than 100 nm across, similar to that of magnetotactic bacteria.Three dimensional tomographic images of all types of tube microfossils demonstrate a clear wavy microlayering from outer and inner walls, which may reflect segmentation of the tube worms. The traces of burrowing, or fragments of glycocalix with relict spheres are typical of tube microfossils from gossanites. The carbon isotopic composition of carbonates associated with tube microfossils from hematite-quartz, hematite-carbonate, and hematite-chlorite gossanites average -7.2, -6.8, -22.8 parts per thousand, PDB, respectively. These values are indicative of a biogenic origin for the carbonates. The oxygen isotopic composition of these carbonates is similar in all three gossanite types averaging +13.5, +14.2, +13.0 parts per thousand (relative to SMOW), and indicative of active sulfate reduction during the diagenetic (and anadiagenetic) stages of the sediments evolution. The trace element characteristics of hematite from tube microfossils are characterized by high contents of following trace elements (average, ppm): Mn (1529), As (714), V (540), W (537), Mo (35), and U (5). Such high contents are most likely the result of metal and metalloid sorption by fine particles of precursor iron hydroxides during the oxidation of sulfides and decomposition of hyaloclasts via microbially-mediated reactions.

This approach permits identifying presolar grains down to < 100 nm in size, compared to > 150 nm in lower-resolution (nominal 100 nm) ion imaging surveys. The number density of identified presolar grains is a about a factor of two to three higher than what was found by lower-resolution ion imaging studies. The abundances of grains of O isotope Group 3 and 4 are higher than previously found. None of the presolar grains shows the strong enrichments in O-16 expected from model predictions for the majority of supernova (SN) grains. Other potential O-rich SN grains, the Group 4 and some of the Group 3 grains, make up 33% by number and 19% by mass. This is clearly higher than the similar to 10% (by number) inferred before and the 5% (by mass) estimated by a model for stellar dust in the interstellar medium. Our work shows that O-rich SN grains might be more abundant among the population of presolar grains in primitive solar system materials than currently thought, even without the O-16-rich grains as predominantly expected from SN models.									25	0	0	0	1	0	25			2041-8205	2041-8213		WOS:000358778900009

Therefore, improving the combination of heterogeneous materials will become a new attempt. In this work, a novel lattice embedded ZnO@TiO2(B) nanoflowers was prepared by combining electrodeposition method combined & nbsp;with hot solvent method. The hetero interface of the ZnO@TiO2(B) nanoflowers is distributed in the phase of TiO2(B), which drives high-efficiency charge separation. The sample Zn:Ti 1:4 has the highest photocatalytic property, and the H2 generation efficiency under the full spectrum is 1.695 mmol g-1 h-1, which is 3.5 times that of TiO2(B). After 36 h cycle stability test, its stability is as high as 90%. According to results, the possible mechanism of ZnO@TiO2(B) photocatalytic hydrogen production is proposed. These findings may provide new strategies for the preparation of high-efficiency heterojunction photocatalysts with special structures. (c) 2022 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC.

Owing to the highly tunable composition and uniform distribution of metal cations in the brucite-like layers, as well as the facile exchangeability of intercalated anions, LDHs can be modified and functionalized to form various nanostructures/composites through versatile processes such as anion intercalation and exfoliation, decoration of nanoparticles, self-assembly with other two-dimensional (2D) materials, and controlled growth on conductive supports (e.g., nanowire arrays, nanotubes, 3D foams). In this article, we briefly review the recent advances on both the LDH nanostructures and functionalized composites toward the applications in energy conversion, especially for water oxidation.

Unfortunately, no two nanoparticles from conventional synthesis are the same at the atomic level, though such regular nanoparticles can be highly uniform at the nanometer level (e.g., size distribution similar to 5%). In the long pursuit of well-defined nanocatalysts, a recent success is the synthesis of atomically precise metal nanoclusters protected by ligands in the size range from tens to hundreds of metal atoms (equivalently 1-3 nm in core diameter). More importantly, such nanoclusters have been crystallographically characterized, just like the protein structures in enzyme catalysis. Such atomically precise metal nanoclusters merge the features of well-defined homogeneous catalysts (e.g., ligand-protected metal centers) and enzymes (e.g., protein-encapsulated metal clusters of a few atoms bridged by ligands). The well-defined nanoclusters with their total structures available constitute a new class of model catalysts and hold great promise in fundamental catalysis research, including the atomically precise size dependent activity, control of catalytic selectivity by metal structure and surface ligands, structure-property relationships at the atomic-level, insights into molecular activation and catalytic mechanisms, and the identification of active sites on nanocatalysts. This Review summarizes the progress in the utilization of atomically precise metal nanoclusters for catalysis. These nanocluster-based model catalysts have enabled heterogeneous catalysis research at the single-atom and single-electron levels. Future efforts are expected to achieve more exciting progress in fundamental understanding of the catalytic mechanisms, the tailoring of active sites at the atomic level, and the design of new catalysts with high selectivity and activity under mild conditions.									167	4	0	0	7	0	167			0009-2665	1520-6890		WOS:000613131500002	32941029

Their relationship with tocochromanols, whose critical role in maintaining seed viability has already been evidenced, and with chlorophylls, whose retention in mature seed is thought to have negative effects on storability, remain also unexplored. Here, we aimed at elucidating seed carotenoids relationship with tocochromanols and chlorophylls with regard to phylogenetic and ecological traits and at understanding their changes during germination. The composition and distribution of carotenoids were investigated in seeds of a wide range of wild species across the Fabaceae (the second-most economically important family after the Poaceae). Photosynthetic pigments and tocochromanols were analyzed by HPLC in mature dry seeds of 50 species representative of 5 subfamilies within the Fabaceae (including taxa that represent all continents, biomes and life forms within the family) and at key timepoints during seedling establishment in three species representative of distinct clades. Total-carotenoids content positively correlated with tocopherols in the basal subfamilies Detarioideae, Cercidoideae, and Dialioideae, and with chlorophylls in the Papilionoideae. Papilionoideae lacked tocotrienols and had the highest total-carotenoids, chlorophyll and gamma-tocopherol contents. Interestingly, lutein epoxide was present in 72% of the species including several herbs from different subfamilies. Overall, species original from temperate biomes presented higher carotenoids and lower tocochromanols levels than those from tropical biomes. Also shrub species showed higher carotenoids content than herbs and trees. During germination, total content of photosynthetic pigments increased in parallel to changes in relative abundance of carotenoids: zeaxanthin and anteraxanthin decreased and beta-carotene augmented. Notably, the highest contents of nutritionally valuable carotenoids were found in Papilionoideae subfamily to which all pulses of socio-economic importance belong. The major differences in carotenoids and tocochromanols composition across the Fabaceae are apparently related to phylogeny in conjunction with ecological traits such as biome and growth form.									16	0	0	0	9	1	16			1664-462X			WOS:000408373900001	28883825

In this study, the effects of different anode catalyst materials on the performance of PEMWE are investigated. In line with this aim the temperature, membrane thickness, current collector length and molar fraction distribution of species in gas channels are investigated to observe and compare the effects of different anode catalyst. The cell performance is simulated with a two dimensional numerical model based on Comsol Multiphysics Software. The performance of the cell and hydrogen production are increased with the change of temperature from 303 K to 353 K. Different thickness of the membrane is investigated and the results bring out that use of thinner membrane is more important for Pt-Ir anode catalyst than Pt anode catalyst. Additionally, Pt-Ir anode catalyst is decreased cell voltage and provided four times higher current density. Maximum value of hydrogen molar fraction in the cathode gas channel isincreased60%.									15	2	0	0	0	0	16			1615-6846	1615-6854		WOS:000395007000005

In this work, multi-walled carbon nanotube (MWCNT)/CdS-diethylenetriamine (DETA) composite photocatalyst was synthesized via hydrothermal method. The structure, morphology, optical property and core level analysis of MWCNT/CdS-DETA nanocomposite were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM), energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy spectra (EDS), UV-Vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS) and X-ray photoelectron spectrum (XPS). CdS-DETA can be uniformly dispersed on the surface of MWCNT. Photocatalytic properties of as-prepared photocatalysts were investigated under 410 nm LED light irradiation for photodegradation of methylene bule (MB). The k(app) of MWCNT/CdS-DETA is 0.034 min(-1), which is about 6 times more than pure CdS-DETA. Photostability test indicated that MWCNT/CdS-DETA hybrid can be reused for degradation of organic pollution, suggesting the possible application of MWCNT/CdS-DETA hybrid is the most promising strategy for advanced photocatalyst material design.

J	Bobis, RE; Jaireth, S; Morrison, GW								The anatomy of a carboniferous epithermal ore shoot at Pajingo, Queensland: Setting, zoning, alteration, and fluid conditions								ECONOMIC GEOLOGY AND THE BULLETIN OF THE SOCIETY OF ECONOMIC GEOLOGISTS				90	6			1776	1798		10.2113/gsecongeo.90.6.1776				SEP-OCT 1995	1995	The Paleozoic Scott lode gold-silver epithermal deposit, situated at Pajingo, northeast Queensland, is hosted by feldspathic-volcanolithic sandstones, quartzose sandstones, ignimbrites, andesitic volcanics with interbedded block and ash deposits, lapilli tuffs, and andesitic to dioritic intrusive rocks. The Scott lode deposit contains 1.23 million metric tons of 9.9 g/t gold and 38.9 g/t silver.There are six principal types of alteration assemblages which are zoned with respect to the main vein structure: propylitic, potassic (adularia), intermediate argillic, silicic, kaolinitic, and ferroan carbonate. Overprinting textural relationships indicate that the propylitic type is earliest, progressively followed by potassic (adularia), then intermediate argillic, and finally silicic alteration. Auriferous veins are largely coeval with the silicic and intermediate argillic alteration types. Kaolinite and ferroan carbonate occur as late-stage alteration products, postdating the precious metal mineralization.Principal ore and sulfide minerals include pyrite, sphalerite, galena, chalcopyrite, hessite, tennantite-tetrahedrite, argentite, petzite, electrum, and native gold. Gangue minerals in the veins are quartz, illite, adularia, calcite, and locally, kaolinite. The main-stage quartz is zoned with respect to mineralogy, mineralization styles, metal distribution patterns, and vein textures. Three major zones can be recognized: zone I-an upper precious metal, moss chalcedonic crustiform-colloform quartz zone, zone II-intermediate precious + base metal, crystalline quartz-coarse-grained sulfide-dominated, crustiform-colloform quartz zone, and zone III-deep sparse base metal, weakly banded crystalline comb quartz zone. The ore interval occurs in zones I and II with the transition to zone III effectively defining the limit of mineralization.Economic mineralization at the Scott lode deposit was laid down from dilute fluids (0.7-2.5 wt % NaCl equiv) with a very low concentration of CO2. Homogenization temperatures of 170 degrees to 315 degrees C exhibit vertical variation with higher temperatures at greater depth. The presence of coexisting liquid- and gas-rich inclusions in mineralized quartz, together with adularia, vein brecciation, and pronounced crustiform-colloform banding, indicates hydrothermal boiling as the principal precipitation mechanism for gold and silver deposition. Thermodynamic modeling of adiabatic boiling of a fluid with an initial concentration of 2 to 5 ppb gold at 300 degrees C indicates that such a fluid can deposit ores containing 10 ppm gold and 260 ppm silver at the temperature intervals recorded by the fluid inclusion work. The delta(18)O values of the fluids in equilibrium with the vein quartz, calculated from the quartz delta(18)O values and median homogenization temperatures lie within the range -7.0 to -1.0 per mil.The delta D values of fluid extracted from primary inclusions in quartz range between -59.5 and -64.9 per mil. The compositions of altered rocks show significant depletion in oxygen and deuterium which can be attributed to isotopic reactions with meteoric water. Isotopic calculations indicate that meteoric water of a composition and delta D = -86 per mil alone cannot explain the observed values. It is suggested that the epithermal fluid in Pajingo was the result of mixing between meteoric water and isotopically magmatic water.									23	0	0	0	0	1	24			0361-0128			WOS:A1995TT49700020

Their composites make them appropriate choices for various applications in the medical, energy and industrial sectors. Composite materials are subject of interest in the polymer industry. Different kinds of fillers, such as cellulose-based fillers, carbon black, clay nanomaterials, glass fibers, ceramic nanomaterial, carbon quantum dots, talc and many others have been incorporated into polymers to improve the quality of the final product. These results are dependent on a variety of factors; however, nanoparticle dispersion and distribution are major obstacles to fully using nanocomposites/bio-nanocomposites materials/membranes in various applications.

The CoNi/CoFe2O4/NF electrode prepared with a pulse voltage of -1.2 V by the UPED exhibited the outstanding electrocatalytic activity and durability with the rate of hydrogen production achieved as high as 1.25 +/- 0.0625 m(3)/(m(3) day). The excellent performance of the electrocatalyst is attributed to the unique multilayer layered structure, which consisted of macroscopic porous NF, CoFe2O4 nanosheets, and CoNi double hydroxide nanosheets. The hierarchical architecture is binder-free and beneficial for exposing catalytic active sites, enhancing mass transport, and large specific surface area for MEC hydrogen production. It is expected to the CoNi/CoFe2O4/NF composite electrode application in the practical microbial electrolysis cells to produce hydrogen during the treatment of wastewater.HighlightsA CoNi/CoFe2O4 electrocatalyst was prepared for microbial electrolysis cell.The electrocatalysts had unique multilevel hierarchical architecture.The electrocatalysts exhibited a high H-2 production rate of 1.25 +/- 0.0625 m(3)/(m(3) day).									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0363-907X	1099-114X		WOS:000643579100001

These materials have a wide array of applications owing to their diverse properties: notable instances include catalysis, piezoelectric components, magnetic components, biomedical applications, heterogeneous catalysis and photocatalysis. Given the growing importance of environmentally friendly, low-temperature methodologies to obtain functional materials, there is a growing interest in synthetic approaches which are compatible with the principles of "green chemistry". In this context, wet chemistry represents an attractive choice, and furthermore offers the possibility of scale-up for manufacture of materials in volumes for practical application. Though there is a sizeable amount of literature on the synthesis of ferrites, the most common approaches require treatments at temperatures above 200 degrees C, either as the main synthetic procedure itself (thermal decomposition), or as a post-synthetic step (for example, calcination after sol-gel autocombustion). This review aims at summarising, categorising, classifying and critically discussing the different low-temperature (<200 degrees C), wet chemistry approaches employed in recent years for the synthesis of ferrites.

The as-prepared composites were investigated by various analytical techniques and utilized for adsorption of ciprofloxacin from wastewater and as a catalyst support. The composites consist of the SiOC matrix, silicon dioxide and free carbon. The optimized composite has the hierarchical pores with high specific surface area of 767.61 m(2)/g and pore volume of 0.84 cm(3)/g. The adsorption process of ciprofloxacin onto SiOC composites adheres to the pseudo-second-order kinetic model. The external film diffusion and intra-particle diffusion jointly control the adsorption rate, and the Langmuir and Freundlich models can properly describe the adsorption isotherms. The SiOC samples show a large adsorption capacity (148.0 mg/g) and superior reusability, suggesting its exceptional reusability and potential application in antibiotic-containing wastewater treatment. Furthermore, the photodegradation rate constant of the SiOC/g-C3N4 composite is almost 2.28 times as high as that of pristine g-C3N4, indicating that the SiOC composites can be employed in a favorable catalyst support ascribed to the enhancement of photodegradation performance after loading photocatalyst on the SiOC adsorbent.									13	0	0	0	2	0	13			0927-7757	1873-4359		WOS:000499647200008

FA oxidation proceeds at the unmodified Pt electrode with the appearance of two oxidation peaks at 0.25 and 0.65 V corresponding to the direct oxidation of FA to CO2 and the oxidation of the poisoning intermediate, CO, to CO2 with a current ratio of the two peaks less than 0.2. Interestingly, this ratio jumps up to more than 50, upon modifying Pt with nano-NiOx. This highlights the essential role of NiOx in enhancing the direct oxidation of FA (at 0.25 V) at Pt substrate. On the other hand, unmodified GC and Au anodes as well as those modified with nano-NiOx exhibit no catalytic response toward FA oxidation. This highlights the essential role of the underlying substrate and depicts also that nano-NiOx behaves as a catalytic mediator which facilitates the charge transfer during the oxidation of FA at Pt anode. Optimization of the surface coverage of nano-NiOx at Pt is achieved, aiming at maximizing the rate of the direct oxidation pathway of FA while suppressing the indirect oxidation route producing the poisoning CO. Moreover, nano-NiOx/Pt anode maintains its high catalytic activity for a prolonged time of continuous oxidation of FA. (C) 2012 The Electrochemical Society.

The photocatalytic activity of TiO2/TiC coatings has been significantly enhanced, especially under visible light. The influence of cHT temperature for TiC and Ti coatings on surface morphology, formed compounds, and photocatalytic activity has also been investigated. In general, rutile TiO(2)forms on TiC coatings, whereas TiC(x)O(y)forms on Ti coatings. By raising the cHT temperature for TiC coatings, the surface morphology of TiO2/TiC coatings with a pore-like structure significantly changes from nano-size to micro-size, inevitably resulting in the reduction of the accessible surface area. However, the influence of cHT temperature on the Ti coatings is insignificant, demonstrating a smooth surface morphology. Notably, owing to the increased accessible surface area and formed heterojunction of TiO2/TiC, the photocatalytic activity of TiO2/TiC coatings has been significantly enhanced approximately 6 times especially under visible light, compared with that of TiCxOy/Ti coatings. Furthermore, when the cHT temperature has been raised, the photocatalytic activity of TiO2/TiC coatings initially increases and then decreases, achieving their most satisfaction at 1073 K, which is attributed to the narrowed band gap of TiO(2)owing to the shifted O 1s spectra.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1432-8488	1433-0768		WOS:000577380800001

It was formed along the contact with the Dorojin granitoid massif next to the Zefreh Fault. The plutonic rocks are of I-type, volcanic arc affinity with normal-K, metaluminous, calc-alkaline to calcic quartz diorite, tonalite, and granodiorite, similar to many other Fe-type skarn-related granitoids worldwide. The parent magma involved in this skarn system is high temperature and relatively oxidized. Amphibole geobarometery in quartz diorite yielded a crystallization pressure lower than 200 MPa (2 kb, similar to 7 km) at 724 degrees to 785 degrees C. Granitoid compositions around the ore deposit are mainly granodiorite. U-Pb zircon dating yields Early Miocene ages of 23.0 +/- 1.6 Ma for a quartz dioritic rock and 21.3 +/- 1.5 Ma for a tonalitic sample. The injection and cooling of the granodiorite produced a hornblende hornfels aureole with endoskarn.Paragenetic relationships and microprobe data indicate that Abbas-Abad calcic skarn evolution can be subdivided into three stages as follow: (I) Prograde skarn associated andradite-rich garnet (Adr(93-98)Grs(0-4)Spe(1-2)) and pyroxene, (II) Retrograde skarn starting with garnet (Adr(53-69)Grs(28-43)Spe(2-4)), magnetite, and sulfide minerals associated with calcic-alteration, and (III) Post-ore with pyrite, chalcedony, epidote, quartz, calcite, and zeolite veinlets. Textural and compositional studies of garnet and magnetite from the garnet-bearing exoskarn zone reveal the multiple events associated with skarn formation. Garnets are characterized by low TiO2 and relatively high CaO that are indicative of a calcareous wall-rock among Eocene volcaniclastic rocks. They are grouped into garnet-1 (low w/r) and garnet-2 (inverse zoning at high w/r) with notable Cu-contents (up to 743 ppm). Petrographically, magnetite morphology is divided into fine-grained granular, needle-like, and polycrystalline aggregates. Mineral chemistry of needle-like type reveals impure components (Al2O3, CaO, and SiO2). This type formed from dissolution-reprecipitation processes during a stage of reequilibration in the skarn system. Mixing with cooler external fluid (rich in oxygen and poor in Fe2+) is reflected in individual features during infiltration metasomatism during garnet and magnetite growth, such as oscillatory zoning and needle-like textures. Thus, we infer increasing pH (decreasing acidity) and decreasing T related to carbonate neutralization reactions affecting Fe- and Cu-chloride complexing as the main controls on mineralization.The structural studies of the area show that movement of the dextral transtensional Zefreh Fault provide local zones for emplacement of Dorojin granitoid during the Early Miocene. Consequently, the dextral transtensional Zefreh Fault and dextral transpression associated with the Marbin-Rangan Fault uplifted the skarn and host units and Dorojin body under the roughly N-S directed maximum compression direction. Furthermore, the interplay of Zefreh and Marbin-Rangan faults within the N-S regional compressional regime formed an anticlinal structure that exposed the Dorojin body within the core.									8	0	0	0	0	0	8			0169-1368	1872-7360		WOS:000515206900021

These functional materials, which possess compositional and structural heterogeneity over a wide range of length scales, are usually characterized by classical macroscopic or "bulk" electrochemical techniques that are not well-suited to analyzing the nonuniform fluxes that govern the electrochemical response at complex interfaces. In this Perspective, we highlight new directions to studying fundamental electrochemical and electrocatalytic phenomena, whereby nanoscale-resolved information on activity is related to electrode structure and properties colocated and at a commensurate scale by using complementary high-resolution microscopy techniques. This correlative electrochemical multimicroscopy strategy aims to unambiguously resolve structure and activity by identifying and characterizing the structural features that constitute an active surface, ultimately facilitating the rational design of functional electromaterials. The discussion encompasses high-resolution correlative structure activity investigations at well-defined surfaces such as metal single crystals and layered materials, extended structurally/compositionally heterogeneous surfaces such as polycrystalline metals, and ensemble-type electrodes exemplified by nanoparticles on an electrode support surface. This Perspective provides a roadmap for next generation studies in electrochemistry and electrocatalysis, advocating that complex electrode surfaces and interfaces be broken down and studied as a set of simpler "single entities" (e.g., steps, terraces, defects, crystal facets, grain boundaries, single particles), from which the resulting nanoscale understanding of reactivity can be used to create rational models, underpinned by theory and surface physics, that are self-consistent across broader length scales and time scales.									119	10	0	0	6	1	120			0002-7863			WOS:000459222100001	30485739

The electrochemical and physical characterization of the MEAs was performed by I-V curves, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Even though the total NML was lowered to 0.38 mg cm(-2), it still reached a high performance of 1.633 V at 2 A cm(-2) and 80 degrees C, with IrO2 as anode catalyst. The influences of the ionomer content in the anode catalyst layer (CL) and the cell temperature were investigated with the purpose of optimizing the performance. SEM and EIS measurements revealed that the MEA with low NML has very thin porous cathode and anode CLs that get intimate contact with the electrolyte membrane, which makes a reduced mass transport limitation and lower ohmic resistance of the MEA. A short-term water electrolysis operation at 1 A cm(-2) showed that the MEA has good stability: the cell voltage maintained at similar to 1.60 V without distinct degradation after 122 h operation at 80 degrees C and atmospheric pressure.

One such microorganism is the cellulolytic fungus Trichoderma reesei (Hypocrea jecorina). Using EST analysis and cDNA microarrays, we find that in T. reesei expression of the genes encoding the enzymes of the tricarboxylic acid cycle and the proteins of the electron transport chain is programmed in a way that favors the oxidation of pyruvate via the tricarboxylic acid cycle rather than its reduction to ethanol by fermentation. Moreover, the results indicate that acetaldehyde may be channeled into acetate rather than ethanol, thus preventing the regeneration of NAD(+), a pivotal product required for anaerobic metabolism. The studies also point out that the regulatory machinery controlled by glucose was most probably the target of evolutionary pressure that directed the flow of metabolites into respiratory metabolism rather than fermentation. This finding has significant implications for the development of metabolically engineered cellulolytic microorganisms for fuel production from cellulose biomass.									95	5	0	0	88	0	114				1083-351X		WOS:000175096000083	11825887

To understand the evolution law of properties of NCMs with preparation conditions, eleven NCMs were prepared and charac-terized by EA, BET, Raman, XPS, and conductivity. Surface area and conductivity can be improved by higher pyrolysis temperature and longer retention time. Distribution of nitrogen species of NCMs was greatly influenced by pyrolysis temperature. Subsequently, these NCMs were applied to activate peroxymonosulfate to degrade 2,4-dichlorophenol. A linear correlation of the initial apparent degradation rate constant (kobs) of 2,4-dichlorophenol with conductivity and ratio of graphitic N was newly established, revealing that conductivity and graphitic N of NCMs would be the key property deciding degradation efficiency of 2,4-dichlorophenol. Positive effect of con-ductivity can be ascribed to the mediated electron-transfer mechanism. Electron-transfer mechanism is also proved by quenching experiments and solvent deuterium isotope effect experiment. Graphitic N would be the main active site for PMS activation. Understanding the evolvement rule of properties of NCMs with preparation conditions combined with the correlations between reactivity and properties of NCMs is meaningful for prepa-ration of nitrogen-doped biochar as well as the development of carbonaceous materials with high performance in persulfates-based advanced oxidation processes.									1	0	0	0	1	0	1			0304-3894	1873-3336		WOS:000734391300001	34863564

These impurities dramatically affect the properties of NiOOH and may have been present unknowingly in NiOOH systems throughout the past several decades. A better understanding of this tendency of NiOOH to spontaneously incorporate possible contaminants therefore is of great interest. In this work, we calculated the free energies of adsorption and incorporation of Fe-3(+), Co-3(+), and Mn-4(+) dopants in beta-NiOOH using ab initio thermodynamics. We define the aqueous phase energies for these dopants using both calculated solid phase bulk energies and their corresponding experimental solubilities. We then demonstrate that only a weak driving force exists for adsorption of Fe-3(+) and Co-3(+) complexes on the surface of beta-NiOOH and no tendency at all for the adsorption of Mn-4(+) aquo and hydroxo complexes. We predict a strong thermodynamic driving force for bulk incorporation of Fe-3(+) and Co-3(+), even at trace concentrations (ppb to ppm levels) under ambient and basic aqueous conditions, but no such tendency for Mn-4(+). These results provide a thermodynamic explanation for the scavenging and doping behavior of NiOOH observed experimentally and highlight the importance of careful control of the experimental conditions when studying this material.

The efficiency of PEC system is dependent on the engineering of semiconductors with tailored narrow band gap coupled with superior photoelectrochemical activity and desired stability vital for the commercialization of PEC water splitting cells. We report herein the study of vertically aligned Nb and N doped SnO2 nanotubes (NTs), i.e., (Sn0.95Nb0.05)O-2: N NTs for PEC water splitting. (Sn0.95Nb0.05)O-2 NTs was selected for co-doping with nitrogen by systematic analysis of applied bias photon-to-current efficiency of various Nb doped SnO2 (x=0-0.1) compositions. Consequently, excellent photoelectrochemical stability and the highest efficiency of 4.1% is obtained for (Sn0.95Nb0.05)O-2:N-600 NTs never observed for other known TiO2, ZnO, and Fe2O3 systems to date. Additionally, theoretical first principles study provides understanding of Nb and N co-doping on the electronic structure and band gap of SnO2 semiconductor, further corroborating results of the experimental study.

Three TiO2 samples with different specific surface areas were modified by IrO2 using a modified version of the Adams fusion method. A constant weight ratio of IrO2/TiO2 of 0.6 was maintained in all cases. The size, specific surface area and morphology of IrO2 electrocatalyst crystallites were investigated by X-ray diffraction, nitrogen adsorption (BET) and scanning electron microscopy, respectively. The electron conductivity of compressed catalyst powders was evaluated. Their electrochemical properties were studied on a rotating disk electrode (RIDE) and finally in a laboratory electrolyser. Utilization of the TiO2 support resulted in a reduction in the size of the IrO2 crystallites. It was found that the lower the specific surface area of the supports, the higher was the electrochemical activity of the catalyst. This is most likely due to the formation of a conductive IrO2 film on the surface of non-conductive supports. For the supports with a higher surface area, the amount of IrO2 used was not sufficient to form an adequately compact film. This resulted in high electron resistance of such a catalyst. The RIDE results were confirmed by a laboratory electrolysis test. Taken together with the excellent stability of TiO2 in an anodic environment, these results suggest that these materials are promising supports if the appropriate amount of iridium is deposited.

However, the physical origin of the electrocatalytic performance of the amorphous alloy catalyst is still unclear due to the difficulty of amorphous modelling and the huge cost of DFT calculations. Here, we built a Smooth Overlap of Atomic Positions-Machine Learning (SOAP-ML) model to accelerate the DFT study on the effect of the local atomic environment of the Pd40Ni10Cu30P20 catalyst. Compared to pure DFT-calculated results and experiment, our model makes a good prediction (MSE = 0.018) of the local atomic environment with the best catalysis. We calculated 40 000 active sites on the amorphous alloy surface and obtained the optimal atomic ratio of the alloy catalyst (Pd : Cu : P : Ni = 0.51 : 0.33 : 0.09 : 0.07), indicating that the Pd d electrons mainly enhance the catalytic performance. We employed the SOAP-ML model to reveal the physical origin of the long durability as the dealloying of Ni, which is highly consistent with the experimental results. The above results all prove the high accuracy and reliability of the established SOAP-ML model and provide an appealing idea for the future application of the amorphous alloy.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000749669300001	35106528

However, it remains a challenging task to gain comprehensive understanding on how the local electronic structures of single metal catalytic sites are rationally tuned, which eventually holds the key to significantly enhance the electrocatalytic performance. Herein, we implement B-N bonds into an N-doped 3D graphene framework by B doping to further stabilize the supported catalytic Ni single-sites and simultaneously tune their local electronic structure. Moreover, electrochemical in situ Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy reveals that the B-N bonds can further facilitate the production of pivotal *COOH intermediates in comparison with only N doping. As a result, the Ni single-site catalyst on the B, N co-doped 3D graphene framework achieves excellent catalytic performance with a CO faradaic efficiency (FE) of 98% and a turnover frequency (TOF) value of 20.1 s(-1) at -0.8 V (vs. RHE), whereas the FE and TOF for the control sample without B doping are as low as 62% and 6.0 s(-1), respectively. This work highlights the superiority of modulating local electronic structures of single-site catalysts toward efficient electrocatalytic CO2 reduction.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000738831400001	34985080

The twenty-nine placer nephrite samples collected from both rivers and analyzed in the present study possess fine-grained and compact microstructures. The mineral assemblages in the samples provide clues to the metamorphic/metasomatic processes that formed the nephrite, which was the result of one of the following reactions: dolomitic marble -> tremolite, or dolomitic marble -> diopside -> tremolite. White nephrite from the Yurungkash River and green nephrite from the Karakash River are predominantly tremolite. Based on electron probe microanalytical data, backscattered electron images, and Raman spectra, two kinds of black nephrite from the Karakash River are identified: one dominated by actinolite aggregates, and another consisting of tremolite aggregates with graphite crystals up to 2 mm in length. Compared with black nephrite, white and green nephrites contain fewer mineral inclusions and have lower FeO and MnO contents. All the amphiboles in the nephrites have very low contents of Cr2O3 (0.00-0.07 wt.%) and NiO (0.00-0.05 wt.%) relative to serpentinite-related nephrite (0.07-0.43 wt.% Cr2O3, 0.08-0.36 wt.% NiO). Most of the nephrite samples have low total rare earth element (Sigma REE) contents, ranging from 1222 to 49.40 ppm. In two nephrite samples, relatively high TREE concentrations (161 and 190 ppm) are related to the presence of REE-bearing minerals. Whole-rock REE chondrite-normalized patterns of all samples are characterized by strong negative Eu anomalies (0.16-0.48), moderate light-REE enrichment (La/Nd-N = 1.8-5.0), and nearly flat heavy-REE distributions (Gd/Yb-N = 0.31.7). Nephrite samples from both river locations have delta O-18 and delta D isotope compositions ranging from 1.1%. to 5.6 parts per thousand and -55.7 parts per thousand to -72.4 parts per thousand, respectively. These values are closer to those recorded in dolomite-related nephrites than those in serpentinite-related deposits. Importantly, delta O-18 and delta D values correspond to fluid isotope compositions of delta O-18 = 1.6 parts per thousand to 6.1 parts per thousand (330 degrees C).1.8 parts per thousand to 6.3 parts per thousand (350 degrees C), and 2.5 parts per thousand to 7.0 parts per thousand (430 degrees C), and delta D = -34.9 parts per thousand to -52.5 parts per thousand (350 degrees C to 650 degrees C). These values are close to or within the field of magmatic water. Geochemical and petrographic characteristics point to a dolomite-related metamorphic/metasomatic origin for nephrite at both locations. The placer nephrite is likely to have been derived from primary nephrite deposits in the Kunlun Mountains around Hetian, based on the geological occurrence of the deposits. (C) 2011 Elsevier BM.

Porous nanostructures have been newly reported as a promising class of most effective materials for this purpose because of their unique advantages in terms of large surface-to-volume ratios, surface permeability, and void spaces. These offer abundant active sites for ultimate electrochemical activities by the shortening pathway of mass/charge transport. Particularly, Fe-based mesoporous nanostructures (mp-FeNSs) have been recently fascinating. Iron is a principal active center in nanocomposites and has high industrial suitability for next-generation technology owing to its environment friendliness, abundance, and low cost. In this review, crucial technical advances related to mp-FeNSs that have occurred during 2016-2020 are summarized in terms of synthesis, structural design strategy, and ECS applications such as water electrocatalysis, Li-ion batteries, and supercapacitors. This review is supportive for potential readers to obtain general and professional information in this field since Fe-based energy materials are exclusively introduced in the article including a fundamental understanding of electrochemistry and related technologies in detail.									7	0	0	0	1	0	7				2566-6223		WOS:000598268400001

In the present work, we investigate by means of first principle calculation how the photocatalytic activities of MoS2/CdS(0 0 1) and MoS2/CdS(1 0 0) are the facet dependent. The results reveal that comparing to MoS2/CdS(0 0 1), MoS2/CdS(1 0 0) displays expanded light absorption edge, fast migration velocity and higher visible absorption ability. We trace this surprising result to the generation of type-II heterojunction which lead to the reduction of band gap to 0.335 eV, making it easier for photoelectons to move from CdS to MoS2 monolayer. And, MoS2/CdS(1 0 0) have suitable band edge and is prone to absorb H2O taking off the H-2 molecules, which is an apt water-splitting photocatalyst for hydrogen generation. The present work provides theoretical information to reveal the intrinsic nature of MoS2/CdS in terms of facet-dependent photocatalytic performance, and such an approach can be used to explore the surface effect of other heterostructures of transition-metal semiconductors.									49	1	0	0	1	0	50			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000454617200004

Although NKEF-A/Prx1 has been studied in different fish species, the present study broadens the knowledge of NKEF-A gene in terms of molecular structure, function, and immune responses in fish species. Hippocampus abdominalis NKEF-A (HaNKEF-A) cDNA encoded a putative protein of 198 amino acids containing a thioredoxin_2 domain, VCP motifs, and three conserved cysteine residues including peroxidatic and resolving cysteines. Amino acid sequence comparison and phylogenetic breakdown showed the higher sequence identity and closer evolutionary position of HaNKEF-A to those of other fish counterparts. A recombinant protein of HaNKEF-A was shown to i) protect supercoiled DNA against mixed catalyzed oxidation, ii) reduce insulin disulfide bonds, and iii) scavenge extracellular H2O2. Results of in vitro assays demonstrated the concentration dependent antioxidant function of recombinant HaNKEF-A. In addition, qPCR assessments revealed that the HaNKEF-A transcripts were constitutively expressed in fourteen tissues with the highest expression in liver. As an innate immune response, HaNKEF-A transcripts were up-regulated in liver post injection of LPS, Edwardsiella tarda, Streptococcus iniae, and polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid. Thus, HaNKEF-A can safeguards big-belly seahorse from oxidative damage and pathogenic infections. This study provides insight into the functions of NKEF-A/Prx1 in fish species.									9	0	0	0	9	0	9			0378-1119	1879-0038		WOS:000423892700042	29155258

In this work, a facile in-situ precipitation method was developed to prepare ultrafine amorphous iron oxyhydroxide/ultrathin g-C3N4 nanosheets heterojunction composites. The amorphous iron oxyhydroxide possessed an ultrafine particle size and a wide range of visible light absorption. In this process, the ultrafine particles not only shortened the diffusion distance of photogenerated carriers, but also facilitated the formation of more heterojunctions with ultrathin g-C3N4 nanosheets. The photocatalytic activities were evaluated using rhodamine B, methylene blue, and methyl orange as pollution models under visible light irradiation. Notably, the optimal photocatalytic activity of a-FeOOH/CNNS-800 composite is similar to 17.8 times higher than that of CNNS towards the degradation of rhodamine B under visible light. The outstanding photocatalytic activities were ascribed to the narrower band gap, the enhanced visible light absorbance, abundant heterojunction interfaces, and the effective separation of the photogenerated charges driven by the matched band edge in the heterostructures. We trusted that the facile and easy-to-extend synthesis method can be further expanded to synthesize other ultrafine semiconductors coupled with g-C3N4 for enhancing the photocatalytic activities.									46	5	0	0	8	0	48			2045-2322			WOS:000407864400067	28819141

The prepared Er3+:YAlO3/Pt-NaTaO3 was characterized by X-ray diffractometer (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX). By studying some influence factors such as Er3+:YAlO3 and Pt-NaTaO3 mass ratio, heat-treated temperature, visible-light irradiation time and solution acidity (pH) on the visible-light photocatalytic hydrogen production caused by Er3+:YAlO3/Pt-NaTaO3, it was found that the prepared Er3+:YAlO3/Pt-NaTaO3 with 0.3:1.0 mass ratio heat-treated at 500 degrees C for 120 min in weak acidic solution (pH = 5.0-6.0) with 5.0 wt% methanol displayed a high photocatalytic activity in hydrogen production from water solution.

The corrosion resistance was measured under simulated conditions corresponding to the conditions in high temperature proton exchange membrane (PEM) steam electrolysers. Steady-state voltammetry was used in combination with scanning electron microscopy and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy to evaluate the stability of the mentioned materials. It was found that stainless steels were the least resistant to corrosion under strong anodic polarisation. Among alloys, Ni-based showed the highest corrosion resistance in the simulated PEM electrolyser medium. In particular, Inconel (R) 625 was the most promising among the tested corrosion-resistant alloys for the anodic compartment in high temperature steam electrolysis. Tantalum showed outstanding resistance to corrosion in selected media. On the contrary, passivation of titanium was weak, and the highest rate of corrosion among all tested materials was observed for titanium at 120 degrees C. (C) 2010 Professor T. Nejat Veziroglu.

Via a list of trial catalyzed with FeF2/BiVO4 containing different contents of FeF2, the most efficient catalyst was optimised as the one with depositing FeF2 for 20 circles. Consequently, it able to produce the amount of 635.5 mu mol H-2 within 3 h, three times more than BiVO4 alone. The optimal photoanode of FeF2/BiVO4 exhibits a photocurrent density of 2.49 mA cm(-2) at 1.23 V vs. RHE and an IPCE value of 28% at 450 nm, which are 2.26 and 3.73 times as much as pure BiVO4 photoanode, respectively. It is mainly attributed to the enhanced capacities of light absorption in the visible range and transfer of photo-generated carriers as well as separation between electrons and holes after the combination of BiVO4 and FeF2. At the same time, it offers a novel idea toward the project of solar water splitting.									73	12	0	0	12	0	74			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000427616900051

Titanium oxide nanotubes were fabricated by anodising titanium foil in acid solution. Pt/Ti and Pt/TiO2 electrodes were characterised using electrochemical methods and scanning electron microscopy. Cyclic voltammetric analysis of Pt/Ti electrodes in dilute sulphuric acid yields voltammograms with features characteristic of bulk polycrystalline platinum electrodes. In contrast, the voltammograms for Pt/TiO2 electrodes are not quantitatively similar to those for smooth polycrystalline platinum electrodes. Voltammetry in potassium ferricyanide yields reversible voltammograms, indicating the good electrical conductivity of and connectivity between the deposited platinum and substrates and hence the absence of any significant resistive surface oxide film. The electrocatalytic behaviour of this type of electrodes in the glycerol electro-oxidation was studied.									41	1	0	0	2	0	42			0267-0844			WOS:000252613600005

Protistan phylogenies are particularly deficient and undoubtedly exclude clades of principal ecological and evolutionary importance (S. L. Baldauf, Science 300:1703-1706, 2003). The rRNA approach has been extraordinarily successful in expanding the global prokaryotic record (S. J. Giovannoni and M. S. Rappe, p. 47-84, in D.

Here we report the first application of the 18S rRNA approach to a permanently anoxic environment, the Cariaco Basin off the Venezuelan coast. On the basis of rRNA sequences, we uncovered a substantial number of novel protistan lineages. These included new clades of the highest taxonomic level unrelated to any known eukaryote as well as deep branches within established protistan groups. Three novel lineages branch at the base of the eukaryotic evolutionary tree preceding, contemporary with, or immediately following the earliest eukaryotic branches.

However, the practical applications of MSBs are still hampered by several critical challenges, i.e., the shuttle effects, sluggish redox kinetics, and low conductivity of sulfur species. Recently, benefiting from the high surface area, regulated networks, molecular/atomic-level reactive sites, the metal-organic frameworks (MOFs)-derived nanostructures have emerged as efficient and durable multifaceted electrodes in MSBs. Herein, a timely review is presented on recent advancements in designing MOF-derived electrodes, including fabricating strategies, composition management, topography control, and electrochemical performance assessment. Particularly, the inherent charge transfer, intrinsic polysulfide immobilization, and catalytic conversion on designing and engineering of MOF nanostructures for efficient MSBs are systematically discussed. In the end, the essence of how MOFs' nanostructures influence their electrochemical properties in MSBs and conclude the future tendencies regarding the construction of MOF-derived electrodes in MSBs is exposed. It is believed that this progress review will provide significant experimental/theoretical guidance in designing and understanding the MOF-derived nanostructures as multifaceted electrodes, thus offering promising orientations for the future development of fast-kinetic and robust MSBs in broad energy fields.									33	1	0	0	3	0	33			0935-9648	1521-4095		WOS:000653589400001	34031929

However, the biomarker record of steranes does not reveal their presence until the early Tonian Period (1000 to 720 Ma), suggesting that eukaryotic algae were insignificant ecosystem members for some one billion years after they evolved. Here, we conducted high-temperature pyrolysis and fixed-bed catalytic hydropyrolysis of kerogen from the ca. 1400 Ma Xiamaling Formation, liberating a host of lipid molecules, including C-27 to C-29 steranes. With sterane to hopane ratios ranging up to 0.17, our results indicate the presence of significant populations of both red and green algae at 1400 Ma, some 600 million years earlier than previously recognized.									10	4	0	0	4	0	12			0301-9268	1872-7433		WOS:000652097000020

The effect of PANI shell modification on the micro-structures, optical properties, as well as transfer dynamic behaviors and lifetime of charge carriers were investigated, respectively. Meanwhile, the catalytic oxidation process and the corresponding intermediates of 1,2-dichlorobenzene were investigated by in situ FTIR spectroscopy. More importantly, the optical absorption and the time-resolved photoluminescence investigation jointly corroborated that the enhancement of photocatalytic performance by modification of PANI shell was highly correlated with the substantially prolonged lifetime of charge carriers and simultaneously narrowing bandgap. Thus, it resulted in improved charge separation efficiency and visible-light absorption capability, respectively. This study provides an interesting insight and meaningful guideline for designing long-lifetime In2O3-based heterojunctions via conductive polymer coating.									50	3	0	0	9	0	50			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000510526000008

To explore the functions of FGF22 on other tissues and develop a large-scale production of recombinant human FGF22 (rhFGF22) without a fusion tag, a plasmid encoding human FGF22 (pET3a-rhFGF22) was used to express rhFGF22 in E. coli BL21 (DE3) pLysS. A large amount of rhFGF22 inclusion body protein was obtained. A two-step denaturing method successfully solubilized rhFGF22, and it was refolded and then purified in one step via heparin affinity chromatography. A yield of 105 mg rhFGF22 with a purity of up to 95% was obtained from 100 g wet bacteria. It was found that the rhFGF22 had biological activity, since it effectively attenuated H2O2-induced human hepatic L02 cell death. Analysis by qRT-PCR and Western blot demonstrated that rhFGF22 protects L02 cells from H2O2-induced oxidative damage via suppression of mitochondrial apoptosis pathways. In conclusion, the strategy described in this paper may provide a novel means to solve the production of insoluble rhFGF22 and shine new light on its translational potential.									1	0	0	0	1	0	1			1046-5928	1096-0279		WOS:000445591700015	29627393

Herein we develop a facile method to fabricate bimetallic Ni-Mo nitride nanotubes, which can serve as highly active and stable bifunctional electrocatalysts for full water splitting. To drive a current density of 10 mA cm(-2), the bimetallic Ni-Mo nitride nanotubes require an overpotential of 295 mV for the OER and 89 mV for the HER. The alkaline water electrolyzer with the nanotubes as cathode and anode catalysts requires a cell voltage of ca. 1.596 V to achieve a current density of 10 mA cm(-2). Furthermore, the nanotubes for full water splitting show excellent stability even at a high current density of 370 mA cm(-2), superior to the integrated performance of commercial Pt and IrO2. Our experimental results show that the NiOOH and NH groups formed at the catalyst surface during the OER process are active species for the OER, while the Ni(OH)(2), NH and Mo species at the catalyst surface play a key role in the HER. The present strategy may open an avenue for fabrication of low-cost, highly active and stable electrocatalysts for large-scale water splitting.									154	4	0	0	6	0	155			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000404618200039

Limestones, carbonate-rich mudstones, and black shales in SE France and central Switzerland, herein used as a proxy for the unmetamorphosed Schistes Lustres, bear a striking resemblance to sediments currently subducting into the E. Sunda margin.The Schistes Lustres, with estimated P-T conditions ranging from similar to 1 GPa and 350 degrees C to similar to 2.3 GPa and 550 degrees C, have on a regional scale had their average carbonate delta O-18(VSMOW) lowered to +20.4 parts per thousand, relative to the average of +28.5 parts per thousand of their likely protoliths. This decrease in delta O-18 can be most easily explained by varying combinations of: (1) closed-system equilibration of carbonate O with O in silicate minerals in the same rocks (i.e., at the mu m to cm scale); and (2) interaction between carbonates and H2O-rich fluids released during prograde metamorphic devolatilization of the metapelitic rocks in the section (at up to km scales). Regional-scale decrease in carbonate delta O-18 in the Schistes Lustres could have occurred without the need for infiltration by fluids generated outside of the Schistes Lustre's complex. More dramatic reductions in delta O-18 (as low as +8 parts per thousand; average = +15.5 parts per thousand) at/near major tectonic contacts, inferred to be fossil transient subduction interfaces, likely reflect deformation-enhanced infiltration by fluids derived in mafic or ultramafic rocks at greater depths.Pressure solution and concomitant cleavage formation in the Schistes Lustres presumably were associated with some carbonate removal, and higher-grade rocks show some evidence for decarbonation. However, within the Schistes Lustres, C is deposited as carbonate in locally abundant veins and it has proven difficult to identify clear evidence of wholesale carbonate removal from the complex (i.e., at scales of kms to 10s of kms). This study demonstrates that large fractions of subducted sedimentary carbonate sections could persist to depths approaching those beneath volcanic fronts, if they are not accreted or underplated and depending on the extents to which they are infiltrated by H2O-rich fluids capable of driving both decarbonation reactions and carbonate dissolution. Sediments such as these could supply C for additions to arc source regions or, with further subduction, convey C into the deeper mantle. The C removal and deposition reported by others for sites of particularly high fluid flux, along large fault systems, in zones of high fracture/vein density, and in metasomatized contacts with mafic/ultramafic rocks, contrast with the relative retention and lower degrees of mobilization of C observed within km-scale packets of Schistes Lustres away from zones of enhanced deformation and behaving as relatively closed systems. The fragmented and potentially lithologically biased nature of HP/UHP metamorphic suites greatly complicates attempts to derive fluid and C fluxes scalable to modern subduction margins.

Unfortunately, the long-term stability of the electrolyzer performance is still not fully understood under these input power profiles. In this study, we contrast the degradation behavior of our PEM water electrolysis single cells that occurs under operation with constant and intermittent power and derive preferable operating states. For this purpose, five different current density profiles are used, of which two were constant and three dynamic. Cells operated at 1 A cm(-2) show no degradation. However, degradation was observed for the remaining four profiles, all of which underwent periods of high current density (2 A cm(-2)). Hereby, constant operation at 2 A cm(-2) led to the highest degradation rate (194 mu V h(-1)). Degradation can be greatly reduced when the cells are operated with an intermittent profile. Current density switching has a positive effect on durability, as it causes reversible parts of degradation to recover and results in a substantially reduced degradation per mole of hydrogen produced. Two general degradation phenomena were identified, a decreased anode exchange current density and an increased contact resistance at the titanium porous transport layer (Ti-PTL).

Synthesis of carbon nanowalls template is performed by plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition in a CO/H-2 microwave discharge system. A well dispersion of amorphous MnO2 domains throughout carbon nanowalls template is obtained by potentiostatic anodic deposition technique. Carbon nanowalls enable to improve the capacitive behavior and rate capability of MnO2, a specific capacitance of 851 F g(-1) at a current density of 1 mA cm(-2) and charge transfer resistance of 1.02 Omega are obtained. MnO2/carbon nanowalls composite film exhibits energy density of 118 wh kg(-1), power density of 783 wh kg(-1), and capacitance retention of 92% after long cycle life of 2000 cycles by charging and discharging at 3 mA cm(-2). The high density of atomic scale graphitic edges and large surface area of carbon nanowalls in conjunction with the presence of amorphous MnO2 domains facilitate rapid electron and ion transport and hence offering the potential of the improved capacitive behavior.

However, a major drawback of low carrier separation efficiency restrains the development of photocatalysts. Here we design and fabricate an efficient 2D rGO/SnS2/Ag nanostructure photocatalyst which can split water into H2 and O2 without any sacrificial reagent. Specially, rGO nanosheets which is combined with ultrathin SnS2 nanoplates by C-S bond works as an electron shuttling mediator to extract the photoinduced holes. Ag nanoparticles induce electrons injection from SnS2 to Ag's surface in a co-catalytic fashion. Additionally, a theoretical study reveals that appropriate charge density distribution of rGO/SnS2/Ag and the lower work function of rGO synergistically realize the higher separation efficiency of photogenerated carriers and higher quantum yield. As a result, the rGO/SnS2/Ag nanostructure exhibits production rates of H2 and O2 as high as 137 and 68 mu mol h-1 g-1 under visible-light irradiation. This work may provide valuable guides in rationally designing new efficient photocatalysts for splitting pure water.									4	0	0	0	1	0	4			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000773001300003

In addition to being a feedstock and process gas for many industrial processes, hydrogen is emerging as a fuel alternative for transportation applications. Renewable sources of hydrogen are therefore required to increase in capacity. Low-temperature electrolysis of water is currently the most mature method for carbon-free hydrogen generation and is reaching relevant scales to impact the energy landscape. However, costs still need to be reduced to be economical with traditional hydrogen sources. Operating cost reductions are enabled by the recent availability of low-cost sources of renewable energy, and the potential exists for a large reduction in capital cost with material and manufacturing optimization. This article focuses on the current status and development needs by component for the low-temperature electrolysis options.									137	2	0	0	3	0	138			1947-5438	1947-5446	*****************	WOS:000471105100011	31173524

However, it remains unknown how this affects long-term stability. In this study, we elucidate the durability and degradation phenomena that occur in our test cells at high (2 A cm(-2)) and elevated (up to 3 A cm(-2)) current densities during constant and intermittent operation. Up to 2 A cm(-2), stable cell performance was achieved under both regime. At elevated current densities, two primary factors caused performance degradation, namely the increase in ohmic cell resistance and the appearance of mass-transport resistance, both of which contribute to the voltage increase in equal measures. By varying the way in which the cell is assembled, it was found that both effects relate to the anti-corrosion coating of the titanium porous transport layer (PTL), which was stable at 2 A cm(-2) but detached at certain points and adhered to the anodic side of the catalyst-coated membrane (CCM) under operation at elevated current densities. The results of this study indicate that PEM water electrolyzers can be coupled to intermittent power profiles from renewable energy sources without substantially affecting long-term stability.

The plasmonic Au-TiO2/ZnO core-shell NR photoanode provides a photocurrent density of 3.01 mAcm(-2) at 1.7V versus the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE), almost 1.5 and 3 times higher than that of TiO2/ZnO core-shell NRs and TiO2 NRs upon exposure into simulated solar light. Moreover, the plasmonic Au-TiO2/ZnO core-shell NR photoanode shows a clear photocurrent density under visible-light irradiation (lambda>400 nm) with a photocurrent density of 0.11 mAcm(-2) at 1.23V vs. RHE. The visible-light-excited photocurrent is mainly caused by the surface plasmon resonance effects produced by plasmonic Au nanoparticles, which benefit the visible-light absorption and charge separation of the wide-band-gap TiO2/ZnO heterojunction through the electrons and resonant energy transfer. Additionally, the strong interfacial interaction between TiO2 and ZnO leads to an effective photoinduced interfacial charge separation and transfer.									10	0	0	0	2	0	10			2194-4288	2194-4296		WOS:000410137900013

The morphology and structure evolution as a dependence of the growth parameters was thoroughly studied to elucidate the nucleation and crystallization of nonpolar GaN nanowires. It has been found that the V/III ratio and temperature are critically important for the formation of high-quality nonpolar GaN nanowires. The existence of a cubic GaN (c-GaN) transition layer between the Au catalyst and hexagonal GaN (h-GaN) nonpolar nanowires was demonstrated by high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) characterization, which plays an important role in the initial nucleation of nonpolar GaN nanowires and the formation of stacking faults (SFs) in the GaN nanowires grown at lower temperature. Optical investigations show that the defect-related visible emission of nonpolar GaN nanowires is closely related to the growth process and can be selectively tailored. The synthetic strategyy using GaCl3 as the Ga precursor to study the vapor phase epitaxy process in this work will provide a simple and efficient approach to obtain nonpolar GaN nanowires and will thus pave a solid way for fundamental research on high-quality nonpolar GaN nanowires in optoelectronic nanodevices.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000531408100015	32025692

Important issues in ASR include maintaining the injection rate and recovering water of suitable quality. Both of these depend on subsurface biogeochemical processes. This paper investigates the use of deuterium, O-18, C-13, C-14 and S-34 in understanding the reactions induced by reclaimed water injection in a carbonate aquifer at Bolivar, South Australia. Additionally, the injection scheme provides a natural laboratory to observe the process of carbon isotope exchange. The injectant deuterium (-6.4 +/- 2.9% versus Vienna standard mean ocean water (V-SMOW)) and O-18 (-0-9 +/- 0.5% V-SMOW) signature is more enriched and variable than the native groundwater signature of -26 +/- 1% and -4-4 +/- 0- 1% respectively. The variability of the injectant signature is maintained with injectant migration and is useful in constraining the portion of the injected end-member reaching observation wells. Effluent treatment results in total dissolved inorganic carbon (TDIC) enriched in C-13 (-3.3 +/- 2.5% versus Pee Dee belemnite) and modern carbon (100 +/- 7 per cent modem carbon (pmC)), which is distinct from the native groundwater comparatively depleted in C-13 (- 11 +/- 1%) and C-14 (5.6 +/- 2.1 pmC). The carbon isotopic signature in groundwater 4 m from the ASR well is dominated by the injectant signature modified by some organic matter oxidation and calcite dissolution. However, with further migration to the 50 m radius, both C-13 and C-14 signatures are dominated by isotopic exchange with the matrix surface (initially in equilibrium with the ambient groundwater) and little overall dissolution. During storage, biogeochemical processes, including sulphate reduction and methanogenesis, are dominant near the ASR well. These are indicated by a sulphate decline of up to 1.5 mmol l(-1) with around 12% enrichment in the residual sulphate (versus Canyon Diablo troilite) and the addition of TDIC enriched in C-13, while maintaining a modern C-14 activity.

The main challenges that the state-of-the-art PEMWEs are currently facing are excessive cost and poor durability. Understanding the failure modes in PEMWEs is a key factor for improving their durability, lowering the precious metal loading, and hence cost reduction. In this work, reactive spray deposition technology (RSDT) has been used to fabricate a membrane electrode assembly (MEA) with one order of magnitude lower Pt and Ir catalyst loadings (0.2-0.3 mg(PGM) cm(-2)) in comparison to the precious metal loadings in the stat-of-the-art commercial MEAs (2-3 mg(P)(GM) cm(-2)). As fabricated MEA with an active area of 86 cm(2), has been tested for over 5000 h at steady-state conditions that are typical for an industrial hydrogen production system. Herein, we present and discuss the results from a comprehensive post-test analysis of the MEA of interest. The main degradation mechanisms, governing the performance loss in the RSDT fabricated MEA with ultra-low precious metal loadings, have been identified and discussed in detail. All failure modes are critically compared and the main degradation mechanism with the highest impact on the MEA performance loss among the others is identified.

Herein, a unique 3D hierarchical sheet-on-sheet heterojunction between Fe(OH)(3) and beta-Ni(OH)(2) on pretreated Ni foam (NiFe-HD/pre-NF) was fabricated by a two-step strategy involving the interfacial hydrolysis-deposition of Fe2+ and electrodeposition of Ni2+. The presence of the Ni-O-Fe bridge at the Fe(OH)(3)/beta-Ni(OH)(2) heterointerface can induce interfacial electronic redistribution to form Ni3+ in NiFe-HD/pre-NF, and further strengthen the adsorption of OH- and weaken the O-H bond to change the rate-determining step (RDS) for accelerating OER kinetics. Benefiting from the sheet-on-sheet architecture and dual-phase synergism on NiFe-HD/pre-NF, the optimal NiFe-HD/pre-NF exhibits excellent OER performance with a lower overpotential of 256 mV at 100 mA cm(-2), a small Tafel slope of 81 mV dec(-1), high intrinsic activity and robust stability. Alkaline water-splitting using NiFe-HD/pre-NF as the anode requires ultralow cell voltages of 1.62 V and 1.83 V at current densities of 100 mA cm(-2) and 400 mA cm(-2), respectively, which are comparable with commercial alkaline water electrolysis, and operates steadily at a current density of 100 mA cm(-2) for 85 h without decay. This work proposes a facile strategy for constructing heterojunctions and modulating electronic interaction to develop electrocatalysts with new architectures.									6	0	0	0	1	0	6			1477-9226	1477-9234		WOS:000686257500001	34545883

The as-sintered RHEA co-doped with C, N, and O exhibited ultra-high strength and hardness of 4345 MPa and 11.88 GPa, respectively. The microstructural observations indicated that both N and O were completely reacted with the refractory metallic elements to in-situ generate massive dispersed refractory compounds of (Nb,Ti)N and Ti2O3, while C was mainly dissolved in the BCC solid-solution phase. The strengthening mechanisms of the multiple nonmetallic atoms (C, N, and O) were discussed in this paper. The results demonstrated that the excellent mechanical properties were not only attributed to the traditional solid solution, grain boundary, Orowan strengthening mechanisms, but also to the additional C interstitial strengthening and dispersed refractory compounds of (Nb,Ti)N and Ti2O3.									22	3	0	0	0	0	23			0921-5093	1873-4936		WOS:000573287500002

The structures and morphologies of as-synthesized Co9S8/rGO nanocomposites were characterized by X-ray diffractometer (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscope (TEM). The results reveal that Co(9)S(8)is homogeneously dispersed on the surface of rGO microspheres. The significantly enhanced photocatalytic activity of Co9S8/rGO nanocomposites in comparison with a pure Co(9)S(8)was investigated by the degradation of methylene blue (MB) using ultraviolet (UV) spectroscopy. The photodegradation ratios of MB using flower-like Co9S8/rGO nanocomposites with a Co(9)S(8)mass ratio of 67.3, 35.3 and 55.6 wt% are about 86.7, 92.0, and 98.7%, respectively, after irradiation for 80 min. By comparing the nanocomposites and pure flower-like Co9S8, the pure Co(9)S(8)showed less photocatalytic activity upon the degradation of MB than the nanocomposites. It can be attributed to the improved electron-hole pair separation and enhanced adsorption due to the presence of rGO microspheres.									7	0	0	0	0	0	7			1574-1443	1574-1451		WOS:000554341100003

This rock association is part of the anorthosite-mangerite-charnockite-(rapakivi-)granite suites that are restricted to the Proterozoic. Understanding the geochemistry and emplacement mechanisms of ilmenite, magnetite and apatite ore deposits is crucial for exploration, efficient mining operations and ore processing. This review discusses the controlling factors on the grade of an ore, its mineralogy, and its major and trace element distribution. We present petrogenetic models of currently mined deposits (Lac Tio, Tellnes, Damiao) and discuss the characteristics of minor ore bodies from anorthosite provinces worldwide (Grenville, North China Craton, East European Craton, Rogaland, Laramie). Models of formation of anorthosite and related rocks are presented, as well as the nature of the possible parental magmas of the suite. A mineralogical classification of Fe-Ti ores is proposed: (1) Gabbro-noritic ilmenite ore +/- apatite +/- magnetite; (2) Ti-magnetite-dominated ore; (3) Nelsonite (Fe-Ti oxides + apatite); and (4) Rutile-ilmenite ore. The stability of ilmenite and magnetite is then critically reviewed and the influence of various factors, particularly oxygen fugacity and crystallization pressure, is examined. We discuss liquidus compositions of Fe-Ti oxides and the behavior of important trace elements such as Cr and V, both of which are sensitive to fO(2) variations. Postcumulus evolution of both oxides can occur due to re-equilibration with trapped liquid, re-equilibration with ferromagnesian silicates, exsolution, oxidation, reaction between ilmenite and magnetite, and metamorphic overprinting. These various processes are described and their effects on the oxide geochemistry are emphasized. Several potential ore-forming processes have been invoked and can explain the formation of huge concentration of ilmenite, +/- magnetite, +/- apatite. Fractional crystallization can be combined with crystal sorting and plagioclase buoyancy to produce relative enrichment of dense ore minerals. Silicate liquid immiscibility can segregate conjugate Si-rich and Fe-rich melts, the latter being enriched in Fe-Ti-P. Magma mixing can produce hybrid magmas located in a single-phase field of the phase diagram and precipitate a pure ilmenite cumulate. Alternative processes are also described, such as ejection of Fe-Ti-enriched residual melts by filter-pressing and compaction, solidstate remobilization of ilmenite in veins, and hydrothermal transport of Fe and Ti from the host anorthosite followed by concentration in veins and lenticular ore bodies. The magnetic properties of Fe-Ti ore deposits present contrasting signatures, depending on whether the natural remanent magnetization is dominated by hemo-ilmenite or multi-domain magnetite. Micro- and macro-scale deformation features of ore rocks are intimately correlated with magma emplacement, and with ballooning of the anorthosite diapir associated with gravitational sagging of dense ore bodies. Exploration perspectives show that oxide-apatite gabbronorites are interesting targets because ilmenite in these rocks is poorer in Cr and Mg, and because the Ti-resource may be combined with apatite and vanadiferous magnetite.

Different titanium meshes (4 commercial ones and 4 modified ones) with various properties are experimentally examined by operating a cell with each mesh under different conditions. The average pore diameter, thickness, and contact angle of the anode current collector are controlled in the ranges of 10-35 mu m, 0.2 -0.3 mm, and 0-120 degrees, respectively. These results showed that increasing the temperature from the conventional temperature of 80 degrees C to the boiling point could reduce both the open circuit voltage and the overvoltages to a large extent without notable dehydration of the membrane. These results also showed that decreasing the contact angle and the thickness suppresses the electrolysis overvoltage largely by decreasing the concentration overvoltage. The effect of the average pore diameter was not evident until the temperature reached the boiling point. Using operating conditions of 100 degrees C and 2 A/cm(2), the electrolysis voltage is minimized to 1.69 V with a hydrophilic titanium mesh with an average pore diameter of 21 mu m and a thickness of 0.2 mm.

The TiO2 nanosheets/C composite exhibited a boosted photocatalytic activity under visible light condition up to three times of benchmark Degussa P25. It was revealed that the high photocatalytic activity can be ascribed to three major aspects. One was that the stacked nanosheets with ordered structure inherited from the 2D MXene, endowed a favorable electron-hole separation and transportation. The second was the decoration of carbon layer that evidently extended the absorption to more visible light region. Besides, the carbon layer also facilitated the separation and migration of photogenerated carriers. The proposed in-situ carbonization strategy with a uniformly decoration on TiO2 with remarkable visible light photocatalytic activity would greatly promote the wide application of TiO2 such as in photocatalytic water splitting.									50	0	0	0	8	0	50			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000526110500040

In this work, a series of spinel-structured nanosheets wrapped hollow nitrogen-doped carbon polyhedrons were constructed, and doped transition-metal domains were deliberately introduced on the surface. Theoretical investigations show that their energy level can be finely tuned via direct transition-metal doping engineering. As a prototype, an Fe-doped NiCo2O4 nanosheets wrapped hollow nitrogen-doped carbon polyhedron (Fe-NiCo2O4@HNCP) exhibits outstanding bifunctional electrocatalytic performances with low overpotentials ( = 270 mV for OER, = 84 mV for HER), low Tafel slopes (b = 42 mV dec(-1) for OER, b = 47 mV dec(-1) for HER), and high durability. The enhanced performance is attributed to the synergistic effects of energy level matching for electron transfer, and partial charge delocalization-induced rich active sites for reactant adsorption via thermodynamic and kinetic acceleration. This work may open a new pathway to design highly active and stable transition-metal doped electrocatalysts by manipulated energy levels for efficient overall water splitting.									34	3	0	0	3	0	34			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000455124900040

But their morphology and chemical compositions play critical role in tuning their catalytic activities, and precious metal contents. While advanced microscopy techniques facilitate morphological characterizations, traditional chemical characterizations are either qualitative or extremely involved. In this study, we apply Laser Induced Breakdown Spectroscopy (LIBS) for quantitative compositional analysis of NAs and NCs synthesized with varied elemental ratios by our in-house built pulsed laser ablation technique. Specifically, elemental ratios of binary PtNi, PdCo (NAs) and PtCo (NCs) of different compositions are determined from LIBS measurements employing an internal calibration scheme using the bulk matrix species as internal standards. Morphology and qualitative elemental compositions of the aforesaid NAs and NCs are confirmed from Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) images and Energy Dispersive X-ray Spectroscopy (EDX) measurements. LIBS experiments are carried out in ambient conditions with the NA and NC samples drop cast on silicon wafers after centrifugation to increase their concentrations. The technique does not call for cumbersome sample preparations including acid digestions and external calibration standards commonly required in Inductively Coupled Plasma -Optical Emission Spectroscopy (ICP-OES) techniques. Yet the quantitative LIBS results are in good agreement with the results from ICP-OES measurements. Our results indicate the feasibility of using LIBS in future for rapid and in situ quantitative chemical characterizations of wide classes of synthesized NM and NCs.									38	0	0	0	10	1	38			0039-9140	1873-3573		WOS:000393244400048	28107937	
J	Genu, V; Godecke, S; Hollenberg, CP; Pereira, GG								The Hansenula polymorpha MOX gene presents two alternative transcription start points differentially utilized and sensitive to respiratory activity								EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF BIOCHEMISTRY				270	11			2467	2475		10.1046/j.1432-1033.2003.03618.x				JUN 2003	2003	The peroxisomal methanol metabolism of Hansenula polymorpha depends on a group of genes that are coordinately regulated. Methanol oxidase (Mox) plays a key role in this pathway and its synthesis has been shown to be regulated at the transcriptional level. MOX expression is strongly repressed on glucose and activated on glycerol or methanol. In this study we have identified two MOX transcripts that are differentially expressed along MOX derepression. The first one, named l-MOX (for longer MOX ), starts at position -425, is only weakly and transiently transcribed and is not translated into the Mox protein. The other is the true MOX mRNA, which initiates around position -25. Using a strain bearing multiple copies of MOX (Q1N) and a reporter gene fused to the MOX promoter, regulation of the two transcripts was investigated. Initiation of the true MOX correlates with repression of l-MOX and conditions that are repressive for MOX transcription, such as the inhibition of mitochondrial activity, lead to higher levels of l-MOX expression. This effect was first observed in a mox mutant (Q1N-M8) unable to grow on nonfermentable carbon sources. No function was detected for l-MOX , but its regulation follows a pattern similar to that of catalase, which is essential for methanol metabolism. This suggests that, l-MOX , although precisely regulated, seems to be a remnant of the evolution of the methanol metabolism network.									9	0	0	0	9	1	10			0014-2956			WOS:000183030700015	12755702

By directly growing an ultrathin Fe2WO6 layer on a preformed WO3 nanosheet array in full coverage, a uniform and dense array of intimately contacted WO3/Fe2WO6 heterojunction was created. The heterojunction array shows not only a largely broadened visible light absorption range but also a built-in interface polarization to accelerate hole transfer from WO3 to Fe2WO6. Meanwhile, fine-tuning to match energy levels at the heterojunction was achieved by doping WO3 with Fe (Fe-WO3), leading to improved electrical conductivity and reduced charge recombination. Photoanodes based on such heterojunction arrays have shown significantly enhanced photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting performance, clearly arising from the above-mentioned efforts. Furthermore, by decorating FeOOH/NiOOH cocatalysts on the heterojunction arrays in tandem, the surface water oxidation kinetics was considerably accelerated, and the resulting Fe-WO3/Fe2WO6/FeOOH/NiOOH photoanode achieved a photocurrent density of 2.78 mA/cm(2) at 1.23 V vs reversible hydrogen electrode. This work highlights the benefits of in situ construction of heterojunction arrays for enhancing the PEC performance.									13	0	0	0	1	0	13			0021-9606	1089-7690		WOS:000539392200004	32505145

The electrodes were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), atomic force microscope (AFM), cyclic voltammetry (CV) and electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS). From the results of XRD, oxide films prepared at low temperature were in amorphous state, while hydrous IrO2 crystal and cassiterite phase SnO2 were formed at 300 degreesC or even to 500 degreesC. The highly porous structure was confirmed by AFM. The electrochemical experiments demonstrated that the sol-gel method made the ITEs having a fast electron transfer process with good stability and the optimal preparation temperature was 400 degreesC for the highest electroactivity. Furthermore, the electrocatalysis of pyrocatechol on the electrodes was investigated. A quasi-reversible process occurred and a linear range over three orders magnitude (1 x 10(-2) - 10 mM) was obtained by differential pulse voltammetry (DPV). Meanwhile the detection limit of pyrocatechol was 5 x 10(-3) mM. This study indicated that the sol-gel method was an appropriate route to prepare the IrO2/SnO2 electrodes for the electrocatalytic of pyrocatechol. (C) 2003 Acta Materialia Inc.

We present data on the temporal and spatial compositional variations in lavas and melt inclusions from Kick-'em-Jenny and four lavas from Kick-'em-Jack. Analyses of crater samples from Kick-'em-Jenny show an evolution in magma compositions between 1972 and 2013/14. Rock types have progressed from predominantly basalts in 1972 to basaltic andesites in 2013/14, while melt inclusions have also become more silicic over time, ranging basaltic to andesitic in 1972 and basaltic andesite to dacitic in 2013/14. Hornblende-phyric basalts are unusually rich in MgO (<= 13 wt%) and Ni (<= 230 ppm) and contain rare olivine phenocryst cores of Fo(90-92), suggestive of a primitive character. Other phenocryst phases include spinel, clinopyroxene and plagioclase. Conversely, 2013/14 landslide deposit samples contain orthopyroxene as an additional phenocryst phase and are distinct from crater deposits in terms of phenocryst and bulk rock chemistry. We propose that 1972 and 2013/14 crater deposits sample Kick-'em-Jenny's current edifice, whereas 2013/14 landslide deposits likely represent "proto Kick-'em-Jenny" (an edifice existing pre 43.5 kyr BP). Geochemical data for Kick-'em-Jack support the notion that it is part of the same volcanic complex as Kick-'em-Jenny and probably represents part of the now collapsed proto Kick-'em-Jenny.Low eruption temperatures (similar to 1000 degrees C), estimated from geothermometry, coupled with whole-rock magma chemistry suggest an origin of the most mafic lavas of Kick-'em-Jenny by dehydration melting of hornblende-peridotite just below the Moho. Subsequent injection of these cool, oxidised, wet primitive basalts into the deep crust was accompanied early fractionation of hornblende-dominated assemblages. Large, zoned hornblende phenocrysts track rapid ascent of magmas through the crust along a trajectory sub-parallel to the hornblende liquidus curve. Melt inclusion data provide clear evidence of volatile-rich (<= 5 wt% H2O and <3200 ppm CO2) pre-eruptive magma storage 7-12 km below Kick-'em-Jenny. This new understanding of the architecture of Kick-'em-Jenny's sub-volcanic system will be useful for interpreting future seismic signals and mitigating volcanic hazards. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Further, their physico-chemical properties can be modified by surface functionalization. Acid functionalization of CNTs is one of the basic methodology for modification of their electro-chemical properties, resolving the poor dispersion capability, and improving the surface-active sites to enhance the photocatalytic efficiency. However, the role of surface functional groups on CNTs for water-splitting in association with CdS photocatalysts has not yet been sufficiently explored. Hence, in the present study, we report the influence of surface-functionalized CNT-metal nanoparticle (NP) hybrids attached to CdS nanorods for enhanced photocatalytic H-2 production. Significant improvement in photocatalytic H-2 production was observed for binary composites such as amine (Nf-), sulfonic (Sf-), and ascorbic acid (Af-) functionalized CNTs and CdS nanorods. Furthermore, the secondary functionalized Af-CNTs were incorporated with metal NPs and the photocatalytic activity was significantly improved in ternary metal-Af-CNT/CdS nanohybrids. Among the metal NPs, Pt- incorporated into Af-CNTs and its CdS nanohybrid led to the highest rate of H-2 production (120.1 mmol h(-1) g(-1)), corresponding to a 48-fold enhancement relative to that of pure CdS. The enhanced rate of H-2 production is attributed to the influence of the surface functional groups on the CNTs. The intimate interfacial contact between CdS, functionalized CNTs and metal NPs leads to enhanced photocatalytic performance, as a contributing factor for improving photogenerated charge separation and transportation. Moreover, the functional groups on CNTs (Pt-Af-CNT/CdS) led to obvious advantages, such as enhanced photoactivity and photostability of CdS for H-2 production. The photocatalytic performance of these nanohybrids was found to be highly influenced by the surface states of the CNTs, suggesting the importance of surface treatment of materials for H-2 evolution.									54	4	0	0	5	0	55			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000437965900030

This study examines the effectiveness of simultaneous-phase and morphology-controlled manganese dioxide nanomaterials, designed by annealing a hydrothermally synthesized flower-like -manganese dioxide precursor at 300-800 degrees C, as cathode catalysts for MFCs. MFCs with the best-performing catalyst cathode (at a reasonable mass loading) were also analyzed through cyclic voltammetry and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. Among MFCs with non-annealed and annealed manganese dioxide cathodes (0.5 mg cm(-2)), those with the catalyst annealed at 500 degrees C (148 +/- 7 mW m(-2), CE = 13 +/- 1%) generated the most power (5-52%). MFCs with the catalyst annealed at 500 degrees C at a loading of 1 mg cm(-2) as the cathode delivered the highest maximum power density (213 +/- 9 mW m(-2), CE = 13 +/- 1%), representing 44% of that obtained using Pt/C at 0.5 mg Pt per cm(2) (483 +/- 11 mW m(-2), CE = 18 +/- 2%) and a comparatively low internal resistance (164 +/- 2 ). Both cyclic voltammetry and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy results were consistent with empirical data. Compared with previously reported cathode materials, the annealed product from the precursor flower-like -manganese dioxide annealed at 500 degrees C (particularly at a loading of 1 mg cm(-2)) was a more reliable, efficient, and inexpensive sustainable cathode catalyst for scaled-up MFCs.									19	0	0	0	4	0	19			1477-9226	1477-9234		WOS:000465328200034	30951077

Delaminated CoAl-layered double hydroxide nanosheets (LDH-DS) combined with TiO2 nanotubes (NTs) or nanoparticles (NPs) are promising nanocomposite photocatalysts for CO2 reduction. Heterojunction formation between visible light absorbing delaminated CoAl nanosheets and UV light absorbing TiO2 nanotubes greatly enhances interfacial contact between both high aspect ratio components relative to their bulk counterparts. The resulting synergic interaction confers a significant improvement in photoinduced charge carrier separation, and concomitant aqueous phase CO2 photocatalytic reduction, in the absence of a sacrificial hole acceptor. CO productivity for a 3 wt% LDH-DS@TiO2-NT nanocomposite of 4.57 mu mol g(cat)(-1) h(-1) exhibits a tenfold and fivefold increase over that obtained for individual TiO2 NT and delaminated CoAl-LDH components respectively and is double that obtained for 3 wt% bulk-LDH@TiO2-NT and 3 wt% LDH-DS@TiO2-NP catalysts. Synthesis of delaminated LDH and metal oxide nanocomposites represents a cost-effective strategy for aqueous phase CO2 reduction.									26	2	0	0	0	0	26			0934-0866	1521-4117		WOS:000423103600012

Upon complete pyrolysis of the cobalt-nickel-hydroxide precursor, high-quality crystalline NiCo2O4 is achieved. The porous NiCo2O4 nanowires were found to be highly active for catalytic water oxidation when serving as the working electrodes without any external materials (binder and/or carbon black), as evidenced by exhibiting higher catalytic current density for water oxidation compared to precious metal oxide catalysts such as iridium oxide (IrO2) under the same conditions and appreciable catalytic wave at similar to 1.52 V (vs. RHE). The optimal performance of the as-synthesized NiCo2O4 nanowires showed a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) under an overpotential of only 0.46 V and 20 mA cm(-2) under an overpotential of 0.72 V, corresponding to a Faradaic efficiency of nearly 100%. The atomic-scale analysis of the NiCo2O4 nanowires was further conducted by spherical-aberration-corrected transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The highly exposed high-index facets and one-dimensional (1D) configuration of the as-synthesized porous NiCo2O4 nanowires may be responsible for the high catalytic performance of water oxidation, which exhibit excellent activity and unique advantages for catalytic water splitting.									96	6	0	0	2	0	98			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000345531200051

The binaphthol-based polyamide acid is synthesized from 2,2'-diol-1,1'-binaphthyl-6,6'-diamine and 4,4'-(hexafluoroisopro-pylidene)diphthalic anhydride (6FDA). Then, an azeotropic imidiaztion method was used to synthesize the polyimide with naphthol groups (XS1). When the imidization is carried out by using acetic anhydride, the polyimide with acetyl groups (XS4) is achieved. The CMS membranes prepared by pyrolyzing XS1 and XS4 at 500, 550, and 600 degrees C are named using the temperature as the suffix, such as XS1-500. Their pore evolution has been investigated using TGA, FTIR, XRD, and Raman measurements. The trimodal pore-size distribution is in the carbon molecular sieve (CMS) membranes derived from XS4 and the CMS ones derived from XS1 exhibit a bimodal pore structure. Among them, XS4-500 exhibits the highest gas permeabilities of 3332 barrer for CO2, 773 barrer for O-2, and 119 barrer for N-2. XS1-500 only affords the CO2, O-2, and N-2 permeabilities of 1086, 230, and 30.2 barrer. The esterification of naphthol not just disturbs the hydrogen bonds between polyimide chains but also affects the pore generation of the derived CMS membranes. Our work provides an effective way to enhance the gas permeability of a CMS membrane derived from the binaphthol-based polyimide. (C) 2020 The Korean Society of Industrial and Engineering Chemistry.

J	Ghirardi, ML; Lutton, TW; Seibert, M								Interactions between diphenylcarbazide, zinc, cobalt, and manganese on the oxidizing side of photosystem II								BIOCHEMISTRY				35	6			1820	1828		10.1021/bi951657d				FEB 13 1996	1996	The inhibition of DPC-mediated DCIP photoreduction by exogenous MnCl2 in Tris-treated photosystem II (PSII) membrane fragments has been used to probe for amino acids on the PSII reaction center proteins, including D1His337, that provide ligands for binding manganese [Preston, C., & Seibert, M. (1990) in Current Research in Photosynthesis (Baltscheffsky, M., Ed.) Vol. I, pp 925-928, Kluwer Academic Publishers. Dordrecht, The Netherlands; Preston, C., & Seibert, M. (1991) Biochemistry 30, 9615-9624 and 9625-9633]. At a concentration of 200 mu M, DPC is photooxidized at both a high-affinity and a low-affinity site in PSII at approximately the same initial rate. Addition of 10 mu M MnCl2 noncompetitively inhibits DPC photooxidation at the high-affinity site, with a K-i of 1.5 mu M, causing a decrease of about 50% in the overall DCIP photoreduction rate. The high-affinity site for Mn binding was deconvoluted into four independent components. In earlier work, the inhibition was attributed to the tight association of either Mn2+ or Mn3+ with the PSII membrane. We report here that inhibition of DPC photooxidation may involve two different types of high-affinity, Mn-binding components: (a) one that is specific for Mn, and (b) others that bind Mn, but may also bind additional divalent cations, such as Zn and Co, that are not photooxidized by PSII. These conclusions are based on the observations that (a) DPC photooxidation can be inhibited by Zn2+ and Co2+; (b) Zn2+ and Co2+ interact with Mn2+ in a nonmutually exclusive manner, suggesting that they may share some binding components with Mn2+; (c) high-affinity Mn2+ (but not Zn2+ or Co2+) inhibition of DPC photooxidation is accompanied by nondecaying fluorescence emission, following a single saturating flash, indicating efficient electron donation by Mn2+ to Y-z(+); (d) Mn2+ photooxidation in the presence of DPC is not inhibited by Zn2+ or Co2+; and (e) kinetic modeling of the interaction between high-affinity Mn2+ and DPC in PSII indicates inhibition of steady-state Mn2+ photooxidation by DPC, but allows for a single photooxidation of Mn2+. We conclude that Mn inhibition of DPC photooxidation can be used to identify Mn-binding sites of physiological importance, and suggest that the Mn-specific component of the high-affinity, Mn-binding site involves the ligand to the first Mn bound during photoactivation (i.e., Asp170 on D1, as found by other investigators).									48	1	1	0	40	0	49			0006-2960			WOS:A1996TV60000015	8639663

However, the immunologic property of MIF in freshwater fish is limitedly known by now. In the present study, MIF gene was identified in grass carp. Bioinformatics analysis revealed that the molecular weight of grass carp MIF protein was 12.377 kDa and it could also bind to CD74. MIF gene was predominantly expressed in immune tissues including spleen and head kidney, then liver, skin, gill, intestine and blood, while a relative low level expression in heart, brain, fat and red muscle. The predicted receptor and tissues distribution of MIF implied the immunologic activity of grass carp MIF. Then grass carp MIF antigen and the polyclonal antibodies against it were prepared. Using cadmium as an immunosuppressive agent, MIF expression in spleen and head kidney was depressed in a dose-dependent manner with cadmium consumption. On the same time, white blood cell count decrease displayed a similar pattern with MIF expression, which suggested a possible positive correlation between MIF and white blood cell count. Thereafter, MIF enhanced the viability of grass carp peripheral blood leukocytes and inhibited cell apoptosis with depressed reactive oxygen species production in vitro. In addition, recombinant grass carp MIF promoted tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), interleukin 1 beta (IL1 beta) and interleukin 6 (IL6) secretion from peripheral blood leukocytes. These results indicated the immunologic property of grass carp MIF.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			1050-4648	1095-9947		WOS:000564306100007	32580004

In this work, a layered Bi-WN photocatalyst with a heterojunction was prepared by reducing flake-shaped WN and flower-shaped Bi2O3 in an ammonia atmosphere. Under the process of NIR light (lambda > 700 nm)-driven water splitting, the optimal hydrogen (H-2) generation rates based on the Bi-WN photocatalyst can reach to 7.49 mu mol g(-1) h(-1), which is 2.47 times higher than that of WN of 3.03 mu mol g(-1) h(-1). The result indicates that the Bi-WN photocatalyst can be effective under NIR light. Through ultraviolet-visible-NIR diffuse reflectance spectrum analysis, it can be seen that the light absorption edge of Bi-WN is obviously redshifted. Combining the results of electrochemical characterizations, we have found that the addition of the Bi metal plays an important role in NIR light-driven water splitting. Under irradiation of NIR light, the electrons on the Bi-WN substrate are stronger due to local surface plasmon resonance, which reduces the possibility of recombination of photogenerated electrons and holes on WN. In addition, after the Bi metal absorbs the photon energy, the electron-hole pairs are separated, and the H-2 production rate increases significantly under the combined action of the charge transfer mechanism and the local electric field enhancement mechanism.									12	0	0	0	1	0	12			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000648552500031	33896176

In the selection of tree species to maximise ecosystem services, tolerance to site characteristics such as flooding and severe drought is of critical importance. This study evaluated the suitability of a rare species, Mims subcordata C.A. Mey (Caucasian alder) from the Hyrcanian forests of southern Azerbai-jan, for its functionality as an urban tree.A total of 48 pot-grown, two-year-old saplings of A. subcordata were tested in a greenhouse experiment using a complete randomised block design. Each block contained four replicates of three treatments (waterlogging, drought, control), with 16 plants per treatment. Height differences between treatments were measured, and water status was estimated by determination of midday leaf water potential (psi(L)) and stomatal conductance (g(s)). To estimate drought tolerance reaction in the treatments, leaf water potential at turgor loss (psi(P0)) was used together with broken-stick modelling of water status over time.A. subcordata plants showed no height increase, while plants in both the waterlogged and control treatments increased in height during the nine-week experiment. Over 63 days of flooding, plant water status was slightly more negative in the waterlogging treatment, but did not deviate essentially from the control. In the drought treatment, plant water status rapidly deviated from the control. There was a significant difference in psi(P0) between treatments, with drought-treated plants showing the lowest value (-2.31 MPa).This study demonstrated that A. subcordata has limited tolerance to drought and seems to rely more on water loss-avoiding strategies. However, the species may be usable at periodically waterlogged sites, due to its high tolerance to flooding. It could therefore be recommended for wet urban environments and stormwater management facilities, for which reliable guidance on suitable trees is currently lacking.									3	0	0	0	1	0	3			1641-1307	2083-8387		WOS:000674746000005

In the current study, two selenium-dependent glutathione peroxidases (AbSeGPxs) that shared 54.3% identity were identified from the disk abalone Haliotis discus discus. The open reading frames (ORFs) of AbSeGPx-a and AbSeGPx-b coded for 222 and 220 amino acids, respectively, with a characteristic selenocysteine residue encoded by an opal stop codon (TGA). The conserved selenocysteine insertion sequence (SECIS) element was predicted in the 3' untranslated region (UTR) of both isoforms, and they were found to form two stem-loop structures. Amino acid comparison and phylogenetic studies revealed that the AbSeGPxs were closely related to those in other mollusk species and were evolutionarily distinct from those of other taxonomic groups. The SYBR Green qPCR was employed in investigating the transcripts of AbSeGPxs. The expression of AbSeGPxs mRNA was examined in different embryonic developmental stages and differential expression patterns for AbSeGPx-a and AbSeGPx-b were noted. Meanwhile, the highest expression of AbSeGPxs was detected in the hepatopancreas of healthy adult animals. Next, transcriptional levels were profiled in hemocytes of adults to determine the immune responses of AbSeGPxs to microbial infections. The results revealed the significant up-regulation of AbSeGPx-a in a time-dependent manner after bacterial (Listeria monocytogenes and Vibrio parahaemolyticus) and viral (viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus) infections. Consequently, these findings indicate that AbSeGPx-a and AbSeGPx-b might be involved in the embryonic development of disk abalone and the regulation of immune defense system of adult animals.

(1987) Biochim. Biophys. Acta 890, 89-96] was used to assess the amount of the high-affinity Mn-binding site in manganese-depleted photosystem II (PS II) membrane fragments from spinach and Scenedesmus obliquus. The assay mechanism at high DPC concentration was shown to involve noncompetitive inhibition of only half of the control level of DPC donation to PS II by micromolar concentrations of Mn at pH 6.5 (i.e., one of two DPC donation sites is inhibited). At low DPC concentration both DPC and Mn2+ donate to PS II additively. Treatment with the carboxyl amino acid modifier 1-ethyl-3-[3-(dimethylamino)propyl]carbodiimide (EDC) inhibited half of the high-affinity Mn-binding site in spinach and Scenedesmus WT PS II membranes and all of the available site in Scenedesmus LF-1 mutant PS II membranes. A similar EDC concentration dependence was observed in all cases. Addition of 2 mM MnCl2 to the 10 mM EDC modification buffer provided complete protection for the Mn-binding site from modification. This protection was specific for Mn2+; six other divalent cations were ineffective. We conclude that EDC modifies that half of the high-affinity Mn-binding site that is insensitive to the histidine modifier diethyl pyrocarbonate (DEPC) [Seibert, M., Tamura, N., & Inoue, Y. (1989) Biochim. Biophys. Acta 974, 185-191] and directly affects ligands that bind Mn. The effects of EDC and DEPC that influence the high-affinity site are mutually exclusive and are specific to the lumenal side of the PS II membrane. Removal of the two more loosely bound of the four functional Mn from PS II membranes uncovers that part of the high-affinity site associated with carboxyl but not histidyl residues. We suggest that carboxyl residues on reaction center proteins are associated with half of the high-affinity Mn-binding site in PS II and are involved along with histidine residues in binding Mn functional in the O2-evolving process.									56	1	2	0	48	0	59			0006-2960			WOS:A1991GJ47300008	1911747

The main aim of this study was to fabricate an n-n heterojunction photoanode of V2O5/BiVO4 via a facile electrodeposition synthesis method in order to overcome the technical bottlenecks encountered in conventional singular photoanode structures. Additionally, the synergistic effect of band potentials matching and conductivity difference between BiVO4 and V2O5 were studied using LSV, IMPS, EIS, HR-TEM, XRD, XPS, Raman and ultraviolet-visible spectroscopies. This was followed by the performance evaluation of the light-induced water splitting using a standard three-electrode assembly PEC cell under 1.5 AM solar simulator. Results showed that the V2O5/BiVO4 heterojunction photoanode achieved a significantly improved photocurrent density of 1.53 mA/cm(2) at 1.5 V vs Ag/AgCl, which was a 6.9-fold and a 7.3-fold improvement over the individual pristine BiVO4 (0.22 mA/cm(2)) and V2O5 (0.21 mA/cm(2)), respectively. The improvement was attributed to the lower charge resistances at the FTO/semiconductor, semiconductor/FTO and semiconductor/electrolyte interfaces as well as the fast transit time (tau) of 6.4 ms for photo-injected electrons in the V2O5/BiVO4 heterojunction photoanode. Finally, the experimental results were used to reconstruct a theoretical band diagram in validating the heterojunction alignment between V2O5 and BiVO4 as well as in elucidating the photogenerated charge carriers transfer mechanism in the V2O5/BiVO4 heterojunction photoanode.									55	2	0	0	8	0	55			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000458504800019		
J	Goodall, CP; Bender, RC; Broderick, EJ; Bayne, CJ								Constitutive differences in Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase mRNA levels and activity in hernocytes of Biomphalaria glabrata (Mollusca) that are either susceptible or resistant to Schistosoma mansoni (Trematoda)								MOLECULAR AND BIOCHEMICAL PARASITOLOGY				137	2			321	328		10.1016/j.molbiopara.2004.06.011				OCT 2004	2004	Genetic strains of the snail Biomphalaria glabrata vary in their resistance to the parasite Schistosoma mansoni. Phagocytic cells (hemocytes) circulating in the hemolymph of B. glabrata play an essential role in the snail's innate immune response. Hemocytes of resistant B. glabrata kill S. mansoni in vitro via a mechanism which involves a respiratory burst. Reactive oxygen species (ROS), which are products of the respiratory burst, can act as mediators of both oxidative damage and of immune-related intracellular signaling pathways. One specific ROS, hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), has been shown to be involved in hemocyte-mediated sporocyst killing. We tested the hypothesis that Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase (SOD), a cytosolic enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of superoxide anion to H2O2, is somehow different between resistant and susceptible snail strains. We report a hemocyte transcript with all the features of a typical cytosolic Cu/Zn SOD (GenBank accession numbers AY505496 and AY505497). The amount of Cu/Zn SOD mRNA in hemocytes from resistant snails was double that of hemocytes from susceptible snails, and this correlated directly with an increased Cu/Zn SOD enzymatic activity in resistant hemocytes. Additional experiments determined that in vitro interaction/encapsulation of sporocysts did not influence Cu/Zn SOD mRNA levels in hemocytes from either snail strain. Thus, resistance in this host-parasite system does not appear to depend on a transcriptional response of hemocyte Cu/Zn SOD, but may be due, at least in part, to a constitutively elevated enzymatic level of Cu/Zn SOD.

In this paper, Ba2+ and Sr2+ ions were successfully employed to synthesize hematite photoanodes with size-controlled nanoparticles using a facile chemical bath deposition method. The synthesized electrodes were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), inductively coupled plasma-optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES), (photo)electro-chemical impedance spectroscopy ((P)EIS), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and intensity modulated photocurrent spectroscopy (IMPS) measurements. It was found that the average diameter of hematite nano particles is decreased by a factor of 13% and 35% by the addition of Ba2+ and Sr2+ ions into the chemical bath, respectively. In agreement with these results, the electroactive surface area of Ba- and Sr-modified hematite electrodes increased by 2.4 and 3.2 times, respectively, in comparison with that of bare hematite. The photo electro-chemical measurements under the standard illumination conditions revealed that the generated photo current at 1.23 V vs. RHE on Ba- and Sr-modified hematite photoanodes is 2.6 and 3 times higher than that of bare hematite, respectively. Moreover, the photocurrent onset potential for water oxidation on Ba- and Sr-modified hematite photoanodes was shifted cathodically by about 150 and 220 mV, respectively. Based on these results, a good correlation between the photocurrent and the electroactive surface area was observed at high bias potential (i.e., 1.23 V vs. RHE) evincing that the photocurrent enhancement can be readily attributed to the enhanced electroactive surface area. The cathodic shift in the photocurrent onset potential of water oxidation was elucidated, however, by the higher density of surface states and the higher rate constant of charge transfer as proven by the PEIS and IMPS measurements, respectively.									28	1	0	0	0	0	28			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000437965900012

No differences in either the time postexposure at which shedding began or the percentage of snails shedding cercariae were detected between interleukin-1 injected, heat-inactivated interleukin-1 injected, or sham injected controls. However, sham injected and heat-inactivated interleukin-1 injected snails maintained significantly higher (approximately three-fold) levels of cercarial production compared to interleukin-l injected snails over 8 weeks of cercarial shedding. Injection of interleukin-l into schistosome-susceptible (M-line) and resistant (13-16-R1) strains of B. glabrata increased hemocyte phagocytosis of target particles and phagocytosis stimulated O-2(-) production in both snail strains at 24 hr postexposure to the parasite. Resistant 13-16-R1 snails maintained, on average, 2.4 times the number of O-2(-) producing phagocytic cells than did M-line susceptible snails, indicating that the incomplete abrogation of cercarial shedding in M-line snails may be due to an inadequate number of activated circulating effector cells in these snails. These data strongly support the contention that the evolutionarily conserved cytokine, interleukin-l, or a molecule in snail plasma with interleukin-1-like immunospecificity, biological activity, and function plays a significant role in the maintenance of susceptibility or resistance to S. mansoni infection in B. glabrata. Finally, these data also supply evidence for the evolutionary conservation of the function and role of interleukin-1, O-2(-) and antioxidant defense mechanisms in this host-parasite relationship.

In upper crustal settings, igneous rocks are often altered by hydrothermal fluids such that the original textures and compositions of igneous magnetite may be partly or completely obliterated, posing interpretive problems in petrological and geochemical studies. In this paper, we present textural and compositional data of magnetite from variably albitized granitoid rocks in the Handan-Xingtai district, North China Craton to characterize the hydrothermal reequilibration of igneous magnetite.Four types of magnetite have been identified in the samples studied: pristine igneous magnetite (type 1), reequilibrated porous magnetite (type 2), reequilibrated nonporous magnetite (type 3), and hydrothermal magnetite (type 4). Pristine igneous magnetite contains abundant well-developed ilmenite exsolution lamellae that are largely replaced by titanite during subsequent hydrothermal alteration. The titanite has a larger molar volume than its precursor ilmenite and thus causes micro-fractures in the host magnetite grains, facilitating dissolution and reprecipitation of magnetite. During sodic alteration, the igneous magnetite is extensively replaced by type 2 and type 3 magnetite via fluid-induced dissolution and reprecipitation. Porous type 2 magnetite is the initial replacement product of igneous magnetite and is subsequently replaced by the nonoporous type 3 variety as its surface area is reduced and compositional equilibrium with the altering fluid is achieved. Hydrothermal type 4 magnetite is generally euhedral and lacks exsolution lamellae and porosity, and is interpreted to precipitate directly from the ore-forming fluids.Hydrothermal reequilibration of igneous magnetite has led to progressive chemical purification, during which trace elements such as Ti, Al, Mg, Zn, and Cr contents decrease dramatically (up to 2-3 orders of magnitude different), coupled with significant increase in iron concentrations from less than 64 wt.% to higher than 70 wt.%. Results presented here show that magnetite is much more susceptible to textural and compositional reequilibration than previously thought. The reequilibrated magnetite has geochemical patterns that may be distinctively different from its precursor, making existing discrimination plots questionable when applied to genetic interpretation. Based on textural characterization and high-resolution in situ compositional analyses, we propose that the Fe versus V/Ti diagram can be more confidently used to discriminate between pristine igneous magnetite, reequilibrated magnetite, and hydrothermal magnetite.

Chemical composition of the extremely metal-poor dwarfs in the binary CS 22876-032								ASTRONOMY & ASTROPHYSICS				480	1			233	U85		10.1051/0004-6361:20078847				MAR 2008	2008	Context. Unevolved metal-poor stars constitute a fossil record of the early Galaxy, and can provide invaluable information on the properties of the first generations of stars. Binary systems also provide direct information on the stellar masses of their member stars.Aims. The purpose of this investigation is a detailed abundance study of the double-lined spectroscopic binary CS 22876-032, which comprises the two most metal-poor dwarfs known.Methods. We used high-resolution, high-S/N ratio spectra from the UVES spectrograph at the ESO VLT telescope. Long-term radial-velocity measurements and broad-band photometry allowed us to determine improved orbital elements and stellar parameters for both components. We used OSMARCS 1D models and the TURBOSPECTRUM spectral synthesis code to determine the abundances of Li, O, Na, Mg, Al, Si, Ca, Sc, Ti, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co and Ni. We also used the (COBOLD)-B-5 model atmosphere code to compute the 3D abundance corrections, notably for Li and O.Results. We find a metallicity of [Fe/H] similar to -3.6 for both stars, using 1D models with 3D corrections of similar to -0.1 dex from averaged 3D models. We determine the oxygen abundance from the near-UV OH bands; the 3D corrections are large, -1 and -1.5 dex for the secondary and primary respectively, and yield [O/Fe] similar to 0.8, close to the high-quality results obtained from the [OI] 630 nm line in metal-poor giants. Other [alpha/Fe] ratios are consistent with those measured in other dwarfs and giants with similar [Fe/H], although Ca and Si are somewhat low ([X/Fe] less than or similar to 0). Other element ratios follow those of other halo stars. The Li abundance of the primary star is consistent with the Spite plateau, but the secondary shows a lower abundance; 3D corrections are small.Conclusions. The Li abundance in the primary star supports the extension of the Spite Plateau value at the lowest metallicities, without any decrease. The low abundance in the secondary star could be explained by endogenic Li depletion, due to its cooler temperature. If this is not the case, another, yet unknown mechanism may be causing increased scatter in A( Li) at the lowest metallicities.									57	2	0	0	0	0	57			1432-0746			WOS:000253576400028

The Mn X-ray absorption K-edge spectra of the S-2-g4 state not only show a shift of the inflection point to higher energy from the S-1 state but also reveal a different edge shape from that of the S-2 state with the multiline signal (S-2-MLS state). Extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) studies of the Mn K-edge show that the structure of the Mn cluster in the S-2-g4 state is distinctly different from those in the S-2-MLS or S-1 states. In the S-2-g4 state, the second shell of back-scatterers from the Mn absorber is found to contain two Mn-Mn distances of 2.73 and 2.85 Angstrom. We interpret this to indicate the presence of two nonequivalent di-mu-oxo-bridged Mn binuclear structures in the Mn cluster of the S-2-g4 state. The third shell of the S-2-g4 state at about 3.3 Angstrom also contains increased heterogeneity. By contrast, very little distance disorder was found to exist in the second shell of the S-1 or S-2-MLS states. A mechanism is proposed to explain these results in the context of our model for the Mn cluster and the EPR properties of the Mn complex in the S-2 state.									64	0	0	0	25	0	64			0006-2960			WOS:A1994NH63300022	8161553

For practical applications, the power production of MFCs needs to be enhanced and the use of novel anode and cathode catalyst can certainly help in this regard. Such a novel catalyst, WO3, was explored as both anode and cathode catalyst in this study. Performance of MFCs was enhanced when WO(3)was used as an electrocatalyst. The maximum power density of MFC was increased by five times when WO(3)was used as anode catalyst and by four times when it was used as cathode catalyst as compared to control MFC using electrode without any catalyst. Almost six times increment in maximum power production of MFC was observed when WO(3)was used as catalyst on both the electrodes. Electrochemical analysis of WO(3)also proved that it could enhance the current density of the modified electrode owing to its electrochemical catalytic properties. Furthermore, chemical oxygen demand (COD) removal of MFC having WO(3)coated electrodes was also observed to be higher, thus suggesting an overall enhancement in the performance of MFC by the use of WO(3)as an electrocatalyst.									26	0	0	0	7	0	27			0959-3330	1479-487X		WOS:000547392500010	30681908

[O I] lambda 6300 and lines of [Ca II] and Na I, as well as some Fe II optical forbidden and permitted lines are present at visual wavelengths. Also present are a number of weak emission features, which are presumably metal lines produced by photon degradation as a result of reprocessing of UV radiation into metal lines. Modeling the Mg II-Mg I lines provides the velocity of the outer visible radius of the envelope, 9000 +/- 500 km s(-1) in the Mg II lambda 2800 line, which is consistent with the earlier direct HST imaging at near-UV wavelengths. The UV/optical emission lines originate from the radioactive luminescence of the cool gas (T approximate to 130-160 K). The metal lines reflect the instantaneous reprocessing of the energy deposited from Ti-44 radioactive decays through collisions with fast electrons, while the H alpha emission primarily comes from the recombination of previously ionized hydrogen. The overall luminosity of the Fe II emission lines, similar to 10(35) ergs s(-1), can be explained if the bulk of the positrons from a mass (1-2) x 10(-4) M. of Ti-44 release their energy in the iron-rich material, which suggests the presence of a magnetic field B > 5 x 10(-13) G prohibiting the escape of positrons into oxygen and hydrogen gas. The ionized fraction in the iron-rich material is small (0.2-0.3), and the total UV/optical emission from Fe I should be comparable to that from Fe II. Most of the 10(36) ergs s(-1) deposited by the Ti-44 positions Should be emitted in the Fe II 26 mu m Line. The observed H alpha luminosity decrease, by 5 orders of magnitude between the ages of 1 to 8 yr, is reproduced in a time-dependent model of ionization and cooling with the ''standard'' amount of radioactive nuclides. However, an additional source of energy at the present epoch with a deposition rate 30 ergs s(-1) g(-1) (approximate to 10(36) ergs s(-1) in the whole envelope) is not ruled out. The present average temperature in the hydrogen envelope predicted by the time-dependent model is 130 K, which is lower than the value T approximate to 350 K obtained from the observed Balmer continuum shape. However, the shape is affected by a possible contribution of metal lines to the Balmer continuum. The luminosity of the [O I] lambda 6300 doublet is consistent with that expected for the deposited energy of gamma-rays from (1-2) x 10(-4) M. of Ti-44 for an for the amount of Ti-44 in SN 1987A. The maximum fraction of the Ti-44 positron energy deposited into oxygen-rich material does not exceed 5%, which is consistent with positron trapping in Fe-rich material. The [O I] lambda 6300 line intensity rules out the presence of a central source of gamma-radiation (hv > 100 keV) with a luminosity L-gamma > 4 x 10(36) ergs s(-1).									43	0	0	0	3	0	43			0004-637X			WOS:A1997XL75900037

In this study, the SaGAPDH gene was cloned from Spartina alterniflora based on the full-length cDNA library. The open reading frame of SaGAPDH was 1014bp, and it was encoding 337 amino acids with a calculated molecular mass of 36.40kDa. Multiple sequence alignment showed that SaGAPDH had high amino acid sequence identity with other plant GAPDHs, and phylogenetic analysis demonstrated that SaGAPDH had a closer affinity to GAPDH in Aeluropus lagopoides (AlGAPDH). Subcellular localization suggested that SaGAPDH was located in cytosol. The recombinant SaGAPDH protein was expressed in Escherichia coli cells to characterize its catalytic activity. And E. coli carrying SaGAPDH gene showed an increased salt stress resistance. SaGAPDH gene was induced by salt stress, and to further investigate its function, transgenic Arabidopsis plants ectopically antisense-overexpressing SaGAPDH was generated. The transgenic Arabidopsis plants showed a specific down-regulation of AtGAPC1 transcript and the GAPDH enzyme activity. They also showed decreased tolerance to salt stress and down-regulation of antioxidant enzymes including catalase, ascorbate peroxidase, superoxide dismutase, and peroxidase, as well as their transcripts. Above results were further confirmed by the aggravation of oxidative damage in SaGAPDH antisense-overexpressing transgenic Arabidopsis lines, which accumulated more reactive oxygen species (ROS) such as superoxide anion (O-) and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) under salt stress. This study indicated that SaGAPDH may play an important role in response to salt stress by the regulation of redox homeostasis.									4	0	0	0	2	0	4			0137-5881	1861-1664		WOS:000472134100001

Data analysis and results								ASTRONOMY & ASTROPHYSICS				356	1			238	252						APR 2000	2000	We present the results of the analysis of an extensive set of new and literature high quality data concerning Fe, C, N, O, Na, and Mg. This analysis exploited the T-eff scale determined in Gratton et al. (1996a), and the non-LTE abundance corrections computed in Gratton et al. (1999a). Results obtained with various abundance indices are discussed and compared. Derailed comparison with models of galactic chemical evolution will be presented in future papers of this series.Our non-LTE analysis yields the same O abundances from both permitted and forbidden lines for stars with T-eff >4600 K, in agree ment with King (1993), but not with other studies using a lower T-eff -scale for subdwarfs. However, we obtain slightly smaller O abundances for the most luminous metal-poor field stars than for fainter stars of similar metallicities, an effect attributed to inadequacies of the adopted model atmospheres (Kurucz 1992, with overshooting) for cool stars. We find a nearly constant O overundance in metal-poor stars ([Fe/H]< -9.8), at a mean value of 0.46 +/- 0.02 dex(sigma = 0.12, 32 stars), with only a gentle slope with [Fe/H] (similar to -0.1); this result is different from the steeper slope recently obtained using OH band in the near UV.If only bonafide unmixed stars are considered, C abundances scale with Fe ones (i.e. [C/Fe]approximate to 0) down to [Fe/H]similar to -2.5. Due to our adoption of a different T-eff scale, we do not confirm the slight C excess in the most metal poor disk dwarfs (- 0.8 <[Fe/H]< -0.4) found in previous investigations.Na abundances scale as Fe ones in the high metallicity regime? while metal-poor stars present a Na underabundance. None of the field stars analyzed belong to the group of O-poor and Na-rich stars observed in globular clusters. Na is deficient with respect to ME in halo and thick disk stars; within these populations, Na deficiency may be a slow function of [Mg/H]. Salar [Na/Mg] ratios are obtained for thin disk stars.									137	1	1	0	0	0	138			0004-6361			WOS:000086869300037		
J	De Falco, G.; Bocchicchio, S.; Commodo, M.; Minutolo, P.; D'Anna, A.								Raman Spectroscopy of Nascent Soot Oxidation: Structural Analysis During Heating								FRONTIERS IN ENERGY RESEARCH				10						878171	10.3389/fenrg.2022.878171				JUN 1 2022	2022	The effect of oxidation on nascent soot particles is investigated in this work by means of Raman spectroscopy. Three different soot particle samples are produced in a lightly sooting ethylene/air laminar premixed flame and collected at different residence times. The samples are characterized by a different size of primary particles and a different degree of aging and hence graphitization, and they are representative of the early evolution of nascent soot in flames. Oxidation of particles is induced by exposing the samples to a high temperature oxidation treatment in air over a range of temperature 25-500 degrees C. To this aim, a programmable heating microscope stage is used. Thermo-optical transmission (TOT) measurements are used to characterize the chemical composition of pristine particles in terms of organic and elemental carbon content, also providing the pyrolytic carbon fraction of the organic carbon. The TOT results show that the organic fraction is constant for the three conditions. On the other hand, the pyrolytic carbon fraction decreases and the elemental carbon increases when moving from the sample composed of just-nucleated particles to the sample mostly made of mature soot particles. Raman spectroscopy reveals that the thermal oxidation treatment performed on the sample of just-nucleated particles, with the highest organic carbon content, results in a reduction of the amorphous carbon component. Conversely, the sample of mature soot, with the highest elemental carbon content, shows an increase in the amorphous carbon phase after oxidation, which is attributed to fragmentation or the formation of point defects by O-2 oxidation. Finally, the thermal oxidation procedure produces a strong reduction in the photoluminescence signal detected from Raman spectra.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			2296-598X			WOS:000811678000001		
J	Wei, Haiqiao; Zhao, Jianfu; Zhou, Lei; Gao, Dongzhi; Xu, Zailong								Effects of the equivalence ratio on turbulent flame-shock interactions in a confined space								COMBUSTION AND FLAME				186				247	262		10.1016/j.combustflame.2017.08.009				DEC 2017	2017	In this work, the influences of the equivalence ratio on flame front propagation velocity, shock wave velocity and pressure oscillation as well as flame-shock interactions with different combustion phenomena were comprehensively studied experimentally in a newly designed constant volume combustion bomb (CVCB). And a hydrogen-air mixture was chosen as the test fuel. In the CVCB, an orifice plate was used to obtain flame acceleration and promote turbulent flame formation. High-speed Schlieren photography was employed to capture the turbulent flame front and shock wave in the present work. The evolution of the flame and shock wave together with influences of the equivalence ratio on the flame tip velocity, shock wave velocity and pressure oscillation were clearly presented. The results showed that, after the laminar flame passed through the orifice plate, wrinkled turbulent flame gradually formed, and the shock wave ahead of flame front could be seen at a certain condition. The shock wave formation and enhancement process induced by flame acceleration was clearly captured by the Schlieren photography. It was found that the mean turbulent flame tip velocity reached a maximum value at an equivalence ratio of 1.25. In addition, an increase in the initial ambient pressure resulted in an increase of the turbulent flame tip velocity. Forced by the flame-shock/acoustic interactions, the flame would reverse and the backward flame velocity was positively related to that of the forward flame. The forward shock wave showed little differences among different equivalence ratios, while the reflected shock decayed fastest for the fastest flame, and the turbulent flame was pushed back more apparently. And the effect of the equivalence ratio on the pressure oscillation caused by flame acceleration and flame-shock interactions in the end gas region of confined space was determined.

It is thought to result from the disruption or deafferentation of the Visual Word Form Area (VWFA), a region in the left lateral occipitotemporal sulcus activated whenever normal subjects are viewing alphabetic strings. Most pure alexic patients retain the ability to identify single letters, and develop a strategy of letter-by-letter (LBL) reading. We recently studied fMRI activations in LBL readers and clarified the underlying mechanisms. However, LBL reading is a dynamic process which may improve over months or years of practice, although the cerebral bases of this continuing improvement are currently unknown. We had the opportunity to run the same behavioural testing and fMRI experiment a second time in an alexic patient, 8 months after collecting the data reported by Cohen et al. [Cohen, L., Henry, C., Dehaene, S., Molko, N., Lehericy, S., Martinaud, O., Lemer, C., & Ferrieux, S. (2004). The pathophysiology of letter-by-letter reading. Neuropsychologia, 42, 1768-1780]. We analyze the changes that occurred over this period in the pattern of reading-related activations, while the patient's LBL reading improved. The activation level decreased in most of the overall network between the two sessions. This general trend contrasted with a focal increase restricted to specific left frontal and parietal areas. When studying the contrast between words and consonant strings, which may be taken as a correlate of LBL reading, we also found a general decrease, except for similar left frontal and parietal regions, which showed a significant increase. We suggest that the pattern of evolution fits with the minimal hypothesis of normal strategic abilities and skill learning, associated with perceptual tuning in right-hemispheric structures able to substitute the disrupted VWFA.

With CdS working as a visible light absorbent, HCa2Nb3O10, with a wide bandgap, showed H-2 evolution activity without cocatalysts upon visible light excitation and neutral pH (450 mu mol h(-1) g(cat)(-1)), and showed a high quantum efficiency of 7.2% at 425 nm because of enhanced charge separation. The self-assembly method rapidly realized introduction of guest materials into the interlayer space of layered perovskites from a layer-bylayer strategy, showing great potential in synthesizing novel 2D material based hybrid photocatalyst. A type II composite band structure was obtained from combination of CdS and niobates, making it possible for spontaneous charge separation. While ultra-fine nature of the guest CdS, ultra-thin nature of the host niobate nanosheets and close junction between the host and guest components facilitated charge transfer between components. Enhanced charge separation in hybrid photocatalyst is the key factor that leads to its superior photocatalytic performance in comparison with its components. This work extends photocatalytic application of wide gap niobates into visible light region. Since the unique nanostrucute and charged nature of 2D materials can be fully utilized, it is believable that more efficient photocatalytic water splitting can be realized by constructing nanosheets based hybrids in the future.									16	1	0	0	0	0	16			0920-5861	1873-4308		WOS:000438466000014

However, tuning the morphology and surface composition of binary metal sulfides in a facile way is still a challenge. Herein, binary Fe-Ni sulfides supported on nickel foam (FeNi-S/NF) with different morphology and composition ratio of Fe/Ni have been synthesized through a facile one-step electrodeposition assisted by liquid crystal template (LCT). The binary FeNi-S has improved activity and conductivity compared to single metal sulfides. LCT-assisted porous FeNi-S film composed of uniform nanospheres is obviously different from planar film electrodeposited in water solution. LCT-assisted FeNi-S nanospheres are covered by many interwoven nanosheets, implying more exposed active sites for water splitting. Furthermore, the different Fe/Ni ratios of FeNi-S/NF samples have been systematically studied to explore the influence of Fe-incorporation on intrinsic activity of FeNi-S/NF. And the sample with Fe/Ni ratio (3/1) demonstrates the best activity and excellent stability for overall water electrolysis. Therefore, our work provides a facile and controllable access to binary metal sulfides with excellent performances for overall water splitting. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc.

Herein, we develop a general synthesis strategy for controlling the sizes of ultrafine metal nanoparticles using a single metal ion trap based on metal-organic frameworks (MOFs). By grafting ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) onto the inorganic nodes of MOF-808 by a solvent-assisted ligand exchange method, the post-synthesized MOF-based single metal ion trap (MOF-808-EDTA) materials can capture single Pt2+ ions at EDTA sites, while uncaptured Pt2+ ions will form various sizes of PtO2 nanoclusters inside MOF-808-EDTA pores as precursors. Upon pyrolysis, the sizes of ultrafine Pt nanoparticles can be effectively controlled in the range of 2.1-4.1 nm by adjusting the Pt2+ ion concentrations via both migration/coalescence and Ostwald ripening aggregation mechanisms. With the atomically distributed metal species precursors in the MOF materials, stable and size-controllable ultrafine metal nanoparticles can be prepared. Compared with commercial Pt/C (20 wt% Pt), the Pt nanoparticles with a size of 4.1 nm not only exhibit a lower overpotential of 42.1 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) and a Tafel slope of 24.45 mV dec(-1) but also have a higher stability although they have a lower amount of Pt (9.58 wt%). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report on catalysts synthesized with only a single Pt component rather than alloys, having better HER performance than the commercial Pt/C catalyst. Using the same method, other ultrafine metal nanoparticles such as Pd, Ru, and Rh with controllable sizes have also been successfully synthesized. This indicates that the single metal ion trap MOF-based materials proposed in this work have great potential to serve as a general synthesis platform for preparing stable ultrafine metal catalysts with controllable sizes.									16	0	0	0	3	0	16			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000489686400016		
J	Burnap, RL								D1 protein processing and Mn cluster assembly in light of the emerging Photosystem II structure								PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY CHEMICAL PHYSICS				6	20			4803	4809		10.1039/b407094a				2004	2004	The formation of the (Mn-4-Ca) center of the water oxidation complex (WOC) of Photosystem II (PSII) occurs via a complex post-translational assembly pathway involving the proteolytic processing of the D1 protein precursor and the light-driven assembly, termed photoactivation, of the (Mn-4-Ca). Photoactivation consists of a sequence of light-activated steps, involving Mn oxidation, separated by 'dark' molecular rearrangements, which are necessary for creating the coordination environment for the incoming metals. Initially, only one high affinity Mn binding site exists in the apo-WOC, whereas the remaining metal binding sites are created during the photoactivation process. Although much progress has been made in defining these processes, the molecular details remain obscure. Recently, X-ray crystallographic analyses have begun to reveal the molecular structure of PSII raising the possibility of formulating tentative structure-based mechanisms for the proteolytic processing and (Mn-4-Ca) photoassembly events. Here an attempt is made to review and assemble the current kinetic and structural data to begin to develop a plausible molecular model for the assembly of the (Mn-4-Ca) with particular emphasis placed on the proteolytic processing of the D1 protein precursor and the nature of 'dark' rearrangements occurring on the assembly of the (Mn-4-Ca).									61	0	0	0	44	0	61			1463-9076			WOS:000224755500010

We analyzed the expression of the genes encoding terminal oxidases and some respiratory components of DSS12 under various growth conditions. The expression of some of the genes during growth was regulated by both the O-2 concentration and hydrostatic pressure. Additionally, the activities of cytochrome c oxidase and quinol oxidase of the membrane fraction of DSS12 grown under various conditions were measured under high pressure. The piezotolerance of cytochrome c oxidase activity was dependent on the O-2 concentration during growth, while that of quinol oxidase was influenced by pressure during growth. The activity of quinol oxidase was more piezotolerant than that of cytochrome c oxidase under all growth conditions. Even in the membranes of the non-piezophile Shewanella amazonensis, quinol oxidase was more piezotolerant than cytochrome c oxidase, although both were highly piezosensitive as compared to the activities in DSS12. By phylogenetic analysis, piezophile-specific cytochrome c oxidase, which is also found in the genome of DSS12, was identified in piezophilic Shewanella and related genera. Our observations suggest that DSS12 constitutively expresses piezotolerant respiratory terminal oxidases, and that lower O-2 concentrations and higher hydrostatic pressures induce higher piezotolerance in both types of terminal oxidases. Quinol oxidase might be the dominant terminal oxidase in high-pressure environments, while cytochrome c oxidase might also contribute. These features should contribute to adaptation of DSS12 in deep-sea environments.									8	2	0	0	7	0	9			0916-8451	1347-6947		WOS:000323533800028	23832349	
J	Diehl, S. F.; Hofstra, A. H.; Koenig, A. E.; Emsbo, P.; Christiansen, W.; Johnson, C.								Hydrothermal Zebra Dolomite in the Great Basin, Nevada-Attributes and Relation to Paleozoic Stratigraphy, Tectonics, and Ore Deposits								GEOSPHERE				6	5			663	690		10.1130/GES00530.1				OCT 2010	2010	In other parts of the world, previous workers have shown that sparry dolomite in carbonate rocks may be produced by the generation and movement of hot basinal brines in response to arid paleoclimates and tectonism, and that some of these brines served as the transport medium for metals fixed in Mississippi Valley-type (MVT) and sedimentary exhalative (Sedex) deposits of Zn, Pb, Ag, Au, or barite.Numerous occurrences of hydrothermal zebra dolomite (HZD), comprised of alternating layers of dark replacement and light void-filling sparry or saddle dolomite, are present in Paleozoic platform and slope carbonate rocks on the eastern side of the Great Basin physiographic province. Locally, it is associated with mineral deposits of barite, Ag-Pb-Zn, and Au. In this paper the spatial distribution of HZD occurrences, their stratigraphic position, morphological characteristics, textures and zoning, and chemical and stable isotopic compositions were determined to improve understanding of their age, origin, and relation to dolostone, ore deposits, and the tectonic evolution of the Great Basin.In northern and central Nevada, HZD is coeval and cogenetic with Late Devonian and Early Mississippian Sedex Au, Zn, and barite deposits and may be related to Late Ordovician Sedex barite deposits. In southern Nevada and southwest California, it is cogenetic with small MVT Ag-Pb-Zn deposits in rocks as young as Early Mississippian. Over Paleozoic time, the Great Basin was at equatorial paleolatitudes with episodes of arid paleoclimates. Several occurrences of HZD are crosscut by Mesozoic or Cenozoic intrusions, and some host younger pluton-related polymetallic replacement and Carlin-type gold deposits.The distribution of HZD in space (carbonate platform, margin, and slope) and stratigraphy (Late Neoproterozoic Ediacaran-Mississippian) roughly parallels that of dolostone and both are prevalent in Devonian strata. Stratabound HZD is best developed in Ediacaran and Cambrian units, whereas discordant HZD is proximal to high-angle structures at the carbonate platform margin, such as strike-slip and growth faults and dilational jogs. Fabric-selective replacement and dissolution features (e.g., collapse breccias, voids with geopetal textures) are common, with remaining void space lined with light-colored dolomite crystals that exhibit zoning under cathodoluminescence. Zoned crystals usually contain tiny (<1-3 mu m) fluid inclusions with vapor bubbles, requiring Th > similar to 70 degrees C. The oxygen isotopic compositions of HZD are consistent with formation temperatures of 50-150 degrees C requiring brine circulation to depths of 2-5 km, or more. The few HZD occurrences with the highest concentrations of metals (especially Fe, Mn, and Zn) and the largest isotopic shifts are closely associated with Sedex or MVT deposits known to have formed from hotter brines (e. g., Th > 150-250 degrees C).These relationships permit that HZD formed at about the same time as dolostone, from brines produced by the evaporation of seawater during arid paleoclimates at equatorial paleolatitudes. Both dolostone and HZD may have formed as basinal brines, which migrated seaward from evaporative pans on the platform, with dolostone forming at low temperatures along shallow migration pathways through permeable limestones, and HZD forming at high temperatures along deeper migration pathways through basal aquifers and dilatant high-angle faults. The small MVT deposits were chemical traps where hot brines encountered rocks or fluids containing reduced sulfur. The abundant Sedex deposits mark sites where hot brine discharged at the seafloor in adjacent basins. Thus the distribution of HZD may map deep migration pathways and upflow zones between eastern shallow marine facies, where evaporative brine could have been generated, and western Sedex deposits, where heated brines discharged along faults into platform margin, slope, and basin facies. The small size and scarcity of Pb-Zn deposits and the abundance of barite deposits in the Great Basin suggests the brines were generally reduced, possibly due to reactions with carbonaceous rocks along deep migration pathways. While this scenario may have occurred at several times, the age and abundance of Sedex deposits suggest that such a hydrology was best developed in the Late Ordovician, Late Devonian, and Early Mississippian, possibly in response to episodes of extension and forebulge faults associated with the Antler orogeny. The improved understanding of HZD may aid future exploration for ore deposits in the Great Basin.									27	7	0	0	1	0	33			1553-040X			WOS:000282709700014

The gold nanocrystal-decorated MoS2 nanosheets facilitate sufficiently enhanced photoelectrochemical water splitting in the UV-visible region. Different Au nanostructures, such as Au nanoparticles and nanorods, were modified on the surface of MoS2 nanosheets to promote photoelectrochemical water decomposition. By spin-coating a synthetic gold-modified MoS2 hybrid photoanode on a FTO substrate, the efficiency of photoelectrochemical water oxidation was significantly enhanced, by 2 times (nanorods) and 3.5 times (nanoparticles) in the visible-infrared region; furthermore, the average optical resistance was reduced by a factor of two compared to the MoS2 photoanode without Au, and the photocurrent increases exponentially when the system bias was greater than 0.7 volts. The Au-MoS2 metal-semiconductor interface plays an important role in studying the surface plasmon interactions, charge transfer mechanism, and electric field amplification. This rational design for such a unique hybrid nanostructure explains the plasmon-enhanced photoelectrochemical water splitting. This current contribution provides a new path for using the plasmonic metal/semiconductor heterostructure to effectively harvest UV-visible light for solar fuel generation.									35	2	0	0	1	0	35			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000467776400028	30958488	
J	Zhu, Chao; Xia, Shu-Hong; Wang, Bao-li; Qu, Dong								Variation of Anaeromyxobacter community structure and abundance in paddy soil slurry over flooding time								AFRICAN JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL RESEARCH				6	28			6107	6118		10.5897/AJAR11.1159				NOV 26 2011	2011	Cultivation-independent techniques like PCR-amplified restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) of 16S rRNA genes and real-time PCR were applied to assess the abundance, diversity and phylogenetic composition of Anaeromyxobacter communities over time in flooded, unplanted paddy soil slurries. Six Anaeromyxobacter communities were sampled from anoxic slurries at 1 h, and 1, 5, 10, 20 and 30 days while the Fe (II) concentrations were measured also. Bacterial Genomic DNA was extracted and PCR-amplified to obtain 16S rDNA fragments of Anaeromyxobacter which were cloned to construct 6 16s rDNA libraries. Eventually 10 major Anaeromyxobacter types were identified by RFLP fingerprintings. Results showed that the optimal increasing phase of Fe (II) was from 1h to nearly 10 days, being correspond with the growth phase of the abundance of Anaeromyxobacter. The highest diversity appeared in slurry at 30 days and the lowest was found at 30 days. Jackknife Environment Clusters by UniFrac showed that phylogenetic compositions of Anaeromyxobacter communities in slurries at 10 and 20 days were the most similar. By evolutionary distance analysis, our 10 major Anaeromyxobacter types were diverged into Group 1 and 2 in phylogenetic tree, while Group 1 was the exclusive collection of clones from our experiment. Major type P1 was present in all slurries abundantly and P9 only existed in slurry at 5 days. The abundance of Anaeromyxobacter spp., calculated as its proportion of 16S rDNA copies to the value of total Bacteria, was from 0.242% at 1 h to 5.135% at 10 days. We demonstrated that flooding time led to successional dynamics of major types and variable abundance of Anaeromyxobacter community. Flooding time also influenced the diversity of Anaeromyxobacter community on some extent. Canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) revealed that Anaeromyxobacteria spp. abundance had interrelation with Fe (II) content and the influenced the distribution of the slurries in the Biplot. Moreover, our study provides valuable information for the further isolation of Anaeromyxobacter strains from paddies.									9	0	0	0	9	0	9			1991-637X			WOS:000298505500014

A full understanding of the radiolytic formation and devolution of organic matter is essential to appreciate the budget of organic chemicals that exist in cometary and interstellar ices, carbonaceous meteorites, and to understand the results of analyses of irradiated extraterrestrial organic matter, such as that in cometary nuclei. The effects of ionising radiation on a set of 10 naturally occurring, terrestrial organic assemblages have been revealed by pyrolysis-gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (Py-GC-MS), carbon isotopic analysis, and stepped combustion-isotope ratio mass spectrometry (SC-IRMS). Progressive radiolytic alteration of biogenic complex-hydrocarbon mixtures induces a decrease in the average size and extent of alkylation of polyaromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) and an increase in the abundance of oxygen-containing compounds, as indicated by Py-GC-MS, and an enrichment in C-13. These changes are attributed to reactions with free radicals, produced by ionising radiation. In contrast, the progressive radiolytic alteration of bitumens proposed to have derived from the radiolytic polymerisation of methane into an organic solid produces, upon pyrolysis, PAH of increasing average size and degree of alkylation. This, the opposite of the trend observed in the irradiated complex-hydrocarbons mixtures, cannot be explained in terms of the radiolytic alteration of a pre-existing array of complex organic molecules. Instead, it suggests the gradual construction of PAH from smaller molecules, supporting the hypothesis of a methane origin. Radiolytic alteration is also associated with a previously unrecognised increase in the mean combustion temperature of organic matter. This leads to predictions regarding the combustion characteristics of the irradiated organic matter present on cometary nuclei. A full understanding of the relationship between the combustion characteristics of organic polymers, radiation dose and the atomic H/C ratio should lead to the better design and implementation of in situ extraterrestrial sample analysis hardware and aid the interpretation of data from such missions. This study establishes predictable organic chemical responses of organic matter, upon exposure to ionising radiation. Our results support proposals that extraterrestrial PAH may be formed by the cosmic irradiation of simple hydrocarbons in interstellar ices. Our data may also be relevant to analogous material formed in other hydrocarbon-rich environments, such as the surface and atmosphere of Titan and other icy bodies, such as comets, and to the results of in situ analyses of extraterrestrial organic matter.

This paper describes a facile solution processed p-Si/n-CdS heterojunction for low cost photovoltage generation from commercially available p-Si substrates, which is further covered by a TiO2 layer. The multifunctional TiO2 layer serves as 1) a passivation layer to fix surface defects of CdS to reduces surface carrier recombination; 2) a hole-blocking layer to reflect photogenerated holes to improve charge separation; 3) a protective layer to avoid the corrosion of CdS and Si substrate. The p-Si/nCdS/n-TiO2/Pt photocathode exhibits increased open-circuit voltage (from 49 to 425 mV) and stable H-2 production for 1 h. The surface passivation effect and low valence band position of TiO2 both contribute to the improved photovoltage. The solar-to-hydrogen conversion efficiency reaches 2.07%, which is the highest among all Si heterogeneous p-n junction photocathodes in neutral electrolytes.									46	2	0	0	1	0	46			2211-2855	2211-3282		WOS:000448994600015

Surface science has not been immune to this fascination and has quickly made its contribution to the synthesis and study of the fundamental properties of systems like epitaxial graphene films, nanoribbons, nanopatches, providing a basic knowledge, which has been successfully capitalized upon by technologists and material scientists.Nowadays, the focus of scientists' attention has moved towards more complex systems like chemically modified graphene and 3D systems based on the assembly of graphene sheets. However, despite many successful applications and the synthesis of very different materials, a basic understanding of the phenomena taking place at the atomic level is still missing, as is a clear correlation between structure and properties. Surface science, by virtue of its reductionist approach, can certainly make an important contribution to these new branches of research. Graphene is a perfect candidate for the realization of highly controlled model systems, in which to study the evolution from 2D to 3D topology or the new properties engendered by the substitution of carbon atoms with selected heteroatoms or entire functional groups.Graphene has also proved to be an effective and versatile support: by acting on the nanostructure and defectivity of carbon sheets, it is possible to obtain highly controlled and easily tunable nanoparticles, opening the way to the rational design of new materials, and to the development of quite powerful model systems for heterogeneous catalysis investigations. Finally, graphene has proven to be extremely interesting as an advanced electrode for many electrochemical applications, and the study of the phenomena taking place at the solid-electrolyte interface is of paramount importance. This field could be the perfect context where the newly born discipline, electrochemical surface science, can advance and thrive, demonstrating all its potential. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

X-ray powder diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy and energy dispersive spectroscopy were used to characterize the microstructure, micro-constituents and surface morphology of as-prepared Ni. The microstructure of Ni was strongly affected by the applied overpotential and deposition time. It is demonstrated that by controlling these two parameters either amorphous or cubic crystal structure of Ni on the W substrate could be obtained. The crystallization mechanism is discussed based on Gibbs crystal growth theory and Ostwald's rule. It is concluded that W substrate, acting as a heat sink, can effectively promote the thermal stability of amorphous Ni, based on the data from differential scanning calorimetry and Kissinger's model. This work contributes to the elucidation of the crystallization mechanism of Ni on W powder substrates, and proves that, better than alloying with other elements, incorporating powder substrates will significantly improve the crystallization temperature, hence the thermostability of amorphous Ni.

A systematic study of the corrosion behaviour of this anode was performed under accelerated conditions (j = 400 mA cm(-2)) in acidic media. Simultaneously, CV and EIS measurements were done at regular time intervals until the end of the electrode service life (similar to 528 h). It was possible to identify the various stages of the electrode deactivation, and quantify the associated parameters. Three main steps were identified in the electrode deactivation mechanism. During the first 170 h, the loss of the more external (porous) part of the oxide active layer occurred. This is supported by the decrease in the parameter-values related to the electrochemically active surface area of the anode (q(a) and C-dl) and an increase in the R-ct-values. The second stage is evidenced by a potential step afterwards remaining practically constant up to similar to 380 h, suggesting that the more compact and still very active region of the electrode is now exposed. Finally, for t(cor) > 400 h the anode potential increases again. This behaviour, together with the R-ct against time, suggests that the most internal part of the original coating, less rich in IrO2, is now exposed to the solution and is corroded. For t greater than or equal to similar to 510 h the anode potential increases rapidly, the electrode being totally deactivated at t similar or equal to 528 h, when the anodically grown TiO2 film is exposed to the solution. During the complete deactivation process, the growth of a TiO2 film, due to Ti-support oxidation, in addition to that already present (IrO2 doped TiO2 film formed during the calcination step), is evidenced by the increase in the R-f-values, as well as decreasing C-f-values. However, for t(cor) < 450 h the rate of this process is not significant. Only for t(cor) > 450 h Ti-support oxidation becomes the main feature of the deactivation process.									49	3	0	0	2	1	49			0021-891X			WOS:000077493800005

This is demonstrated by the decrease in metal content (H = similar to 8 vol%, L = similar to 4 vol%, and LL = similar to 2 vol%), and by a positive correlation between Delta O-17 and %Fa through the OC sequence. Compared to other chondrites, OCs exhibit the largest variation in oxidation state, but there is an ongoing debate on the processes that control this variation. To constrain the causes of the variations in the oxidation state with respect to the associated nebular versus parent bodies processes, we investigated the elemental and isotopic variations of germanium (moderately siderophile and volatile) in the bulk sample, as well as in the metal, silicate and sulfide phases, over a range of petrographic types for the H, L, and LL ordinary chondrites.We found that delta Ge-74/70(metal) is a proxy for the delta Ge-74/70(bulk) composition and that each OC group is distinguishable by their delta Ge-74/70(metal), which increases from -0.51 +/- 0.09 parts per thousand for H chondrites, -0.31 +/- 0.06 parts per thousand for L chondrites, and, finally, to -0.26 +/- 0.09 parts per thousand for LL chondrites (2 sigma SD). Additionally, the OC sequence exhibited a positive correlation, from H to L to LL, between delta Ge-74/70(metal) and %Fa, as well as oxygen isotopes (delta O-17, delta O-18 and Delta O-17), that was not a consequence of a "size sorting effect" on chondrules (i.e., chondrule mixing) or metamorphic processes in the parent bodies but, rather, was the result of nebular processes. We propose that the correlation between the delta Ge-74/70 values and %Fa, Delta O-17, delta O-18 can be explained by an increasing proportion of accreted hydrated phyllosilicates, from the H, L to LL groups, with high delta Ge-74/70 and Delta O-17. We found that 10 to 15% of phyllosilicates, with a composition of [Ge] = 4-7 ppm and delta Ge-74/70 = 3-2.5 parts per thousand, is needed to change the delta Ge-74/70 from H to LL, which corresponds to a Delta O-17 approximate to 8-7 parts per thousand. This value agrees with the Delta O-17 approximate to 7 parts per thousand composition of the accreted nebular component reported by Choi et al. (1998). During thermal metamorphism, phyllosilicates destabilize, liberating germanium that will be incorporated in the metal, then leading to its high delta Ge-74/70 signature.High-temperature metamorphism can explain the lack of delta Ge-74/70(metal) variation with the petrologic type in the OC, even for the type 3 chondrites (T approximate to 675 degrees C), implying a complete reaction even at low petrologic types. In addition, metal-silicate re-equilibration in response to thermal metamorphism results in a decrease in Delta Ge-74/70(metal-silicate) from 0.33 parts per thousand to 0.06 parts per thousand, within the H chondrite group, which is interpreted as the result of delta Ge-74/70(silicate) variation. The mean positive Delta Ge-74/70(metal-silicate) fractionation factor of +0.22 +/- 0.36 parts per thousand (error propagation on individual error) also displays a remarkable similarity to the direction of isotopic fractionation with other germanium isotopic metal-silicate datasets, such as the magmatic iron meteorites, the Earth silicate reservoirs. We propose that the Delta Ge-74/70(metal-silicate) and the negative delta Ge-74/70 values of OCs are inherited from metal-silicate melting and partial exchange before planetesimal accretion in a light isotope-enriched gas. Finally, the delta Ge-74/70(metal)-Delta O-17(silicate) correlation between the IIE iron meteorites and OCs, provides new evidence for the existence of a highly reduced HH group.

The mechanism of water oxidation catalyzed by this unprecedented trinuclear complex was studied by density functional calculations. The calculations showed that a series of oxidation and deprotonation events take place from A, leading to the formation of complex 1 (formal oxidation state of Ru1(IV)Mn(III)Ru2(III)), which is the starting species for the catalytic cycle. Three sequential oxidations of 1 result in the generation of the catalytically competing species 4 (formal oxidation state of Ru1(IV)Mn(V)Ru2(IV)), which triggers the O-O bond formation. The direct coupling of two adjacent oxo ligands bound to Ru and Mn leads to the production of a superoxide intermediate Int1. This step was calculated to have a barrier of 7.2 kcal mol(-1) at the B3LYP*-D3 level. Subsequent O-2 release from Int1 turns out to be quite facile. Other possible pathways were found to be much less favorable, including water nucleophilic attack, the coupling of an oxo and a hydroxide, and the direct coupling pathway at a lower oxidation state ((RuMnRuIV)-Mn-IV-Ru-IV).									9	0	0	0	0	0	9			1864-5631	1864-564X		WOS:000460682800019	30604589

In the present study, a 995 base pairs (bp) Prx1 cDNA sequence (LjPrx1) with an open reading frame of 594 bp, which encoding 197 amino acid polypeptides was obtained from L japonicus. Transcriptional expression analysis indicated that the LjPrx1 mRNA was ubiquitously expressed in all tissues tested, while a comparatively high expression level was detected in head-kidney and blood. After the recombinant LjPrx1 protein was acquired using a prokaryotic expression method, the antioxidant activity was assessed by the catalyzing hydrogen peroxide assay method, and the results showed that the recombinant LjPrx1 possessed an antioxidant activity in a temperature-dependent manner. To further study the function roles of LjPrx1 related to biotic and abiotic stresses, the head-kidney and blood were chosen for the following experiments, and a positive correlation between the expression of LjPrx1 and the different stresses was detected using qRT-PCR. In conclusion, this study provides useful information about the role of the LjPrx1 gene in defense against a variety of toxic factors in L japonicus, which would broaden our current knowledge of Prx1.									6	0	0	0	5	0	6			1050-4648	1095-9947		WOS:000443665900034	29964196

Meanwhile, hierarchical pore structures play a decisive role in determining the catalytic activity of N-doped porous carbon materials, since normally micropores provide active locations and macro/mesopores serve as mass transport channels. However, it remains challenging to engineer highly dispersed SACs with hierarchical pore structures due to the complexity in synthesizing extra templates with controlled sizes and the possible exogenous impurities from templates. Herein, we develop a facile "confined recrystallization" self-template strategy to synthesize a hierarchical porous Fe SAC on N-doped carbon (Fe-NC SAC) with an iron mass loading of 1.5 wt%, by using polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP), ferric nitrate and melamine. In this novel strategy, the introduced PVP can restrict the recrystallization of ferric nitrate owing to its large molecular weight. The formed nano-sized ferric nitrate crystals can not only serve as multifunctional self-templates to produce hierarchical pores, but also form atomically dispersed Fe-N-x sites through getting nitrogen from melamine. With the Fe-NC SAC as the catalyst, an excellent bifunctional ORR/OER performance and long-term durability superior to those of Pt/C and RuO2 are achieved in both liquid and solid Zn-air battery tests. Notably, in the flexible solid Zn-air battery, the Fe-NC SAC showed a high discharge voltage of 1.25 V and stable charge-discharge cycling at 1 mA cm(-2) under different bending conditions. Further density functional theory (DFT) calculations showed that the ORR follows the association mechanism of O-2 -> *OOH -> *O -> *OH -> OH-, while the OER goes on through the mechanism of OH- -> *OH- -> *O -> *OOH -> O-2, with a low theoretical overpotential of 1.21 V on the Fe-NC SAC. This work not only provides a novel strategy to endow SACs with a hierarchical pore structure, but also represents an example of how to effectively investigate the correlation between the structure and catalytic activity of catalysts.									53	4	0	0	1	0	53			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000536690000049

The non-metal material B2S3 has two phases, hexagonal B2S3 (h-B2S3) and orthorhombic B2S3 (o-B2S3), which compose a novel class of 2D materials. Both h-B2S3 and o-B2S3 monolayers are direct semiconductors with bandgaps of 2.89 and 3.77 eV by the Heyd-Scuserria-Ernzerhof (HSE) function, respectively. Under appropriate uniaxial strain (1%), the bandgap of h-B2S3 can be decreased to 2.8 eV. The carrier mobility can reach 1160 cm(2) V-1 s(-1), supporting the fast migration of photo-induced carriers. Most importantly, the band edges of both h-B2S3 and o-B2S3 cover the reduction and oxidation levels for water splitting. We explore the process of photocatalytic water splitting on h-B2S3 monolayers by analyzing the feasibility of the decomposition of H2O and the generation of H-2. The results indicate that the special mesoporous structure of B2S3 is helpful for photocatalytic hydrogen production. The new nanomaterial, B2S3, offers great promise as a metal-free photocatalyst due to its tunable bandgaps, its useful band edges, and its other excellent electronic properties.									10	0	0	0	0	0	10			0957-4484	1361-6528		WOS:000626871000001	33601348

As PDI is also known to bind various molecules including hormones such as estradiol and thyroxin, we considered the hypothesis that adverse effects of endocrine-disrupter compounds (EDC) could be mediated through their interaction with PDI leading to defects in membrane or secreted proteins.Methodology/Principal Findings: Taking advantage of the recent description of the fluorescence self quenched substrate di-eosin-oxidized-glutathion (DiE-GSSG), we determined kinetically the effects of various potential pharmaceutical EDCs on the in-vitro reductase activity of bovine liver PDI by measuring the fluorescence of the reaction product (E-GSH). Our data show that estrogens (ethynylestradiol and bisphenol-A) as well as indomethacin exert an inhibition whereas medroxyprogesteroneacetate and nortestosterone exert a potentiation of bovine PDI reductase activity.Conclusions: The present data indicate that the tested EDCs could not only affect endocrine target cells through nuclear receptors as previously shown, but could also affect these and all other cells by positively or negatively affecting PDI activity. The substrate DiE-GSSG has been demonstrated to be a convenient substrate to measure PDI reductase activity in the presence of various potential EDCs. It will certainely be usefull for the screening of potential effect of all kinds of chemicals on PDI reductase activity.									10	0	0	0	9	0	10			1932-6203			WOS:000275063400013	20209080

In this study, we have identified a full-length complementary DNA (cDNA) of HSP90 (FcHSP90) from Chinese shrimp Fenneropenaeus chinensis. FcHSP90 full-length cDNA comprised 2,552 bp, including a 2,181-bp open reading frame encoding 726 amino acids. Both homology analyses using alignment with previously identified HSP90 and a phylogeny tree indicated that FcHSP90 was a cytoplasmic HSP90. Real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction analysis revealed that FcHSP90 was ubiquitously expressed in all the examined tissues but with highest levels in ovary of F. chinensis. FcHSP90 mRNA levels were sensitively induced by heat shock (from 25A degrees C to 35A degrees C) and reached the maximum at 6 h during heat shock treatment. Under hypoxia conditions, FcHSP90 mRNA levels, in both hemocytes and gill, were induced at 2 h and depressed at 8 h during hypoxia stress. The assessment of FcHSP90 mRNA levels under heat shock and hypoxia stresses indicated that the transcription of FcHSP90 was very sensitive to heat shock and hypoxia, so we deduced that FcHSP90 might play very important roles for shrimp to cope with environmental stress.									61	17	0	0	57	0	78			1355-8145	1466-1268		WOS:000263352800006	18668349

Herein, we report the in situ deposit method on surface of Co9S8 by adjusting the number of sedimentary cycles to adjust Ni(OH)(2) loading capacity, and then firstly using the materials as water oxidation and water reduction catalysts. The one-dimensional Co9S8 nanorods was acted as an perfect support to enhance the uniform dispersion of amorphous Ni(OH)(2) nanoparticles, and the electrocatalytic deposited amorphous Ni(OH)(2) nanoparticles wrapped in the surface of Co9S8 nanorods highly improve the interfacial effect and afford more effective active centers for water splitting reaction. When Co9S8@Ni(OH)(2)(-) amorphous/NF-2h-2 cycles, Co9S8@Ni(OH)(2) - amorphous/NF-10h-2 cycles and Ni(OH)(2)(-) amorphous/NF is acted as a bifunctional catalyst, Co9S8@Ni(OH)(2)(-) amorphous/NF-2h-2 cycles presents a lower cell voltage (1.55 V@10 mAcm(-2)) than Co9S8@Ni(OH)(2)(-) amorphous/NF-10h-2 cycles (1.57 V@10 mAcm(-2)) and Ni(OH)(2)(-) amorphous/NF (NA412)10 mAcm(-2)). The activity of Co9S8@Ni(OH)(2)(-) amorphous/NF-2h-2 cycles is compared to that of the ideal the benchmark 25 wt % RuO2/NF-30 wt % Pt/NF (1.56 V@10 mAcm(-2)). Density functional theory (DFT) calculations were calculated to expound more mechanism on the interface effect of the sulfide/hydroxide-based catalysts for HER. For the two kinds of composite catalysts, both catalysts show good activity and stability in this work. Experiments show that Ni(OH)(2) does protect Co9S8 from corrosion under alkaline conditions. Our work paves the way for the development of environmentally friendly and relatively non-toxic water splitting electrocatalysts in terms of largescale applications.

However, the shuttle effects of iodine species and the unstable features of I-2 block the practical applications of Li-I-2 batteries. Herein, a dual heteroatom doped porous carbon cloth is fabricated as the host material for lithium iodide (LiI). Specifically, the self-standing nitrogen, phosphorus co-doped carbon cloth with high LiI loading exhibits a large specific capacity (221 mAh center dot g(-1) at 1 C), excellent rate capability (95.8% capacity retention at 5 C) and superior long cycling stability (2,000 cycles with a capacity retention of 96%). Electrochemical kinetic analysis confirms the dominant contribution of capacitive effects at high scan rates, which is responsible for the good high-rate performance. The improved electrochemical performance mainly stems from two unique features of nitrogen, phosphorus co-doped porous carbon cloth. Heteroatom doping provides extra active sites for strong adsorption of iodine species while the highly porous structure with large surface area favors the capacitive effects at high rates. This work provides a facile yet efficient approach to regulating both redox reaction and capacitive effects via adjusting surface composition and pore structure of carbon materials for enhanced battery performance.									40	0	0	0	1	0	40			1998-0124	1998-0000		WOS:000458992000010

However, little attention has been dedicated to assessing the effect of the coating thickness on their activity and service life, and no detailed study of the thickness of anodes made using ionic liquids has been conducted to date. Here we studied the influence of the ruthenium oxides film thickness (8.2, 13.7, and 16.5 mu m) on the physical, electrochemical, and electrocatalytic properties of Ti/RuO2 anodes. The electrodes were prepared using the 2-hydroxyethyl ammonium acetate (2HEAA) ionic liquid as the solvent of the precursor solutions. The properties of these anodes were compared with the RuO2-based commercial anode provided by De Nora (R) (17.7 mu m of thickness). The increase in RuO2 layer thickness from 8.2 mu m to 13.7 mu m, and then to 16.5 mu m decreases the voltammetric anode charge and increases their charge transfer resistance from 11.2 Omega to 28.2 Omega, and then to 52.7 Omega, respectively. Deactivation of the anodes was investigated by accelerated lifetime tests in H2SO4 and NaCl solutions. In acidic media, the anodes with a higher thickness (13.7 mu m and 16.5 mu m) presented longer service lifetimes, respectively, 1.5 and 1.4 higher than the electrode with 8.2 mu m. In NaCl medium, a higher thickness improves the service life significantly. The anode with 16.5 mu m of thickness has a service life up to 48.6 times higher than the anode with 8.2 mu m. All anodes, including the commercial one, presented high catalytic efficiency towards the electrochemical degradation of Reactive Black 5 dye. Within only 30 min of electrochemical treatment, all anodes removed more than 94% of color. It is shown that the use of anodes with low coating thicknesses is more favorable due to reduced time and energy costs of the synthesis process while maintaining a high degradation efficiency of the dye.

The covalently bonded g-C3N4/rGO was firstly prepared by the calcination of graphene oxide-guanidine hydrochloride precursor (GO-GndCl), following by its dispersion into the KMnO4 aqueous solution to construct the g-C3N4/rGO/MnO2 ternary nanocomposite. FT-IR, XRD, Raman as well as the XPS results clearly demonstrated the chemical interaction between g-C3N4, rGO and MnO2. TEM and element mapping indicated that layered g-C3N4/rGO was covered with thin MnO2 nanosheets. Furthermore, the obtained g-C3N4/rGO/MnO2 nanocomposite exhibited promising catalytic capacity on thermal decomposition of AP. Upon addition of 2 wt % g-C3N4/rGO/MnO2 ternary nanocomposite as catalyst, the thermal decomposition temperature of AP was largely decreased up by 142.5 degrees C, which was higher than that of pure g-C3N4, g-C3N4/rGO and MnO2, respectively, demonstrating the synergistic catalysis of the as-prepared nanocomposite.									44	2	0	0	6	0	45			2079-4991			WOS:000419186800045	29244721	
J	Gilbert, M; Domin, A; Becker, A; Wilhelm, C								Estimation of primary productivity by chlorophyll a in vivo fluorescence in freshwater phytoplankton								PHOTOSYNTHETICA				38	1			111	126		10.1023/A:1026708327185				2000	2000	Primary productivity in marine waters is widely estimated by the measurements of C-14 incorporation, the underwater light climate, and the absorption spectra of phytoplankton. In bio-optical models the quantum efficiency of carbon fixation derived from C-14 incorporation rates, the photosynthetically absorbed radiation derived from the underwater light climate, and the phytoplankton absorption spectra are used to calculate time- and depth-integrated primary productivity. Due to the increased sensitivity of commercially available fluorometers, chlorophyll a in vivo fluorescence became a new tool to assess the photosynthetic activity of phytoplankton. Since fluorescence data yield only relative photosynthetic electron transport rates, a direct conversion into absolute carbon fixation rates is not possible. Here, we report a procedure how this problem can be adressed in freshwater phytoplankton. We adapted a marine bio-optical model to the freshwater situation and tested if this model yields realistic results when applied to a hypertrophic freshwater reservoir. Comparison of primary productivity derived from C-14 incorporation to primary productivity derived from Chi a fluorescence showed that the conversion of fluorescence data into carbon fixation rates is still an unsolved problem. Absolute electron transport rates calculated from fluorescence data tend to overestimate primary production. We propose that the observed differences are caused mainly by neglecting the package effect of pigments in phytoplankton cells and by non-carbon related electron flow (e.g., nitrogen fixation). On the other hand, the C-14 incorporation rates can be artificially influenced by ''bottle effects", especially near the water surface, where photoinhibition, photorespiration, and Mehler reaction can play a major role.									71	1	0	0	61	0	71			0300-3604			WOS:000088968300015

Perylene diimide (PDI) supramolecular nanofibers, which absorb a broad spectrum of sunlight, were prepared via a facile acidification polymerization protocol. Under natural sunlight, the PDI photocatalysts achieved rapid treatment of fluoroquinolone antibiotics, including ciprofloxacin, enrofloxacin, norfloxacin, and ofloxacin. The fastest degradation was observed for ofloxacin, which had a half-life of 2.08 min for the investigated conditions. Various light sources emitting in the UV-vis spectrum were tested, and blue light was found to exhibit the fastest ofloxacin transformation kinetics due to the strong absorption by the PDI catalyst. Reactive species, namely, h(+), O-1(2), and O-2(center dot-), comprised the primary photocatalytic mechanisms for ofloxacin degradation. Frontier electron density calculations and mass spectrometry were used to verify the major degradation pathways of ofloxacin by the PDI-sunlight photocatalytic system and identify the transformation products of ofloxacin, respectively. Degradation mainly occurred through demethylation at the piperazine ring, ketone formation at the morpholine moiety, and aldehyde reaction at the piperazinyl group. An overall mechanism was proposed for ofloxacin degradation in the PDI-sunlight photocatalytic system, and the effects of water quality constituents were examined to determine performance in real water/wastewater systems. Ultimately, the aggregate results from this study highlight the suitability of the PDI-sunlight photocatalytic system to treat antibiotics in real water and wastewater systems.									145	3	0	0	69	0	145			0013-936X	1520-5851		WOS:000458220600055	30604606

This heat induced disorganization of thylakoid structure/organization caused significant (similar to 65 %) loss in PSII activity, slight loss in PSI activity, and brought about a decrease in relative quantum efficiency of PSII. The herbicide C-14 atrazine binding assay revealed a decreased number of binding sites of the herbicide and altered the herbicide dissociation constant, suggesting that the heat induced disorganization of the thylakoids affects the acceptor side of PSII. Cation induced Chi a fluorescence analyses at room temperature and low temperature indicated that in vivo heat exposure of rice seedlings altered the extent of energy transfer in favor of PSI. immunoblotting analysis of several PSII polypeptides such as D1/D2 reaction dimer and Cyt b(559) showed no major changes due to mild heat exposure except for the PSII core antenna polypeptide (CP43), which could reflect the reduction in PSII activity observed in light saturation studies. Similarly, haeme staining did not indicate any change in other cytochrome related polypeptides. Our results therefore clearly suggest that in vivo exposure of rice seedlings to elevated (40 degreesC) temperature caused thylakoid structural disorganization, and this disorganization of some of the thylakoid complexes resulted in a loss in thylakoid photochemical function.									55	11	0	0	49	2	65			0176-1617	1618-1328		WOS:000168896800007

Correlations between the D/H ratios and the chemical compositions (H2O, K, Si, C/H) of plausible hydrogen carriers were observed. From these correlations, it is possible to show that, contrary to previous interpretations, phyllosilicates are the carriers of the deuterium-rich hydrogen in Semarkona and Renazzo: 870 X 10(-6) greater than or equal to D/H greater than or equal to 670 x 10(-6) (+4600 greater than or equal to delta D greater than or equal to 3300 parts per thousand) and greater than or equal to 320 x 10(-6) (delta D greater than or equal to 1050 parts per thousand), respectively. Hydrogen is also present in the chondrules of these two deuterium-rich meteorites. The large differences in D/H ratios between matrix (up to 700 X 10(-6), delta D up to +3500 parts per thousand) and chondrules (from 120 X 10(-6) (delta D = -230 parts per thousand) to 230 X 10(-6) (delta D = +475 parts per thousand)) show that hydrogen in chondrules cannot originate from the matrix by simple contamination or diffusion processes.The high D/H ratios measured in water-bearing minerals could not have been produced thermally within a dense solar nebula. Chemical reactions (i.e., involving ions or radicals), taking place in interstellar space or in the outer regions of the nebula at 110-140 K are presently the only conceivable mechanisms capable of yielding such isotopic enrichments. Water in these meteorites should no longer be considered as a simple product of nebular condensation under equilibrium thermodynamic conditions at T greater than or equal to 160 K.									89	0	0	0	2	0	89			0016-7037			WOS:A1995TH38300011	11539426

ON THE IMPORTANCE OF PHOTOCHEMISTRY AND X-RAY IONIZATION								ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL				747	2					114	10.1088/0004-637X/747/2/114				MAR 10 2012	2012	We investigate the impact of photochemistry and X-ray ionization on the molecular composition of, and ionization fraction in, a protoplanetary disk surrounding a typical T Tauri star. We use a sophisticated physical model, which includes a robust treatment of the radiative transfer of UV and X-ray radiation, and calculate the time-dependent chemical structure using a comprehensive chemical network. In previous work, we approximated the photochemistry and X-ray ionization; here, we recalculate the photoreaction rates using the explicit UV wavelength spectrum and wavelength-dependent reaction cross sections. We recalculate the X-ray ionization rate using our explicit elemental composition and X-ray energy spectrum. We find that photochemistry has a larger influence on the molecular composition than X-ray ionization. Observable molecules sensitive to the photorates include OH, HCO+, N2H+, H2O, CO2, and CH3OH. The only molecule significantly affected by the X-ray ionization is N2H+, indicating that it is safe to adopt existing approximations of the X-ray ionization rate in typical T Tauri star-disk systems. The recalculation of the photorates increases the abundances of neutral molecules in the outer disk, highlighting the importance of taking into account the shape of the UV spectrum in protoplanetary disks. A recalculation of the photoreaction rates also affects the gas-phase chemistry due to the adjustment of the H/H-2 and C+/C ratios. The disk ionization fraction is not significantly affected by the methods adopted to calculate the photochemistry and X-ray ionization. We determine that there is a probable "dead zone" where accretion is suppressed, present in a layer, Z/R less than or similar to 0.1-0.2, in the disk midplane, within R approximate to 200 AU.									112	1	0	0	4	0	113			0004-637X			WOS:000302856400030

One such option is photocatalytic water splitting that has attracted much attention as a viable process for the large scale production of hydrogen as a renewable fuel. Within this perspective, we methodically studied the structural, optoelectronic, and photocatalytic properties of two-dimensional aluminum monochalcogenide monolayers with the chemical formula AlX (X = O, S, Se, and Te) based on the framework of Density Functional Theory (DFT). All considered structures are full relaxed and their thermodynamic stabilities are confirmed by computing the phonon spectrum and Ab Initio Molecular Dynamics (AIMD) simulations. The electronic characteristics are also performed on the basis of both exchange correlation functional GGA-PBE and HSE06 in order to obtain the accurate electronic band gap. According to our calculations, all the four monolayers posses indirect band gaps ranging between 1.937 and 2.46 eV. Furthermore, based on desirable electronic band gaps, the optical performance features were further explored including complex refractive index, absorption coefficient and energy loss function by means of the complex dielectric function. It is found that all the four materials present a high absorption coefficient in the visible and Ultra-Violet regions. Finally, the band edge positions of our monolayers straddle the reduction potential of H2 and the oxidation potential H2O. Also, it was found that the Gibbs free energy of 2D AlO monolayer is 0.02 eV at certain applied external electric field and very close to ideal catalysts which suggest that the AlO monolayer is better candidate for hydrogen production. Our findings demonstrate that AlX monolayers are suitable materials for optoelectronics and hydrogen production via photocatalytic water splitting.									10	0	0	0	0	0	10			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000734412800004

A similar protective effect of bicarbonate was also revealed in the dark, during thermoinactivation of O-2-evolving PSII at 40 degrees C: the rate of thermoinactivation of Delta F was decreased by a factor of 3 if 5 mM NaHCO3 was added to the medium. The results are consistent with the idea that bicarbonate is an essential component of the Mn-containing water-oxidizing complex of PSII, which decreases its susceptibility to photoinhibition and thermoinactivation.

DEVELOPMENTAL AND COMPARATIVE IMMUNOLOGY				33	10			1055	1063		10.1016/j.dci.2009.05.005				OCT 2009	2009	In the Common woodlouse Porcellio scaber (Crustacea: Isopoda: Oniscidea), experimental immune challenge did not induce the expression of pro-phenoloxidase that, in most other invertebrates studied thus far, can be activated into phenoloxidase via an activation cascade upon immune challenge. Instead, Porcellio hemocyanin proved to exhibit catecholoxidase activity upon activation. However, none of the activating factors known from other invertebrates other than SDS-treatment resulted in activation of hemocyanin into a functional phenoloxidase in vitro. The distinct characteristics of isopod hemocyanin are reflected by the quaternary structure of the hemocyanin dodecamers that differs from that of other crustacean hemocyanins in that the two hexamers share a common 3-fold rotation axis and have an angular offset of 60 degrees against each other. Accordingly, the sequence of Porcellio hemocyanin can be distinguished clearly from other crustacean hemocyanins and in a phylogenetic analysis forms a cluster with other isopod and amphipod hemocyanins. We propose a peracarid-type hemocyanin that may have evolved in response to its required multiple functions in respiration and immune response, while phenoloxidase sensu strictu is lacking.

Previous laboratory experiments have indicated that the S-MIF depends largely on the spectrum of the incident light source and the partial pressure of SO2, though the basic character of the Archean S-MIF (Delta S-36/Delta S-33 = similar to - 1) has never been reproduced. We have conducted new photochemical experiments at low pSO(2) (1-10 Pa) conditions under the presence of CO and found a reasonable mechanism to reproduce the Delta S-36/Delta S-33 slope about 1. As previously suggested (Ono et al., 2013), the low pSO(2) is key to studying the self-shielding effect within a range of realistic atmospheric conditions. Also, reducing conditions are critical for simulating the O-2-poor atmosphere, whereas photolysis of pure SO2 provides excess 0 atoms that significantly change the overall chemistry. Our experimental results confirmed that significant S-MIF (Delta S-36/Delta S-33 = -2.4) can be produced by self-shielding in the SO2 photolysis band (185-220 nm), even if the SO2 column density is as low as 10(16) molecules cm(-2). Thus, photolysis within a volcanic plume of similar to 0.1 ppm SO2 is capable of producing a large S-MIF signature. The isotopic fractionations originating from the different absorption cross sections of SO2 isotopologues (i.e. wavelength dependent effect; without self-shielding) are only minor (potentially up to +4%(0) for Delta S-33). Under reducing conditions, however, another S-MIF signal with Delta S-36/Delta S-33 ratio of similar to+0.7 is produced due to collision-induced intersystem crossing (ISC) from singlet to triplet states of SO2 (Whitehill et al., 2013), and should also be transferred into the final product that is responsible for changing the Delta S-36/Delta S-33 slope. Based on a photochemical model of the S-O-C system with the two SMIF-yielding reactions, the largest S-MIF observed in the late Archean Mt. McRae Fm. (Delta S-33 = +9.4%(0), Delta S-36 = -7.5%(0)) can be reproduced by solar UV irradiation of a SO2 column of similar to 6.4 x 10(16) molecules cm(-2) with a sufficiently high concentration of reducing gasses (similar to 2% CO or CH4) where the ISC-derived MIF contributes similar to 3% through the photoexcitation channel initiated in the 240-340 nm region. Our work shows that a photochemical model considering the two major S-MIF-yielding reactions (SO2 + hv -> SO + O and (SO2)-S-1 + M -> (SO2)-S-3 + M) can explain the behavior of the S-MIF observed in laboratory experiments. The combination of the two effects is more important under reducing condition and should be considered to interpret the geological record. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Taking the advantage of better charge transport between Ag2S and TiO2, this composite thin film has been utilized for electro-photocatalytic H-2 generation. This thin film growth requires three successive steps, including sol-gel derived ion-conducting thin film fabrication containing loosely bound light ion (Li+) followed by ion-exchange (with Li+ <-> Ag+) and subsequent sulfurization process. This entire solution-processed deposition technique is capable to fabricate cost-effective large area Ag2S-TiO2 thin film containing Ag2S NPs ranging similar to 10-70 nm. Since, Ag2S has a lower band gap and consider as a promising material for photo-electrochemical H-2 generation, therefore Ag2S (NPs)-TiO2 thin film is grown on three different substrates, including fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO), FTO/TiO2 (sol-gel), and FTO/TiO2 (NPs) to fabricate photoanode for this study. A comparative photo-electrocatalytic measurement of these three different Ag2S(NPs)-TiO2 thin film coated photoanodes showed that sample on FTO/TiO2 (NPs) substrate generate highest photocurrent of density similar to 50 mA cm(-2) at 0.5 V vs NHE in 1 M KOH solution which is three orders higher than pure TiO2 and stable for more than 1.5 h, indicating it's excellent potential application for photoelectrochemical water splitting. The photocurrent generation of this Ag2S-TiO2 thin film is significantly higher than earlier reported Ag2S-TiO2 system, which is originated due to the reduced carrier recombination from electronically coupled Ag2S/TiO2 interface state of such in situ grown Ag2S NPs.

The mutant is devoid of any photosystem II, activity, and none of the nuclear- and plastome-encoded subunits of this photosystem accumulate to significant levels. Protein labelling studies in the presence of cycloheximide showed that the piastome-encoded PSII subunits are synthesized but are not stable. The HCF136 gene was isolated by virtue of its T-DNA tag, and its identity was confirmed by complementation of homozygous hcf136 seedlings. Immunoblot analysis of fractionated chloroplasts showed that the HCF136 protein is a lumenal protein, found only in stromal thylakoid lamellae, The HCF136 protein is produced already in dark-grown seedlings and its levels do not increase dramatically during light-induced greening. This accumulation profile confirms the mutational data by showing that the HCF136 protein must be present when PSII. complexes are made. HCF136 homologues are found in the cyanobacteriun Synechocystis species PCC6803 (slr2034) and the cyanelle genome of Cyanophora paradoxa (ORF333), but are lacking in the plastomes of chlorophytes and metaphytes as well as from those of rhodo- and chromophytes, We conclude that HCF136 encodes a stability and/or assembly factor of PSII which dates back to the cyanobacterial-like endosymbiont that led to the plastids of the present photosynthetic eukaryotes.									173	4	0	0	163	0	180			0261-4189			WOS:000076125800004	9736608

This single stone, weighing 46.4 g, displays a well-preserved cumulative texture. It consists of zoned xenomorphic orthopyroxene grains on the order of 500 mu m in size, along with a few large chromite crystals (< 5 vol%, up to 3 mm). Accessory olivine and scarce diopside grains occur within the groundmass, usually around the chromite crystals. Minor phases are cristobalite, troilite, and metal. Unlike other diogenites, orthopyroxenes (En(76.2)Wo(1.1)Fs(22.7) to En(68.6)Wo(5.5)Fs(25.9)), olivines (Fo(76) to Fo(71)), and chromites (Mg# = 14.3 44.0, Cr# = 42.2-86.5) are chemically zoned. The minor element behavior in orthopyroxenes and the intricate chemical profiles obtained in chromites indicate that the zonings do not mirror the evolution of the parental melt. We suggest that they resulted from reaction of the crystals with intercumulus melt. In order to preserve the observed zoning profiles, NWA 4215 clearly cooled significantly faster than other diogenites. Indeed, the cooling rate determined from the diffusion of Cr in olivine abutting chromite is in the order of 1050 degrees C/a, suggesting that NWA 4215 formed within a small, shallow intrusion.The bulk composition of NWA 4215 has been determined for major and trace elements. This meteorite is weathered and its fractures are filled with calcite, limonite, and gypsum, typical of hot desert alteration. In particular, the FeO, CaO abundances and most of the trace element concentrations (Sr, Ba, Pb, and REE among others) are high and indicate a significant contribution from the secondary minerals. To remove the terrestrial contribution, we have leached with HCl a subsample of the meteorite. The residue, made essentially of orthopyroxene and chromite, has similar major and trace element abundances to diogenites as shown by the shape of its REE pattern or by its high Al/Ga ratio.

Herein, a low-cost pollen derived N,S co-doped porous carbon decorated with Co9S8/Fe3S4 nanoparticle hybrids (Co-Fe-S@NSRPC) has been synthesized. Owing to the active Co9S8/Fe3S4 nanoparticles, N,S co-doping, and large specific area of the pollen derived porous carbon matrix, the Co-Fe-S@NSRPC composite exhibits an excellent bifunctional catalytic activity with a small potential gap (Delta E = 0.80 V) between the half-wave potential for the ORR (0.80 V) and the potential at 10 mA cm(-2) for the OER (1.60 V), and endows a liquid Zn-air battery with a high power density of 138 mW cm(-2), a larger specific capacity of 891 mA h g(-1) and a stable rechargeability of up to 331 cycles. Based on the Co-Fe-S@NSRPC cathode catalyst, a 2D coplanar FS-ZAB has been fabricated with specially designed parallel narrow strip electrodes alternately arrayed on a polyacrylamide polyacrylic acid copolymer hydrogel solid electrolyte. The presented FS-ZAB exhibits excellent battery performance with high open-circuit-voltage (1.415 V), competitive peak power density (78 mW cm(-2)), large specific capacity (785 mA h g(-1)) and stable rechargeability (150 cycles), offers robust flexibility to maintain stable charge/discharge capacity under different bending deformations, and provides convenient coplanar integrability to realize parallel or series connection of multiple cells in a relatively small area.									14	1	0	0	1	0	15			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000540759000035	32458876

Designing semiconductor heterostructures as photocatalysts is a promising approach to enhance the photocatalytic efficiency for degrading organic pollutants. In this work, a novel WO3/BiOCl p-n heterostructure photocatalyst with optimal molar ratio was successfully fabricated by growing BiOCl nanosheets on WO3 nanofibers through the electrospinning method followed with a solvothermal process. The optical properties and photoelectrochemical tests indicated that the WO3/BiOCl heterostructures possess high ability of photogenerated charge separation. The photocatalytic performance of the as-obtained materials was assessed by the degradations of rhodamine B (RhB) and phenol in water under visible light. Compared with pure WO3 nanofibers and BiOCl nanosheets, the WO3/BiOCl heterostructure catalysts showed improved photocatalytic efficiencies, and the apparent rate constant of RhB degradation is 0.259 min(-1) on the optimal WO3/BiOCl(2) sample, which is about 2.3 times that of pure BiOCl (0.113 min(-1)). The roles of different active species in the photocatalytic system were determined by active-species-eliminating experiments, revealing that the photogenerated holes play a leading function in the degradation of organic pollutants. The enhanced photocatalysis of WO3/BiOCl(2) heterostructures results from the joint effect of high activity of BiOCl nanosheets, anti-agglomeration of WO3 nanofibers, and well-matched straddling band-structures for charge separation. This photocatalyst presents great potential in the removal of organic pollutants from aquatic environment.									41	0	0	0	4	0	41			0927-7757	1873-4359		WOS:000488954800054

Herein, we use electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy to characterize changes in the ligand coordination environment of the first photoactivation intermediate, the photo-oxidized Mn3+ bound to apo-WOC-PSII. On the basis of the observed changes in electron Zeeman (g(eff)), Mn-55 hyperfine (A(Z)) interaction, and the EPR transition probabilities, the photogenerated Mn3+ is shown to exist in two pH-dependent forms, differing in terms of strength and symmetry of their ligand fields. The transition from an EPR-invisible low-pH form to an EPR-active high-pH form occurs by deprotonation of an ionizable ligand bound to Mn3+, implicated to be a water molecule: [Mn3+(OH2)] <-> [Mn3+(OH-)]. In the absence of Ca2+, the EPR-active Mn3+ exhibits a strong pH dependence (pH similar to 6.5-9) of its ligand-field symmetry (rhombicity Delta delta = 10%, derived from g(eff)) and A(Z) (Delta A(Z) = 22%), attributable to a protein conformational change. Binding of Ca2+ to its effector site eliminates this pH dependence and locks both geff and AZ at values observed in the absence of Ca2+ at alkaline pH. Thus, Ca2+ directly controls the coordination environment and binds close to the high-affinity Mn3+, probably sharing a bridging ligand. This Ca2+ effect and the pH-induced changes are consistent with the ionization of the bridging water molecule, predicting that [Mn3+-(mu-O-2)-Ca2+] or [Mn3+-(mu-OH-)(2)-Ca2+] is the first light intermediate in the presence of Ca2+. The formation of this intermediate templates the apo-WOC-PSII for the subsequent rapid cooperative binding and photo-oxidation of three additional Mn2+ ions, forming the active water oxidase.									39	1	0	0	21	0	39			0006-2960			WOS:000241325700027	17042506

Doping of RGO with heteroatoms of N, B and P increased charge-transfer capability of nanocomposites and thus, improved both photocatalytic and photoelectrochemical hydrogen production activities of them. N-doped RGO-Cd0.60Zn0.40S photocatalyst exhibited the highest photocatalytic hydrogen production rate (1114 mu molh(-1) g(-1)) in photocatalytic (PC) system amongst other and it was 1.5 times higher than that of RGO-Cd0.60Zn0.40S photocatalyst. Having a current density of 0.92 mAcm(-2), photoelectrochemical hydrogen production activity of N-RGO-Cd0.60Zn0.40S electrode was found to be 3 times higher than RGO-Cd0.60Zn0.40S photoelectrode without any applied bias potential under visible light irradiation in photoelectrochemical system. In general, these results clearly showed that heteroatom doping of RGO led to promising materials for renewable hydrogen production in the photocatalytic and photoelectrochemical systems.

An inert gas, even of high-purity, contains a small amount of oxidizing agent, which has a significant impact on the processes of reorganization of the porous structure. It was found that the sintering of macroporous silicon in argon flow containing 2.10(-4)% O-2 is strongly affected by the thermal etching due to the formation of volatile silicon monoxide. This leads to an increase in the porosity, or even to the complete disappearance of the porous layer, and is accompanied by deposition of silicon dioxide in different forms. The thermal etching competes with the characteristic sintering processes of pore closure and prevents the formation of a defect-free crust on the sample surface. From the isochronous annealing performed at T = 1000-1280 degrees C for 30 minutes was found the activation energy of Si diffusivity Ea = 2,57 eV. This value together with the results of isothermal experiments are indicative of a mixed mechanism of mass transport by surface and bulk diffusion of silicon atoms. The sintering of macro-porous structures results in faceting with the crystallographic planes (111), (100), and (110), among which the lowest surface energy corresponds to the (111) planes.The result of competition between sintering and thermal etching: typical worm-like openings in the surface crust of a macro-porous silicon annealed in high purity Ar at 1125 degrees C.

The X-ray diffraction, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, scanning electronic microscopy, transmission electron microscope, vibrating sample magnetometer, dynamic laser scattering analyzer and UV-Vis diffuse reflection spectroscopy were employed for the characterization of structure, purity and morphology of the resultant samples. The degradation of indigo carmine as a model of organic dye pollutant is applied for photo-catalytic activity. The parameters which are affecting the efficiency of various parameters, such as; pH (5-9), photo-catalyst dose (30-120 mg), initial concentration of dye (1.0 x 10(-5)-7.5 x 10(-5) M) were studied. The results show that the high photo-degradation was obtained at pH 5, with 70 mg of photo-catalyst, for initial concentration of 1.0 x 10(-5) M the indigo carmine. In the kinetic part of this study is found that the photo-degradation of the dye follows pseudo-first-order kinetics according to the Langmuir-Hinshelwood model. The radical scavenger measurement illustrates that the electron generated from Bi2O3 was carried to the surface of Fe3O4 and this electron was shifted to the surface positive hole of g-C3N4. The electron on g-C3N4 surface reacted with O-2 and produced center dot O-2. The h(+) of Bi2O3 reacted with OH over bar to produce center dot OH. The center dot O-2(-), center dot OH and h(+) were the main active species in the photo-catalytic process.									6	0	0	0	1	0	6			0957-4522	1573-482X		WOS:000500621900002

There were three primary intertidal zones: Laizhou (La), Weifang Harbor (We), and Dongying (Do). Significant differences in composition and abundances at the different taxonomic levels were observed among the three bacterial communities. The qPCR results indicated that the nirS gene abundance varied from 8.67 x 10(5) to 5.68 x 10(6) copies/g wet weight (ww), whereas the nirK gene abundance varied from 1.26 x 10(5) to 1.89 x 10(6) copies/g ww. The canonical correlation analysis (CCA) indicated that the sand percentage was the most important factor in shaping the bacterial community followed by silt percentage, NO2,- TOC, DO, pH, and clay percentage, whereas the clay percentage, pH, NO3-, DO, NO2-, TOC, silt percentage, and sand percentage were the most important factors associated with regulating the abundance of nirS-and nirK-encoding denitrifiers.

In the present investigation, MoS2 incorporated CuCo2S4 nanocomposites have been successfully synthesized using a hydrothermal technique. The structural, morphological, elemental and chemical properties of the prepared CuCo2S4-MoS2 nanocomposite were investigated extensively. High resolution transmission electron microscopy imaging demonstrated the successful synthesis of CuCo2S4-MoS2 nanocomposites. The electrochemical capacitor performance of the nanocomposite has been evaluated both in three-electrode and symmetric two-electrode systems. In the three-electrode cell, a specific capacitance of 820 F g(-1) was achieved for the CuCo2S4-MoS2 electrode at a current density of 0.5 A g(-1) which is considerably higher than that of the CuCo2S4 electrode (249 F g(-1)). We observed that the charge storage capacity, conductivity and stability of CuCo2S4 improved significantly due to the incorporation of MoS2. Finally, an asymmetric supercapacitor was fabricated by assembling the CuCo2S4-MoS2 electrode with an activated carbon electrode which demonstrated a large stable working potential window of 1.6 V. Excellent long-term cyclic stability of 89% retention after 1000 galvanostatic charge-discharge cycles was evident. As a solid state device, it delivered a high energy density of 38.22 W h kg(-1) at a power density of 400 W kg(-1) and lit up one red LED for 170 s, indicating its superiority over the conventional Cu-Co based supercapacitors.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2050-7526	2050-7534		WOS:000792291800001

This is achieved via the formation in an in situ manner of relatively more stable Li-M-Si ternary phases with less chemical reactivity. These phases stabilize Si anions and thus reduce side reactions with electrolytes at the surface and eventually benefit the overall electrochemistry. To understand the mechanism of ternary Zintl phase formation and its dynamics upon lithiation/delithiation, high-resolution solid-state Li-7 and Si-29 nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) are utilized to directly probe the local Li and Si environments on Si electrodes harvested from coin and pouch cells at various states of (de)lithiation. The NMR spectra along with the electrochemical characterization reveal that lithiation of Si starts from the surface Si-O layer further confirmed by Li-7-Si-29 cross-polarization NMR. Lithiation progresses with heterogeneous silicon clustering with Si-4 anions at high states of lithiation. At a fully lithiated state, the formation of overlithiated Si species is detected. At a low-voltage region (below 100 mV), direct evidence for Mg-ion insertion is found, postulated by two possible mechanisms: ion exchange with fully or overlithiated binary domains (Li3.75+xSi) and/or a coinsertion with slightly underlithiated domains (similar to Li3.55Si). Upon delithiation, Li extraction starts from overlithiated Si domains. No evidence is found for electrochemical Mg removal. Evidence for a lithium-deficient LiyMg0.1Si phase is found as a result of Li removal during charging. This investigation sheds light on the possible mechanisms of a new Si anode chemistry, which could enable the development of stable Si-based anodes for lithium-ion batteries.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			0897-4756	1520-5002		WOS:000674266000012

Although numerous efforts have focused on the integration of both materials with optimized photocatalytic performance in recent years, the direct parameters for this emerging enhancement are not fully summarized yet. Fully understanding the synergistic effects between g-C3N4 and carbon materials on photocatalytic action is vital to further development of metal-free semiconductors in future studies. Here, recent advances of carbon/g-C3N4 hybrids on various photocatalytic applications are reviewed. The dominant governing factors by inducing carbon into g-C3N4 photocatalysts with involving photocatalytic mechanism are highlighted. Five typical carbon-induced enhancement effects are mainly discussed here, i.e., local electric modification, band structure tailoring, multiple charge carrier activation, chemical group functionalization, and abundant surface-modified engineering. Photocatalytic performance of carbon-induced g-C3N4 photocatalysts for addressing directly both the renewable energy storage and environmental remediation is also summarized. Finally, perspectives and ongoing challenges encountered in the development of metal-free carbon-induced g-C3N4 photocatalysts are presented.									80	5	0	0	7	0	82			1613-6810	1613-6829		WOS:000595307900001	33289337

The practical meaning of the term sub-nanometric material (SNM) requires two aspects: (1) its size should be at the atomic level; (2) it shows unique (size-related) properties compared to its nano-counterparts with larger sizes. Here, SNMs in the form of wires (SNWs) and the unique properties arising from their special size are reviewed. First, their polymer-like behavior, including rheological behavior and self-assembly, is dicussed. Their origins may stem from the special size and the ligands around the wire. Even a slight increase in diameter would risk the polymer-like behavior. Meanwhile, the ligands on SNWs are proportional to the inorganic entity at this scale. Consequently, surface ligands should have a profound impact on the properties, like catalysis, self-assembly, optics, etc. To reveal more potential applications, their applications in energy conversion are comprehensively reviewed. To some extent, characterization can greatly influence the way things are observed. Thus, some appropriate characterization techniques are briefly introduced. Finally, another emerging part of SNWs (atomic chain material) is briefly introduced. It is hoped that this review can provide new insights to this special scale.									85	4	0	0	6	0	85			0935-9648	1521-4095		WOS:000448786000010	30039573

Herein, the brilliant overall water splitting performance of cobalt-vanadium bimetal-based nanocomposites is explored. Co-V based nanocomposites are synthesized through a one-step hydrothermal method, in which the cobalt species is introduced into the lepidocrocite VOOH and further cobalt vanadium oxide is formed. The additive level of cobalt is optimized and the corresponding effect on electrocatalytic activity is also investigated in this work, systematically. The targeted catalyst (denoted as Co-0.2-VOOH) exhibits a unique sheet-like morphology, resulting in the high exposure of catalytically active sites. When used as the bifunctional catalyst, Co-0.2-VOOH can achieve a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at the overpotentials of 210 mV for water oxidation and 130 mV for hydrogen generation, respectively. Notably, it only requires low cell voltages of 1.57 and 1.74 V to drive the catalytic current densities of 10 and 100 mA cm(-2) during the water splitting process. This work significantly indicates that cobalt-vanadium based materials are promising alternatives for overall water splitting.									19	0	0	0	1	0	19			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000512634500032	31565714

However, the rapid recombination of photoexcited carriers and narrow visible-light response region substantially limit its performance. In this work, we have systematically studied the geometrical, electronic, optical, charge transfer and photocatalytic mechanism of (F, Ti) codoped heptazine/triazine based g-C3N4 heterostructure using hybrid density functional approach. The interface interaction between heptazine and triazine gC(3)N(4) shows heptazine and triazine g-C3N4 form a Van Der Waals heterostructure. The bandgap of (F, Ti) codoped heptazine/triazine based g-C3N4 heterostructure is narrow (2.39 eV), which enhances the absorption of visible light and leads to an obvious redshift of absorption edge. A type-II heterostructure is formed at the interface of (F, Ti) codoped heptazine/triazine based g-C3N4 heterostructure, and leads to high photocatalytic activity. Furthermore, Bader charge and charge density difference indicate that the internal electric field promotes the separation of electron-hole pairs in the heptazine/triazine g-C3N4 interface and inhibits carrier recombination. Meanwhile, electrons in the conduction band of triazine g-C3N4 and holes in the valence band of (F, Ti) codoped heptazine g-C3N4 have enough redox ability. This work is helpful in understanding the mechanism of photocatalytic water splitting and relevant experimental observations.									26	1	0	0	0	0	26			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000452782100091

R-GO was prepared from graphene oxide (GO) using the modified Hummer method after settle down in solution for 2 months to roll out. The R-GO coated the graphite (G) electrode using the dip-coating method to form G/R-GO. Finally, CNTs were prepared on the G/R-GO electrode by using the chemical vapor deposition method to form G/R-GO/CNT electrode. The images of field emission scanning electron microscope show the formation of relatively homogenous and uniform R-GO with an average diameter of about 140 nm. Also, the high density of CNTs was observed with uniform diameters distribution and lengths of CNTs up to several micrometers. The values of the current density of G/R-GO/CNT electrode for water splitting are changed from 0.82 mA cm(-2) in dark to 1.50 mA cm(-2) in light. The value of incident photon-to-current efficiency was 8.4% at 470 nm. The thermodynamic parameters were calculated, in which the activation energy (E-a), enthalpy (Delta H*), and entropy (Delta S*) values were 8.1 kJ mol(-1), 29.9 J mol(-1), and 56.4 J K-1 mol(-1), respectively.									23	0	0	0	3	0	23			0363-907X	1099-114X		WOS:000529703600001		
J	Zhang, Bo; Liu, Hong; Li, Yuanchang				Zhang, Bo/AAH-3712-2020	Zhang, Bo/0000-0001-7797-0038			The effect of instability of detonation on the propagation modes near the limits in typical combustible mixtures								FUEL				253				305	310		10.1016/j.fuel.2019.05.006				OCT 1 2019	2019	At the near-limit conditions, the behavior of detonation propagation manifests unstable modes; those modes are classified into three types, i.e., steady mode, fluctuation mode and fast failure mode. This work aims to elucidate essential physical relation between those unstable propagation modes and the instability of detonation. The velocity of the combustion wave in five mixtures (i.e., C2H4-6N(2)O, CH4-2O(2), 2H(2)-O-2, 70% and 85% Ar diluted C2H2-2.5O(2)) are experimentally measured to analyze velocity behavior near the limits. The stability parameter chi is computed from CHEMKIN package and chemical kinetics. According the detonation cellular pattern and the calculation of chi, C2H4-6N(2)O and CH4-2O(2) are considered as unstable mixtures (with highly irregular cells), 2H(2)O(2) is characterized as stable mixture (with regular structure), 70% and 85% Ar diluted C2H2-2.50(2) are determined to be highly stable mixtures (with highly regular pattern). In the above unstable/stable/highly stable mixtures, the detonation propagation behavior at the near-limit condition presents Slow Decay/ Fluctuation/ Fast Failure modes. Evidences confirm that instability (or cell regularity) dominates the propagation modes as detonation approaches the limits. The competition mechanism between detonation instability and boundary effect resulting in the slow decay of propagation velocity as the condition is outside the limits. However, for stable mixtures, due to the instability has very limited effect on the propagation of detonation, this competition mechanism is lacking, and resulting in detonation rapidly attenuates to a fast flame. In addition, the neutral stability curve (Ng et al., Combust Theor Model 2005;9:385-401) is an appropriate separatrix between Fast Failure/Fluctuation modes, a new second stability curve is proposed in this work, which is the boundary of Fluctuation/Slow Decay modes.									78	6	0	0	1	0	81			0016-2361	1873-7153		WOS:000471841600032

Here, a bottom-up wet chemical approach to synthesize Au/Ni2P heterostructures via Pt-catalyzed quasi-epitaxial overgrowth of Ni on Au nanorods (NR) is presented. The structural motif of the Ni2P is controlled using the aspect ratio of the Au NR and the effective micelle concentration of the C(16)TAB capping agent. Highly ordered Au/Pt/Ni2P nanostructures are employed as the photoelectrocatalytic anode system for water splitting. Electrochemical and ultrafast absorption spectroscopy characterization indicates that the structural motif of the Ni2P (controlled by the outer-shell deposition of Ni) helps to manipulate hot electron transfer during surface plasmon decay. With optimized Ni2P thickness, Pt-tipped Au NR with an aspect ratio of 5.2 exhibits a geometric current density of 10 mA cm(-2) with an overpotential of 140 mV. The photoanode displays unprecedented long-term stability with continuous chronoamperometric performance of 50 h at an input potential of 1.5 V with over 30 days. This work provides definitive guidance for designing plasmonic-catalytic nanomaterials for enhanced solar-to-chemical energy conversion.									32	1	0	0	3	0	32			1616-301X	1616-3028		WOS:000504700600001

The synthesized g-C3N4 nanoplatelets incorporated TiO2 nanocomposites were characterized by various analytical techniques such as UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, photoluminescence spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, thermogravimetric analysis and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM). HRTEM confirms the formation of type-II heterostructure consists of g-C3N4 nanoplatelets incorporated titania in the nanocomposite. The photoelectrocatalytic activity of the TiO2, g-C3N4, and g-C3N4/TiO2 nanocomposite were investigated under AM 1.5G (100 mW cm(-2)) illumination in 1 M KOH. The g-C3N4/TiO2 (with 10 wt.% of g-C3N4) nanocomposite photoanode exhibits photocurrent density of 142.7 mu A cm(-2) (at 1.23 V vs. RHE) which is similar to 1.8-fold higher than bare TiO2 (80.5 mu A cm(-2) at 1.23 V vs. RHE). The enhancement in PEC activity explained by formation of typeII heterostructure between g-C3N4 and TiO2, which reduced the recombination rate of photo-generated electron-hole pairs and also extends the absorption of TiO2 to visible light range and boost up the interfacial charge transfer between electrode/electrolyte interface, which enhance the PEC activity of the g-C3N4/TiO2 nanocomposite towards water splitting.									14	0	0	0	1	0	14			2523-3963	2523-3971		WOS:000532826500060

Herein, a unique strategy for decorating 3D tetragonal CoMn2O4 on carbon cloth (CMO-U@CC) via a facile one-pot in situ hydrothermal process, is reported. The highly exposed morphology of 3D tetragons enhances the electrocatalytic activity of CMO-U@CC. This is the first demonstration of such a bifunctional activity of CMO-U@CC in an EWS system; it achieves a nominal cell voltage of 1.610 V @ 10 mA cm(-2). Similarly, the fabricated rechargeable ZAB delivers a specific capacity of 641.6 mAh g(zn)(-1), a power density of 135 mW cm(-2), and excellent cyclic stability (50 h @ 10 mA cm(-2)). Additionally, a series of flexible solid-state ZABs are fabricated and employed to power the assembled CMO-U@CC-based water electrolyzer. To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first demonstration of an in situ-grown binder-free CMO-U@CC as a flexible multifunctional electrocatalyst for a built-in integrated rechargeable ZAB-powered EWS system.									19	0	0	0	1	0	19			1613-6810	1613-6829		WOS:000709864900001	34677907

Under these conditions, an O-2-dependent respiration highly resistant to cyanide was detected in cell extracts. The structural genes for the cyanide-resistant terminal oxidase, cioA and cioB, are clustered and encode the integral membrane proteins that correspond to subunits I and II of classical cytochrome bd, although the presence of heme d in the membrane could not be detected by difference spectra. The cio operon from P. pseudoalcaligenes presents a singular organization, starting upstream of cioAB by the coding sequence of a putative ferredoxin-dependent sulfite or nitrite reductase and spanning downstream two additional open reading frames that encode uncharacterized gene products. PCR amplifications of RNA (reverse transcription-PCR) indicated the cyanide-dependent up-regulation and cotranscription along the operon. The targeted disruption of cioA eliminates both the expression of the cyanide-stimulated respiratory activity and the growth with cyanide as the nitrogen source, which suggests a critical role of this cytochrome bd-related oxidase in the metabolism of cyanide by P. pseudoalealigenes CECT5344.									32	1	0	0	28	0	33			0099-2240			WOS:000248825900007	17574992

The two manganese ions, with a Mn-Mn distance of 3.498 angstrom, are bridged by the two bidentate acetate ligands and the 4-methylphenolate group of the ligand, resulting in a N3O3 and N2O4 donor set of Mn-II and Mn-II, respectively. Electrochemically [Mn2(II,III)L(mu-OAc)(2)](+) is reduced to [(Mn2L)-L-II,II(mu-OAc)(2)] at E-1/2(1)=-0.53 V versus Fc(+/0) and oxidised to [(Mn2L)-L-III,III(mu-OAC)(2)](2+) at E-1/2(2)=0.38 V versus Fc(+/0). All three redox states have been characterised by EPR, IR and UV/Vis spectroscopy. Subsequent oxidation of [(Mn2L)-L-II,III(mu-OAc)(2)](2+) [E-1/2(3)=0.75 V vs. Fc(+/0)] in dry acetonitrile results in an unstable primary product with a lifetime of about 100 ins. At high scan rates quasireversible voltammetric behaviour is found for all three electrode processes, with particularly slow electron transfer for the II,III/II,II [k(o)(1) = 0.002 cms(-1) and III,III/II,III [k(o)(2) = 0.005 cms(-1)] couples, which can be rationalised in terms of major distortions of the Mn-II centres. In aqueous media the bridging acetates are replaced by water-derived ligands. Deprotonation of these stabilises higher valence states, and photo-induced oxidation of the manganese complex results in a (Mn2L)-L-IlI,IV complex with oxo or hydroxo bridging ligands, which is further oxidised to an EPR-silent product. These results demonstrate that a larger number of metal-centred oxidations can be compressed in a narrow potential range if build up of charge is avoided by charge-compensating reactions.

In unalloyed Fe foams, redox cycling causes irreversible Kirkendall porosity growth within lamellae, leading to fracture and buckling in the lamellar architecture which in turn leads to foam densification after a few cycles. By contrast, Fe-25Co lamellae develop, upon oxidation, a pure Co core and a Fe3O4 shell which decreases buckling and Kirkendall pore growth, thus slowing sintering and densification of the lamellar foams. After Fe3O4 reduction, the Fe-rich shells and Co-rich cores of the lamellae re-homogenize by diffusion to the original single-phase Fe-25Co alloy, achieving a reversible microstructure upon a full redox cycle. After 10 cycles, average channel porosity (between lamellae) undergoes only a small decrease (from 62 % to 46 %), with minimal Kirkendall pore coarsening in the lamellae, consistent with strong sintering resistance in the Fe-25Co foams. The Fe-30Cu foams also display lamellae with Cu core and a Fe3O4 shell structure after oxidation, since Cu, like Co, does not oxidize under steam. However, the lack of solubility of Cu in Fe prevents re-homogenization after Fe3O4 reduction, so the resulting Cu-core / Fe-shell lamellae undergo severe sintering and densification upon subsequent redox cycling, with channel porosity reducing from 61 % to 9 % after just 5 cycles. For both systems, operando x-ray diffraction during redox cycling reveals that Cu, unlike Co, doubles the Fe oxidation rate, as compared to pure Fe foams. (C) 2022 Elsevier B.V.

Electrochemical interconversion with corresponding Bi- and mononuclear complexes								JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN CHEMICAL SOCIETY				120	22			5373	5380						JUN 10 1998	1998	A new chemical and electrochemical synthesis of the linear tetranuclear manganese complex, [(Mn4O6)-O-IV(bpy)(6)](4+) (bpy = 2,2'-bipyridine) (4) is described. This complex can be synthesized by a two-electron oxidation of an aqueous solution of the mononuclear [Mn-II(bpy)(3)](2+) (1) one. The aqueous solutions were buffered at pH 4.5 with acetate for the chemical synthesis and bpy for the electrochemical one to stabilize the intermediate binuclear [(Mn2O2)-O-III,IV(bpy)(4)](3+) (2) formed. In the case of chemical synthesis, KMnO4 is used as oxidizing agent. Electrochemical behavior of these complexes, including the trinuclear [(Mn3O4)-O-IV (bPY)(4)(H2O)(2)](4+) derivative (3), have been investigated in organic (CH3CN) and bpy/bpyH(+) buffer (pH 4.5). Carefully controlled potential oxidations of a solution of the mononuclear Mn(II) 1 in this latter medium lead to the successive formation of the high-valent oxo binuclear Mn-2(III,IV) (2) and tetranuclear Mn-4(IV) (4) complexes. These two dimerization reactions are quantitative. They result from the decoordination of bpy ligands and interaction with water of the unstable [Mn-III(bpy)(3)](3+) and [(Mn2O2)-O-IV,IV(bpy)(4)](4+) electrochemically generated species. In CH3CN, the higher stability of [Mn-2(IV,IV) O-2(bpy)(4)](4+) avoids the second dimerization process. All transformations are chemically reversible by reduction processes, although in aqueous buffered medium, the two steps are not clearly separated. Indeed, 2 cannot be generated quantitatively and selectively by reduction of 4 without any formation of 1, since the reduction potentials of 2 and 4 are too close. The electrochemical behavior of the trinuclear 3 complex in aqueous buffered solution follows the same process as that of 4 although its reduction is slightly easier than 2 and 4. Pertinent aspects of the electrochemistry of these oxo manganese complexes toward the modeling of the Mn-4 active site of PSII are also discussed.									38	0	0	0	3	0	38			0002-7863			WOS:000074213800003

Herein, highly efficient point-defect engineering including dual dopants as well as vacancy was adopted to modulate the photo-induced exciton dissociation kinetics. Specifically, P, O dopants and carbon vacancy modified 3D honeycomb-like POCVN was fabricated through facile one-pot polymerization with (NH4)(3)PO4 as P, O precursors. The obtained POCVN catalyst exhibited superior photocatalytic degradation performance for n-tetradecane under visible light illumination (38.1 %), which was 4.6 and 1.8 times higher than that of bulk g-C3N4 (8.2 %) and tubular g-C3N4 (21.1 %), respectively. The suppressed recombination of electrons and holes contributed to the superior catalytic performance compared to pristine g-C3N4, single P and single O doping g-C3N4. Structural analysis demonstrated P atoms may replace C atoms of N-C = N, O atom located at PO-C and carbon vacancies located at N = C-N-2 position at heptazine framework. Based on experimental and theoretical analysis, it was found P, O and Cv defects prefer to accumulate together in 3-trizine ring, which is conductive to the formation of localized defect state in the band gap region. It resulted in high exciton dissociation efficiency, thus, more reactive radicals were generated. Based on this, degradation path, interference parameter, reactive radicals and toxicity evaluation were investigated deeply and systematically. This work shed light on non-metal green ecological remediation material for marine oil spill.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000783232900004

Thirty-six million reads obtained from each library were assembled with the Musa acuminata genome sequence as a reference, using TOPHAT2 and Cufflinks software. Approximately 45,000 unigenes were obtained from each library and annotated against Musa and Viridae plantae databases. A comparison of the expression pattern from these four libraries was made based on digital gene expression (DGE) profiles. Major transitional shifts in gene expression were noticed among these four libraries. It was observed that nearly 4658 and 3261 transcripts were over-expressed in challenged libraries of the resistant and susceptible cultivar, respectively. Interestingly, the number of over-expressed transcripts was higher in the challenged resistant cultivar than in the challenged susceptible one. A total of 46 and 8 unique transcripts, which were significantly over- and under-expressed, respectively, in the challenged resistant cultivar, were identified. The M. eumusae-challenged resistant cultivar exhibited 36 pathogenesis-related gene families and 10 transcription factors. These findings are expected to lead towards the identification of candidate genes responsible for M. eumusae resistance in banana. This study revealed that pathogen resistance mechanisms in banana are part of a complex network of defense mechanisms through signal transduction involving ROS, lignin biosynthesis, hormonal pathways, detoxification and production of secondary metabolites. Apart from helping to elucidate resistance mechanisms, the transcriptome data are also being used for identifying functional markers for further use in breeding programs for pathogen resistance.					29th International Horticultural Congress on Horticulture - Sustaining Lives, Livelihoods and Landscapes (IHC) / 9th International Symposium on Banana / ISHS-ProMusa Symposium on Unravelling the Banana's Genomic Potential29th International Horticultural Congress on Horticulture - Sustaining Lives, Livelihoods and Landscapes (IHC) / 9th International Symposium on Banana / ISHS-ProMusa Symposium on Unravelling the Banana's Genomic Potential	AUG 17-22, 2014AUG 17-22, 2014	Int Soc Hort SciInt Soc Hort Sci	Brisbane, AUSTRALIABrisbane, AUSTRALIA	4	0	0	0	4	0	4			0567-7572	2406-6168	978-94-62611-08-5	WOS:000391249700016

The presence of strong free carrier absorption and phonon absorption in the low photon energy spectral range provides an opportunity to disentangle tailing effects extending in the near infrared to visible spectral range. Toward that end, a model describing ITO film optical properties in the form of the complex dielectric function (epsilon = epsilon(1) + i epsilon(2)) from ex situ ellipsometry collected over 0.4 to 4.1 meV, 0.035 to 0.4eV, and 0.75 to 5.89 eV spectral range is developed to describe these features along with other higher energy electronic transitions. In situ real time spectroscopic ellipsometry (RTSE) from 0.75 to 5.89 eV is used to track changes film structure and optical response during thin film growth. Optical emission spectroscopy indicates the plasma is very stable during deposition implying that film property changes with thickness are not correlated with changes in plasma chemistry. Film resistivity (rho), mobility (mu), scattering time (tau), and carrier concentration (n) are determined from the free carrier absorption component of epsilon. Increased near infrared absorption manifested in epsilon obtained from RTSE data analysis is hypothesized to originate from enhancement of OH-group phonon absorption due to the presence of water molecules in the chamber at the beginning of growth.									8	0	0	0	1	0	8			0022-3727	1361-6463		WOS:000436946400001

Herein we synthesize cobalt phosphide nanoparticles dispersed within nitrogen-doped carbon nanotube network (CP@NCNT) via scalable spray drying and thermal treatments. As a multifunctional electrocatalyst, the CP@NCNT hybrid delivers outstanding activity for HER (in both acidic and alkaline electrolytes), OER and overall water splitting. Remarkably, it shows an ultra-low overpotental of 94 mV to obtain 10 mA cm(-2) in HER. It also demonstrates outstanding activity in overall water splitting, requiring only 1.619 V to deliver 10 mA cm(-2) with more than 72 h' long-term stability. The combination of notable performance, multi-functionality and highly scalable spray-drying synthesis method enables this material as a novel and cost-efficient transition metal-based electrocatalysts for overall water splitting.

NHCSs, as a hard template, can aid the generation of Co3O4 nanosheets on its surface; while SiO2 spheres, as a sacrificed-template, can be dissolved in the process. The prepared Co3O4/NHCS composites are investigated as the electrode active material. This composite exhibits an enhanced performance than Co3O4 itself. A higher specific capacitance of 581 F g(-1) at 1 A g(-1) and a higher rate performance of 91.6% retention at 20 A g(-1) are achieved, better than Co3O4 nanorods (318 F g(-1) at 1 A g(-1) and 67.1% retention at 20 A g(-1)). In addition, the composite is employed as a positive electrode to fabricate an asymmetric supercapacitor. The device can deliver a high energy density of 34.5 Wh kg(-1) at the power density of 753 W kg(-1) and display a desirable cycling stability. All of these attractive results make the unique hierarchical Co3O4/NHCS core-shell structure a promising electrode material for high-performance supercapacitors.									304	23	0	0	15	0	308			1613-6810	1613-6829		WOS:000428344300002	29383854

The study described here explores the phylogeny of these dissimilar members, HopAO1 and HopAO2, among the complex and reveals their activities as immune defense suppressors. Although HopAO1 is predominantly encoded by phylogroup 3 strains isolated from woody organs of woody hosts, both HopAO1 and HopAO2 are phylogenetically clustered according to the woody/herbaceous nature of their host of isolation, suggesting host specialization of the HopAO family across the P. syringae complex. HopAO1 and HopAO2 translocate into plant cells and show hrpL-dependent expression, which allows their classification as actively deployed type III effectors. Our data also show that HopAO1 and HopAO2 possess phosphatase activity, a hallmark of the members of this family. Both of them exert an inhibitory effect on early plant defense responses, such as ROS production and callose deposition, and are able to suppress ETI responses induced by the effectorless polymutant of P. syringae pv. tomato DC3000 (DC3000D28E) in Nicotiana. Moreover, we demonstrate that a 1 hopAO1 mutant of P. savastanoi NCPBB 3335 exhibits a reduced fitness and virulence in olive plants, which supports the relevance of this effector during the interaction of this strain with its host plants. This work contributes to the field with the first report regarding functional analysis of HopAO homologs encoded by P. syringae or P. savastanoi strains isolated from woody hosts.									10	0	0	0	10	0	10			1664-462X			WOS:000400637300001	28529516
