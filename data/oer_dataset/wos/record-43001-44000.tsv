J	Karge, M; Irrgang, KD; Renger, G								Analysis of the reaction coordinate of photosynthetic water oxidation by kinetic measurements of 355 nm absorption changes at different temperatures in photosystem II preparations suspended in either H2O or D2O								BIOCHEMISTRY				36	29			8904	8913		10.1021/bi962342g				JUL 22 1997	1997	Flash-induced absorption changes at 355 nm were measured at different temperatures within the range of 2 degrees C less than or equal to curly theta less than or equal to 25 degrees C in dark-adapted PS II core complexes from spinach [O-2 evolution rate: 1500 +/- 100 mu mol of O-2 (mg of Chi)(-1) h(-1)] that were dissolved either in H2O- or in D2O-containing buffer. Comparative measurements were performed at 20 degrees C in H2O- or D2O-containing suspensions of PS II membrane fragments [O-2 evolution rate: 600 +/- 40 mu mol of O-2 (mg of Chi)(-1) h(-1)]. The results obtained reveal the following: (a) The activation energies of the individual redox steps in the water oxidizing complex (WOC) are dependent on the redox state S-i with E-A(S-1-->S-2) = 14 kJ/mol, E-A(S-2-->S-3) = 35 kJ/mol, and. E-A(S-3-->-->S-0 + O-2) = 21 kJ/mol for curly theta > 11 degrees C, 67 kJ/mol for curly theta < 11 degrees C in PS II core complexes dissolved in H2O; (b) replacement of exchangeable protons by deuterons causes only minor changes (less than or equal to 15%) of the activation energies; and (c) the rate constants of these reactions in PS II fore complexes are characterized by H/D isotope ratios, k(i)(H)/k(i)(D), of 1.6, 2.3, and 1.5 for the transitions S-1-->S-2, S-2-->S3, and S-3-->-->S-0 + O-2, respectively. The corresponding values of PS II membrane fragments are 1.3, 1.3, and 1.4, Based on these results and corresponding E-A data reported in the literature for PS II membrane fragments from spinach [Renger, G., & Hanssum, B. (1992) FEES Lett. 299, 28-32] and PS II particles from the thermophilic cyanobacterium Synechococcus vulcanus Copeland [Koike, II., Hanssum, B., Inoue, Y., & Renger, G. (1987) Biochim. Biophys. Acta 893, 524-533], the reaction coordinate of the redox sequence in the WOC is inferred to be almost invariant to the evolutionary development from cyanobacteria to higher plants. Furthermore, the rather high activation energy of the S-2-->S-3 transition provides evidence fur a significant structural change coupled with this reaction, Implications for the mechanism of photosynthetic water oxidation are discussed.									102	1	0	0	68	0	102			0006-2960			WOS:A1997XM53800028	9220978

In the modern era of dc voltammetry when the kinetic model of electron transfer with coupled chemical reactions was introduced, initial emphasis in theory-experiment comparison was placed on use of the ideal homogenous liquid mercury electrode with significant attention also given to polycrystalline and faceted metal electrodes. Nowadays, there are a plethora of carbon-based electrodes such as glassy carbon, edge and basal plane graphite, boron doped diamond, graphene and carbon nanotubes that may be extremely heterogeneous. These are supplemented by chemical modifications designed for example to improve the efficiency of electrocatalysis. In this review, it is shown that analysis of the higher harmonics available in large amplitude Fourier transformed alternating current voltammetry (FTacV) allows key processes to be detected, that are masked under commonly used dc voltammetric conditions. In particular it is shown how underlying fast electron processes that facilitate carbon dioxide reduction at tin electrodes and oxygen evolution at cobalt based electrodes can be directly detected and analysed for the first time. FTacV also experimentally reveals that structural defects or adatoms can give rise to well-defined higher order ac harmonics suggesting that a fast electron transfer process is associated with the active sites during electrocatalytic oxidation or reduction. Importantly, electron transfer processes often can be evaluated by FTacV in the presence and absence of the electrocatalysis, unlike dc voltammetric methods. The ability to analyse third and higher order ac harmonics that are essentially devoid of background charging current and which allow the electron transfer and catalytic steps to be resolved, presents new opportunities for fundamental advances in understanding complex electrochemical reaction mechanisms taking place at heterogeneous electrodes. Related advantages in studying electron transfer of surface confined metallo-enzymes or proteins in the presence and absence of their catalytically oxidised or reduced biologically relevant substrate partners are also surveyed. Finally, prospects for providing quantitative accounts of complex reactions at highly heterogeneous electrodes by FTacV are considered.									21	0	0	0	2	0	21			2451-9103			WOS:000442800000013

Interestingly, PBA cores can act as a self-sacrificing template and decompose during high-temperature treatment. PDA shells play a crucial role in stabilizing the steric architecture, supplementing nitrogen-doping of CBs@NCCs under high-temperature treatments. When compared with carbon nanobubbles (CBs) without the protection of carbon nanocages, CBs@NCCs possess higher specific surface area and pore volume. The contributions of a unique configuration and proper nitrogen modification are significant for improving the peroxymonosulfate (PMS) activation performance of CBs@NCCs, which is expected to be a promising alternative to other conventional carbocatalysts and metal oxides. Moreover, the applicability of the as-synthesized carbocatalysts was systematically investigated by adjusting several operating parameters, and some ubiquitous anions and natural organic matters (NOMs) were also taken into account in methylene blue (MB) degradation. The radical evolution and PMS activation mechanism are investigated by radical quenching and electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) tests, which revealed that sulfate radicals (SO4-) and singlet oxygen (O-1(2)) are simultaneously responsible for the overall MB removal in a CBs@NCCs-800/PMS system. This study may provide a broader perspective for upgrading the catalytic efficiency of various green heterogeneous carbocatalysts.									39	5	0	0	12	0	41			2052-1553			WOS:000442606200012

Such photocatalysts showed 92.83% and 73.86% degradation and mineralization efficiency of the oxytetracycline hydrochloride (OTC) within 90 min, respectively. Meanwhile, Response Surface Method (RSM) predicted that under optimal conditions (electricity 18.586 A, initial pH 6.371 and dosage 0.6 g/L), OTC degradation efficiency of 94.331% can be achieved. FeOOH NPs/Nvac-CNNS exhibited the excellent reutilization and practical application potential in OTC pollution purification of high and low concentration. The synergistic effect of N vacancies and FeOOH coupling endowed CNNS with advantages, such as the carrier's fast separation, good visible-light adsorption, H2O2 fast decomposition and excellent molecular oxygen activation. Such advantages greatly contribute to OTC efficient removal in water. Based on the liquid chromatographmass spectrometer (LC-MS) analysis, the five possible degradation pathways of OTC were provided. Furthermore, through the quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) analysis, biological toxicity prediction results of OTC and its intermediates indicated that the FeOOH NPs/Nvac-CNNS/vis system had great potential to achieve green and harmless treatment of OTC pollution.

J	St John, Samuel; Nan, Zhipeng; Hu, Naiping; Schaefer, Dale W.; Angelopoulos, Anastasios P.								A nanoscale-modified LaMer model for particle synthesis from inorganic tin-platinum complexes								JOURNAL OF MATERIALS CHEMISTRY A				1	31			8903	8916		10.1039/c3ta11552f				2013	2013	The size-tunable structure and properties of Pt nanoparticles at the atomic length scale have attracted significant attention across a wide variety of fields including magnetics, electrocatalysis, optics, and gas-phase synthesis. Mechanisms responsible for the formation Pt nanoparticles remain unclear because of the difficulty generating in situ data for the time-evolution of size, shape, distribution, volume fraction, particle number density, and oxidation state from the starting complexes. We here demonstrate the use of simultaneous small-and wide-angle X-ray scattering combined with UV-vis spectroscopy to measure these key synthesis metrics for the reduction of Pt(IV) by Sn(II) in aqueous solution. This synthesis approach has been previously shown to permit continuous control over Pt nanoparticle size from 0.9 to 2.6 nm to within 10% standard deviation. Such fine control led to the discovery of densely packed amorphous structures at ca. 1.7 nm with substantially enhanced electrocatalytic oxygen reduction relative to nanocrystals and commercial electrocatalysts. Ex situ UV-vis and in situ X-ray scattering are here shown to reveal four distinct stages during synthesis: (1) autoreduction of a ligand/noble metal complex with a unique structure that depends on the Sn(II)/Pt(II) ratio, (2) generation of Pt primary particles and the formation of Pt nuclei at a rate that depends on the structure of the initial complex, (3) nanoparticle growth via LaMer's diffusion of these primary particles to the nuclei, and (4) growth termination due to capping from a stabilizing, two-layer ligand shell. We derive a set of consecutive rate equations and associated kinetic parameters that describe each step. The kinetics of ligand rearrangement has been previously found to limit the rate of nanoparticle growth. We incorporate this phenomenon into LaMer's classic diffusion-limited growth scheme to extend it to the nanoscale regime. This new model provides detailed understanding of how metal ligands serve as both reducing and stabilizing agents and allow for unprecedented, continuous control over both size and distribution. Systematic variation of temperature permits detailed time resolution at the very onset of Pt primary particle formation, as well as a means to determine temperature sensitivity of nanoparticle growth.									16	0	0	0	0	0	16			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000321864300028

After this pre-treatment, a low level of MDA radicals was also detectable without illumination. Light-induced MDA, MDA production in the dark, oxygen evolution, quantum yield of PSII as measured by Chi fluorescence, MDA producing and reducing enzyme activities were determined and compared in leaves after irradiation with various doses of UVB. Our results suggest that UV-B irradiation disturbs the balance of MDA radical production and reduction, resulting in increased light induced MDA signal. The enhancement of ascorbate photooxidation at the UV-B damaged donor side of PSII appears as a major factor in this process.									52	0	1	0	42	0	53			0032-0781	1471-9053		WOS:A1997XF27600006

However, a significant challenge is the limited density of such sites. Reducing the size and layer number of MoS2 and vertically aligning them would be an effective way to enrich and expose such sites for HER. Herein, a facile self-limited on-site conversion strategy for synthesizing monolayer MoS2 in a couple of nanometers which are highly dispersed and vertically aligned on 3D porous carbon sheets is reported. It is discovered that the preformation of well-dispersed MoO3 nanodots in 1-2 nm as limited source is the key for the fabrication of such an ultrasmall MoS2 monolayer. As indicated by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and electron spin resonance data, these ultrasmall MoS2 monolayers are rich in accessible S-edge sites and vacancies and the smaller MoS2 monolayers the more such sites they have, leading to enhanced electrocatalytic activity with a low overpotential of 126 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) and 140 mV at 100 mA mg(-1) for HER. This state-of-the-art performance for MoS2 electrocatalysts enables the present strategy as a new avenue for exploring well-dispersed ultrasmall nanomaterials as efficient catalysts.									110	7	0	0	3	0	111			1614-6832	1614-6840		WOS:000445666000004		
J	Boichenko, VA; Klimov, VV; Miyashita, H; Miyachi, S								Functional characteristics of chlorophyll d-predominating photosynthetic apparatus in intact cells of Acaryochloris marina								PHOTOSYNTHESIS RESEARCH				65	3			269	277		10.1023/A:1010637631417				2000	2000	Functional organization of the photosynthetic apparatus in the unique chlorophyll d-predominating prokaryote, Acaryochloris marina, was studied using polarographic measurements of single-turnover flash yields, action spectra and optical cross sections for PS-specific reactions. O-2 evolution was indicative of PS II activity, while reversible photoinhibition of respiratory O-2 uptake under aerobic conditions in the presence of DCMU and H-2 photoevolution by anaerobically adapted cells were the indicatives of PS I activity. O-2 evolution in the cells upon single-turnover flashes followed the normal S-state cycle with a period-4 oscillation. Analysis of action spectra for the partial reactions of photosynthesis revealed that: (1) distinct spectral forms of Chl d are nonuniformly distributed between PS I and PS II, e.g. Chl d-695 and Chl d-735 are preferentially located in PS II and PS I, respectively; (2) a minor fraction of Chl a in the cells belongs mostly to PS II; (3) biliproteins transfer excitation energy both to PS II and, with a lower efficiency, PS I; (4) the efficiency of energy transfer from biliproteins to PS II depends on the light quality growth conditions and is larger in white light (WL)-grown cells compared to the red light (RL)-grown cells. Content of functional O-2 evolving PS II centers decreases 2 times in the RL-grown cells relative to the WL-grown cells, whereas content of competent PS I centers involved in photoinhibition of respiration remains almost the same in both the cultures. The effective antenna size of PS I was estimated to be 80-90 Chl d including 3-10 molecules absorbing at 735 nm. The effective optical cross-section of PS II corresponded to 90-100 Chl d and, presumably, 4 Chl a + 2 Pheo a [Mimuro et al. (1999) Biochim Biophys Acta 1412: 37-46]. Optical cross-section measurements indicated that the functional PS II units of A. marina attach one rod of four hexameric units of biliproteins.									37	1	0	0	33	0	38			0166-8595	1573-5079		WOS:000167853900007	16228493

Here, we are reporting a one pot synthesis of CdS/CdO colloidal nanocomposite with variable amount of CdS thickness and finally CdS nanoring. Different outward diffusion rate of oxygen and inward diffusion rate of sulphur ions generates hollow CdS/CdO nanocomposite based on nanoscale Kirkendall effect. Au nanoparticles (NPs) have been selectively deposited over CdS. Proper band alignment among CdO, CdS and Au results in a Z-type photocatalyst. Efficient spatial charge separation and large surface area lead to high photocatalytic dye degradation and Cr (VI) reduction in water. The amount of Cd in purified water is lesser than 0.003 ppm which maintains world Health Organization (WHO) guideline. The as developed catalyst is also active for generation of H-2 from water in presence of solar light irradiation. Our present work may provide a promising way to fabricate an efficient photocatalyst for dye degradation and solar to fuel energy conversion using semiconductor (CdO)semiconductor (CdS)-metal (Au) nanocomposite.									18	2	0	0	2	0	19			0920-5861	1873-4308		WOS:000491876500031

This investigation aimed to evaluate the effect of the evolution of corona discharge exposition on the superficial, physical and mechanical properties of eucalyptus and pinus nanofibril films. Cellulose nanofibrils were produced from commercial bleached cellulose pulps after 30 passages in a SuperMasscolloider Grinder. Films were formed by a casting method. The corona discharge treatment was applied for 10, 30, 60, and 300 s at a distance of 3 cm. Furthermore, the duration of the surface modification was evaluated after 6, 24, 48, 72, and 96 h. The corona discharge promoted the formation of hydroxyl, carbonyl, and other functional groups by breaking C-C bonds and their subsequent reaction with oxygen. The best corona treatment time was 30 s, for which maximum water vapor permeability of 13.1 and 14.2 g mm/KPa day m(2) was found for the eucalyptus and pinus films, respectively. In addition, maximum water absorption (of around 35%) was observed for films of both genera treated for 30 s. The tensile strength increased in response to increasing corona treatment exposition. Pinus nanofibril films showed better performance than eucalyptus nanofibril films due to their higher crystalline index and nanofibril dimensions. Through the analysis of contact angle and surface energy, it was verified that printing of corona treated nanofibril films should be carried out for up to 24 h when the films still exhibit the treatment effect.									7	0	0	0	2	0	7			0969-0239	1572-882X		WOS:000441935500012		
J	Collen, J; Pedersen, M								Production, scavenging and toxicity of hydrogen peroxide in the green seaweed Ulva rigida								EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF PHYCOLOGY				31	3			265	271		10.1080/09670269600651471				AUG 1996	1996	Some aspects of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) production, scavenging and toxicity in Ulva rigida (Chlorophyta) have been investigated. The seaweed produced H2O2 in light and excretion increased exponentially with increasing light up to 800 mu mol photons m(-2) s(-1) where the excretion rate was 330 mu mol (kg Chl a)(-1) s(-1). This corresponded to a concentration of 4 mu M H2O2 in the experimental medium after 30 min (density of seaweed: 9.2 kg fresh weight m(-3)). At 1200 mu mol photons m(-2) s(-1), the excretion rate decreased to 190 mu mol (kg Chl a)(-1) s(-1). At 600 mu mol photons m(-2) s(-1), the excretion caused a concentration of 1.8 mu M H2O2 in the experimental seawater; after a further 2 h the concentration decreased to a steady level of c. 0.8 mu M. The enzymatic degradation of H2O2 is suggested to be primarily through the activity of ascorbate peroxidase (62 mmol H2O2 (kg Chl a)(-1) s(-1)) since no catalase activity was detected. The H2O2 levels in U. rigida are reduced by diffusion through the plasmalemma. Addition of 1 mM H2O2 caused an 80% reduction in photosynthesis while no effect was seen at 0.1 mM. Addition of 3 mM H2O2 caused decreased variable fluorescence and decreased light-dependent oxygen evolution; these effects persisted even after the H2O2 was washed away. These observations suggest that the endogenous production by U. rigida has no direct auto-toxic effect.									56	0	0	0	53	1	57			0967-0262	1469-4433		WOS:A1996VD86700009

Two types of peroxide, highly lipophilic ones and relatively hydrophilic ones, were distinguished by the rate of reaction with Spy-HP; the former oxidized Spy-HP to the higher fluorescent form Spy-HPOx within 5 min, while the latter did so very slowly (the reaction was still not completed after 180 min). The level of photoproduction of these peroxides was significantly larger in the alkaline-treated, Mn-depleted PSII membranes than that in the untreated membranes, and it was suppressed by an artificial electron donor (diphenylcarbazide or ferrocyanide) and by the electron transport inhibitor diuron. Postillumination addition of Fe(2+) ions, which degrade peroxides by the Fenton mechanism, abolished the accumulation of Spy-HPOx, but catalase did not change the peroxide level, indicating that the detected species were organic peroxides, excluding H(2)O(2). These results agreed with our previous observation of an electron transport-dependent O(2) consumption on the PSII donor side and indicated that ROOH accumulated via a radical chain reaction that started with the formation of organic radicals on the donor side. Illumination (lambda > 600 nm; 1500 mu mol of photons m(-1) s(-1)) of the Mn-depleted PSII membranes for 3 min resulted in the formation of nearly 200 molecules of hydrophilic ROOH per reaction center, but only four molecules of highly lipophilic ROOH. The limited formation of the latter was due to the limited supply of its precursor to the reaction, suggesting that it represented structurally fixed peroxides, i.e., either protein peroxides or peroxides of the lipids tightly bound to the core complex. These ROOH forms, likely including several species derived from lipid peroxides, may mediate the donor side-induced photoinhibition of PSII via protein modification.									22	0	2	0	21	0	24			0006-2960			WOS:000297598800011	22023168

The GC-MS analysis results illustrated that N-species content in the bio-oil reduced with the addition of the biochar catalyst, while the hydrocarbons content increased from 15.51% for co-pyrolysis to 38.74-61.84% for different biochar catalysts at a catalytic temperature of 650 degrees C. RHC exhibited the best catalytic effect in terms of decreasing the content of N-species by 58.79% and increasing the content of hydrocarbons by nearly four times compared to co-pyrolysis. The higher heating value of bio-oil raised from 25.75 to 34.67 MJ/kg, while oxygen content decreased from 31.1 to 8.81 wt%, and the pH increased from 4.06 to 5.48. Moreover, the catalytic mechanism of catalytic co-pyrolysis over RHC, including the hydrocarbon generation pathway and nitrogen removal, is also discussed here. High specific surface area of RHC provides sufficient active sites (e.g. O-containing and N-containing functional groups) for the catalytic reaction of pyrolytic intermediates. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Mendybaev, RA; Beckett, JR; Grossman, L; Stolper, E; Cooper, RF; Bradley, JP								Volatilization kinetics of silicon carbide in reducing gases: An experimental study with applications to the survival of presolar grains in the solar nebula								GEOCHIMICA ET COSMOCHIMICA ACTA				66	4			661	682	PII S0016-7037(01)00802-X	10.1016/S0016-7037(01)00802-X				FEB 2002	2002	The volatilization kinetics of single crystal alpha-SiC, polycrystalline beta-SiC, and SiO2 (cristobalite or glass) were determined in H-2-CO2, CO-CO2, and H-2-CO-CO2 gas mixtures at oxygen fugacities between 1 log unit above and 10 log units below the iron-wustite (IW) buffer and temperatures in the range 1151 to 1501degreesC. Detailed sets of experiments on SiC were conducted at 2.8 and 6.0 log units below IW (IW-2.8 and IW-6.0) at a variety of temperatures, and at 1300 C at a variety of oxygen fugacities. Transmission electron microscopic and Rutherford backscattering spectroscopic characterization of run products shows that the surface of SiC exposed to IW-2.8 is characterized by a thin (<1 &mu;m thick), continuous layer of cristobalite. SiC exposed to IW-6.0 lacks such a layer (or its thickness is <0.01 Am), although some SiO2 was found within pits and along incised grain boundaries.In H-2-CO2 gas mixtures above similar toIW-3, the similarity of the SiC volatilization rate and of its dependence on temperature and fO(2) to that for SiO2 suggests that SiC volatilization is controlled by volatilization of a SiO2 layer that forms on the surface of the SiC. With decreasing log fO(2) from similar toIW-3 to similar toIW-6, the SiC volatilization rate is constant at constant temperature, whereas that for SiO2 increases. The independence of the SiC volatilization rate from the gas composition under these conditions suggests that the rate-controlling step is a solid-solid reaction at the internal SiC/SiO2 interface. For gas compositions more reducing than similar toIW-6, the SiC volatilization rate increases with decreasing fO(2), with both bare SiC surfaces and perhaps silica residing in pits and along incised grain boundaries contributing to the overall reaction rate.If the volatilization mechanism and reaction rate in the solar nebula were the same as in our H-2-CO2 experiments at IW-6.0, then estimated lifetimes of 1-mum-diameter presolar SiC grains range from several thousand years at similar to900degreesC, to similar to1 yr at 1100degreesC, similar to1 d at 1300degreesC, and similar to1 h at 1400degreesC. The corresponding lifetimes for 10-mum SiC grains would be an order of magnitude longer. If the supply of oxidants to surfaces of presolar SiC grains were rate limiting-for example, at T > 1100degreesC for P-tot = 10(-6) atm and sticking coefficient = 0.01, then the calculated lifetimes would be about 10 yr for 10-mum-diameter grains, essentially independent of temperature. The results thus imply that presolar SiC grains would survive short heating events associated with formation of chondrules (minutes) and calcium-, aluminum-rich inclusions (days), but would have been destroyed by exposure to hot (greater than or equal to900degreesC) nebular gases in less than several thousand years unless they were coated with minerals inert to reaction with a nebular gas.

In this study, the Ti/PbO2 electrodes prepared by the electroplating method were characterized. The CAP degradation effect and mechanism were investigated. It was shown that the electrode surface had a dense plating with a characteristic peak of beta-PbO2 as the active component. The electrode had an oxygen precipitation potential of 1.695 V and a corrosion potential of 0.553 V, and a long service life (505.4 d). The degradation of CAP at Ti/PbO2 electrode followed a first-order kinetic reaction. The optimal degradation conditions (current density of 12.97 mA cm(-2), electrolyte concentration of 50 mM, and solution pH of 6.38) were obtained by the response surface curve method. The degradation rate of CAP was 99.0% at 60 min. The results showed that the reactive groups leading to CAP degradation were mainly center dot OH and SO42-, and only a tiny portion of CAP was directly oxidized on the electrode surface. The addition of Cl- favored the degradation of CAP, but reduced the mineralization rate. LC-MS analysis showed that center dot OH mainly attacked the asymmetric centers (C1, C2) of weakly bound hydrogen atoms, resulting in underwent addition and substitution reactions. CAP was converted into two substances with m/z = 306 and m/z = 165. Finally, inorganic substances such as CO2 and H2O were generated. This study provided a new idea for preparing Ti/PbO2 electrode with high performance and the safe and efficient degradation of CAP.									7	0	0	0	2	0	7			0045-6535	1879-1298		WOS:000703681600004	34710968	
J	Shi Yan-Hua; Meng Hui-Min								Electrochemical Behavior of IrO2 Electrodes in the Anodic Electrodeposition of MnO2								ACTA PHYSICO-CHIMICA SINICA				27	2			461	467		10.3866/PKU.WHXB20110216				FEB 2011	2011	The electrochemical behavior of IrO2 electrodes in a MnSO4 plating solution and in a H2SO4 solution at different temperatures was investigated by polarity curve and cyclic voltammetry methods. The anodic electrode deposition was carried out at different current densities according to the polarity curve obtained in the bath and the deposition velocity was measured. The results show that the anodic electrode deposition reactions and the O-2 production reaction on the IrO2 electrode in the bath occur simultaneously and the former reaction obviously restrains O-2 production. The process of MnO2 electrodeposition onto IrO2 is complicated and a Mn3+ intermediate product is produced, which can be oxidized to Mn4+ during the electrode deposition. Mn3+ is hydrolyzed at the same time as the oxidation and its hydrolysate desorbs, which causes an obvious reduction in current efficiency for the MnO2 anodic electrodeposition. A potential range exists for the MnO2 anodic electrode deposition and we also found a maximum value for the deposition velocity within the potential range.									1	5	0	0	0	0	6			1000-6818			WOS:000286597200030

Several kinases of the 46-member Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) receptor-like cytoplasmic kinase (RLCK) subfamily VII play important roles in pattern-triggered immunity, but it is unclear whether different RLCK VII members act specifically or redundantly in immune signaling. Here, we constructed nine higher order mutants of this subfamily (named rlck vii-1 to rlck vii-9) and systematically characterized their immune phenotypes. The mutants rlck vii-5, -7, and -8 had compromised reactive oxygen species production in response to all patterns tested, indicating that the corresponding members are broadly required for the signaling of multiple PRRs. However, rlck vii-4 was defective specifically in chitin-induced reactive oxygen species production, suggesting that RCLK VII-4 members mediate the signaling of specific PRRs. Furthermore, RLCK VII-4 members were required for the chitin-triggered activation of MAPK, demonstrating that these kinases link a PRR to MAPK activation. Moreover, we found that RLCK VII-6 and -8 also were required for RK-mediated root growth. Together, these results show that numerous RLCK VII members are involved in pattern-triggered immune signaling and uncover both common and specific roles of these kinases in plant development and immunity mediated by various RKs.									72	9	0	0	64	0	75			0032-0889	1532-2548		WOS:000440980500027	29907700

A number of possible reactive complexes [FA ... HO] and product complexes [COOH ... H2O] formed in solution, as well as the corresponding transition-state structures, were optimized at the MP2/aug-cc-pVTZ theory level, followed by single-point CCSD(T) calculations. It is shown that in aqueous solution the formyl hydrogen abstraction is energetically favored and associated with the effective barriers Delta H-b of 0.1-0.2 eV, which are about two times lower than that for carboxylic hydrogen abstraction. The overall reaction is highly exothermic (Delta H of about -5.8 eV) and expected to be very fast. The results confirm the validity of our hypothesis that the electrochemical incineration of formic acid may occur in solution according to the outer sphere mechanism.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			2196-0216			WOS:000471745700009

The effects of Gd content in the microstructure, discharge behavior and electrochemical properties of cast AZ31 as an anode are studied through microstructure characterization, electrochemical measurements and battery discharge tests. Results indicate that the introduction of Gd can refine alpha-Mg grains. The discharge and electrochemical properties of magnesium alloys are improved by optimizing its composition. We confirm that the Al2Gd can restrain the kinetics of hydrogen evolution reaction. The acicular structure can connect the magnesium alloy matrix and reduce the chunk spalling. The data suggest that AZ31-5.8Gd alloy has the best self-corrosion resistance performance and discharge behavior among all prepared AZ31-xGd alloys. AZ31-5.8Gd can output a high specific capacity of 1411.8 mAh g(-1) and a high energy density of 1153 mWh g(-1) at the current density of 40 mA cm(-2). The anode efficiency can reach up to 63.21%.

XRD, N-2-physisorption, XPS and H-2-TPR measurements were used to characterize the physicochemical properties of catalysts, which showed that the newly established C-O-B bond reduced the ionic valence of the B-site, and the redox capacities were increased or decreased to different degrees, respectively. Catalytic tests showed that T-50 of La-Co-C-O composites (LC-C) and La-Fe-C-O composites (LF-C) are 377 degrees C and 482 degrees C, much lower than that of unmodified catalyst, respectively. But T-50 of La-Mn-C-O composites (LM-C) increases to 507 degrees C from 493 degrees C. The superior performance of LC-C could be attributed to the high oxygen vacancies and enhanced redox property, and the better performance of LFC was mainly benefited from the increase in lattice oxygen. For LM-C, the sacrifice of Mn4+ weakened the catalytic activity. There are more obvious mechanistic differences for different B-site elements in the La-B-O-C. The study will bring innovative insights into the design of excellent composites catalysts for methane oxidation. (C) 2021 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

To address this issue, regulation of electron configuration via optimizing surface atom properties is a promising strategy for improving the separation of electron-hole pairs. Here, sea urchin carbon nitride (SUCN-6) with C-v and O-s mediated electronic structures were facile prepared, endowing it with a decrease in transportation resistance of charge carriers and increased activation towards oxygen. Under visible light, the SUCN-6 showed a removal efficiency of ~ 89% towards tetracycline (TC) in 20 min and no obvious decaying after five consecutive cycles. This TC photodegradation follows a first-order kinetic, and its kinetic constant reaches 0.0908 min(-1), which is 2.35 folds higher than that of pristine carbon nitride. In addition, several crucial factors of practical wastewater purification (such as pH, TC concentration, water sources, inorganic salts, and organic matters) that might affect photoactivity were investigated. Moreover, the degradation pathways of TC and intermediates were detected by an HPLC-MS and electron spin resonance instrument, and a possible photodegradation mechanism over SUCN-6 was elucidated. This study offers new insights into the photocatalysis kinetics and photodegradation mechanism over carbon nitride for environmental remediation.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000810444900003

It has great potential in the field of hydrogen evolution by photocatalytic water splitting due to its special properties. In this paper, layered graphdiyne is prepared by crosscoupling method, using CuI instead of typical copper film as catalyst. Graphdiyne/CuI is used to modify Mn0.2Cd0.8S (MCS) solid solution for the first time, which greatly improves the optical properties and hydrogen production performance of the photocatalyst. The S-scheme heterojunction constructed between graphdiyne and MCS greatly improves the transfer rate of photoinduced electrons. In addition, the results of fluorescence spectra and photoelectrochemical tests show that the nanocomposites have longer carrier lifetime, lower recombination rate, faster carrier migration rate, and lower hydrogen evolution overpotential. Therefore, the hydrogen evolution rate of the MnCdS/graphdiyne/CuI with the best performance can reach 9.904 mmol g(-1) h(-1), which is 4.02 times of that of pure MCS. This work not only proposes the possible mechanism of photocatalytic hydrogen production but also provides an important strategy for the application of graphdiyne in the field of photocatalytic hydrogen production.									10	1	0	0	0	0	10			2196-7350			WOS:000671791900001

This anodic reaction generates hydrogen or electrical power through direct electrooxidation of urea molecules, but is greatly inhibited by its slow kinetics. Therefore, tailoring highly efficient, earth-abundant, and durable electrocatalysts for urea oxidation reaction (UOR) is a fundamental for the enhancement of green energy conversion technologies. Herein, we report a scalable synthetic strategy to construct three-dimensional (3D) nickel-cobalt layered double hydroxide nanosheet arrays (NiCo-LDH NSAs) with silver (Ag-0) or gold (Au-0) and palladium (Pd-0) intercalants as high performance catalysts for UOR. Experimental results suggest that the interlayer spacing of multi-anions LDH NSAs can effectively afford synergetic effects of increased electrochemical surface area, better exposure of catalytically active sites, and favorable adsorption energy of urea molecules. As expected, the deposition of noble metal nanoparticles (NPs) could successfully modulate the electronic structure, delivering a rise to significantly improved UOR activity. Specifically, the Au/NiCo-LDH hybrid exhibits a superior electro-catalytic performance toward urea electrooxidation with a highest current. These findings offer an effective pathway to prepare potential earth-abundant electrocatalysts for direct urea fuel cells (DUFCs).									43	2	0	0	1	0	44			2196-0216			WOS:000496912200001

Due to its extreme reactivity, the radical in PflB must be controlled carefully and, once generated, is particularly susceptible to dioxygen. Exposure to oxygen of the radical on glycine residue 734 of PflB results in cleavage of the polypeptide chain and consequent inactivation of the enzyme. Two decades ago, a small 14kDa protein called YfiD (now called autonomous glycyl radical cofactor [GrcA]) was shown to be capable of restoring activity to O-2-inactivated PflB in vitro; however, GrcA has never been shown to have this function in viva By constructing a strain with a chromosomally encoded PflB enzyme variant with a G734A residue exchange, we could show that cells retained near-wild type fermentative growth, as well as formate and H-2 production; H-2 is derived by enzymatic disproportionation of formate. Introducing a grcA deletion mutation into this strain completely prevented formate and H-2 generation and reduced anaerobic growth. We could show that the conserved glycine at position 102 on GrcA was necessary for GrcA to restore PflB activity and that this recovered activity depended on the essential cysteine residues 418 and 419 in the active site of PflB. Together, our findings demonstrate that GrcA is capable of restoring in vivo activity to inactive full-length PflB and support a model whereby GrcA displaces the C-terminal glycyl radical domain to rescue the catalytic function of PflB.IMPORTANCE Many facultative anaerobic microorganisms use glycyl radical enzymes (GREs) to catalyze chemically challenging reactions under anaerobic conditions. Pyruvate formate-lyase (PflB) is a GRE that catalyzes cleavage of the carbon-carbon bond of pyruvate during glucose fermentation. The problem is that glycyl radicals are destroyed readily, especially by oxygen. To protect and restore activity to inactivated PflB, bacteria like Escherichia co/i have a small autonomous glycyl radical cofactor protein called GrcA, which functions to rescue inactivated PflB. To date, this proposed function of GrcA has only been demonstrated in vitro. Our data reveal that GrcA rescues and restores enzyme activity to an inactive full-length form of PflB in vivo. These results have important implications for the evolution of radical-based enzyme mechanisms.									1	0	0	0	1	0	1			0021-9193	1098-5530		WOS:000799004400018	35377165

The as-synthesized NPCFO-700 exhibited excellent catalytic performance in activating PMS, and the degradation rate constant of 4-chlorophenol (4-CP) increased with the increase of OV concentration in NPCFO-x. EPR analysis confirmed the existence of center dot OH, SO4 center dot-, and O-1(2) in the NPCFO-700/PMS system, in which OV could induce the generation of 1O2 by PMS adsorption and successive capture, and also served as electronic transfer medium to accelerate the redox cycle of M2+/M3+ (M denotes Co or Fe) for the generation of radical to synergistically degrade organic pollutants. In addition, the contribution of free radical and nonradical to 4-CP degradation was observed to be strongly dependent on solution pH, and SO4 center dot- was the major ROS in 4-CP degradation under acid and alkaline condition, while 1O2 was involved in the degradation of 4-CP under neutral condition due its selective oxidation capacity, as evidenced by the fact that such organic pollutants with ionization potential (IP) below 9.0 eV were more easily attacked by O-1(2). The present study provided a novel insight into the development of transition metal-based heterogeneous catalyst containing massive OV for high-efficient PMS activation and degradation of organic pollutants.

We show that the integrated fluxes obtained along the targeted dissociating channel is larger with the optimized pulse than with the unoptimized one. The flux ratios are also more impressive with the optimized pulse than with the unoptimized one. We also look at the evolution contours of the wavefunctions along the two channels with time after the actions of both the IR and UV pulses and compare the profiles for unoptimized (initial) and optimized fields for better understanding the results that we achieve. We also report the pulse parameters obtained as well as the final shapes they take. (C) 2015 AIP Publishing LLC.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			0021-9606	1089-7690		WOS:000362971600010	26472365

The experimental study reveals that this combination of bR and GaN NWN has huge potential as a light-activated sensitizer as well as proton pumping source to achieve enhance photocurrent density in hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Consequently, this synergistic effect in bR/GaN NWN PA gives rise to largely enhanced applied bias photon-to-current efficiency (ABPE) similar to 7.8% and photocurrent density (28.74 mA/cm(2) at 1.0 V vs RHE). It is worth mentioning that the photocurrent density of bR/GaN NWN, to the best of our knowledge, is superior to previously reported bR-based PAs and bio-photoelectric devices reported till today for solar-to-hydrogen fuel generation.

Incorporation of nitrogen to the carbon structure in graphene oxide (GO) or reduced GO (rGO) flakes in aqueous solutions was carried out based on two different configurations. NrGO(NH3) particles were obtained by a hydrothermal method using ammonium hydroxide as the precursor, and NGO(APTES) particles were obtained by silanization (APTES functionalization) of GO sheets. Aqueous dispersions containing NrGO(NH3) and NGO(APTES) particles were added to the traditional nickel Watts plating bath in order to prepare the Ni-NrGO(NH3) and Ni-NrGO(APTES) catalysts, respectively. Nickel substrates were coated with the hybrid nickel electrodeposits and used as electrodes for hydrogen production. The Ni-NrGO catalysts show a higher activity than the conventional nickel electrodeposited electrodes, particularly the ones containing APTES molecules because they allow obtaining a hydrogen current density 130% higher than conventional Ni-plated electrodes with a Watts bath in the absence of additives. In addition, both catalysts show a low deactivation rate during the ageing treatment, which is a sign of a longer midlife for the catalyst. Cyclic voltammetry and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy measurements were used for examination of the catalytic efficiency of hybrid Ni-NrGO electrodes for HER in KOH solution. High values of exchange current densities, 8.53 x 10(-4) and 2.53 x 10(-5) mA cm(-2) for HER in alkaline solutions on Ni-NrGO(NH3) and Ni-NrGO(APTES) electrodes, respectively, were obtained.									18	0	0	0	0	0	18			2470-1343			WOS:000460214700241	31459465

The reducers-to-oxidizers ratio (phi) is a very important parameter in the solution combustion synthesis of mixed ionic-electronic conductors. Selection of phi is not trivial and it strongly depends on the type of fuel used, the chemical composition and the specific application of the material. This work clarifies the role of phi in the solution combustion synthesis of Ba0.5Sr0.5Co0.8Fe0.2O3-delta for application as oxygen electrocatalysts. Ba0.5Sr0.5Co0.8Fe0.2O3-delta powders were synthesized by solution combustion synthesis using sucrose-polyethylene glycol fuel mixtures with reducers-to-oxidizers ratio values between 1 (stoichiometric) and 3 (over-stoichiometric). Chemical-physical properties were studied by X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, N-2 adsorption at -196 degrees C, H-2-temperature programmed reduction and thermogravimetric analysis. The results evidenced the direct role of phi on the intensity and redox environment of the combustion process, and its indirect influence on the Ba0.5Sr0.5Co0.8Fe0.2O3-delta electrode materials properties. Taking into account the general picture, the highly over-stoichiometric phi was selected as the optimal one and the electrochemical activity of the corresponding powder was tested by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy on electrolyte-supported half-cells employing a Ce0.8Sm0.2O2-x electrolyte.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0				2073-4344		WOS:000601862100001

Although various catalysts have been recently developed for NRRs, their inefficiency remained a huge obstacle for further commercialization. In this work, a shell-engineering strategy is proposed for the design of iron-doped titanium dioxide hollow nanospheres (FeHTNs) with abundant oxygen vacancies for NRRs based on the breathing process of mammalian alveolus. The hollow structure and porous shell of FeHTNs enable fast delivery of N-2 reactants into the cavity of "alveolus" and stay in there longer and thus give N-2 molecules more chance to contact the inner surface of electrocatalysts and hence greatly enhance NRR kinetics for the formation of ammonia. The dissolved ammonia in the electrolytic solution, in turn, creates negative pressure in cavities, which can suck N-2 reactants automatically into the cavity, triggering the "domino effect" for continuous NRRs. A record ammonia yield of 43.14 mu g h(-1) mg(cat.)(-1) at -0.7 V vs. RHE was achieved on Fe1.0HTN catalysts, close to the top of the pyramid among recently reported TO2-based catalysts. Besides, Fe(1.0)HTNs were employed as a N-2 cathode for assembled Zn-N-2 aqueous batteries, achieving both ammonia production (average NH3 yield: 0.172 mu g h(-1) cm(-2)) and electricity generation (power density: 16.42 mu W cm(-2)), which offers a fascinating prospect for practical applications.									11	0	0	0	1	0	11			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000621407000020

To achieve higher H-2 production efficiencies from water splitting, the study uses different metals such as yttrium (Y), praseodymium (Pr), magnesium (Mg), Indium (In), calcium (Ca), europium (Eu), and terbium (Tb) doped lanthanum iron oxide (LaFeO3) perovskites. They were synthesized using a co-precipitate method in a citric acid solution, which was loaded with the rhodium chromium oxide (RhCrOx) cocatalysts by an impregnation method along with a detailed investigation of photocatalytic hydrogen evolution performance. Photoluminescence (PL) and UV-Vis diffuse reflectance spectra (DRS) measured the rate of electron-hole recombination for RhCrOx/Pr-LaFeO3 photocatalysts, and X-ray powder diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscope (SEM), high resolution transmission electron microscope (HRTEM), and X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS) analyzed their characteristics. The experimental results obtained show that the samples with 0.5 wt.% RhCrOx loading and 0.1 M Pr-doped LaFeO3 calcined at a temperature of 700 degrees C (0.1Pr-LaFeO3-700) exhibited the highest photocatalytic H-2 evolution rate of 127 mu mol h(-1) g(-1), which is 34% higher photocatalytic H-2 evolution performance than undoped LaFeO3 photocatalysts (94.8 mu mol h(-1) g(-1)). A measure of 20% of triethanolamine (TEOA) enabled a high hole capture capability and promoted 0.1-Pr-LaFeO3-700 to get the highest H-2 evolution rate.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1				2073-4344		WOS:000653606200001

Herein, a calcium metalate catalyst CaCoOx with oxygen vacancies was synthesized and used as an electrocatalyst for NRR for the first time, whose morphology can be controlled by the calcination temperature and the heating rate. Under the optimal conditions, the CaCoOx catalyst achieved the yield of nitrogen conversion to ammonia of 16.25 mu g center dot h(-1)center dot mg(cat)(-1) at the potential of -0.3 V relative to the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) with a Faraday efficiency of 20.51%. The electrocatalyst showed good stability even after 12 times recyclability under environmental conditions and neutral electrolyte. Later, the electrocatalytic nitrogen reduction performance of CaFeOx, CaNiOx, CaCuO(x)was investigated. These earth-rich transition metals also exhibited certain NRR electrocatalytic capabilities, which provided a door for further development of inexpensive and easily available transition metal as nitrogen reduction electrocatalysts.									11	1	0	0	0	0	11			1998-0124	1998-0000		WOS:000566314200002

A reduced chemical mechanism for premixed CH4/air combustion with NOx based on GRI-Mech3.0 was used, including 268 elementary reactions and 28 transported species. The evolution of the stretch factor, I-0, indicates that the burning rate per unit flame surface area is considerably reduced in the near field and exhibits a minimum at x/D = 8. Downstream, the burning rate gradually increases. The stretch factor is different between different species, suggesting the quenching of some reactions but not others. Comparison between the turbulent flame and strained laminar flames indicates that certain aspects of the mean flame structure can be represented surprisingly well by flamelets if changes in boundary conditions are accounted for and the strain rate of the mean flow is employed; however, the thickening of the flame due to turbulence is not captured. The spatial development of displacement speeds is studied at higher Ka than previous DNS. In contrast to almost all previous studies, the mean displacement speed conditioned on the flame front is negative in the near field, and the dominant contribution to the displacement speed is normal diffusion with the reaction contribution being secondary. Further downstream, reaction overtakes normal diffusion, contributing to a positive displacement speed. The negative displacement speed in the near field implies that the flame front situates itself in the pilot region where the inner structure of the turbulent flame is affected significantly, and the flame stabilizes in balance with the inward flow. Notably, in the upstream region of the turbulent flame, the main reaction contributing to the production of OH, H+O-2 double left right arrow O+OH (R35), is weak. Moreover, oxidation reactions, H-2+OH double left right arrow H+H2O (R79) and CO+OH double left right arrow CO2+H (R94), are influenced by H2O and CO2 from the pilot and are completely quenched. Hence, the entire radical pool of OH, H and O is affected. However, the fuel consumption layer remains comparably active and generates heat, mainly via the reaction CH4+OH double left right arrow CH3+H2O (R93). (C) 2017 The Combustion Institute.

J	Leonard, Kevin C.; Bard, Allen J.								The Study of Multireactional Electrochemical Interfaces via a Tip Generation/Substrate Collection Mode of Scanning Electrochemical Microscopy: The Hydrogen Evolution Reaction for Mn in Acidic Solution								JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN CHEMICAL SOCIETY				135	42			15890	15896		10.1021/ja407395m				OCT 23 2013	2013	We report a new method of scanning electrochemical microscopy (SECM) that can be used to separate multireactional electrochemical interfaces, i.e., electrodes at which two or more reactions occur (and hence two partial currents flow) at the same time. This was done with a modified tip generation/substrate collection mode where the two reactions occur on the tip electrode, and the substrate electrode is held at a potential to collect only one of the products, allowing the determination of the individual partial currents. Thus, by using the substrate electrode current and the difference between the tip and substrate electrode currents, the two reactions occurring on the tip electrode can be separated. As a test case for this new method, we investigated proton reduction on Mn, a reaction that, because of the highly corrosive nature of Mn, to our knowledge has never before been directly measured. This test was carried out using a Mn tip electrode and a Pt substrate electrode. Using a three-dimensional COMSOL Multiphysics simulation, we were able to accurately determine the tip/substrate distance with this electrode, and by fitting simulations to experimental data, we were able to determine an exchange current density, log(j(0)) = -4.7 +/- 0.7 A cm(-2), for proton reduction on Mn in strong acid. This result corrects a literature value and was used in a pattern recognition algorithm reported in a companion manuscript.									31	0	0	0	3	0	31			0002-7863	1520-5126		WOS:000326215900038	24063768	
J	BOOTHROYD, AI; SACKMANN, IJ; WASSERBURG, GJ				WASSERBURG, GERALD J/F-6247-2011				HOT BOTTOM BURNING IN ASYMPTOTIC GIANT BRANCH STARS AND ITS EFFECT ON OXYGEN ISOTOPIC ABUNDANCES								ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL				442	1			L21	L24		10.1086/187806				MAR 20 1995	1995	A self-consistent calculation of asymptotic giant branch (AGE) evolution was carried out, including nucleosynthesis at the base of the convective envelope (hot bottom burning). Hot bottom burning was found to occur for stars between similar to 4.5 and similar to 7 M., producing envelopes with O-18/O-16 less than or similar to 10(-6) and 10(-3)less than or similar to(17)O/O-16 less than or similar to 10(-1). The O-17 abundance depends sensitively on the nuclear O-17-destruction rate; this rate is only loosely constrained by the requirement that first and second dredge-up models match O-isotope observations of red giant branch (RGB) stars (Boothroyd, Sackmann, and Wasserburg 1994). In some cases, high mass-loss rates can terminate hot bottom burning before further O-17 enrichment takes place or even before all O-18 is destroyed. These predictions are in accord with the very limited stellar observations of J type carbon stars on the AGE and with some of the circumstellar Al2O3 grains from meteorites. In contrast, precise data from a number of grains and data from most low-mass S and C AGE stars (less than or similar to 1.7 M.) lie in a region of the O-18/O-16 versus O-17/O-16 diagram that is not accessible by first and second dredge-up or by hot bottom burning. We conclude that for AGE stars, the standard models of stellar evolution are not in accord with these observations. We surmise that an additional mixing mechanism must exist that transports material from the cool bottom of the stellar convective envelope to a depth at which O-18 is destroyed. This ''cool bottom processing'' mechanism on the AGE is similar to extra mixing mechanisms proposed to explain the excess C-13 (and depleted C-12) observed in the earlier RGB stage of evolution and the large Li-7 depletion observed in low-mass main-sequence stars.									110	1	0	0	0	0	111			0004-637X			WOS:A1995QM74800006

The polymer-colloidal IrO2 system photocatalytically reduced persulfate, a sacrificial electron acceptor, and oxidized water to O-2 and H+ in solutions that were buffered at pH 6 by Na2SiF6 and NaHCo3. The quantum efficiency for O-2 evolution and turnover number with respect to the Ru complex in the polymer reached 25% and 100, respectively. The polymer gradually aggregated in the Na2SiF6-NaHCO3 buffer during the reaction, and this aggregation gradually decreased the photocatalytic activity of the system. Heterogeneous photosystems composed of this polymer and colloidal IrO2 were also prepared using 70 nm diameter SiO2 particles as supports. Photocatalysts made by the sequential loading of colloidal IrO2 and the photosensitizer polymer onto SiO2 particles at ca. pH 6 had much lower photocatalytic activity than did the unsupported system, presumably because there was little physical contact between the polymer and colloidal IrO2 particles under these conditions. The most efficient heterogeneous photocatalyst was obtained by the adsorption of a mixture of the polymer and colloidal IrO2 onto SiO2 in Na2SiF6-NaHCO3 solution. This composite had a high activity, comparable to that of the polymer-colloidal IrO2 system. Transmission electron microscopy showed that the colloidal IrO2 particles were covered with the polymer, which had aggregated in the solution. This result indicates that the polymer-IrO2 aggregates retain their activity when immobilized on a support that might be used to organize overall water splitting systems.									85	1	0	0	9	0	88			0897-4756			WOS:000172889300042

In this study, a subset of genes in the brain of Takifugu rubripes were analyzed using digital gene expression (DGE) profiles and next-generation sequencing after acute hypoxia. Among 32 differentially expressed genes, 29 were up-regulated and 3 were down-regulated following hypoxia exposure. Using Gene Ontology analysis, it was found that transcription and translation, metabolism, and the stress response were affected by exposure to hypoxia. KEGG analysis revealed that the neuroactive ligand-receptor interaction pathway was significantly enriched in hypoxia-exposed T. rubripes. To further confirm the differential expression of genes, quantitative real-time PCR was performed to test six candidate genes, with the following five genes exhibiting the same expression patterns as the sequencing results: Proto-oncogene c-fos, Kruppel-like factor 2, immediate early response 2, proopiomelanocortin A and rhodopsin. This work is the first to identify and annotate genes in T. rubripes affected by hypoxia stress. This investigation provides data for understanding. the molecular mechanism of fish adaptation to hypoxia and provides a reference for rationally setting dissolved oxygen levels in aquaculture.									12	1	0	0	11	0	12			1744-117X	1878-0407		WOS:000414815200002	28787639

These WS2-SPEs were then rigorously tested towards the Hydrogen Evolution Reaction (HER) within an acidic media. The mass incorporation of 2D-WS2 into the 2D-WS2-SPEs was found to critically affect the observed HER catalysis with the larger mass incorporations resulting in more beneficial catalysis. The optimal (largest possible mass of 2D-WS2 incorporation) was the 2D-WS2-SPE40%, which displayed a HER onset potential, Tafel slope value and Turn over Frequency (ToF) of -214 mV (vs. RHE), 51.1 mV dec(-1) and 2.20 , respectively. These values significantly exceeded the HER catalysis of a bare/unmodified SPE, which had a HER onset and Tafel slope value of -459 mV (vs. RHE) and 118 mV dec(-1), respectively. Clearly, indicating a strong electrocatalytic response from the 2D-WS2-SPEs. An investigation of the signal stability of the 2D-WS2-SPEs was conducted by performing 1000 repeat cyclic voltammograms (CVs) using a 2D-WS2-SPE10% as a representative example. The 2D-WS2-SPE10% displayed remarkable stability with no variance in the HER onset potential of ca. -268 mV (vs. RHE) and a 44.4% increase in the achievable current over the duration of the 1000 CVs. The technique utilized to fabricate these 2D-WS2-SPEs can be implemented for a plethora of different materials in order to produce large numbers of uniform and highly reproducible electrodes with bespoke electrochemical signal outputs.									7	0	0	0	0	0	7				2046-2069		WOS:000481573800038	35528637

In this study, the effects of the evolutions of coal properties during nitrogen and MTE drying process on the spontaneous combustion behavior of Zhaotong lignite were systematically investigated. The samples were treated by nitrogen and MTE drying process to desired residual moisture contents, and the changes in pore structures, mineral matters and particle size of samples were analyzed. The test of spontaneous combustion behavior of the sample was carried out by wire basket method. It was found that the removal of water from lignite resulted in the decrease of crossing point temperature (CPT) indicating the promotion of spontaneous combustion susceptibility. The stabilization of pore structures by MTE process which inhibited the transform of macropores into smaller pores, resulted in a lower CPT compared to nitrogen dried samples with the same residual moisture content. The removal of mineral matters from lignite by MTE process also contributed to the decrease of CPT. The effect of particle size in a wide range (from < 0.2mm to 10-20 mm) on CPT was also studied. The CPT increased with the enlargement of particle size above the critical diameter, due to the less exposition of internal surface area and inhibited the oxygen diffusion to internal particle surface which inhibited the oxidation reactions. The inhibition on the spontaneous combustion of dried lignite by the MTE process was deprived from the large size of its products.									19	3	0	0	0	0	21			0016-2361	1873-7153		WOS:000438692100031		
J	Liu, Yuepeng; Zhao, Shuo; Wang, Yanyun; Xie, Liying; Fang, Jiasheng; Zhang, Yiwei; Zhou, Yuming; Zhuo, Shuping								Controllable fabrication of 3D porous carbon nitride with ultra-thin nanosheets templated by ionic liquid for highly efficient water splitting								INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY				46	49			25004	25014		10.1016/j.ijhydene.2021.05.018		JUL 2021		JUL 16 2021	2021	Modifying the texture of carbon nitride to adjust its physicochemical performance is a fascinating method for achieving high photocatalytic activity. Herein, we synthesized 3D porous carbon nitride with ultra-thin nanosheets by using cyanuric acid-melamine supramolecular and ionic liquid as precursor and template, respectively. The ionic liquid adjusts the morphology of materials and induces the carbon residue into the porous channels owing to its incomplete degradation. The 3D porous framework makes carbon nitride reflect the enhanced surface area, exposes adequate reaction sites, and offers a pathway for charge transport. And carbon residue and ultra-thin nanosheets further promote the photogenerated carriers transport and reduce the recombination rate of charge carriers. Consequently, 3D porous carbon nitride with ultra-thin nanosheets exhibit outstanding and stable hydrogen evolution under visible light irradiation. Significantly, as fabricated sample CN-100 reflects an improved H-2 generation rate, up to 17,028 mmol h(-1) g(-1), which is 12 times higher than that of CN (1412 mmol h(-1) g(-1)). The present work offers a unique synthesis strategy to develop the novel photocatalyst with efficient photocatalytic performance. (C) 2021 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

They were found to possess the good performances of hydrogen production. The use of the suitable carbon materials of a high surface area, AC and RGO, as the substrates for their efficient immobilization, as well as the addition of Nafion (R) as a polymer electrolyte, allowed to substantially increase an electrocatalytic activity of the corresponding clathrochelate-containing CP-based cathodes. Chemical design of the above metal-encapsulating cage molecules allowed a substantial decrease in a consumption of these metals by using their adsorbed monolayers. The high adsorptive capacities of the suitable carbon materials resulted in a substantial increase in a surface concentration of their electrocatalytically active centers, and, therefore, in that of an electrocatalytic activity of the obtained hybrid clathrochelate-containing carbon-based cathode materials.

High velocity oxygen fuel (HVOF) spraying was employed for coating deposition, and thermo-gravimetry analysis (TGA) was carried out to examine the oxidation kinetics at 600-800 degrees C. For comparison, the same experiments were performed on conventional micro/nanostructured WC-Co coatings (mc-WC and nc-WC). Oxidation resistance of Ni/mc-WC and Ni/nc-WC coatings at 800 degrees C was improved by 88.5% and 893% compared to me-WC and nc-WC coatings, respectively. Linear kinetics with activation energies of 90.4 and 78.9 kJ/mol were obtained for me-WC and nc-WC, respectively, while oxidation kinetics of Ni/mc-WC and Ni/nc-WC coatings obeyed the parabolic law with greater activation energies of 212 and 197.5 kymol.

Such structures, however, are conventionally prepared by deposition methods, which inherently suffer from costly and time-consuming drawbacks. Here, we report a simple one-step process to successfully construct a novel MNA with core-shell nanoparticles anchored at the heterointerface of dual-phase oxide substrates through a phase transition and in situ exsolution of perovskite La0.5Sr0.5Fe0.8Ni0.1Nb0.1O3-delta (LSFNNb0.1) in wet H-2 (3% H2O) at 800 degrees C. The core-shell nanoparticles are composed of a Ni-Fe alloy core and a SrLaFeO4-type layered perovskite oxide shell (RP-Ruddlesden-Popper-layered perovskites), which synergistically improves the electrochemical activity and effectively suppresses aggregation and coarsening of the metallic core. The RP phase also covers the surface of perovskite bulk (SP-single perovskite), forming the heterointerface and preventing further decomposition of the SP phase. The RP/SP heterointerface may improve the kinetics of surface exchange of oxygen species, resulting in the enhancement of performance and durability of the reduced LSFNNb0.1 as an anode for solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs). A doped zirconia electrolyte-supported single cell with the anode achieves the maximum power density (MPD) of 0.83 Omega cm(-2) at 800 degrees C in wet H-2, and the corresponding polarization resistance is as low as 0.15 Omega cm(2). This work reveals the formation mechanism of the MNA by investigating the evolution of the crystal structure, composition and morphology of LSFNNb0.1, when changing reducing temperature and time in wet H-2 and 5% H-2-Ar. The oxygen vacancies and phase transitions are found to play important roles in the formation of the MNA. The construction of MNAs in one step opens a new opportunity to design and prepare high-performance and stable catalysts for applications in energy conversion and storage.									7	0	0	0	0	0	7			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000558792700039	32657114

Lifetime measurements of (1)Chl* fluorescence by single photon counting and a numerical analysis of the redox reactions revealed (1) at exciton densities required for light saturation of the stable charge separation, annihilation processes dominate the excited state decay leading to very similar lifetimes of (1)Chl* in systems with open and closed reaction centers and (2) the difference of absorption changes induced by actinic flashes of comparatively high photon density in samples with open and photochemically closed reaction centers, respectively, provides a suitable measure of the rate constant of Q(A)(-) formation. Conclusion 2 was confirmed in PS II membrane fragments by measurements at three wavelengths (280 nm, 292 nm and 325 nm) where the difference spectrum of Q(A)(-) formation exhibits characteristic features. The numerical evaluation of the experimental data led to the following results: (1) the rate constant of Q(A)(-) formation was found to be (300 +/- 100 ps)(-1) in PS II membrane fragments and PS II core complexes deprived of the distal and proximal antenna and (2) an iron depletion treatment of membrane fragments does not affect these kinetics. The implications of these results are briefly discussed in terms of the PS II reaction pattern.									47	0	0	0	40	0	47			0031-8655			WOS:A1994NN88800012		
J	Velotta, Jonathan P.; Cheviron, Zachary A.								Remodeling Ancestral Phenotypic Plasticity in Local Adaptation: A New Framework to Explore the Role of Genetic Compensation in the Evolution of Homeostasis								INTEGRATIVE AND COMPARATIVE BIOLOGY				58	6			1098	1110		10.1093/icb/icy117				DEC 2018	2018	Phenotypic plasticity is not universally adaptive. In certain cases, plasticity can result in phenotypic shifts that reduce fitness relative to the un-induced state. A common cause of such maladaptive plasticity is the co-option of ancestral developmental and physiological response systems to meet novel challenges. Because these systems evolved to meet specific challenges in an ancestral environment (e.g., localized and transient hypoxia), their co-option to meet a similar, but novel, stressor (e.g., reductions in ambient pO(2) at high elevation) can lead to misdirected responses that reduce fitness. In such cases, natural selection should act to remodel phenotypic plasticity to suppress the expression of these maladaptive responses. Because these maladaptive responses reduce the fitness of colonizers in new environments, this remodeling of ancestral plasticity may be among the earliest steps in adaptive walks toward new local optima. Genetic compensation has been proposed as a general form of adaptive evolution that leads to the suppression of maladaptive plasticity to restore the ancestral trait value in the face of novel stimuli. Given their central role in the regulation of basic physiological functions, we argue that genetic compensation may often be achieved by modifications of homeostatic regulatory systems. We further suggest that genetic compensation to modify homeostatic systems can be achieved by two alternative strategies that differ in their mechanistic underpinnings; to our knowledge, these strategies have not been formally recognized by previous workers. We then consider how the mechanistic details of these alternative strategies may constrain their evolution. These considerations lead us to argue that genetic compensation is most likely to evolve by compensatory physiological changes that safeguard internal homeostatic conditions to prevent the expression of maladaptive portions of conserved reaction norms, rather than direct evolution of plasticity itself. Finally, we outline a simple experimental framework to test this hypothesis. Our goal is to stimulate research aimed at providing a deeper mechanistic understanding of whether and how phenotypic plasticity can be remodeled following environmental shifts that render ancestral responses maladaptive, an issue with increasing importance in our current era of rapid environmental change.									15	0	0	0	15	0	15			1540-7063	1557-7023		WOS:000456584300007	30272147	
J	Jeong, Joonseon; Kim, Choonsoo; Yoon, Jeyong								The effect of electrode material on the generation of oxidants and microbial inactivation in the electrochemical disinfection processes								WATER RESEARCH				43	4			895	901		10.1016/j.watres.2008.11.033				MAR 2009	2009	Electrochemical disinfection has gained increasing attention as an alternative for conventional drinking water treatment due to its high effectiveness and environmental compatibility. The most common method of electrochemical disinfection is the use of electro-generated oxidants, such as active chlorine and reactive oxygen species, as disinfectants. This study examined the role of electrode material on the generation of oxidants, and elucidated the different reaction pathways for generating individual oxidants by employing boron-doped diamond (BDD), Ti/RuO2, Ti/IrO2, Ti/Pt-IrO2, and Pt as anode materials. The efficiency of (OH)-O-center dot production, as determined by para-chlorobenzoic acid (pCBA) degradation, was in the order of BDD >> Ti/RuO2 approximate to Pt. No significant production of (OH)-O-center dot was observed at Ti/IrO2 and Ti/Pt-IrO2. The (OH)-O-center dot was found to play a key role in O-3 generation at BDD, but not at the other electrodes. The production of active chlorine was in the order of Ti/IrO2 > Ti/RuO2 > Ti/Pt-IrO2 > BDD > Pt. The large difference in this order from that of ROS was attributed to the difference in the electrocatalytic activity of each electrode material toward the production of active chlorine, as evidenced by linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) measurements. In addition, the characteristics of microbial inactivation as a function of electrode material were examined under the presence of an inert electrolyte, using Escherichia coli as an indicator microorganism.

J	Herbst-Johnstone, Mandy; Nicolau, Laura; Kilmartin, Paul A.					Kilmartin, Paul/0000-0003-2623-0958			Stability of Varietal Thiols in Commercial Sauvignon blanc Wines								AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ENOLOGY AND VITICULTURE				62	4			495	502		10.5344/ajev.2011.11023				2011	2011	The intense passion fruit-type aroma of New Zealand Sauvignon blanc wines, attributed to high concentrations of the varietal thiols 3-mercaptohexan-1-ol (3-MH) and 3-mercaptohexan-1-ol acetate (3-MHA), is known to diminish rapidly over just one year in the bottle. It is thus important to understand the processes by which the aroma compounds are lost during storage to improve the shelf life of these wines. The loss of varietal thiols has been linked to polyphenol oxidation, catalyzed by metals, a process that can be inhibited by antioxidants such as sulfur dioxide (SO2), ascorbic acid, and glutathione. The evolution of 3-MH and 3-M HA was monitored in commercially bottled New Zealand Sauvignon blanc wines, stored in the dark at 15 degrees C for 7 months, together with changes in polyphenol content and small molecule antioxidants. The acetate ester 3-MHA was the least stable of the varietal thiols and declined steadily in concentration following first-order kinetic decay, whereas 3-MH barely decreased over the first 3 months of bottle storage, and was instead followed by an increase in concentration after a further 4 months. These results pointed to hydrolysis of 3-MHA to 3-MH as the major loss mechanism in the commercial wines during the initial months of storage. Concomitantly, the flavan-3-ols exhibited a greater susceptibility to oxidation and polymerization reactions compared with the more stable hydroxycinnamic acids. Glutathione concentrations also declined steadily over the first year and would thus only provide protection against oxidative thiol losses up to that point. Free SO2 remained relatively stable in the commercially bottled Sauvignon blanc wines after an initial drop in concentration associated with oxygen entry at bottling.									43	0	0	0	36	2	43			0002-9254	1943-7749		WOS:000298125500008

MWNTs with intrinsic closed structure having the blocked hole and MWNTs with open structure were studied through hydrogen thermal desorption technique equipped with gas chromatograph. In order to grow MWNTs with open structure, novel method using oxygen added plasma(CH4/H-2/O-2) has been introduced. The structure of MWNTs was gradually changed with increasing oxygen addition amount, showing aligned MWNTs bundles and open tube cap at 10% oxygen addition. The precise analysis on thermal desorption spectra on MWNTs with closed structure showed that hydrogen gas was released at three major temperature ranges such as 100-230K, 290-350K, and 600-625K, where the evolved hydrogen amounts were about 1.65wt%, 0.64wt%, and 0.03wt%, respectively. However, in case of aligned and open MWNTs, the evolution peak around 290-350K was highly developed (about 1.9wt%) and the desorption peak at 600-625K was disappeared. The hydrogen desorption activation energy was also calculated. The obtained hydrogen desorption activation energy of MWNTs with closed and open structure at ambient temperature was -18.5kJ/mol H-2 and -16.5kJ/mol center dot H-2, respectively. The hydrogen desorbed between 290 and 330K in MWNTs with open structure was the hydrogen physi-sorbed in nano-hole. And Ni-doping (dispersion) effect on hydrogen storage properties was investigated comparatively. Ni nano-catalysts were expected to effectively dissociate hydrogen molecules in gas phase, providing atomic hydrogen possible to form chemical bonding on carbon surface. The metal nanoparticles were homogeneously dispersed using incipient wetness impregnation method. Hydrogen desorption spectra of MWNTs with Ni nanoparticles showed that about 2.8wt% of hydrogen was released in the range of 340-520K.					5th Pacific Rim International Conference on Advanced Materials and Processing5th Pacific Rim International Conference on Advanced Materials and Processing	NOV 02-05, 2004NOV 02-05, 2004	Chinese Soc Met; Japan Inst Met; Korea Inst Met & Mat; Minerals, Met & Mat SocChinese Soc Met; Japan Inst Met; Korea Inst Met & Mat; Minerals, Met & Mat Soc	Beijing, PEOPLES R CHINABeijing, PEOPLES R CHINA	9	0	0	0	0	0	9			0255-5476		0-87849-960-1	WOS:000227494702189

Herein, we have synthesized two important classes of newly emerging semiconductor nanocrystals (NCs) Ag3SbS3(SAS),i.e.hexagonal and monoclinic by simply tuning the solvent polarity, of which the second one has been synthesized in a phase pure NC for the first time by the thermal decomposition of silver and antimony based dithiocarbamate (similar to N-CS2-M) complexes. Interestingly, these two systems exhibit two different semiconducting (SC) properties and band gaps; hexagonal SAS has a p type (E-g similar to 1.65 eV) whereas monoclinic SAS has an n type (E-g similar to 2.1 eV) character. For the first time ever we have designed a reducing working electrode (i.e.cathode) by modifying the rotating disc electrode (RDE) with hexagonal SAS that exhibits excellent electrochemical oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activity (E-onset= 1.09 Vvs. RHE and average number of electron transfer: 3.89) comparable to that of the highly expensive Pt/C (E-onset= 0.88 Vvs.RHE and average number of electron transfer: 3.92). Density functional theory (DFT) investigation confirms the corroborations of experimental data with theoretical implications. In addition, the electrode fabricated from monoclinic SAS acts as an efficient photoanode which exhibits higher photoelectrochemical (PEC) methanol oxidation reaction (MOR) activity under illumination in alkaline medium compared to that of standard TiO(2)grown on an indium tin oxide (ITO) coated glass slide. On illumination, the relative photocurrent density at the onset potential has been obtained to be 845 which is a very significant experimental output with respect to any other TiO(2)or Pt@TiO(2)based photocatalysts for this application. The physicochemical stability and reusability of both materials were supported by 50 hours of extended electrochemical chronoamperometric measurements and powder XRD and the TEM analyses after electrocatalysis. This study explores a possible pathway for designing simple and less expensive but catalytically efficient silver based ternary sulfide NC systems for developing an SC material to reduce the energy crisis in the near future.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			1477-9226	1477-9234		WOS:000549100400033	32602491

Experimental investigations have been carried out on the transient temperature variation and inhomogeneity in a packed bed reactor with an aspect ratio of 9.5 and filled with particles with an average diameter of 4.53 mm for methane-copper/copper oxide chemical looping combustion (CLC). The bed temperature evolution and spatial variation at axial and radial positions were measured and analyzed for oxidation reaction. The development of axial temperature front is found to be much slower than in the fine particle situation in the literature that is typical in laboratory reactors. The axial temperature profile is also apparently diffusion like, instead of being almost a discontinuously sudden change in fine particle reactors. The phenomena indicate that internal diffusion significantly influences heat transfer in the situation of the large particle size. Wall effects and radial temperature variation in this low aspect ratio reactor were analyzed as well; the reactor experiences strong non uniform radial temperature distribution, and channeling flow affects significantly the near wall temperature profile. A 2D unsteady pseudo homogeneous effective parameter model with radial and axial dispersion was developed to predict the transient heat transfer in the CLC process. A radially variable heat source term was added to the model to represent the effects of the non-uniform distribution of oxygen carrier material in the radial direction. The model predicts qualitatively reasonable 2D temperature distribution, especially the large radial temperature gradient which has been observed in the experiments. The predicted temperature front was a very abrupt change like a discontinuity face which is apparently different from the measured one in the experiments. Without including influences of the wall effects in the model, the used effective thermal conductivities were considered to be underestimated for conditions in the present study.

Photooxidation of gland hormones of the thyronine (TN) family and structurally related compounds (TN, 3,5-diiodothyronine,3,3',5-triiodothyronine and 3,3',5,5'-tetraiodothyronine or thyroxine) was studied using rose bengal, eosin and perinaphthenone (PN) as dye sensitizers. Tyrosine (Tyr) and two iodinated derivatives (3-iodotyrosine and 3,5-diiodotyrosine) were also included in the study for comparative purposes. Irradiation of aqueous solutions of substrates containing xanthene dyes with visible light triggers a complex series of competitive interactions, which include the triplet excited state of the dye ((3)Xdye*) and singlet molecular oxygen [O-2((1)Delta(g))]-mediated and superoxide ion-mediated reactions. Rate constants for interaction with the (3)Xdye*, attributed to an electron transfer process, are in the order of 10(8)-10(9) M-1 s(-1) depending on the dye and the particular substrate. The photosensitization using PN follows a pure Type-II (O-2((1)Delta(g)) mediated) mechanism. The presence of the phenolic group in Tyr, TN and iodinated derivatives dominates the kinetics of photooxidation of these compounds. The reactive rate constants, k(r), and the quotient between reactive and overall rate constants (k(r)/k(t) values, in the range of 0.7-0.06) behave in an opposite fashion compared with the overall rate constants and oxidation potentials. This apparent inconsistency was interpreted on the basis of an internal heavy atom effect, favoring the intersystem-crossing deactivation route within the encounter complex with the concomitant reduction of effective photooxidation.									12	0	0	0	7	0	12			0031-8655	1751-1097		WOS:000228463500013	15643926

While other procedures require harsh synthesis conditions and multiple reaction steps, this method involves ultrasonication of commercially available powders in aqueous surfactant solutions and so is relatively mild and potentially scalable. Such mild exfoliation is possible because the surface energy of Ni(OH)(2), as measured by inverse gas chromatography, is relatively low at similar to 70 mJ m (2), similar to other layered materials. TEM, AFM, XPS and Raman spectroscopy show the exfoliated nanosheets to be relatively thin (mean similar to 10 monolayers thick) and of good quality. Size selection by liquid cascade centrifugation allowed the production of samples with mean nanosheet lengths ranging from 55 to 195 nm. Optical measurements on dispersions showed the optical absorption coefficient spectra to be relatively invariant with nanosheet size while the scattering coefficient spectra varied strongly with size. The resultant size-dependence allows the extinction spectra to be used to estimate nanosheet size as well as concentration. We used the exfoliated nanosheets to prepare thin film electrodes for use in supercapacitors and as oxygen evolution catalysts. While the resultant capacitance was reasonably high at similar to 1200 F cm(-3) (20 mV s(-1)), the catalytic performance was exceptional with currents of 10 mA cm(-2) observed at overpotentials as low as 297 mV, close to the state of the art.									59	1	0	0	2	0	62			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000379473100036

Protein conformational changes may be involved in the process of D1 degradation. In the present study, we determined the effect of H2O2 On spinach PS II-enriched membranes and core complexes with respect to electron transport, Mn content and protein secondary structural changes as measured by Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy. H2O2 is effective in removing catalytic Mn in PS II, especially in PS II core complexes depleted of OEC18 and OEC24, impairing the donor-side. By quantitative analysis of the amide I band (1600 - 1700 cm(-1)) with both aqueous and dehydrated PS II samples, we found that no significant secondary structural changes are associated with H2O2 treatment in the dark, even though there is some cleavage of the D1 protein by H2O2 treatment as determined by Western analysis with specific antibodies. In contrast, a large decrease in the alpha-helices in the PS II core occurs, with or without H2O2 treatment, after 20 min strong illumination and there is more extensive degradation of the D1 protein. Our results suggest that high light enhances the cleavage of the D1 protein which is reflected in the large protein secondary structural changes in PS II detected by FTIR measurements.									6	0	0	0	5	0	6			0166-8595	1573-5079		WOS:A1997XY12800003

Thermal analysis, coupled with FTIR spectroscopy, has evidenced the formation of a mixture of magnetite and maghemite, with a higher content of magnetite in case of the powder synthesized with benzylamine. The stability of magnetite at oxidation by air during storage at room temperature and 60 degrees C was investigated by means of TG/DSC simultaneous thermal analysis, FTIR spectroscopy and X-ray diffractometry. Thermal analysis evidenced an exothermic process with mass gain in temperature range 100-190 degrees C, corresponding to magnetite oxidation process, but due to the superposition of other processes it could not offer quantitative information. FTIR spectroscopy has provided, especially through the first and second derivatives of FTIR spectra, the most valuable information regarding the evolution of magnetite to maghemite, due to their different characteristic bands. XRD technique has evidenced a slight shift of the main diffraction peaks at higher 2-theta values during the evolution of magnetite to maghemite. According to thermal analysis data, the powder synthesized with ammonia was completely oxidized after 15 days, while the other two powders, synthesized with benzylamine and sodium hydroxide, were completely oxidized after 110 days of keeping in air at room temperature. For a temperature of 60 degrees C, the oxidation was much faster; the oxidation process of the powder synthesized with benzylamine disappeared from TG/DSC curves after 1 day. All final powders were formed from nanoparticles with diameters up to 25 nm, with magnetic properties characteristic to nanometric maghemite.									72	0	0	0	18	0	72			1388-6150	1588-2926		WOS:000383142000021

However, the main drawback of PbS NPLs is the large lateral size, which inhibits their further investigations and practical applications. In this work, ultra-small 2D PbS NPLs with uniform lateral size (11.2 +/- 1.7 nm) and thickness (3.7 +/- 0.9 nm, approximate to 6 layers) have been successfully fabricated by a facile liquid-phase exfoliation approach. Their transient optical response and photo-response behavior are evaluated by femtosecond-resolved transient absorption and photo-electrochemical (PEC) measurements. It is shown that the NPLs-based photodetectors (PDs) exhibit excellent photo-response performance from UV to the visible range, showing extremely high photo-responsivity (27.81 mA W-1) and remarkable detectivity (3.96 x 10(10) Jones), which are figures of merit outperforming currently reported PEC-type PDs. The outstanding properties are further analyzed based on the results of first-principle calculations, including electronic band structure and free energies for the oxygen evolution reaction process. This work highlights promising applications of ultra-small 2D PbS NPLs with the potential for breakthrough developments also in other fields of optoelectronic devices.									23	0	0	0	0	0	23			1613-6810	1613-6829		WOS:000607600900001	33448145

NaCl caused a decrease in photosystem II (PSII) mediated oxygen evolution activity and increase in photosystem I (PSI) activity and the amount of P700. Similarly maximal efficiency of PSII (Fv/Fm) and variable fluorescence (Fv/Fo) were also declined in salt-stressed cells. Western blot analysis reveal that the inhibition in PSII activity is due to a 40% loss of a thylakoid membrane protein, known as D1, which is located in PSI I reaction center. NaCl treatment of cells also resulted in the alterations of other thylakoid membrane proteins: most prominently, a dramatic diminishment of the 47-kDa chlorophyll protein (CP) and 94-kDa protein, and accumulation of a 17-kDa protein band were observed in SDS-PAGE. The changes in 47-kDa and 94-kDa proteins lead to the decreased energy transfer from light harvesting antenna to PSII, which was accompanied by alterations in the chlorophyll fluorescence emission spectra of whole cells and isolated thylakoids. Therefore we conclude that salt stress has various effects on photosynthetic electron transport activities due to the marked alterations in the composition of thylakoid membrane proteins.									97	2	0	0	87	3	103			1225-8687			WOS:000230910100015	16053716

We cloned two different GPx genes from Penaeus monodon (black tiger shrimp). Bioinformatics sequence analysis showed that PmGPx1 and PmGPx7 encoded polypeptides of 207 and 208 amino acids, respectively. PmGPx1 has a selenocysteine residue that is encoded by an opal codon 187TGA189. The PmGPx1 and PmGPx7 expression profiles were detected in the gills and hepatopancreas of the shrimps under osmotic stress, heavy metal exposure and bacterial infection, and the results suggested that PmGPx1 and PmGPx7 are involved in the responses to these stimuli. The recombinant PmGPx1 and PmGPx7 protein was expressed and purified through affinity chromatography and was refolded successfully using ion-exchange chromatography, which were used to measure antioxidant activity, and the results revealed that the rPmGPxl and rPmGPx7 protein could catalyze the redox reaction between GSH and H2O2. This study provides useful information to help further understand the functional mechanism of the GPx family in the immunity of P. monodon.									13	3	0	0	11	0	15			1096-4959	1879-1107		WOS:000424720400001	29246783

Evaluation of sputtered nickel oxide, cobalt oxide and nickel-cobalt oxide on n-type silicon photoanodes for solar-driven O-2(g) evolution from water								JOURNAL OF MATERIALS CHEMISTRY A				8	28			13955	13963		10.1039/d0ta03725g				JUL 28 2020	2020	Thin films of nickel oxide (NiOx), cobalt oxide (CoOx) and nickel-cobalt oxide (NiCoOx) were sputtered onto n-Si(111) surfaces to produce a series of integrated, protected Si photoanodes that did not require deposition of a separate heterogeneous electrocatalyst for water oxidation. The p-type transparent conductive oxides (p-TCOs) acted as multi-functional transparent, antireflective, electrically conductive, chemically stable coatings that also were active electrocatalysts for the oxidation of water to O-2(g). Relative to the formal potential for water oxidation to O-2,E-o '(O-2/H2O), under simulated Air Mass (AM)1.5 illumination the p-TCO-coated n-Si(111) photoanodes produced mutually similar open-circuit potentials of -270 +/- 20 mV, but different photocurrent densities atE(o)'(O-2/H2O), of 28 +/- 0.3 mA cm(-2)for NiOx, 18 +/- 0.3 mA cm(-2)for CoO(x)and 24 +/- 0.5 mA cm(-2)for NiCoOx. The p-TCOs all provided protection from oxide growth for extended time periods, and produced stable photocurrent densities from n-Si in 1.0 M KOH(aq) (ACS grade) under potential control atE(o)'(O-2/H2O) for >400 h of continuous operation under 100 mW cm(-2)of simulated AM1.5 illumination.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000551538000008

Therefore, it is of great significance to build a stable AEI enabling a long lifetime for ZIBs. Herein, trace tea polyphenols (TP) were introduced firstly as additive of zinc acetate electrolyte to protect zinc anode from corrosion invasion and boost uniform zinc deposition, thus achieving reversible dendrite-free zinc anode. In situ synchrotron radiation Xray imaging was conducted to illustrate the positive role of TP molecules in the uniform plating process of zinc. The stable AEI induced by the specific adsorption of TP molecules reduced hydrogen and oxygen evolution side reactions and increased the coulombic efficiency. The TP additive with an ultralow dosage of 0.028 g L-1 delivered favorable cycling stability of 720 h at 0.5 mA cm-2 and 0.5 mAh cm-2. The ZnNa3V2(PO4)3 full cell assembled with the hybrid Zn(Ac)2-TP electrolyte contributed an energy density of 130 mAh g-1 at the current density of 0.2C and enhanced cycling stability of 78% retention after 300 cycles. These results will provide new insights into additive engineering for aqueous electrolytes and the fundamental understanding of AEI phenomena for high performance ZIBs. (c) 2022 Elsevier Inc.

J	Lammer, H; Stumptner, W; Bauer, SJ					Bauer, Siegfried/0000-0003-4213-2047			Upper limits for the Martian exospheric number density during the Planet B/Nozomi mission								PLANETARY AND SPACE SCIENCE				48	15			1473	1478		10.1016/S0032-0633(00)00095-7				DEC 2000	2000	Dissociative recombination (DR) of ionospheric O-2(+) ions is an important source of suprathermal atomic oxygen in the exosphere as previous studies about the Martian upper atmosphere have shown. Because of the weaker gravitational attraction a hot oxygen corona on Mars should be denser than that observed on Venus. Since the most important mechanism for the production of the hot oxygen atoms in the Martian exosphere is DR, we investigated the variability of this production mechanism depending on solar activity. The Japanese Nozomi spacecraft will have the possibility to detect with the neutral mass spectrometer (NMS) for the first time in-situ the theoretically predicted hot oxygen corona on Mars, if the corona number density above the cold background atmosphere is of the order of 10,000 cm(-3). Due to a problem in the propulsion system Nozomi failed its planned arrival rendezvous with Mars in October 1999 and will, therefore, arrive at the red planet not before January 2004. Solar activity will reach its maximum in 2001, so the related production rate of hot oxygen atoms will be in the medium range during the new arrival date of Nozomi. We used the ionospheric profiles from the Viking mission for low solar activity conditions (F-10.7 approximate to 70) and the Mariner 9 mission with a solar activity of about 120 for medium solar wind activity. The latter is comparable to the level we expect for the Mars arrival of Nozomi. The resulting influence of the hot oxygen corona number density distribution was calculated with a Monte Carlo technique. This technique is used to compute a hot particle density distribution function. We studied the atomic diffusion process in the Martian atmosphere by simulating the collision probability, particle direction and energy loss after collisions by generating random numbers. Compared to previous studies we have improved the Monte Carlo model by using more and smaller altitude steps and more detailed treatment of particles with a temporary downward motion. This has resulted in an increased amount of collisions and a shift to lower energies in the energy spectrum. Our results show that the hot oxygen component should begin to dominate above the cold background atmosphere at an altitude of about 500 km above the Martian surface. The NMS instrument on board of Nozomi should detect the hot oxygen component after its arrival at Mars in January 2004, at an altitude of about 600 km above the Martian surface. Since the solar activity will decrease during the mission the measurements during the first orbits will be the most significant ones. The first in-situ measurements of the hot oxygen number density would be very important for adjusting atmospheric escape models by separating ballistic, satellite and escape trajectories of the hot oxygen atoms, which are significant for studies of the evolution and solar wind interaction of the Martian atmosphere.

As one of the advanced oxidation technologies, three-dimensional electrochemical system (3DES) is often used to treat industrial wastewater that is difficult to degrade. Sulphonated phenolic resin (SMP) was treated as a characteristic pollutant in sulfonated drilling wastewater. The separate effect of current, the dosage of particle electrodes, chloride ion concentration and initial pH on chlorinated by-products were analyzed by the response surface methodology (RSM). Results showed that the current is the most dominant factor, followed by the dosage of particle electrodes. The ultraviolet-electrolysis (UVEL) system was implemented by adding ultraviolet light under the optimal electrolysis (EL) system. The chemical oxygen demand (CODcr) and total organic carbon (TOC) removal rates of the UVEL system were respectively increased by 19% and 29.39% compared with the EL system, the concentration of chlorinated by-products was also reduced by 534.4 mg/L when the UV irradiance was 5.24 mW/cm(2). These results indicated that the UVEL system degrades SMP more thoroughly. The enhanced reaction mechanism of UVEL system and the possible degradation pathway for SMP were proposed via controlling free radical quenching experiments and the product of EL and UVEL processes. The results showed that the high degradation efficiency of the UVEL system can be attributed to the synergistic degradation mechanism present in the UVEL system, where the photolysis of active chlorine species (ACl) promotes the increase of hydroxyl radical ((<bold>)</bold>OH).									1	0	0	0	1	0	1			0273-1223	1996-9732		WOS:000713337100001	34928828

The goal of this study is to model geochemical evolution of water chemistry from the infiltration through soil into the unsaturated zone, transport through bedrocks and granular aquifers to a river in order to identify zones of steep concentration gradients and high dynamics under transient flow conditions. A numerical model was constructed comprising a 2-D 1,500 m x 150 m vertical cross-section of typical sedimentary rock formations, a glacio-fluvial quaternary gravel aquifer in the valley and soil layers. The model coupled saturated/un-saturated flow and reactive transport under steady state and transient conditions. Geochemical interactions, include intra-aqueous kinetic reactions of oxygen with dissolved organic matter, as well as kinetics of carbonate dissolution/precipitation. This model section was chosen to provide insight in to the principal processes and time scales affecting water chemistry along different flow paths. The numerical simulator MIN3P was used, a finite volume program for variably saturated subsurface flow and multi-component reactive transport. The results show that subsurface water residence times range from approximately 2 to 2,000 years. Different zones are to be expected with respect to the development of mineral equilibria; namely, purely atmospherically influenced, as well as open and closed system carbonate dissolution. Short-term responses to daily averaged changes in precipitation, however, are only visible to some extent in the shallower and near-river parts of flow system and solute loads. This can most likely be explained by directional changes in flow paths, indicating that equilibrium geochemical condition predominate at the hillslope scale, i.e. water quality depends on transport pathways rather than on kinetic effects. The extent of reducing conditions is controlled by the presence of organic-rich layers (i.e. peat deposits), the dissolution kinetics of aquifer organic matter and the subsequent mixing with oxygenated water by hydrodynamic dispersion.									10	0	0	0	4	0	10			1866-6280	1866-6299		WOS:000318280400010

Each of the chambers comprises components capable of gas exchange. The test sample has an unknown level of micro-organism activity and the reference sample has a known level of micro-organism activity. The sampled are introduce into chambers in receptacles (8a, 8b). USE - For determining the gas exchange of test sample useful in monitoring biocide efficacy; useful for detection of the presence of micro-organisms in natural and synthetic latex, cosmetic and paint samples, the effect of an additional substance upon a microorganism and/or the rate at which oxygen is consumed, in solutions, aqueous emulsions and/or suspensions; useful in fields including medical field, environmental field, and domestic applications. ADVANTAGE - The method achieves a rapid measurement of microbiological activity and is sufficiently sensitive to detect low levels of microbiological activity without the need for a cultivating or concentration step. The method is capable of monitoring gas uptake, evolution or exchange of a sample comprising biological or chemical components at extremely low levels by continuously monitoring the pressure difference between the reference chamber and test chamber and the rate at which it occurs. The increased sensitivity removes the need for a cultivating or concentration step, which helps to speed up the preparation of the test, and enables the method to achieve detection nearly 600 times faster than traditional microbiological culturing. The method can provide the user with significantly more information with respect to the sample's components, such as the enzyme-substrate reaction kinetics, the time required to modify a bacteria culture's respiration, the uptake of oxygen prior to release of carbon dioxide, inhibition or enhancement of respiration following addition of biocide, antibiotic or nutrient, etc. The simultaneous use of the reference chamber containing a reference (or control sample) having a similar matrix to the test sample helps to eliminate any errors resulting from variations in conditions that may occur if the samples were analyzed separately.

J	Petersen, BO; Shuman, S								Histidine 265 is important for covalent catalysis by vaccinia topoisomerase and is conserved in all eukaryotic type I enzymes								JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL CHEMISTRY				272	7			3891	3896		10.1074/jbc.272.7.3891				FEB 14 1997	1997	Vaccinia topoisomerase catalyzes DNA cleavage and rejoining via transesterification to pentapyrimidine recognition site 5'-(CPT)CCTT down arrow in duplex DNA. The proposed reaction mechanism involves general-base catalysis of the attack by active site nucleophile Tyr-274 on the scissile phosphodiester and general-acid catalysis of the expulsion of the 5'-deoxyribose oxygen on the leaving DNA strand, The pK(a) values suggest histidine and cysteine side chains as candidates for the roles of proton acceptor and donor, respectively, To test this, we replaced each of the eight histidines and two cysteines of the vaccinia topoisomerase with alanine, Single mutants C100A and C211A and a double mutant C100A-C211A were fully active in DNA relaxation, indicating that a cysteine is not the general acid, Only one histidine mutation, H265A, affected enzyme activity, The rates of DNA relaxation, single-turnover strand cleavage, and single-turnover religation by H265A were 2 orders of magnitude lower than the wild-type rates, Yet the H265A mutation did not alter the dependence of the cleavage rate on pH, indicating that His-265 is not the general base, Replacing His-265 with glutamine or asparagine slowed DNA relaxation and single-turnover cleavage to about one-third of the wild-type rate, All three mutations, H265A, H265N, and H265Q, skewed the cleavage-religation equilibrium in favor of the covalently bound state, His-265 is strictly conserved in every member of the eukaryotic type I topoisomerase family.									53	0	0	0	50	0	63			0021-9258			WOS:A1997WH01900006	9020090

Effect of oxide dispersoids on precipitation-strengthened Al-1.7Zr (wt %) alloys produced by laser powder-bed fusion								ADDITIVE MANUFACTURING				56						102933	10.1016/j.addma.2022.102933				AUG 2022	2022	Binary Al-1.7 wt % Zr (Al-0.5 at % Zr) alloys, with and without 1 wt % (0.7 vol %) Al2O3 nanoparticle additions (80-100 nm), are fabricated by laser powder-bed fusion (L-PBF) from blends of Al, Zr, and Al2O3 powders. Elemental Zr, which is similar to 80 % dissolved in the melt pool, forms primary L1(2)-Al3Zr precipitates upon solidification and is also retained in a supersaturated solid solution in the Al matrix. The primary L1(2)-Al3Zr phase takes three forms: (i) discrete, micron-sized precipitates that nucleate fine Al matrix grains, (ii) elongated "strings " of submicron precipitates forming in highly enriched Zr regions, and (iii) < 100 nm precipitates within fine Al-grains. The Al2O3 nanodispersoid additions are either lost to slag or entrapped within Al-grains as oxide dis-persoids, resulting in an oxide concentration of 0.46 wt % for the modified ODS alloy. Al2O3 nanoscale dis-persoids (0.28 wt %) are also observed in the unmodified alloy, and are assumed to originate from (i) native oxides from the surface of the Al powder particles, and/or (ii) reaction with trace amounts of oxygen in the processing environment. The hardness upon aging at 400 C reaches a peak value of-750-850 MPa after 1.5 h, consistent with precipitation of secondary L1(2)-Al3Zr nanoprecipitates. Upon overaging, hardness slowly de-creases to 500 MPa (the as-processed value) after 1,500 h at 400 C, with no difference observed between the Al -Zr and Al-Zr-Al2O3 alloys. Strengthening mechanisms combines Hall-Petch strengthening from micron-sized grains, Zr solid-solution strengthening, and secondary L1(2)-Al3Zr precipitate strengthening, with slow precipi-tate coarsening and effective grain pinning by Al3Zr precipitates and oxide dispersoids located at grain bound-aries. Creep resistance is comparable for both alloys, which show threshold stresses of ~15 and 6 MPa, at 300 and 400 C respectively. Oxygen content analysis is recommended for all Al-based alloys fabricated via L-PBF due to the potential for non-reproducible nanoscale oxide inclusions (from native oxide on Al powders and from reaction with residual oxygen), which may affect the mechanical properties of the alloys, but are difficult to observe via SEM or TEM analysis.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2214-8604	2214-7810		WOS:000809655800002		
J	Wiersma-Koch, Helen; Sunden, Fanny; Herschlag, Daniel								Site-Directed Mutagenesis Maps Interactions That Enhance Cognate and Limit Promiscuous Catalysis by an Alkaline Phosphatase Superfamily Phosphodiesterase								BIOCHEMISTRY				52	51			9167	9176		10.1021/bi4010045				DEC 24 2013	2013	Catalytic promiscuity, an evolutionary concept, also provides a powerful tool for gaining mechanistic insights into enzymatic reactions. Members of the alkaline phosphatase (AP) superfamily are highly amenable to such investigation, with several members having been shown to exhibit promiscuous activity for the cognate reactions of other superfamily members. Previous work has shown that nucleotide pyrophosphatase/phosphodiesterase (NPP) exhibits a >10(6)-fold preference for the hydrolysis of phosphate diesters over phosphate monoesters, and that the reaction specificity is reduced 10(3)-fold when the size of the substituent on the transferred phosphoryl group of phosphate diester substrates is reduced to a methyl group. Here we show additional specificity contributions from the binding pocket for this substituent (herein termed the R' substituent) that account for an additional similar to 250-fold differential specificity with the minimal methyl substituent. Removal of four hydrophobic side chains suggested on the basis of structural inspection to interact favorably with R' substituents decreases phosphate diester reactivity 10(4)-fold with an optimal diester substrate (R' = 5'-deoxythymidine) and SO-fold with a minimal diester substrate (R' = CH3). These mutations also enhance the enzyme's promiscuous phosphate monoesterase activity by nearly an order of magnitude, an effect that is traced by mutation to the reduction of unfavorable interactions with the two residues closest to the nonbridging phosphoryl oxygen atoms. The quadruple R' pocket mutant exhibits the same activity toward phosphate diester and phosphate monoester substrates that have identical leaving groups, with substantial rate enhancements of similar to 10(11)-fold. This observation suggests that the Zn2+ bimetallo core of AP superfamily enzymes, which is equipotent in phosphate monoester and diester catalysis, has the potential to become specialized for the hydrolysis of each class of phosphate esters via addition of side chains that interact with the substrate atoms and substituents that project away from the Zn2+ bimetallo core.									10	0	0	0	10	0	10			0006-2960			WOS:000329137200009	24261692

Ti2AlC was found to be a highly stable substrate in sulfuric acid solutions due to the formation of a passivating oxide layer on the surface, which was confirmed by the X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis of as-prepared and anodically treated Ti2AlC samples. Ru films were electrodeposited onto Ti2AlC substrates by cycling the potential of Ti2AlC in the solution containing 0.01 mol dm(-3) RuCl3 + 0.1 mol dm(-3) H2SO4 between -0.5 V and 0.4 V vs. a saturated calomel electrode (SCE) at the sweep rate of 20 mV s(-1). Four Ru/Ti2AlC samples were prepared, obtained at 5, 10, 15 and 20 cycles of Ru electrodeposition. Characterization of samples was performed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and cyclic voltammetry (CV), while the thickness of the electrodeposited Ru layers was determined by atomic force microscopy (AFM). It was found that the most compact sample with the thickness of about 0.42 mu m was obtained after 5 cycles. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and steady-state polarization measurements showed that all Ru/Ti2AlC electrodes were exceptionally active for the HER. A Tafel slope of about -60 mV dec(-1) was observed on all polarization curves in the range of high cathodic current densities. Based on formal kinetics analysis, an appropriate mechanism for the HER on Ru/Ti2AlC was suggested. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

J	Chen, Shiguo; Yang, Juan; Zhang, Mansong; Strasser, Reto Joerg; Qiang, Sheng				Qiang, Sheng/A-6161-2012				Classification and characteristics of heat tolerance in Ageratina adenophora populations using fast chlorophyll a fluorescence rise O-J-I-P								ENVIRONMENTAL AND EXPERIMENTAL BOTANY				122				126	140		10.1016/j.envexpbot.2015.09.011				FEB 2016	2016	Croftonweed originated from Mexico is a worldwide notorious invasive weed. The objectives of this study were to screen heat tolerance in different croftonweed populations, determine the effect of heat stress on two photosystems and probe the mechanism of acquired heat tolerance. According to conventional tests of plant injury and fast chlorophyll fluorescence rise kinetics, four different croftonweed populations collected from South China were successfully classified into three categories by exposing whole plants to heat treatment at 40 degrees C: sensitive, intermediate, tolerant. Evidence from the JIP-test indicated that inhibition of the oxygen evolution complexes (OEC) and inactivation of PSII reaction centers (RCs) were the primary cause of heat damage. In mild heat stress (<40 degrees C), slightly damaged the OEC without creating a visible K-step in the fluorescence rise OJIP curve. In moderate heat stress or stronger (>= 40 degrees C), a pronounced K-step due to irreversible severe damage on the OEC occurred. Additionally, inactivation of PSII RCs, down-regulation of energetic connectivity of PSII units, destruction of PSII antenna architecture, losing overall photosynthetic activity of PSII, increase of PSI activity also took place. Furthermore, the tolerant population had lesser damage degree on photosynthetic capacity relative to intermediate and sensitive populations. Finally, a reliable model, based on the most sensitive parameter PIABS and V-K as a characteristic parameter for heat stress, is presented for ranking and identifying heat tolerance in different croftonweed populations. The heat sensitivity index (HSI) is also introduced as an indicator of plant heat sensitivity. The smaller the HSI value is, the higher the level of tolerance to heat stress is. We also found that the tolerance degree of four croftonweed populations to heat stress is significantly correlated to the extreme high temperature. This indicates that acquired heat tolerance in croftonweed populations results from plant adaptation to ambient high temperatures. Acquirement of heat tolerance confers a possible risk for croftonweed to spread further to currently hotter areas. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Here we studied the UV-B sensitivity of Photosystem II in different oxidation states, called S-states of the water-oxidizing complex. Photosystem II centers of isolated spinach thylakoids were synchronized to different distributions of the S-0, S-1, S-2 and S-3 states by using packages of visible light flashes and were exposed to UV-B flashes from an excimer laser (lambda =308 nm). The loss of oxygen evolving activity showed that the extent of UV-B damage is S-state-dependent. Analysis of the data obtained from different synchronizing flash protocols indicated that the UV-sensitivity of Photosystem II is significantly higher in the S-3 and S-2 states than in the S-1 and S-0 states. The data are discussed in terms of a model where UV-B-induced inhibition of water oxidation is caused either by direct absorption within the catalytic manganese cluster or by damaging intermediates of the water oxidation process.

It is still controversial, however, whether photoinactivation of photosystem II is completely avoided in high light-acclimated grapevines growing in the field. This study examines the functional stability of PSII in leaf discs (floated on water) of field-grown, high light-acclimated grapevines as a function of photon exposure. Measuring functional PSII units by flash-induced oxygen evolution, it was found that the susceptibility of PSII to photoinactivation was less in sun-exposed leaves than shade leaves of Vitis riparia Michaux, and enhanced by lincomycin, an inhibitor of chloroplast-encoded protein synthesis. Vitis vinifera L. cv. Chardonnay, grown in a glasshouse with slightly lower irradiance, exhibited an intermediate susceptibility. Significantly, the dark-relaxed quantum efficiency of PSII, measured as (F-m-F-o)/F-m, where F-m and F-o are the chlorophyll (Chl) fluorescence yields for closed and open reaction centres, respectively, declined much more slowly than did the number of functional PSII units in V. riparia. Thus, measurements of (F-m-F-o)/F-m may give an impression of little photoinactivation of PSII, even when nearly half of functional PSII units may be lost. By contrast, the parameter 1/F-o-1/F-m is a more linear indicator of functional PSII units. The results indicate that grapevines may suffer photoinactivation of PSII, at least when leaf discs are floated on water.									39	0	0	0	36	1	39			0310-7841			WOS:000170594100003

The resulting Ir-Ni/GC electrodes have been subjected to electrochemical treatment to ensure uncovered Ni anodic dissolution and film re-organisation into an Ir shell Ir-Ni core structure (denoted as Ir(Ni)/GC). The existence of a thin Ir shell and an Ir-Ni core has been confirmed by surface voltammetry in deaerated acid (which showed pure Ir characteristics), sputter-etch XPS experiments (which confirmed surface enrichment in Ir and depletion of Ni) and EDS results (which gave a ca. 3.5 Ir divided by Ni atom ratio in the bimetallic material). The Ir(Ni)/GC electrodes have been tested as cathodes for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) from acid solutions by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and steady-state current-potential measurements and exhibited a significant increase in intrinsic catalytic activity when compared to bulk Ir electrodes. This has been attributed to the effect of the Ni underlayers on H adsorption affinity of the Ir shell.									20	1	0	0	0	0	20			1572-6657	1873-2569		WOS:000423650000004

In this work, simple steps for fabrication and transformation of metallic tungsten thin film into the photo-active Magneli-phase (W18O49) of tungsten oxide thin film is demonstrated. The post-annealing temperature has a significant impact on the phase evolution of tungsten film into W18O49. The film thickness of W(18)O(49)is controlled by controlling the sputtering time (or deposition time) of W film. The PEC performance of the as-prepared electrodes is evaluated by monitoring the water oxidation reaction under visible radiation. The PEC findings reveal a correlation between PEC performance and phase, morphology, and thickness of the film. The as-derived W(18)O(49)can efficiently catalyze the water oxidation reaction at neutral solution pH, generating 0.6 and 1.4 mA cm(-1)photo-current at 0.6 and 0.8 V vs. Saturated calomel electrode (SCE), respectively, in addition to excellent stability. The electrical conductivity and the charge transfer kinetics are investigated employing the electrochemical impedance spectroscopic (EIS) technique.									12	0	0	0	1	0	12				2073-4344		WOS:000546007000044

Throughout this period, regulatory oversight influenced many aspects of product development. The approach to demonstrating efficacy was an important example. I will review some events of the decade so that we may consider the question, "If we had it to do over again could we do any better?"At the start of the decade, there were sufficient data on the mechanism of hemoglobin-induced renal toxicity to reach consensus among investigators that the content of alpha beta-dimers in any hemoglobin product must be strictly limited. An array of additional, unexpected reactions were seen in early clinical studies, reactions that led to several conclusions: hemoglobin is a pharmacologically active material; more basic studies are needed; and it would all be so much easier if communications between investigators were open and unhindered.Meaningful studies of efficacy could not be approached until the safety issues had been solved or until the community was convinced that they were not serious. The initial approach was based on the meager experience gained with previous products, e.g., Fluosol. That experience led to policies which required that, for example, if the product was to be used as a red cell substitute, it must be compared with red cells, and if it was to be used as an oxygen carrier, it must be shown to support organ function. Endpoints of clinical trials were based on delivery of a clear clinical benefit to the patient - surrogate endpoints could be used only if their relationship to clinical benefit had been demonstrated.Now, as we approach the end of the decade, it is time to ask whether progress would have been greater had policies regarding demonstration of efficacy been different. That question will be approached with specific examples and consideration of the possible outcomes.									3	0	0	0	1	0	3			1073-1199			WOS:000078470900001	10063434

The oxygen deficiency leads to a concomitant reduction of Sn4+ ions and the transport properties suggest low lattice polaron conduction with activation energy of 0.16 eV. Above 445 K, a plateau region is observed in the thermal variation of the conductivity caused by oxidation process, i.e. oxygen capture. The absence of the electrochemical peak Sn2+/4+ in the intensity-potential curve corroborates the delocalization of the stereo chemical pair Sn2+:5s(2). From photoelectrochemical measurements, the band gap is 2.80 eV and the transition is directly allowed. Moreover, indirect transition occurs at 2.60 eV. The material exhibits a long-term chemical stability over the whole pH range. In KOH (0.5 M) solution, the semi-logarithmic plot gave a current density of 24 mu A cm(-2) and a corrosion potential of -0.447 V-SCE. The capacitance measurements and cyclic voltammetry indicate that the photoresponse of BaSnO3-delta is characteristic of n-type conductivity with a flat band potential of -0.87 V-SCE and an electron density of 1.2 x 10(20) cm(-3). The best quantum efficiency occurs at 400 nm and is attributed to a depletion width (15 nm) and a diffusion length (57 nm) compared to a large penetration depth (820 nm). The electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) reveals the presence of bulk contribution effect and the Nyquist response has been decomposed on R-C parallel circuit. As application, BaSnO3-delta has been tested successfully for the hydrogen evolution under visible illumination when combined with the delafossite CuFeO2 as sensitizer. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

In normal chloroplasts, about 0.5 to 0.7 mol of Cyt b-559 was present in the HP form per 400 chlorophyll molecules. However, the HP form was converted to the LP form when the O-2-evolving center was inactivated by 0.8 M alkaline Tris-washing (pH 9.1). The inactivation was reversible and both the Cyt b-559 HP form and the O-2-evolving activity were restored by incubating the inactivated chloroplasts with weak light, Mn2+, Ca2+ and an electron donor (photoreactivation). The recovery of the HP form preceded the recovery of O-2-evolving activity, 3-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-1,1-dimethylurea (DCMU) and 2,5-dibromo-3-methyl-6-isopropyl-p-benzoquinone (DBMIB) did not inhibit the recovery of the HP form. Thus, the recovery of Cyt b-559 HP form was the primary reaction in the photoreactivation, which was stimulated by the light-induced redox reaction of the PS-II core center.									21	0	0	0	16	0	21			0166-8595			WOS:A1995TA03200008	24301381

If supported on graphene (G), the resulting 1-PPh3/G material can catalyze the HER in aqueous solutions over a wide pH range of 0-14 with a high efficiency and durability. The significantly enhanced activity of 1-PPh3/G, compared with that of its analogues 1-py/G (the Co-bound axial ligand is pyridine instead of triphenylphosphine) and 2-py/G (Co complex of 5,10,15-tris(pentafluorophenyl) corrole), highlights the effects of the pyrenyl substituent and the triphenylphosphine axial ligand on the HER activity. On one hand, the pyrenyl moiety can increase the p-p interactions between 1 and graphene and thus lead to a fast electron transfer from the electrode to 1. On the other hand, the triphenylphosphine axial ligand can increase the electron density (basicity) of Co and thus make the metal center more reactive to protons at the trans position through a so-called "push effect". This study concerns a significant example that shows the trans effect of the axial ligand on the HER, which has been investigated rarely.

Residual MIT in wastewater leads to high environmental risks and toxicity. The degradation of MIT via electrochemical oxidation, including kinetics, energy efficiency, oxidation mechanism and degradation pathway, was investigated in this study. Findings from energy and cost evaluation by using electrochemical technology were compared with those of other technologies. Experimental results indicate that electrolyte, current density and initial concentration can significantly affect MIT degradation. The lowest electrical energy per order was less than 3.85 kWh m(-3) when NaCl was used as the electrolyte. Electrochemical degradation is advantageous because it can be easily applied without adding chemicals into wastewater and has relative low costs. The oxygen evolution, production of recalcitrant byproducts, and the mass transfer limitation resulted in the decrease of instantaneous current efficiency and mineralization current efficiency. Electron efficiency analysis demonstrated that 68.8% of the electrons used for MIT oxidation were effectively utilized to mineralize MIT into CO2. The proportion of direct and indirect oxidation of MIT during electrochemical degradation was quantitatively determined as 37.7% and 62.3%, respectively. HO center dot was the most effective species for MIT degradation. MIT degradation pathway was proposed, in which the C=C bond in MIT was broken down. C3H7NOS and C3H7NO4 were detected, indicating the occurrence of ring opening reaction. Sulfur was oxidized into SO42- and cleaved from C3H7NOS.									73	0	0	0	31	0	73			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000477652900057		
J	Shen, Xiangjun; Hu, Jindou; Lu, Xiaoyan; Liu, Anjie; Lu, Zhenjiang; Xie, Jing; Cao, Yali								Interesting molecular adsorption strategy induced surface charge redistribution of commercial TiO2: Boosting 9 times photocatalytic hydrogen production performance								APPLIED SURFACE SCIENCE				596						153622	10.1016/j.apsusc.2022.153622				SEP 15 2022	2022	A higher conduction band position and more photogenerated electrons are distinctly important for the high-efficiency photocatalytic hydrogen evolution performance. However, raising conduction band position will enlarge the band gap and reduce the production of photogenerated electrons. Herein, a super simple and efficient ammonia molecular adsorption strategy was proposed and designed to promote efficient hydrogen production by a simple ammonia molecules adsorption on commercial TiO2 surface. The experimental and theoretical calculation results indicated that aniline can be successfully adsorbed on TiO2 surface by a straightforward mechanical grinding method, and the photocatalytic hydrogen production performance of TiO2 can be improved by more than 9 times after the adsorption of aniline. This is because the adsorbed aniline can provide electrons to the TiO2 surface and lead to a charge redistribution and accumulation on the surface of TiO2. Excessive electrons make the conduction band of TiO2 bend upward, thus improving the photogenerated electron reduction ability and the photocatalytic performance of TiO2. In addition, the adsorption of aniline enables TiO2 to show light absorption in the visible region, generating more photogenerated electrons to participate in the photocatalytic water splitting reaction. In this work, the molecular adsorption strategy is not only simple to operate, but also can improve the photoreduction ability and surface charge quantity of materials. It provides a simple and efficient new method for photocatalyst modification in addition to the traditional modification methods such as doping compounds.									1	0	0	0	1	0	1			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000830057000003

In this work, monolithic nanoporous (Mn,Ni)-doped Cu2S skeletons with controllable composition and tunable porosity are synthesized via dealloying and sulfuration technique. The as-prepared S-np-Mn70Cu29Ni1 electrode exhibits outstanding catalytic performance toward HER and OER in 1.0 M KOH solution, which drives high current density of 50 mA cm(-2) at the overpotentials of 136 and 317 mV respectively. The excellent catalytic performance is attributed to the unique three-dimensional interconnected bicontinuous nanoporous architecture, which not only exposes high-density catalytic active sites, but also accelerates electron/mass transfer between catalyst surface and electrolyte. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations also reveal that (Mn,Ni)-doped Cu2S matrix can accelerate water adsorption/dissociation and optimize adsorption desorption energetics of H intermediates, thus improving the intrinsic HER activity of nanoporous Cu2S electrocatalysts. Meanwhile, an alkaline water electrolyzer is constructed with the S-np-Mn70Cu29Ni1 electrode as anode and cathode respectively, depicting remarkable performance in water electrolysis. In the light of advantages such as adjustable composition and tunable porosity in alloying-dealloying process, it offers a new vision for tuning the porosity and catalytic activities of transition metal sulfides and other active catalysts.

A novel photocatalyst based on a metal-organic framework and spindle-shaped titanium dioxide nanoparticles was synthesized to perform photocatalytic water splitting reactions. The resulting composite (MIL-53@TiO2, MIL: Materiaux de l'Institut Lavoisier) was characterized by standard analytical methods. The photocatalytically active MIL-53@TiO2 composite produced hydrogen without using any sacrificial agents. The hydrogen production was observed to be 0.26 mmol in the presence of TiO2 which increased to 7.9 mmol in the presence of MIL-53@TiO2 composite after 180 min of irradiation. The corresponding hydrogen evolution rate was 26.33 mmol h(-1) g(-1), which was observed 30 times higher than the pristine materials. The remarkable photoactivity was due the superior charge separation property and less recombination of the charge carrier pair in the MIL-53@TiO2 composite. Furthermore, the photocatalyst exhibited excellent reusability for hydrogen production up to 4 cycles. The results shown in the present work may be extended for large-scale applications.

The uniform nanoarray morphology was formed in situ on the surface through natural oxygen uptake corrosion in air within 40 min. The Zr element induced rich lattice distortion and changed the electronic structure of the Ni(OH)(2) nanosheet surface. The electrons would accumulate around the interspace between Zr and neighboring O atoms, which increased the total density of states (DOS) near the Fermi level. Thus, the charge transfer was obviously accelerated, resulting in catalytic activity improvements. As a result, as-prepared Zr-Ni(OH)(2) nanosheets exhibited overpotentials of 263 mV at 500 mA/cm(2) and 274 mV at 1000 mA/cm(2) for the HER, as well as 310 mV at 500 mA/cm(2) and 328 mV at 1000 mA/cm(2) for the OER While serving as bifunctional water decomposition electrodes, current Zr-Ni(OH)(2) exhibited a cell voltage of 1.595 V at 10 mA/cm(2) and a relatively low voltage below 2 V at a large current density of 1000 mA/cm(2).									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2574-0962			WOS:000832794500045

In this work, a hybrid composed of reduced graphene oxide (RGO) nanosheets/Zn2+/Al3+ layered double hydroxide (RGO/ZnAl-LDH) composite films on the surface of 6N01 aluminum (Al) alloy was successfully synthesized by a novel and facile hydrothermal continuous flow method, which enabled direct growth of the composite on the surface of the Al alloy substrate. The structure and morphology of the RGO/ZnAl-LDH composite films were fully characterized. Based on electroehemical measurements in a NaCl solution, the RGO/ZnAI-LDH composite film significantly enhanced the corrosion protection, as compared with the ZnAl-LDH film. The RGO/ZnAl-LDH composite film could maintain an outstanding corrosion resistance after 7 days immersion in a high concentration of NaCI solution (i.e., 5.0 wt %). The, enhanced corrosion resistance was attributed to the barrier effect on diffusion of water, oxygen, and chloride ions by the RGO contained in the RGO/ZnAl-LDH composite films.									67	5	0	0	4	0	71			1944-8244			WOS:000402691600069	28445635

Mars experienced widespread volcanism in the past and volcanic emissions should have included reducing gases, such as H-2 and CO, as well as sulfur-bearing gases. Using a one-dimensional photochemical model, we consider whether plausible volcanic gas fluxes could have switched the redoxstate of the past martian atmosphere to reducing conditions. In our model, the total quantity and proportions of volcanic gases depend on the water content, outgassing pressure, and oxygen fugacity of the source melt. We find that, with reasonable melt parameters, the past martian atmosphere (similar to 3.5 Gyr to present) could have easily reached reducing and anoxic conditions with modest levels of volcanism, >0.14 km(3) yr(-1), which are well within the range of estimates from thermal evolution models or photogeological studies. Counter-intuitively we also find that more reducing melts with lower oxygen fugacity require greater amounts of volcanism to switch a paleo-atmosphere from oxidizing to reducing. The reason is that sulfur is more stable in such melts and lower absolute fluxes of sulfur-bearing gases more than compensate for increases in the proportions of H-2 and CO. These results imply that ancient Mars should have experienced periods with anoxic and reducing atmospheres even through the mid Amazonian whenever volcanic outgassing was sustained at sufficient levels. Reducing anoxic conditions are potentially conducive to the synthesis of prebiotic organic compounds, such as amino acids, and are therefore relevant to the possibility of life on Mars. Also, anoxic reducing conditions should have influenced the type of minerals that were formed on the surface or deposited from the atmosphere. We suggest looking for elemental polysulfur (S-8) as a signature of past reducing atmospheres. Finally, our models allow us to estimate the amount of volcanically sourced atmospheric sulfate deposited over Mars' history, approximately similar to 10(6)-10(9) Tmol, with a spread depending on assumed outgassing rate history and magmatic source conditions.

However, the serious photocorrosion limits its application in photocatalysis. Herein, a novel ternary graphene oxide (GO)-supported silver phosphate (APO)/cobalt ferrite (CFO) heterojunction composite was successfully synthesized via a simple ion-exchange deposition method for photocatalytic RhB degradation coupled with hydrogen generation from water-splitting under visible light irradiation. The results show that the photocatalytic degradation efficiency of the ternary APO-based composite is 2.37 times that of pure APO. Meanwhile, the photocatalytic H-2 evolution reaction (HER) of the ternary APO-based catalyst was realized for the first time. This enhanced performance could be attributed to the fact that the charge recombination can be effectively suppressed and the photocorrosion effect of APO can be inhibited as the photogenerated electrons on the conduction band of APO can be injected into CFO through the GO mediator. Furthermore, the possible photocatalytic mechanism of the ternary APO-based catalyst was proposed to illustrate its excellent photocatalytic activity and stability. The present work sheds light on the design of multifunctional photocatalysts to simultaneously solve the problems of energy crisis and environmental pollution.									9	0	0	0	1	0	9			2044-4753	2044-4761		WOS:000589508300019

Here, we have endowed NiMn-MOF@CoOOH with multiple strains, which were introduced by NiMn-MOF. In such hybrid material, the NiMn-MOF not only stabilizes the structure to prevent the material from breaking during the electro-oxidation phase change process but also serves as an anchor point to tightly connect Co ions. The surface of CoOOH undergoes lattice stretching and compression and builds abundant vacancies and dislocations. The multiple lattice strains enable accelerated ion conduction through tensile/compressive strain and introduce additional electrochemically active sites. Regional vacancies and dislocation can change the stoichiometric ratio of some regions, leading to local electric field distortion and electron density redistribution. Moreover, the stacked network structure of the double-layer sheet provides more electrochemical active interfaces for electrochemical reactions, which greatly reduces the ion transport distance and promotes the rapid diffusion of electrolyte ions. The as-obtained NiMn-MOF@CoOOH demonstrates a superb capacity of 1771.4 at 1 A g(-1) in supercapacitors. Meanwhile, when facing the water oxidation electrocatalysis reaction, it delivers low overpotentials of 221 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) in an alkaline electrolyte. This report provides a novel strategy for lattice strain engineering on advanced materials for sustainable applications. (C) 2022 Elsevier Inc.

Herein, a novel in-situ doping-induced lattice strain strategy of NiCoP/S nanocrystals (NCs) was proposed through using seed crystal conversion approach with NiCo2S4 spinel as precursor. The small amount of S atoms in NiCoP/S NCs perturbed the local electronic structure, leading to the atomic position shift of the nearest neighbor in the protocell and the nanoscale lattice strain, which optimized the H* adsorption free energy and activated H2O mole-cules, resulting the dramatically elevated HER performance within a wide pH range. Especially, the NiCoP/S NCs displayed better HER electrocatalytic activity than comical 20% Pt/C at high current density in 1 M KOH and natural seawater: it only needed 266 mV vs. reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) and 660 mV vs. RHE to arrive the current density of 350 mA cm(-2) in 1 M KOH and natural seawater, indicating the application prospect for industrial high current. Besides, NiCoP/S NCs also displayed excellent super-capacitor performance: it showed high specific capacity of 2229.9 F g(-1) at 1 A g(-1) and energy density of 87.49 Wh kg(-1), when assembled into an all-solid-state flexible device, exceeding performance of most transition metal phosphides. This work provides new insights into the regulation in electronic structure and lattice strain for electrocatalytic and energy storage applications.

And doping of atoms has been regarded as an efficient method to boost their electrocatalytic performance. Herein, we investigated the structural character-istics and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) performance of atoms-doped BP based on density functional theory (DFT) calculations. The results show that the doping of metal atoms can readjust the Bader charge distribution and density of state (DOS), improving their electronic properties. In addition, among the systems doped with eight kinds of elements (e.g. Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Ru, Rh, Pd, and Ag), the Fe-doped BP (Fe/BP) presents most nearly neutral hydrogen adsorption free energies (delta GH*, 0.034 eV), the highest charge exchange between Fe and P through the Fe-P bond, the highest charge exchange between H and Fe/BP model, and its d-band center is most nearly the Femi level as compared with the other systems. The results mentioned above can verify that the doping of metal atoms, especially the doping of Fe atoms can improve the HER performance obviously. This work can provide theoretical significance for the design of high-efficiency HER electrocatalyst.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000848607400001

Herein, a cooperative strategy is represented that enables 2D structure tailoring and lattice distortion engineering simultaneously over a BiVO4 photocatalyst for efficient visible-light-driven oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Specifically, the lattice distortion engineering is achieved through the introduction of a sodium (Na+) additive during the ion exchange process. Structural characterizations suggest the formation of ultrathin 2D monoclinic BiVO4 nanoflakes with shrank V-O and elongated Bi-O bonds. Mechanistic investigations reveal the advantages of ultrathin 2D features for exposing more (010) active facets and shortening the required migration distance for charge carriers to reach the catalytic surface. More importantly, the lattice distortion effect is found to crucially govern the charge carrier dynamics and catalytic surface behavior of BiVO4 photocatalyst, endowing the optimized sample with an outstanding photocatalytic OER performance triggering up to 69.4% apparent quantum efficiency over Fe3+ sacrificial solution. These findings highlight the functional application of morphology and dimensional modification, as well as lattice distortion engineering in synthesizing superior monoclinic BiVO4 photocatalyst for efficient visible-light-driven water oxidation.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1616-301X	1616-3028		WOS:000847978800001

Compared with the conventional planar Ti/SnO2-Sb/PbO2 electrode, the CF/PbO2 electrode displayed superior electrocatalytic performance for the degradation of phenol, with an 11.2 times higher rate constant. The improved performance was due to its larger active surface area, enrichment of phenol on the surface due to adsorption, and enhanced mass transfer with the porous 3D structure. It also exhibited an 11.4 times higher current efficiency and a 9.1 times lower energy consumption due to the superior electrocatalytic activity and a higher oxidation potential to hinder oxygen evolution. Moreover, the generation rate of center dot OH from CF/PbO2 was 1.3 times higher than that of the Ti/SnO2-Sb/PbO2 electrode. The surface chemistry on the CF/PbO2 electrode during phenol degradation was explored by in situ attenuated total reflection-Fourier transform infrared (ATR-FTIR) characterization, with aromatic intermediates and carboxylic acids identified as key reaction intermediates. This composite electrode also presented excellent long-term stability and durability and negligible leaching of Pb cation, demonstrating as a promising electrode for the electrocatalytic degradation of refractory pollution in wastewater treatment.									3	0	0	0	2	0	3			1932-7447	1932-7455		WOS:000742323400001

Therefore, a significant reduction of catalyst needs is crucial to reduce system costs and increase production ca-pacity. This study demonstrates the feasibility of a PEM water electrolysis cell design using porous transport electrodes (PTE) with catalyst coating by atomic layer deposition (ALD) and operation in 1 mol/L sulphuric acid at 60 degrees C. Though the catalyst loading has been reduced to 0.12 mg/cm(2) iridium on the anode and 0.28 mg/cm(2) platinum on the cathode, a current density of 168 mA/cm(2) and mean high mass activity of 1400 A/g iridium could be achieved at 1.7 V. The characterization of three high loading PTE cells is combined with a detailed overpotential analysis from polarization curve fits and demonstrates a repro-ducible cell setup. Further analysis steps show an increasing cell performance with increasing coating cycle numbers and the consistency of the anode performance in the three electrode setup with the complete cell. The ALD coated PTE design turns out to be a promising candidate for catalyst loading reduction in PEM electrolysis. (C) 2021 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Herein, novel 3D porous MoNi4 networks constructed by nanosheets show superior catalytic activity and durability towards overall water splitting, rivaling state-of-the-art non-noble bifunctional electrocatalysts. The porous MoNi4 networks were prepared on porous Ni foam by the hydrothermal process and then with the annealing process in hydrogen. The porous MoNi4 networks annealed at 450 degrees C show high activity for both HER and OER. The superior catalytic performance is ascribed to not only being fully reduced into MoNi4 but also maintaining the original morphology as much as possible after annealing at 450 degrees C. NiOOH species were formed on the surface of the porous MoNi4 networks annealed at 450 degrees C after OER, and the in situ formation of NiOOH leads to excellent activity as well as stability in the OER. The 3D porous MoNi4 networks annealed at 450 degrees C need only similar to 1.58 V to achieve 10 mA cm(-2) for overall water splitting and exhibit excellent stability without loss of activity after 24 hours. A two-electrode device to split water with porous MoNi4 networks as bifunctional electrocatalysts can be driven by a single AA battery (1.5 V).									95	3	0	0	6	0	95			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000395075600013

Among these regulatory signals, two pathways in particular, reactive oxygen species and reactive nitrogen species, have become of significant interest in several aspects of plant biology, underpinning these molecules as critical regulators during development, cellular differentiation, and plant-pathogen interaction. Recently, redox posttranslational modifications (PTM), such as S-nitrosylation on cysteine residues and tyrosine nitration, have shed light on multiple protein targets, as they are associated with signal networks/downstream metabolic pathways, capable of transducing the imbalance of redox hemostasis and consequently redirecting the biochemical status under stress conditions. However, most of the redox PTM have been studied only in the intracellular compartment, providing limited information concerning redox PTM in the extracellular matrix of plant cells. Nevertheless, recent studies have indicated the plausibility of redox PTM in extracellular proteins, including cell wall associated proteins. Accordingly, in this review, we endeavor to examine evidence of redox PTM supported by mass spectrometry data in the intracellular and extracellular space in plant cells. As a further example, we focus the last section of this review on illustrating, using molecular dynamics simulation, the effect of S-nitrosylation on the structural conformation of well-known cell wall-associated proteins including pectin methylesterase and xyloglucan endo-transglycosylases.									11	0	0	0	11	0	11			0952-3499	1099-1352		WOS:000453230300002	30033658

A prerequisite of metal hyperaccumulation is metal hypertolerance. Genetic analysis of a backcross population derived from Arabidopsis lyrata x A. halleri crosses revealed three quantitative trait loci for Cd hypertolerance. A candidate gene for Cdtol2 is AhCAX1, encoding a vacuolar Ca2+/H+ antiporter. We developed a method for the transformation of vegetatively propagated A. halleri plants and generated AhCAX1-silenced lines. Upon Cd2+ exposure, several-fold higher accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) was detectable in roots of AhCAX1-silenced plants. In accordance with the dependence of Cdtol2 on external Ca2+ concentration, this phenotype was exclusively observed in low Ca2+ conditions. The effects of external Ca2+ on Cd accumulation cannot explain the phenotype as they were not influenced by the genotype. Our data strongly support the hypothesis that higher expression of CAX1 in A. halleri relative to other Arabidopsis species represents a Cd hypertolerance factor. We propose a function of AhCAX1 in preventing a positive feedback loop of Cd-elicited ROS production triggering further Ca2+-dependent ROS accumulation.									27	1	0	0	21	0	28			0140-7791	1365-3040		WOS:000445199900017	29879753

Recently, it has been demonstrated to also show very high proficiency for phosphate ester hydrolysis. Such proficient catalytic promiscuity is significant, as promiscuity has been suggested to play an important role in enzyme evolution. Additionally, a comparative study of the hydrolyses of the p-nitrophenyl phosphate and sulfate monoesters in aqueous solution has demonstrated that despite superficial similarities, the two reactions proceed through markedly different transition states with very different solvation effects, indicating that the requirements for the efficient catalysis of the two reactions by an enzyme will also be very different (and yet they are both catalyzed by the same active site). This work explores the promiscuous phosphomonoesterase activity of PAS. Specifically, we have investigated the identity of the most likely base for the initial activation of the unusual formylglycine hydrate nucleophile (which is common to many sulfatases), and demonstrate that a concerted substrate-as-base mechanism is fully consistent with the experimentally observed data. This is very similar to other related systems, and suggests that, as far as the phosphomonoesterase activity of PAS is concerned, the sulfatase behaves like a classical phosphatase, despite the fact that such a mechanism is unlikely to be available to the native substrate (based on pKa considerations and studies of model systems). Understanding such catalytic versatility can be used to design novel artificial enzymes that are far more proficient than the current generation of designer enzymes.

OI is defined as the mole fraction of oxygen in the oxidizer. Sixteen flames are studied with OI ranging from 21% (air) to 76.3%, so that OI varies in small increments and its effects are precisely resolved. The soot volume fraction distribution is measured experimentally for all flames using color-ratio pyrometry. Simulations are carried out using an extensively validated chemical kinetic mechanism and an aggregate-based soot model that accounts for all major processes of soot inception, growth, and oxidation. The experimental measurements show that the visible flame height decreases with increasing OI, which is consistent with theoretical estimates and the numerical simulations. The measurements also indicate that increasing OI (from 21% to 36.8%) first results in an increase in the maximum soot concentration, but a further increase in OI leads to a decrease in the soot yield. Additionally, the maximum soot concentration occurs on the flame centerline for low OI flames (below 36.8%), but for higher OI, the peak soot yield occurs in the flame wings. All of these experimental observations are well reproduced by the simulations, with the maximum soot volume fraction magnitudes lying within the error bounds of the experimental measurements. The computational results are used to reveal the underlying physical mechanisms, by examining soot evolution along characteristic Lagrangian trajectories through flame regions. We find that increasing OI leads to higher flame temperature, which results in a stronger soot production rate, but also reduced soot residence time in flame regions, which allows less time for soot production. These competing effects cause the initial increase and subsequent decrease in the maximum soot yield and the shift in the maximum soot yield location with increasing OI.

J	Askerka, Mikhail; Brudvig, Gary W.; Batista, Victor S.								The O-2-Evolving Complex of Photosystem II: Recent Insights from Quantum Mechanics/Molecular Mechanics (QM/MM), Extended X-ray Absorption Fine Structure (EXAFS), and Femtosecond X-ray Crystallography Data								ACCOUNTS OF CHEMICAL RESEARCH				50	1			41	48		10.1021/acs.accounts.6b00405				JAN 2017	2017	Efficient photoelectrochemical water oxidation may open a way to produce energy from renewable solar power. In biology, generation of fuel due to water oxidation happens efficiently on an immense scale during the light reactions of photosynthesis. To oxidize water, photosynthetic organisms have evolved a highly conserved protein complex, Photosystem II. Within that complex, water oxidation happens at the CaMn4O5 inorganic catalytic cluster, the so-called oxygen-evolving complex (OEC), which cycles through storage "S" states as it accumulates oxidizing equivalents and produces molecular oxygen. In recent years, there has been significant progress in understanding the OEC as it evolves through the catalytic cycle. Studies have combined conventional and femtosecond X-ray crystallography with extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) and quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/ MM) methods and have addressed changes in protonation states of y-oxo bridges and the coordination of substrate water through the analysis of ammonia binding as a chemical analog of water. These advances are thought to be critical to understanding the catalytic cycle since protonation states regulate the relative stability of different redox states and the geometry of the OEC. Therefore, establishing the mechanism for substrate water binding and the nature of protonation/redox state transitions in the OEC is essential for understanding the catalytic cycle of 02 evolution.The structure of the dark-stable S, state has been a target for X-ray crystallography for the past 15 years. However, traditional Xray crystallography has been hampered by radiation-induced reduction of the OEC. Very recently, a revolutionary X-ray free electron laser (XFEL) technique was applied to PSII to reveal atomic positions at 1.95 A without radiation damage, which brought us closer than ever to establishing the ultimate structure of the OEC in the S, state. However, the atom positions in this crystal structure are still not consistent with high-resolution EXAFS spectroscopy, partially due to the poorly resolved oxygen positions next to Mn centers and partial reduction due to extended dark adaptation of the sample. These inconsistencies led to the new models of the OEC with an alternative low oxidation state and raised questions on the protonation state of the cluster, especially the O-5,u-oxo bridge. This Account summarizes the most recent models of the OEC that emerged from QM/MM, EXAFS and femtosecond X-ray crystallography methods.When PSII in the S, state is exposed to light, the S, state is advanced to the higher oxidation states and eventually binds substrate water molecules. Identifying the substrate waters is of paramount importance for establishing the water-oxidation mechanism but is complicated by a large number of spectroscopically similar waters. Water analogues can, therefore, be helpful because they serve as spectroscopic markers that help to track the motion of the substrate waters. Due to a close structural and electronic similarity to water, ammonia has been of particular interest. We review three competing hypotheses on substrate water/ammonia binding and compile theoretical and experimental evidence to support them. Binding of ammonia as a sixth ligand to Mn4 during the S1 > S2 transition seems to satisfy most of the criteria, especially the most compelling recent EPR data on D I-D61A mutated PSII. Such a binding mode suggests delivery of water from the "narrow" channel through a "carousel" rearrangement of waters around Mn4 upon the S2 > S3 transition. An alternative hypothesis suggests water delivery through the "large" channel on the Ca side. However, both water delivery paths lead to a similar S3 structure, seemingly reaching consensus on the nature of the last detectable S-state intermediate in the Kok cycle before 02 evolution.									137	2	0	0	36	0	137			0001-4842	1520-4898		WOS:000392457800006	28001034

In this study, N was doped into carbonaceous material within S to evaluate the peroxymonosulfate (PMS) activation performance of the obtained carbocatalyst for the degradation of acetaminophen (ACE). The results demonstrated that individually N or S doped carbocatalysts could activate PMS, but only N doping exhibit significant PMS activation performance. More interestingly, simultaneously co-existed of N and S exhibited obviously lower PMS activation performance than individual N doping. Density functional theory (DFT) calculation exhibited that N doped carbon matrix possessed more positive surface electrostatic potential than N and S co-doped carbocatalyst, amongst S exhibited opposite electronic structure regulation compared with N. Therefore, the PMS activation performance of N doped carbon was significantly higher than that by N and S co-existed carbon. SO4 center dot-, HO center dot,1O2 and O2 center dot- was involved in the reaction, the result shown that singlet oxygen amplified the non-radical mechanism and the electron transfer from adsorbed organic pollutant to adsorbed PMS was the another dominated pathway to the ACE degradation. Further experiments unraveled that higher PMS concentration, catalysts dosage, and lower initial solution pH would facilitate the PMS activation process.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2213-2929	2213-3437		WOS:000806530500003

However, as the key component, membrane electrodeassembly (MEA) in PEMWEs is still facing challenges due to its costand durability. Optimization attempts through conventional trial-and-error methods are inefficient due to the complex design parameters thatspan different scales. To avoid expensive investments in experimentsand time, machine learning (ML) is introduced to achieve reliableprediction of MEA performance (current density@1.5 similar to 2.0 V; 0.1 V asthe interval) and durability (average decay rate) via data-driven models.For instance, the as-trained gradient boost regression model couldpredict the current density@1.9 V with anR2of 0.943 on the test set. Moreover, different black-box interpretation methods wereinnovatively applied to directly illustrate the insights from ML models into important parameters, and consensus could be reachedwith previous studies as a proof of data-driven models'reliability. In addition to providing novel guidance in designing MEAs, theproposed ML workflow could be considered a new research paradigm and extended to other energy-related fields									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2168-0485			WOS:000791025300022

Transition metal oxides (TMOs) and chalcogenides (TMCs) comprise one of the most popular categories of photocatalysts, thanks to their high stability, low cost, Earth abundance, and outstanding catalytic activity. Downsizing TMOs and TMCs to 2D materials offers additional opportunities to finely tune their surface, electronic, and catalytic properties. However, 2D TMOs and TMCs fall into a less mature field than other well-established 2D materials. Less is known about their "form-to-function" relationship, and mechanisms for their synthesis await more research. Herein, the progress toward the rational design of layered and nonlayered 2D TMOs and TMCs is summarized, as well as principles to engineer their nanosheets (NSs) into 3D architectures for practical application. The formation mechanisms and crystal growth models of these 2D materials are included. The key factors that determine the electronic, surface structures, and catalytic properties of 2D TMOs and TMCs are examined in particular, which are key considerations in tuning their performance in light absorption, charge carrier transfer/separation, molecule capture and activation, etc. Finally, the present challenges and future research directions in this promising field are illustrated.									16	1	0	0	0	0	15			2367-198X			WOS:000595434900001

The introduced supramolecular polymers melamine cyanurate (MC) acts a barrier to prevent the graphene sheets from restacking, and meanwhile functions as a soft template to create porous structure as well as nitrogen source for in-situ N-doping. The transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images show that the P-NrGO exhibits wrinkled and loose-packed thin layer structure with a large number of pores. X-ray photoelectron spectrometer (XPS) spectra demonstrate that pyridine and pyrrole-N was the main nitrogen bonding states, which were favorable for the improvements of supercapacitive performance. Attributed to the synergistic effects of the porous structure and the N-doping, the P-NrGO1 exhibits an increase of 56.5% in the specific capacitance (335 F g(-1)) when compared with the rGO (214 F g(-1)). In addition, the capacitance retention ratio reaches 94.3% after 10000 cycles, indicating the excellent electrochemical stability.

In this work, it has been demonstrated that the reversible Cr3+/Cr6+ redox reaction can only be realized in a wide voltage range between 1.0 and 4.8 V. This is mainly due to large polarization during the discharge. The reversible migration of the Cr ions between octahedral and tetrahedral sites leads to large extent of cation mixing between lithium and transition metal layers, which does not affect the lithium storage capacity and stabilize the structure. In addition, a distorted spinel phase (Li3M2O4) is identified in the deeply discharged sample (1.0 V, Li1.5Cr0.4Mn0.4O2) The above results can explain the high reversible capacity and high structural stability achieved on Li1.2Cr0.4Mn0.4O2. These new findings will provide further in depth understanding on multielectron transfer and local structure stabilization mechanisms in intercalation chemistry, which are essential for understanding and developing a high capacity intercalation-type cathode for next generation high energy density Li-ion batteries.									50	10	0	0	2	0	53			0897-4756	1520-5002		WOS:000359499100012

In this paper, we report a detailed study of the effects of 2,4,6-trinitrophenol (TNP) and other phenolic inhibitors, bromoxynil and dinoseb, on PS II energetics. In intact PS II, phenolic inhibitors bound to only 90-95% of Q(B) sites even at saturating concentrations. The remaining PS II reaction centers (5-10%) showed modified Q(A) to Q(B) electron transfer but were sensitive to urea/triazine inhibitors. The binding of phenolic inhibitors was 30- to 300-fold slower than the urea/triazine class of Q(B) site inhibitors, DCMU and atrazine. In the sensitive centers, the S(2)Q(A-) state was 10-fold less stable in the presence of phenolic inhibitors than the urea/triazine herbicides. In addition, the binding affinity of phenolic herbicides was decreased 10-fold in the S(2)Q(A)(-) state than the S(1)Q(A) state. However, removal of the oxygen-evolving complex (OEC) and associated extrinsic polypeptides by hydroxylamine (HA) washing abolished the slow binding kinetics as well as the destabilizing effects on the charge-separated state. The S-2-multiline electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) signal and the 'split' EPR signal, originating from the S2YZ state showed no significant changes upon binding of phenolic inhibitors at the Q(B) site. We thus propose a working model where Q(A) redox potential is lowered by short-range conformational changes induced by phenolic inhibitor binding at the Q(B) niche. Long-range effects of HA-washing eliminate this interaction, possibly by allowing more flexibility in the Q(B) site. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science B.V.

Herein, we developed an in-situ phosphating Co@nitrogen-doping graphene to obtain N and P co-doped carbon-coated cobalt phosphide (CoP@N,P-C) that could be used for overall water splitting. The unique 3D porous structure of CoP@N,P-C is characterized by a large number of active catalytic sites. High wettability of catalyst in electrolyte solution facilitates the transfer of ions. The synergism between the CoP cores and N, P-C shells improves the total hydrolysis performance of the electrocatalyst during the HER and OER. M the current densities of 10 mA/cm(2) (1 M of KOH), the HER overpotential recorded for the CoP@N,P-C is 113 mV, and the OER overpotential is 320 mV. The cell voltage of the CoP@N, P-C as bifunctional electrode for overall water splitting is 1.67 V (at 10 mA/cm(2)), which is close to that of the full noble-metal electrode (RuO2 parallel to PVC, 1.58 V).

The high dielectric loss associated with CCTO-based ceramics limits applications and drives the development of new solutions (e.g., ceramic composites). The incorporation of the Sn4+ ions in the CCTO structure predicted using atomistic simulations was confirmed experimentally by the Rietveld analysis and scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and its influence on the dielectric and nonohmic response was evaluated using impedance spectroscopy and current-voltage measurements. The results show that the doubly-ionized oxygen vacancies (V-O(center dot center dot)) generate enhanced grain boundary response, optimizing the dielectric permittivity at 1 kHz for samples with x = 2% (epsilon similar to 1.42 x 10(5)). On the other hand, the nonlinear coefficient was enhanced on the sample with x = 1% (alpha similar to 7.0) with low leakage current (0.534 mA) and improved breakdown electric field (E-b similar to 1.274 kV/cm). Thus, our work demonstrates the possibility to tune the dielectric, and nonohmic response using CCTO/CTO/SnO2 composites based on the internal barrier layer capacitor effect.									19	1	0	0	0	0	19			1044-5803	1873-4189		WOS:000598509400001

The strong impact of graphene amount on the electrochemical performance of Ni-Co layered double hydroxides is illustrated. Controlling the mass of graphene (15 mg) leads to a maximum specific capacitance of 1265 F g(-1) high rate capability (50% capacitance retention after increasing current density ten times), and good cycling life (92.9% capacitance retention after 2000 circles). The combination of battery-type Ni-Co LDH hollow nanocages/graphene composite and active carbon allows for the excellent electrochemical performance measured in an asymmetric device. In detail, the assembled asymmetric supercapacitor is able to deliver maximum specific capacitance 170.9 F g(-1) in a potential window of 0-1.7 V, high energy density (68.0 Wh kg(-1)), as well as excellent power output (4759 W kg(-1)). These electrochemical performances, in combination with its facile fabrication, render hollow Ni-Co LDH/graphene composite as a promising electrode material in a sustainable energy storage device.									68	2	0	0	3	0	69			2168-0485			WOS:000414825900047		
J	Marigo, P; Bressan, A; Chiosi, C								TP-AGB stars with envelope burning								ASTRONOMY & ASTROPHYSICS				331	2			564	580						MAR 10 1998	1998	In this paper we focus on the TP-AGB evolution of intermediate-mass stars experiencing envelope burning (M = 4 divided by 5 M.). Our model of the TP-AGB phase is suitably designed to follow the peculiar behaviour of these stars, to which the simple analytical treatment valid in the low-mass range can no longer be applied.The approach we have adopted is a semi-analytical one as it combines analytical relationships derived from complete models of TP-AGB stars with sole envelope models in which the physical structure is calculated from the photosphere down to the core. The solution for the envelope models stands on an original numerical method which allows to treat major aspects of envelope burning.The method secures that, during the quiescent inter-pulse periods, fundamental quantities such as the effective temperature, the surface luminosity, the physical structure of the deepest and hottest layers of the envelope, and the related energy generation from nuclear burning, are not input parameters but the consequence of envelope model calculations. This minimizes the use of analytical relations, thus giving our results greater homogeneity and accuracy.Moreover, we would like to draw the attention on the general validity of our algorithm which can be applied also to the case of low-mass stars, in which envelope burning does not occur.Our efforts are directed to analyse the effects produced by envelope burning, such as: i) the energy contribution which may drive significant deviations from the standard core mass-luminosity relationship; and ii) the changes in the surface chemical composition due to nuclear burning via the CNO cycle.Evolutionary models for stars with initial mass of 4.0, 4.5, 5.0 M. and two choices of the initial chemical composition ([Y = 0.28, Z = 0.02] and [Y = 0.25, Z = 0.008]) are calculated from the first thermal pulse till the complete ejection of the envelope. We find that massive TP-AGB stars can rapidly reach high luminosities (-6 > M-bol > -7), without exceeding, however, the classical limit to the AGE luminosity of M-bol similar or equal to -7.1 corresponding to the Chandrasekhar value of the core mass. No carbon stars brighter than M-bol similar to -6.5 are predicted to form (the alternative of a possible transition from M-star to C-star during the final pulses is also explored), in agreement with observations which indicate that most of the very luminous AGE stars are oxygen-rich.Finally, new chemical yields from stars in the mass range 4 divided by 5 M. are presented, so as to extend the sets of stellar yields from low-mass stars already calculated by Marigo et al. (1996). For each CNO element we give both the secondary and the primary components.									115	2	0	0	0	4	116			0004-6361			WOS:000072518700025

Studies of these subfamilies indicated that they show considerable evolutionary selection. We performed a comparative genomic analysis that identified 50 ferric reduction oxidases (FRO) and 77 NOX gene homologs from 20 species representing the eight major plant lineages within the supergroup Plantae: glaucophytes, rhodophytes, chlorophytes, bryophytes, lycophytes, gymnosperms, monocots, and eudicots. Phylogenetic and structural analysis classified these FRO and NOX genes into four well-conserved groups represented as NOX, FRO I, FRO II, and FRO III. Further analysis of NOXs of phylogenetic and exon/intron structures showed that single intron loss and gain had occurred, yielding the diversified gene structures during the evolution of NOXs family genes and which were classified into four conserved subfamilies which are represented as Sub. I, Sub. II, Sub. III, and Sub.IV. Additionally, both available global microarray data analysis and quantitative real-time PCR experiments revealed that the NOX genes in Arabidopsis and rice (Oryza sativa) have different expression patterns in different developmental stages, various abiotic stresses and hormone treatments. Finally, coexpression network analysis of NOX genes in Arabidopsis and rice revealed that NOXs have significantly correlated expression profiles with genes which are involved in plants metabolic and resistance progresses. All these results suggest that NOX family underscores the functional diversity and divergence in plants. This finding will facilitate further studies of the NOX family and provide valuable information for functional validation of this family in plants.									28	1	0	0	20	0	29			1759-6653			WOS:000373839200027	26907500

Advanced materials (Deerfield Beach, Fla.)								e2207041	e2207041		10.1002/adma.202207041				2022-Oct-25	2022	Water electrolysis is a promising technique for carbon neutral hydrogen production. A great challenge remains at developing robust and low-cost anode catalysts. Many pre-catalysts have been found to undergo surface reconstruction to give high intrinsic activity in oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The reconstructed oxyhydroxides on the surface are active species and most of them outperform directly synthesized oxyhydroxides. The reason for the high intrinsic activity remains to be explored. Here, we report a study to showcase the unique reconstruction behaviors of a pre-catalyst, thiospinel CoFe2 S4 , and its reconstruction chemistry for a high OER activity. The reconstruction of CoFe2 S4 gives a mixture with both Fe-S component and active oxyhydroxide (Co(Fe)Ox Hy ) because Co is more inclined to reconstruct as oxyhydroxide, while the Fe is more stable in Fe-S component in a major form of Fe3 S4 . The interface spin channel is demonstrated in the reconstructed CoFe2 S4, which optimizes the energetics of OER steps on Co(Fe)Ox Hy species and facilitates the spin sensitive electron transfer to reduce the kinetic barrier of O-O coupling. The advantage is also demonstrated in a membrane electrode assembly (MEA) electrolyzer. This work introduces the feasibility of engineering the reconstruction chemistry of the pre-catalyst for high performance and durable MEA electrolyzers. This article is protected by copyright.

Moreover, sodium tungstate dihydrate (Na2WO4 center dot 2H(2)O) instead of tungsten hexachloride (WCl6) further lowers cost and facilitates preparation. P25/blue WO3-x heterostructure, rich in oxygen vacancies with typical blue color, exhibits improved performances in both electrocatalysis and photocatalysis. Compared with the pure P25 and blue WO3-x, the exchange current density of P25/blue WO3-x was increased by 6 times and 22 times, respectively. P25/blue WO3-x showed the lowest over potential and relatively small Tafel slope. Also, the degradation efficiency of P25/blue WO3-x was much higher than other samples. The mechanism of photocatalysis was investigated. The trapping experiments confirmed h(+) and center dot OH were the main active species in photocatalytic reaction. The matched energy levels and built-in electric field of heterostructure interface can inhibit the recombination of photogenerated electron-hole pairs to enhance the photodegrading efficiency. The simple low-cost method is a beneficial attempt to prepare excellent bi-functional materials with electrocatalytic and photocatalytic properties for practical application prospect in energy shortage and environmental pollution.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2365-6549			WOS:000834120800001

Oxyphototrophs have evolved diverse antenna systems, enabling them to adapt to different habitats. Recently, high-resolution structures of PSII-antenna supercomplexes from the green lineage (higher plants and green algae) and the red lineage (diatoms) were solved. The antenna complexes from the two lineages share similar protein folding, but differ in terms of the oligomeric states, pigment composition, and assembly patterns with the core. These differences result in distinct pigment-protein networks in PSII from different organisms. We herein summarize the similarities and differences in these structures and outline the molecular basis of the assembly, energy transfer, and regulation of the eukaryotic PSII-antenna supercomplexes.									2	0	0	0	1	0	2			0959-440X	1879-033X		WOS:000565166700009	32389895

The tunable morphologies of Co3O4 nanostructures such as porous nanocubes (PNCs), nanooctahedra (NOHs), and nanosticks (NSKs) are synthesized, and characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns, nitrogen adsorption/desorption isotherms (BET), and electrochemical impedance spectral (EIS) methods. The HBV probe DNA (ssDNA) is immobilized on the Co3O4 nanostructures through coordinate bond formation between nucleic acid of ssDNA and Co metal, which results in highly stable nanostructured biosensing platform. To the best of our knowledge, first time the target cDNA of HBV is detected using ssDNA/Co3O4PNCs/GCE electrode by EIS method with a limit of detection (LOD) of 0.38 pM (signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) = 3). Moreover, the ssDNA/Co3O4PNCs/GCE has shown excellent specificity to HBV target cDNA, compared with noncomplementary DNA, and 1- and 3-mismatch DNAs. Finally, we explore ssDNA/Co3O4PNCs/GCE as potential electrode to test HBV DNA in blood serum and urine samples for practical applications.									26	1	0	0	8	0	27			0003-2700	1520-6882		WOS:000467642100051	30917656

The prepared nanocatalyst was characterized by powder X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and electrochemical methods. The XRD and XPS analysis show that the prepared MMOH is mixed valance (Mn3+/Mn4+), and the microscopic results confirm the Pd nanoparticles uniformly coated on the MMOH. The cyclic voltammetric studies reveal that the MMOH/Pd catalyst-modified electrode exhibited improved electrocatalytic activity for Xylitol electrooxidation compared to C/Pd. The intermediates formed during the electro-oxidation reactions were removed by increasing the forward scanning potential from +0.2 V to +0.8 V. The catalytic involvement of MMOH nanorods in poison management is discussed in detail. This study demonstrates the MMOH acts as a superior catalytic supporting material for noble metal catalyst towards polyalcohol electro-oxidation.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1533-4880	1533-4899		WOS:000404914400027

However, their cost restricts their use in large-scale operations. To improve their utilization, identifying a synthesis method of nano-structured iridiumoxidewith a high active surface area, possibly in a supported form, is of great importance. For this aim, we developed a one-step and cost-effective solution combustion synthesis (SCS) method to prepare nano-structured IrO2 and IrO2-based materials suitable for PEM electrolysis. Among various materials prepared, the iridium oxide incorporated and dispersed in amorphous alumina showed a high surface area (131 m(2) g(-1)) and the current density of 1.78 A cm(-2) at 1.8 V which is comparable to the performance of the state-of-the-art commercial membrane electrode assembly (MEA) made of IrRuOx (1.8 A cm(-2) at 1.8 V) under PEM water electrolysis. Importantly, the dispersion of the material in the catalyst ink used for the preparation of the MEA was significantly superior compared to that of commercial IrO2 nanoparticles and the amount of the preciousmetal in the catalystmade by SCS could be reduced by 45 wt% compared to that in the commercial MEA.									34	1	0	0	0	0	34			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000396146900002

The role of fluids in faulting deformation in the selected fault segment is remarkably different from observations at other major fault zones. Our data suggest reduced. fluid rock interactions in both areas and limited fluid flow. The fault did not act as an important fluid conduit. There are no indications that hydrothermal reactions ( cementation, dissolution) did change the strength and behavior of the fault zone, although the two areas show considerable differences with respect to fluid sources and fluid flow. In one area, the investigated calcite mineralization reveals an open fluid system with. fluids originating from a variety of sources. Stable isotopes (delta C-13, delta O-18), strontium isotopes, and trace elements indicate both infiltration of descending ( meteoric and/ or sea water) and ascending hydrothermal fluids. In the other area, all geochemical data indicate only local ( small scale) fluid redistribution. These fluids were derived from the adjacent limestones under nearly closed-system conditions.									14	1	0	0	0	0	15			1437-3254	1437-3262		WOS:000228539200007

Argon and nitrogen partial pressures were kept constant at P-Ar = 0.4 Pa and P-N2 = 0.1 Pa, respectively, whereas that of water vapour was systematically changed from P-H2O = 0 to 0.1 Pa. The crystallographic structure was analysed by Xray diffraction and showed that an increase of the water vapour partial pressure favoured an amorphous structure of the films. The morphology observed by scanning electron microscopy exhibited a typical columnar microstructure for any water vapour partial pressure. The chemical composition of TiOxNy thin films was measured by Rutherford backscattering spectroscopy and nuclear reaction analysis. They revealed a reverse evolution of oxygen and nitrogen concentrations (from x = 2 to 0 and inversely, from y = 0 to 1) with a significant amount of hydrogen (more than 10 at. %) for water vapour partial pressures higher than 6.0x10(-2) Pa. Optical properties and electrical conductivity were also performed. A gradual shift from metallic to semiconducting behaviours was observed with an increasing supply of the water vapour partial pressure. Electrochromic performances were finally measured and discussed taking into account the influence of the water vapour partial pressure injected into the sputtering process on the structure, chemical composition, optical and electrical properties of the films.

The supported La0.8Sr0.2MnO3+x catalysts were prepared by impregnation of the supports with an adequate amount of an aqueous solution of the corresponding metal nitrates resulting in a loading of 20 wt% La0.8Sr((0).2)MnO3+x. The mean crystallite size as estimated by XRD line broadening was larger for the perovskite supported on LaAl11O18 than on LaAlO3. La0.8Sr0.2MnO3+x on both differently prepared LaAlO3 supports was much more stable towards thermal decomposition than on LaAl11O18, as confirmed by oxygen evolution and thermal analysis. Kinetic studies of methane combustion were carried out in a fixed-bed microreactor in the range 600 - 1220 K and at atmospheric pressure using a reactant mixture with a ratio CH4:O-2 = 1:4. For the LaAlO3-supported catalysts the reaction rates, referred to the weight of La0.8Sr0.2MnO3+x, were about three times higher at 770 than corresponding rates of the unsupported La0.8Sr0.2MnO3+x. In contrast, the LaAl11O18-supported catalysts showed similar activities as unsupported La0.8Sr0.2MnO3+x.					6th International Symposium on Preparation of Catalysts - Scientific Bases for the Preparation of Heterogeneous Catalysts6th International Symposium on Preparation of Catalysts - Scientific Bases for the Preparation of Heterogeneous Catalysts	SEP 05-08, 1994SEP 05-08, 1994	Akzo Chem B V, Netherlands; Bayer AG, Germany; Catalysts & Chem Europe, Belgium; Degussa AG, Germany; Dow Benelux N V, Netherlands; DSM Res B V, Netherlands; Eka Nobel, Sweden; Engelhard DeMeern, Netherlands; Grace GmbH, Germany; Haldor Topsoe, Denmark; Hoechst AG, Germany; Johnson Matthey, Catalysts Syst Div, England; Montecatini Technol SRL, Italy; Norsk Hydro, Norway; Procatalyse, France; Repsol Petroleo, Spain; Solvay S A, Belgium; Sud Chem AG, Germany; Unicat S A, BelgiumAkzo Chem B V, Netherlands; Bayer AG, Germany; Catalysts & Chem Europe, Belgium; Degussa AG, Germany; Dow Benelux N V, Netherlands; DSM Res B V, Netherlands; Eka Nobel, Sweden; Engelhard DeMeern, Netherlands; Grace GmbH, Germany; Haldor Topsoe, Denmark; Hoechst AG, Germany; Johnson Matthey, Catalysts Syst Div, England; Montecatini Technol SRL, Italy; Norsk Hydro, Norway; Procatalyse, France; Repsol Petroleo, Spain; Solvay S A, Belgium; Sud Chem AG, Germany; Unicat S A, Belgium	LOUVAIN, BELGIUMLOUVAIN, BELGIUM	5	0	0	0	0	0	5					0-444-82078-7	WOS:A1995BE35H00060

We report IMPs nanoparticles' fabrication with different metal element compositions anchored on phosphorus-doped vertically aligned graphene arrays (IMPs/P-VG), which is successfully achieved by tuning the different phosphates in the electroless plating solution. Compared with other metal ratios of electrocatalysts, Fe0.5Co1.5Ni0.5P/P-VG exhibits the best apparent and intrinsic activity in 1 M KOH, and it also shows good stability up to 12 h without any significant degradation. Moreover, benefiting the unique hierarchical vertical arrays nanostructure of the substrate and the trimetallic phosphides' synergetic effects, the Faraday efficiency of the electrolytic cell based on Fe0.5Co1.5Ni0.5P/P-VG double electrode for the overall water-splitting is up to 90%. This study suggests that proper tuning of the composition of metal elements in IMPs and integrated on compatible substrates can effectively improve the electrocatalytic activity of IMPs for water splitting.

Both facilities allow measurements to be made at temperatures of 900-2000 K, at pressures of 0.38-2.23 MPa, and at equivalence ratios of 0.5, 1.0, and 2.0. In ST experiments, nitrogen served as a diluent gas, whereas in RCM runs the diluent gas composition ranged from pure nitrogen to pure argon. Recording pressure, UV, and visible emissions identified the evolution of chemical reactions. Correlations of ignition delay time were generated from the data for each facility. At temperatures below 1300 K, a significant reduction of average activation energy from 53 to 15.3 kcal/mol was obtained. Moreover, the RCM data showed significant scatter that dramatically increased with decreasing temperature. An explanation for the abnormal scatter in the data was proposed based on the high-speed visualization of auto-ignition phenomena and experiments performed with oxygen-free and fuel-free mixtures. It is proposed that the main reason for such a significant reduction of average activation energy is attributable to the premature ignition of ultrafine particles in the reactive mixture.					25th International Colloquium on the Dynamics of Explosions and Reactive Systems (ICDERS)25th International Colloquium on the Dynamics of Explosions and Reactive Systems (ICDERS)	AUG 02-07, 2015AUG 02-07, 2015		Leeds, ENGLANDLeeds, ENGLAND	13	2	1	0	0	0	15			0938-1287	1432-2153		WOS:000382406400012

The results showed that titanium exhibited spontaneous passivation behavior in solutions with 0 M and 0.0005 M fluoride ions, compared with the active-passive behavior with 0.002 M similar to 0.005 M. A critical value of the fluoride concentration was defined between 0.0005 M and 0.002 M. Multiple corrosion potentials were found under the conditions with fluoride ions higher than 0.002 M. The fluoride ion accelerated the corrosion of titanium via changing the structure of the film formed at OCP and destroying the protectiveness of the film, while it had few effects on cathodic hydrogen evolution reaction and passivation process at OCP. A corrosion mechanism associated with the fluoride ion was proposed. The corrosion behavior was well interpreted using the proposed mechanism and a criteria for the critical value of the fluoride concentration was also proposed. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Good stability of current collectors toward high operation voltage closely determines whether the voltage window of aqueous supercapacitors can be further improved. Here, the electrochemical stability of representative current collectors in aqueous electrolytes in terms of intrinsic response toward oxygen/hydrogen evolution side reaction and capacitance contribution are decoupled detailedly. The lowest response to the occurrence of electrolyte decomposition and negligible capacitance contribution are presented for Ti mesh, along with a high & stable electrochemical window up to 3.61 V in neutral electrolyte and accurate evaluation of the electrochemical performance of electrode. The experimental verification in 21 m LiTFSI confirms that the Ti mesh can indeed work at a record high voltage up to 2.6 V. Operando Raman, ex situ atomic force microscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and self-built electrolyte decoupling system further reveal the process of Ni leaching and generation of Ni(OH)(2) new species in promising neutral electrolyte for commonly used Ni foam current collector. This work supplies theoretical support for the choice of current collectors in high-voltage aqueous supercapacitors and the design of catalysts, and intrinsic activity decoupling in the electrocatalytic conversion of small molecules related to aqueous electrolytes.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			1616-301X	1616-3028		WOS:000811577100001

To date, surface defect and morphology dependent photoactivity has been explored by using different nanostructured photocatalysts. Among them CeO2 based materials have recently received foremost interest, due to their easily tunable surface structure and low formation energy for surface defects. Therefore, in this review we have comprehensively summarized the recent achievements and progress in surface defect enriched low dimensional nanostructured CeO2 and CeO2 based heterostructure photocatalysts towards clean fuel generation reactions such as water splitting, CO2 reduction, N-2 fixation and organic/inorganic environmental pollutant removal applications. The present review highlights the design of CeO2 with particular crystal facets and morphology and the positive impact of the crystal facets on the construction of different CeO2 based heterostructure materials (0D-2D, 0D-1D, 1D-2D, 2D-2D, 0D-3D, etc.) with other low dimensional photocatalysts. Next, the surface defects, crystal facets and heterojunctional interfaces responsible for improved photoactivity are briefly discussed with proper experimental evidence and the mechanism along with the theoretical concept is explained. Further, this review sheds light on the current challenges and future perspectives in this research area.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3				2633-5409		WOS:000706705500001

The activity and selectivity of the photocatalytic CO2 reduction reactions (CO2 RR) are crucial for improving the CO2 conversion efficiency. Here, we propose a two-dimensional (2D) Van der Waals (VDW) heterostructure as a potential direct Z-scheme photo-catalytic system to achieve this goal. The VDW heterostructure is composed of a C2N monolayer and a 2D polymeric aza-CMP monolayer, both of which have been synthesized. Our first-principles calculations show that the C2N/aza-CMP hetem-bilayer (HBL) has the spatially separated photo-generated carriers, along with potent visible-light absorption and robust redox ability, which facilitate highly-efficient photocatalytic CO2 RR. More importantly, the Cu-dimer anchored on the C2N monolayer not only effectively lowers the overpotential of CO2RR to the level that can be offered by photogenerated carriers, but also achieves high selectivity towards photocatalytic production of CH4 from CO2. This study ushers in a new avenue for improving the solar-to-fuel energy conversion efficiency.									11	1	0	0	0	0	11			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000608494900008

However, the understanding behind the intrinsic and morphological factors contributing to the catalytic properties of FeN4 sites is still lacking. By using a Fe-N-C model catalyst derived from the ZIF-8, we deconvoluted three key morphological and structural elements of FeN4 sites, including particle sizes of catalysts, Fe content, and Fe-N bond structures. Their respective impacts on the CO2RR were comprehensively elucidated. Engineering the particle size and Fe doping is critical to control extrinsic morphological factors of FeN4 sites for optimal porosity, electrochemically active surface areas, and the graphitization of the carbon support. In contrast, the intrinsic activity of FeN4 sites was only tunable by varying thermal activation temperatures during the formation of FeN4 sites, which impacted the length of the Fe-N bonds and the local strains. The structural evolution of Fe-N bonds was examined at the atomic level. First-principles calculations further elucidated the origin of intrinsic activity improvement associated with the optimal local strain of the Fe-N bond.									80	6	0	0	6	0	80			1433-7851	1521-3773		WOS:000588414000001	33002266

Low Pt loading and large-scale application are practical for economic consideration. Here we replace the typical hydrophobic agent polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) with commercial fluorinated carbon (CFx) to fabricate hydrogen evolution reaction electrodes with a simplified gas diffusion electrode method. The Pt loading can be reduced as low as 0.03 mg cm(-2) without performance loss, and the electrode fabrication method is easy for mass production. Cyclic voltammetry shows CFx electrode has a high Pt Electrochemical surface area (ECSA) as much as 321 m(2) g(-1), and larger than that of PTFE electrode, the Pt utilization increases 12%. Besides, scanning electron microscopy and pore analysis indicate the excellent performance of CFx electrode is related to the more reasonable three-phase boundaries, especially for the improved proton transfer. In addition, the performance differs with the ratio of CFx and content of CFx. We believe the application of CFx in proton exchange membrane water electrolysis has great economic potential due to the ultralow Pt consumption and easy electrode fabrication process.									2	0	0	0	1	0	2			1452-3981			WOS:000519545900024

Among these, supercritical deposition (SCD) is an emerging technique to incorporate metals on supports. It has been used to deposit a wide variety of single or multi-metallic morphologies such as highly dispersed species, nanoparticles, nanorods and conformal films on high surface area supports, polymers and crystalline substrates. SCD is also attracting increasing attention for preparation of micro or nano-architectured functional materials in a highly controllable manner for electrochemical energy conversion and storage systems. Increasing number of studies in the literature demonstrates that materials synthesized using SCD are comparable or superior in performance as compared to their conventional counterparts. In this review, an overview of the fundamentals of the SCD technique is presented. Properties of a wide variety of nanostructured functional materials such as supported nanoparticles and films prepared using SCD for electrochemical applications are summarized. The electrochemical performance of these materials in electrochemical tests and also in fuel cells, electrolyzers and Li-ion batteries are also presented. (C) 2020 The Author(s).

Compared with the parent mpg-CN, the optimal 1% PdCl2 modified mpg-CN increased the conversion efficiency by approximately 33%, improved the inhibiting efficiency of NO2 release by approximately three times, and promoted the long term stability of photocatalysts for NO removal in a continuous flow model reaction system. The prepared samples were characterized by X-ray diffraction, transmission electron microscopy with energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy elemental mapping, ultraviolet-visible light absorbance spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, photoluminescence emission spectroscopy and electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy. The ultrafast charge separation and efficient generation of O-2-oxygen species were achieved by the charge transfer model of PdCl2/mpg-CN similar to the solid-state Z-scheme system.

In this article, we present a systematic study on structural and thermal stabilities of Pt-Pd bimetallic nanoparticles with core shell and alloyed structures by using atomistic simulations. It was revealed that the Pd-core/Pt-shell structures are the least structurally stable, while the inverted Pt-core/Pd-shell nanoparticles are more stable than the alloyed ones when the Pt percentage exceeds 42% or so. The origin for this order was clarified through analysis of atomic energy distribution in these structures. Furthermore, the core-shell structures exhibit enhanced thermal stability as compared to the alloyed ones for Pt composition more than about w30%. The diverse melting behaviors of bimetallic nanoparticles, associating with their thermally driven structural evolutions under the heating process, were characterized by the measurement of the Lindemann index In addition, the analyses of diffusion behavior and atomic distribution suggest that the minimization of surface energy tends to form Pd surface segregation. This study is of considerable importance not only to experimental preparation of Pt-Pd nanocatalysts but also to design of bimetallic (even multimetallic) nanostructures of high catalytic activity and excellent stability.									97	6	0	0	1	1	97			1932-7447			WOS:000302924900037

Yet, the precise role of such defects during the OER is not fully understood, which in turn precludes an efficient optimization of their catalytic activity. Herein, CoNiSe2 film, representing a multi-transition metal selenide model with selenium defects, is electro-deposited on a carbon cloth to investigate and optimize the intrinsic and dynamic behavior of selenium vacancies during the OER process. Interestingly, the defective CoNiSe2 with the optimized amount of selenium vacancies exhibits an advanced OER performance, including low overpotential (252 mV at 10 mA cm-2) and high stability for 30 h. The ex-situ XPS and Raman spectroscopies also indicate that the optimized amount of selenium vacancies can facilitate the pre-oxidation of Co and Ni sites. The latter leads to a rapid adsorption of OH- ions and a further stabilization of Co/NiOOH, which in turn mediates the efficiency of OER. The density functional theory (DFT) calculations show that the introduction of a Se-vacancy on CoNiSe2 surface enables to adjust the changes in Gibbs free energy between different OER steps and thereby, significantly reduce the overpotential.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			0378-7753	1873-2755		WOS:000707635400003

Molecular catalysts offer precise control of structure that enables understanding of structure-reactivity relationships, which can be difficult to achieve with heterogeneous catalysts. Molecular electrocatalysts can be immobilized on surfaces by covalent bonds or through non-covalent interactions. Advantages of surface immobilization include the need for less catalyst, avoidance of bimolecular decomposition pathways, and easier determination of catalyst lifetime. This Minireview highlights surface immobilization of molecular electrocatalysts for reduction of O-2, oxidation of H2O, production of H-2, and reduction of CO2.									115	3	0	0	8	0	115			0947-6539	1521-3765		WOS:000402799200001	28178367

It was established that ANT-2p is irreversibly oxidized and reduced in aprotic solvents at potentials of 1.35 V and -0.03 V, respectively. Oxidation (E = 0.45 V) and reduction (E = 0.27 V) products were detected by analyzing cyclic voltage-current curves. The capacity of ANT-2p for interacting with PS II presumably depends on the redox potential of the original molecule and the degree of irreversibility of the process. Two possible mechanisms of the effect of ANT-2p on the operation of PS II are discussed. ANT-2p may interact with the acceptor side of PS II, the primary reaction step being ANT-2p oxidation (the oxidative pathway). However, a reductive pathway is more probable in energetic terms. It involves primary reduction of ANT-2p on the acceptor side of PS II with subsequent electron transfer to any oxidized component on the donor side, predominantly the manganese cluster. This process regenerates the original ANT-2p molecule, which accounts for the catalytic effect of ANT-2p as PS II inhibitor and the ADRY effect of ANT-2p in PS II.									1	0	0	0	1	0	1			0006-2979			WOS:A1995RX89300018

Electrochemical deposition of single-phase nickel phosphide on galvanostatically deposited copper foam (Cuf@Ni5P4) core-shell nanostructure offers an innovation in the structural design of a new platform for novel electrocatalysts. The Cuf@Ni5P4 provides a superior three-dimensional conductive channel for ion transport during the catalytic process. The catalyst exhibits an excellent electrocatalytic activity towards the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in acidic media. The superhydrophilic and aerophobic properties of the porous electrode help the H-2 gas bubbles to quickly leave the surface. Interestingly, it requires a very low overpotential of 90 mV for HER at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2). The very small Tafel slope of 49 mV dec(-1) and the very high exchange current density (similar to 0.76 mA cm(-2)) originate from the large electrochemically active surface area and the fast mass and electron transfer efficiency of the Cuf@Ni5P4 catalyst. A theoretical study was performed to investigate the mechanism underlying the HER activity in Cu-supported Ni5P4 at an atomic scale. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations suggest a very high negative Gibbs free energy change (Delta G(H*)) in Ni5P4 (0001)/Cu (111) upon hydrogen adsorption, which is actually responsible for the excellent HER activity of the catalyst. Furthermore, it shows remarkable durability for hydrogen generation under low (10 mA cm(-2)) and high current densities (160 mA cm(-2)) for >84 h with similar to 96% retention of the overpotential, establishing a low-cost and efficient catalyst for sustainable, future energy generation strategies.									35	0	0	0	2	0	35			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000508175800047

It increased fourfold to fivefold at pH 8.5-9.0. The addition of either artificial electron donors for PSII such as MnCl2 or diphenylcarbazide, or diuron as an inhibitor of electron transfer from Q(A), the primary bound quinone acceptor, to Q(B), the secondary bound quinone acceptor of PSII, resulted in a decrease in oxygen consumption rate at basic pH to value close to ones measured at pH 6.5. Such additions did not affect oxygen consumption at lower pH values. The induction of variable chlorophyll fluorescence yield in the light differed greatly at pH 6.5 and 8.5. While at pH 6.5 the fluorescence yield, after an initial fast rise almost to F-max, only slightly decreased, at pH 8.5 after such a rise it dropped promptly to a low value. The additions of the artificial electron donors at pH 8.5 resulted in the induction kinetics close to that observed at pH 6.5. These data indicate impairment of electron donation to P680(+) that could be caused by damage to the water oxidation system at basic pH values. In experiments with PSII preparations treated with Tris to destroy the water-oxidizing complex, photoconsumption of oxygen in the entire pH region was close to the values in untreated preparations at basic pH. In untreated preparations the rate of light-induced oxygen consumption decreased in the presence of catalase, which decomposes H2O2, as well as in the presence of electron acceptor potassium ferricyanide. From these data it is suggested that the light-induced oxygen consumption in PSII is caused by two processes, by an interaction Of O-2 with organic radicals, which were formed due to oxidation of components of the donor side of this photosystem (proteins, lipids, pigments) by cation-radical P680(+), as well as by oxygen reduction by still unidentified components of PSII.									23	0	0	0	18	0	23			0006-2979			WOS:000176742000011	12126477

The purified PS II complex was essentially devoid of phycobiliproteins and other contaminating components, and showed a high oxygen-evolving activity of 2375 mu mol O-2/mg Chl per h using phenyl-p-benzoquinone as the electron acceptor. The expression of this high activity did not require addition of exogenous Ca2+, although EDTA reduced the activity by 40%. This effect of EDTA can be reversed not only by Ca2+ but also by Mg2+; a similar Mg2+ effect has been observed in purified cyanobacterial PS II but not in higher plant PS II. Immunoblotting analysis indicated the presence of major intrinsic polypeptides commonly found in PS II from cyanobacteria and higher plants as well as the extrinsic 33 kDa protein. Antibodies against the extrinsic 23 and 17 kDa proteins of higher plant PS II, however, did not crossreact with any polypeptides in the purified PS II, indicating the absence of these proteins in the red alga. In contrast, two other extrinsic proteins of 17 and 12 kDa were present in the red algal PS II; they were released by I M Tris or Urea/NaCl treatment but not by 1 M NaCl. The 17 kDa polypeptide was identified to be cytochrome c-550 from heme-staining, immunoblot analysis and N-terminal amino acid sequencing, and the 12 kDa protein was found to be homologous to the 12 kDa extrinsic protein of cyanobacterial PS II from its N-terminal sequence. These results indicate that PS II from the red alga is closely related to PS II from cyanobacteria rather than to that from higher plants, and that the replacement of PS II extrinsic cytochrome c-550 and the 12 kDa protein by the extrinsic 23 and 17 kDa proteins occurred during evolution from red algae to green algae and higher plants.									73	1	1	0	67	0	76			0005-2728			WOS:A1995TL77200007	8534673

However, the practical utilization of Mn-based oxides in these acidic technologies has been severely hindered by their dissolution at low pHs. Designing Mn-based oxides with enhanced durability in acid requires a fundamental understanding of the physical origin of their instability. In this work, combining dissolution kinetic studies and first-principles calculations, we systematically quantified the dissolution of Mn-based oxides in acid and identified intrinsic material descriptors that govern their acid stability. We found that lowering the Mn oxidation states in Mnbased oxides to decrease Mn-O covalency and weaken Mn-O bonds led to greater driving forces for critical reaction steps, including protonation, vacancy formation, and ion solvation, rendering poorer stability and faster dissolution kinetics upon exposure to acid. Such correlations for the stability of oxides in acid were further validated by a computational screening of similar to 1000 Mn-based oxides. Notably, limiting the fraction of ionic substituents in oxides and using metal substituents with greater electronegativity/acidity were found to stabilize Mn-based oxides against dissolution in acid. These findings establish new guiding principles to design and optimize oxides with enhanced durability in acid for clean energy applications.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0897-4756	1520-5002		WOS:000848590400001

In this paper, effects of temperature (400-900 degrees C), retention time and secondary reaction on the release and distribution of AAEMs in products and evolution in the char were systematically investigated during fractional tissues of corn stalk pyrolysis. Results reveal temperature is the crucial factor for AAEMs release and transformation. < 700 degrees C, AAEMs, except Na, was metastable in char. However, ion-exchangeable AAEMs slightly convert by interaction with oxygen-containing active sites. At 900 degrees C, release of AAEMs increased abruptly by the form of salts steam. And spherical or broken bubbles on the molten surface, especially for > 700 degrees C, impenetrate polymer channel and promote the entrainment of AAEMs by aerosol. The enrichment of Si and Al retain them again in the char by the form of acid-soluble and insoluble matter. Compared to char pyrolysis stage, release of AAEMs during devolatilization was lower. Hence, collision probability of AAEMs with oligomers was less likely that leads to inclinable distribution in the aerosol. Simultaneously, longer traveling time-restricted escape from the path of particle clearance.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1556-7036	1556-7230		WOS:000636130400001

Here, we use the fine fluorescence energy resolution of a RIXS spectrometer to obtain various proxies of the Mn-L edge X-ray absorption spectra (XAS) of the perovskite La0.6Sr0.4MnO3 (LSMO) as a model catalyst for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and evaluate the suitability for in situ surface studies of this electrocatalyst. We conclude that the inverse partial fluorescence yield (IPFY) of the O 2p-ls transition and the partial fluorescence yield of the 3s-2p transition (3s-PFY) are most suitable for determining changes at the surface of the perovskite because distortions at grazing incidence measurements are low. In particular, the negligible angular dependence of the 3s-PFY spectra can be perfectly simulated by using a fluorescence model in the thin sample limit which is justified by low reabsorption of 3s photons. Remarkably, the 3s-PFY reveals an influence of water vapor on the electronic reconstruction of the LSMO surface. Thus, our work paves the road for quantitative distortion-free X-ray spectroscopy of transition metal oxide surfaces under in situ conditions, which is needed to understand fundamental chemical processes such as corrosion and catalysis.									3	0	0	0	1	0	3			1932-7447	1932-7455		WOS:000526331500033

The electrochemical oxidation behavior of anode as well as microstructural evolutions of formed oxide scale were systematically studied. The electrochemical characterization and reaction mechanism of the cathode oxide were also investigated to evaluate the influence of alloy anode on cathodic reduction process. The in situ formed three-layered oxide scale is compact and coherent, which is composed of an outermost Fe2O3 + FeAl2O4 skin layer, a Fe2O3 middle layer and a FeAl2O4 inner layer. The skin layer has a continuous, smooth structure and shows electrochemical activity. The Fe2O3 layer with a compact structure prevents inward diffusion of electrolyte and outward migration of metal cations. The innermost FeAl2O4 layer shows a loose structure and functions as a buffer layer to improve the peeling resistance of oxide scale. With the continuous extension of polarization time, the inner FeAl2O4 layer is slowly oxidized and becomes thinner, simultaneously, the dense Fe2O3 layer becomes thicker. Ultimately, metal vanadium product with fine rod-like particles can be obtained and the oxygen content in the metal vanadium is below 0.3 mass% within electrolyzing time of 2 h. The corresponding current efficiency is around 63%.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0013-4651	1945-7111		WOS:000723873300001

The composition and morphology of MnO2 were observed by X-ray diffraction (XRD), Xray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The anode deposited with MnO2 layers by PC electrodeposition presented a lower anodic potential of 60 mV and more uniform potential oscillating attractor with fractal dimension of 1.0337 compared with those of DC electrodeposition. In addition, MnO2 layers exhibited excellent corrosion resistance because less intermediate oxide Mn(III) appeared in anode deposits. Furthermore, the cathodic current efficiency improved by 3.11 similar to 3.77% and energy consumption decreased by 5.30 similar to 8.17% after galvanostatic electrolysis for 2 similar to 8 h by using PC instead of DC for manganese metal electrodeposition. As an external control method, PC electrodeposition not only regulated the structure and surface morphology of MnO2 but also affected the anode electrochemical behaviors and cathode manganese metal deposition. Electrochemical oscillations and other characteristics of anode reaction described in this study could inspire future work on promoting the whole electrowinning process.									9	1	0	0	1	0	10			2168-0485			WOS:000579967200043

J	Costentin, Cyrille; Saveant, Jean-Michel								Towards an intelligent design of molecular electrocatalysts								NATURE REVIEWS CHEMISTRY				1	11					0087	10.1038/s41570-017-0087				NOV 2017	2017	There is a need for the quantitative assessment of molecular electrocatalysts, particularly those designed to address modern energy challenges. This calls for systematic benchmarking to help rationalize the wealth of available data and to apply the lessons learnt to the innovative design of more efficient catalysts. For these purposes, it is tempting to examine the relationship between the reaction kinetics and the stabilization of a single primary intermediate by constructing a volcano plot. The attractiveness and inherent flaw in this oversimplified approach stem from accounting for complicated multi-electron, multistep processes with a single descriptor. In this Perspective, we instead advocate correlating the turnover frequency with the overpotential through a catalytic Tafel plot, which provides a much less restrictive and more reliable evaluation of intrinsic catalyst performance. Within this framework, one way to optimize molecular catalysts involves altering ligand substituents to tune the electronic structure of the catalyst. These inductive through-structure effects are subject to an 'iron law', which dictates that gains in the form of smaller overpotentials come at the price of reduced turnover frequencies (and vice versa). This law can be circumvented by instead engineering through-space effects that stabilize the primary catalytic intermediate. These considerations should be based on the patient gathering of reliable experimental data obtained upon variation of the maximal number of operational parameters.									102	0	0	0	12	0	102				2397-3358		WOS:000415244700004

Today, in industrially relevant applications, dimensionally stable anodes (DSA) based on the electrocatalytic active RuO2 are conventionally utilized. To enhance the resistance against corrosion, incorporation of TiO2 in the RuO2-coated electrodes is widely employed. In the present work we have used scanning electrochemical microscopy (SECM) to demonstrate that TiO2-doped RuO2-coated electrodes, in addition to being more durable, also show an electrocatalytic activity that is, on average, 13% higher as compared to the pure RuO2-coated electrodes. We also demonstrate that cracks in the pure RuO2 coating are the most active zones, probably because Ti from the Ti support has diffused into the first applied layer of the RuO2 coating. To reveal the nature of this enhanced activity for water oxidation displayed on TiO2-doped RuO2 electrodes, we have employed X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) for material characterization. The results show that the electrocatalytic activity enhancement displayed on the mixed (Ru1-x:Ti-x)O-2 coating is promoted through a charge transfer from the RuO2 to the TiO2, which provides new and more reactive sites designated as activated RuO2 delta+.									82	3	0	0	8	0	83			1932-7447			WOS:000317032100015

The model considers only the phenomena essential for obtaining sufficiently accurate predictions of soot concentrations to make CFD calculations of fire radiation feasible in an engineering context. It is generalized to multiple fuels by relating the peak soot formation rate to a fuel's laminar smoke point height, an empirical measure of relative sooting propensity, and applying simple scaling relationships to account for differences in fuel stoichiometry. Soot oxidation is modeled as a surface area independent process because it is controlled by the diffusion of molecular oxygen into the zone of active soot oxidation rather than being limited by reaction of OH - radicals with the available soot surface area. The soot model is embedded within a modified version of NIST's Fire Dynamics Simulator and used for a comparison of predicted and measured temperatures, soot volume fractions, and velocities in laminar ethylene, propylene, and propane flames. The basic approach, though promising, is not yet mature and several suggestions for future work are presented. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

Py-GC/MS (micro pyrolyzer coupled with gas chromatography/mass spectrometry) was employed to identify the distribution of pyrolytic products under temperatures of 150-850 degrees C. It was found that the yields of methoxylated monoaromatics underwent tendencies of first increase and then decrease at high temperature. Polyaromatics and benzofuran were only detected at high temperature. Based on experimental analysis, a detailed pyrolysis kinetic model was developed by combining the density functional theory (DFT) and the transition state theory (TST). The homolysis of C-beta-O was the most favorable route for the initial depolymerization of dimer rather than the con-certed retro-ene fragmentation. For the evolution of intermediate products, the breakage of ether bond and the keto-enol tautomerization of enols were the most favorable routes, while intramolecular cyclization and group dissociation exhibited high energy barriers and low reaction rates. The methoxyl in guaiacol preferred to undergo demethylation leading to the formation of catechol. (C) 2016 by The Combustion Institute.

Thus, revealing the evolutionary history of PFO is critical to understanding the origin(s) of eukaryote anaerobic energy metabolism. We determined a complete PFO sequence for Spironucleus barkhanus, a large fragment of a PFO sequence from Clostridium pasteurianum, and a fragment of a new PFO from Giardia lamblia. Phylogenetic analyses of eubacterial and eukaryotic PFO genes suggest a complex history for PFO, including possible gene duplications and horizontal transfers among eubacteria. Our analyses favor a common origin for eukaryotic cytosolic and hydrogenosomal PFOs from a single eubacterial source, rather than from separate horizontal transfers as previously suggested. However, with the present sampling of genes and species, we were unable to infer a specific eubacterial sister group for eukaryotic PFO. Thus, we find no direct support for the published hypothesis that the donor of eukaryote PFO was the common alpha-proteobacterial ancestor of mitochondria and hydrogenosomes. We also report that several fungi and protists encode proteins with PFO domains that are likely monophyletic with PFOs from anaerobic protists. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, PFO domains combine with fragments of other redox proteins to form fusion proteins which participate in methionine biosynthesis. Our results are consistent with the view that PFO, an enzyme previously considered to be specific to energy metabolism in amitochondriate protists, was present in the common ancestor of contemporary eukaryotes and was retained, wholly or in part, during the evolution of oxygen-dependent and mitochondrion-bearing lineages.									99	1	0	0	96	0	103			0737-4038	1537-1719		WOS:000082431300017	10486982

Such top-down exfoliation produced 2D materials and their dispersions have several advantages including low cost, scalable production capability, solution processability, and versatile functionalities stemming from the large number of species of layer materials, and show promising potential in many applications. In recent years, many new methods have been developed for exfoliating layer materials to 2D materials for different application purposes. In this review the different exfoliation approaches are first systematically analyzed from the viewpoint of methodology, and the advantages and disadvantages of each method are compared. Second, the assembly of exfoliated 2D materials into macrostructures by solution-based techniques is summarized. Third, the state-of-the-art applications of 2D material dispersions and their assemblies in electronics and optoelectronics, electrocatalysis, energy storage, etc., are discussed. Finally, insights and perspectives on current research challenges and future opportunities regarding the exfoliation and applications of 2D materials in dispersions are considered.									309	32	0	0	16	0	314			0306-0012	1460-4744		WOS:000441712800005	29905344

Therefore the need for hydrogen is experiencing a very rapid growth. At the same time, the traditional hydrogen production methods (e. g., steam methane reforming, water electrolysis) are energy and resources intensive. Thus, research focus is on sustainable technologies that can produce hydrogen in an economic and environmental friendly way. Hydrogen production via a solar driven hybrid sulfur-ammonia water splitting cycle (HySA) developed at Florida Solar Energy Center is such a promising technology. For this reason, it is important to design and study, beyond the conceptual level, an efficient and realizable production process. Based on extensive preliminary works a state-of-the-art process has been proposed that integrates a solar-photocatalytic hydrogen production step (driven by the photonic portion of solar irradiance) with a high-temperature solar thermochemical oxygen evolution step (driven from the thermal portion) and efficient thermal energy storage as part of the cycle operation. Present work investigates the theoretical and engineering aspects of the proposed HySA process. It also provides an updated assessment and discussion of the related cycles and developments, of the photocatalysts, and analyzes the thermodynamics and implications of the reactions involved.

The outcomes presented typical dyes and antibiotics, such as methyl orange (MO), rhodamine B tetracycline, and metronidazole all can be efficiently eliminated in this synergistic process. Under the optimal conditions (1 mmol L-1 PDS, 30 mu mol L-1 Fe2+ and 30 mu mol L-1 PCA), the MO removal reached 100% within 80 min at pH 6.7. Furthermore, this system could perform well under the broad pH span (3-7) and realize the effective Fe3+/Fe2+ cycle. The masking test and electron paramagnetic resonance demonstrated sulfate radical (SO4 center dot-), hydroxyl radical, and singlet oxygen were responsible for MO elimination in the cooperative process, and SO4 center dot- was the dominant active substance. The MO decomposition byproducts and their evolutions were researched based on the mass spectrum analysis. The effect of inorganic anions in natural water on the PDS/Fe2+/PCA system was conducted, and the consequences indicated that Cl-, HCO3- and NO3- all negatively influenced the MO elimination. The proposed organic co-catalytic Fenton-like method could promote the development of advanced oxidation processes in water treatment.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1383-5866	1873-3794		WOS:000866458300004

Structural characterizations evidenced that the modification partially influenced the surface area, the pore structure, and the oxygen-containing functional groups of the supports. The techniques of CO pulse, transmission electron microscopy, and hydrogen temperature-programmed reduction were utilized to investigate the dispersion degrees and particle sizes of the active component Pt, and its interaction with the various functionalized supports, respectively. The results manifested that Pt particles loaded on the functionalized PTC-S had the largest dispersion degree and the smallest size among those loaded on PTC and other functionalized PTC (i.e., PTC-K and PTC-NH). Finally, the Pt-based catalysts were successfully applied in the dehydrogenation reaction of methylcyclohexane to yield hydrogen. The results revealed that the Pt catalyst over the functional PTC-S support exhibited a more excellent conversion of methylcyclohexane (84.3%) and a higher hydrogen evolution rate (991.5 mmol/g(Pt)/min) than the other resulting Pt-based catalysts.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0				2073-4344		WOS:000767532500001

However, the low initial Coulombic efficiency (ICE), severe capacity fading and voltage dropping during cycling hinder their large-scale application of LRMOs. Hence, we propose a facile Metal-Organic Frameworks (MOF)-self-assembly coating strategy to modify LRMOs with CoxOy/C coating (LRMO@CoxOy/C). The CoxOy/C layer can alleviate the side-reaction between the electrolyte and cathode materials, and enhance both ion-diffusion and electrons-transportation speed throughout the surface of the electrode materials. In addition, the CoxOy/C layer suppresses the lattice oxygen release and improve structural stability of LRMOs during long-term cycling. Consequently, the LRMO@CoxOy/C cathode shows a high ICE of 91.5% and slow voltage dropping of only 2 mV/cycle at 0.2 C. After 300 cycles, it still delivers a high discharge capacity of 210.7 mAh.g(-1) at 0.5 C with a capacity retention of similar to 80%. This work provides a novel approach to achieve next-generation high-energy density cathode materials.									13	0	0	0	0	0	13			0378-7753	1873-2755		WOS:000652658600001

Polyaniline (PANI) was first prepared from aniline through a chemical method, and gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) were embedded with the prepared PANI via ultrasonication to obtain the PANI_AuNPs electrocatalyst. The morphological, chemical, and electrochemical properties of the electrocatalyst were then determined, and BPA oxidation was investigated with the help of electroanalytical techniques to understand the electron-transfer process occurring at the PANI_AuNPs interface. The results showed that BPA was oxidized through a multistep electron-transfer process without any intermediate chemical step, and the rate-determining step was the second electron-transfer step. The oxidation proceeded as a 2e(-)/2H(+) process with an electron-transfer coefficient of similar to 0.69. These results indicate that the PANI and AuNPs work synergistically to promote the electron transfer from BPA. The quantitative analysis gave a broad linear range and a low limit of detection of 0.4 nM. The sensor was also tested for the detection of BPA in tap water, bottled water, and a canned beverage for real sample analysis. (c) 2021ElsevierLtd.

The level of structural porosity can be adjusted by varying the working pressure during the process. A PEM treated this way can be subsequently coated with a thin layer of iridium, forming an anode-side catalyst-coated membrane (CCM) for applications in water electrolysis. Due to the significantly enlarged surface of the membrane, there is no necessity for any additional, potentially corroding, support nanoparticles to achieve efficient in-cell operation. Moreover, utilizing a rotatory frame-shaped substrate holder and a multitarget deposition apparatus, the sputter-etching process can be used in the preparation of a full anode/cathode thin-film CCM in a single vacuum entry. This structure yields remarkable performance characteristics in an electrolyzer cell, considering its low combined noble metal loading of just 220 mu g cm(-2). Using this completely dry process for CCM manufacturing may facilitate efficient large-scale future production. (C) 2020 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

The most abundant chromite types displaying a large range in grain-size (60-750 mu m in diameter) are the olivine related ones: either enclosed in olivine or intergranular in contact with olivine. Chromite enclosed in enstatite is the less abundant type and shows the smallest grain-size (30-100 mu m), while chromite with a grain size ranging from 50 to 250 mu m in diameter is enclosed in chlorite. The intergranular chromite shows similar composition with the chromite enclosed in olivine. Chromite enclosed in chlorite shows more or less the same composition as the smaller (approx. <400 mu m in diameter) olivine-associated grains. Compositional zoning was identified in the larger chromite grains associated with olivine. Chromite grains associated with olivine (excluding the rim of the larger ones) display a weak but clear trend of decreasing X(Fe2+) with increasing grain-size. Subsolidus re-equilibration reactions between chromite and silicates modified the chemistry of chromite grains associated with olivine and enclosed in chlorite. Chromite grains enclosed in enstatite most probably were preserved from subsolidus re-equilibration, with their chemistry being inherited, above the solidus, at the magmatic stage.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0028-3649			WOS:A1997XD69300002

As ROS can be damaging to biological structures, cells evolved a series of mechanisms (e.g. cell-cycle arrest, programmed cell death) to respond to high levels of ROS (i.e. oxidative stress). Recently, we presented evidence that in a facultatively sexual lineage-the multicellular green alga Volvox carteri-sex is an additional response to increased levels of stress, and probably ROS and DNA damage. Here we show that, in V. carteri, (i) sex is triggered by an approximately twofold increase in the level of cellular ROS (induced either by the natural sex-inducing stress, namely heat, or by blocking the mitochondrial electron transport chain with antimycin A), and (ii) ROS are responsible for the activation of sex genes. As most types of stress result in the overproduction of ROS, we believe that our findings will prove to extend to other facultatively sexual lineages, which could be indicative of the ancestral role of sex as an adaptive response to stress and ROS-induced DNA damage.									65	1	1	0	62	0	67			0962-8452			WOS:000222995100007	15306305

The structural, electrical and optical properties of ZnO films are investigated by X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscope, four-point probe method and photoluminescence, respectively. The ZnO film deposited at 90 degrees C is the most compact films with a c-axis preferred orientation. The cooling rate affects the optical and electrical properties of ZnO films dramatically. The ZnO films cooled at -15 degrees C exhibit the lowest electrical resistivity of 0.525 Omega cm and the strongest photoluminescence in visible light. The increase of the conductivity and the enhancement of the photoluminescence are attributed to the increase of oxygen vacancies in the films. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

In this paper, a one-dimensional degradation model of a Pt-Co alloy catalyst in the cathode catalytic layer (CCL) of a PEMFC is proposed, which can track the catalyst size evolution in real time and demonstrate the catalyst degradation during operation. The results show that severe dissolution of particles near the CCL/membrane leads to uneven aging of the Pt-Co alloy catalyst along the CCL thickness direction. When the upper potential limit (UPL) is less than 0.95 V, it does not affect the catalyst significantly; however, a slight change may cause great harm to the catalyst performance and service life after UPL > 0.95 V. In addition, it is found that operating temperature increases the Pt mass loss on the carbon support near the CCL/membrane side, while it has little effect on the remaining Pt mass on the carbon support near the CCL/GDL side. These uncovered degradation mechanisms of Pt-Co alloy provide guidance for its application in PEMFCs.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0				2071-1050		WOS:000857139200001

The graphene oxide, rGO/Mn3O4, and rGO/Mn3O4/MoO3 nanocomposites were prepared by using the modified Hummers' method, co-precipitation method, and hydrothermal method respectively. Organic dyes such as methylene blue and methylene violet were used for the degradation process. In rGO/Mn3O4/MoO3 hybrid, graphene oxide (GO) acts as an excellent electron conductor and manganese oxide (Mn3O4) decomposes the dye molecules within a short time. Molybdenum trioxide (MoO3) shows good photocatalytic activity towards organic pollutants as well as promotes oxygen evolution reaction. The physiochemical characterizations such as X-ray diffraction, field emission scanning electron microscopy, energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX), FT-IR, and UV-vis spectroscopy analysis were carried out. Furthermore, the photocatalytic efficiency of the as-synthesized ternary composite was recorded as 95% which is much higher than the efficiency of individual components due to the synergetic effect of rGO. Two-dimensional structured GO increases the absorption sites which act as charge trapping centers which help to reduce electron-hole recombination effect. Photodegradation mechanism of methylene blue and methylene violet dyes for wastewater treatment application under ambient conditions has been discussed.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2162-8769	2162-8777		WOS:000695707300001

A temperature analysis performed at NASA reported that Earth's average temperature has increased by around 0.8 degrees C since 1880. From 1950-2004, CO2 emission from the burning of fossil fuels has increased by 79.39 %. India, the U.S., China, being the highest CO2 emitters of the world, are bearing an economic loss of $206 billion, $254 billion, and $243.6 billion, respectively. This depletion of fossil fuel reserves and the impacts of anthropogenic CO2 can be mitigated by electrochemically reducing CO2 to generate chemical feedstock and fuels. In this context, the present article discusses recent research progress in developing various catalysts among p and d block elements to act as a cathodic working electrode with appropriate catholyte for electrochemical reduction of CO2. Further, it describes a promising mechanism to convert CO2 into other products via the electrochemical reduction process and reduction apparatus. The foremost aspect for considering p and d-block catalysts are screened alongside their methods/processes to prepare them as electrodes. Then the formation of various chemical compounds and their allied characteristics using novel catalysts are discussed.									8	0	0	0	1	0	8				2213-3437		WOS:000615070400003

A commonly used catalyst for OER is Nickel oxyhydroxide (NiOOH), but pure NiOOH has poor efficiency unless doped with Fe and Co. We explore the influence of co-doping on the efficiency of NiOOH in the process of water oxidation by using Density Functional Theory +U (DFT+U). We also test the effect of strain on catalytic efficiency by modeling water oxidation on expanded and contracted surfaces of NiFeCoOOH. We find that several doping locations of Co have a similar result as if NiFeOOH had no Co content. Iron is responsible for the high activity at the Fe active site due to the low energy required for charge extraction. Yet, the valence band edge includes Fe, Co and Ni states hybridized which allows better charge extraction during deprotonation. The valence band edge position is higher upon Co-doping, which should allow better hole transport toward the surface. Hence, the presence of Ni and Co atoms surrounding the active site is vital for better efficiency. Moreover, we found that applying strain does not improve the efficiency and therefore a substrate with minimal mismatch should be used for NiFeCoOOH electrocatalysis.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			1867-3880	1867-3899		WOS:000528877700001

Enhanced optical performance is observed as well as the photocurrent density enhancement of 116% (5.38 mA.cm(-2) at 1.23 V vs RHE) compared to that of a pure ZnO photoanode which can be ascribed to improved light absorption ability, enhanced charge transfer, and efficient charge separation. Furthermore, it is obviously seen that the onset potential is shifted negatively while the stability of the photoanode is promoted. This excellent performance is achieved because of the long light irradiation pathway of one-dimensional (1D) ZnO nanorods; a broadened light absorbance spectrum sensitized by CdS with narrow bad gap; a reduced charge recombination rate thanks to the appropriate gradient energy gap structure of ZnO/CdS; and the bidirectional kinetics supplied by the dual Au and FeOOH cocatalysts to facilitate the photogenerated electrons and holes to flow in opposite directions and further promote charge separation. The concept of separating cocatalysts in a photoelectrochemical system is first established, highlighting the sight of an efficient photoelectrode for water splitting and hydrogen generation.									70	4	0	0	3	0	70			2168-0485			WOS:000427092900081

As a case study, a ternary HTlc of formula [Zn0.667Al0.306Ir0.027(OH)(2)]Cl(0.333)0.6H(2)O, in which iridium is homogeneously distributed into the octahedral sites of brucite-type sheets, was prepared and tested as a heterogeneous water oxidation catalyst, using NaIO4 as a sacrificial oxidant. This HTlc showed excellent performance in terms of turnover frequency (up to 113min(-1)), turnover number (>11900), stability and recyclability.									18	0	0	0	0	0	18			2192-6506			WOS:000386078200006	31964089

The electrode at pH = 13 yields a current density of 1 mA cm(-2) at an overpotential of 450 mV, which is promising to be used as an anode in water-splitting systems. In higher overpotential (800 mV), a current density of 7 mA cm(-2) was observed.

Thermal analyses and mass spectrometry of the exposed samples has shown evolution of water and oxygen during sample heating. Observation with scanning electron microscope confirmed the formation of some nanosize phases at the inner sample surfaces. XPS spectra done on the freshly cleaved and on the air exposed (001) surfaces confirmed changes in Ba and Cu bonds.

It was found that an increase in the O-2 mixing ratio resulted in a non-monotonic Mo etching rate (with a maximum of 320 nm/min at 40-45% O-2) while the Al2O3 etching rate decreased monotonically. Plasma parameters and composition were investigated using a combination of a zero-dimensional plasma model and plasma diagnostics by double Langmuir probes. The analysis of etching kinetics involving modelpredicted fluxes of plasma active species allows one to relate the non-monotonic Mo etching rate to the change in reaction probability.

In green tissues, ferredoxins are reduced by photosynthetic electron flow in the light, while in heterotrophic tissues, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (reduced) (NADPH) generated in the oxidative pentose-phosphate pathway (OPP) is the reductant. We have used a Ds-T-DNA insertion line of Arabidopsis thaliana for the gene encoding the major leaf ferredoxin (Fd2, At1g60950) to create a situation of high electron pressure in the thylakoids. Although these plants (Fd2-KO) possess only the minor fraction of leaf Fd1 (At1g10960), they grow photoautotrophically on soil, but with a lower growth rate and less chlorophyll. The more oxidized conditions in the stroma due to the formation of reactive oxygen species are causing a re-adjustment of the redox state in these plants that helps them to survive even under high light. Redox homeostasis is achieved by regulation at both, the post-translational and the transcriptional level. Over-reduction of the electron transport chain leads to increased transcription of the malate-valve enzyme NADP-malate dehydrogenase (MDH), and the oxidized stroma leads to an increased transcription of the OPP enzyme glucose-6-P dehydrogenase. In isolated spinach chloroplasts, oxidized conditions give rise to a decreased activation state of NADP-MDH and an activation of glucose-6-P dehydrogenase even in the light. In Fd2-KO plants, NADPH-requiring antioxidant systems are upregulated. These adjustments must be caused by plastid signals, and they prevent oxidative damage under rather severe conditions.									49	4	0	0	47	0	52			0031-9317	1399-3054		WOS:000256844000011	18494733	
J	Nie, Nicole X.; Dauphas, Nicolas; Greenwood, Richard C.					Greenwood, Richard/0000-0002-5544-8027			Iron and oxygen isotope fractionation during iron UV photo-oxidation: Implications for early Earth and Mars								EARTH AND PLANETARY SCIENCE LETTERS				458				179	191		10.1016/j.epsl.2016.10.035				JAN 15 2017	2017	Banded iron formations (BIFs) contain appreciable amounts of ferric iron (Fe3+). The mechanism by which ferrous iron (Fe2+) was oxidized into Fe3+ in an atmosphere that was globally anoxic is highly debated. Of the three scenarios that have been proposed to explain BIF formation, photo-oxidation by UV photons is the only one that does not involve life (the other two are oxidation by O-2 produced by photosynthesis, and anoxygenic photosynthesis whereby Fe2+ is directly used as electron donor in place of water). We experimentally investigated iron and oxygen isotope fractionation imparted by iron photo oxidation at a pH of 7.3. The iron isotope fractionation between precipitated Fe3+-bearing lepidocrocite and dissolved Fe2+ follows a Rayleigh distillation with an instantaneous Fe-56/Fe-54 fractionation factor of +1.2 parts per thousand. Such enrichment in the heavy isotopes of iron is consistent with the values measured in BIFs. We also investigated the nature of the mass-fractionation law that governs iron isotope fractionation in the photo-oxidation experiments (i.e., the slope of the delta Fe-56-delta Fe-57 relationship). The experimental run products follow a mass-dependent law corresponding to the high-T equilibrium limit. The fact that a similar to 3.8 Gyr old BIF sample (IF-G) from Isua (Greenland) falls on the same fractionation line confirms that iron photo-oxidation in the surface layers of the oceans was a viable pathway to BIF formation in the Archean, when the atmosphere was largely transparent to UV photons.Our experiments allow us to estimate the quantum yield of the photo-oxidation process (similar to 0.07 iron atom oxidized per photon absorbed). This yield is used to model iron oxidation on early Mars. As the photo-oxidation proceeds, the aqueous medium becomes more acidic, which slows down the reaction by changing the speciation of iron to species that are less efficient at absorbing UV-photons. Iron photo oxidation in centimeter to meter-deep water ponds would take months to years to complete. Oxidation by O-2 in acidic conditions would be slower. Iron photo-oxidation is thus likely responsible for the formation of jarosite-hematite deposits on Mars, provided that shallow standing water bodies could persist for extended periods of time.The oxygen isotopic composition of lepidocrocite precipitated from the photo-oxidation experiment was measured and it is related to the composition of water by mass-dependent fractionation. The precipitate fluid O-18/O-16 isotope fractionation of similar to+6 parts per thousand is consistent with previous determinations of oxygen equilibrium fraction factors between iron oxyhydroxides and water.

Current research shows that it is a potential and feasible development direction for precious metal materials to be made into SACs. Reducing the metal content as much as possible gives the single atom catalyst an obvious cost advantage. However, very low metal loading does not always provide sufficient catalytic activity for SACs. In some catalytic reactions, the deficiency of low catalyst loading can be offset by the increase in catalyst usage. But the excessive use of a catalyst may lead to the loss of mass transport and then the power density. The single atom and high loading might seem like a paradoxical concept but for catalysts, the sufficiently high specific catalytic activity evolves into a most critical parameter for SACs. Synthesizing high loading SACs under control will be an important direction in the next stage of development. In this review, we focus on the progress of precursor selection, material synthesis, content of single-atom, and some possible solutions for high loading SACs. Meanwhile, we also propose a single atom aerogel catalyst with high loading, which provides more possibility for the future development of catalysts.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1				2633-5409		WOS:000703054600001

It was found that the performances of these applications largely depend on ZIFs' properties, such as particle size distribution, pore size, and specific surface area, which are essentially controlled by different synthetic methods. Among all the disclosed ZIF-type structures, researches on ZIF-8 are growing since it has high chemical and thermal stability and a flexible structure. Therefore, ZIF-8 was chosen as an example in this review to illustrate how synthetic factors affect the final properties of ZIF materials. We summarize the evolution process of ZIF-8 which is divided into three stages: super saturation, nucleation, and particles. Emphasis is placed on the discussion of the influences of various factors on the formation of ZIF-8. The factors are classified into several types such as various salt sources, concentration of reactants, solvents, temperature, and so on. The challenges, prospects, and outlook of ZIF-8 in the future are presented last. This perspective aims to provide necessary information for industrial synthesis of MOF and other porous materials in the future.									25	2	0	0	5	0	27			2168-0485			WOS:000459367400001

A very thin (<5 nm) protective layer of carbon (C) was used to protect the nanoclusters from oxidation. No oxygen traces were found even after six months, demonstrating that the pure SmCo NCs can be well protected by a thin C protection layer. This result is of significance for the application of high anisotropy rare earth magnetic nanoparticles. Small size NCs experience diffusion-arbitrated coalescence after deposition causing nonuniform size distribution whereas larger clusters show uniform size distribution. Post-annealing SmCo NCs at 500 degrees C transforms the structure into the single crystal SmCo5 phase with hexagonal CaCu5 symmetry. Higher temperature (>= 600 degrees C) post-annealing causes the structural deterioration of the NCs due to reaction between C and SmCo NCs which is a nanoscale effect and was not observed in bulk counterparts even at 900 degrees C. The single crystal SmCo5 NCs have potential applications in high density recording media and permanent magnetic materials. In addition, Sm(Co0.7Ni0.3)(5) NCs were also prepared. As-produced Sm(Co0.7Ni0.3)(5) NCs were amorphous and crystallized at 500 degrees C. The coercivity of the crystallized Sm(Co0.7Ni0.3)(5) NCs was observed as 1820 Oe. These crystallized NCs might be important for scientific as well as future applications.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			2046-2069			WOS:000414780700070

Its presence has been detected in mice, rats and humans. In the current study, the antioxidant capacity and reducing power of this molecule have been systematically studied. C3HOM is found to be a more potent antioxidant than melatonin or vitamin C in terms of its ability to scavenge the hydroxyl radical (HO.) and to recover oxidized horseradish peroxidase to its ground state. The antioxidative mechanism of C3HOM is similar to that of the classic antioxidant, vitamin C, rather than to its precursor melatonin. C3HOM effectively prevents the oxidative degradation of cytochrome C induced by hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). It is speculated that some antioxidative activities of melatonin may be mediated by its metabolite, C3HOM. C3HOM prevents mitochondrial cytochrome C injury and, thus, it is likely to inhibit cellular apoptosis induced by the release of oxidized cytochrome C from mitochondria.									58	0	0	0	41	0	58			0929-8673	1875-533X		WOS:000333425700007	24304286

XRD, TEM, and SEM show that all specimens form a pure-phase tetragonal structure with a space group of I4(1)/amd. The addition of LiF can effectively optimize the microstructure and improve the relative density of LiInO2 ceramics. As x value increased, the er increased from 9.6 to 13.6, Qxf increased from 39,600 GHz to 52,500 GHz, and all the specimens exhibit a positive tau(f) value at the range of 9.6-19.1 ppm/degrees C. The low-epsilon(r) and positive rf in LiInO2 ceramics was investigated by bond valence and P-V-L chemical bond theory, indicating that it was closely related to the rattling effect of In and Li. The concentration of oxygen vacancies was studied by dielectric spectroscopy, indicating that doping LiF can compensate for the volatilization of Li during high temperature sintering. Notably, excellent microwave dielectric properties (epsilon(r) -13.6, Qxf = 52,500 GHz, and tau(f) -18.1 ppm/degrees C) were achieved in the LiInO2 + 3 wt% LiF sintered at 890 degrees C.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			0272-8842	1873-3956		WOS:000693313800001

In this work, we report the design and electrocatalytic properties of chiral CuO@Ni with three dimensional (3D) continuous macroporous framework. With the chiral CuO@Ni as anode, the OER overpotential required to achieve the current density of 10 mA/cm(2) was as low as 110 mV in 0.1 M KOH electrolyte, and the hydrogen production rate of water splitting reaction could reach 1070 nL/s. Moreover, the OER overpotential could be regulated easily by controlling the deposition time of chiral CuO layer on Ni. The high catalytic activity of chiral CuO@Ni for water splitting is closely associated with the Chiral-induced spin selectivity (CISS) effect, the large reactive area provided by its 3D macroporous structure, and the effective cooperation between chiral CuO and Ni foam that facilitated the transportation of spin aligned electrons from chiral CuO layer to Ni. The results shown in this work indicate a simple and promising strategy to improve the electrocatalytic activity of other chiral earth-abundant catalysts for water splitting.

The temperature applied during ptychographic imaging was determined by IR thermography. While using elevated temperatures (room temperature -400 degrees C) and realistic gas atmospheres (1 bar) we achieved for the first time a spatial resolution of about 20 nm during hard X-ray ptychography. The annealing of pure and ceria stabilized nanoporous gold in different atmospheres revealed that the conditions have a tremendous influence on the coarsening. The porous structure of the samples was stable up to approximately 800 degrees C in vacuum, whereas pronounced changes and coarsening were observed already at approximately 300 degrees C in oxygen containing atmospheres. A layer of ceria on the nanoporous gold led to an improvement of the stability, but did not alleviate the influence of the gas atmosphere. Different behaviors were observed, such as coarsening and even material loss or migration. The results suggest that additional mechanisms beyond surface diffusion need to be considered and that microscopic studies aimed at more realistic conditions are important to understand the behavior of such materials and catalysts.									16	0	0	0	2	0	16			2046-2069			WOS:000384155100070

Three materials with different hydration degrees have been deeply investigated in terms of structure and microstructure by means of transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and synchrotron radiation techniques such as high-resolution (HR) and pair distribution function (PDF) quality Xray powder diffraction (XRPD), X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS), and for what concerns their electrochemical properties by means of cyclic voltammetry and steady-state I/E curves. The activity of these materials is compared and discussed in the light of our most recent results on hydrous IrOx. The main conclusion of this study is that the Ir core is noninteracting with the IrOx shell, the latter being able to easily accommodate Ir in different oxidation states, as previously suggested for the hydrated form, thus explaining the activity as electrocatalysts. In addition, in operando XAS experiments assessed that the catalytic cycle involves Ir(III) and (V), as previously established for the highly hydrated IrOx material.									83	1	0	0	5	0	83			2155-5435			WOS:000361089700017

A more extensive characterisation of BDD electrochemical properties is very important to understand the reactivity of organic compounds towards electrochemical oxidation on the BDD electrode, which is related to their interaction with adsorbed hydroxyl radicals due to water oxidation on the electrode surface. An oxidation peak corresponding to the transfer of one electron and one proton was observed in pH <9 electrolytes, associated with the water discharge process and electrochemical generation of hydroxyl radicals, which can interact and enhance the electro-oxidation of organic compounds. In pH >9 electrolytes the electrochemical generation of hydroxyl radicals was not observed; ammonia buffer electrolyte gave a pH-independent peak corresponding to the ammonia oxidation reaction. Additionally, for most pH Values studied, a few small peaks associated with the electrochemical interaction between non-diamond carbon species on the doped diamond electrode surface and the electrolyte were also seen, which suggests that the doped diamond is relatively unreactive, but not completely inert, and the electrogenerated hydroxyl radicals play a role as mediator in the oxidation of organics.

X-ray diffraction characterization of the Pt(Cu)/C material showed the formation of Pt-rich Pt-Cu alloys. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy revealed that the outer layers are mainly composed of Pt and residual Cu oxides, while metallic Cu is recessed into the core of the particles. Repetitive cyclic voltammetry in deaerated acid solutions in the potential range between hydrogen and oxygen evolution resulted in steady-state characteristics similar to those of pure Pt, indicating the removal of residual Cu compounds from the surface (due to electrochemical treatment) and the formation of a compact Pt outer shell. The electrocatalytic activity of the thus prepared Pt(Cu)/C material toward methanol oxidation was compared to that of a commercial Pt/C catalyst as well as of similar Pt(Cu)/C catalysts formed by simple Cu chemical reduction. The Pt(Cu)/C catalyst prepared using Cu electroless plating showed more pronounced intrinsic catalytic activity toward methanol oxidation than its counterparts and a similar mass activity when compared to the commercial catalyst. The observed trends were interpreted by interplay between mere surface area effects and modification of Pt electrocatalytic performance in the presence of Cu, both with respect to methanol oxidation and poisonous CO removal.									21	0	1	0	0	0	22			0021-891X	1572-8838		WOS:000329653100002

Ropke, Friedrich/0000-0002-4460-0097			TYPE Ia SUPERNOVAE AS SITES OF THE p-PROCESS: TWO-DIMENSIONAL MODELS COUPLED TO NUCLEOSYNTHESIS								ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL				739	2					93	10.1088/0004-637X/739/2/93				OCT 1 2011	2011	Beyond Fe, there is a class of 35 proton-rich nuclides, between Se-74 and Hg-196, called p-nuclei. They are bypassed by the s and r neutron capture processes and are typically 10-1000 times less abundant than the s- and/or r-isotopes in the solar system. The bulk of p-isotopes is created in the "gamma processes" by sequences of photodisintegrations and beta decays in explosive conditions in both core collapse supernovae (SNe II) and in Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia). SNe II contribute to the production of p-nuclei through explosive neon and oxygen burning. However, the major problem in SN II ejecta is a general underproduction of the light p-nuclei for A < 120. We explore SNe Ia as p-process sites in the framework of a two-dimensional SN Ia delayed detonation model as well as pure deflagration models. The white dwarf precursor is assumed to have reached the Chandrasekhar mass in a binary system by mass accretion from a giant/main-sequence companion. We use enhanced s-seed distributions, with seeds directly obtained from a sequence of thermal pulse instabilities both in the asymptotic giant branch phase and in the accreted material. We apply the tracer-particle method to reconstruct the nucleosynthesis by the thermal histories of Lagrangian particles, passively advected in the hydrodynamic calculations. For each particle, we follow the explosive nucleosynthesis with a detailed nuclear reaction network for all isotopes up to Bi-209. We select tracers within the typical temperature range for p-process production, (1.5-3.7) x 10(9) K, and analyze in detail their behavior, exploring the influence of different s-process distributions on the p-process nucleosynthesis. In addition, we discuss the sensitivity of p-process production to parameters of the explosion mechanism, taking into account the consequences on Fe and alpha elements. We find that SNe Ia can produce a large amount of p-nuclei, both the light p-nuclei below A = 120 and the heavy-p nuclei, at quite flat average production factors, tightly related to the s-process seed distribution. For the first time, we find a stellar source able to produce both light and heavy p-nuclei almost at the same level as Fe-56, including the debated neutron magic Mo-92,Mo-94 and Ru-96,Ru-98. We also find that there is an important contribution from the p-process nucleosynthesis to the s-only nuclei Kr-80, Sr-86, to the neutron magic Zr-90, and to the neutron-rich Zr-96. Finally, we investigate the metallicity effect on p-process production in our models. Starting with different s-process seed distributions for two metallicities Z = 0.02 and Z = 0.001, running two-dimensional SN Ia models with different initial composition, we estimate that SNe Ia can contribute to at least 50% of the solar p-process composition. A more detailed analysis of the role of SNe Ia in Galactic chemical evolution of p-nuclei is in preparation.									122	1	0	0	1	0	122			0004-637X	1538-4357		WOS:000294969800038

The oxidative breakage of the C alpha- C beta bond is an essential part of lignin depolymerization to platform chemicals and is largely dependent on electrocatalysts. Herein, a synthesis strategy is proposed using metal-organic framework (MOF) en-capsulation and sulfuration on the nickel foam (NF) substrate. The robust bimetallic sulfides hetero-structures, named Co3S4/(alpha,beta)-NiS, showed selectively and efficiently oxidize C alpha-C beta in 2-phenoxy-1-phenylethanol (PPE), a typical beta-O-4 model. An ultralow potential of 0.954 V vs RHE is exhibited by NF@Co3S4/(alpha,beta)-NiS for 10 mA cm-2 in alkaline solutions containing PPE, owing to the multiphase active interface and smooth pore channels. A PPE conversion of 93.6% and benzoate yield of 83.8% were reached from the electrooxidation of PPE at 1.414 V vs RHE. Meanwhile, lignin can be effectively cleaved to the main product vanillin. This study develops an inexpensive and stabilized transition metal-based electrocatalyst for lignin upgrading to afford value-added products in the anode side and lower electricity consumption of water splitting.

First, the characteristics of VTM were analyzed by SEM-EDS, XRD, and XPS. Next, effects of VTM dosage, potassium persulfate (KPS) dosage, current density, and reaction time on COD, UV254, and DOC removal of coking wastewater were investigated, respectively. Regardless of the initial pH, the current density is 15 mA/cm(2), COD, UV254 and DOC could be degraded effectively (94.15%, 86.10% and 57.67%, respectively) with the fixed VTM (4 g) and KPS (4 mmol/L) dosage after 30 min treatment due to the coupling effect in 3-dimensional/electrochemical/persulfate (3D/EC/KPS) system. In addition, the formation of free radicals was indirectly demonstrated by detecting the residual amount of S2O82-. On this basis, the degradation mechanism of coking wastewater by 3D/EC/KPS system was proposed comprehensively. In short, the electrochemical oxidation process coupled with VTM as particle electrode activating KPS technology shows a significant coupling effect in enhancing degradation of coking wastewater.									3	0	0	0	3	0	3			0959-6526	1879-1786		WOS:000705662900001

The results showed that the contact angle of the Ag-5CuO/ZTA system rapidly decreased from 81 degrees at 970 degrees C to 45 degrees at 990 degrees C during the heating process, however, moderate reductions in contact angle were observed in the subsequent heating and temperature holding stages. In comparison with the contact angle of pure Al2O3, an increment of about 4 degrees of the stable contact angle of Ag-5CuO alloy on the heterogeneous ZTA was observed. The reaction between Al2O3 and CuO can reduce the damage of the CuO-rich liquid to ZrO2 in the ZTA substrate. Both oxygen and CuO were helpful in reducing the contact angle of Ag on ZTA and enhancing the bonding of the Ag/ZTA interface. The continuous CuO coating on ZTA and the monotectic liquid containing more CuO in the region near the triple line induced reductions of more than 40 degrees and about 10 degrees in the contact angle, respectively, between the initial and the CuO coating-improved wetting systems.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2073-4352			WOS:000665576000001

Herein, we synthesized subnanometric iridium dioxide clusters supported on multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) by a chemical vapor deposition method (nominated as IrO2/CNT). Benefiting from a mild oxidation process in air at 303 K, the deposited iridium clusters can be controlled to have a narrow size distribution from several atoms to 2 nm, having an average size of ca. 1.1 nm. The subnanometric iridium-containing sample is demonstrated to be highly efficient and robust for water oxidation. The optimal turnover frequency (TOF) of chemical water oxidation on the as-obtained sample can reach 11.2 s(-1), and the overpotential of electrochemical water oxidation is 249, and 293 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) in 1.0 M KOH (pH: 13.6), and 0.5 M H2SO4 (pH: 0), respectively. On the basis of the structural characterizations and theory simulation, the extraordinary performances of the ultrasmall iridium dioxide are proposed to mainly originate from enhanced number of unsaturated surface Ir atoms and change of local coordination environment. Our work highlights the importance of subnanometric size of iridium dioxide in water oxidation.									80	4	0	0	2	0	80			2155-5435			WOS:000410005700046

The recent pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 is a concern of major public health emergency globally. The virus is highly contagious, enters through nasopharyngeal route into lungs and infects respiratory tracts and later disseminate to other organs in the body. If body immune response fails to eliminate or over responds to infection in affected persons, the condition turns to severe acute respiratory syndrome or pneumonia, multiple organ failure, septic shock and finally end-up with life in critical cases. Currently, there are no antiviral drugs available to eradicate the complete infection and the only treatment available to patients with critical illness is providing oxygen supply through ventilators along with few antiviral and anti-inflammatory drugs to relieve from the symptoms. Recently developed COVID-19 vaccines are available to the public in several countries for protecting against SARS-CoV-2. Further, researchers are vigorously being focused on development of novel vaccines, recombinant interferons, monoclonal antibodies against virus, finding of antiviral drugs to block coronaviral specific structural proteins or multiplication in infected persons, drugs for suppression of over production of pro-inflammatory cytokines by the human body and disease mechanisms of virus. However, because of combined treatment strategies and reduced pathogenicity of SARS-CoV-2, the current mortality rate has been reduced to less than 1-1.5% globally from 5 to 6% of initial COVID-19 pandemic. Unfortunately, sudden increase in number of cases in several countries and evolution of new pathogenic strains of SARS-CoV-2 variants from existing strains make another challenging task both for public and scientific communities. Hence, public health officials are recommending public to continue social distancing, avoid contact with infected persons, isolation and quarantine of exposed persons till COVID-19 prevention is under control.

Due to declining fossil fuel reserves and increasingly stringent vehicle emission regulations globally, it is essential to shift to alternative energy sources. Economic and eco-friendly fuel-efficient hybrid, electric, and fuel cell vehicles are regarded as one of the best alternative solutions to cope with the government policies and to reduce the rise in global temperature caused by the automotive sector. Technological advancements in fuel cells, batteries, and chargers have further supported the development of electric vehicles. The major challenges of range and charging time in electric vehicles can be countered by range extension technology and developing all-electric hybrid vehicles. In this review, a comprehensive study of different type of vehicles and their architectures are presented. Insights on energy storage devices and converters of electric vehicles currently in use were also provided. Furthermore, various fuel cell advancements and the technical challenges faced during the commercialization of fuel cell vehicles were highlighted.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1527-8999	1528-0691		WOS:000720284800001	34796621

Herein, we report on a novel strategy using AgOx (e.g. Ag2O and AgO) nanoparticles as hole collectors to boost the BiVO4 photoanode to its best photocatalytic performance. AgOx helps to boost the charge transfer efficiency at the BiVO4/electrolyte interface up to 93%, being much higher than 40% achieved for a bare BiVO4 photoanode. AgOx also contributes to improving the photostability of BiVO4 by offering an efficient quenching of the photogenerated holes, which are harmful to the BiVO4, e.g. causing an oxidative dissolution of V. In a pH 7 phosphate buffer electrolyte and under 1 sun illumination, the best BiVO4/AgOx photoanode generates a photocatalytic current density of 4.65 mA/cm(2) at 1.23 V vs. reversible hydrogen electrode. It represents a 2.3-fold improvement of activity in comparison to a bare BiVO4 without AgOx decoration. The current BiVO4/AgOx can be placed among the top-tier photoanodes for solar water splitting made of BiVO4 light harvester. (C) 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

It was found that Mn2+ addition into the zinc electrolytes improved the electrochemical performance of lead-silver (0.69%) alloy anode; and decreased overpotential of lead-silver (0.69%) alloy anode in the zinc sulphate acidic solutions during zinc electrolysis. Moreover, the peak values of oxygen evolution reaction increased with increased content of Mn2+ during cyclic voltammetry study. In addition, addition of Mn2+ onto zinc sulphate acidic solution resulted in decreased corrosion current of lead-silver (0.69%) alloy anode. It should be noted that, agitation at this anodic potential improved the electrochemical performance of lead-silver (0.69%) alloy anode in zinc sulphate acidic solution with varying amounts of Mn2+. Moreover, possible hydrogen ions were attracted to sulfate negative ions on lead-silver (0.69%) alloy anode. Finally, impedance results showed that, the corrosion resistance of lead-silver (0.69%) alloy anode increased with increased Mn2+ addition after two hours of potential decay period.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2158-5849	2158-5857		WOS:000610422600026

CdS photocatalysts selectively deliver N-BB at rates ranging from 5 to 26 mM h(-1). Although CdS is a capable photocatalyst, SEM imaging and XPS analysis reveal significant morphological and compositional changes to the particles upon photolysis in benzylamine. These surface changes and surface sulfide oxidation are accompanied by Cd2+ leaching and hydrogen sulfide evolution, highlighting both redox and acid-base pathways of nonaqueous CdS corrosion. All facets of corrosion have been linked directly with amine reactivity, as the CdS particles are unaffected by substrate-free photolysis. A series of experiments using N,N-dimethylbenzylamine, 4-N,N-trimethylaniline, and ferrocene show that nonaqueous CdS corrosion is facilitated by acidic reaction intermediates opposed to photogenerated holes. Additionally, water and oxygen are essential components to corrosion, as photoelectrochemistry under dry/air-free conditions displays higher and stable photocurrent density as well as material stability. Finally, CdS nanowires display improved corrosion resistance, suggesting that control of particle morphology and/or electronic structure is essential for developing novel chalcogenide photocatalysts.									28	0	0	0	2	0	28			0897-4756	1520-5002		WOS:000410868600063

Two extreme behaviors are observed for electrodeposited hematite electrodes coated with different compositions of catalyst. In the case of Fe-rich catalyst (Ni0.25Fe0.75Oy), the performance is substantially enhanced compared to the bare electrode; however, the Ni-rich (Ni0.75Fe0.25Oy) catalyst inhibits the PEC performance. A combination of photoelectrochemical, intensity modulated photocurrent spectroscopy, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy measurements collectively reveal the critical role that the interface states of the semiconductor and catalyst plays in controlling the key interfacial charge transfer and recombination reactions. The photogenerated holes are efficiently collected and stored into the catalyst layer for the Ni0.25Fe0.75Oy coated hematite electrodes. An unusually large improvement in performance is attributed to this hole collection circumventing recombination at the hematite surface. For the Ni0.75Fe0.25Oy coated hematite electrodes, however, there is a presence of interface trap states that act as recombination centers and pin the catalyst potential. These combined results provide important new understanding of the role of the interfaces at semiconductor/electrocatalyst junctions.									50	2	0	0	3	0	50			0897-4756	1520-5002		WOS:000408519800014

This method induced bulk oxygen deficiency resulting in a narrowing bandgap (from 3.18 to 3.04 eV) and in visible light absorption. The samples were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), BET specific surface area (SSA) and pore size distribution (PSD), UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS), Raman spectroscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The photocatalytic activity of the samples was evaluated by using the 4-nitrophenol oxidation reaction and the photocatalytic oxidation of glucose with H-2 production. In the presence of the sonicated samples the 4-nitrophenol degradation and the glucose conversion increased of ca. 40% and 11%, respectively. A good H-2 evolution was, moreover, observed in the latter case. The Pt-loaded samples showed the highest photoactivity for H-2 production and it can be explained by taking into account the highest value of its working function. The obtained results open new perspectives for the synthesis of novel nano-TiO2-based photocatalysts capable to degrade water or airborne pollutants under visible light irradiation.

The in situ method which includes a single lase step and the ex situ method which uses two lase steps are both widely implemented to synthesize graphene/metal hybrids. However, the differences in the structures and properties of the resulting hybrids are not fully understood. Here, we investigate the advantages of ex situ and in situ methods for preparing LIG hybrids using NiFe/LIG as an example. The morphology, elemental composition, resistance to strong acid, and application in electrocatalysis and dye adsorption of ex situ and in situ NiFe/LIG hybrids were systematically studied and compared. Energy-dispersive X-ray spectrometry (EDS) and vibrating sample magnetometry (VSM) results confirmed the structural differences between the NiFe/LIG hybrids. Metal nanoparticles are mostly wrapped by carbon layers in the in situ NiFe/LIG hybrid, while the ex situ NiFe/LIG hybrid largely exposes the metal nanoparticles. These structural differences are significant for tailoring performance in applications, such as wastewater treatment and electrocatalysis. This work provides insights into the synthesis and properties of LIGs and has important implications for future applications.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1001-0521	1867-7185		WOS:000814928500001

Over the past few decades, WOC research has turned into a fascinating interdisciplinary field that ranges from bio-inspired molecular design over nanomaterials and thin films to solid materials tuning. Under the umbrella of WOC optimization, advanced in situ/operando analytical techniques are being developed as increasingly powerful tools to elucidate the controversial discussions about the molecular or nanoscale nature of many WOCs. More and more of these approaches also enable the monitoring of possible key intermediates as an essential prerequisite for proposing catalytic mechanisms. This review is organized in three main parts: first, recent highlights outline frontiers in WOC development, such as the benefits of connecting molecular WOCs with solids along with the introduction of molecular concepts into heterogeneous WOC research. Next, a brief overview of emerging in situ/operando approaches demonstrates new options for monitoring WOC transformations. Finally, selected monitoring studies over the entire WOC dimensionality spectrum illustrate interesting cases of catalytic border crossings as new input for WOC construction.									161	1	0	0	13	0	161			0306-0012	1460-4744		WOS:000413188900005	28745756

Thus, for the simple materials such as Titania (TiO2) and its composites, was prepared by an easy method and studied extensively. High efficiency photoanode materials require properties like light trapping, electron and hole transportation. To provide a more efficient large scale TiO2 coating, we introduce a high throughput methodology wherein Al2O3 was spurted on titanium (Ti) plate. Photocurrents corresponding to water oxidation, under a standard AM 1.5G solar illumination, in a photoelectrochemical cell using Al2O3 spurted TiO2 film as photoanode was investigated and highest photocurrent of 40 mu A cm(-2) at zero bias vs (Ag/AgCl) was achieved when compared to pure TiO2. The light absorbing capability of the Al2O3 spurted TiO2 photoanode was demonstrated from the UV-Visible diffuse reflectance spectra and decrease in the band gap of 0.13 eV for the TiO2 film was observed which could be attributed to the improved photocurrents due to the increased charge carriers on the TiO2 film. Increase of charge carrier concentration on the TiO2 film could be effected due to the passivation of surface states upon Al2O3 spurting.									4	0	0	0	2	0	4			2365-6549			WOS:000395423400089

The CNTs were grown directly on microscaled carbon paper using catalytic chemical vapor deposition. Both MS and PE methods enabled the quick formation of nanosized Pd particles over a CNT surface without any additional thermal reduction. Cyclic voltammetry and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy were used to examine the electrochemical behavior of the Pd catalysts. The Pd catalyst prepared with the MS method not only offers a higher active coverage for adsorption/desorption of hydrogen but also a more stable durability toward acid electrolytes when compared with that of the catalyst prepared with the PE method. The electrochemical surface area of the Pd catalyst was approximately 1.38 times than that of the Pt catalyst, which was also prepared with MS method. The equivalent series resistance for all the catalyst electrodes was kept between 2.07 and 2.25 Omega after potential cycling. Based on the results, the Pd catalyst is found to be a feasible alternative to the Pt catalyst because of its low cost, durability, and high catalytic activity. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

In-situ sintering microstructure evolution indicated that the activation of B as a sintering aid started with the way that Ni and B from coated amorphous Ni-B reacted to form low-melting Ni3B compounds prior to the formation of Ti2Ni between Ni and Ti. Both low-melting-point compounds were melted to form liquid and significantly increased the amount of liquid by which the sintering densification was enhanced. Another positive role of using Ti@Ni-B powders was the in-situ formation of TiB on each Ti particle by which a high number density of low-energy-barrier heterogeneous nucleation sites and pinning points were produced. This resulted in finer grain and better equiaxed crystallization. The enhanced sintering densification contributed to the improved tensile strength while a combination of the equiaxed alpha-Ti grains, low oxygen increment and reduced porosity were responsible for the increased tensile ductility by 60%.									2	1	0	0	0	0	2			2589-1529			WOS:000536259200001

We investigated oxidation of water on nanostructured Cu2O/TiO2 and CuO/TiO2 systems by density functional theory. Under photoelectrochemical conditions, the most stable structure has a CuO stoichiometry and yields an overpotential of 0.66 V for water oxidation, with the active site being at the interface between copper oxide and titanium dioxide. A lower overpotential of 0.48 V is found on a metastable Cu2O nanostructure. These values are lower than the values for pure titania and for copper oxide. Moreover, in the case of the most stable structure, the active site is directly at the interface between CuO and TiO2 . We therefore argue that a cooperative catalytic effect is at play in this system, beside the known increased photoabsorption coming from the lower band gap. The nanostructures display a stronger adsorption of OH with respect to pristine titania, which is essential in lowering the overpotential and switching the overpotential-determining step from hydroxyl formation to dehydrogenation of the adsorbed hydroxyl. This insight into the water oxidation reaction might provide some guiding principles for the design of improved photocatalysts for solar water splitting.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			1932-7447			WOS:000440520500033

We demonstrate that a polyamine-mediated assembly process to disperse iridium species on mesoporous silica spheres facilitates the fabrication of nanosized iridium oxides under optimal thermal treatment. From comprehensive morphological and electronic structure studies including electron microscopy, UV vis spectroscopy, XANES, and EXAFS, we show that the influence of polyamine is crucial in stabilizing catalytically active iridium oxides in the mesoporous silica matrix. While the functionalization of the silica surface with polyamine facilitates interaction with the negatively charged iridium precursor, the presence of polyamine further enables control of the dispersion and crystallization of the generated iridium oxides during the thermal treatment at 573 K. As a consequence, the catalyst exhibits enhanced activity with higher TON along with desirable stability to allow it to be recycled while keeping the activity intact. The activity and stability of the synthesized catalyst in comparison with those of IrCl3 and IrO2 reveal that balancing between the dispersion and crystallization of iridium oxides is crucial in heterogenization of the catalyst.									11	0	0	0	0	0	11			2155-5435			WOS:000382714000009

Vibration spectra (Raman spectroscopy and Fourier transform far-infrared reflection [FTIR] spectroscopy) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) were employed to evaluate the correlation between crystal structures and vibration modes of these solid solutions as a function of Zn2+ ions replaced by Mg2+ ions. Spectroscopic and structural data show sensitivity to the sample structural evolution with Mg2+ concentration, and a 1:2 ordered structure appears for Mg-rich samples where x >= 0.6. The Ba[(Zn0.4Mg0.6)(1/3)Nb-2/3]O-3 has a 1:2 ordered monoclinic unit cell, which is distorted by the antiphase tilting of the oxygen octahedra.

Effects of nanoporosities film formation and rough structures were examined on the electrocatalytic activity and stability of the anodes. In this respect, the electrochemical response of samples subjected to different pretreatments, including the formation of TiO(2)nanotubes by anodizing and etching in 20% oxalic acid, was investigated by cyclic voltammetry, potentiodynamic polarization, galvanostatic, and impedance spectroscopy. IrO2-Ta2O5-MWCNT coating on the etched and anodized substrate formed a compact morphology with fewer cracks. Microstructural examination of coatings showed that the distribution of active IrO(2)particles was changed by anodizing pretreatment. The charge transfer resistance of dimensionally stable electrode with anodizing surface preparation was approx. 32% lower than the etched sample due to the porous nature of the Ti/coating interface. The addition of MWCNT to IrO2-Ta(2)O(5)coating on the etched Ti anode extended its service life by similar to 70%, while the formation of TiO(2)nanotubes as the result of anodizing surface pretreatment reduced the electrode stability.									2	0	0	0	1	0	2			1735-207X	1735-2428		WOS:000557752700002

Herein, we successfully prepared Ni3Se2/MoSex on nickel foam via a facile electrodeposition method. To understand the electrochemical mechanism occurring in the electrodeposition process, a new model was proposed, providing insight into the nucleation and growth of deposited materials. The as-prepared Ni3Se2/MoSex exhibits splendid electrochemical performance with 82 mV and 270 mV overpotentials to drive a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) in 1 M KOH aqueous solution for HER and OER, respectively. Moreover, a driving potential of 1.57 V is required to reach a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) for a configured full cell with Ni3Se2/MoSex working as both the anode and cathode towards overall water splitting, outperforming the state-of-the-art commercial full cells assembled with noble-based metals. The advanced catalytic performance should be attributed to the numerous in situ formed interfaces, allowing pi-electron transfer from Ni to Mo via O2- bridging, subsequently optimizing the adsorption features of oxygenated species (OER) and favorable Volmer/Heyrovsky reaction (HER). This work offers an effective and scalable fabrication prototype for the preparation of bifunctional electrocatalysts with electrodeposition.									15	2	0	0	2	0	15			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000593021300024	33188380

Previous studies have investigated differences in electrode activity based on the phases of MnO2 involved determining structures and composition ex-situ. Here we compare two preparations of MnO2 films, with differing catalytic activities as prepared, and observe morphological changes as a function of increasingly oxidizing potentials using in-operando Raman spectroscopy. We find that the Raman spectra of the films, both as-deposited and in solution, can be modelled as a binary mixture of amorphous manganese oxide and pure-phase cryptomelane that develop greater cryptomelane (alpha-MnO2) character as the oxidizing potential increases in 1M KOH. Analyzing the Raman spectra using classical least squares fitting, we determine that both films converge on a cryptomelane score of approximately 0.25; concurrently their catalytic activities improve. These results suggest that significant variations in electrocatalytic activity arise from short range ordering in the catalyst that is not easily determined using ex-situ structure determination.

The composites were implanted at room temperature with He (30 key with a fluence 5 x 10(21) at/m(2)) and/or D+ (15 keV with a fluence 5 x 10(21) at/m(2)) ion beams. The materials were studied by scanning and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy, both coupled with energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, and by X-ray diffraction, Rutherford backscattering spectrometry and nuclear reaction analysis. The microstructure observations revealed that the milling operation resulted in severe fragmentation of the Ta fibers. Furthermore, during the consolidation process the Ta phase acted as oxygen getter and reduced the W oxide present in the original material.

The block copolymer PMPS-MPS-P([META(+)][PF6-]), prepared by this method, acts as a "nano bridge" and achieves Ni loading on TiO2 with the help of the sol-gel method + thermal reduction. The atomic loading of Ni on TiO2 is achieved through strong covalent bonding, metallic bonding and the natural physical intertwining effect of the silane coupling agent. Interestingly, it was unexpectedly found that the TiC stable structure generated by this process, the ionization of part of the block polyelectrolyte after the thermal reduction treatment at 773 K and the loading process of Ni all can promote the formation of oxygen vacancy Ov, which facilitates the charge transfer and hydrogen precipitation reaction. It has superior photocatalytic ability and cheaper cost compared to the conventional impregnation dispersion method. These findings provide a new idea to modify the manipulated photocatalysts by defect engineering to achieve efficient photocatalytic efficiency and capability.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1144-0546	1369-9261		WOS:000823805700001

This work is evaluated the effect of electrochemical pretreatment (anodization in alkaline, acidic, and buffer solution) on graphite substrate to be reported as an advanced substrate for PbO2 electrodeposition. The morphological features and electrochemical performance are analyzed by using field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM), X-Ray diffraction (XRD), chronopotentiometry, cyclic voltammetry (CV), electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), Linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) and Tafel plot. The results are indicated that the roughness, porosity, and capacitance are increased after the anodization. Also, the charge transfer resistance is decreased for oxygen evolution reactions on the graphite surface. Although alkaline anodization is provided the lowest electrical capacitance, it is created the highest charge transfer resistance in comparison to acidic and buffer anodization. The deposition of PbO2 on the alkaline anodized graphite substrate is formed the porous PbO2 architecture with small particle sizes and the highest current efficiency. It also is shown the lowest ohmic resistance (0.48 ohm) and charge transfer resistance (2.44 ohm). Therefore, the result can be drawn that the electrochemical activity of PbO2 coated on BG could be enhanced by the alkaline anodization of graphite substrate.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0				2352-4928		WOS:000806608400005

However, as a bulk material its efficiency is low because of excessive bulk, surface, and interface recombination. In the present work, we propose a strategy to prepare a hematite (alpha -Fe2O3) photoanode consisting of hematite nanorods grown onto an iron oxide blocking layer. This blocking layer is formed from a sputter deposited thin metallic iron film on fluorine doped tin oxide (FTO) by using cyclic voltammetry to fully convert the film into an anodic oxide. In a second step, hematite nanorods (NR) are grown onto the layer using a hydrothermal approach. In this geometry, the hematite sub-layer works as a barrier for electron back diffusion (a blocking layer). This suppresses recombination, and the maximum of the incident photon to current efficiency is increased from 12% to 17%. Under AM 1.5 conditions, the photocurrent density reaches approximately 1.2 mA/cm(2) at 1.5 V vs. RHE and the onset potential changes to 0.8 V vs. RHE (using a Zn-Co co-catalyst).									8	0	0	0	0	0	8				2571-9637		WOS:000699775500012

Herein, porous ZnCo2O4 micro-spindles and truncated drums were synthesized by a solvent thermal route first and then with an annealing treatment with the precursors. The morphology and structure of ZnCo2O4 were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and high-resolution TEM (HRTEM). It is worth noting that ZnCo2O4 porous micro-spindles show a high surface area of 65.85 m(2) g(-1) with an average pore diameter of similar to 6.34 nm. The as-prepared ZnCo2O4 materials, especially micro-spindles, exhibited good electrocatalytic water-splitting performance with excellent activity and stability. The ZnCo2O4 micro-spindle catalyst exhibits an overpotential of 0.389 V at the benchmark of a current density of 10 mA cm(-2). The Tafel slope is 59.54 mV dec(-1) and the OER overpotential of the catalyst shows no obvious increase during 7200 s. The high activity, low Tafel slope, and good stability will pave the way for the use of ZnCo2O4 micro-spindles in practical applications.									26	1	0	0	1	0	27				2046-2069		WOS:000385389800065

However, the changes in photosynthesis during lipid accumulation are still unclear for this organism. Herein, the effects of nitrogen starvation on the lipid content, lipid component and photosynthesis of Scenedesmus dimorphus were studied using lipid analyzing, photosynthetic oxygen evolution and chlorophyll fluorescence methods,. The results showed that the total lipid content was increased from (22.4 0.6)% to (36.3 0.7)% during the nitrogen starvation, companied by the increase of triacylglycerol from (4.6 1.2)%to (68.3 2.5)%and decrease of phos-pholipid from (92.8 1.6)%to (26.8 2.0)%. The chlorophyll content was decreased steeply while the respiration rate was increased after 1 day nitrogen starvation treatment. The maximum photo-chemical efficiency of photosys-temⅡ(F_v/F_m) and non-photochemical quenching co-efficiency (NPQ) were kept in a stable level during the first several days of nitrogen starvation, and then F_v/F_m decreased while NPQ increased significantly after 4 days treat-ment. All these changes in photosynthesis might be due to 1) the defensive reaction against the excess light energy, or 2) non-related with the energy dissipation but due to the shift from vegetative growth to secondary metabolism.			栅通过油脂分析、光合放氧、叶绿素荧光等手段,研究了缺氮处理对栅藻(Scenedesmus dimorphus)油脂含量、油脂组分以及光合作用影响。结果显示,总脂含量由22.4%0.6%提高到36.3%0.7%,其中甘油三酯含量由4.6%1.2%提高到68.3%2.5%而磷脂含量由92.8%1.6%降低到26.8%2.0%。缺氮处理1d后,叶绿素含量明显下降,呼吸速率明显升高。缺氮处理初始阶段,栅藻光系统Ⅱ最大光能转化效率(F_v/F_m)和非光化学猝灭系数(NPQ)维持稳定,4 d后F_v/F_m显著降低而NPQ显著升高。上述变化可能是光能过剩引起的防御反应,也可能是自身代谢模式发生转变的结果而与光能耗散无关。						0	10	0	0	1	0	10			1000-3096			CSCD:4922567

However DSC is a micro-destructive technique (sample from .05 to 1 mg can be analysed) because no pre-treatment of the sample is required and so it can give rapid and useful information. The aim of the present work is, in fact, to describe useful applications of DSC on the study of materials used in art. The analyses have been conducted under oxygen flow in order to register the thermo-oxidative reactions of the organic binder or protective. In the first part of the paper, materials of different chemical composition have been analysed to build up a data base of DSC profiles. Standard painting layers artificially degraded by treatment with ultraviolet light (365 nm) for 21 days and with NOx (5 ppm) have been analysed. Comparing the behaviour of the treated to the reference sample, it is useful to study what kind of changes the treatments have produced on the sample. Another possible application of DSC is the study of the formation of the film; analysing the raw, liquid binders and the different naturally aged films an evolution of the chemical structure can be registered.As a conclusion, DSC analyses on standard used in artistic field allow to investigate their thermal behaviour and to understand the effect of natural and artificial ageing.					22nd Italian Congress on Calorimetry, Thermal Analysis and Chemical Thermodynamics22nd Italian Congress on Calorimetry, Thermal Analysis and Chemical Thermodynamics	DEC, 2000DEC, 2000		CAMOGLI, ITALYCAMOGLI, ITALY	15	0	0	0	0	0	15			1388-6150	1588-2926		WOS:000171401300029

Herein, various cobaltate spinel composites with different cations distribution hierarchical nanomicrospheres (HNMs) were rationally designed and synthesized. We found that among the cobaltate MCo2O4-delta (M = Zn, Ni, Cu) spinel catalysts, CuCo2O4-delta DSHoMs show the most substantially promoted CO production rate (26.54 mu mol h(-1) while the CH4 yields of NiCo2O4-delta SMs were approximate to 1.7 times higher than that of CuCo2O4-delta DSHoMs. As collectively evidenced by PEC, in situ DRIFTS, TPD, and theoretical results, NiCo2O4-delta SMs feature promotional charge transferability and super CH4 selectivity, while CuCo2O4-delta DSHoMs feature higher light adsorption, high transient photocurrent density, and preferential selectivity of CH4 evolution. This work unearths atomic-level insights into the correlation between the distribution of metal cations in cobalt-based spinel structures and selectivity regulation for CO2PFR and deeper understanding of the intrinsic relationship of metal species property between various cobaltate spinet oxides which lays a firm foundation for controlling and tailoring of the selectivity of the desired products during CO2PFR.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			1932-7447	1932-7455		WOS:000651787500019

By means of complementary in situ characterization techniques, the carburization process and the final characteristics of these catalysts were investigated. Additionally, the four catalysts were evaluated for the activation of CO2 in the absence and presence of H-2 (reverse water-gas shift, RWGS). The results suggest that CO2 reacts via a dissociation on the carbide surface, forming adsorbed oxygen surface species. Severe oxidation of the carbide into its oxidic phases (MoO2 or MoO3) only occurs at temperatures above 850 K in the presence of CO2. O-2 dissociates on the carbide surface when introduced at low concentrations (1 vol %) at room temperature, but when exposed to higher concentrations, a strong exothermic bulk re-oxidation reaction occurs, forming MoO2. All four catalysts show high RWGS activity in terms of CO2 conversions with a minimum CO selectivity of 98% without any signs of bulk catalyst oxidation. Although minimal, the observed deactivation is suggested to be primarily due to phase changes between Mo2C allotropes (beta-phase, oxycarbide, and eta-phase) and/or sintering of the active phase.									9	0	0	0	0	0	9			2155-5435			WOS:000618540300050

The crystal structure and morphology of synthesized N doped SnO(2)nanoparticles were confirmed by powder X-ray diffraction and electron microscopic techniques. Analysis by X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy confirms that 4.6 % N was present in SnO(2)lattice, while broadband observed in the Raman spectrum reveals the presence of oxygen vacancies and disordered structure due to N-doping. The nanoparticles exhibit high surface area (139.7 m(2)/g) and bandgap close to 3.45 eV as deduced from Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) measurement and Diffuse reflectance spectroscopic technique, respectively. The photocatalytic performance of the nanoparticles was evaluated by water splitting reaction for hydrogen generation using a photochemical reactor consisting of a Xenon lamp and was performed using different scavengers. It was found that out of various scavengers, maximum hydrogen yield, i. e., 169 mu mol/g was achieved by N doped SnO(2)nanoparticles with methanol and the order of scavengers for hydrogen generation using N doped SnO(2)nanoparticles is Methanol>EDTA>TEOA.									6	0	0	0	3	0	6			2365-6549			WOS:000548314000012

Palladium has been shown to make formate with a high selectivity at minimal overpotential. However, production of CO as a minor product quickly deactivates the catalyst during extended electrolysis. Here, we present nanoporous Pd alloys (np-PdX) formed by electrochemical dealloying of Pd15X85 alloys (X = Co, Ni, Cu, and Ag) as active free-standing electrocatalysts with high formate selectivity and CO poisoning tolerance. Rate of deactivation under constant potential electrolysis, due to CO passivation, is strongly correlated to the identity of the transition metal alloying component. We purport that this composition dependent behavior is due to the induced electronic changes in the active Pd surface, affecting both the CO adsorption strength and the near surface hydrogen solubility, which can impact the adsorption strength of active/inactive intermediates and reaction selectivity. Free-standing np-PdCo and np-PdNi are found to exhibit high areal formate partial current densities, >20 mA cm(-2), with high CO poisoning tolerance and minimal active area loss at cathodic potentials, demonstrating the utility of these materials for selective and stable CO2 electrolysis.									49	4	0	0	1	0	49			2155-5435			WOS:000471212600056

The IrO2 was synthesized on the surface of Ta-doped TiO2 support by using the Adams fusion method. The samples were characterized by BET, XRD, SEM, TEM, CV, EIS and polarization curves of single cells. The doping amount of Tantalum (5, 10, 20, 30 at%) was thoroughly investigated to evaluate the effects on structure, electric conductivity and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity of Ta-doped titania supported IrO2. The results indicated that a significant effect of the Ta dopant on the phase composition and conductivity. Among all the catalysts, with the optimized catalyst IrO2 loading, the terminal applied potential was 1.849 V at 1000 mA cm(-2) and 80 degrees C in a SPE water electrolysis cell using 80IrO(2)/Ti0.7Ta0.3O2 as anode. IrO2 loading 80% IrO2/Ti0.7Ta0.3O2 showed better performance than that of the pristine IrO2 after normalizing the current density for IrO2 loading. The increased performance can be attributed to the better dispersion of the IrO2 on Ti0.7Ta0.3O2 resulting in smaller crystallites and large surface area. In closing, Ti0.7Ta0.3O2 showed outstanding promise as an electrocatalyst support in SPE water electrolysis.									16	2	0	0	1	0	16				2046-2069		WOS:000408043100045

Chemical compositions of both mild steel and the agro fluids were carried out to determine the corrosion mechanism for the reaction. Polarization behaviors of mild steel in the agro fluids were determined by Tafel extrapolation curves over the interval of five days for a sixty-day immersion period at a constant temperature of 27 +/- 2 degrees C. The cathodic polarization curves were almost identical irrespective of variation in concentration of the various fluids while the anodic polarization curves exhibited varying active and passive corrosion behavior. Also, the corrosion rates of the alloy decreased with increase in immersion period which could be due to gradual decline in the concentration of the acidic level in the fluids within the given range of potentials. Hence, the evolution of hydrogen gas and reduction of oxygen molecules from the reacting system were presumed to be major factors decreasing corrosiveness of the solution involved. SEM and EDS analysis of the corroded mild steel showed the respective compositions of the mild steel after the electrochemical tests. The result obtained from the study showed that electrochemical corrosion rate over the duration of immersion was in a range of mixture of the fluids > orange juice > grape juice > mango juice > apple juice.

The aim of this work is to investigate the origin of these contrasting trends by simulating space weathering on a subset of minerals found in these meteorites. We use pulsed laser irradiation to simulate micrometeorite impacts on aqueously altered minerals and observe their spectral and physical evolution as a function of irradiation time. Irradiation of the mineral lizardite, a Mg-phyllosilicate, produces a small degree of reddening and darkening, but a pronounced reduction in band depths with increasing irradiation. In comparison, irradiation of an Fe-rich aqueously altered mineral assemblage composed of cronstedtite, pyrite and siderite, produces significant darkening and band depth suppression. The spectral slopes of the Fe-rich assemblage initially redden then become bluer with increasing irradiation time. Post-irradiation analyses of the Fe-rich assemblage using scanning and transmission electron microscopy reveal the presence of micron sized carbon-rich particles that contain notable fractions of nitrogen and oxygen. Radiative transfer modeling of the Fe-rich assemblage suggests that nanometer sized metallic iron (npFe) particles result in the initial spectral reddening of the samples, but the increasing production of micron sized carbon particles (pC) results in the subsequent spectral bluing. The presence of npFe and the possible catalytic nature of cronstedtite, an Fe-rich phyllosilicate, likely promotes the synthesis of these carbon-rich, organic-like compounds. These experiments indicate that space weathering processes may enable organic synthesis reactions on the surfaces of volatile-rich asteroids. Furthermore, Mg-rich and Fe-rich aqueously altered minerals are dominant at different phases of the aqueous alteration process. Thus, the contrasting spectral slope evolution between the Fe- and Mg-rich samples in these experiments may indicate that space weathering trends of volatile rich asteroids have a compositional dependency that could be used to determine the aqueous histories of asteroid parent bodies.

The coordination of organic ligands with metal ions provides high flexibility to anchor metal atoms among carbon materials. Herein, the atomic anchoring of Zn and Ni atoms into N-doped carbon networks with adjustable atomic structure is developed by the facile pyrolysis of metal-organic framework nanoplates in the presence of dicyandiamide. Theoretical calculations reveal the descriptor-based design principles to adjust the bridging structures of metal-nitrogen-carbon moieties with changing d-band centers, thereby improving electrocatalytic performance. The resulting electrocatalyst displays good multiple electrocatalytic activities for carbon dioxide reduction, oxygen reduction, and evolution reactions, enabling the fabrication of integrated energy devices. Importantly, the CO2-H2O overall splitting with the as-prepared electrocatalysts has been driven by the commercial solar cell and the zinc-air battery assembled with the same catalyst respectively, showing high CO faradaic efficiency up to 90%. Especially, the overall solar-to-CO conversion efficiency is up to 13% and the corresponding utilization efficiency of solar-to-electricity can reach 54.4%, demonstrating the large promising space to chase the limit that solar cells can possibly achieve. This work provides new opportunities to modulate the atomic bridging structure of metal-nitrogen-carbon for integrated electrolysis.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1616-301X	1616-3028		WOS:000807559800001		
J	Yin, Zixiang; Liu, Jiaxin; Jiang, Linqi; Chu, Jiafan; Yang, Tao; Kong, Aiguo								Semi-enclosed Cu nanoparticles with porous nitrogen-doped carbon shells for efficient and tolerant nitrate electroreduction in neutral condition								ELECTROCHIMICA ACTA				404						139585	10.1016/j.electacta.2021.139585				FEB 1 2022	2022	The electrocatalytic denitrification emerged as an efficient and "green " technology to remove harmful nitrate from water. Metallic Cu-based catalysts were demonstrated as very active electrode materials but easily corrosion in electrolysis. Herein, an efficient and corrosion-resistant Cu@N-C catalyst for NO3--RR was synthesized on the basis of thermal conversion of a novel Cu-salophen polymer. The formed Cu nanoparticles were encapsulated with thin nitrogen-doped porous carbon sheets, which resulted into a special semi-enclosed core-shell structure. Although the content of metallic Cu nanoparticles in Cu@NC catalyst was only about 1.6 wt.%, this Cu-less catalyst exhibited an efficient catalytic performance for NO3--N with NO3--N conversion yield of about 66% and N2-N selectivity of 93% in Cl--free neutral solution. In particular, the semi-enclosed core-shell structures endowed this Cu@N-C catalyst with the better corrosion resistance in the electrolysis. This unique semi-enclosed structure with porous N-C shells may also contribute to the activity enhancement of Cu nanoparticles for NO3--RR. This work suggests a new synthesis route for Cu-less catalysts with high efficiency and corrosion-resistance property toward NO3-- RR. (C)& nbsp;2021 Elsevier Ltd.

To achieve this goal, we designed and synthesized an efficient full-spectrumresponse photocatalyst based on MoSe2/TiO2 nanofibers. Ultrathin MoSe2 nanosheets with controllable size and density were evenly grown on electrospun TiO2 nanofibers by a simple solvothermal method. Under full spectrum irradiation, the photocatalytic reaction rates of MoSe2/TiO2 nanofibers for the removal of rhodamine B, tetracycline hydrochloride and K2Cr2O7 aqueous solutions were 7.7, 9.0, and 7.6 times higher than pure MoSe2, and were 2.4, 1.4, and 38 times higher than pure TiO2, respectively. The loading amounts of MoSe2 nanosheets have strong effects on their performance. All ultraviolet, visible, and near-infrared light collected by the heterostructures can be well converted to strong oxidizing center dot O2- and center dot OH and reducing electrons, which are useful active species for removing water pollutants of organics or reducible metal ions. The uniform interface contact and hierarchical heterostructure improved their charge separation and transfer properties, whereas their ultralong one-dimensional and nanofibrous network structure ensured their excellent reusable property. This work presents a new vision in designing full-spectrum-response photocatalysts with efficient and reusable properties.									22	0	0	0	3	0	22			2574-0970			WOS:000526396200020

Ag-Co alloys were obtained by cyclic voltammetry from an electrolytic bath. The influence of O-2 pressure (1.5, 2.0, and 2.5 atm) and current density (25, 50, and 75 mu A cm(-2)) on the charge and discharge on the cell were studied. It was observed that a medium value of O-2 pressure and current density was favorable to obtain a high capacity. Energy-dispersive X-ray presented that the cyclic voltammetry technique did not favor cobalt deposition. Scanning electron microscopy showed homogeneity of the deposits with the presence of cracks and small crystals. X-ray diffraction evidenced Li2O as well as the Raman spectra for nickel foam electrode. Oxygen evolution reaction was improved with Ag-Co catalyst according to linear sweep voltammetry and cyclic voltammetry analysis. Steel mesh electrode showed higher discharge capacity (336 mAh g(c)(-1)) when compared with nickel foam (115 mAh g(c)(-1)) which suggests that materials with lower cost can be used as electrodes in Li-O-2 batteries.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			1868-2529	1868-5994		WOS:000486206000008

While the photocatalytic mechanism has been extensively studied, most of the experimental studies have been performed with an ensemble of photocatalyst particles with various sizes, morphologies, and secondary structures. To gain a deeper understanding of the mechanism of photocatalysis, it is indispensable to clarify how the geometric structure of photocatalyst affects the kinetics of photo generated carriers and redox reactions. In this study, the hole decay characteristics and photocatalytic activity of BiVO4, a promising photocatalyst for oxygen evolution with visible light, have been investigated with single-particle transient absorption microscopy. Upon irradiation with 527 nm light, well-faceted nonaggregated crystallites show fast hole decay and little reactivity for Fe3+ reduction. In contrast, aggregated particles with grain boundaries between small primary crystallites show slower hole decay and higher reactivity for Fe3+ reduction than the nonaggregated crystallites. This behavior is increasingly pronounced as the secondary particle size of aggregated crystallite increases. This indicates that grain boundaries in aggregated particles do not work as recombination centers but play an important role in elongation of carrier lifetime and thus in enhancing the reactivity of photocatalyst through trap-detrap processes.									19	0	0	0	2	0	19			1932-7447	1932-7455		WOS:000413131700031

The calculated results indicate that a structural transformation from the pristine (P2(1)/n) structure to cycled (P2(1)/n-cycl or Pmn2(1)-cycl) polymorph would occur in the first charge cycle. Then, Li ions can be reversibly intercalated/deintercalated into/from the cycled structures in the subsequent cycles. More importantly, our results show that similar to 1.5 Li ions can be extracted from the P2(1)/n-cycl Li2FeSiO4, corresponding to two redox reactions of Li2FeSiO4/LiFeSiO4 and LiFeSiO4/LiosFeSiO(4), which can be used to understand the experimentally obtained high capacity of over 200 mAh/g, as well as the different charge-discharge behaviors observed in different experiments. Moreover, the oxidation of Fe2+ to Fe3+ ions is observed upon the first Li removal, while charge balance upon further delithiation is achieved mainly by the oxidation of oxygen ions and partly by iron. Finally, the structural evolution during the charge-discharge process, as well as the Li diffusion mechanism in the P2(1)/n-cycl structure, is also investigated. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

The morphology, chemical composition and crystallographic structure of the films before and after the conversion have been studied with scanning electron microscopy (SEM), atomic force microscopy (AFM). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and grazing incidence diffraction (GID). A thermodynamic model is proposed based on these investigations for the carbothermal conversion mechanism on compact anodic titania films showing that carbon and oxygen contents in the passive film decrease with increasing annealing temperature. The electronic properties have been investigated using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) revealing an increase in charge transfer resistance with increasing annealing temperature. First studies of the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) on TiOxCy indicate that the electrocatalytic properties directly depend on the chemical, structural and electronic properties of the surface since the overpotential of the HER shifts to higher values for increasing annealing temperature. This study is highly important for the production and investigation of conductive and electrochemically stable flat TiOxCy films as model supports for electrocatalysis studies. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

One, called `black tungsten', is mainly composed of tungsten oxides, the other, `reflective tungsten', is constituted by tungsten carbide. The characteristics of selectivity were determined from measurements of hemispherical, diffuse and specular reflectances in the spectral range of 0.25 to 15 mum, immediately after preparation or after annealing in argon, hydrogen or air. The evolution of the crystallinity, composition and surface texture as functions of preparation conditions and annealings was shown by X-ray diffraction patterns and scanning electron micrographs.

Despite promising aspects with earlier reported Rhodamine dye attached GQD system, however, quick deterioration of its HER activity within several hours seriously limits its practical application. We have challenged this stability issue by combining the N/S hetero atom doping in GQD structure and molecular structural elaboration of organic dye. By employing 2,3-diaminophenazine (Phz) attached NS-co-doped GQD (Phz-NS_GQD) as a single component photocatalyst in this work, we could demonstrate a dyesensitized system which sustained over two days without any deterioration (complete linearity up to 50 h was measured) of its HER activity. Higher Apparent Quantum Yield (AQY) values of 49% and 47.7% at 400, 450 nm wavelength respectively were well supported to its improved catalytic efficiency for H2 production. It was shown that the N,S-co doping and the highly efficient photoinduced electron transfer to GQD core facilitated by phenazine dye are responsible for the improved HER efficiency as well as outstanding photostability.

It turns out that the planarity of the single-crystalline IrO2(110) film is lost in that IrO2(110) oxide domains delaminate at a cathodic potential of -0.18 V. Obviously, the electrolyte solution is able to reach the RuO2(110) layer presumably through the surface grain boundaries of the IrO2(110) layer. Subsequently, the single-crystalline RuO2(110) structure-directing template is reduced to amorphous hydrous RuO2, with the consequence that the IrO2(110) film loses partly its adhesion to the template. From in situ XRR experiments we find that the IrO2(110) film does not swell upon cathodic polarization down to -0.18 V, while from in situ SXRD experiments, the lattice constants of IrO2(110) are shown to be not affected. The rooflike mesostructure of the IrO2(110) flakes remains intact after cathodic polarization to -0.18 V, evidencing that the crystallinity of IrO2(110) is retained.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			1463-9076	1463-9084		WOS:000581596800011	33026372

The quantum efficiency of these naturally occurring compounds in optical processes, and the possibility of altering their behavior by modifying its constituent features, make them promising candidates for applications as Dye Sensitized Solar Cells (DSSC) and photocatalytic reactions. The time-dependent density-functional theory (TD-DFT) were used to study the optical and redox properties of chlorophyll and corrin-related molecules (corrophyll). The influence of the substituents and metallic atoms in their properties have been investigated. Our results show lower reduction potentials for corrophyll molecules compared with chlorophyll. The optical absorbance spectra of corrophyll without a metallic atom at their central rings shows a significant blue-shift, as compared to their chlorophyll counterparts. The presence of Co(I) ion species at the corrophyll core leads to oxidation potentials below than that of water, which puts corrophyll ahead of traditional chlorophyll pigments as photocatalysts. We show that the substituents and the ions coordinated to the macrocycles play an important role in this phenomena. These findings show the great potential of tuning the spectroscopic and reactive properties of tetrapyrrole macrocycles for applications in photocatalysis and optoelectronic devices, while keeping their essential structural features intact.									10	0	0	0	1	1	10			0927-0256	1879-0801		WOS:000456022400026

In this study, a platinum/titanium bilayer film deposited by magnetron sputtering was used as a model system to study the influence of annealing in vacuum and ambient atmosphere on structural and electrical resistivity changes. The results show that in both cases blow 773 K annealing the metal platinum is the dominant phase, the alloying and the diffusion happen only at the interface of Pt and Ti. Two different structural evolutions set in when the temperature above 873 K, in vacuum an alloying process promotes with increasing of annealing temperature and metal Pt phase transforms to TiPt8 and finally to TiPt3 compounds, which leads to the increase of electrical resistivity. In ambient atmosphere annealing, when titanium diffused out to the surface of film, the oxidation reaction between titanium and oxygen suppresses the alloying process between platinum and titanium, in this case the metal Pt phase remains in the film and starts to agglomerate, defects such as grain boundary and voids in film reduced due to the recrystallization, results in the reduction of electrical resistivity.

Two distinct rock groups are recognized namely: 1) Peraluminous, oversaturated trachyte-quartz syenite-granite and 2) Metaluminous, undersaturated alkali basalt-nepheline syenite. The mineral stabilities in the light of experimental work estimated temperature and oxygen fugacities indicate that the syenite variants in the Wadi Dib complex are crystallized at relatively high f(O2) above the QMF buffer over a wide range of temperature (1000-450 degrees C).The geochemical attributes indicate that two magmas of trachytic and basaltic composition existing at different depths are required to explain the two rock groups. The differentiation of the ma mas were followed by complex subsolidus reactions of residual F/Na-rich fluids with the magmatic rocks causing the formation of complex intergrowths of aegirine, arfvedsonite, riebeckite, fluorite, calcite and albite.The rocks of the Wadi Dib complex have field relationships and chemical signatures such as high total alkalis and HFS elements (Nb, Zr, Y, La, Ce) indicative to a within-plate source region related to lithospheric stretching, The latter onset after the subduction magmatism ceased as a terminal phase of the Pan-African orogeny.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			0009-2819			WOS:A1997WH75100004

The psbo1 Mutant of Arabidopsis Cannot Efficiently Use Calcium in Support of Oxygen Evolution by Photosystem II								JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL CHEMISTRY				283	43			29022	29027		10.1074/jbc.M805122200				OCT 24 2008	2008	The Arabidopsis thaliana mutant psbo1 contains a point mutation in the psbO-1 gene (At5g66570) leading to the loss of expression of the PsbO-1 protein and overexpression of the PsbO-2 protein (Murakami, R., Ifuku, K., Takabayashi, A., Shikanai, T., Endo, T., and Sato, F. (2002) FEBS Lett. 523, 138-142). Previous characterization of fluorescence induction and decay kinetics by our laboratory documented defects on both the oxidizing and reducing sides of Photosystem II. Additionally, anomalous flash oxygen yield patterns indicated that the mutant contains a defective oxygen-evolving complex that appears to exhibit anomalously long-lived S-2 and S-3 oxidation states (Liu, H., Frankel, L. K., and Bricker, T. M. (2007) Biochemistry 46, 7607-7613). In this study, we have documented that the S-2 and S-3 states in psbo1 thylakoids decay very slowly. The total flash oxygen yield of the psbo1 mutant was also significantly reduced, as was its stability. Incubation of psbo1 thylakoids at high NaCl concentrations did not increase the rate of S-2 and S-3 state decay. The oxygen-evolving complexes of the mutant did, however, exhibit somewhat enhanced stability following this treatment. Incubation with CaCl2 had a significantly more dramatic effect. Under this condition, both the S-2 and S-3 states of the mutant decayed at nearly the same rate as the wild type, and the total oxygen yield and its stability following CaCl2 treatment were indistinguishable from that of the wild type. These results strongly suggest that the principal defect in the psbo1 mutant is an inability to effectively utilize the calcium associated with Photosystem II. We hypothesize that the PsbO-2 protein cannot effectively sequester calcium at the oxygen-evolving site.									23	1	1	0	22	0	24			0021-9258	1083-351X		WOS:000260179900028	18667416

Investigation of Water Oxidation at IrO2 Electrodes in Nafion-Based Membrane Electrode Assemblies Using Impedance Spectroscopy and Distribution of Relaxation Times Analysis								JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY C											10.1021/acs.jpcc.2c05104		OCT 2022			2022	Scalable and stable deployment of water electrolyzers requires the development of in operando analyses to monitor changes in the cell operation due to differing materials or conditions. Here, we present a comprehensive analysis of Nafionbased water electrolysis in membrane electrode assemblies (MEA) under vapor-fed and liquid-fed operation (<200 mA cm-2) using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and distribution of relaxation times analysis. These analyses are used to determine the different processes influencing cell operation and are correlated to in situ methods (Tafel analyses, open-circuit measurements) and morphological analyses to develop an equivalent circuit model for MEA operation. The proposed model can extract the anode ionic conductivity, the Tafel slope and exchange current for the oxygen evolution reaction, electrode capacitance, and mass transport losses from a single EIS spectrum. Further, a contact impedance is observed between the anode catalyst layer and the porous transport layer that is dependent on the porous transport layer identity and cell operating conditions.

The samples are grown using two different synthesis routes: sol-gel and solid-state reaction. Samples produced by both methods present similar structural and morphological properties but small differences are observed in their superconductive properties and vibrational response. The latter is correlated with ab-initio simulations for different concentrations of Pr. We find that as the Pr concentration increases, the presence of a forbidden B-1u mode is enhanced. This is explained by a loss of the centrosymmetric symmetry when Pr is present. The different effects in the Raman modes with Pr content are explained by the change of interatomic distances in the inner cell. Finally, the good correlation obtained between experimental Raman spectra and ab-intio calculations validated the latter, allowing to study the evolution of the electronic band structure as a function of Pr content and ionic radii. Once again, we explained the difference observed by the changes in the atoms distribution inside the unit cell.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			0254-0584	1879-3312		WOS:000582701400079

However, standard theoretical approaches based on density functional theory (DFT) suggest complete poisoning of the active sites and are unable to rationalize the experimentally observed dramatic pH dependence and Tafel slopes, which have a critical impact on the electrocatalytic activity. In this work, we overcome these challenges through a rigorous theoretical investigation of FeNC single-atom catalysts using a combination of several state-of-the-art methods: hybrid functionals, continuum solvation, and potential-dependent electrochemical reaction energetics. Our model shows dipole-field interactions in CO2 adsorption to determine the overall activity, which resolves the contentious origin of experimentally observed pH dependence and rationalizes differences in activity and Tafel slopes among different samples in experimental work. A critical conclusion of our study is that single-atom catalysts can be tuned for electrocatalytic activity not only through the traditionally considered binding energies but also through the corresponding surface dipole moment of rate-determining surface intermediates. Our presented methodology paves the way for accurate mechanistic studies as well as the computational catalyst design of general single-atom catalysts.									50	1	0	0	4	0	49			2155-5435			WOS:000551549800034

The degradation efficiency and toxicity variation assessment were analyzed during the 4-chlorophenol (4-CP) wastewater degradation process. The 4-CP wastewater was degraded effectively and the removal efficiency of chemical oxygen demand (COD) in simulated paper wastewater was 78.2% (anodic), 80.7% (cathodic 1) and 81% (cathodic 2). The toxicity inhibition effect of two cathodic and anodic almost reached 100%, 100%, and 81.0% at 120 min, respectively. The comparison showed concentration for 50% of maximal effect (EC50) of simulated paper wastewater increased with the raise of EC50 of 4-CP. The elimination of toxicity exhibited a hysteresis effect and a rise tendency within 60 min, which might be attributed to the formation of more toxic intermediates such as benzoquinone. A good kinetics model was used to predict degradation of 4-CP and two possible reaction pathways were proposed, featuring a series of steps including cleavage of C-Cl bond, hydrodechlorination, hydroxyl radical addition and oxidation. The Pd-Fe/graphene gas-diffusion cathode was promising to dechlorination and detoxication of simulated paper wastewater containing 4-CP.									5	0	0	0	2	0	5			1452-3981			WOS:000406090700052

The effects of pH in the electrolyte solution on the stability of Li-ion intercalation reaction, the evolution potential of oxygen, and the specific capacity of both the Li-ion intercalated compound and AC electrode materials were intensively investigated by cycling voltammetry and charge/discharge tests in 1 M Li2SO4 solutions with various pH values from pH 7 to 13. LiMn2O4 shows stable Li-ion intercalation in the solution over pH 7, LiCo1/3Ni1/3Mn1/3O2 over pH 11, and LiCoO2 over pH 9. Under optimal conditions, the specific energy, rate capability, and cycling performance of hybrid cells based on the three kinds of positive electrodes and AC negative electrode were compared. There was no significant difference in the specific energy among the three hybrid cells, but the hybrid cell based on the LiMn2O4 showed good cycling life and rate capability. LiCoO2 also had good rate capability but with poor cycling performance, and LiCo1/3Ni1/3Mn1/3O2 showed good cycling life but with poor rate capability.

This makes technology such as direct water splitting from harvesting solar energy in photoelectrochemical (PEC) systems potentially attractive due to its a promising route for environmentally benign hydrogen production. In this study, undoped and nickel-doped molybdenum oxide photoanodes (called photoanodes S-1 and S-2 respectively) were synthesized through electrodeposition by applying -1.377 V vs Ag/AgCl (3 M KCl) for 3 hours on an FTO-coated glass substrate immersed in molibdatecitrate aqueous solutions at pH 9. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM), atomic force microscopy (AFM), energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) were used for microstructural and compositional characterizations of the photoanodes. In addition, the optical and photoelectrochemical characterizations of these photoanodes were performed by UV-Visible spectroscopy, and linear scanning voltammetry (LSV) respectively. The results showed that all the photoanodes produced exhibit conductivity and catalytic properties that make them attractive for water splitting application in a photoelectrochemical cell. In this context, the photoanode S-2 exhibited better photocatalytic activity than the photoanode S-1. In addition, photoanode S-2 had the lowest optical band-gap energy value (2.58 eV), which would allow better utilization of the solar spectrum.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2093-8551			WOS:000829005200007

Herein, we report the exploration of the reactivity and active sites of Ni-N-C for the CO2RR. Single atom Ni coordinated with N confined in a carbon matrix was prepared through thermal activation of chemically Ni-doped zeolitic imidazolate frameworks (ZIFs) and directly visualized by aberration-corrected scanning transmission electron microscopy. Electrochemical results show the enhanced intrinsic reactivity and selectivity of Ni-N sites for the reduction of CO2 to CO, delivering a maximum CO faradaic efficiency of 96% at a low overpotential of 570 mV. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations predict that the edge-located Ni-N2+2 sites with dangling bond-containing carbon atoms are the active sites facilitating the dissociation of the C-O bond of the *COOH intermediate, while bulk-hosted Ni-N-4 is kinetically inactive. Furthermore, the high capability of edge-located Ni-N-4 being able to thermodynamically suppress the competitive hydrogen evolution is also explained. The proposal of edge-hosed Ni-N2+2 sites provides new insight into designing high-efficiency Ni-N-C for CO2 reduction.									44	2	0	0	2	0	46			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000501213600003

It is known that the improvement of catalytic properties depends both from the composition and from the structural arrangement of atoms in bimetallic nanoparticles. This leads to importance of the experimental determination of the nanoparticles architecture (random solid solution, Janus, core-shell or "gradient'') for the search of novel bimetallic systems. We considered the platinum-copper nanoparticles synthesized by simultaneous or multistage sequential depositions of metals. The insight of the architecture of bimetallic PtCu nanoparticles was obtained by the study of radial distribution functions (RDFs) of metal atoms. The RDFs were obtained both theoretically, using molecular dynamics simulations, and experimentally, from the analysis of the extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) spectra at Pt L-3- and Cu K-edges. Machine learning (ML) algorithms revealed the outstanding sensitivity of the theoretical RDFs to the architecture of the bimetallic nanoparticles: the correct architecture can be determined with 99 % confidence in terms of F1 score. The application of the variety of ML classification methods to the experimental RDFs showed the benefit K-Neighbors classification method.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0927-0256	1879-0801		WOS:000787285000001

However, the strong adsorption of *CO on the Fe-N-4 site embedded in intact graphene limits current density due to slow CO desorption process. Herein, we report how the manipulation of pore edges on graphene alters the local electronic structure of isolated Fe-N-4 sites and improves their intrinsic reactivity for prompting CO generation. We demonstrate that constructing holes on graphene basal plane to support Fe-N-4 can significantly enhance its CO2RR compared to the pore-deficient graphene-supported counterpart, exhibiting a CO Faradaic efficiency of 94% and a turnover frequency of 1630 h(-1) at 0.58 V vs RHE. Mechanistic studies reveal that the incorporation of pore edges results in the downshifting of the d-band center of Fe sites, which weakens the strength of the Fe-C bond when the *CO intermediate adsorbs on edge-hosted Fe-N-4, thus boosting the CO desorption and evolution rates. These findings suggest that engineering local support structure renders a way to design high-performance single-atom catalysts.									69	3	0	0	4	0	69			2155-5435			WOS:000577156300001

Besides, COFs can provide multiple high-rate charge carrier transport (electron, hole, and ion) pathways, including conjugated skeletons, overlapped pi electron clouds among the stacked layers, and open channels with a variable chemical environment. Therefore, they have shown great potential in electrochemical energy storage (EES) and conversion (EEC). However, in bulk COFs, the defects always impede charge carrier conduction, and the difficulties in reaching deep-buried active sites by either electrons or ions lead to limited performance. To overcome these obstacles, numerous research studies have been carried out to obtain COF nanosheets (NSs). This review first describes the preparation strategies of COF NSs via bottom-up and top-down approaches. Then, the applications of bulk COFs and COF NSs in EES and EEC are summarized, such as in batteries, supercapacitors, and fuel cells. Finally, key challenges and future directions in these areas are discussed.									279	23	0	0	18	0	278			0306-0012	1460-4744		WOS:000540575800008	32369058

The cathodic photocurrent for p-type characteristics reversing to anodic photocurrent on a LaFeO3 photoanode is observed under visible light (>420 nm) and the anodic photoelectrochemical water oxidation performance is improved by electro-deposition of amorphous cobalt-phosphate (Co-Pi). It shows that the presence of Co-Pi down-shifts the onset potential by similar to 560 mV for anodic photocurrent, and the improvement can be attributed to enhanced water oxidation due to the Co-II/Co-III-OH discharge in Co-Pi decorated layers by cyclic voltammetry test. The transition anodic photocurrent is improved by about six times after Co-Pi coating under visible light at 0.50 V vs. Ag/AgCl and the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy certifies the enhanced charge transfer, which contributes to the meliorative anodic photocurrent. The suppression of the photogenerated electron-hole recombination after Co-Pi coating on LaFeO3 photoanode is directly demonstrated by the reduced photoluminescence spectrum. Combined with the accelerated carrier consumption on the surface and enhanced carrier separation on the photoanode, the incident photon-to-current conversion efficiencies of LaFeO3 can be promoted from 1.37% to 2.14% at 400 nm owing to the presence of the Co-Pi layer.									32	0	0	0	1	0	32				2046-2069		WOS:000372812300065

For comparison purpose, an iron foil electrode was also used to evaluate the effect of porosity on the yield for Fe(VI) generation. The cyclic voltammograms (CVs) of pure iron pellet revealed a broad anodic wave between -1 and 0.5 V versus Hg/HgO corresponding to iron dissolution and passivation of the electrode. These processes are followed by an irreversible oxidation wave attributed to the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and the generation of ferrate. On the return scan, the cathodic wave at about 0 V versus Hg/HgO is associated with the reduction of electrochemically generated ferrate. The electrochemical generation of ferrate occurred with higher concentration and yield at an iron pellet electrode than at a foil electrode due to the porous structure of the pellet electrode, which favors iron dissolution. However, the electrochemically active thickness of the pellet electrode was estimated to be only about 1% of the actual pellet thickness. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd.

They also have been used in engineering P450s for more cost-effective, NADPH-independent biocatalysis. However, despite their broad application, little is known of the preference of individual P450s for different OSs or the substrate dependence of OS-supported activity. Furthermore, the biocatalytic potential of OSs other than cumene hydroperoxide (CuOOH) and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) is yet to be explored. Here, we investigated the ability of the major human drug-metabolizing P450s, namely CYP3A4, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, and CYP1A2, to use the following OSs: H2O2, tert-butyl hydroperoxide (tert-BuOOH), CuOOH, (diacetox-yiodo)benzene, and bis(trifluoroacetoxy)iodobenzene. Overall, CuOOH and tert-BuOOH were found to be the most effective at supporting these P450s. However, the ability of P450s to be supported by OSs effectively was also found to be highly dependent on the substrate used. This suggests that the choice of OS should be tailored to both the P450 and the substrate under investigation, underscoring the need to employ screening methods that reflect the activity toward the substrate of interest to the end application.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTCytochrome P450 (P450) enzymes can be supported by different oxygen surrogates (OSs), avoiding the need for a redox partner and costly NADPH. However, few data exist comparing relative activity with different OSs and substrates. This study shows that the choice of OS used to support the major drug-metabolizing P450s influences their relative activity and regioselectivity in a substrate-specific fashion and provides a model for the more efficient use of P450s for metabolite biosynthesis.									3	0	0	0	1	0	3			0090-9556	1521-009X		WOS:000551340100002	32238418

Along with those of subaerial (Makapu'u) Ko'olau olivines (Eiler and others, 1996a), they span the full range of the delta O-18(vsmow) variation previously observed in "Loa-trend" Hawaiian volcanoes (L (o) over bar 'ihi, Mauna Loa, Hualalai, and Ko'olau), vary systematically with the stratigraphic position, and correlate with other geochemical properties of their host lavas (Tanaka and others, 2002; Haskins and Garcia, 2004; Huang and Frey, 2005; Salters and others, 2006; Fekiacova and others, 2007). These observations can be explained if the "Loa-trend" volcanoes (including Ko'olau) are constructed of magmas made by mixing peridotite melt with variable proportions of eclogite melt derived from a mafic constituent of the Hawaiian plume having a composition resembling recent mid-ocean-ridge basalts. We present a model of this magma mixing process that simultaneously explains the correlations among oxygen isotopes, major elements, trace elements and radiogenic isotopes. Although a number of models of this kind, differing in several parameters, describe the data equally well, all statistically acceptable models require an "enriched" component with a MORB-like HREE pattern and enriched oxygen isotope composition (delta O-18(VSMOW) = 7.8-9.7 parts per thousand), consistent with this component being an upper crustal (layer 1 or 2) basalt or gabbro with a low-temperature alteration history, possibly containing a small amount of sediment. Abundances of some minor elements-Ni and Ti-are not well described by this model; we show that these shortcomings are derived from the compositional assumption and operational difficulties, that is, TiO2 content is too high in our assumed eclogite end-member, and the inversion of NiO content in the melt by the olivine addition calculation is imprecise due to the sensitivity of D-NiO(olivine/melt) to the melt composition and to crystallization process. Previous studies have advocated that Hawaiian lavas were derived from partial melts of an olivine-free pyroxenite formed by reaction of eclogite-derived melt with peridotite (for example, Sobolev and others, 2005). Our study shows that the peridotite-derived and eclogite-derived melt-mixing model can explain the geochemistry of Hawaiian lavas as well, including high-Ni Ko'olau olivines. We find that an olivine-free mantle source for Hawaiian lavas is unnecessary, although melt-rock interaction could be important in modifying melt composition. Inverting for mixing proportions and degree of melting, we estimate that the amount of recycled crust in the Hawaiian plume is <24 weight percent. Comparison of the late shield-stage "Loa-trend" (particularly Ko'olau lavas) and "Kea-trend" (particularly Mauna Kea lavas) suggests that the geochemical diversity of Hawaiian lavas is produced by a thermally and chemically-zoned plume.									6	1	0	0	0	0	6			0002-9599	1945-452X		WOS:000286575800001

Combined with programming for calculation and drawing, the three-dimensional stability diagrams of MgO, MgO center dot Al2O3, and Al2O3 in the Fe-Al-Mg-O system were successfully drawn, which can visually explain the meaning of the iso-oxygen contours and the borderlines among different phases. They also offer straight evidence that the borderline method is imperfect. The three-dimensional stability diagrams can visually show more vital details that cannot be illustrated by the iso-oxygen contours. The most significant advantage of three-dimensional stability diagrams is not only judging the most stable phase in the specific component area but also visually showing the transformation trend among the phases from a three-dimensional perspective, especially when the equilibrium surfaces of these phases are relatively close. Besides, an interesting transformation of inclusions in the Fe-Al-Mg-O system was found. When the magnesium content is higher than 0.0065% and the aluminum content is lower than 0.21%, the equilibrium products of aluminum-magnesium composite deoxidation may be transformed from MgO to MgO center dot Al2O3 and Al2O3 in turn, which can be directly observed from the three-dimensional stability diagram based on the calculations.

A basic step is the proton-coupled electron transfer, which enables accumulation of oxidizing equivalents without buildup of a charge. We find that substituting deuterium for hydrogen resulted in an 87% decrease in the catalytic activity for water oxidation on Co-based amorphous-oxide catalysts at neutral pH, while 160-to-180 substitution lead to a 10% decrease. In situ visible and quasi-in situ X-ray absorption spectroscopy reveal that the hydrogen-to-deuterium isotopic substitution induces an equilibrium isotope effect that shifts the oxidation potentials positively by approximately 60 mV for the proton coupled Co-II/III and Co-II/III electron transfer processes. Time resolved spectroelectrochemical measurements indicate the absence of a kinetic isotope effect, implying that the precatalytic proton-coupled electron transfer happens through a stepwise mechanism in which electron transfer is rate-determining. An observed correlation between Co oxidation states and catalytic current for both isotopic conditions indicates that the applied potential has no direct effect on the catalytic rate, which instead depends exponentially on the average Co oxidation state. These combined results provide evidence that neither proton nor electron transfer is involved in the catalytic rate-determining step. We propose a mechanism with an active species composed by two adjacent Cow atoms and a rate-determining step that involves oxygen oxygen bond formation and compare it with models proposed in the literature.									40	1	0	0	5	0	40			0002-7863	1520-5126		WOS:000459642000027	30650965

Pristine Co3O4 was widely studied as efficient photocatalyst, but prefers to produce oxygen due to its lower band-edge positions with regard to water redox potentials. In this work, high efficient photocatalyst basing on non-noble La doped Co3O4 on graphene, i.e., LaxCo3_(x)O4/G, were first reported and prepared by the microwave hydrothermal synthesis. In this newly developed hybrids, La and Co ions were adsorbed on the surface of graphene (G) and subsequently reacted with ammonia to yield the LaxCo3-xO4/G nanohybrid by in-situ chemical deposition methods. The activity for hydrogen generation of the nanohybrid exhibits 2 times higher than undoped Co3O4/G under visible light irradiation. The H-2 evolution of nanohybrid reaches 6.543 mmol g(-1) h(-1) when the molar ratio of La/Co is 10% in the nanohybrid. Our experimental results indicate the incorporation of La doped in the Co3O4 crystal lattice not only forms the lattice defects, resulting in provision for capture trap and the separation of electrons and holes, but also changes the band structure to eventually improve the photocatalytic activity under visible light. Therefore, non-noble La is a promising substitute to prepare highly efficient hydrogen photocatalyst and can be extendedly applied to the other metal oxide semiconductors for solar hydrogen production.

By rationally tuning the cores and the shells in such nanoparticles (NPs), a range of materials with tailorable properties can be produced which are of interest for a wide variety of applications. Herein, experimental and theoretical approaches have been combined to show the structural transformation of NPs resulting to the formation of either NiFexCy encapsulated in ultra-thin graphene layer (NiFe@UTG) or Ni3C/FexCy@FeOx NPs with the universal one-step pulse laser ablation in liquid (PLAL) method. Analysis suggests that carbon in Ni3C is the source for the carbon shell formation, whereas the final carbon-shell thickness in the NPs originates from the difference between Ni3C and FexCy phases stability at room temperature. The ternary Ni-Fe-C phase diagram calculations reveal the competition between carbon solubility in the studied metals (Ni and Fe) and their tendency toward oxidation as the key properties to produce controlled core-shell NP materials. As an application example, the electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution current on the different NPs is measured. The electrochemical analysis of the NPs reveals that NiFe@UTG has the best performance amongst the NPs in this study in both alkaline and acidic media.

In addition to promoting electrocatalytic activity, Cu(II) nanoclusters act as efficient cocatalyts for CO2 photoreduction when grafted onto the surface of a semiconductor (light harvester), such as niobate (Nb3O8) nanosheets. Here, the photocatalytic activity and reaction pathway of Cu(II)-grafted Nb3O8 nanosheets was investigated using electron spin resonance (ESR) analysis and isotope-labeled molecules (H218O and (CO2)-C-13). The results of the labeling experiments demonstrated that under UV irradiation, electrons are extracted from water to produce oxygen (O-18(2)) and then reduce CO2 to produce (CO)-C-13. ESR analysis confirmed that excited holes in the valence band of Nb3O8 nanosheets react with water, and that excited electrons in the conduction band of Nb3O8 nanosheets are injected into the Cu(II) nanoclusters through the interface and are involved in the reduction of CO2 into CO. The Cu(II) nanocluster-grafted Nb3O8 nanosheets are composed of nontoxic and abundant elements and can be facilely synthesized by a wet chemical method. The nanocluster grafting technique described here can be applied for the surface activation of various semiconductor light harvesters, such as metal oxide and/or metal chalcogenides, and is expected to aid in the development of efficient CO2 photoreduction systems.									139	7	0	0	12	0	139			1936-0851	1936-086X		WOS:000349940500107	25629438

Here, we summarize the recent works in screening highly-efficient graphdiyne-ACs (GDY-ACs) with the utilization of density functional theory (DFT) calculations and machine learning (ML). Our studies showed that the Pd, Co, Pt and Hg could form stable zero-valence transition metal-GDY (TM-GDY), whereas the lanthanide-TM DAC (Ln-TM DAC) systems were also demonstrated as the promising electrocatalyst candidates because of their long-range site-to-site -d orbital interactions. The further analysis revealed that the combination of main group elements with TM and Ln metals can achieve high stable GDY-DAC and preserve the high clectroactivity due to the long-range p-orbital coupling, while the role of the s- and p-orbitals was studied via ML algorithm. In addition, the OFT calculation and ML techniques also showed great potential in screening possible GDY-based ACs with excellent hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) performances, and the potential of rare-earth-based GDY-ACs for HER has been predicted for the first lime. This review has supplied an advanced strategy for future exploration of atomic catalyst.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0251-0790			WOS:000819118700003

This work focuses on the effect of multiphase thermal radiation and O-2 dilution in ambient/exhaust gases, sometimes also referred to as exhaust gas recirculation (EGR), qualitatively and quantitatively. The spray-A case (n-dodecane as fuel) from Engine Combustion Network (ECN) is used as the target condition. Two different soot modelling approaches have been considered: a semi-empirical two-equation model and a detailed method of moments with interpolative closure (MOMIC) model. A multiphase photon Monte Carlo (PMC) solver with line-by-line (LBL) spectral data is used to resolve radiative heat transfer. Results show that the effect of radiation on soot is minimal in spray-A. Inclusion of radiation modelling, on the other hand, marginally reduces NO prediction. Both peak soot and NO formation increase with O-2 content in the ambient gas. Oxygen content in ambient gas is also found to have significant effect on soot sizes as the mean soot diameter increases along with considerable widening of the diameter distribution with the increase of O-2 percentage in the ambient gas.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			1364-7830	1741-3559		WOS:000513750700001

Molecular hydrogen, the most abundant molecule, helps the cooling of collapsing clouds and through the study of its transitions, it gives information on the conditions of the ISM (Interstellar Medium) environment it finds itself in. While neutral or ionized, it intervenes in reactions to form most molecules that have been detected in the ISM. Water is the main component of ices coating dust grain; ices are the place of the formation and storage of molecules of biogenic interest. Furthermore, how water interacts with grains is of importance in understanding the delivery of water to planetary bodies. The formation of molecular hydrogen and water occurs largely on dust grains. Here we review the most important experimental discoveries about the formation of molecular hydrogen, and we present new work on the formation of water on ices and on grain analogs.					1st International Conference on Chemical Evolution of Star Forming Region and Origin of Life (Astrochem)1st International Conference on Chemical Evolution of Star Forming Region and Origin of Life (Astrochem)	JUL 10-13, 2012JUL 10-13, 2012	Govt India, Council Sci & Ind ResGovt India, Council Sci & Ind Res	S N Bose Natl Ctr Basic Sci, Kolkata, INDIAS N Bose Natl Ctr Basic Sci, Kolkata, INDIA	2	0	0	0	0	0	2			0094-243X		978-0-7354-1167-8	WOS:000323886500003

EUV radiation (32-48 eV) generated by high-order harmonics was used to ionize and excite CO molecules and a time-delayed infrared (IR) pulse (800 nm) was used to influence the evolution of the dissociating multichannel wave packet. Two groups of states, separable experimentally by their kinetic-energy release (KER), are populated by the EUV and lead to C+-O+ fragmentation: direct double ionization of the neutral molecule and fragmentation of the cation leading to C+-O*, followed by autoionization of O*. The IR pulse was found to modify the KER of the latter group in a delay-dependent way which is explained with a model calculation.									10	1	0	0	0	0	10			1050-2947	1094-1622		WOS:000282677400010

J	Tolvanen, Henrik; Raiko, Risto								An experimental study and numerical modeling of combusting two coal chars in a drop-tube reactor: A comparison between N-2/O-2, CO2/O-2, and N-2/CO2/O-2 atmospheres								FUEL				124				190	201		10.1016/j.fuel.2014.01.103				MAY 15 2014	2014	The purpose of this study was to examine how CO2 affects the burning behavior of two coal chars, char 1 and char 2. The work consisted of experiments and numerical modeling. The experiments were conducted under high heating rates in a laboratory-scale drop-tube reactor (DTR). The char samples were produced by pyrolyzing coal particles in the DTR at 850 degrees C in pure N-2. Before pyrolysis, the coal particles were ground and sieved to a particle size fraction of 100-125 mu m. The mass loss of the char particles was determined after the DTR combustion process. The surface temperature of the char particles was measured with a two-color pyrometer during combustion. The diameter evolution and the falling velocity of the particles were studied optically with a CCD high-speed camera. The oxygen concentrations used in the measurements were 2-12 vol.% in either N-2 or CO2. The combustion was assumed to take place within the Zone I and Zone II regimes. Zone I describes the conditions where the combustion process is controlled by chemical kinetics. In Zone II both chemical kinetics and intraparticle diffusion control the combustion. With char 2 the effect of replacing N-2 gradually with CO2 was also tested. This was done for the purpose of examining the interactions of the oxidation and CO2 gasification reactions. When the N-2 was entirely replaced with CO2 from the reactor atmosphere, the mass loss rate of both chars decreased slightly compared to the N-2 setting. A more drastic decrease was observed in the particle surface temperature. This study also presents the numerical modeling results of combusting the two coal chars in the DTR in N-2/O-2 and CO2/O-2 atmospheres. The apparent chemical kinetic parameters of the oxidation reactions were calculated based on the measurement results in the N-2/O-2 atmosphere. The apparent chemical kinetic parameters of the CO2 gasification reaction were also calculated for char 2. In the modeling calculations the internal heat transfer of the char particles, oxygen diffusion in the boundary layer, Stefan flow, and the size distribution of the particles were taken into consideration. The modeling results indicated the importance of determining the initial size distribution of the sample particles. An average diameter model could not explain the large variation in the measured particle surface temperatures. As a result, a comparison between the modeling results and the measurement results suggested that high CO2 partial pressure in the combustion atmosphere can affect the combustion process in other ways than merely through the differences in the gas properties.

The chemical composition of olivine and coexisting spinel in type II chondrules and Fe-rich isolated olivine grains from the Allende meteorite were analysed with an electron microprobe.The Fe/Mg exchange reaction between olivine and spinel yields upper limits for peak metamorphic temperatures on the Allende parent body of approximately 800 K. This may represent the closure temperature for Fe/Mg interdiffusion in olivine and spinel.Steep Fe/Mg concentration gradients in Allende olivine of various textural settings provide an independent method for estimating peak metamorphic temperatures. Modelling of Fe/Mg interdiffusion in olivine leads to an upper limit of peak metamorphic temperatures between 600 and 750 K, assuming a duration of the thermal event of 10(6) years.The extrapolation of experimentally determined diffusion data to low temperatures and low oxygen fugacities is the major cause for the uncertainties in the calculated equilibration temperatures. A critical evaluation of existing Fe/Mg interdiffusion data and equations proposed for low temperature extrapolation suggests that the lower value of 600 K is more realistic.									50	0	0	0	0	0	50			0016-7037			WOS:A1994MV54400037

For the conversion of nitrogen to ammonia, more energy efficient and environmentally friendly approach is required which can be fulfilled by the electrochemical nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR). Because of its sluggish kinetics and poor selectivity, the progress of NH3 production is far beyond the industrial periphery. So, to meet the current energy demands, here we have summarized the bottlenecks of the NRR and have discussed briefly how to overcome these issues in terms of competitive HER, N-2 solubility in the electrolyte, and material specificity. Among the various categories of catalysts explored for NRR, we are here interested in transition metal borides (Mbenes), carbides (TMCs) and nitrides (TMNs) because of their respective benefits in selective N-2 adsorption and its subsequent reduction. We have widely covered the DFT studies concerning these catalysts and their experimental implementations towards NRR. Along with that, we believe that this review with detailed fundamentals of N-2 reduction will act as a tutorial for new-comers in this field. Finally, with the focus on the current challenges in this field, potential opportunities and future prospective have been provided.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0				2633-5409		WOS:000806908700001

Lithium ion (Li ion) batteries and hydrogen fuel cells provide pure-electrification solutions for different mass and usage segments of automotive application. Battery electric vehicles based on current and targeted Li ion battery technology will be limited to small-vehicle low-mileage-per-day applications; this is due to relatively low specific energy (kWh/kg) and long recharge time constraints. We briefly discuss new generations of Li ion positive and negative electrode intercalation compounds that are needed and under development to achieve energy storage density, durability, and cost targets. Lithium-air batteries give promise of extending the range, but scientists and engineers must surmount a plethora of challenges if growing research investments in this area are to prove effective. Hydrogen fuel cell vehicles have demonstrated the required similar to 300 mile range and the ability to operate in all climates, but the cost of Pt-based catalysts, a low efficiency of utilization of presently cost-effective renewable sources of primary energy (e.g., electricity from wind), and the development of hydrogen infrastructure present significant challenges. Dramatic decreases in the amount of Pt used are required and are being brought to fruition along several lines of development that are described in some detail.									616	21	1	0	20	1	627			1948-7185			WOS:000280021000028

However, the effects of speleothem geometry and drip rate on the speleothem's carbon and oxygen isotopic composition have yet to be investigated. Over more strongly sloping surfaces, solutions are thinner and flow faster. The effects of thinner and faster-flowing solutions on the isotopic composition of carbonate minerals precipitated from these solutions are of opposite sense. Thinner solutions enhance rates of CO2 degassing and mineral formation, increasing the degree of isotopic distillation of the dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) reservoir and leading to larger isotopic fractionation between the carbonate mineral and the initial DIC. Concurrently, faster flow over the steeper surfaces results in shorter residence times of the solutions on the growing speleothem, thereby limiting the degree of isotopic distillation and CaCO3-DIC fractionation. Consequently, predicting the CaCO3-DIC isotopic fractionation as a function of drip rate, surface slope and flow distance is not trivial. Using an advection-diffusion-reaction model, we tested the sensitivity of the isotopic composition of calcite precipitated along inclined surfaces to the solution discharge (drip) rate and the surface slope. Calcite 513C and 518O values correlate well with the degree of prior calcite precipitation (PCP), which is identified as a major determinant of isotopic compositions in speleothems. Our results show that at low PCP, speleothem 513C and 518O values may initially decrease relative to calciteDIC and calcite-water equilibrium due to expression of kinetic isotope effects of mineral precipitation. Upon progressive PCP, 513C and 518O values gradually increase due to continuous CO2(aq) formation and degassing. This shift in the isotopic composition of the calcite to lower-than-equilibrium and then higher-than-equilibrium values expands the regime of nearequilibrium compositions during the isotopic evolution. In turn, this may allow quantitative environmental reconstructions, even when the isotopic system is in disequilibrium. Under the simulated conditions, our model predicts maximal potential enrichments of 7 and 3 parts per thousand in the calcite 513C and 518O values, respectively. In addition, we found a strong dependence of the calcite 513C and 518O values on the drip rate and distance of flow, and a weak dependence on the surface slope. In fact, changes in drip rate alone may drive isotopic offsets of several permil, when all other environmental parameters are kept constant. According to our model, higher drip rates and shorter stalactites promote closer-to-equilibrium isotopic compositions of stalagmites, providing a higher signal-to-noise ratio, and minimizing variability that is unrelated to climate.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			0016-7037	1872-9533		WOS:000744072000001

The accuracy of such a comparison depends on reliable S-33(p, gamma)Cl-34 and S-34(p, gamma)Cl-35 reaction rates at the nova temperature regime. The latter rate has recently been computed based on experimental input, and many new excited states in Cl-35 were discovered above the proton threshold. As a result, the experimental S-34(p, gamma)Cl-35 rate was found to be less uncertain and 2-5 times smaller than the theoretical one. Consequently, the simulated S-34/S-32 isotopic ratio for nova presolar grains was predicted to be smaller than that of type II supernova grains by a factor of 1.5 to 3.7.Purpose: The present study was performed to confirm the existence of these new resonances, and to improve the remaining uncertainties in the S-34(p, gamma)Cl-35 reaction rate.Methods: Energies and spin-parities of the Cl-35 excited levels were investigated via high-resolution charged-particle spectroscopy with an Enge split-pole spectrograph using the S-32(alpha, p)Cl-35 reaction. Differential cross sections of the outgoing protons were measured at E-alpha = 21 MeV. Distorted-wave Born approximation calculations were carried out to constrain the spin-parity assignments of observed levels, with special attention to those significant in determination of the S-34(p, gamma)Cl-35 reaction rate over the nova temperature regime.Results: The existence of these newly discovered states are largely confirmed, although a few states were not observed in this study. The spins and parities of a few Cl-35 states were assigned tentatively for the first time.Conclusions: The present S-34(p, gamma)Cl-35 experimental thermonuclear reaction rate at 0.1-0.4 GK is consistent within 1 sigma with the previous evaluation. However, our rate uncertainty is larger than before due to a more realistic treatment of the uncertainties in the rate input. In comparison with the previous rate evaluation, where the high and low rates differed by less than a factor of 2 over the nova temperature regime, the ratio of the present limit rates is at most a factor of 3.5 at 0.12 GK. At temperatures above 0.2 GK, we recommend the future work to focus on determination of the unknown properties of four excited states of Cl-35: 6643, 6761, 6780, and 6800 keV.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			2469-9985	2469-9993		WOS:000470855100003

In this study, 4-BP was subjected to electrochemical reduction and oxidation using a divided cell with two prepared Pd-Fe/graphene catalytic cathodes and a Ti/IrO2/RuO2 anode. In the cathodic compartment, reduction debromination in the presence of a Pd-Fe/graphene catalyst was processed with adsorbing hydrogen on the cathode. The cathode also generated hydroxyl radicals in aid of the feeding air to promote the oxidative degradation of 4-BP. At 60 min, the removal rate of 4-BP was 100% in the two catholytes and 99.5% in the anolyte. Most of the intermediate products formed during degradation were identified using liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry. The concentration evolution of three aromatic by-products and four carboxylic acids were detected by high-performance liquid chromatography and ion chromatography. Two possible pathways were proposed on the basis of the reduction and oxidation reaction. A kinetics experiment was carried out to evaluate significant degradation steps. A scheme for the complete mineralization of 4-BP was elucidated. Furthermore, the time course of 4-BP and intermediate concentrations satisfactorily correlated with the toxicity profiles determined from the inhibition of Photobacterium phosphoreum luminescence. Two toxicity evaluation methods demonstrated that a large amount of toxic substance (benzoquinone) was produced in the anolyte at 20 min. However, benzoquinone was not detected in the catholytes and the toxicity of the catholytes decreased with electrolysis time. The formation of the carboxylic acids induced a sharp toxicity decrease, thus ensuring overall detoxification.									35	3	0	0	12	0	36			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000417304500050

Observation of a low anodic photocurrent for a C-TiO2 thin film electrode in 0.5 M Na2SO4 (pH = 6.4) under visible light irradiation suggested the occurrence of water oxidation by photogenerated holes in a C-induced midgap level of C-TiO2, though a C-TiO2 particulate suspension system in the presence of an electron acceptor (Fe3+) gave no detectable O-2 evolution under the visible light irradiation. The photocurrent measurements also showed that the holes in the midgap level of C-TiO2 were able to oxidize efficiently methanol and formic acid. Interestingly, the oxidation of methanol was explained reasonably by a mechanism that it proceeded indirectly via a surface intermediate of the water oxidation such as Ti-O center dot, in harmony with the abovementioned assumption of the water photooxidation by the midgap-level holes, whereas the oxidation of formic acid was interpreted to occur by a direct reaction of the midgap-level holes. On the other hand, the holes generated in the O2p valence band by the UV irradiation caused the oxidation of both methanol and formic acid via the direct mechanism. All the experimental results were thus explained on the basis of a recently reported new mechanism for the water photooxidation on TiO2 that it was initiated by a nucleophilic attack of a water molecule (Lewis base) on a surface-trapped hole (Lewis acid).									82	4	0	0	4	0	84			1932-7447	1932-7455		WOS:000247215200031

Here, IrO2-modified PdO-nanostructures/carbon-composite with plenty of surface defects was synthesized for HER/HOR applications. The ECSA of IrO2-PdO/C is found to be 449 m g(-1) which is similar to 9-fold higher than Pt/C in acid. The HER of IrO2-PdO/C are 1.15-and 2.35-fold higher than Pt/C in acid and base. The stability test shows excellent stability of this catalyst. It also shows superior HOR activity. The i0,m of IrO2-PdO/C is similar to 647 and 376 mA/mgmetal in acid and base that are 1.78-and 3.63-times higher in compared to commercial Pt/C. Small amount of IrO2 in IrO2-PdO/C en-hances its HOR/HER activity similar to 300 times as compared to PdO/C. The IrO2 or defects of the catalyst absorb OHad that reacts with neighboring Had at defect sites or interfaces leading to increase HER/HOR per-formance through bifunctional mechanism. We demonstrate volcano relationship between exchange current and H*/OH* binding energy confirming that HBE and OHBE are equal descriptors for HOR/HER in base. The HOR/HER in different electrolyte and increasing Li thorn ions suggests [(H2O)x-M thorn -OHad ] in double layer influences the HOR/HER in base. This work could lead to the development of Pt-free electrocatalysts for renewable energy technologies. (c) 2022 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Ettinger, WF; Clear, AM; Fanning, KJ; Peck, ML								Identification of a Ca2+/H+ antiport in the plant chloroplast thylakoid membrane								PLANT PHYSIOLOGY				119	4			1379	1385		10.1104/pp.119.4.1379				APR 1999	1999	To assess the availability of Ca2+ in the lumen of the thylakoid membrane that is required to support the assembly of the oxygen-evolving complex of photosystem II, we have investigated the mechanism of Ca-45(2+) transport into the lumen of pea (Pisum sativum) thylakoid membranes using silicone-oil centrifugation. Transthylakoid Ca2+ transport is dependent on light or, in the dark, on exogenously added ATP. Both light and ATP hydrolysis are coupled to Ca2+ transport through the formation of a transthylakoid pH gradient. The H+-transporting ionophores nigericin/K+ and carbonyl cyanide 3-chlorophenylhydrazone inhibit the transport of Ca2+. Thylakoid membranes are capable of accumulating up to 30 nmol Ca2+ mg(-1) chlorophyll from external concentrations of 15 mu M over the course of a 15-min reaction. These results are consistent with the presence of an active Ca2+/H+ antiport in the thylakoid membrane. Ca2+ transport across the thylakoid membrane has significant implications for chloroplast and plant Ca2+ homeostasis. We propose a model of chloroplast Ca2+ regulation whereby the activity of the Ca2+/H+ antiporter facilitates the light-dependent uptake of Ca2+ by chloroplasts and reduces stromal Ca2+ levels.									114	13	5	0	109	1	127			0032-0889	1532-2548		WOS:000079737900025	10198097	
J	Wilson, David F.; Matschinsky, Franz M.								Metabolic Homeostasis in Life as We Know It: Its Origin and Thermodynamic Basis								FRONTIERS IN PHYSIOLOGY				12						658997	10.3389/fphys.2021.658997				APR 23 2021	2021	Living organisms require continuous input of energy for their existence. As a result, life as we know it is based on metabolic processes that extract energy from the environment and make it available to support life (energy metabolism). This metabolism is based on, and regulated by, the underlying thermodynamics. This is important because thermodynamic parameters are stable whereas kinetic parameters are highly variable. Thermodynamic control of metabolism is exerted through near equilibrium reactions that determine. (1) the concentrations of metabolic substrates for enzymes that catalyze irreversible steps and (2) the concentrations of small molecules (AMP, ADP, etc.) that regulate the activity of irreversible reactions in metabolic pathways. The result is a robust homeostatic set point (-Delta G(ATP)) with long term (virtually unlimited) stability. The rest of metabolism and its regulation is constrained to maintain this set point. Thermodynamic control is illustrated using the ATP producing part of glycolysis, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate oxidation to pyruvate. Flux through the irreversible reaction, pyruvate kinase (PK), is primarily determined by the rate of ATP consumption. Change in the rate of ATP consumption causes mismatch between use and production of ATP. The resulting change in [ATP]/[ADP][Pi], through near equilibrium of the reactions preceding PK, alters the concentrations of ADP and phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP), the substrates for PK. The changes in ADP and PEP alter flux through PK appropriately for restoring equality of ATP production and consumption. These reactions appeared in the very earliest lifeforms and are hypothesized to have established the set point for energy metabolism. As evolution included more metabolic functions, additional layers of control were needed to integrate new functions into existing metabolism without changing the homeostatic set point. Addition of gluconeogenesis, for example, resulted in added regulation to PK activity to prevent futile cycling; PK needs to be turned off during gluconeogenesis because flux through the enzyme would waste energy (ATP), subtracting from net glucose synthesis and decreasing overall efficiency.									6	1	0	0	1	0	7			1664-042X			WOS:000648092000001	33967829

A critical problem in commercializing rechargeable zinc-air batteries is finding a suitable bifunctional catalyst, in which the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) can work consistently over a long period. Therefore, a zinc-air battery with a tri-electrode configuration is a solution. Nevertheless, antileakage performance is critical for commercial batteries. We report a highcapacity prismatic zinc-air battery using a novel tri-electrode configuration. We introduce a design assuring a better connection between the cathode current collector and tab and a better sealing configuration for antileakage. Four highlights of this work are as follows: (1) excellent discharge performance, (2) antileakage, (3) high capacity, and (4) novel structure. When the cell was loaded with small amounts of zinc gel, it showed a low voltage of 1.10 V when discharging because the small amount of zinc gel might not cover the current collector and separator completely. However, leakage after discharge was observed when the cell was loaded with excess zinc gel. The amount of zinc gel, while being antileakage, was optimized by filling the anode case cavity with a proper amount of zinc gel, i. e., 87%. When the cell was discharged under a high current, it incurred a low voltage problem. However, discharging under a low current took long, and the surrounding carbon dioxide can seriously deteriorate the cathode catalyst's performance. Consequently, an optimal zinc loading as high as 97% in the zinc gel was used in an effective current discharge process. Moreover, the cell showed low voltage in a highly humid environment because of the high humidity affecting the active sites for the three-phase reaction. Notably, no leakage was detected even after the extreme conditioning test, i.e., the high-low temperature cycle test (70 ℃ to -20 ℃) and high-temperature storage (45 ℃) for one month test. The tests demonstrated excellent antileakage performance of our cells compared to other commercial zinc-air batteries. An impressively high capacity of 356 A·h/kg was obtained for a single Cell-14 under a 600 mA discharge current, whereas batteries packed with the Cell-14 connected in series and parallel possessed a high energy density of 405 W·h/kg. Also, our optimized design strategies (the larger size anode cavity design, optimized zinc gel recipe, and improved catalyst performance) could theoretically be used to design a cell to obtain an energy density as high as 650 W·h/kg. The novel structure of a double-layered air cathode with tri-electrode configuration increases the effective air catalytic area, doubling the power density. Ultimately, our novel zinc-air battery with a unique trielectrode structure, combined with gel polymer electrolytes, can be used to develop and commercialize a rechargeable zinc-air battery in the future.			锌空气电池具有高安全、大容量、低成本和低自放电等特性,因此获得广泛关注。可充电式锌空气电池在商业化过程中最重要的问题在于难以找到合适的双功能催化剂同时长时间实现氧还原反应(ORR)和析氧反应(OER),而三电极电池结构是一个有效解决此问题的方案。另外,大容量方形锌空气电池在商品化过程中的耐漏液性能极其重要。本文报道了一种可商业化的大容量三电极方形锌空气一次电池,该电池具4大创新特点:①放电性能优异,在合适的电流放电情况下锌粉利用率高达97.0%;②高耐漏液性能,其耐漏液性能比市面上的方形锌空气电池更好,经过高低温测试以及高温45 ℃储存1个月测试不会出现漏液现象;③比容量大,单电芯比容量可达356 A·h/kg,由此串并联而成的电池包放电能量密度达到405 W·h/kg;④结构新颖,采用双面ORR空气极的锌空气电池结构可大幅度增加空气催化有效面积,提高电池的放电功率,此外,其中一面ORR空气极未来可切换为OER空气极,电池变为三电极结构有助于推动可充式锌空气电池的发展。						0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2095-4239			CSCD:7143495

Herein, a ZnTe/ZnO heterostructured material supported on N-doped carbon nanosheets (ZnTe/ ZnO@C) is prepared with a novel ZnTe metal-organic framework (MOF). The hybrid material exhibits greatly enhanced performances for CO2 reduction to formate with a sustained current density of 16 mA cm-2 and a selectivity of 86% at -1.1 V vs reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) in bicarbonate solutions. The observation of Te-promoted CO2 reduction to formate, with high activity and selectivity, is notable in contrast to other Zn-based that selective formate formation is promoted by the stabilization of the key HCOO* intermediate on ZnTe. Additionally, ZnTe/ ZnO@C is also an excellent catalyst for oxygen evolution owing to its high electrical conductivity and the high degree of covalency in ZnTe. The bifunctionality of ZnTe/ZnO@C toward both reactions is demonstrated by assembling a two-electrode electrochemical cell for CO2/H2O splitting and a fascinating rechargeable Zn-CO2 battery. The latter, when constructed with ZnTe/ZnO@C as the cathode and Zn foil as the anode, yields a Zn-CO2 battery fully based on Zn-based materials.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0897-4756	1520-5002		WOS:000819950800001		
J	De Sousa, Alejandro; Martinez, Yris; Hernandez, Ricardo; Rojas, Carlos; Keymar, Useche								Effect exerted by partial pressures of hydrogen on the faradaic efficiency, in the electrochemical reduction of carbon dioxide. Part A								CIENCIA E INGENIERIA				43	2			221	232						APR-JUL 2022	2022	The hydrogen discharge is a competitive reaction in the electrochemical reduction of carbon dioxide in aqueous or acidic media. Thus in order to try to inhibit it. In this paper, we report the influence of partial pressures CO2/H-2 on the electrochemical reduction of carbon dioxide based on the principle of Le Chatelier. The voltamefric studies at atmospheric pressure indicate that the arrangement of the electrodes is of utmost importance when gaseous products are obtained, as they block the surface leading a loss of the effective area of the elecfrode. Moreover, voltamefric studies in the presence and absence of carbon dioxide suggest the radical anion surface formation at -1.8 V vs. Ag/AgCl KCl sat. Voltamefric and electrolysis studies at high pressure for sulphate buffer systems [H2SO4/K2SO4 pH=2], showed that the glassy carbon elecfrode in the sulphate buffer under 20 atm. of carbon dioxide and at -1.8 V, generated HCOOH as the only product of carbon dioxide electroreduction with a faradaic efficiency of 1.8%. Finally, it was found that the various hydrogen partial pressures applied did not exert a significant effect on the faradaic efficiency on the HCOOH production, or the charge consumed in the process.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1316-7081	2244-8780		WOS:000782485400011

In this composite system, the rGO acting as an electron transfer and the CNF acting as a hole sink, this dual charge transfer channel can maximize the charge carrier separation efficiency, meanwhile, the as obtained alpha-FeOOH/CNF/rGO aerogel has shown great enhanced water affinity-superhydrophilicity, which can sufficiently enhance the mass transportation during photocatalysis activity, the simultaneously enhancement of interfacial charge/mass transportation has endowed this photocatalytic system with both excellent photocatalytic oxidation and reduction performance. Under visible light irradiation, alpha-FeOOH/CNF/rGO can realize efficient degradation of various organics including dyes, aromatic compounds and antibiotics, killing bacterial as well as reduction of heavy metal ion. The simple, low-cost and environmentally friendly fabrication method along with excellent performance of this catalyst indicate its great application prospect for environmental protection.									5	0	0	0	1	0	5			1383-5866	1873-3794		WOS:000565595500001

In order to promote selectivity toward hydrocarbons and alcohols, most notably, the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) should be suppressed. To achieve this goal, we studied intermetallic compounds consisting of transition metal (TM) elements that can reduce CO (Ru, Co, Rh, Ir, Ni, Pd, Pt, and Cu) separated by TM and post transition metal elements (Ag, Au, Cd, Zn, Hg, In, Sn, Pb, Sb, and Bi) that are very poor HER catalysts. In total, 34 different stable binary bulk alloys forming from these elements have been investigated using density functional theory calculations. The electronic and geometric properties of the catalyst surface can be tuned by varying the size of the active centers and the elements forming them. We have identified six different potentially selective intermetallic surfaces on which CO can be reduced to methanol at potentials comparable to or even slightly positive than those for CO/CO2 reduction to methane on Cu. Common features shared by most of the selective alloys are single TM sites. The role of single sites is to block parasitic HER and thereby promote CO reduction.									74	7	0	0	2	0	75			2155-5435			WOS:000338693100022

However, most of the efficient photocatalysts developed till date, works primarily on ultra-violate range of light. To develop photocatalysts that can decompose water under more abundant visible range of light, efforts have already been made by researchers who basically tried to synthesize materials which have such a narrow band gap that they can utilize less energetic photons in visible range. To do so, the catalysts that they have prepared to exhibit high stability and to give decent reaction rate and quantum efficiency are of extremely complex structure. Moreover, cumbersome synthesis route involving doping of different materials, complicated core-shell nanostructure preparation, etc is necessary in most of the cases. Here, we report a facile and efficient approach to facilitate photocatalytic water-splitting under visible light, in single step. We have modified Cu2O, a well-known p-type semiconductor having a hand-gap similar to 2.1 eV, with RuO2 nanoparticles and used it as photocatalyst. We have observed that it has a possibility of near-stoichiometric overall water decomposition under visible light with appreciable quantum efficiency. (c) 2014 Alakananda Mukherjee.

This method has allowed to obtain, for the first time, tetragonal nickel manganite spinels NixMn3-xO4, in the composition range 0.6 less-than-or-equal-to x less-than-or-equal-to 1.0. This phase has been prepared by heating at 200-degrees-C gels obtained by addition of 1M n-butylamine to mixed Ni2+ and Mn2+ solutions. In this paper, we report about the results obtained from X-ray studies, of the thermal evolution and reactivity for the tetragonal spinel with x = 0.8, between 200-degrees to 1000-degrees-C. The formation of a metastable gamma-cation deficient cubic spinel is attained at 300-degrees-C; it decomposes at almost-equal-to 500-degrees-C, giving at 600-degrees-C a mixture of NiMnO3 and a-Mn2O3. Above 800-degrees-C, the reaction between these two phases leads to the formation of the high temperature cubic spinel, in which (Mn4+/Mn3+)B almost-equal-to 1.0. Cell lattice and oxygen positional parameters have been determined from Rietveld refinements. From these data, ionic configuration and cation distribution formulae for cubic spinels have been derived. These results can account for the mechanism of transformations that takes place during the thermal treatments.									26	0	0	0	0	0	26			0025-5408			WOS:A1994PR89700006

To overcome this problem, S-scheme composites have been developed to fabricate photocatalysts. Herein, a novel S-scheme Sb2WO6/g-C3N4 nanocomposite was fabricated by an ultrasound-assisted method, which exhibited excellent performance for photocatalytic ppb-level NO removal. Compared with the pure constituents of the nanocomposite, the as-prepared 15%-Sb2WO6/g-C3N4 photocatalyst could remove more than 68% continuous-flowing NO (initial concentration: 400 ppb) under visible-light irradiation in 30 min. The findings of the trapping experiments confirmed that center dot O-2(-) and h(+) were the important active species in the NO oxidation reaction. Meanwhile, the transient photocurrent response and PL spectroscopy analyses proved that the unique S-scheme structure of the samples could enhance the charge separation efficiency. In situ DRIFTS revealed that the photocatalytic reaction pathway of NO removal over the Sb2WO6/g-C3N4 nanocomposite occurred via an oxygen-induced route. The present work proposes a new concept for fabricating efficient photocatalysts for photocatalytic ppb-level NO oxidation and provides deeper insights into the mechanism of photocatalytic NO oxidation.

Using immunochemical techniques we show that myoglobin is not expressed in the heart ventricles of Cyclop terus lumpus (Cyclopteridae), Anarhichas lupus (Anarhichadidae), Macrozoarces americanus (Zoarcidae), and Lophius americanus (Lophiidae). Hemitripterus americanus (Hemitripteridae) expresses myoglobin at 2.3 +/- 0.2 mg.g wet mass(-1) (mean +/- SD). Myoglobin was not detected in oxidative skeletal muscle (pectoral adductor profundus) in either the white-hearted fishes examined or red-hearted H. americanus. Supporting these results, myoglobin messenger RNA was not detected in cardiac muscles of white-hearted fishes by means of either direct Northern blot analysis or by the reverse transcriptase - polymerase chain reaction followed by amplification of cDNA product. The partial cDNA sequence of H. americanus myoglobin was determined and shows 86.9% identity with a known teleost myoglobin cDNA from Chionodraco rastrospinosus. The 3' untranslated region of H. americanus is 255 nucleotides longer than the 3' untranslated region of C. rastrospinosus. Comparisons of the deduced amino acid sequence of H. americanus with those of other teleosts show 66.2% sequence identity with Cyprinus carpio, 74.6% with Scomber japonicus, and 80.3% with Thunnus albacares and C. rastrospinosus.									9	0	0	0	8	0	9			0008-4301			WOS:000176419200012

In a previous work, we evolved BphAELB400 and obtained BphAE(RR41). This variant metabolizes dibenzofuran and 2-chlorodibenzofuran more efficiently than BphAE(LB400). However, the regiospecificity of BphAE(RR41) toward these substrates differs. Dibenzofuran is metabolized principally through a lateral dioxygenation whereas 2-chlorodibenzofuran is metabolized principally through an angular dioxygenation. In order to explain this difference, we examined the crystal structures of both substrate-bound forms of BphAE(RR41) obtained under anaerobic conditions. This structure analysis, in combination with biochemical data for a Ser283Gly mutant provided evidences that the substrate is compelled to move after oxygen-binding in BphAE(RR41):dibenzofuran. In BphAE(RR41):2-chlorodibenzofuran, the chlorine atom is close to the side chain of Ser283. This contact is missing in the B2hAE(RR41):dibenzofuran, and strong enough in the BphAE(RR41):2-chlorodibenzofuran to help prevent substrate movement during the catalytic reaction.

Repetitive mass spectrometric measurement of the isotopic distribution of O-2 formed in reactions catalyzed by O-18-labeled catalyst established the existence of two reaction pathways characterized by products containing either one atom each from a ruthenyl O and solvent H2O or both O atoms from solvent molecules. The apparent activation parameters for mu-oxo ion-catalyzed water oxidation by Ce4+ and for {5,5} decay were nearly identical, with DeltaH(double dagger) = 7.6 (+/-1.2) kcal/mol, DeltaS(double dagger) = -43 (+/-4) cal/deg mol (23 degreesC) and DeltaH(double dagger) = 7.9 (+/-1.1) kcal/mol, DeltaS(double dagger) = -44 (+/-4) cal/deg mol, respectively, in 0.5 M CF3SO3H. An apparent solvent deuterium kinetic isotope effect (KIE) of 1.7 was measured for O-2 evolution at 23 degreesC; the corresponding KIE for {5,5} decay was 1.6. The O-32(2) /O-34(2) isotope distribution was also insensitive to solvent deuteration. On the basis of these results and previously established chemical properties of this class of compounds, mechanisms are proposed that feature as critical reaction steps H2O addition to the complex to form covalent hydrates. For the first pathway, the elements of H2O are added as OH and H to the adjacent terminal ruthenyl O atoms, and for the second pathway, OH is added to a bipyridine ring and H is added to one of the ruthenyl O atoms.									124	1	0	0	20	0	124			0002-7863			WOS:000223110100071	15291582

The electrocatalysts are thoroughly studied with X-ray diffraction, field emission scanning electron microscope, transmission electron microscopy, nitrogen adsorption-desorption isotherms, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, respectively, and electrochemical method. The time of KOH activation heat treatment is found to yield a considerable effect on crystallinity, microstructure, chemical surface states, the total content of nitrogen and the active nitrogen configurations in all samples. The resulting N-CNFs-3.0 h catalyst shows remarkable advantages for ORR performance, including porous microstructures, high specific surface area, abundant exposed active sites and high content of ORR-active pyridinic-N. With these favorable features, N-CNFs-3.0 h exhibits an overall distinguished ORR performance in alkaline media compared to commercial 20 wt% Pt/C catalyst, which has a high onset potential of 0.9 V (vs. RHE), half-wave potential of 0.83 V (vs. RHE) and electron transfer number (3.93). The superior ORR of N-CNFs-3.0 h mainly originates from the synergistic effect of porous microstructures and high ORR-active pyridinic-N content, which could be optimized by changing KOH activation time. This work presents a facile strategy to controllably design and fabricate highly active ORR metal-free carbon-based electrocatalysts.									7	0	0	0	0	0	7			0022-2461	1573-4803		WOS:000534989700005

However, gas-generating catalysis remains difficult to investigate at the single-nanoparticle level because product gases, such as H-2 and O-2, are difficult to detect on an individual nanoparticle. Here, we successfully find that nanobubbles can be used to study the gas-generating catalysis, i.e., H-2 generation from formic acid dehydrogenation on a single Pd-Ag nanoplate, with a high time resolution (50 ms) via dark-field microscopy. The research reveals that the nanobubble evolution process includes nucleation time and lifetime. The nucleation rate of nanobubbles is proportional to the catalytic activity of a single nanocatalyst. The relationship between the catalytic activity and the nucleation rate is quantitatively described by a mathematical model, which shows that an onset reaction rate (r(onset)) exists for the generation of nanobubbles on a single Pd-Ag nanoplate. The research also reveals that a Pd-Ag nanoplate with larger size usually has a higher activity. However, some large-sized ones still have low activities, indicating the size of the Pd-Ag nanoplate is not the only key factor for the activity. Notablely, further research shows that Pd content is the key factor for the activity of single Pd-Ag nanoplates with similar size. The methodology and knowledge acquired from this research are also applicable to other important gas-generating catalysis reactions at the single-nanoparticle level.									52	5	0	0	8	0	55			0002-7863			WOS:000413057100050	28886624

In this study, a cathode material consisting of alpha-Fe2O3 nanoseeds and carbon nanotubes (CNT) is presented, which achieves excellent cycling stability on deep (dis)charge with high capacity. The initial capacity of Fe2O3/CNT electrode reaches 805 mA h g(-1) (0.7 mA h cm(-2)) at 0.2 mA cm(-2), while maintaining a capacity of 1098 mA h g(-1) (0.95 mA h cm(-2)) after 50 cycles. The operando structural, spectroscopic, and morphological analysis on the evolution of Li2O2 indicates preferential Li2O2 growth on the Fe2O3. The similar d-spacing of the (100) Li2O2 and (104) Fe2O3 planes suggest that the latter epitaxially induces Li2O2 nucleation. This results in larger Li2O2 primary crystallites and smaller secondary particles compared to that deposited on CNT, which enhances the reversibility of the Li2O2 formation and leads to more stable interfaces within the electrode. The mechanistic insights into dual-functional materials that act both as stable host substrates and promote redox reactions in Li-O-2 batteries represent new opportunities for optimizing the discharge product morphology, leading to high cycling stability and coulombic efficiency.									42	1	0	0	1	0	42			1614-6832	1614-6840		WOS:000436103300014

Herein, we excogitate a novel and facile means, via electrochemical activation, to successfully load the amorphous CoOOH layer architecture onto the surface of TiO2. Intriguingly, the as-obtained 6% CoOOH-TiO2 photoelectrode manifests optimal PEC performance with a high photocurrent density of 1.3 mA/cm(2), 3.5 times higher than that of pristine TiO2. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), Tafel analysis and cyclic voltammetry (CV) methods show that the carrier transfer barrier within the electrode and the transition of Co3+OOH to Co4+OOH have the dominating effects on the PEC performance. Theoretical calculation reveals that the interface between the CoOOH and TiO2 improves the homogeneity of effective d-orbital electronic-transfer ability among Co sites. This research sheds light on the water oxidation reaction and the design of more favorable PEC co-catalysts.

They have not been extensively studied, perhaps because they appear simple in outcrop. Recent work has demonstrated the significance of paleo-reaction fronts to decipher multiphase recrystallization processes and provide high porosity zones. This paper provides a detailed documentation of reaction front evolution in a tectonically active salt basin and reveals a high level of complexity, associated with multiple fluid flow and tectonic events. Here, consistent patterns of increasing dolomite stoichiometry and ordering, along with a change from seawater-derived, fabric-retentive dolomite to fracture-controlled, fabric-destructive hydrothermal dolomite are observed vertically across the stratabound dolomite bodies. These patterns, coupled with a decrease in porosity, increase in increment (47) temperature and delta O-18(water) values indicate multiphase recrystallization and stabilization by warm, Mg-rich fluids. The stratabound dolomite bodies apparently terminated at a fracture-bound contact, but the presence of dolomite fragments within the fracture corridor suggests that fracturing post-dated the first dolomitization event. The termination of dolomite formation is therefore interpreted to be associated with a decrease in the capacity of the magnesium-rich fluids to dolomitize the rock, as indicated by the presence of non-stoichiometric and poorly ordered dolomite at the reaction fronts. The fracture corridors are interpreted to exploit dolostone-limestone boundaries, forming prior to a later, higher temperature, hydrothermal dolomitization event, which coincided with the formation and growth of the anticline. Karstification subsequently exploited these fracture corridors, widening fractures and leading to localized collapse and brecciation. The results demonstrate that an apparently simple reaction front can have a complex history, governed by the inheritance of prior diagenetic events. These events modified rock properties in such a way that fluid flow was repeatedly focused along the original dolomite-limestone boundary, overprinting much of its original signature. These findings have implications to the prediction of structurally controlled diagenetic processes and the exploration of naturally fractured carbonate reservoirs for energy exploration globally.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2045-2322			WOS:000805846400030	35661773

Wire materials including Hf, Nb, Ta, Mo, W, Rh, Re, Ir, Pd, and Pt were tested. The filament temperature was varied in the range of 400-2000 degrees C and pressures between 1.0-1.5 bar. Products were characterised by bulk elemental analysis and a laser granulometer. The powders were investigated by TG-DSC-MS under inert, O-2, and H2O containing atmosphere, respectively, in a temperature range of 20-700 degrees C. Hydrogen evolution occurred in three separate steps, depending on the applied gas atmosphere. The oxidation mechanism was explored by the characteristic OxSi-H bands (x = 0-3) observed in ex situ DRIFT experiments. The oxidation of hydrogen terminated silicon surfaces was investigated employing oxygen (O-2), hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), permanganate (MnO4-), or peroxodisulfate (S2O82-) in a temperature range of 0 -120 degrees C. The oxidation was stepwise and strongly enhanced after pretreatment by alkyl lithium salts or Grignard reagents.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			1876-990X	1876-9918		WOS:000345752200005

However, in this case, mass diffusion issues are brought in when some of the pores are covered by the flow field lands or shoulders. The coverage of the pores can lead to very high transport resistance, which may reduce the number of active oxygen evolution reaction sites, and therefore lower down the PEMEC performance. The in-plane transport enhancement layer for TT-LGDLs/PTLs are proposed to develop a dual-layer LGDL/PTL structure for improving the mass diffusion and the PEMEC performance. The results of this research reveal that the dual-layer LGDL/PTL structure exhibits smaller ohmic resistance and mass transport resistance, and therefore improve the PEMEC performance, without obvious changes in kinetic losses. The total ohmic resistance and mass transport resistance can be reduced by about 23% and 41%, respectively, with an similar to 830 mu m pore TT-LGDL/PTL stacking on a similar to 100 mu m pore TT-LGDL/PTL. The results indicate the feasibility of stacking the in-plane transport enhancement layer with large pore sizes onto a small pore TT-LGDLs/PTLs for high efficiency and low cost PEMEC practical applications.

Herein, a novel multilayered SnO2/PPy/beta-PbO2 structure on TiO2 nanotube arrays (TNAs/SnO2/PPy/beta-PbO2) was synthesized by a multi-step electrodeposition process as an efficient electrocatalyst for As (III) oxidation in aqueous solution. Such TNAs/SnO2/PPy/beta-PbO2 electrode exhibited a higher charge transfer, tolerable stability, and high oxygen evolution potential (OEP). The intriguing structure with a SnO2, PPy, and beta-PbO2 active layers provided a larger electrochemical active area for electrocatalytic As(III) oxidation. The assynthesized TNAs/SnO2/PPy/beta-PbO2 anode achieved drastically enhanced As(III) conversion efficiency of 90.72% compared to that of TNAs/beta-PbO2 at circa 45.4%. The active species involved in the electrocatalytic oxidation process included superoxide radical (center dot O-2(-)), sulfuric acid root radicals (center dot SO4-), and hydroxyl radicals (center dot OH). This work offers a new strategy to construct a high-efficiency electrode to meet the requirements of favorable electrocatalytic oxidation properties, good stability, and high electrocatalytic activity for As(III) transformation to As(V).									6	0	0	0	2	0	6			0304-3894	1873-3336		WOS:000762526600001	35176698

Ammonia-oxidizing bacteria and nitrite-oxidizing bacteria were detected by florescent in situ hybridization, polymerase chain reaction, phylogenetic analysis, real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Pyrosequencing was also used in profiling the ammonia monooxygenase locus of ammonia-oxidizing bacteria community. It was found that the dominant ammonia-oxidizing bacteria sequences were related to uncultured ammonia-oxidizing bacterium, uncultured Nitrosomonadaceae bacterium, Nitrosomonas sp., and uncultured bacterium. In addition, Nitrobacter clones were related to uncultured alpha proteobacterium, uncultured bacterium, uncultured Nitrobacter sp., and uncultured Bradyrhizobium sp., whereas Nitrospira clones were similar to uncultured bacterium, Candidatus Nitrospira defluvii, uncultured Nitrospira sp., and uncultured Nitrospirae bacterium. The ammonia-oxidizing bacteria and nitrite-oxidizing bacteria ranged 2.83 x 10(8)-1.33 x 10(10) and 1.25 x 10(10)-1.13 x 10(11) copies L-1, respectively, equivalent to nitrite-oxidizing bacteria: ammonia-oxidizing bacteria ratio of 10:1. The first three parts of the principal components analysis accounted for 76.8% of the explained variance. The first principal component (44.4%) designated that ammonia-oxidizing bacteria and Nitrospira were mainly influenced by seasonal variations, followed by chemical oxygen demand concentration and nitrogen species (i.e., ammonia, nitrite, and nitrate). The second principal component (19.1%) showed no information about the nitrifiers' interaction with environmental factors, whereas Nitrobacter demonstrated a high correlation with ammonia on the third principal component (13.3%). These results revealed that the species of Nitrobacter were less influenced by environmental conditions than ammonia-oxidizing bacteria and Nitrospira spp.									10	1	0	0	8	0	11			1735-1472	1735-2630		WOS:000435131600009

The inhibition is due to oxidation of the uncouplers on the Photosystem II donor side (ADRY effect) and their subsequent reduction on the acceptor side, ie. to the formation of a cyclic electron transfer chain around Photosystem II involving the uncouplers as redox carriers. The relative amplitude of nanosecond chlorophyll fluorescence in chloroplasts was increased by DCMU or HQNO and did not change upon addition of uncouplers, DBMIB or DNP-INT; the HQNO effect was not removed by the uncouplers. The uncouplers did not inhibit the electron transfer from reduced TMPD or duroquinol to methylviologen which is driven by Photosystem I. These data show that CCCP, PCP and TTFB oxidized on the Photosystem II donor side are reduced by the membrane pool of plastoquinone (Q(p)) which is also the electron donor for K-3 [Fe(CN)(6)] in the Hill reaction as deduced from the data obtained in the presence of inhibitors. Inhibition of the Hill reaction by the uncouplers was maximum at the pH values corresponding to the pK of these compounds. It is suggested that the tested uncouplers serve as proton donors, and not merely as electron donors on the oxidizing side of Photosystem II.									16	0	1	0	13	0	17			0166-8595			WOS:A1995UB05000009	24301640

The membranes contained PS I and II complexes at a 1.8:1 molar ratio on the basis of the spin densities on the tyrosine D radical and the photo-oxidized PS I primary donor (P740(+)). In the presence of ferricyanide, laser excitation induced bleach at 725 nm that recovered with time constants of 25,us and 1.2 ms. The signal, designated P725, was suppressed by PS II inhibitors DCMU and hydroxylamine. The P725 spectrum was tentatively assigned to the absorption changes of the special pair Chl d, the accessory Chl d, and the acceptor pheophytin a in PS II. The addition of ascorbate induced the additional signal with a slow decay time constant of 4.5 ms. This signal showed a broad bleach at 740 nm and shift-type absorption changes at around 707 and 685 nm, which were assigned to the absorption changes of PS I special pair of Chl d (P740), the accessory Chl d, and the primary acceptor Chl a (A(0)), respectively. Mechanisms and the evolution of the Chl-d based reaction centers using far-red light are discussed together with the amino acid sequences of PS II D1 and D2 proteins.									49	1	0	0	42	1	50			0006-2960			WOS:000250379900047	17918957

In the study reported here, N-terminal His-tags were added to the plastome-encoded alpha-subunit of cytochrome b(559). PsbE, in tobacco plants, thus facilitating rapid, mild purification of higher plant PSII. Biolistic chloroplast transformation was used to replace the wildtype psbE gene by His-tagged counterparts. Transgenic plants did not exhibit an obvious phenotype. However, the oxygen evolution capacity of thylakoids prepared from the mutants compared to the wildtype was reduced by 10-30% depending on the length of the His-tag, although Fv/Fm values differed only slightly. Homoplasmic F1 plants were used to isolate PSII cores complexes. The cores contained no detectable traces of LHC or PsaA/B polypeptides, but the main core subunits of PSII could be identified using immunodetection and mass spectroscopy. In addition, Psb27 and PsbS were detected. The presence of the former was presumably due to the preparation method, since PSII complexes located in the stroma are also isolated. In contrast to previous reports, PsbS was solely found as a monomer on SDS-PAGE in the PSII core complexes of tobacco. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Various types of redox mediators (RMs) have been proposed to reduce the charging voltage. However, the RMs tend to lose their activity during cycling owing to not only decomposition reactions but also undesirable discharge (shuttle effect) at the Li metal anode. Moreover, the dendrite growth of the Li metal anode is not resolved by merely adding RMs to the electrolytes. Here we report a simple yet highly effective method to reduce the charge overpotential while protecting the Li metal anode by incorporating LiBr and LiNO3 in a tetraglyme solvent as the electrolyte for Li-O-2 cells. The Br-/Br-3(-) couple acts as oxidize the discharge product Li2O2 at the cathode, whereas the NO3- anion oxidizes the Li metal surface to prevent the shuttle reaction. In this work, we found that both anions work synergistically in the mixed Br-/NO3- electrolyte to dramatically suppress both parasitic reactions and dendrite formation by generating a solid Li2O thin film on the Li metal anode. As a result, the charge voltage was reduced to below 3.6 V over 40 cycles. The O-2 evolution during charging was more than 80% of the theoretical value, and CO2 emission during charging was negligible. After cycling, the Li metal anode showed smooth surfaces with no indication of dendrite formation. These observations clearly demonstrate that the Br-/NO3- dual-anion electrolyte can solve the problems associated with both the overpotential at the cathode and the dendrite formation at the anode.									50	2	0	0	2	0	51			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000407540400034	28714666

We report an application of cerium histochemistry (in which capture of OFRs by Ce atoms results in laser-reflectant cerium-perhydroxide precipitates) combined with reflectance confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) to demonstrate the evolution of oxidative stress in taurocholate-induced acute pancreatitis (AP) in rats. Animals were perfused with CeCl3 in vivo and cryostat sections of pancreata were studied by CLSM. Vascular endothelium was immunolabeled for PECAM-1. OFR production by isolated polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNs) incubated in vitro with CeCl3 was quantified by image analysis. In the pancreas, strong OFR-derived cerium reflectance signals were seen in acinar cells at 1-2 hr, capillaries and small venules were frequently engorged by cerium precipitates, and adherent PMNs presented weak intracellular reflectance signals. At 8-24 hr, acinar cell OFR production decreased, whereas adherent/transmigrated PMNs displayed abundant intra- and pericellular reflectance. PECAM-1 expression was unchanged. PMNs from ascites or blood showed significant (p<0.01) time-dependent OFR production, plateauing from 2 hr. The modified cerium capture/CLSM method allows the co-demonstration of in vivo oxidative stress and cellular structures labeled with fluorescent markers. In vivo oxidative stress was shown histologically for the first time in experimental AP.									35	3	1	0	30	0	40			0022-1554			WOS:000082239100012	10449541

Morrison Pendant, California								GEOLOGICAL SOCIETY OF AMERICA BULLETIN				116	1-2			76	93		10.1130/B25239.1				JAN-FEB 2004	2004	Late Cretaceous contact metamorphism at Laurel Mountain, east-central California, resulted in growth of wollastonite in calcareous metasandstones during infiltration of water-rich [X(CO2) = 0.03-0.14] fluids. Fluids originated from the Laurel Mountain pluton and other magmatic sources. The mapped distribution of wollastonite versus calcite + quartz in the aureole reveals geometrically complex fluid flow paths at a range of scales. An inner aureole, concentric to the pluton, extends up to 500 m from exposed contacts and is characterized by ubiquitous wollastonite. An outer aureole has irregular distribution of wollastonite, chiefly at faults and stratigraphic contacts.Fluid flow was largely vertical during metamorphism, and permeability varied systematically. As fluids migrated up from crystallizing magmas into pendant rocks, they were variably channeled along a hierarchy of structural features. Faults in the aureole transported the largest fluid fluxes as recorded by delta(18)O(Wo) values (7-8parts per thousand) that approach equilibrium with the pluton. These faults distributed fluids up and away from the Laurel Mountain pluton. Of the total fluid flow, 2-4% was across layers, which mixed low-delta(13)C carbon (-25parts per thousand) from pelites into wollastonite metasandstones. Textural and isotopic data indicate that mineral reaction in the inner aureole was controlled by availability of fluids, permeability, and likely temperature; reaction in the outer aureole was driven mostly by access to water-rich fluids. Magmatic fluids in the outer aureole were isotopically shifted farther from magmatic values than fluids in the inner aureole and are inferred to have traveled from deeper sources.Isotope disequilibrium is widespread at Laurel Mountain. Values of Delta(18)O(Qt-Cc) in calcareous sandstones (1.78 +/- 0.3%) indicate exchange, but not equilibration at peak metamorphic temperatures (560degreesC). Most Delta(18)O(Qt-Wo) values (2.0-6.5%) indicate kinetically controlled exchange and disequilibrium during fluid-rock interaction. Minor isotopic resetting in the aureole was caused by polymetamorphism related to younger plutonism in the eastern Sierra Nevada. This study highlights the complexities of modeling fluid flow during contact metamorphism in composite batholith settings. These complexities include multiple fluid and heat sources, plus variable permeability, temperature, mineral-fluid exchange, and flow path.									19	0	0	0	0	0	19			0016-7606	1943-2674		WOS:000188249100006

Herein, by coating a formamide-derived highly N-modified carbonaceous layer as a "glue" on commercially available activated carbon black (AC), a hundred-gram scale synthesis of atomically dispersed non-noble metal-nitrogen-carbon (MNC) materials was realized, including but not limited to Fe, Co, Ni, Mn, and Cu. The dispersion and coordination environments of Fe atoms on AC were initially revealed by XRD, HRTEM, and XPS, and further confirmed by HAADF-STEM and XANES analysis, presenting Fe atoms in a Fe-N-4 structure. The atomically dispersed metal species, though relatively low-loading grafted on AC (typical loading of 0.16 to 0.29 at%), are mostly distributed on the electrochemically accessible surface, resulting in improved metal utilization. The FeNC@AC-3 sample exhibited highly comparable catalytic performance to 20 wt% Pt/C for the alkaline oxygen reduction reaction, and superior Al-air battery performance. Our work may inspire the synthesis of other types of SACs for broad electrocatalysis applications at kilogram or even ton scale.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000709507700001	34673874

Ozone generation was observed when the concentration of Ta of the catalyst layer was 70% and above and the maximum current efficiency of ozone generation was 6%. Scanning electron microscopy revealed cracks, which were capable of ozone generation, reaching the Pt buffered layer of the electrode. It is concluded that the cracks were the paths of the electrolyte and that electronic transfer was accomplished on the surface of the buffered layer. &COPY; 2005 The Electrochemical Society.

While common among anaerobic prokaryotes, this enzyme has so far been found in only two distantly related eukaryotic lineages, anaerobic chytridiomycetes and chlorophytes. Sequence comparisons of homologues from the chytridiomycetes Piromyces and Neocallimastix, the chlorophyte Chlamydomonas, and numerous prokaryotes suggest a single, eubacterial origin of eukaryotic pyruvate formate lyases. Pyruvate formate lyase activating enzyme introduces the glycyl radical into the pyruvate formate lyase protein chain. We discovered this enzyme, which had not previously been reported from eukaryotes, in the same two eukaryotic lineages and show that it shares a similar evolutionary history to pyruvate formate lyase. Sequences with high homology to pyruvate formate lyase activating enzyme were identified in the genomes of the anaerobic protozoan parasites Trichomonas vaginalis, Entamoeba histolytica, and Giardia intestinalis. While the occurrence of pyruvate formate lyase activating enzyme together with pyruvate formate lyase in fungi and chlorophytes was to be expected, the target protein of a glycyl radical enzyme-activating enzyme in these protozoa remains to be identified.									18	0	0	0	18	0	19			1066-5234	1550-7408		WOS:000222957300011	15352329

Thioredoxin system is one of the principal factors that maintain the intracellular redox balance via its antioxidant property. In this study, we characterized two new thioredoxin isoforms (SsTXN-like 1 and SsMtTXN-like) from black rockfish, Sebastes schlegelii. The molecular and structural characteristics, as well as the evolutionary relationships of SsTXN-like 1 and SsMtTXN-like confirmed that they belong to the thioredoxin superfamily. A classical thioredoxin domain was found in both proteins with a conserved redox-active site CXYC, however, only the precursor of SsMtTXN-like protein possessed a mitochondrial targeting signal. The results from insulin disulfide reduction activity assay demonstrated that their recombinant proteins are capable of reducing the disulfide bonds of oxidatively damaged proteins via their oxidoreductase activities. The free radical scavenging activity assay revealed the prominent hydroxyl and DPPH scavenging activities of rSsTXN-like I and rSsMtTXN-like in a dose-dependent manner. Transcriptional studies showed a broad distribution of SsTXN-like 1 and SsMtTXN-like transcripts in all the examined tissues. Significant (p < 0.05) up-regulations of both genes in immune-related tissues after LPS, poly I:C and Streptococcus iniae challenges reflect their critical role in redox homeostasis in black rockfish. Taken together, SsTXN-like 1 and SsMtTXN-like, as two active members of thioredoxin superfamily, have significant antioxidant properties to housekeep the redox potential during various stress conditions and innate immune response of Sebastes schlegelii.

As the dominant ore mineral at Beiya, magnetite has been selected as a petrogenetic indicator to understand the ore-forming process. In this study, magnetites have been divided into the euhedral-subhedral (M-E), anhedral (M-A), lamellar (M-L), and replaced (M-R) types based on their textures, which have been further determined by in situ laser ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry analyses. In detail, plots in discriminant diagrams constrain the Beiya magnetite a hydrothermal origin. Trace elements in magnetite vary with respect to different textures. Titanium concentrations are similar in all magnetite types, suggesting that all magnetites were precipitated in a relatively narrow temperature range. The decreasing V content combined with haematite after magnetite (martitization) suggests that the oxygen fugacity increased from M-E and M-A and then decreased to M-L and M-R. All magnetite types show similar content variations and similar (Mg + Mn)/Al ratios, indicating a decreasing degree of fluid-rock interactions. The rim-core texture indicates that the M-R type magnetite has experienced the dissolution-reprecipitation process. Mushketovite marks the later ore-forming environment and the iron-rich hydrothermal fluids transformed from high temperature and oxidized to low temperature and reduced features. Magnetite textures, combined with its trace element variations, could be used as a potential tool for inferring the ore-forming fluid evolution.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0072-1050	1099-1034		WOS:000656338400001

Herein, a novel 2D/2D nanojunction architecture of Ba5Nb4O15/g-C-3 N-4 photocatalysts with powerful interfacial charge transfer are rationally designed. Advanced electron microscopy analysis elucidates the layered hexagonal nanosheets were coupled on the surface of ultrathin g-C3N4 forming a 2D/2D nanojunction. More importantly, such characterizations and theoretical calculations together illustrate that a strong interfacial charge transfer existed between the g-C3N4 layer and Ba-O layer of the Ba5Nb4O15 nanosheets, which fostered the efficient transfer and provided more massive reactive centers for photocatalytic hydrogen evolution. The unique 2D/2D structure in Ba5Nb4O15/g-C-3 N-4 heterojunction leads to generate numerous charge transfer nanochannels, and which could accelerate the interfacial charge separation efficiency to a great extent. Ba5Nb4O15/g-C-3 N-4 (1:20) sample displayed a remarkable photocatalytic H-2 evolution rate (2.67 mmol h(-1) g(-1)) in oxalic acid solution, nearly 2.35 times higher than that of single g-C3N4 under visible light and exhibits an outstanding photostability even after four cycles. This work would provide a new insight for the design of 2D/2D heterojunction photocatalyst with efficient interfacial charge transfer and separation for solar-to-H-2 conversion.									149	16	0	0	19	0	152			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000510526000030

Electrolyte solutions and polymerization parameters were optimized prior to overoxidation. The effect of overoxidation time has been optimized by cyclic voltammetry (CV) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), which results in the film overoxidized for 45 s at 1.35 V presenting a strong adsorption. The other one-step overoxidation film prepared by direct CV ranging from -0.6 V to 1.35 V was polymerized for comparison. Scanning electron microscope (SEM) analysis and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy were used for monitoring morphological changes and the evolution of functional groups. Both of them indicate increased abundant oxygen functional groups and roughness, yet the products exhibit dendritic morphology and piles of spherical protrusions, respectively. Moreover, double-step overoxidized film showed better electrochemical performance toward lead ion sensing. These characterizations highlight some novel properties that may be beneficial for specific sensing applications.									14	1	0	0	3	0	14				1424-8220		WOS:000398818700201	28335500

In Azospirillum brasilense, energy taxis was shown to be the principal form of locomotor control. In the present study, we have identified a novel chemoreceptor-like protein, named Tlp1, which serves as an energy taxis transducer. The Tlp1 protein is predicted to have an N-terminal periplasmic region and a cytoplasmic C-terminal signaling module homologous to those of other chemoreceptors. The predicted periplasmic region of Tlp1 comprises a conserved domain that is found in two types of microbial sensory receptors: chemotaxis transducers and histidine kinases. However, the function of this domain is currently unknown. We characterized the behavior of a tlp1 mutant by a series of spatial and temporal gradient assays. The tlp1 mutant is deficient in (i) chemotaxis to several rapidly oxidizable substrates, (ii) taxis to terminal electron acceptors (oxygen and nitrate), and (iii) redox taxis. Taken together, the data strongly suggest that Tlp1 mediates energy taxis in A. brasilense. Using qualitative and quantitative assays, we have also demonstrated that the tlp1 mutant is impaired in colonization of plant roots. This finding supports the hypothesis that energy taxis and therefore bacterial metabolism might be key factors in determining host specificity in Azospirillum-grass associations.									63	1	0	0	61	0	64			0021-9193	1098-5530		WOS:000223988700029	15375141

In order to grow single crystals at lower temperature two techniques were used: flux and chemical vapor growth. alpha- and beta-VO(PO3)(2) single crystals were grown from V-P-O flux and by vapor transport mediated by TeCl4. Because of a high viscosity of the flux the crystallized material contains inclusions of flux. Vapor transport growth leads to crystals of a higher quality. The crystals contain no inclusions of foreign phases and contaminations of Te and Cl which might be introduced by transport agent. Magnetic susceptibility measurements of beta-VO(PO3)(2) single crystals indicate a quasi one-dimensional system with weak antiferromagnetic interactions. The temperature dependence of the magnetic susceptibility shows the parameters of the interaction (intra and interchain) to be essentially similar with the previously published parameters of alpha-phase.

Recently, we proposed that the low photocurrent density in film-based BiFeO3 (BFO) is due to charge recombination at the interface of the domain walls, which could be largely reduced in particulate photocatalyst systems. To demonstrate this hypothesis, in this work we synthesized particulate BFO and Mn-doped BiFeO3 (Mn-BFO) by the sol-gel method. Photocatalytic water oxidation tests showed that pure BFO had an intrinsic photocatalytic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity of 70 mu mol h(-1) g(-1), while BFO-2, with an optimum amount of Mn doping (0.05%), showed an OER activity of 255 mu mol h(-1) g(-1) under visible light (lambda >= 420 nm) irradiation. The bandgap of Mn-doped BFO could be reduced from 2.1 to 1.36 eV by varying the amount of Mn doping. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations suggested that surface Fe (rather than Mn) species serve as the active sites for water oxidation, because the over-potential for water oxidation on Fe species after Mn doping is 0.51 V, which is the lowest value measured for the different Fe and Mn species examined in this study. The improved photocatalytic water oxidation activity of Mn-BFO is ascribed to the synergistic effect of the bandgap narrowing, which increases the absorption of visible light, reduces the activation energy of water oxidation, and inhibits the recombination of photogenerated charges. This work demonstrates that Mn doping is an effective strategy to enhance the intrinsic photocatalytic water oxidation activity of particulate ferroelectric BFO photocatalysts.

Batteries are vital to this endeavor, whether used in electric vehicles, to store renewable electricity, or in aviation. Present lithium-ion technologies are preparing the public for this inevitable change, but their maximum theoretical specific capacity presents a limitation. Their high cost is another concern for commercial viability. Metal-air batteries have the highest theoretical energy density of all possible secondary battery technologies and could yield step changes in energy storage, if their practical difficulties could be overcome. The scope of this review is to provide an objective, comprehensive, and authoritative assessment of the intensive work invested in nonaqueous rechargeable metal-air batteries over the past few years, which identified the key problems and guides directions to solve them. We focus primarily on the challenges and outlook for Li-O-2 cells but include Na-O-2, K-O-2,O- and Mg-O-2 cells for comparison. Our review highlights the interdisciplinary nature of this field that involves a combination of materials chemistry, electrochemistry, computation, microscopy, spectroscopy, and surface science. The mechanisms of O-2 reduction and evolution are considered in the light of recent findings, along with developments in positive and negative electrodes, electrolytes, electrocatalysis on surfaces and in solution, and the degradative effect of singlet oxygen, which is typically formed in Li-O-2 cells.									320	21	0	0	12	0	327			0009-2665	1520-6890		WOS:000555413600008	32134255

This misjudgment leads to the potentially detrimental yet unwittingly falsified data accumulation in the literature that requires immediate attention. Alternatively, sampled-current voltammetry (SCV) constructed from steady-state responses is advised to be widely adopted for screening electrocatalysts that are actually destined for steady-state operations. To show that this exaggeration is universal, a well-characterized activated SS, coprecipitated Co(OH)(2), and Pt foil electrodes are studied for OER and HER in 1.0 M KOH. The results urge that it is time to adopt a relatively more precise alternative technique such as SCV. (C) 2022 The Electrochemical Society ("ECS").

This mechanism does not involve a divalent metal cation in agreement with the experimental evidence. The process is assisted by two proton transfers that activate the nucleophile (first step) and the leaving group (second step). The dA(13) nucleotide is not directly involved in the reaction. However, it plays an important role in determining the regioselectivity of the process: since the dA(13) phosphate forms a strong hydrogen bond with the 2'-hydroxyl, only the 3'-hydroxyl can behave as a nucleophile and form the new 3'-5' bond. In silico mutagenesis, where the dA(13) phosphate oxygen involved in the hydrogen contact was replaced by a sulfur atom, causes a significant rearrangement of the A(50) ribose position with an increase in the activation barrier and a consequent lower enzymatic activity in agreement with the experimental evidence. A similar effect is determined by the replacement of the 2'-hydroxyl with different groups such as F, H, and OMe.									8	0	1	0	1	0	9			1549-9596	1549-960X		WOS:000465644500025	30702292

Compelling evidence indicates that RACK1 can interact with many signal molecules and affect different signal transduction pathways. In this study, we cloned a maize RACK1 gene (ZmRACK1) by RT-PCR. The amino acid sequence of ZmRACK1 had seven WD repeats in which there were typical GH (glycine-histidine) and WD dipeptides. Comparison with OsRACK1 from rice revealed 89% identity at the amino acid level. Expression pattern analysis by RT-PCR showed that ZmRACK1 was expressed in all analyzed tissues of maize and that its transcription in leaves was induced by abscisic acid and jasmonate at a high concentration. Overexpression of ZmRACK1 in maize led to a reduction in symptoms caused by Exserohilum turcicum (Pass.) on maize leaves. The expression levels of the pathogenesis-related protein genes, PR-1 and PR-5, increased 2.5-3 times in transgenic maize, and reactive oxygen species production was more active than in the wild-type. Yeast two-hybrid assays showed that ZmRACK1 could interact with RAC1, RAR1 and SGT1. This study and previous work leads us to believe that ZmRACK1 may form a complex with regulators of plant disease resistance to coordinate maize reactions to pathogens.									21	4	0	0	18	0	25				1422-0067		WOS:000338639000011	24865494

The characteristics of 2D catalysts imply that both sides of the monolayer can be catalytic sites and adsorb electrolyte ions or molecules from solutions. Overstrong adsorption of electrolyte ions or molecules on both sides of the catalyst site will poison the catalyst, while the adsorbate on one side of the catalytic site will modify the activity and selectivity of the other side for NRR. Discovering the influence of adsorption of electrolyte ions or molecules as a functional ligand on catalyst performance on the NRR is crucial to improve NRR efficiency. Here, we report this work using the density functional theory (DFT) method to investigate adsorption of electrolyte ions or molecules as a functional ligand. Among all of the studied 18 functional ligands and 3 transition metals (TMs), the results showed that Ru&F, Ru&COOH, and Mo&H2O combinations were screened as electrocatalysis systems with high activity and selectivity. Particularly, the Mo&H2O combination possesses the highest activity with a low Delta G(MAX) of 0.44 eV through the distal pathway. The superior catalytic performance of the Mo&H2O combination is mainly attributed to the electron donation from the metal d orbital. Furthermore, the functional ligands can occupy the active sites and block the competing vigorous hydrogen evolution reaction. Our findings offer an effective and practical strategy to design the combination of the catalyst and electrolyte to improve electrocatalytic NRR efficiency.									4	0	0	0	0	0	3			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000693050200037	34415719

Composition has molecular weight (Mn) of 250-900 Da, measured using gel permeation chromatography and polystyrene calibration standards; and oxygen-to-carbon ratio of less than or equal to 5%. Composition is formed by decarboxylating a dimeric rosin acid or by dimerizing a decarboxylated rosin.

The resulting dimensionally stable and corrosion-resistant diamond thin-film consists of well-faceted microcrystallites with dispersed Pt particles incorporated into the surface. The metal particles are anchored into the diamond surface and range in diameter from 10 to 500 nm. The active Pt metal loading was in the range of 200 to 400 ng/cm(2) (diamond electrode geometric area). Most interestingly the Pt particles at the film surface are in electronic communication with the current collecting Si or Pt substrate through the boron-doped diamond matrix, and they are electroactive for the UPD of hydrogen and the oxidation of methanal. The dispersed Pt particles are extremely stable as no loss in the activity was observed after 1000 potential cycles Between the oxygen and hydrogen evolution regimes in 0.1 M HC10(4).

Evolution of light-independent protochlorophyllide oxidoreductase								PROTOPLASMA				256	2			293	312		10.1007/s00709-018-1317-y				MAR 2019	2019	The nonhomologous enzymes, the light-independent protochlorophyllide reductase (DPOR) and the light-dependent protochlorophyllide oxidoreductase (LPOR), catalyze the reduction of protochlorophyllide (Pchlide) to chlorophyllide (Chlide) in the penultimate step of biosynthesis of chlorophyll (Chl) required for photosynthetic light absorption and energy conversion. The two enzymes differ with respect to the requirement of light for catalysis and oxygen sensitivity. DPOR and LPOR initially evolved in the ancestral prokaryotic genome perhaps at different times. DPOR originated in the anoxygenic environment of the Earth from nitrogenase-like enzyme of methanogenic archaea. Due to the transition from anoxygenic to oxygenic photosynthesis in the prokaryote, the DPOR was mostly inactivated in the daytime by photosynthetic O-2 leading to the evolution of oxygen-insensitive LPOR that could function in the light. The primary endosymbiotic event transferred the DPOR and LPOR genes to the eukaryotic phototroph; the DPOR remained in the genome of the ancestor that turned into the plastid, whereas LPOR was transferred to the host nuclear genome. From an evolutionary point of view, several compelling theories that explain the disappearance of DPOR from several species cutting across different phyla are as follows: (i) pressure of the oxygenic environment; (ii) change in the light conditions and temperature; and (iii) lineage-specific gene losses, RNA editing, and nonsynonymous substitution. Certain primary amino acid sequence and the physiochemical properties of the ChlL subunit of DPOR have similarity with that of LPOR suggesting a convergence of these two enzymes in certain evolutionary event. The newly obtained sequence data from different phototrophs will further enhance the width of the phylogenetic information on DPOR.									11	0	0	0	7	0	11			0033-183X	1615-6102		WOS:000460669700002	30291443	
J	Kelly, Steven L.; Kelly, Diane E.								Microbial cytochromes P450: biodiversity and biotechnology. Where do cytochromes P450 come from, what do they do and what can they do for us?								PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES				368	1612	SI				20120476	10.1098/rstb.2012.0476				FEB 19 2013	2013	The first eukaryote genome revealed three yeast cytochromes P450 (CYPs), hence the subsequent realization that some microbial fungal genomes encode these proteins in 1 per cent or more of all genes (greater than 100) has been surprising. They are unique biocatalysts undertaking a wide array of stereo- and regio-specific reactions and so hold promise in many applications. Based on ancestral activities that included 14 alpha-demethylation during sterol biosynthesis, it is now seen that CYPs are part of the genes and metabolism of most eukaryotes. In contrast, Archaea and Eubacteria often do not contain CYPs, while those that do are frequently interesting as producers of natural products undertaking their oxidative tailoring. Apart from roles in primary and secondary metabolism, microbial CYPs are actual/potential targets of drugs/agrochemicals and CYP51 in sterol biosynthesis is exhibiting evolution to resistance in the clinic and the field. Other CYP applications include the first industrial biotransformation for corticosteroid production in the 1950s, the diversion into penicillin synthesis in early mutations in fungal strain improvement and bioremediation using bacteria and fungi. The vast untapped resource of orphan CYPs in numerous genomes is being probed and new methods for discovering function and for discovering desired activities are being investigated.									132	2	0	0	103	0	134			0962-8436	1471-2970		WOS:000313343600009	23297358	
J	Ma, Rui; Shao, Lianyi; Wu, Kaiqiang; Shui, Miao; Wang, Dongjie; Long, Nengbing; Ren, Yuanlong; Shu, Jie								Effects of oxidation on structure and performance of LiVPO4F as cathode material for lithium-ion batteries								JOURNAL OF POWER SOURCES				248				874	885		10.1016/j.jpowsour.2013.10.029				FEB 15 2014	2014	In this paper, a series of LiVPO4F-based samples are prepared through sintering LiVPO4F at different temperatures under air. Experimental results show that the pristine sample is oxidized to a new compound Li(1-x)VPO(4)F(1-y)Oz (0 <x < 0.2, 0.9 <y < 1, 0.9 <z <1) with similar structure of LiVPO4O under air at 550 C or higher one. In-situ X-ray diffraction patterns indicate that the original material LiVPO4F undergoes two two-phase structural evolutions upon Li+ electrochemical extraction at average operating potentials at 4.26 and 4.30 V, corresponding to the continuous transformation of LiVPO4F -> Li0.72VPO4F -> VPO4F in the first charge process. In the reverse discharge process, there is only one twophase structural transition VPO4F -> VPO4F without the appearance of the intermediate phase Li0.72VPO4F on Li+ insertion reaction at 4.18 V. Therefore, the extraction/insertion process of LiVPO4F is an asymmetrical phase transformation. When the sintering temperature is raised to 550 degrees C, Li(1-x)VPO(4)F(1-y)Oz exhibits extremely poor electrochemical performance, which is attributed to the volatilization loss of lithium and the replacement of fluorine by oxygen in the structure during the sintering process under air. However, Li(1-x)VPO(4)F(1-y)Oz has a very stable structure during the whole process of galvanostatic charge/discharge cycles as confirmed by in-situ X-ray diffraction technique.

Herein, we prepared ZnS/ZnO heterojunctions highly dispersed on porous biomass carbons (ZnS/ZnO@C) through a one-step carbothermal reduction process at elevated temperatures. By means of the proposed synthetic pathway, the ZnS/ZnO@C composites were enabled with visible-light-driven photocatalytic capacity, despite either ZnS or ZnO being catalytically inactive for H-2 production under visible irradiation. The as-prepared photocatalyst with a 1 : 1 mole ratio of zinc and carbon sources at 800 degrees C displayed an optimal H-2 production rate of ca. 37.1 mu mol h(-1) g(-1). TEM images and UV-DRS spectra suggested that the formation of ZnS/ZnO heterojunctions would induce the generation of oxygen defects in ZnO to greatly promote visible light adsorption. Electrochemistry analyses and time-resolved photoluminescence spectra demonstrated that more efficient separation of photo-induced carriers took place via the interfaces of ZnO/ZnS heterojunctions, prolonging the charge separation lifetime. Moreover, porous biomass carbons would serve as electron conductors to efficiently improve the photo-induced electron transfer from the bulk of ZnS/ZnO to surfaces for boosting the reduction of H2O to H-2. The ZnS/ZnO heterojunctions with oxygen defects coupled with porous biomass carbons jointly achieved highly efficient H-2 production under visible irradiation. This work thus provided a facile means by using low-cost porous biomass carbons to design robust and flexible photocatalysts for visible-light-driven H-2 production with high efficiency.									23	0	0	0	2	0	23			2052-1553			WOS:000479129600012

However, the high voltage causes severe decomposition of conventional carbonate-based electrolytes at LLOs' surfaces, often producing a non-uniform, unstable, and non-protective cathode-electrolyte interphase (CEI), hindering the Li+ diffusion and reducing the electrochemical efficiency. Various side reactions, such as the release of lattice oxygen, dissolution of transition metals (especially manganese), and irreversible structural transformations, also occur and severely attenuate the electrochemical performance. Electrolyte additives provide a facile and effective approach to optimize the battery performance by in situ regulating the physical/chemical structures/properties of CEI. This paper reviews the research progress in functional electrolyte additives for LLOs and discusses the mechanisms of CEI construction with diverse functions. Finally, we tentatively propose suggestions to construct CEI by screening and customizing electrolyte additives to promote the large-scale application of LLOs for LIBs.									18	1	0	0	0	0	18			2380-8195			WOS:000672746800024

Here we investigate the advantages of using helical nanostructures in photoelectrochemical solar water splitting. A helical tungsten trioxide array is fabricated on a fluorine-doped tin oxide substrate, followed by subsequent coating with bismuth vanadate/catalyst. A maximum photocurrent density of similar to 5.35 +/- 0.15 mA cm(-2) is achieved at 1.23V versus the reversible hydrogen electrode, and related hydrogen and oxygen evolution is also observed from this heterojunction. Theoretical simulations and analyses are performed to verify the advantages of this helical structure. The combination of effective light scattering, improved charge separation and transportation, and an enlarged contact surface area with electrolytes due to the use of the bismuth vanadate-decorated tungsten trioxide helical nanostructures leads to the highest reported photocurrent density to date at 1.23V versus the reversible hydrogen electrode, to the best of our knowledge.									345	21	0	0	27	0	348			2041-1723			WOS:000342841300002	25179126

High Efficiency Photocatalysis for Pollutant Degradation with MoS2/C3N4 Heterostructures								LANGMUIR				30	29			8965	8972		10.1021/la502033t				JUL 29 2014	2014	Porous graphitic carbon nitride was synthesized by controllable thermal polymerization of urea in air. Their textural, electrical, and optical properties were tuned by varying the heating rate. The presence of proper residual oxygen in carbon nitride matrix had enhanced light absorption and inhibited the recombination of charge carriers. Furthermore, the MoS2 nanosheets were coupled into the carbon nitride to form MoS2/C3N4 heterostructures via a facile ultrasonic chemical method. The optimized MoS2/C3N4 heterostructure with 0.05 wt % MoS2 showed a reaction rate constant as high as 0.301 min(-1), which was 3.6 times that of bare carbon nitride. As analyzed by SEM, TEM, UV-vis absorption, PL and photoelectrochemical measurements, intimate contact interface, extended light response range, enhanced separation speed of charge carriers, and high photocurrent density upon MoS2 coupling led to the photocatalytic promotion of the MoS2/C3N4 heterostructures. In this architecture, MoS2 served as electron trapper to extend the lifetime of separated electron hole pairs. Meanwhile, the accumulated holes on the surface of carbon nitride oxidized the organic dye directly, which was a predominant process in the photodegradation of organic pollutants in water treatment. The promotional mechanisms and principles reported here would have great significance in heterogeneous photocatalysis.									309	18	0	0	27	1	320			0743-7463			WOS:000339686700039	25017627	
J	Cui, Xinjiang; Shi, Feng								Selective Conversion of CO2 by Single-Site Catalysts								ACTA PHYSICO-CHIMICA SINICA				37	5					2006080	10.3866/PKU.WHXB202006080				MAY 15 2021	2021	Industrial revolution has led to increased combustion of fossil fuels. Consequently, large amounts of CO2 are emitted to the atmosphere, throwing the carbon cycle out of balance. Currently, the most effective method to reduce the CO2 concentration is direct CO2 capture from the atmosphere and pumping of the captured CO2 deep underground or into the mid-ocean. The transformation of CO2 into high-value chemicals is an attractive yet challenging task. In recent years, there has been much interest in the development of CO2 utilization technologies based on electrochemical CO2 reduction, photochemical CO2 reduction, and thermal CO2 reduction, and CO2 valorization has emerged as a hot research topic. In electrochemical CO2 reduction, the cathodic reaction is the reduction of CO2 to value-added chemicals. The anodic reaction should be the oxygen evolution reaction, and water is the only renewable and scalable source of electrons and protons in this reaction. There is a plethora of research on the use of various metals to catalyze this reaction. Among these, Cu-based materials have been demonstrated to show unique catalytic activity and stability for the electrochemical conversion of CO2 to valuable fuels and chemicals. Moreover, the solar-driven conversion of CO2 into value-added chemical fuels has attracted great attention, and much effort is being devoted to develop novel catalysts for the photoreduction of CO2, especially by mimicking the natural photosynthetic process. The key step in the photocatalytic process is the efficient generation of electron-hole pairs and separation of these charge carriers. The efficient separation of photoinduced charge carriers plays a crucial role in the final catalytic activity. Compared with CO2 reduction via electrocatalysis and photocatalysis, thermal reduction is more attractive because of its potential large-scale application in the industry. Heterogeneous nanomaterials show excellent activity in the electrocatalytic, photocatalytic, and thermal catalytic conversion of CO2. However, nanostructured materials have drawbacks on the investigation of the intrinsic activity of the active sites. In recent years, single-site catalysts have become popular because they allow for maximum utilization of the metal centers, show specific catalytic performance, and facilitate easy elucidation of the catalytic mechanism at the molecular level. Accordingly, numerous single-site catalysts were developed for CO2 reduction to produce value-added chemicals such as CO, CH4, CH3OH, formate, and C2+ products. Value-added chemicals have also been synthesized with the aid of amines and epoxides. This review summarizes recent state-of-the-art single-site catalysts and their application as heterogeneous catalysts for the electroreduction, photoreduction, and thermal reduction of CO2. In the discussion, we will highlight the structure-activity relationships for the catalytic conversion of CO2 with single-site catalysts.									14	4	0	0	0	0	14			1000-6818			WOS:000616614800018

Previous studies investigate the interactions and feedbacks between ocean circulation, weathering, and atmospheric CO2 levels during this time. Here we explore the role of biogeochemical sulfur cycling, and report seawater sulfate isotope data across the EOT. Our data show that seawater sulfate delta S-34 and delta O-18(SO4) values decline by 0.6 parts per thousand and 1.5 parts per thousand, respectively, between 34.5 and 33 Ma. Quantitative modeling suggests that approximately 8,000 Gt of the sulfide previously stored in shelf sediments has been reoxidized and transferred to the marine sulfate pool. This reoxidation process proceeds through reactions similar to those associated with acid mine drainage, generating 24,500 Gt sulfuric acid. These numbers are of similar magnitude as those estimated for Pleistocene glaciations and must have affected marine pH and/or alkalinity. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V.

The coal structure was characterized by Raman spectroscopy and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). The Raman results show that the ILs treatment can inhibit the low-temperature oxidation activity of disorder structure in coal. The FTIR results demonstrate that the ILs can break and dissolve the associated hydrogen bonds and methylene groups, so that the low-temperature oxidation activity of ILs-treated coal is inhibited. The analysis on oxygen consumption and index gases of coals by gas chromatograph further confirms the spectra results that ILs treatment can inhibit the low-temperature oxidation of coal. The inhibition effect is in the order of [BMIm][OTf]>[BMIm][BF4]>[BMIm][Ac].									13	2	0	0	0	0	14			1939-2699	1939-2702		WOS:000322300000004

PRRs recruit receptor-like cytoplasmic kinases (RLCKs) to transduce the perceived signal to downstream signaling components. Brassinosteroid-signaling kinase 5 (BSK5) is a member of the RLCK XII subfamily and mutational analysis revealed its involvement in plant immunity. Here, we provide evidence that overexpression of BSK5 in transgenic Arabidopsis plants enhanced disease resistance to the bacterial pathogen Pseudomonas syringae and to the fungus Botrytis cinerea. Remarkably, upon treatment with the flg22, elf18 and pep1 PAMP/DAMPs, BSK5-overexpressing plants displayed higher levels of immune responses, including production of reactive oxygen species, callose deposition at the cell wall, and PATHOGENESIS-RELATED1 (PR1) gene expression. Together, these findings further substantiate the role of BSK5 in plant immunity and illustrate its potential use for improving plant disease resistance.									3	0	0	0	2	0	3			1559-2316	1559-2324		WOS:000474186500001	31262220

A gas chromatography was used to quantify the syngas evolved. Pure nitrogen was used for pyrolysis while two different oxygen concentrations (21% and 10%) in nitrogen were used for gasification. Five specific temperatures examined during pyrolysis and gasification were from 600 to 1000 degrees C in steps of 100 degrees C. Higher O-2 concentration (21%) produced higher energy yields compared to lower O-2 concentrations. Initial 8-10 min yield produced CO2 dominant syngas from decarboxylation after which the compositions changed to equilibrium. High temperature and low O-2 concentrations yielded higher CO flow rates and amounts. Equilibrium H-2 content was reduced with an increase in O-2 concentration due to the rapid oxidation of H-2 in the presence of oxidative environment. CH4 was obtained from thermal cracking with its evolution being similar to that of other higher hydrocarbons evolved, albeit in smaller concentration. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Structure and reactivity of iridium oxide layers grown on Ir(100) by oxidation at sub-ambient O-2 pressures								JOURNAL OF PHYSICS D-APPLIED PHYSICS				52	43					434002	10.1088/1361-6463/ab32cc				OCT 23 2019	2019	We used low energy electron diffraction (LEED) and temperature programmed desorption (TPD) to investigate the structure and reactivity of iridium oxide layers prepared by oxidizing Ir(100) at 765 K and O-2 pressures ranging from 0.05 to 5 Torr. Our LEED results provide evidence that Ir(100) oxidation at O-2 pressures up to 0.20 Torr produces a mixture of Ir oxide structures present as small domains, including a commensurate IrO2(101) structure that coexists with other structures. Oxidizing from 0.50 to 1 Torr causes formation of a commensurate IrO2(110)R27 degrees structure and a sharp rise in the oxygen uptake from similar to 8 to 20 ML (monolayer) as the films exhibit signs of roughening. Further increasing the O-2 pressure from 1 to 5 Torr causes the IrO2(110)R27 degrees structure to be replaced with a so-called IrO2(110)-aligned structure, for which the IrO2(110) lattice vectors align with those of the Ir(100) substrate. We find that the oxidized Ir(100) surfaces become increasingly reactive toward the dissociation and oxidation of CH4 as IrO2(110) develops on the surface, and observe that the IrO2(110)-aligned structure is more reactive than the IrO2(110)R27 degrees phase. Our findings demonstrate that the oxide phase evolution on Ir(100) is sensitive to the O-2 pressure in the range from 0.05 to 5 Torr, and that the development of reactive IrO2(110) structures requires elevated O-2 pressures (>0.5 Torr) and temperature.									13	0	0	0	0	0	13			0022-3727	1361-6463		WOS:000480291800002

We have focused on the DNA polymerases involved in DNA replication including the unnatural base pair between 7-(2-thienyl) imidazo[ 4,5-b] pyridine (Ds) and 2-nitro-4-propynylpyrrole (Px). Many reports have described the different combinations between unnatural base pairs and DNA polymerases. As an example, for the replication of the Ds-Px pair, Deep Vent DNA polymerase exhibits high efficiency and fidelity, but Taq DNA polymerase shows much lower efficiency and fidelity. In the present study, we determined the crystal structure of Deep Vent DNA polymerase in the apo form at 2.5 angstrom resolution. Using this structure, we constructed structural models of Deep Vent DNA polymerase complexes with DNA containing an unnatural or natural base in the replication position. The models revealed that the unnatural Ds base in the template-strand DNA clashes with the side-chain oxygen of Thr664 in Taq DNA polymerase, but not in Deep Vent DNA polymerase.

However, Ni-rich cathodes suffer from severe surface reconstruction in a high delithiation state, constraining their rate capabilities and life span. Herein, a novel P2-type NaxNi0.33Mn0.67O2 (NNMO) is rationally selected as the surficial modification layer for LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 (NCM811) cathode, which undergoes a spontaneous Na+-Li+ exchange reaction to form an O2-type LixNi(0.33)Mn(0.67)O(2) (LNMO) layer revealed by combining X-ray diffraction and solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance techniques. Owing to the specific oxygen stacking sequence, O2-type LNMO significantly prevents the initial layered structure of NCM811 from transforming to the spinel or rock-salt phases during cycling, thus effectively maintaining the integral surficial structure and the Li+ diffusion channels of NCM811. Eventually, the NNMO@NCM811 electrode yields enhanced thermal stability, outstanding rate performance, and long cycling stability with 80% capacity retention after 294 cycles at 200 mA g(-1), and its life span is further extended to 531 cycles while enhancing the mechanical stability of the bulk material.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000818745600001	35748137

The shelled bimetallic phosphates can lower the OER overpotential by up to 100 mV compared with their unshelled phosphate counterparts as well as show superior stability up to 80 h at a high current density of 40 mA cm(-2) for alkaline water splitting. Detailed studies reveal that the newly formed metal oxyhydroxide/oxide/hydroxide during electrocatalysis plays key roles in the activity enhancement. In addition, the N-doped carbon shell can largely prevent serious corrosion/aggregation with the surface environment being largely maintained, showing a unique strategy for designing non-precious electrocatalysts with largely improved activity and stability for overall water splitting and beyond.									22	2	0	0	0	0	23			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000453248100009	30488052

The photocatalytic degradation of acid orange II based on Zn-TDTAPc-SF/O-2 system was investigated under visible light irradiation (lambda >= 400 nm). The results indicated that Zn-TDTAPc-SF exhibited excellent photocatalytic performance in the presence of O-2 under visible light irradiation. In 6 h, more than 93% of acid orange II (AO2) in Zn-TDTAPc-SF/O-2 system was eliminated at initial pH 5 under visible light irradiation, and Zn-TDTAPc-SF still remained effective in repetitive fives cycles. Furthermore, NaCl played a positive role in the catalytic reaction, different from the negative one observed in homogeneous catalysis, and the reaction can proceed in a more wide pH range from acidic to alkaline. Based on the analysis of FT-IR and Gas Chromatography/Mass Spectrometry (GCeMS), AO2 was mainly converted into some small molecular biodegradable aliphatic carboxylic compounds such as maleic acid, fumaric acid, succinic acid, etc. The photodegradation mechanism for the evolution of AO2 was proposed by Electron Paramagnetic Resonance (EPR) spectra.

In this study, we fabricated two types of anodes for the treatment of reverse osmosis concentrates (ROCs). These two anodes were fabricated based on the enhanced nanotube array (ENTA) as internal structure. One anode is only coated by SnO2-Sb layer on the ENTA (Ti-ENTA/SnO2-Sb), while the other one is coated by SnO2-Sb layer and plus PbO2 layer (Ti-ENTA/SnO2-Sb/PbO2). It was found that the ENTA improved the electrochemical properties (e.g., oxygen evolution potential, HO center dot production) of the anodes. The conversion service lifetime of novel anodes were enhanced greatly than the traditional one. Then, we found that Ti-ENTA/SnO2-Sb anode has superior electro-catalytic than Ti-ENTA/SnO2-Sb/PbO2. In the range of current density of 5-20 mA cm(-2), the COD removal rate of ROCs for Ti-ENTA/SnO2-Sb anode and Ti-ENTA/SnO2-Sb/PbO2 anode were 0.12-0.23 mg min(-1) and 0.11-0.19 mg min(-1), respectively. Finally, we comprehensively compared the current efficiency and cost of ROCs degradation among various anodes. It was mentioned that novel anodes require lower energy cost (similar to 6.1 $/kg COD) during electrochemical process. Overall, electrochemical process is a cost-effective process and a very promising technology for practical application.									18	2	0	0	4	0	20			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000561577100001

A series of neodymium (Nd)-doped PbO2 electrodes (Ti/PbO2-Nd) were synthesized through a pulse electrodeposition method, and its activity of bisphenol S (BPS) removal was further examined. The morphologies and structures were characterized by the X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and an energy dispersive spectrometer (EDS). The performance, energy consumption and mechanism of electrochemical oxidation of BPS by Ti/PbO2-Nd electrode were also discussed. Compared to the traditional Ti/PbO2 electrode, the Ti/PbO2-Nd enables finer crystal particles, facilitating the oxygen evolution overpotential (OEP) from 1.41V to 1.55V and the generation of hydroxyl radicals (center dot OH). Moreover, lower duty cycles during the preparation of the electrode also contribute to the tapering size of crystals. The results show that the Ti/PbO2-Nd electrode exhibits relatively high activity in the anodic oxidation of BPS. Over 95% of BPS could be removed with the current density of 15 mA cm(-2). Moreover, the energy consumption of BPS degradation on Ti/PbO2-Nd electrode is 60.26 kWh m(-3), much lower than that on Ti/PbO2 electrode (95.45 kWh m(-3)). To conclude, the Ti/PbO2-Nd electrode has been proven to be a promising material for BPS removal.									9	0	0	0	2	0	9				2073-4441		WOS:000555915200096		
J	Yokota, Kohei; Kanzaki, Yoshiki; Murakami, Takashi				Murakami, Takashi/G-5049-2014	Kanzaki, Yoshiki/0000-0003-1400-1736			Weathering model for the quantification of atmospheric oxygen evolution during the Paleoproterozoic								GEOCHIMICA ET COSMOCHIMICA ACTA				117				332	347		10.1016/j.gca.2013.03.015				SEP 15 2013	2013	A weathering model has been developed to quantify atmospheric oxygen evolution during the Paleoproterozoic. The weathering model calculates the concentrations of Fe2+ dissolved from Fe2+-bearing primary minerals and oxidized Fe3+ out of the dissolved Fe2+ at a given partial pressure of atmospheric oxygen (P-O2) during weathering and establishes the relationships between P-O2 and phi where phi is the ratio of oxidized and then precipitated Fe3+ out of the Fe2+ dissolved from primary minerals to the dissolved Fe2+ in a whole weathering profile. The weathering model considers controlling factors of the redistribution of Fe during weathering, that is, the dissolution rate of Fe2+-bearing primary minerals, the oxidation rate of Fe2+, and the ground-water flow rate. The validity of the model was confirmed by applying the model to the experimental data of olivine dissolution carried out under low O-2 conditions. The sensitivity analysis of the model has revealed that the formation time of weathering, the mineral dissolution rate and the diffusion of O-2 into a weathering profile have no or slight influence on phi, resulting in similar to 0, 0 and 0.3 changes in log(P-O2) caused by four orders of magnitude change of the formation time, more than 10 orders change of the mineral dissolution rate, and assumed change of the O-2 diffusion, respectively. On the other hand, the temperature, the pH and the groundwater flow rate have moderate to large effects on phi: 0.6, 1.4 and 1.5 changes in log(PO2) for changes of 5 degrees C in temperature, 0.5 in pH, and one order of magnitude in groundwater flow rate, respectively. Using possible surface temperature, pH and groundwater flow rate estimated from the literature, we calculated the phi-P-O2 relationships which were then applied to the phi values of paleosols (fossil weathering profiles) formed between 2.5 and 1.8 Ga. Taking account of the constraints given by the records of mass independent fractionation in sulfur isotopes and other geological proxies (i.e., <similar to 10(-6) atm prior to 2.45 Ga, >similar to 10(-6) atm at 2.32 Ga and >similar to 10(-3) atm at 2.0 Ga), our model implies that the P-O2 levels were <10(-6) atm but >10(-9) atm at similar to 2.46 Ga, 10(-4.5)-10(-2) atm at similar to 2.25-2.0 Ga and >10(-2) atm at similar to 1.85 Ga. The present weathering model can constrain P-O2 levels during the possible Paleoproterozoic hot periods but not those during the glacial periods when temperature was <0 degrees C. It has been found that the Cooper Lake, Pronto/NAN, Gaborone and Drakenstein paleosols with ages of similar to 2.5-2.1 Ga did not form under extreme conditions such as those in glacial and hot periods but formed under moderate conditions.

However, its structural and electrical properties remain far from those of the graphene sheets obtained by mechanical exfoliation or by chemical vapor deposition-unless efficient reduction methods that preserve the integrity of the parent carbon-network structure are found. Here, the authors use molecular dynamics and density functional theory calculations to show that the oxygen from the main functional groups present on graphene oxide sheets is removed by the reducing action of carbon monoxide; the energy barriers for reduction by CO are very small and easily overcome at low temperatures. Infrared and Raman spectroscopy experiments confirm the reduction in CO atmosphere and also reveal a strong tendency for CO to heal vacancies in the carbon network. Our results show that reduced graphene oxide with superior properties can be obtained through reduction in CO atmosphere.

The thermal evolution of CaZrO3 dried precursor during heating them up to 1200 degrees C was monitored by thermal (DTA,TG) and X-ray diffraction analysis methods. The highest temperature (1200 degrees C) for CaZrO3 synthesis was found for stoichiometric CaZrO3, whereas introduction of excess CaO into CaZrO3 led to a decrease in the synthesis temperature to 1000 degrees C. The crystallite size d((hki)) of grounded CaZrO3 powders ranged from similar to 43 to similar to 90 nm, respectively. BET measurements indicated that in both the investigated powders, particles were agglomerated. Sintering CaZrO3-based samples at 1500 degrees C/2 h or hot-pressing process (1250 degrees C/1 h, 25MPa) was applied to obtain gas-tight CaZrO3-based ceramics. To examine the thermochemical stability of materials obtained at high temperatures, the CaZrO3-based samples were additionally heated at 1200 degrees C for 120 h or in the temperature range 1400-1600 degrees C for 24 In in air or purified argon. There were also performed and then discussed, some tests on thermal resistance of CaZrO3 against molten metals-nickel and copper. Investigations into chemical reactivity of CaZrO3 electrolyte with electrode materials involving LaCrO3 or MCr2O4 (M = Mg, Ca) in the temperature range 1000-1200 degrees C were conducted using XRD with Rietveld analysis. Electrical conductivity measurements performed by both dc and ac impedance spectroscopy method in the temperature range 200-1000 degrees C. The best oxygen ion conductivity was found for CaZrO3-doped excess CaO (CZ-51) samples sintered in air, starting from powders synthesized by co-precipitation or citrate method. The CZ-51 samples obtained via solid state reaction or hot-pressed exhibited lower values of electrical conductivity. Test results for this compound used as an electrolyte in solid oxide cells involving electrode materials MCr2O4 (M = Mg, Ca) are also reported. In this way the Gibbs free energy of formation of MgCr2O4 at 1000 degrees C was determined. The nonstoichiometric CaZrO3 seems to be a promising solid electrolyte for electrochemical oxygen probes in control of metal processing. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

During the C-F, Al-2(SO4)(3) was used as coagulant and its optimal dose was determined using the jar test. The following operational conditions of C-F, maximizing the organic matter removal, were determined: 700 mg/L of Al-2(SO4)(3) at pH = 9.96. Thus, the C-F allowed to remove 98% of turbidity, 48% of Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD), and let to increase in the BOD5/COD ratio from 0.137 to 0.212. Subsequently, the C-F effluent was treated using each of AOPs. Their performances were optimized by the Response Surface Methodology (RSM) coupled with a Box-Behnken experimental design (BBD). The following optimal conditions of both Fenton (Fe2+/H2O2) and Photo-Fenton (Fe2+/H2O2/UV) processes were found: Fe2+ concentration = 1 mM, H2O2 dose = 2 mL/L (19.6 mM), and pH = 3. The combination of C-F pretreatment with the Fenton reagent, at optimized conditions, let to remove 74% of COD during 90 min of the process. The C-F sequential with Photo-Fenton process let to reach 87% of COD removal, in the same time. Moreover, the BOD5/COD ratio increased from 0.212 to 0.68 and from 0.212 to 0.74 using Fenton and Photo-Fenton processes, respectively. Thus, the enhancement of biodegradability with the physico-chemical treatment was proved. The depletion of H2O2 was monitored during kinetic study. Strategies for improving the reaction efficiency, based on the H2O2 evolution, were also tested. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Once in the gas phase, it can be destroyed by different reactions with atomic and radical species, such as hydroxyl (OH) radicals. The knowledge of the rate coefficients of all these processes at temperatures of the ISM is essential in the accurate interpretation of the observed abundances. In this work, we have determined the rate coefficient for the reaction of OH with CH3CH2OH (k(T)) between 21 and 107 K by employing the pulsed and continuous CRESU (Cinetique de Reaction en Ecoulement Supersonique Uniforme, which means Reaction Kinetics in a Uniform Supersonic Flow) technique. The pulsed laser photolysis technique was used for generating OH radicals, whose time evolution was monitored by laser induced fluorescence. An increase of approximately 4 times was observed for k(21 K) with respect to k(107 K). With respect to k(300 K), the OH-reactivity at 21 K is enhanced by two orders of magnitude. The obtained T-expression in the investigated temperature range is k(T) = (2.1 +/- 0.5) x 10(-11) (T/300 K)(-(0.71 +/- 0.10)) cm(3) molecule(-1) s(-1). In addition, the pressure dependence of k(T) has been investigated at several temperatures between 21 K and 90 K. No pressure dependence of k(T) was observed in the investigated ranges. This may imply that this reaction is purely bimolecular or that the high-pressure limit is reached at the lowest total pressure experimentally accessible in our system. From our results, k(T) at usual IS temperatures (similar to 10-100 K) is confirmed to be very fast. Typical rate coefficients can be considered to range within about 4 x 10(-11) cm(3) molecule(-1) s(-1) at 100 K and around 1 x 10(-19) cm(3) molecule(-1) s(-1) at 20 K. The extrapolation of k at the lowest temperatures of the dense molecular clouds of ISM is also discussed in this paper.									17	0	0	0	0	0	17			1463-9076	1463-9084		WOS:000427085400053	29417104

Here, we demonstrate a general strategy to improve the hydrogen evolution catalysis of metal sulfides by modulating the surface electron densities. The N modulated NiCo2S4 nanowire arrays exhibit an overpotential of 41 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) and a Tafel slope of 37 mV dec(-1), which are very close to the performance of the benchmark Pt/C in alkaline condition. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, synchrotron-based X-ray absorption spectroscopy, and density functional theory studies consistently confirm the surface electron densities of NiCo2S4 have been effectively manipulated by N doping. The capability to modulate the electron densities of the catalytic sites could provide valuable insights for the rational design of highly efficient catalysts for hydrogen evolution and beyond.									280	18	0	0	24	0	281			2041-1723			WOS:000429794300018	29651037	
J	ADELROTH, P; LINDBERG, K; ANDREASSON, LE								STUDIES OF CA2+ BINDING IN SPINACH PHOTOSYSTEM-II USING CA-45(2+)								BIOCHEMISTRY				34	28			9021	9027		10.1021/bi00028a010				JUL 18 1995	1995	The Ca2+-binding properties of photosystem II were investigated with radioactive Ca-45(2+). PS II membranes, isolated from spinach grown on a medium containing Ca-45(2+), contained 1.5 Ca2+ per PS II unit. Approximately half of the incorporated radioactivity was lost after incubation for 30 h in nonradioactive buffer. About 1 Ca2+/PS II bound slowly to Ca2+-depleted membranes in the presence of the extrinsic 16- and 23-kDa polypeptides in parallel with restoration of oxygen-evolving activity. The binding was heterogeneous with dissociation constants of 60 mu M (0.7 Ca2+/PS II) and 1.7 mM (0.3 Ca2+/PS II), respectively, which could reflect different affinities of the dark-stable S-states for Ca2+. The reactivation of oxygen-evolving activity closely followed the binding of Ca2+, showing that a single exchangeable Ca2+ per PS II is sufficient for the water-splitting reaction to function. In PS II, depleted of the 16- and 23-kDa polypeptides, about 0.7 exchangeable Ca2+/PS II binds with a dissociation constant of 26 mu M, while 0.3 Ca2+ binds with a much weaker affinity (K-d > 0.5 mM). The rate of binding of Ca2+ in the absence of the two extrinsic polypeptides was significantly higher than with the polypeptides bound. The rate of dissociation of bound Ca2+ in the dark, which had a half-time of about 80 h in intact PS II, increased in the absence of the 16- and 23-kDa polypeptides and showed a further increase after the additional removal of the 33-kDa protein and manganese. The rate of dissociation was also significantly faster in weak light than in the dark regardless of the presence or absence of the 16- and 23-kDa polypeptides. Removal of the 33-kDa donor-side polypeptide together with the two lighter ones led to a reduction in the amount of bound Ca2+, while practically no Ca2+ bound after treatments to dissociate also the manganese of the water-oxidizing site.									80	3	0	0	63	0	81			0006-2960			WOS:A1995RK55400010	7619801

Nevertheless, for the photocatalytic H-2 evolution reaction (HER), the integrated regulation study on morphology, electronic band structures, and surface active sites of catalyst is still minimal up to now. Herein, well-defined 1D Cd1-xZnxS@O-MoS2/NiOx hybrid nanostructures with enhanced activity and stability for photocatalytic HER are prepared. Interestingly, the band alignments, exposure of active sites, and interfacial charge separation of Cd1-xZnxS@O-MoS2/NiOx are optimized by tuning the Zn-doping content as well as the growth of defect-rich O-MoS2 layer and NiOx nanoparticles, which endow the hybrids with excellent HER performances. Specifically, the visible-light-driven (>420 nm) HER activity of Cd1-xZnxS@O-MoS2/NiOx with 15% Zn-doping and 0.2 wt% O-MoS2 (CZ(0.15)S-0.2M-NiOx) in lactic acid solution (66.08 mmol h(-1) g(-1)) is about 25 times that of Pt loaded CZ(0.15)S, which is further increased to 223.17 mmol h(-1) g(-1) when using Na2S/Na2SO3 as the sacrificial agent. Meanwhile, in Na2S/Na2SO3 solution, the CZ(0.15)S-0.2M-NiOx sample demonstrates an apparent quantum yield of 64.1% at 420 nm and a good stability for HER under long-time illumination. The results presented in this work can be valuable inspirations for the exploitation of advanced materials for energy-related applications.									43	7	0	0	2	0	44			1613-6810	1613-6829		WOS:000477762400003	30645027

In this study, we demonstrate a facile and effective solid phase evolution approach to prepare a highly dispersed PtCu/C catalyst via a surface substitution and etching separation process with the Pt-decorated Cu particles on carbon as the precursors. It is demonstrated that the dispersion of metal nanoparticles in PtCu/C derived from the present solid phase evolution is better than that in PtCu/C (C) prepared from the co-reduction by NaBH4. As a result, the synthesized PtCu/C shows a larger electrochemically active surface area (ECSA) (48.6 m(2) g (1)), higher mass (0.52 mA mu g (1)) and area activities (1.07 mA cm (2)) than that of the PtCu/C (C) (37.9 m(2) g (1), 0.34 mA mu g (1) and 0.89 mA cm (2), respectively). As compared to commercial Pt/C catalyst, PtCu/C exhibits ca. 2.5 times higher formic acid oxidation (FAO) activities (0.52 mA mu g (1) and 1.07 mA cm (2)). The tolerance toward CO poisoning is characterized by CO stripping, the result indicates that both onset (0.43 V) and peak (0.50 V) potentials of PtCu/C for CO oxidation show a negative shift of ca. 70 mV. More significantly, PtCu/C shows high stability in the acid solution, which can maintain 90.1% retention in ECSA after 1000 CV cycles. In addition, the solid separation method offers ease of manipulation, allowing the synthesis of a novel class of highly dispersed binary metal nanoparticles. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Self-promoted Nickel-chalcogenide Nanostructures: A Novel Electrochemical Supercapacitor Device-design Strategy								MATERIALS RESEARCH BULLETIN				156						111975	10.1016/j.materresbull.2022.111975				DEC 2022	2022	Self-grown nickel-chalcogenides viz., sulphide (NiS), selenide (NiSe), and sulfoselenide (NiSSe) nanostructures of aligned nanorod, nanosheet, and nanobud-type morphologies have successfully been synthesized through one -pot hydrothermal synthesis chemical method on 3-D nickel-foam (NiF). The precursors of sulfur and selenium break down into S-2-and Se-2-ions, which on reacting with oxidized Ni2+ ions on the surface of phase-pure NiF produce NiS, NiSe, and NiSSe superstructures. The structural, morphological, and chemical states of the as-grown Ni-based electrodes are monitored through various measurement tools. The as-obtained Ni-based NiS, NiSe and NiSSe electrode materials of various morphologies endow specific capacitances and specific capacities, at 3 A g(-1) current density, of 1683.5 F g(-1), 1563.6 F g(-1), and 3314.9 Fg(- 1) and 187.05, 173.86, and 368.32 mAh g(-1), respectively in a three-electrode system containing 1.0 M KOH electrolyte solution. The NiSSe electrode dem-onstrates the highest specific capacitance and outstanding chemical stability compared to other electrode ma-terials which is attributed to the synergistic effect of two separate metal chalcogenides. In addition, the NiSSe electrode is chemically stable and mechanically robust as it doesn't detach from the conductive NiF substrate even at a high current density. Consequently, the as-designed NiSSe//NiSSe symmetric supercapacitor assembly divulges 1658.6 Wkg(-1) power density and 19.21 Whkg (-1) energy density with the cycling stability of 93.48%. Connecting two cells in a series, a panel "CNED " composed of nearly forty-two LEDs has been ignited with high light intensity, adducing the practical importance of mixed metal chalcogenide electrode material in the energy storage sector.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0025-5408	1873-4227		WOS:000843629300006

This is especially true for the new class of lithium metal chloride (Li-M-Cl) solid electrolytes which are receiving rapidly growing attention due to their very high oxidative stability (>4 V) in combination with good ionic conductivity that can enable long cell cycle life. While Li-M-Cl electrolytes typically contain resource-limited metals (M) such as indium or rare earths, work has focused on substituting M with more abundant elements such as zirconium. Via operando resistance measurements using intermittent current interruption we explore the dynamic evolution of the interphase at the surface of Ni-rich NCM85 or NCM111 cathode particles inside a working SSB with three different Li-(M-1,M-2)-Cl catholytes (Li3InCl6, Li2Sc1/3In1/3Cl4 and Li5/2Y1/2Zr1/2Cl6) to reveal the impact of the cationic metal substitution on the interfacial chemistry. We show that the metal plays a critical role in determining high voltage stability, contrary to prior assumptions. Using a combination of cyclic voltammetry and ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy measurements of the electronic band structure to assess oxidative stability; coupled with DFT calculations and ToF-SIMS to evaluate products formed at the interface at different upper cutoff potentials and degrees of delithiation, we are able to differentiate between electrochemical and chemical degradation. We find that Li2Sc1/3In1/3Cl4 yields the highest (and Li3InCl6 the lowest) stability against electrochemical oxidation, while Li5/2Y1/2Zr1/2Cl6 undergoes a detrimental chemical reaction with oxygen released from Ni-rich NCM85 at high potentials, resulting in fast capacity fading. Overall, our work establishes a platform for the metrics and an approach that can be utilized to efficiently evaluate the stability of new halide SEs in SSB cells.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1754-5692	1754-5706		WOS:000837715400001

In the deepest levels of the Ivrea Mafic Complex, several peridotite-pyroxenite sequences considered of magmatic origin are exposed. We present here a petrological-geochemical investigation of the peridotites from the largest magmatic ultramafic sequence of the Ivrea Mafic Complex, locally called Rocca d'Argimonia. In spite of the widespread subsolidus re-equilibration under granulite facies conditions, most likely reflecting a slow cooling evolution in the lower continental crust, the Rocca d'Argimonia peridotites (dunites to harzburgites and minor clinopyroxene-poor lherzolites) typically retain structures and microstructures of magmatic origin. In particular, the harzburgites and the lherzolites typically show poikilitic orthopyroxenes enclosing partially dissolved olivine and minor spinel. Olivine has forsterite proportion diminishing from the dunites to the harzburgites and the lherzolites (90 mol % to 85 mol %) and negatively correlating with delta O-18 (+5.8 parts per thousand to +6.6 parts per thousand). Gabbronorite dykes locally crosscut the peridotites and show millimetre-scale thick, orthopyroxenite to websterite reaction zones along the contact with host rocks. We propose that the Rocca d'Argimonia peridotites record a process of reactive melt flow through a melt-poor olivine-rich crystal mush or a pre-existing dunite. This process was most likely responsible for the olivine dissolution shown by the poikilitic orthopyroxenes in the harzburgites-lherzolites. We infer that the reactively migrating melts possessed a substantial crustal component and operated at least at the scale of similar to 100 m.									4	0	0	0	1	0	4			0935-1221	1617-4011		WOS:000589261200001

The responses of photosynthesis and respiration were monitored at saturating light intensity of 1000 mu moles m(-2) s(-1) at 25 degrees C under a range of sorbitol concentrations from 0.4 to 1.0 M to induce hyper-osmotic stress and by varying the temperature of the thermo-jacketed pre-incubation chamber from 25 to 10 degrees C to impose sub-optimal temperature stress. Compared to controls (0.4 M sorbitol and 25 degrees C), the mesophyll protoplasts showed remarkable decrease in NaHCO3-dependent O-2 evolution (indicator of photosynthetic carbon assimilation), under both hyper-osmotic (1.0 M sorbitol) and sub-optimal temperature stress conditions (10 degrees C), while the decrease in rates of respiratory O-2 uptake were marginal. The capacity of AOX pathway increased significantly in parallel to increase in intracellular pyruvate and reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels under both hyper-osmotic stress and sub-optimal temperature stress under the background of saturating light. The ratio of redox couple (Malate/OAA) related to malate valve increased in contrast to the ratio of redox couple (GSH/GSSG) related to antioxidative system during hyper-osmotic stress. Further, the ratio of GSH/GSSG decreased in the presence of suboptimal temperature, while the ratio of Malate/OAA showed no visible changes. Also, the redox ratios of pyridine nucleotides increased under hyper-osmotic (NADH/NAD) and sub-optimal temperature (NADPH/NADP) stresses, respectively. However, upon restriction of AOX pathway by using salicylhydroxamic acid (SHAM), the observed changes in NaHCO3-dependent O-2 evolution, cellular ROS, redox ratios of Malate/OAA, NAD(P)H/NAD(P) and GSH/GSSG were further aggravated under stress conditions with concomitant modulations in NADP-MDH and antioxidant enzymes. Taken together, the results indicated the importance of AOX pathway in optimizing photosynthesis under both hyper-osmotic stress and sub-optimal temperatures. Regulation of ROS through redox couples related to malate valve and antioxidant system by AOX pathway to optimize photosynthesis under these stresses are discussed.									37	4	0	0	35	1	40			1664-462X			WOS:000369798200002	26904045

PCPs exhibit unique features such as flexible structures, abundant accessible active sites, and high surface areas. The greatest challenge in the commercialization of 2D PCPs and their nano-composites is achieving a controllable and facile synthesis of 2D PCPs with low cost and high quality. Recently, significant progress has been made in the structural and morphological regulation of 2D PCPs. It is still of considerable significance to further explore the synthetic mechanism and unique properties of 2D PCPs and their nano-composites. In this review, recent research progress in the synthesis of 2D PCP materials and their applications is summarized. Firstly, the development process of 2D PCPs is briefly introduced, and then the synthesis strategy of 2D PCPs and their nano-composites is discussed. Subsequently, the potential applications of 2D PCPs and their nano-composites in electro-catalysis and electronic transport are introduced. Finally, the challenges and prospects for the synthesis and applications of 2D PCPs and their nano-composites are addressed for future developments.									23	3	0	0	0	0	24			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000553632500002

Moreover, the presence of methane has been reported recently in fluid inclusions from a number of reduced porphyry deposits. The genesis of this methane, however, remains poorly understood. Here, we present results of a study of magma-exsolved CH4-rich aqueous fluid inclusions in the Seleteguole reduced porphyry-skam Cu-Mo-Au deposit, NW China. Four types of fluid inclusions, namely intermediate-density two-phase aqueous inclusions, low-density vapor inclusions, brine inclusions and aqueous liquid inclusions, have been distinguished on the basis of the phases present at room temperature. The intermediate-density inclusions were trapped as a single phase and contain 3.8-10.4 mol/kg CH4, corresponding to an oxygen fugacity between Delta FMQ - 1 and Delta FMQ - 0.5. This attests to the remarkably reduced nature of the fluid. The delta C-13 value of the CH4-hosted fluid inclusions ranges from -29.4%o to -19.196o (PDB), which distinguishes this methane from biogenic methane. Indeed, the high homogenization temperature of the CH4-rich inclusions (-400 degrees C) implies that the CH4 was exsolved directly from the magma. Given the environment in which the magma was likely generated, i.e., at or immediately above a subducting plate, we propose that the methane was produced by reactions involving organic matter-bearing carbonate rocks in the subduction zone. Although Cu, Mo and Au in most porphyry systems are interpreted to have been transported under oxidizing conditions, our results indicate that reduced aqueous liquids and vapors are also capable of transporting appreciable concentrations of these metals.									7	0	0	0	0	0	7			0169-1368	1872-7360		WOS:000498306900032

An integrated model was established to predict the spatial distribution of the inclusion composition on the entire cross-section of a heavy rail steel continuous casting, which coupled the heat transfer and solidification of steel during continuous casting, the thermodynamic transformation of inclusions with temperature and the kinetic diffusion of dissolved elements in the steel. Both industrial trials and model predictions achieved similar conclusions.Inclusions within the 30 mm subsurface layer had a similar composition and size to those of the molten steel and were more than other locations of the bloom and at 1/4 thickness of the bloom inclusions were larger and contained the biggest concentration of CaS. Along the thickness of the bloom, an opposite fluctuation of CaO to that of CaS in inclusions existed so that the main reaction between the inclusion and the steel matrix was (CaO) + [S] = (CaS) + [O]. When the cooling rate was larger than 150 K/s, the newly precipitated CaO-Al2O3-MgO-SiO2-(<5 pct CaS) inclusions averaged <1.5 mu m in diameter. If the cooling rate was smaller than 150 K/s, inclusions were transformed to larger CaO-Al2O3-MgO-SiO2-(>10 pct CaS) ones. In order to achieve an optimized composition of inclusions, the total oxygen and aluminum in the steel should be <10 ppm and <40 ppm. (C) 2020 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

S	Villiard, F; Jerkiewicz, G						Jerkiewicz, G; Soriaga, MP; Uosaki, K; Wieckowski, A		Temperature dependence of growth of surface oxide films on rhodium electrodes								SOLID-LIQUID ELECTROCHEMICAL INTERFACES		ACS Symposium Series		656				323	341						1997	1997	Surface oxides on Ph electrodes were formed by anodic polarization at potentials, E-p, between 0.70 and 1.40 V, RHE, with an interval of 0.05 V for polarization times, t(p), up to 10 000 s and at temperatures, T, between 278 and 348 K. This procedure results in thin films having their charge density, q(ox), of less than 1260 mu C cm(-2), thus their thickness, X, of up to 2 ML of Rh(OH)(3). Cyclic-voltammetry, CV, reveals one states, OCl, in the oxide reduction profiles. Increase of T leads to augmentation of the oxide thickness but it does not influence its surface state; thermodynamics of their reduction are not affected by T variation. Plots of q(ox) versus log t(p) or 1/ q(ox) versus log t(p) for a wide range of T and E-p allow one to discriminate between the logarithmic and the inverse-logarithmic oxide growth kinetics. Two kinetic regions are observed in the oxide formation plots, each one giving rise to a distinct growth mechanism. Oxides having X less than or equal to 1 ML of RhOH are formed according to the logarithmic kinetics and the process is limited by the rate of the place exchange between the Ph surface atoms and the electroadsorbed OH groups. Formation of oxides having X between 1 ML of RhOH and 2 ML of Rh(OH)(3) follows the inverse-logarithmic kinetics and the process is limited by the rate of escape of Rh3+ from the metal into the oxide. Theoretical treatment of the data in the region corresponding to X > 1 ML of RhOH leads to determination of the potential drop across the film and the electric field within the oxide layer, the latter being of 10(9) V m(-1).

High temperature treatment in inert atmosphere (pyrolysis) is the essential, most common method for the synthesis of M-N-C catalysts and critical to achieve high electrocatalytic activity and electronic conductivity. To this day, despite many uses and successful implementations in materials manufacturing, pyrolysis has been an entirely empirical technology, with process control and optimization relying exclusively on "Edisonian" approach. The knowledge gap in the mechanism about how the precursor is being transformed into catalysts hinders further development of the M-N-C catalysts regardless of the precursor class and processing protocols. Herein, we probed the morphological evolution and chemical transformation of a nitrogen-containing charge transfer organic salt, mixed with transition metal (iron) salt and amorphous silica powder (precursor) during the pyrolysis process via a combination of in situ synchrotron and laboratory-based diagnostic techniques. The pyrolysis process is found to be divided into three stages. During a controlled temperature ramp, the selected organic N-C precursor (nicarbazin) began melting and decomposing just below 400 degrees C, forming a certain number of micrometer-scale pores and pathways. With increase in temperature from 400 degrees C to 900 degrees C, amorphous carbon domains started forming, and reduced (metallic) iron nanoclusters appeared, being dispersed uniformly throughout the carbonaceous matrix. When temperature advanced above 900 degrees C, graphitization of carbon commenced, associated with appearance and evolution of atomically dispersed metal-nitrogen moieties in the carbonaceous matrix. As the graphitization advanced further, a secondary process of agglomeration of metal nanoparticles occurred. Multi-analytical technique observations conducted here provide a base for rational design and optimization of M-N-C electrocatalysts via pyrolysis.									12	0	0	0	0	0	12			1369-7021	1873-4103		WOS:000686902100011

Rh(110) is susceptible to the well-known missing row (MR) reconstruction. O-2 dosing produces a MR structure and an O-2 coverage of 1/2 monolayer (ML), the latter limited by the kinetics of O-2 dissociation. In contrast, CO dosing retains the (1 x 1) structure and a CO coverage of 1 ML. We show that CO dosing titrates O from the (2 x 1) structure and that the final surface state is a strong function of temperature. Adsorbed CO accelerates and O inhibits the (2 x 1) to (1 x 1) transition, an effect that can be traced to the influence of the adsorbates on the energy landscape for moving metal atoms from filled to empty rows. During simultaneous dosing of CO and O-2, we observed steady-state CO oxidation as well as a transition to the (1 x 1) structure at temperatures more modest than in the titration experiments. This difference may reflect surface heating generated during CO oxidation. At more elevated temperatures the metallic surface transforms to a surface oxide, also active for CO oxidation. Being one of the first examples, these results demonstrate how operando experiment exploration in terms of correlation between surface structure dominated by reaction conditions and activity of a catalytic material and first-principles models can be integrated to disentangle the underlying thermodynamic and kinetic factors that influence the dependence of catalytic activity on surface structure at nano and atomic scales.									14	1	0	0	0	0	14			2155-5435			WOS:000391783200074

Across Nature, their substrate range is vast and exceeds that of other enzymes. The range of different chemical transformations performed by P450s is also substantial, and continues to expand through interrogation of the properties of novel P450s and by protein engineering studies. The ability of P450s to introduce oxygen atoms at specific positions on complex molecules makes these enzymes particularly valuable for applications in synthetic biology. This review focuses on the enzymatic properties and reaction mechanisms of P450 enzymes, and on recent studies that highlight their broad applications in the production of oxychemicals. For selected soluble bacterial P450s (notably the high-activity P450-cytochrome P450 reductase enzyme P450 BM3), variants with a multitude of diverse substrate selectivities have been generated both rationally and by random mutagenesis/directed evolution approaches. This highlights the robustness and malleability of the P450 fold, and the capacity of these biocatalysts to oxidise a wide range of chemical scaffolds. This article reviews recent research on the application of wild-type and engineered P450s in the production of important chemicals, including pharmaceuticals and drug metabolites, steroids and antibiotics. In addition, the properties of unusual members of the P450 superfamily that do not follow the canonical P450 catalytic pathway are described.									151	8	1	0	95	0	169			1367-5931	1879-0402		WOS:000376832800019	27015292	
J	Zhou, Zhenju; Chen, Zhengle; Zhang, Wengao; Huo, Hailong; Liu, Bo; Yan, Qiaojuan; Li, Jilin								Geology, C-H-O isotopes, and muscovite 40Ar-39Ar dating of the Qingbaishan gold deposit: Implications for tectonism and metallogenesis of early Devonian gold deposits in the Beishan orogen, NW China								ORE GEOLOGY REVIEWS				145						104895	10.1016/j.oregeorev.2022.104895				JUN 2022	2022	The Beishan orogen is an economically important gold mineralization belt that hosts more than 20 gold deposits. Most Au orebodies occur within large-scale fault zones, indicating a correlation between structural evolution and gold mineralization. Previous studies have demonstrated that Au mineralization generally developed in the Permian-Triassic; however, pre-Permian gold mineralization and its temporal relationship with tectonic evolution remain poorly understood. The Qingbaishan deposit, located in the Beishan orogen, NW China, is hosted by the Sanjiashan shear zone. A detailed field-based structural analysis revealed that the Sanjiashan shear zone has thrust and sinistral strike-slip characteristics, such as asymmetrical folds and S-C fabrics. The muscovite 40Ar/39Ar age from auriferous quartz shows that the Qingbaishan gold system formed around 399.7 +/- 1.6 Ma, consistent with the time of Sanjiashan sinistral ductile shearing in the Beishan orogen. The carbon and oxygen isotope compositions of auriferous quartz suggest that the host rocks within the Precambrian Gudongjin Group would have been a significant source of ore metals and that the low delta 18O values in quartz resulted from fluid reactions with 18O-poor host rocks. The Qingbaishan Au deposit is concluded to be a strike-slip-dominated orogenic-type system related to continental collision between the Tarim and Kazakhstan-Ili plates. By integrating the age data obtained from this study with previous geochronological results, two episodes of gold mineralization in Beishan are distinguished: an early episode around 399 Ma, when sinistral strike-slip zonerelated orogenic gold deposits formed in a syncollisional setting, and a late episode around 298-231 Ma, when dextral strike-slip deformation produced deposits in a postcollisional extensional setting.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0169-1368	1872-7360		WOS:000798903500002		
J	Li, Yongxia; Yang, Binsheng; Liu, Bin								MOF assisted synthesis of TiO2/Au/Fe2O3 hybrids with enhanced photocatalytic hydrogen production and simultaneous removal of toxic phenolic compounds								JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR LIQUIDS				322						114815	10.1016/j.molliq.2020.114815				JAN 15 2021	2021	The heterojunction photocatalyst namely TiO2/Fe2O3 modified with different Au loadings has been constructed via a one-pot metal-organic framework (MOF) route which using titanium (IV) butoxide and iron nitrate as precursors. The characteristics studies show that the nano-shaped TiO2 is spreaded uniformly on the surface of Fe2O3 along with Au deposition. The noble Au metal acts as an electron mediator which has been enabled in enhancing the photocatalytic performances of TiO2/Fe2O3 heterojunction. The photocatalytic ability was evaluated through the H-2 production (using water-splitting reaction) and removal of phenolic compounds namely 2,4 dichlorophenol (2,4-DCP) and 4-bromophenol (4,B,-P) under the largely available visible light in solar spectrum. The highest H-2 production of 590 mu mol g(-1) h(-1), with an apparent quantum yield of 12%, was obtained using the glycerol as sacrificial reagent using 4% Au-Fe2O3/TiO2 photocatalyst. By examining the special impact of different scavengers, it paraded that the hydroxyl and superoxide radicals mainly participated in the photocatalysis process. The combined effect of TiO2 and Fe2O3 and effective Au deposition lead to an upgraded carrier separation efficiency and outstanding photocatalytic performances. Furthermore, the close interface formed by metallic Au material pointedly slows down the recombination of e /r, which is high advantageous for the photocatalytic processes using naturally available sunlight or visible-light. This work delivers a novel perception to develop a stable noble-metal photocatalyst material in the H-2 production and the removal of phenolic compounds in the industrial areas.

J	Wang, Yajing; Du, Chunyu; Sun, Yongrong; Han, Guokang; Kong, Fanpeng; Yin, Geping; Gao, Yunzhi; Song, Ying								The Enhanced CO Tolerance of Platinum Supported on FeP Nanosheet for Superior Catalytic Activity Toward Methanol Oxidation								ELECTROCHIMICA ACTA				254				36	43		10.1016/j.electacta.2017.09.099				NOV 10 2017	2017	The inferior CO-like intermediates tolerance of Pt nanoparticle greatly hampered the MOR activity and durability. To alleviate this issue, tremendous efforts have been made to create oxygen-containing groups on neighbouring Pt site for oxidizing the poisonous carbonaceous species. Given this, two-dimensional FeP nanosheet with excellent HER activity was utilized as support and cocatalyst. FeP nanosheet with special Fe delta+ and P-delta active sites was conductive to mass transfer, fast charge transfer and facilitating water dissociation for generating OH species to removal CO-like intermediates on Pt sites. The XRD, XPS, SEM and TEM analysis demonstrated that the Pt nanoparticle with an average size of 3.68 nm was successfully deposited on the FeP nanosheet surface. The methanol oxidation experiments in acidic medium revealed that the as-prepared binary Pt/FeP nanosheet hybrid exhibited superior MOR activity with enhanced anodic peak current density of 0.994 mA/cm(2), which was 2.74-fold greater than that of commercial Pt/C, and the intensive CO oxidation peak potential was negatively shifted about 100 mV with respect to that of Pt/C. The better CO tolerance of Pt/FeP nanosheet hybrid might be attributed to cooperative effect from down-shifted d-band center of Pt, abundant hydroxyls on the Pt/FeP and special activity of Fe delta+ and P-delta. In addition, this hybrid electrocatalyst also showed relatively higher HER activity compared with that of Pt/C. This study provides a promising application of metal phosphide in methanol oxidation for enhancing CO resistance capability of Pt-based catalyst. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Understanding the complete dynamic response of surface structure and chemistry to thermal treatments at the atomic scale is imperative for the rational design of catalyst nanoparticles. Here, by tracking the same individual Pt3Co nanoparticles during in situ annealing in a scanning transmission electron microscope, we directly discern five distinct stages of surface elemental rearrangements in Pt3Co nanoparticles at the atomic scale: initial random (alloy) elemental distribution; surface platinum-skin-layer formation; nucleation of structurally ordered domains; ordered framework development and, finally, initiation of amorphization. Furthermore, a comprehensive interplay among phase evolution, surface faceting and elemental inter-diffusion is revealed, and supported by atomistic simulations. This work may pave the way towards designing catalysts through post-synthesis annealing for optimized catalytic performance.									134	4	0	0	14	0	133			2041-1723			WOS:000366379400007	26576477

Alkaline water electrolysis systems face a daunting challenge in terms of stabilizing hydrogen production under the condition of transient start-up/shut-down operation. Herein, we present a simple but effective solution for the electrode degradation problem induced by the reverse-current under transient power condition based on a fundamental understanding of the degradation mechanism of nickel (Ni). It was clearly demonstrated that the Ni cathode was irreversibly oxidized to either the beta-Ni(OH)(2) or NiO phases by the reverse-current flow after shut-down, resulting in severe electrode degradation. It was also determined that the potential of the Ni electrode should be maintained below 0.6 VRHE under the transient condition to keep a reversible nickel phase and an activity for the hydrogen evolution reaction. We suggest a cathodic protection approach in which the potential of the Ni electrode is maintained below 0.6 VRHE by the dissolution of a sacrificial metal to satisfy the above requirement; irreversible oxidization of the cathode is prevented by connecting a sacrificial anode to the Ni cathode. In the accelerated durability test under a simulated reverse-current condition, lead was found to be the most promising candidate for the sacrificial metal, as it is cost effective and demonstrates chemical stability in the alkaline media. A newly defined metric, a reverse-current stability factor, highlights that our system for protecting the cathode against the reverse-current is an efficient strategy for stable and cost effective alkaline production.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0				2691-3704		WOS:000849810100001

Here, the relationship between the growth behavior of Li2O2 on the surface of the carbon nanotube (CNT) cathodes and the cycle performance of LOBs was innovatively revealed based on molecular dynamics (MD) and density functional theory (DFT). Our results demonstrated that the growth of (Li2O2)(n) on the CNT surface mainly undergoes three stages: adhesion, branching, and connection. The stable gap between (Li2O2)(n) and the CNT surface was determined to he approximately 2.47 A. Interestingly, the dense deposition thickness is positively correlated with the number of Li2O2 monomers. In addition, the formation of free Li(2)O(2 )directly induces the instability of (Li2O2)(n) and capacity loss. Moreover, armchair-type CNTs with larger diameters, especially single-walled CNTs and multi-walled CNTs with an odd number of tube walls were found to be more conducive to the stable growth of discharge products. Notably, (Li2O2)(n) is mainly composed of internal stable parts with low conductivity and amorphous components distributed on the surface with p-type semiconductor characteristics. Therefore, the regulation of the CNT structure and the preparation of catalysts to promote the conversion of Li2O2 from an ordered state to an amorphous structure play a vital role in breaking the technical bottleneck of LOBs. Our results identify the long-term controversial evolution mechanism of the product morphology, and the unique calculation ideas are also applicable to the intuitive exploration of the microscopic growth behavior of discharge products in other metal-air batteries.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			2155-5435			WOS:000813342000001

THE LUMENAL INTERHELICAL DOMAINS OF THE D1 POLYPEPTIDE								BIOCHEMISTRY				34	17			5839	5858		10.1021/bi00017a016				MAY 2 1995	1995	To identify amino acid residues that ligate the manganese and calcium ions of photosystem II or that are otherwise crucial to water oxidation, site-directed mutations were constructed in the unicellular cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 at all conserved carboxylate, histidine, and tyrosine residues in the lumenal interhelical domains of the DI polypeptide. Mutants with impaired photoautotrophic growth or oxygen evolution were characterized in vivo by measuring changes in the yield of variable chlorophyll a fluorescence after a saturating flash or brief illumination given in the presence of an electron-transfer inhibitor or following each in a series of saturating flashes given in the absence of inhibitor [Chu, H.-A., Nguyen, A. P., and Debus, R. J. (1994) Biochemistry 33, 6137-6149]. Mutants were also characterized after propagation in media having other cations substituted for calcium. We conclude that Asp-59 and Asp-61 may ligate calcium, that Asp-59, Asp-61, Glu-65, and His-92 influence the properties of the manganese cluster without significantly affecting its stability or ability to assemble, that Glu-189 plays an important structural role in maintaining the catalytic efficiency of the Mn cluster and partly influences the cluster's stability or ability to assemble, that His-92 and Glu-189 influence the binding of calcium, and that His-190 strongly influences the redox properties of the secondary electron donor, Y-Z(OX), and either ligates manganese or serves as a crucial base or hydrogen bond donor. In addition, we conclude that Asp-170 may ligate manganese, but that its replacement with Val, Leu, or Ile causes structural perturbations that partly compensate for the loss of the carboxylate moiety.									189	3	0	0	149	0	192			0006-2960			WOS:A1995QW14600016	7727445

The morphology and microstructure of the HfC-SiC coating were analyzed by X-ray diffraction and scanning electron microscopy. The results showed that Hf and Si elements distributed uniformly in the coating and the coating was dense without crack. Ablation resistance test was processed by oxyacetylene torch. During the ablation process, the sintering rate of HfO2 was slow, and more oxygen diffused into the internal coating, which caused the oxidation of the internal coating and damaged the structure of internal coating in the ablation center region. In addition, during cooling process, a new phase HfSiO4 was generated by the reaction between HfO2 and SiO2, which acted as a pinning agent to prevent the further expansion of the crack.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			0963-6935	2633-366X		WOS:000490181900001

In this paper, the short-term effect of incident light fluctuations on the oxygen production by the microalga Scenedesmus obtusiusculus cultivated in a 20 L air-lift photobioreactor was performed at different operation times under nitrogen-replete or nitrogen-starved conditions. It was possible to reach steady states in the oxygen production indicating short-term photosynthetic acclimation and the highest values during the incremental light step-changes were between 103 and 207 mg(o2) g(b)(-1) h(-1) for light intensities between 141 and 505 mu mol m(-2) s(-1) at 0.13 g(b) L-1. The photosynthetic response was not symmetric in the increase/decrease light step-changes due to temperature variations caused by the illumination system. Moreover, in nitrogen-starved conditions the dynamic photosynthetic response was slower than in nitrogen-replete levels declining to 70% at 0.5 g(b) L-1 at the maximum light intensity. Furthermore, a mathematical model was developed to estimate the dynamic oxygen response and the biomass productivity. The simulations predicted the highest O-2 concentrations at 35 degrees C and irradiances above 600 mu mol m(-2) s(-1) and the highest biomass productivity was 0.78 g(b) L-1 d(-1).

J	Chaussidon, Marc; Libourel, Guy; Krot, Alexander N.				Chaussidon, Marc/E-7067-2017				Oxygen isotopic constraints on the origin of magnesian chondrules and on the gaseous reservoirs in the early Solar System								GEOCHIMICA ET COSMOCHIMICA ACTA				72	7			1924	1938		10.1016/j.gca.2008.01.015				APR 1 2008	2008	We report in situ ion microprobe analyses of the oxygen isotopic composition of the major silicate phases (olivine, low-Ca pyroxene, silica, and mesostasis) of 37 magnesian porphyritic (type 1) chondrules from CV (Vigarano USNM 477-2, Vigarano UH5, Mokoia, and Efremovka) and CR (EET 92042, EET 92147, EET 87770, El Djouf 001, MAC 87320, and GRA 95229) carbonaceous chondrites. In spite of significant variations of the modal proportions of major mineral phases in CR and CV chondrules. the same isotopic characteristics are observed: (i) olivines are isotopically homogeneous at the parts per thousand level within a chondrule although they may vary significantly from one chondrule to another, (ii) low-Ca pyroxenes are also isotopically homogeneous but systematically O-16-depleted relative to olivines of the same chondrule, and (iii) all chondrule minerals analyzed show O-16-enrichments relative to the terrestrial mass fractionation line, enrichments that decrease from olivine (+/- spinel) to low-Ca pyroxene and to silica and mesostasis. The observation that, in most of the type I chondrules studied, the coexisting olivine and pyroxene crystals and glassy mesostasis have different oxygen isotopic compositions implies that the olivine and pyroxene grains are not co-magmatic and that the glassy mesostasis is not the parent liquid of the olivine. The delta O-18 and delta O-17 values of pyroxene and olivine appear to be strongly correlated for all the studied CR and CV chondrules according to:delta O-18((pyroxene)) = 0.72(-016)(+0.13) x delta O-18((olivine)) + 1.21(-0.54)(+0.79)delta O-17((pyroxene)) = 0.81(-015)(+0.13) x delta O-17((olivine)) + 0.60(-1.00)(+0.95)These correlations are consistent with mass balance of oxygen isotopes calculated in the case of chondrule formation according to the following gas-melt-mineral reactions:Mg2SiO4(olivine) + SiO2(melt) Mg(2)Si2O(6(pyroxene))SiO2(melt) = SiO(gas) + 1/2 x O-2(gas)These equations imply that 2/3 of the oxygen incorporated by low-Ca pyroxene during its crystallization in the melt is derived from the dissolution of precursor olivine and 1/3 from the addition of chemical components such as SiO from the nebular gas. The composition of the nebular gaseous reservoir in which type I CR and CV chondrules formed is determined from the present data set to be delta O-18((gas)) similar to 3.6 +/- 1 parts per thousand and delta O-17((gas)) similar to 1.8 +/- 1 parts per thousand. This isotopic composition is in excellent agreement with that of the gaseous reservoir previously inferred from the oxygen isotope systematics of bulk chondrules from various chondrite groups (i.e., CV, CR, unequilibrated ordinary, and EH). Thus, the oxygen isotopic systematic strongly supports the idea that most of the olivines in type I chondrules are relict grains and that gas-melt interaction played a major role in the formation of type I chondrules.

To that goal, hydrogen is presumed to be the most promising energy carrier. Electrocatalytic water splitting, if driven by green electricity, would provide hydrogen with minimal CO2 footprint. The viability of water electrolysis still hinges on the availability of durable earth-abundant electrocatalyst materials and the overall process efficiency. This review spans from the fundamentals of electrocatalytically initiated water splitting to the very latest scientific findings from university and institutional research, also covering specifications and special features of the current industrial processes and those processes currently being tested in large-scale applications. Recently developed strategies are described for the optimisation and discovery of active and durable materials for electrodes that ever-increasingly harness first-principles calculations and machine learning. In addition, a technoeconomic analysis of water electrolysis is included that allows an assessment of the extent to which a large-scale implementation of water splitting can help to combat climate change. This review article is intended to cross-pollinate and strengthen efforts from fundamental understanding to technical implementation and to improve the 'junctions' between the field's physical chemists, materials scientists and engineers, as well as stimulate much-needed exchange among these groups on challenges encountered in the different domains.									9	0	0	0	0	0	9			0306-0012	1460-4744		WOS:000807747800001	35575644	
J	Rostami, S.; Seriani, N.; Gebauer, R.								Hematite surfaces: Band bending and local electronic states								PHYSICAL REVIEW MATERIALS				6	10					104604	10.1103/PhysRevMaterials.6.104604				OCT 10 2022	2022	Hematite is a promising material for photoelectrochemical water splitting applications and understanding the complete mechanism of water oxidation reaction close to its surfaces is of great importance. Herein, we present a theoretical investigation of the electronic states of nonstoichiometric hematite(0001) films in the presence of absorbed H on the surfaces, as well as Ti doping. The calculations, performed at the DFT + U level, indicate that iron can appear in different oxidation states, from Fe2+ to Fe4+ and Fe5+ in the vicinity of impurities or surfaces. The electron and hole distributions in hematite slabs could control the bending and local state of valence and conduction bands. The projected density of states in different atomic positions shows an upward band bending close to the surfaces, which varies with the number of absorbed H or with Ti doping. In the dark, the width of the depletion layer is computed as less than 12 angstrom for neutral slabs, while adding excess electrons expands it to involve more atomic layers, depending on the number of absorbed H on the surface. In the neutral slabs in the presence of H, we obtain an upward band bending of 0.18, 0.42, and 0.24 eV by increasing the number of H from one to three on each side, respectively. The evolution of bands in neutral slabs, with/without Ti doping, occurs in a few layers in nearby the surface and also Fe with an oxidation state rather than Fe3+. According to our results, doping Ti creates a polaron and locally affects the band structure. In the charged surface with excess electrons, a metallic behavior is observed on the surface and a large band bending in the middle layers. This work shows that a substantial upward bending of the bands in hematite can exist even at neutral surfaces in contact with a vacuum.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2475-9953			WOS:000871073400006		
J	Ma, Pengjie; Lin, Chengyan; Jahren, Jens; Dong, Chunmei; Ren, Lihua; Hellevang, Helge					Ma, Pengjie/0000-0002-4766-1936			Cyclic zoning in authigenic saddle dolomite-ankerite: Indications of a complex interplay between fault-rupturing and diagenetic alteration								CHEMICAL GEOLOGY				559						119831	10.1016/j.chemgeo.2020.119831				JAN 5 2021	2021	Zoned authigenic minerals reflect temporal changes in fluid composition and can shed light on the dynamic evolution of sedimentary systems. The chemistry of the zoned saddle dolomite-ankerite from the Bohai Bay Basin, China, changes in a cyclic way from core to rim, reflecting a dynamic system perturbated several times from thermodynamic steady-state. The distribution of the dolomite-ankerite close to faults suggests that the cyclic evolution may be related to the faulting. Oxygen isotope ratios, relatively high precipitation temperatures (80-160 degrees C), and association with late-stage pyrite cementation, suggest that dolomite-ankerite formation may be connected to thermochemical sulphate reduction within the hydrocarbon reservoir. The chemical zones alternate between low and high Fe-content, and show evidence of corrosion before each growth stage. The complex relation between the silicate, carbonate, and sulphur/sulphide systems can be explained in terms of open-system diagenesis, where fault rupturing triggers an influx of CO2 and thermogenic H2S. Pyrite scavenges both H2S and Fe, until all H2S is exhausted, and the aqueous Fe then builds up again from slow silicate dissolution. The Fe-content of dolomite-ankerite growth after such a perturbation therefore depends on the rate of Fe-supply from the silicate dissolution, and the length of time between the chemical perturbations. If such a relation exists between time and the coupled mineral reactions, then the Fe-content of the carbonates may provide an indication of the length of time between the fault-triggered chemical perturbations of a system. This must be regarded as a working hypothesis for further detailed studies on the relation between faulting and the silicate-sulphur/sulphide-carbonate system.									8	1	0	0	0	0	9			0009-2541	1872-6836		WOS:000600546500004

These catalysts contained different molar ratios of Ce, Cu, and Fe, and were applied to the process of NO catalytic removal by CO (CO-deNO). The physical and chemical parameters of the samples were characterized by XRD, XPS, ESR, H-2-TPR, NO-TPO, and NO-TPD techniques. Moreover, the CO-deNO mechanisms for the representative catalysts were investigated by in situ DRIFTS. The SO2 and H2O resistances, and their corresponding mechanisms, were also systematically investigated. The catalytic activity testing shows that the optimized molar ratio of Cu, Ce, and Fe is 1:0.5:1.5. At this ratio, the CO-deNO efficiency is highest, but the N2O selectivity is also relatively high. Increasing the Fe percentage could reduce the N2O concentration. The characterization indicates that, at the optimized ratio, the interaction between Fe and Cu is at its strongest, which could increase the formation probability of surface synergistic oxygen vacancies. The Ce existing in the catalysts plays a key role in the adsorption of NO and CO. Moreover, the increasing percentage of Fe could enhance the adsorption and dissociation of NO, and promote the evolution of CO, which can compensate for the effects of the weaker interaction. The NO and CO evolution pathway runs as follows: NO -> M-NO2 -> NO2- -> M-N2O/NO3- -> N2O/N-2; CO -> COO- -> CO32- -> CO2. The H2O and SO2 resistance tests suggest that the appropriate incremental increase in Fe percentage will increase the SO2 or H2O resistance, with the underlying mechanism being that Fe inhibits the formation of sulfates and produces more water adsorption sites, and the increasing Fe percentage would optimize the pore structure.									6	0	0	0	1	0	6			0887-0624	1520-5029		WOS:000499741900126

Therefore, surface modifications, such as coatings, have been widely used to improve battery performance. Understanding how these coatings function to improve battery performance is crucial for both scientific research and applications. In this study the electrochemical performance of coated and uncoated LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4 (LNMO) electrodes is correlated with ensemble-averaged soft X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) and spatially resolved scanning transmission electron microscopy-electron energy loss spectroscopy (STEM-EELS) to illustrate the mechanism of how ultrathin layer Al2O3 coatings improve the cycle life of LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4. Mn2+ evolution on the surface is clearly observed in the uncoated sample, which results from the reaction between the electrolytic solution and the surfaces of LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4 particles, and also possibly atomic structure reconstructions and oxygen loss from the surface region in LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4. The coating effectively suppresses Mn2+ evolution and improves the battery performance by decelerating the impedance buildup from the surface passivation. This study demonstrates the importance of combining ensemble-averaged techniques (e.g., XAS) with localized techniques (e.g., STEM-EELS), as the latter may yield unrepresentative information due to the limited number of studied particles, and sheds light on the design of future coating processes and materials.									32	3	0	0	2	0	32			1616-301X	1616-3028		WOS:000394681900002

Here, we report Pt catalysts with not only high activity but also high durability. This was achieved by the electrodeposition of Pt crystal aggregates with a porous structure on a carbon nanotube film. Accelerated degradation testing shows that the new catalysts degrade very little even after 8000 potential cycles under harsh cycling conditions, while the typical commercial Pt/C catalyst loses most of its activity in the first 1000 cycles. Based on the microstructure evolution and electrochemical evidence, the outstanding durability is attributed to the faceted nanocrystals and their interconnected porous network, both of which limit the pathways for Pt dissolution, migration, and agglomeration. The technique reported here provides new opportunities for developing next-generation electrocatalysts for promoting their real applications in many devices.									7	0	0	0	0	0	7			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000352441100025

An assessment of the influence of different experimental parameters on the amount of incorporated Co was made for PbO2 films grown either at constant current or constant potential. The Co content in PbO2 decreases with increasing temperature and pH of the deposition solution, probably due to the fact that increasing the growth electrolyte temperature from 25 to 65 degreesC causes a decrease of the deposition potential from 1.5 to 1.4 V. Similarly, a rise of the electrolyte pH brings about a decrease of the electrodeposition potential. The same electrodeposition kinetics are obeyed in the absence and in the presence of Co2+ in solution. In the potential region where the Pb(II) oxidation becomes diffusion controlled, the corresponding limiting current decreases when Co2+ is present. This is due to an enhancement of the parallel O-2 evolution process. Experiments showed that Co2+ is weakly adsorbed on PbO2, and that the adsorption follows Langmuir conditions. Surface analysis by XRD and XPS of the Co-doped PbO2 films does not reveal major changes compared to undoped samples. Tritium radiotracer experiments show that the effect of Co-doping on incorporation of protons is appreciable in films deposited at relatively high temperature (65 degreesC). In this case, as a function of electrodeposition time, the amount of incorporated tritium first increases then decreases to the same value measured for undoped PbO2. This behaviour is likely to be due to substitution of Pb(IV) with Co(II) followed by oxidation of the incorporated Co(II) to Co(III) as electrodeposition proceeds.

RUSSIAN JOURNAL OF ELECTROCHEMISTRY				55	6			479	487		10.1134/S1023193519060107				JUN 2019	2019	The approaches to increasing the efficiency of lithium-oxygen battery (LOB), which are based on the use of PtCo/carbon nanotubes (CNT) catalyst and iodine-containing liquid-phase mediator, are compared. It is found that, when 1 M LiClO4/DMSO electrolyte is used, the 20PtCo/CNT catalyst provides an increase of the capacity of a Swagelok LOB model in the complete discharge to a voltage of 2 V as compared to the CNT-based LOB. During the cycling of LOB with each of the materials, the charging voltage increases to 4.5 V. This leads not only to an increase in the rate of electrochemical oxidation of lithium peroxide, but also to an acceleration of corrosion of the electrolyte and active material. In the presence of iodine compounds in the electrolyte, Li2O2 is oxidized by the chemical mechanism, which reduces the charging voltage. In the 0.05 M LiI + 1 M LiClO4/DMSO electrolyte, 85 successive cycles were obtained at a capacity of 500mA h/g(C) in the LOB discharging stage and a final charging voltage of not more than 3.8 V. When scaling the LOB to the size of the positive electrode (5 x 5 cm(2)), the complete discharge capacity close to this characteristic of Swagelok model (as calculated for the geometric electrode surface area) was reached. An introduction of iodine-containing additive into the electrolyte enabled us to obtain up to 100 cycles at a capacity of 300 mA h/g(C). The results of the work show that the use of iodine-based redox mediator is more effective from the viewpoint of stability of characteristics of LOB of this type as compared with the use of the platinum-containing catalyst.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			1023-1935	1608-3342		WOS:000476524300001

However, the insufficient visible light absorption and fast charge recombination of carbon nitride have limited its practical application. Herein, the self-assembly carbon nitride (denoted as TCN) by molecular doping copolymerization of urea and 2-thiobarbitucid acid (TA) was prepared. XPS and elemental analytical results indicated that TA was doped in the framework of carbon nitride successfully. The self-assembly copolymerization would result in the change of morphology, intrinsic electron and band structure of carbon nitride. Theoretical calculations and experiments confirm that the band gap of TCN could be adjusted by changing the amount of 2-thiobarbitucid acid. Moreover, the efficiency of charge carrier transfer and separation was greatly enhanced. As a result, the optimized photocatalyst TCN-0.03 exhibited superior activity with a high reaction rate of 0.058 min(-1) for the degradation of sulfamethazine under visible light irradiation, which is 4.2 times higher than that of urea based carbon nitride (U-CN). As a multifunctional photocatalyst, TCN-0.03 showed enhanced activity for hydrogen production (55 mu mol h(-1)), which was 11 times higher than UCN. The apparent quantum efficiency reached to 4.8% at 420 nm. A possible mechanism was proposed to explain the photocatalytic reaction process. This work provides insight into the rational design of modified carbon nitride by other organic monomers copolymerization to enhance the photocatalytic activity.									151	1	0	0	49	0	151			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000454137400019

For this to happen the performance of the AEM electrolyzer must match the compact design, stability, H-2 purity and high current densities of PEM systems. Current research aims at bringing AEM water electrolysis technology to an advanced level in terms of electrolysis cell performance. Such technological advances must be accompanied by demonstration of the cost advantages of AEM systems. The current state of the art in AEM water electrolysis is defined by sporadic reports in the academic literature mostly dealing with catalyst or membrane development. The development of this technology requires a future roadmap for systematic development and commercialization of AEM systems and components. This will include basic and applied research, technology development & integration, and testing at a laboratory scale of small demonstration units (AEM electrolyzer shortstacks) that can be used to validate the technology (from TRL 2-3 currently to TRL 4-5). This review paper gathers together recent important research in critical materials development (catalysts, membranes and MEAs) and operating conditions (electrolyte composition, cell temperature, performance achievements). The aim of this review is to identify the current level of materials development and where improvements are required in order to demonstrate the feasibility of the technology. Once the challenges of materials development are overcome, AEM water electrolysis can drive the future use of hydrogen as an energy storage vector on a large scale (GW) especially in developing countries.									133	4	0	0	7	0	136			2398-4902			WOS:000534220100003

The strategy included hydrothermal synthesis of Ni-P spheres with large Ni surface layer on carbon cloth (Ni-P@Ni HL/CC) and subsequent chemical dealloying using HCl as etching solution in order to remove the redundant Ni substances. The morphology, composition, and electrochemical performances of raw Ni-P@Ni HL/CC and the corresponding samples obtained by different dealloying times (0.5, 1, and 2 h) were characterized. Interestingly, the Ni-P@Ni HL/CC-1h presents a unique structure with a nanoflake shell and a porous core, which can provide a large number of exposed active sites, accelerate electrolyte ion diffusion and support ultra-long cycling. Furthermore, the Ni species existing in the outer flake can increase the conductivity and promote the capacitance during the charge-discharge processes. The Ni-P@Ni HL/CC-1h exhibited high specific capacity of 280.8 C g(-1) at current density of 1 mA cm(-2), high rate retention of 76.2% at 20 mA cm(-2). The maximum specific capacity could reach 388.8 C g(-1) at 8 mA cm(-2), and maintained the 92.6% retention after 3000 cycles. Moreover, the Ni-P@Ni HL/CC-1h//AC all-solid-state asymmetric supercapacitor (ASC) exhibited high specific capacity, 86.0% retention after 10,000 cycles and high energy density of 27.6 Wh kg(-1) at power density of 942.8 W kg(-1).									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			0957-4522	1573-482X		WOS:000490120000059

Such mergers constitute a significant fraction, and may even dominate, the inspiral rates of all WD-NS binaries. We post-process our simulations to obtain the nuclear evolution of these systems and couple the results to a supernova spectral synthesis code to obtain the first light curves and spectra for these transients. We find that the amount of Ni-56 synthesized in these mergers grows as a strong function of the WD mass, reaching typically 0.05 and up to 0.1 M-circle dot per merger. Photodisintegration leads to similar amounts of He-4 and about a ten times smaller amount of H-1. The nuclear yields from these mergers, in particular those of Mn-55, may contribute significantly to Galactic chemical evolution. The transients expected from ONe WD-NS mergers are dominantly red/infrared, evolve on month-long time-scales and reach bolometric magnitudes of up to -16.5. The current surveys must have already detected these transients or are, alternatively, putting strong constraints on merger scenarios. The properties of the expected transients from WD-NS mergers best agree with faint type Lax supernovae. The Vera Rubin Observatory (LSST) will be detecting up to thousands of merging ONe WD-NS systems per year. We simulate a subset of our models with 2D axisymmetric FLASH code to investigate why they have been challenging for previous studies. We find that the likely main challenge has been effectively modelling the nuclear statistical equilibrium regime in such mergers.									7	0	0	0	0	0	7			0035-8711	1365-2966		WOS:000749577000043

The simple surface modification of g-C3N4 by hydrothermal methods improves photocatalytic performance. In this study, ethanol is used as a solvothermal solvent to modify the surface properties of g-C3N4 for the first time. The g-C3N4 is thermally treated in ethanol at different temperatures (T = 140 degrees C, 160 degrees C, 180 degrees C, and 220 degrees C), and the Pt co-catalyst is subsequently deposited on the g-C3N4 via a photodeposition method. Elemental analysis and XPS O 1s data confirm that the ethanol solvothermal treatment increased the contents of the oxygen-containing functional groups on the g-C3N4 and were proportional to the treatment temperatures. However, the XPS Pt 4f data show that the Pt2+/Pt-0 value for the Pt/g-C3N4 treated at ethanol solvothermal temperature of 160 degrees C (Pt/CN-160) is the highest at 7.03, implying the highest hydrogen production rate of Pt/CN-160 is at 492.3 mu mol g(-1) h(-1) because the PtO phase is favorable for the water adsorption and hydrogen desorption in the hydrogen evolution process. In addition, the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy data and the photoluminescence spectra emission peak intensify reflect that the Pt/CN-160 had a more efficient charge separation process that also enhanced the photocatalytic activity.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2				2079-4991		WOS:000747798500001	35055198

We have chosen a model photocatalyst consisting of Ni/NiO core-shell co-catalyst loaded on a SrTiO3(STO) light-harvesting semiconductor, since this type of core-shell structure loaded on semiconductor has previously shown overall water splitting. Photocatalytic water splitting offers a promising pathway for the generation of solar fuel, H2.

J	Cao Chun-mei; Ding Qing-wei								The Influence of Oxygen on NO Removal by Non-equilibrium Plasma								Electric Power				47	7			134	6, 149						5 July 2014	2014	On the basis of the physical and chemical models of NO in non-equilibrium plasma based gas removal system NO-N2, the numerical simulation of NO removal process is conducted under different O2 initial concentrations to study the evolution of NO and NO2 concentrations varying with time. The influence of O2 initial concentration on the concentrations of main particles and NO removal is studied. The calculation results show that the presence of O2 has negative impacts on NO removal by non-equilibrium plasma. The NO removal efficiency reduces in the presence of O2. The higher concentration of O2 will lead to more decrease of NO removal efficiency. The adding of O2 increases the NO2 production as the result of the coexistence of non-equilibrium.									0	0	0		0	0	0			1004-9649			INSPEC:14943003

The product distribution in liquid hydrocarbons produced by FT synthesis has strong dependence on the CO/H-2 ratio of the syngas feedstock. Herein, we demonstrated the feasibility of tuning the CO/H-2 ratio at a wide range by developing nanoparticle-assisted Ni-Co binary single-atom catalysts for electrocatalytic production of syngas. By controlling the elemental proportion of Ni-Co in the composite catalysts, electrochemical reduction of CO2 to syngas with a tunable CO/H-2 ratio from 0.3 to 27.6 was achieved. For the binary catalysts with a Ni-Co ratio of 1:1, the CO/H-2 ratio maintains at 1.3-1.5 in a broad potential range from -0.59 to -0.83 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) and the total current density reaches similar to 32.2 mA/cm(2) at -1.0 V versus RHE. The promotion effect of nanoparticles on Ni-Co single-atom catalysts was validated by partial removal of nanoparticles and further density functional theory (DFT) calculations. As revealed by DFT calculations, nanoparticles incorporated in single-atom sites take essential roles in facilitating the adsorption of CO2 and the formation of *COOH. The origin of CO2RR and hydrogen evolution reaction reactivities can be identified as Ni-N-4 and Co-N-4 single-atom sites, respectively. The dual active sites allow the facile control of the CO/H-2 ratio of electrochemical converted syngas, and it will be beneficial to downstream production of diverse chemicals.									5	1	0	0	0	0	5			2574-0962			WOS:000703338600092

Owing to various limitations, i.e. insufficient surface area, active sites, charge isolation, high overpotential, etc. associated with a single photoactive semiconductor, it is challenging to convert adsorbed H2O and CO2 to CO, H-2, CH4, CH3 OH, O-2, etc. by harvesting solar light. Among popular cocatalysts, earth-abundant cocatalysts exhibited great potential in the area of photocatalysis and are highly significant in accelerating reaction kinetics happening on the surface of semiconductors. Recently, other than the costly noble metals cocatalysts, earth-abundant cobalt based materials can be used as efficient cocatalysts, which effectively amended the photoactivity of photoactive semiconductors by forming stable junctions. Herein, in this all-inclusive review, the recent progress in cobalt based materials as cocatalysts applied in photocatalytic CO2 conversion and water splitting are concisely summarized. Special emphasis is placed on the surface modification principle, design strategies, and loading techniques for further amending the redox potentials of cobalt based cocatalysts for energy applications. Particularly, five types of amendment stratagems based on enhanced solar energy harvesting accelerated charge tunneling, exposed active centers, strengthened photostability, and lowered overpotential have been extensively highlighted and summarized. Typically, the anchoring of both reductive and oxidative (dual) cocatalysts have been explored, which depicted the synergistic behaviour of dual cocatalysts in amending surface properties for improving the photocatalytic CO2 reduction, H-2 and O-2 generation. Finally, this review addresses the emerging current perspectives as an insight into future research directions in this field to develop more efficient cocatalysts which effectively helped in the mitigation of energy and environmental issues.

The H2O2 is formed at the graphite felt cathodes by reducing O-2 provided from the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) performed at the Ti vertical bar IrO2-Ta2O5 anodes. This electrolyzer avoids employing an air compressor to supply the O-2 for the electrosynthesis of H2O2 during the E-peroxone process. The characterization of E-peroxone was performed by using 2 L of a solution containing 0.05 M Na2SO4 at concentrations of CAP from 20 to 50 mg L-1 TOC (48.9-122.3 mg L-1 CAP), studying the influence of pH (3-9), applied current density (5 <= j <= 15 mA cm(-2)), and solution flow rate (0.4 <= Q <= 1.0 L min(-1)) on the oxidation of CAP. The best performance reached 100% CAP degradation, 63% TOC removal, at pH 3, j = 10 mA cm(-2), Q = 0.4 L min(-1) and F-O3 = 17.5 mg min(-1). The mineralization current efficiency (MCE) and electrolytic energy consumption (EC) were 19% and 0.202 kWh (g TOC)(-1), respectively. The comparison of E-peroxone with anodic oxidation aided by H2O2 (AO-H2O2) and ozonation showed the oxidative power sequence E-peroxone ozonation > AO-H2O2. The evolution of car-boxylic acids and inorganic ions was performed by chromatographic and spectrophotometric techniques. Finally, a route of CAP degradation is proposed.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			1383-5866	1873-3794		WOS:000720836400006

Herein, we demonstrate the activity of molybdenum oxide (MoO2)-embedded cobalt oxalate (CoC2O4 center dot 2H(2)O) nanostructures for the OER process. The excellent performance of the microrod-like MoO2/CoC2O4 center dot 2H(2)O composite is reflected in just 330 mV overpotential for 10 mA/cm(geo)(2), low Tafel slope (78 mV/dec), 90% faradaic efficiency, and 24 h stability in 1.0 (M) KOH. The as-prepared electrocatalyst requires a significantly lower overpotential wrt CoC2O4 center dot 2H(2)O. Incorporation of MoO2 elegantly modified the textural property, such as surface area and porosity, of the as-prepared material. Furthermore, MoO2/CoC2O4 center dot 2H(2)O was found to follow the proton-decoupled electron-transfer mechanism for electrocatalyzing OER. Postcatalytic characterization revealed the electrochemical transformation of a one-dimensional (1-D) MoO2/CoC2O4 center dot 2H(2)O microrod into a sheetlike two-dimensional alpha-Co(OH)(2)/CoOOH during alkaline OER. Interestingly, postcatalytic X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, inductively coupled plasma, and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy analyses suggest MoO2 etching from the material, leading to exposure of a higher number of electrochemically active sites that otherwise lay inactive because of their presence in the bulk. Both CoC2O4 center dot 2H(2)O- and MoO2/CoC2O4 center dot 2H(2)O-integrated 1-D nanostructures showed an similar to 0.01 s(-1) turnover frequency value at 400 mV overpotential. We believe that the enhancement in geometrical electrocatalytic activity is not due to the direct participation of MoO2 in catalysis but due to its electrochemical etching, which makes a higher number of catalytically active sites accessible to the electrolyte. This study conveys the in situ electrochemical activation strategy through etching of pore additive for the alkaline OER process.									11	0	0	0	0	0	11			1932-7447	1932-7455		WOS:000574908200016

The different behaviours were compared and the degradation characteristics were determined for each fuel. Then a kinetic study was performed. Simple modelling of the thermal degradation was carried out with a global scheme. These results were compared with current kinetic models used in forest fire modelling. These methods predict the mass rate evolution globally. However, they do not describe the fluctuations well owing to the different pyrolysis steps. Next, the kinetic parameters were established in function of the degree of conversion with isoconversion methods for each fuel. The results calculated by the Friedman method were compared with the experimental results, showing good agreement. These data, which take into account the degree of conversion and the fuel, can be useful to model the burning rate of forest fuels.									7	0	0	0	2	1	8			1049-8001			WOS:000290222200007

Algal hydrogenase (HydA, encoded by HYDA) is in charge of catalyzing the reaction: 2H(+) -> 2e(-) <-> H-2 but usually inhibited by O-2, a byproduct of photosynthesis. The aim of this study was to knockdown PsbO (encoded by psbO), a subunit concerned with O-2 evolution, so that it would lead to HydA induction. The alga, Chlorella sp. DT, was then transformed with short interference RNA antisense-psbO (siRNA-psbO) fragments. The algal mutants were selected by checking for the existence of siRNA-psbO fragments in their genomes and the low amount of PsbO proteins. The HYDA transcription and the HydA expression were observed in the PsbO-knockdown mutants. Under semi-aerobic condition, PsbO-knockdown mutants could photobiologically produce H-2 which increased by as much as 10-fold in comparison to the wild type. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

The MnO/CoMn2O4@N-C nanorods feature a MnO nanorod core with CoMn2O4 nanoparticle interstitial decoration, both coated by an N-C conductive shell. The MnO core renders Mn active sites and oxygen vacancies, while the CoMn2O4 interstitial decoration gives additional Mn, Co active sites, thereby enhancing bifunctional electrocatalytic ORR-OER. The N-C shell increases electronic conductivity, hierarchical porosity, specific surface area, and protects the core and interstitial decoration against lithium peroxide (Li2O2) passivation. The improved structural features allow the MnO/CoMn2O4@N-C nanorod cathode-based LOB cells to exhibit superior full specific discharge capacity of 8,625 mAh.g(-1) and cyclability of 48 discharge-charge cycles at 200 mA.g(-1) specific current and 2000 mAhg(-1) limited specific discharge capacity compared to their alpha-MnO2 nanorod counterparts. An ORR-OER mechanism is proposed to describe the interesting formation of particle- and film-type Li2O2 deposits at different cycles for the MnO/CoMn2O4@N-C nanorod cathodes. Such MOF-derived, interstitial nanoparticle-decorated nanoarchitectures can lead to high-performance tunable bifunctional electrocatalysts. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Wang Changjian; Guo Changming; Xu Shengli; Zhang Hanhong								Experimental investigation on gaseous detonation propagation through a T-shape bifurcated tube								Acta Mechanica Sinica				36	1			16	23						Jan. 2004	2004	The gaseous detonation of 2H2/O2/Ar mixture propagation through a T-shape bifurcated tube with a square cross-section 40 mmtimes40 mm has been experimentally studied in this paper. The pressure histories at the specific ports were recorded by piezo-electric transducers and cellular patterns around the T-shape were recorded by smoked foils respectively. The average velocity of detonation and the cell evolution were obtained. Experimental results indicate that the detonation wave is strongly weakened by the geometry around the T-shape tube. The interactions of leading shock and transverse waves contribute to the traveling characteristics of detonation. In the downstream region far away from 3.5 to 6 times the tube cross-section size, a secondary steady detonation wave is re-established accompanying the appearance of regular cellular structures with the same sizes as the previous one. The cellular patterns also demonstrate the phenomena of diffraction, regular and Mach reflections of gaseous detonation. In the pass-by tube, it is noted that the cellular structure disappears in the region just downstream the start of the T-shape due to the separation of leading shock and reaction zone. With the propagation and reflection of the leading shock in the pass-by tube, the re-initiation occurs in the separated region between the leading shock and reaction zone. The re-initiation can be demonstrated by the clustered cellular structures on the smoked-foils, and it is critical in re-establishing of gaseous detonation here. As the initial pressure decreases to 2.00 kPa, the steady detonation can be re-established in downstream region, but detonation extinguishes in the bifurcated tube. Also, based on the smoked foil records, several characteristic lengths and angles were measured and the initial pressure influences on them were analyzed.									2	6	0	0	0	0	8			0459-1879			INSPEC:8691303

Carbon dioxide chemisorption per m2 of the samples increases exponentially with NaOH loading within the range 0-7.8 wt.%, but catalytic activity correlates more closely to the basic strength than to the total number of basic centers. The activity of Na-13X for this reaction is moderate and stable, while lightly doped 13X samples (3.8 wt.% NaOH) have a high initial activity, which decays to a low, stable value within an hour. A more heavily doped sample (7.8 wt.% NaOH), which is actually composed of NaAlSiO4 and Na2O . Al2O3 . SiO2, gave a low but stable activity. Calcium-5A zeolite with 3.3 wt.% residual Na has a relatively high initial activity, which decays gradually. Basic strengths of the chemical entities involved were estimated by the partial charge of their oxygen anions. From the calculated partial charges and activity measurements, it was inferred that free Na2O and NaOH are highly active and responsible for the high initial activity, which decays rapidly owing to the formation of HCOONa. Sodium zeolites and aluminosilicates are moderately active and responsible for the low, stable activity. Water is a strong poison that probably blocks the strongly basic O2- sites with its H+ ion or H2O dipole and also catalyzes the formation of HCOONa. But the relatively weak basic sites, responsible for the low but stable activity, are not blocked. The lag of the CO evolution behind methanol under TPD conditions and the simultaneous evolution of CO and methanol under continuous-flow or frontal conditions, are even more conspicuous here than in the case of NaOH/MgO. Explicit schemes for two concurrent mechanisms of methyl formate decomposition on the basic catalysts are proposed.									14	0	0	0	1	0	14			0304-5102			WOS:A1993KQ71200012

Based on textural observations and orthopyroxene compositions, two different lithologies were determined: harzburgitic and orthopyroxenitic. The orthopyroxenitic lithology contains orthopyroxene (Mg no. 73.99-75.68) and spinel (Cr no. 83.09-85.11, Mg no. 15.57-22.45). On the other hand, the harzburgitic lithology contains orthopyroxene (Mg no. 74.54-77.14) and olivine (Mg no. 70.94-72.57). The iron metal and the sulfides (Troilites) of this sample are present in both lithologies and are low in Ni (Ni<0.1wt%). The Fe/Mn ratio of orthopyroxenes ranges from 22.28 to 32.64 and show a large overlap between both lithologies. Lowest ratios are unusual; they are below the defined field for diogenites and olivine diogenites. O-17 values are -0.234 +/- 0.003 (1 sigma) and confirm that the NWA 4255 originated from 4Vesta. The results of this study show that there is a genetic linkage between the two lithologies of NWA 4255 and correspond to in situ crystallization processes. This olivine diogenite reflects transition between two major magmatic processes in 4Vesta. The magma ocean of 4Vesta crystallized at equilibrium, allowing the formation of a dunitic and harzburgitic mantle. This late lithology is linked to the peritectic reaction between the olivines formed and the evolved liquid. Our sample then reflects this crucial step of separating this mantle from the residual liquid. This melt evolving on the peritectic allowed the formation of the observed harzburgitic assemblage and then evolves out from the peritectic reaction to proceed to a fractional crystallization process involving the formation of orthopyroxenite.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1866-7511	1866-7538		WOS:000475699500009

First, the carbons' hierarchical pore structure and specific surface area were tweaked by controlling the temperature and sequence of the thermal treatments. The best process (pyrolysis at 900 degrees C, washing, and subsequent annealing at 1000 degrees C) yielded a carbon with a specific capacitance of 117Fg(-1)nearly double that of a carbon made by a typical single-step synthesis at 700 degrees C. Following the structural optimization, the surface chemistry of the carbons was enriched by applying an oxidation routine based on a mixture of nitric and sulfuric acid in a 1:4 ratio at two different treatment temperatures (0 and 20 degrees C) and different treatment times. The optimal treatment times were 4h at 0 degrees C and only 1h at 20 degrees C. Overall, the specific capacitance nearly tripled relative to the original carbon, reaching 168Fg(-1). The inherent nitrogen doping of the carbon comes into interplay with the acid-induced surface functionalization, creating a mixture of oxygen- and nitrogen-oxygen functionalities. The evolution of the surface chemistry was carefully followed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and by N-2 sorption porosimetry, revealing stepwise surface functionalization and simultaneous carbon etching. Overall, these processes are responsible for the peak-shaped capacitance trends in the carbons.									29	2	0	0	1	0	29			1864-5631	1864-564X		WOS:000413565100011	28586123

Recently, two-dimensional (2D) materials, especially those based upon transition metal dichalcogenides such as molybdenum disulfide (MoS2), have gained attention for the catalysis of hydrogen production because of their exceptional properties. Innovative strategies have been developed to engineer these material systems for improvements in their catalytic activity. Toward this aim, the facile growth of MoS2 clusters by sulfurization of molybdenum dioxide (MoO2) particles supported on reduced graphene oxide (rGO) foams using the chemical vapor deposition (CVD) method is reported. This approach created various morphologies of MoS2 with large edges and defect densities on the basal plane of rGO supported MoS2 structures, which are considered as active sites for HER catalysis. In addition, MoS2 nanostructures on the surface of the porous rGO network show robust physical interactions, such as van der Waals and pi-pi interactions between MoS 2 and rGO. These features result in an improved process to yield a suitable HER catalyst. In order to gain a better understanding of the improvement of this MoS2-based HER catalyst, fully atomistic molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of different defect geometries were also performed.									58	2	0	0	1	0	59			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000526543400025	32045208

The as synthesized materials were further subjected to chemical exfoliation using hydrochloric acid as exfoliating agent. The different physicochemical properties of the synthesized materials were well characterized by means of Powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD), UV-Visible diffuse reflectance absorption spectra (UV-DRS), photoluminescence spectra (PL), and electrochemical measurement. Boron doping into the bulk CN lattice enhance the absorption of light, electron-hole separation as revealed from absorption and PL emission spectra. From the photocurrent and impedance spectra it is clear that boron doping not only enhances the photocurrent value but also decreases the charge transfer resistance of the parent material. All synthesised materials were tested for photocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction, out of which CNB shows highest rate of hydrogen generation (18.2 mu molh(-1)) which is around three times more than that of g-C3N4.

J	Teolis, B. D.; Waite, J. H.								Dione and Rhea seasonal exospheres revealed by Cassini CAPS and INMS								ICARUS				272				277	289		10.1016/j.icarus.2016.02.031				JUL 1 2016	2016	A Dione O-2 and CO2 exosphere of similar composition and density to Rhea's is confirmed by Cassini spacecraft Ion Neutral Mass Spectrometer (INMS) flyby data. INMS results from three Dione and two Rhea flybys show exospheric spatial and temporal variability indicative of seasonal exospheres, modulated by winter polar gas adsorption and desorption at the equinoxes. Cassini Plasma Spectrometer (CAPS) pickup ion fluxes also show exospheric structure and evolution at Rhea consistent with INMS, after taking into consideration the anticipated charge exchange, electron impact, and photo-ionization rates. Data-model comparisons show the exospheric evolution to be consistent with polar frost diffusion into the surface regolith, which limits surface exposure and loss of the winter frost cap by sputtering. Implied O-2 source rates of similar to 45(7) x 10(21) s(-1) at Dione(Rhea) are similar to 50(300) times less than expected from known O-2 radiolysis yields from ion-irradiated pure water ice measured in the laboratory, ruling out secondary sputtering as a major exospheric contributor, and implying a nanometer scale surface refractory lag layer consisting of concentrated carbonaceous impurities. We estimate similar to 30:1(2:1) relative O-2:CO2 source rates at Dione(Rhea), consistent with a stoichiometric bulk composition below the lag layer of 0.01(0.13) C atoms per H2O molecule, deriving from endogenic constituents, implanted micrometeoritic organics, and (in particular at Dione) exogenous H2O delivery by E-ring grains. Impact deposition, gardening and vaporization may thereby control the global O-2 source rates by fresh H2O ice exposure to surface radiolysis and trapped oxidant ejection. (C) 2016 The Authors.

J	DELRIEU, MJ; ROSENGARD, F								EVENTS NEAR THE REACTION-CENTER IN O-2 EVOLVING PS-II ENRICHED THYLAKOID MEMBRANES - THE PRESENCE OF AN ELECTRIC-FIELD DURING THE S(2) STATE IN A POPULATION OF CENTERS								PHOTOSYNTHESIS RESEARCH				37	3			205	215		10.1007/BF00032824				SEP 1993	1993	Flash-induced absorption changes at 515 nm observed as a function of flash number are examined in relation to the flash-induced fluorescence yields in inside-out thylakoids. After partial dissipation of the delocalized transmembrane electric field by adding gramicidin, the analysis of period 4 oscillations and of the kinetics in the 10 ms-1 s range suggest that the variation of the absorption changes at 515 nm as a function of flash number is the result of at least two processes: 1) an electric field increase related to the S2 state and 2) the fact that the field generated by the water protons inside the membrane decreases when these protons are released outside the membrane. The former field correlates with the flash-induced fluorescence yield increase induced by the donor side of Photosystem II. Both measurements show similar oscillations as a function of flash number, with maxima on the lst, 5th and 9th flash. These oscillations, after a shift of two flashes, appear to be different from those of the O2 yield observed under similar conditions. It is proposed that, in a population of centers the electric field during the S2 state reflects the presence of a stabilized positive equivalent in the protein close to the Mn complex.									6	0	0	0	6	0	6			0166-8595			WOS:A1993MC24300003	24317801

Although significant progress has been achieved, realizing efficient H-2 & nbsp;evolution reaction (HER) with non-noble-metal photocatalysts is still challenging. Herein, we report a facile synthesis of Mo2C-CdS-Co@C heterojunction by anchoring CdS and Mo2C nanoparticles onto Co@C micro-flowers. The Co@C micro-flowers were composed of graphitic carbon nanoflakes partially embedded with Co, CoOx, Co9S8 nanocrystals and obtained through the carbonization of metanilic-anion intercalated Co(OH)(2) precursor. Due to excellent visible-light harvesting capacity, efficient charge transmission and isolation caused by the existence of superior electron mediator (graphitic carbon) together with oxidation (CoOx) and reduction (Co, Co9S8, Mo2C) cocatalysts, as well as the plentiful H-2-evolving active sites originating from the metal (Co), metal sulfide (Co9S8), and metal carbide (Mo2C), the Mo2C-CdS-Co@C hybrid micro-flowers delivered an exceptional HER (lambda & nbsp;> 400 nm) activity of 760.58 mu mol h(-1) (10 mg), approximately 32 and 15 folds that of pristine CdS and platinum (3 wt%)-decorated CdS, respectively. Moreover, both the cycling and long-term photocatalytic tests confirm that the Mo2C-CdS-Co@C possesses an outstanding durability for H-2 & nbsp;production. The study results might inspire the rational integration of cocatalysts to simultaneously optimize the charge trapping and H-2 & nbsp;evolving kinetics for strengthening the photocatalytic HER activity efficiently.

Herein, multicomponent uniform 3D PtCoRh highly branched nanoassemblies (HBNAs) were prepared by glycine-assisted one-pot solvothermal method in oleylamine (OAm). The effects of the precursor types, reaction time and amount of glycine were critically investigated in this synthesis. The as-prepared PtCoRh HBNAs displayed outstanding electrocatalytic activity and improved stability towards ethanol oxidation reaction (EOR) and methanol oxidation reaction (MOR) in 1 M KOH electrolyte, whose mass/specific activities were 1.75 A mg(-1)/4.03 mA cm(-2) and 0.98 A mg(-1)/2.34 mA cm(-2), respectively, which were remarkably higher than commercial Pt/C (0.85 A mg(-1)/4.03 mA cm(-2) and 0.47 A mg(-1)/0.89 mA cm(-2)). This study provides some novel guidelines to fabricate advanced multimetallic electrocatalysts for practical applications in direct alcohol fuel cells (DAFCs). (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Although photosynthetically produced "O-2 oases" have been proposed for the photic zone of the oceans prior to the GOE, it has been difficult to constrain absolute O-2 concentrations and fluxes in such paleoenvironments. Here we constrain free O-2 levels in the photic zone of a Late Archean marine basin by the combined use of Fe and Mo isotope systematics of Ca-Mg carbonates and shales from the 2.68 to 2.50 Ga Campbellrand-Malmani carbonate platform of the Kaapvaal Craton in South Africa. Correlated Fe and Mo isotope compositions require a key role for Fe oxide precipitation via oxidation of aqueous Fe(II) by photosynthetically-derived O-2, followed by sorption of aqueous Mo to the newly formed Fe oxides. A dispersion/reaction model illustrates the effects of Fe oxide production and Mo sorption to Fe oxides, and suggests that a few to a few tens of mu M free O-2 was available in the photic zone of the Late Archean marine basin, consistent with some previous estimates. The coupling of Fe and Mo isotope systematics provides a unique view into the processes that occurred in the ancient shallow ocean after production of free O-2 began, but prior to oxygenation of the deep ocean, or significant accumulation of free O-2 in the atmosphere. These results require oxygenic photosynthesis to have evolved by at least 2.7 Ga and suggest that the Neoarchean ocean may have had a different oxygenation history than that of the atmosphere. The data also suggest that the extensive iron formation deposition that occurred during this time was unlikely to have been produced by anoxygenic photosynthetic Fe(II) oxidation. Finally, these data indicate that the ocean had significant amounts of O-2 at least 150 Myr prior to previously proposed "whiffs" of O-2 at the Archean to Proterozoic transition.

In this study two different reactors were tested: a medium concentrating radiation system (Heliomans, HM) and a non-concentrating radiation system (CPC). Their advantages and disadvantages for p-NTS degradation have been compared and discussed. The degradation rates obtained in the CPC collector are around three times more efficient than in the HM collectors. However, in both systems, 100% of the initial concentration of p-NTS was removed. Kinetic experiments were performed in both systems using TiO2 suspensions. During the photodegradation, the disappearance of p-NTS was followed by HPLC, the mineralization of the solution by the TOC technique, the evolution of NO3-, NO2- and SO4= concentration by ionic chromatography, the toxicity by the standard Microtox (R) test, and the biodegradability by BOD, and COD measurements. The obtained results demonstrated the utility of the heterogeneous catalysis (using TiO2 as catalyst) as a pretreatment method that can be followed by a biological process.					2nd International Conference on Oxidation Technologies for Water and Wastewater Treatment2nd International Conference on Oxidation Technologies for Water and Wastewater Treatment	MAY 28-31, 2000MAY 28-31, 2000	Int Wate AssocInt Wate Assoc	CLAUSTHAL ZELLERF, GERMANYCLAUSTHAL ZELLERF, GERMANY	24	1	0	0	6	0	24			0273-1223			WOS:000172095300030	11695462	
P	YANG J; YANG P; FAN H								Zinc electrode used for aqueous zinc batteries of electronic product energy storage technologies, comprises zinc battery cathode, connecting layer and negative electric framework hydrogel					CN113745675-A	SINO-SINGAPORE INT JOINT RES INST																			NOVELTY - The zinc electrode has a zinc battery negative electrode, a connecting layer and a negatively charged skeleton hydrogel all arranged from inside to outside. The negatively charged skeleton hydrogel is a hydrophilic porous hydrogel with negatively charged skeleton. The negatively charged skeleton hydrogel is a thin layer with zinc-philic properties. The thickness of the thin layer is 50 microns to 1 mm, and the zinc ion adsorption energy of the thin layer is greater than 1.2 eV. The connecting layer is used to construct the strong binding energy of the negatively charged skeleton hydrogel and the negative electrode of the zinc battery to improve the free energy of the interface. The vertical growth of zinc deposition is inhibited, and the lateral growth of zinc deposition is promoted. The connecting layer controls the low-activity water molecules on the near surface of the negative electrode to prevent the hydrogel layer from peeling off. USE - Zinc electrode protected by negatively charged skeleton hydrogel as modified layer used for aqueous zinc batteries of electronic product energy storage technologies. ADVANTAGE - The zinc electrode uses inexpensive materials, has simple structure, and is reusable, which can be used in the field of battery stability and safety. The connecting layer always controls the low activity water molecule on the near surface of the cathode, thus preventing the exfoliation of the hydrogel layer, and improving the whole stability of the electrode surface structure. The zinc ion adsorption energy of the thin layer is more than 1.2eV, which is good for the embedding of the zinc ion. The conductance of the hydrogel modified layer is higher, and the surface is compact with very few occurrences of microcracks, which effectively limits hydrogen evolution reaction. DETAILED DESCRIPTION - An INDEPENDENT CLAIM is included for a method for preparing a zinc electrode protected by a negatively charged skeleton hydrogel as a modified layer, which involves cleaning the negative electrode of zinc battery in oxygen plasma, soaking the negative electrode of the zinc battery in the silane coupling agent for 2-4 hours, the negative electrode of the zinc battery grows a thin layer of negatively charged skeleton hydrogel with zinc-philic properties, which is washed with ethanol and deionized water, and dried for use, putting the negatively charged skeleton hydrogel into the mold filled with electrolyte solution for 2-4 hours, putting the mold into a drying box, pass nitrogen for 2-4 minutes and curing with an ultraviolet lamp for 3-5 hours.

The interactions between the fracking fluids and the reservoir rocks may increase the flowback and produced (FP) salinity, rendering the fluid ineffective for reuse and recycling. To explore the function of polyacrylamide (PAM; a widely applied friction-reducing additive) on the evolution of FP water salinity, three fluid-rock interaction experiments were conducted under relevant temperature conditions. Sr concentrations and Sr-87/Sr-86 were measured to identify mineral exchanges. Results showed that the dominant geochemical reactions were pyrite oxidation, carbonate, and silicate mineral dissolution, and halite dissolution; the hydrolysis of polyacrylamide facilitated mineral dissolution. Another one-tenth of carbonate was mobilized and the total oxidized pyrite mass was nearly 30 times greater on the function of PAM. These findings imply that the development of brine-tolerant polyacrylamide is necessary to effectively reuse and recycle FP water. This is beneficial for the environment as this minimizes the dependency on freshwater supplies. This study provides new information on the interactions between the fracturing fluid and the reservoir rocks and further elucidates the influence of polyacrylamide on wastewater salinity.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0883-2927	1872-9134		WOS:000587914200001

To obtain pure hydrogen, researches are focused on the electrolysis of water. One of the most important parts of these studies is to develop cathode material. In this study, electrodes are prepared by rolling slurry contained copper (I) oxide (Cu2O) and nickel (II) oxide (NiO) on a graphite support material. Then, iron (Fe) is electrochemically deposited on the prepared electrode. Finally, ruthenium (Ru) is doped electrochemically. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, cyclic voltammetry, chronoamperometry, and linear sweep voltammetry techniques are taken for each electrode. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and X-ray diffraction analyses are performed for surface characterization. SEM pictogram shows the snowflake-like structure for the best catalyst. It is found that the best molar ratio for Cu2O-NiO is 2:1, the best deposition times are 10 minutes and 30 seconds for Fe and Ru, respectively.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			0363-907X	1099-114X		WOS:000600576800001

Among TMOs, tungsten oxides have attracted considerable attention owing to their excellent electron transport properties and good resilience to photocorrosion in aqueous media. However, pristine WO3 exhibits low photocatalytic activity because of the rapid recombination of its photo-generated charge-carriers and its narrow photo-absorption range. Consequently, the monoclinic oxygen-deficient (WO3-delta) material W18O49 (congruent to WO2.73) has attracted greater interest than typical tungsten oxides due to its high chemical stability and large number of oxygen vacancies (OVs). In particular, the water splitting efficiency of W18O49 is enhanced by doping with Mo, which modifies the intrinsic chemical properties of W18O49 without disturbing the crystal structure while producing more active sites. Furthermore, by tuning the morphology of Mo-W18O49 (MWO), the photocatalytic activity of MWO-embedded CdS was greatly enhanced by the very large surface area and supplementary active sites. To that end, we developed an urchin-type MWO cocatalyst integrated into CdS nanorods (NRs) by simple methods. The catalyst exhibits an enhanced production rate of H-2 (40.225 mmol h(-1) g(-1)) under simulated solar light irradiation, which is 20 times higher than that of pristine CdS NRs. The urchin-type morphology significantly shortens charge-carrier transport distances. The oxygen deficiency and Mo dopant in the W18O49 system also improve the number of active sites, which promotes the efficient utilization of light, excellent electron-transport properties, and good resilience to photocorrosion. These properties are especially beneficial for the effective excitation and separation of charge-carriers that are directed to the reduction of protons to H-2. Moreover, to the best of our knowledge, this material exhibits the best performance among reported tungsten-based oxides as a cocatalyst on CdS composites.									20	1	0	0	1	0	20			2044-4753	2044-4761		WOS:000432082800011

A powder containing ZnO spheres, with diameters between 100 to 200 nm and formed by aggregation of ZnO nanoparticles, was also obtained as a secondary reaction product. The samples were studied by scanning electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction and photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy. The effects of the [diethanolamine]/[Zn2+] molar ratio on morphological, structural and optical properties were studied, as well as the effect of laser illumination (lambda = 325 nm) and annealing treatment on photoluminescence properties. The film samples exhibited a compact columnar structure, with thickness between 180 to 210 nm, which were not strongly affected by the diethanolamine concentration. The X-ray diffraction patterns from the films evidenced preferred orientation along the c-axis of the ZnO wurzite structure; while the nanospheres did not show any preferential crystalline direction. The PL spectra from the films showed large initial UV emission and a weak defect band centered in the yellow. A PL evolution while the samples were UV illuminated was observed. The relaxation of metastable phases (formed during the low temperature growth) involving the creation of point defects, is suggested. The predominance of the yellow defect band before and after treatment points at oxygen vacancies as the possible point-defect candidate.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			2053-1591			WOS:000445133900003

Here, authors prepare nickel-cobalt single-atom dimers as high-performance pH-universal H-2 evolution electrocatalysts.Single-atom-catalysts (SACs) afford a fascinating activity with respect to other nanomaterials for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), yet the simplicity of single-atom center limits its further modification and utilization. Obtaining bimetallic single-atom-dimer (SAD) structures can reform the electronic structure of SACs with added atomic-level synergistic effect, further improving HER kinetics beyond SACs. However, the synthesis and identification of such SAD structure remains conceptually challenging. Herein, systematic first-principle screening reveals that the synergistic interaction at the NiCo-SAD atomic interface can upshift the d-band center, thereby, facilitate rapid water-dissociation and optimal proton adsorption, accelerating alkaline/acidic HER kinetics. Inspired by theoretical predictions, we develop a facile strategy to obtain NiCo-SAD on N-doped carbon (NiCo-SAD-NC) via in-situ trapping of metal ions followed by pyrolysis with precisely controlled N-moieties. X-ray absorption spectroscopy indicates the emergence of Ni-Co coordination at the atomic-level. The obtained NiCo-SAD-NC exhibits exceptional pH-universal HER-activity, demanding only 54.7 and 61 mV overpotentials at -10 mA cm(-2) in acidic and alkaline media, respectively. This work provides a facile synthetic strategy for SAD catalysts and sheds light on the fundamentals of structure-activity relationships for future applications.									28	1	0	0	2	0	27				2041-1723		WOS:000720682600010	34799571

As its active sites catalyse the Volmer hydrogen adsorption step, it is particularly active in acidic media. This study focused on the electrochemical deposition of MoS2 on copper foam electrodes and the characterisation of their electrocatalytic properties. In addition, the electrodeposition was modified by adding a reducing agent-sodium hypophosphite-to the electrolyte. To reveal the role of hypophosphite, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis was carried out in addition to scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX). MoS2 films, electrodeposited at various charges passed through the cell (catalyst loadings), were tested for their catalytic activity towards hydrogen evolution in 0.5 M H2SO4. Polarisation curves and Tafel slope analysis revealed that the electrodeposited MoS2 films are highly active. Namely, Tafel slopes fell within the 40-50 mV dec(-1) range. The behaviour of as-deposited films was also evaluated by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy over a wide overpotential range (0 to -0.3 V), and two clear time constants were distinguished. Through equivalent electrical circuit analysis, the experimental data were fitted to the appropriate model, and the obtained values of the circuit components were examined as a function of overpotential. It was found that the addition of NaH2PO2 into the electrodeposition solution affects the intrinsic activity of the material. Finally, a method is proposed to approximate the number of active sites from impedance data.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4				2073-4344		WOS:000584225500001

Similar to photosynthesis in plants, the CO2 molecules are reduced by electrons and protons, which are extracted from H2O molecules, to produce O2. This reaction is uphill; therefore, the solar energy is stored as the chemical bonding energy in the organic molecules. This artificial photosynthetic technology mimicking green vegetation should be implemented as a self-standing system for on-site direct solar energy storage that supports CO2 recycling in a circular economy. Herein, we explain our interdisciplinary fusion methodology to develop hybrid photocatalysts and photoelectrodes for an artificial photosynthetic system for the CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) in aqueous solutions. The key factor for the system is the integration of uniquely different functions of molecular transition-metal complexes and solid semiconductors. A metal complex catalyst and a semiconductor appropriate for a CO2RR and visible-light absorption, respectively, are linked, and they function complementary way to catalyze CO2RR under visible-light irradiation as a particulate photocatalyst dispersion in solution. It has also been proven that Ru complexes with bipyridine ligands can catalyze a CO2RR as photocathodes when they are linked with various semiconductor surfaces, such as those of doped tantalum oxides, doped iron oxides, indium phosphides, copper-based sulfides, selenides, silicon, and others. These photocathodes can produce formate and carbon monoxide using electrons and protons extracted from water through potential-matched connections with photoanodes such as TiO2 or SrTiO3 for oxygen evolution reactions (OERs). Benefiting from the very low overpotential of an aqueous CO2RR at metal complexes approaching the theoretical lower limit, the semiconductor/molecule hybrid system demonstrates a single tablet-formed monolithic electrode called "artificial leaf." This single electrode device can generate formate (HCOO-) from H2O and CO2 in a water-filled single-compartment reactor without requiring a separation membrane under unassisted or bias-free conditions, either electrically or chemically. The reaction proceeds with a stoichiometric electron/hole ratio and stores solar energy with a solar-to-chemical energy conversion efficiency of 4.6%, which exceeds that of plants. In this Account, the key results that marked our milestones in technological progress of the semiconductor/molecule hybrid photosystem are concisely explained. These results include design, proof of the principle, and understanding of the phenomena by time-resolved spectroscopies, synchrotron radiation analyses, and DFT calculations. These results enable us to address challenges toward further scientific progress and the social implementation, including the use of earthabundant elements and the scale-up of the solar-driven CO2RR system.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			0001-4842	1520-4898		WOS:000783714900002	34851099

Biokhimiia (Moscow, Russia)				45	8			1352	60						1980-Aug	1980	Upon illumination of the system containing chlorophyll a+b adsorbed on a SiO2 sorbent, ADP and Pi in an aqueous solution, pH 7.6, the formation of ATP has been demonstrated, using 32P-phosphate. This process is inhibited in the absence of oxygen or in the presence of ascorbate. Under similar conditions without ADP pyrophosphate is formed; substitution of ADP for arginine results in a formation of arginine phosphate. Phosphorylation with a reduced yield has also been found upon illumination of chlorophyll adsorbate without other additives and an addition of ADP+Pi solution in the dark to the preilluminated adsorbate fast enough to prevent the decay of the light-induced product. A model according to which the chlorophyll-sensitized oxidation of orthophosphate ion the primary event in the reaction sequence, and the decomposition of orthophosphate radical anion into methaphosphate and hydroxyl species is the secondary step, has been proposed. A possible significance of the results obtained is discussed in terms of the concepts on the prebiotic evolution of energy metabolism.									9	0	0	0	2	0	9			0320-9725			MEDLINE:7236786	7236786

It is well known that standalone NiFe-LDH executes poor electrical conductivity, sluggish mass transfer, and low activity, which put a question mark on their catalytic efficiency and other applications that require superior electrical conductivity and exciton pair separation efficiency. Most importantly, this constraint creates a hindrance to their superior performance in the area of electrocatalytic and photochemical water splitting. To avoid these shortcomings, the coupled structure of NiFe-LDH/graphene has the potential to reflect properties of both NiFe-LDHs and conductive graphene, which completely overcome the shortcomings of counterparts, ensuring better performance and stability. This review aims to summarize the structural impact of NiFe-LDHs, with the interfacial role of graphene/graphene oxide (GO) by establishing a relationship between their structure and activity. Moreover, the emphasis has been laid on the latest development in NiFe-LDH/GO-based materials, along with attention to synthetic methods targeting the creation of a hierarchal porous nature in the materials with different growth approaches to NiFe-LDH on graphene for applications in electrocatalytic, photoelectrocatalytic, and photocatalytic water splitting activities. The latest research and development in this field using NiFe-LDH/graphene with a sensible intermixing of active sites and conductive framework is explored.									34	0	0	0	1	0	34			2052-1553			WOS:000579499200002

The Pd icosahedra were obtained with purity >94% and uniform sizes controlled in the range of 5-17 nm by using ethylene glycol as both the reductant and solvent. The studies indicate that the formation of Pd nanocrystals with an icosahedral shape was very sensitive to the reaction kinetics. The success of this synthesis relies on the use of HCl to manipulate the reaction kinetics and thus control the twin structure and shape of the resultant nanocrystals. The size of the Pd icosahedra could be further increased up to 35 nm by seed-mediated growth, with 17 nm Pd icosahedra serving as seeds. The multiply twinned Pd icosahedra could grow into larger sizes, and their shape and multiply twinned structure were preserved. Thanks to the presence of twin defects, the Pd icosahedra showed a catalytic current density towards formic-acid oxidation that was 1.9 and 11.6 times higher than that of single-crystal Pd octahedra, which were also fully covered by {111} facets, and commercial Pd/C, respectively.									58	2	0	0	5	0	60			1864-5631	1864-564X		WOS:000330881800010	24106017

Herein, hierarchically porous cobalt-iron oxide nanosheets were successfully prepared using NaBH4 as a reductant and high concentration cetyl trimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) as a surfactant. Characterization results showed that the CTAB would induce the form of a bilayer structure while NaBH4 would promote the generation of enriched oxygen vacancies. As a result, the as-prepared Co1Fe1-300 exhibited high activity for activating peroxymonosulfate and achieved 100% phenol degradation within 30 min. This excellent catalytic activity can be attributed to its hierarchically porous structure, more active sites and oxygen vacancies. Co leaching test indicated that the Co1Fe1-300 exhibited excellent catalytic stability. Mechanistic studies suggested that two main degradation pathways were involved during phenol oxidation process, in which SO4 center dot- played a significant role. This work may offer a novel strategy for the synthesis of high activity catalysts and a promising system for the remediation of environmental pollutant. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

OH(v = 6) molecules, generated in a microwave discharge flow cell by the reaction of hydrogen atoms with ozone, are excited to v = 9 by the output of a pulsed infrared laser via direct vibrational overtone excitation. The temporal evolution of the v = 9 population is probed as a function of the collider gas partial pressure by a time-delayed pulsed ultraviolet laser. The probe laser light is resonant with the B2SIGMA+-X2PI (0,9) transition and the resulting visible B2SIGMA+-A2SIGMA+ fluorescence is detected with a filtered photomultiplier tube. We measure rate constants for N2O: (6.4 +/- 1.0) x 10(-11) ; CO2: (5.7 +/- 0.6) x 10(-11); O2: (1.7 +/- 1.1) x 10(-11); H-2: < 3 x 10(-12): He: < 2 x 10(-12); N2: < 5 x 10(-13); Ar: < 2 x 10(-13) (all in units of cm3 s-1).

The results obtained show that voltammograms for the amorphous alloy change with time becoming stable after 20-25 cycles between -1900 and +100 mV vs saturated sulphate electrode. Comparisons among voltammograms for polycrystalline iron, cobalt and the amorphous alloy, suggest that the first step of the anodic dissolution of the amorphous alloy is cobalt dissolution. The stable voltammogram of the amorphous alloy is quite similar to that of pure iron in the same environment, suggesting that after 20-25 cycles only iron dissolves. The electrocatalytic properties of the amorphous alloy vs the hydrogen evolution reaction in 1 M KOH increases by increasing the number of cycles which have been attributed to a porous Fe3O4 layer covering the amorphous surface.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0010-938X			WOS:A1994NQ38700006

Herein, hierarchical CuCoNC nanowire arrays are constructed on copper foam, enriching multiple active species on the catalytic scaffolds that lead to remarkable trifunctional activities of OER with eta(10) = 245 mV, HER with eta(10) = 59 mV and ORR comparable to Pt/C. While for overall water splitting a cell voltage of only 1.78 V is required to achieve a high current density of 500 mA cm(-2), for Zn-air batteries (ZABs) a highly stabilized round-trip efficiency of > 58% is achieved for over 360 h under 10 mA cm(-2).

But the complex processes of post treatment generally led to the collapse of the original structures of MOFs, making the preservation of their pristine hierarchical porous structure a great challenge. Herein, we propose the strategy of alkali treatment of Ni-MOF to transform it into Ni(OH)(2) with similar morphology and enhanced electrocatalytic properties for methanol oxidation reaction (MOR). The structure and electrocatalytic properties of as-obtained Ni(OH)(2) nanostructured flowers were seriously depended on the alkali concentrations. As the result, Ni(OH)(2) obtained from Ni-MOF treated by 0.25 M NaOH (noted as Ni(OH)(2)-0.25) performs 1.5 and 2.5 times larger current density than those of Ni(OH)(2)-0.025 and Ni(OH)(2)-0.5 for MOR. Moreover, the electrocatalytic process and mechanism of MOR on the catalyst of Ni(OH)(2)-0.25 are also revealed. Hence, this ex situ conversion strategy of alkali treatment for Ni-MOF uncovered the transformation of MOFs in alkaline solution and develops robust electrocatalyst for practical application of methanol fuel cells.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			0947-6539	1521-3765		WOS:000656409000001	33982296

The sample is chemically homogeneous. Omphacite usually shows symplectitic intergrowths or a relictic character partially and totally included in amphibole. The transformation of omphacite to symplectites colonies characterizes the initiation of the eclogites retrograde metamorphism. The reaction history can be summarized as the decomposition of omphacite into symplectites as a product of decompression through the reaction: omphacite + quartz = plagioclase + clinopyroxene (low in Na), which can be considered as a discontinuous precipitation reaction. The structure of the studied omphacite single-crystal is successfully refined in the P2/c space group. This structure is interpreted as an intermediate towards omphacite with space group P2/n. The structure of omphacite shows silicate chains formed by two crystallographically different silicon tetrahedra (T1 and T2) with an O2-O3-O2 angle of 169.002 (2)degrees, indicating that the chain is slightly distorted. The Na and Ca cations occupy the octahedral and 8-coordination sites.

Measurements of [H] and [O] are conducted using mixtures of highly diluted CH2I2 (0.2 and 0.4 ppm) with excess O-2 (100 and 262 ppm) in Ar; comparative measurement of [H] in the 0.2 and 0.4 ppm CH2I2 + 300 ppm H-2 mixture has been conducted simultaneously to confirm the initial concentration of CH2. The apparent reaction rate of CH2 + O-2 (k(2)'), including the contributions of (CH2)-C-3 + O-2 -> products (2) and (CH2)-C-1 + O-2 -> products (3), has been measured from the evolutions of [H] and [O] and summarized as k(2)'/cm(3) molecule(-1) s(-1) = (1.90 +/- 0.31) x 10(-11). The contribution of (CH2)-C-1 + O-2 reaction on the measured k(2)' has been evaluated as 0.15 +/- 0.04, with an assumption that k(3) is independent of temperature and given by the result measured at room temperature [Langford, A. O.; Petek, H.; Moore, C. B. J. Chem. Phys. 1983, 78, 6650-6659]. The net rate for the (CH2)-C-3 + O-2 reaction is given as k(2)/cm(3) molecule(-1) s(-1) = (1.69 +/- 0.31) x 10(-11). The result on k(2) in this study is found to be consistent with the extrapolation of the previous work at lower temperature range of 295-600 K. [Vinckler, C.; Debruyn, W. J. Phys. Chem. 1979, 83, 2057-2062]; these results can be summarized as k(2)/cm(3) molecule(-1) s(-1) = 2.74 x 10(-11) exp(-874/T), (T = 295-2050 K). The apparent production yields of H and O atoms for the reaction channels (CH2)-C-1,3 + O-2 -> H + products (2a, 3a) and (1)'(CH2)-C-3 + O-2 -> O(P-3) + products (2h, 3b) have been evaluated as phi(2a)' = 0.59 +/- 0.06 and phi(2b)' = 0.23 +/- 0.06, respectively. The contributions of (CH2)-C-1 + O-2 reaction on measured phi(2a)' and phi(2b)' are indicated to be minor; the net branching fractions for the (CH2)-C-3+O-2 reaction are estimated as phi(2a) = 0.58 +/- 0.06 and phi(2b) = 0.25 +/- 0.06. No obvious temperature dependence is indicated in the measured rate constant nor in the branching fractions of H and 0 atoms. The mechanism of the reaction of CH2 with O-2 is discussed based on the result of the present study together with those of the previous theoretical/experimental studies.									19	0	0	0	0	0	19			1089-5639	1520-5215		WOS:000308855700004	22900832

Herein, we report the synthesis of ruthenium(iii) polyethyleneimine (Ru(iii)-PEI) catalysts supported on carboxyl-modified carbon nanotubes (Ru(iii)-PEI@MWCNTs) by a self-assembly process driven by electrostatic forces at room temperature. Our newly designed Ru(iii)-PEI@MWCNTs were employed as bifunctional catalysts for the NRR and 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) oxidation. At -0.10 V vs. the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE), our Ru(iii)-PEI@MWCNTs exhibited the high NH3 yield rate of 188.90 mu g(NH3) mg(cat.)(-1) h(-1) and the faradaic efficiency (FE) of 30.93% at room temperature. Furthermore, owing to its favorable thermodynamics for HMF oxidation, the Ru(iii)-PEI@MWCNT electrode demonstrated an impressive electrocatalytic HMF oxidation at 1.24 V, 220 mV lower than that for oxygen evolution. The two-electrode electrolyzer employing Ru(iii)-PEI@MWCNTs as a bifunctional catalyst for both the cathode and the anode showed the current density of 0.50 mA cm(-2) with the cell voltage of only 1.34 V over 27 hours of stable electrolysis with a 94% FE for 2,5-furandicarboxylic acid (FDCA) production; this suggested an outstanding performance of this electrolyzer for the coupling of NRR with HMF oxidation. This study represents the first attempt at the ground demonstration of combining NH3 production with biomass upgrading.									27	1	0	0	1	0	28			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000498556500021		
J	Cui XiaoLiang; Su ShangGuo; Meng WeiYi; Liu LuLu; Chen Chen								The mineralogical characteristics of amphiboles in monzonite porphyry from the Wuan area, Hebei Province and their indications for the genesis of the skarn iron deposit								ACTA PETROLOGICA SINICA				36	7			2215	2231		10.18654/1000-0569/2020.07.19				2020	2020	The ore-forming process requires a huge amount of ore-bearing fluids, and it is still controversial whether the ore-bearing fluids of the skarn iron deposit are precipitated from the ore-induced intrusions or the deep magma. In order to study the properties of ore-bearing fluids during the evolution of ore-forming intrusive rocks in the skarn deposits in the Han-Xing area and their contribution to mineralization, we performed a detailed in situ analysis of major and trace elements in amphiboles from amphibole monzonite porphyry in Wuan area using electron microprobe (EMPA) analysis and laser ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS). Petrographic features show that amphiboles can be divided into two types: brown amphiboles and green amphiboles. The amphibole phenocrysts are mainly brown amphiboles and have reaction rim texture: from the inside to the outside, there are biotite zone, diopside and plagioclase zone, green amphibole and magnetite zone. The matrix amphiboles are mainly green but some are brown in the core. The brown amphiboles are magnesiohastingsite and pargasite, the green amphiboles are magnesiohornblende, endenite and actinolite. The chemical composition of brown amphiboles has low Si, high Ti and Al; and the green amphiboles have high Si, low Al and Ti. According to the hornblende thermobarometer, brown amphibole phenocrysts formed in relatively high pressure (400 similar to 560MPa) and high temperature (950 similar to 980 degrees C) of the deep magma chamber; brown matrix amphiboles formed at a lower pressure (200 similar to 300MPa), and little temperature changes (870 similar to 940 degrees C) of the shallow magma chamber; green amphiboles formed in the low pressure (<100MPa) and temperature (700 similar to 880 degrees C) of the final emplacement depth. The magma has a high degree of oxygen fugacity, and from the brown amphibole to the green amphibole, the magmas oxygen fugacity increases. A high degree of oxygen fugacity can prevent the iron from entering the sulfide but go into the ore-bearing fluids more. Meanwhile, the high water content in magma can promote aqueous fluids and volatile to exsolution in a low pressure, making the metallogenic element easier to enrich and migrate. Compared with the brown amphiboles, the green amphiboles have a stronger negative anomaly of Nb, Sr, Pb and Ti but extremely high Nb/Ta values, which indicate that the green amphiboles were formed by the fluids metasomatism. Combined with brown amphibole phenocrysts reaction rim products and the analysis and calculation of iron content, we conclude that the addition of an exotic alkaline iron-rich fluid is necessary. The genetic model of the Han-Xing type iron deposit may not be the traditional contact hydrothermal metasomatism model; the iron source of the skarn iron deposit should be a deep ore-bearing fluid. The brown amphibole phenocrysts are crystallized in the deep magma chamber of 15 similar to 20km, then the magma emplaces into the shallow magma chamber of 7 similar to 10km and the brown matrix amphiboles crystallizes. And now the magma chamber is close to consolidated and semi-consolidated. Subsequently, the external alkaline iron-rich fluids injecting into the freezing magma and making it activated. The magma ascends quickly and emplaces at 1 similar to 3km; the pressure rapidly reduced prompting the ore-forming fluids exsolved from the magma, then the green amphiboles crystallize.The injection of foreign alkaline iron-rich fluids make the magma emplace rapidly and a large amount of ore-forming fluids dissolve under the conditions of high water content and high oxygen fugacity. These factors all promote the formation of skarn iron ore in the Han-Xing district.									1	2	0	0	0	0	3			1000-0569	2095-8927		WOS:000596477200019

However, in addition to C-N-x sites, the high structural heterogeneity of N-doped carbon materials often contains metal-N-x sites and graphene encapsulated metal nanoparticle simultaneously, as a result of their metal-assistant synthesis method. Thus it is challenging to identify the predominant active structure within N-doped carbon catalysts for RFBs, which normally receives far less attention in the field of RFB research. Herein, we report a general metal-organic frameworks assisted approach to high-yield growth of nitrogen-doped carbon nanotubes (NCNTs) onto 3D graphite felt (GF) substrates without the requirement of any additional C and N sources or costly and complex CVD systems. The obtained NCNTs-modified GF (NCNT-GF) exhibits high electrocatalytic activity and stability toward cerium redox reactions. Based on the moderate and selective NH4Cl-purification process and the electrochemical poison experiments, we definitely elucidate the spectator role of atomically dispersed metal-N-x sites and graphene encapsulated metal nanoparticles, and the pivotal role of C-N-x sites in the NCNT-GF materials for cerium redox reactions.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			2405-8297			WOS:000577179100002

However, limitations in the efficiency of the implemented biophotovoltaic systems prevent their use in practical applications. In particular, the effective minimization of recombination processes in photosystem I (PSI) modified bioelectrodes is crucial for enabling a unidirectional electron flow allowing the true potential of the large charge separation at PSI being exploited. Here, we present controlled immobilization of PSI monolayers with a predefined preferential orientation that translates into anisotropic electron flow upon irradiation. Further interface of the oriented PSI monolayer with redox polymers allows an efficient electron transfer and minimization of possible short-circuiting pathways. To complete the functional biophotocathode, the PSI monolayer is coupled to a hydrogenase (H(2)ase) to realize light-induced H-2 evolution. The PSI/H(2)ase biocathode is then combined with a redox polymer/photosystem II-based bioanode demonstrating a fully light-driven Z-scheme mimic biophotovoltaic cell for bias-free water splitting.									22	1	0	0	2	0	22			1754-5692	1754-5706		WOS:000489897600014

The biogenic S of red algae mainly exists in carrageenan molecules. In this work, 89% of C and 96% of biogenic S in carrageenan was synchronically fixed into biochar to form thiophene S decorated biochar aerogel (SCA), efficiently preventing the loss of C and S elements. More importantly, the presence of thiophene S structure in SCA can "push" electrons into the antibonding orbitals of N-2, and simultaneously "pull" the lone-pair electrons from N-2, thus endowing the SCA super activity for nitrogen reduction reaction. Experimentally, its NH3 yield rate reaches high as 36.69 mu g h(-1) mg(cat)(-1), surpassing most metal- free electrocatalysts. Theoretical calculations demonstrate that the thiophene S can promote the absorption and activation of N-2, and efficiently lower the energy barrier of N-2 protonation.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000860691000004

Thermodynamic study of evolution of sinter phases at different alumina level								IRONMAKING & STEELMAKING				44	2			92	99		10.1080/03019233.2016.1156870				2017	2017	Though sintering is controlled by kinetics of various reactions and is far from equilibrium, a thermodynamic analysis can provide useful inputs on melt formation and helps understand deviation from actual process conditions. The thermodynamic software 'FACTSAGE (TM)' was used for this study. The general sequence of reactions during the heating cycle is as follows: decomposition of calcium carbonate to calcined lime; formation of calcium ferrites/silicates; decomposition of calcium ferrites, reduction of haematite to magnetite and formation of spinel and silicates; assimilation of ferrites, silicates, spinel and magnetite into the melt. During the cooling stage, the amount of melt decreased with subsequent precipitation of phases such as magnetite, ferrites, silicates, spinel and formation of haematite. It is very much clear that the sinter made by using higher alumina levels generate fewer amounts of oxides and more slag phase compared to its low alumina counterpart.									7	2	0	0	0	0	9			0301-9233	1743-2812		WOS:000396713200002

However, the overall water splitting reaction is limited by the sluggish oxidation step. Bismuth vanadate (BiVO4) has been identified as one of the most promising n-type semiconductors for photocatalytic water oxidation due to its small energy gap and favorable band alignment. Thus, it is necessary to summarize the recent progress done on BiVO4 for the guidance of future research. In this review, we have discussed recent strategies that have been adopted to boost its photoconversion efficiency at three different levels: (1) facet control, (2) morphological control and, (3) interfacial control. The roles of high indexed facets, anisotropic morphologies, and mediator-based Z schemes are comprehensively discussed and the emphasis is given to find the suitable structural, morphological, and interfacial combination of BiVO4 for efficient water oxidation.

Until now some methods have been developed to inhibit leaching or sintering individually. However, a route able to avoid leaching and sintering simultaneously is still lacking. Herein, we develop a thermally driven interfacial diffusion alloying route that allows for the direct evolution of solid Pt nanoparticles (NPs) supported on carbon (Pt/C) into a Pt-skin-like hollow PtFe alloy or a structurally ordered intermetallic PtFe alloy, together with in situ encapsulation of PtFe alloy NPs with a thin layer porous nitrogen-doped carbon (NC) shell. The robust NC shells not only effectively prevent Pt-based NPs from detachment, migration, and aggregation during accelerated durability tests but also allow smoother access of electrolyte to the Pt surface, thus allowing the catalysts to well preserve their high catalytic activity. The well-defined shape and atomic arrangement of PtFe alloy NPs exhibit over 600% increase in mass activity and specific activity when compared with that of the pristine Pt/C catalyst. Stability tests confirm that the ordered PtFe alloy is more electrochemically stable than the disordered hollow PtFe alloy and Pt/C catalysts due to its ordered atomic arrangement and the robust NC shell.									28	5	0	0	1	0	30			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000498838100045	31612897

We systematically analyzed the composition and morphology of FexCo1-xSe2/g-C3N4 and attributed the remarkable electrochemical performance of the catalyst to its unique structure. Fe0.2Co0.8Se2/g-C3N4 showed a superior HER activity, with quite low overpotential value (83mV at -20 mA cm(-2) in 0.5M H2SO4) and a current density of -3.24, -7.84, -14.80, -30.12mAcm(-2) at 0V (vs RHE) in Dulbecco's Phosphate-Buffered Saline (DPBS), artificial sea water (ASW), 0.5M H2SO4 and 1M KOH, respectively. To the best of our knowledge, these are the highest reported current densities at this low potential value, showing intrinsic catalytic activity of the synthesized material. Also, the catalyst was found to deliver a high and stable current density of -1000 mA cm(-2) at an overpotential of just 317mV. Moreover, the synthesized catalyst delivered a constant current density of -30 mA cm(-2) for 24h without any noticeable change in potential at -0.2V. These attributes confer our synthesized catalyst to be used for renewable fuel production and applications.									11	0	0	0	1	0	11			2045-2322			WOS:000562162800006	32286435

To date, less progress has been made in tuning the interface structures of pyrite for promoting the catalytic activity towards overall water splitting. Herein, we developed a facile one-spot strategy to make carbon-layer-coated CoS2-FeS2 heterojunction nanosheets. The carbon layer and interface structures between Co-S and Fe-S were characterized via high resolution transmission electron microscopy. It exhibited a high OER activity with 1.47 V at 10 mA cm(-2), which was superior to that of the commercial RuO2. Meanwhile, the carbon-layer-coated CoS2-FeS2 heterojunction nanosheets with the overpotential of 210 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) was more active than FeS2 nanosheets with 240 mV in the hydrogen evolution reaction. Notably, it enhanced the catalytic activity towards the overall water splitting with the voltage of 1.66 V at 10 mA cm(-2) using a two-electrode system. The remarkable long-term stability was verified by a slight change in the current density of 6 mA cm(-2) for 26 h. The prominent catalytic activity could be related to the exposure of the carbon layer and interface structures. This work demonstrates that engineering the interface structure is essential for boosting the overall water splitting activity.									16	0	0	0	0	0	16			1477-9226	1477-9234		WOS:000575307000016	32945828

Herein, the performance and stability during sulfite electrolysis under alkaline conditions are evaluated. Nickel foam (NF) substrates were functionalized as the anode and cathode through electrochemical deposition of palladium and chemical oxidation to carry out the sulfite electro-oxidation and hydrogen evolution reactions, respectively. A combined analytical approach in which a robust electrochemical flow cell was coupled to different in situ and ex situ measurements was successfully implemented to monitor the activity and stability during electrolysis. Overall, satisfactory sulfite conversion and hydrogen production efficiencies (>90%) at 10 mA.cm(-2) were mainly attributed to the use of NF in three-dimensional electrodes with a large surface area and enhanced mass transfer. Furthermore, stabilization processes associated with electrochemical dissolution and sulfur crossover through the membrane induced specific changes in the chemical and physical properties of the electrodes after electrolysis. This study demonstrates that NF-based electrocatalysts can be incorporated in an efficient electrochemical flow cell system for sulfite electrolysis and hydrogen production, with potential applications at a large scale.									10	0	0	0	2	0	10			0013-936X	1520-5851		WOS:000580444600089	32902265

Oxyhalogen-sulfur electrochemistry offers a new hybrid Li-ion/Li-O-2 battery, where both Li ions and O anions are reversibly stored in the MoS(2 )structure. A Li2MoO2S2 compound is formed as the main discharge product that has never been previously observed in the literature. The reaction mechanism and the structure of the Li(2)MoO(2)S(2 )are probed by Raman spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, X-ray absorption spectroscopy, differential electrochemical mass spectrometry, and UV-visible spectroscopy. The results show that the MoS(2 )is oxidized during discharge and is recovered during charge. The iodine intermediates play an important role in triggering the sequence of electrochemical and chemical reactions in the cell. The Li2MoO2S2 is isostructural to the Li2MoO4 rather than adopting structures of other known molybdenum oxysulfides.									12	1	0	0	0	0	12			2542-4351			WOS:000450940600018

Hydrogen Evolving Activity of Dithiolene-Based Metal-Organic Frameworks with Mixed Cobalt and Iron Centers								INORGANIC CHEMISTRY				60	16			11923	11931		10.1021/acs.inorgchem.1c00900		AUG 2021		AUG 16 2021	2021	Electrocatalytic systems based on metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) have attracted great attention due to their potential application in commercially viable renewable energy-converting devices. We have recently shown that the cobalt 2,3,6,7,10,11-triphenylenehexathiolate (CoTHT) framework can catalyze the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in fully aqueous media with Tafel slopes as low as 71 mV/dec and near-uni Faradaic efficiency (FE). Taking advantage of the high synthetic tunability of MOFs, here, we synthesize a series of iron and mixed iron/cobalt THT-based MOFs. The incorporation of the iron and cobalt dithiolene moieties is verified by various spectroscopic techniques, and the integrity of the crystalline structure is maintained regardless of the stoichiometries of the two metals. The hydrogen evolving activity of the materials was explored in pH 1.3 aqueous electrolyte solutions. Unlike CoTHT, the FeTHT framework exhibits minimal activity due to a late catalytic onset [-0.440 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE)] and a large Tafel slope (210 mV/dec). The performance of the mixed-metal MOFs is adversely affected by the incorporation of Fe, where increasing Fe content results in MOFs with lower HER activity and diminished long-term stability and FE for H-2 production. It is proposed that the FeTHT domains undergo alternative Faradaic processes under catalytic conditions, which alter its local structure and electrochemical behavior, eventually resulting in a material with diminished HER performance.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			0020-1669	1520-510X		WOS:000687044700028	34352176

The influence of the type and additive concentration on the nanostructure, topography and composition of the WO3 layers are mainly related to the surface tension energy changes, and further correlated with the (photo) electrical and optical properties.The FTO/WO3 junction through its characteristic, namely barrier height, ideality factor, flat band potential, and series resistance, served as a tool for associating the before mentioned characteristics. The morphology of the WO3 thin films densifies and the roughness is reduced with increasing Ti and Mo concentration, in good agreement with solution surface tension reduction. WO3 based films exhibit a p-type semiconducting behavior, as confirmed also by the Mott-Schottky analysis, with a lower p-type conductivity for the Ti-WO3 films, as higher number of oxygen vacancies are generated by Ti addition. Changes in conductivity are mainly attributed to the oxygen vacancies concentration evolution at the film surface due to oxygen/water adsorption. For heavily doped WO3 thin films the contribution of these surface processes to the overall conductivity is reduced since surface reactivity is lost by densification.As opposed to Ti-doping which has a detrimental effect on layers structure, Mo addition, even in high concentrations, has a positive effect on layers crystallinity; hence higher conductivity and ideality factors close to 1 are obtained for these films. Surprisingly, Ti and Mo-WO3 films contain cation additives also in lower oxidation states, 3+ and 5+, respectively, compared to the ones in the precursor salt. A 2 at.% Ti concentration is enough to significantly improve the photoconductivity of the WO3 films, whereas for Mo addition higher levels are needed (10 at.%). The Ti and Mo-WO3 films have high transparency with average transmission values of 85% and 75%, respectively. The thin films reflectance decreases with increasing doping concentration along with roughness diminution. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Although non-noble metal electrodes can fulfill some requirements in terms of performance and price, their stability in alkaline media is generally weak. Additionally, from the environmental view point, the use of metals can cause water contamination. Therefore, the preparation of metal-free electrocatalysts represents an appealing approach to overcome the above-mentioned shortcuts. In this work, we used a simple electrochemical activation process, chronoamperometry measurements conducted in 1 M KOH at various overpotentials (-2, -2.5, -3, and -4 V vs. RHE) and pre-polarization periods (0.5, 2, 4, and 12 h), of commercially available and cheap carbon felt (CF) electrode to achieve good performance for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in alkaline media. Under optimized operating conditions (12 h of chronoamperometry measurement acquired at an overpotential of -4 V vs. RHE), the CF electrode exhibited an overpotential of 182 mV at 10 mA/cm(2), a value surpassing that recorded for the most efficacious metal-free HER electrocatalysts published in the literature. The two CF samples exposed to 12 h of cathodic activation at -2.5 and -3.0 V vs. RHE recorded respectively Tafel slope (b(c)) values of 110 and 126 mV dec(-1). These b(c) values are close to the standard b(c) value of 120 mV dec(-1), suggesting the Volmer step as the main step controlling the HER. Increasing the applied cathodic potential to -4.0 V vs. RHE further decreased the b(c) value to 90 mV dec(-1), referring to increased accessible active catalytic sites for the HER. The cathodically activated CF surface's morphology and composition were assessed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) examinations. Raman spectroscopy was also conducted to assess the influence of the cathodic activation process on the structural defects/disorder of the CF surface. The formation of oxygen-containing groups on the CF surface after cathodic activation, as evidenced from XPS analysis, is believed to enhance water adsorption and act as active sites for hydrogen generation. The technique developed herein is simple and straightforward and can be easily implemented for almost any type of electrode. (C) 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Cui, Bingbing; Fu, Guodong								Process of metal-organic framework (MOF)/covalent-organic framework (COF) hybrids-based derivatives and their applications on energy transfer and storage								NANOSCALE				14	5			1679	1699		10.1039/d1nr07614k		JAN 2022		FEB 3 2022	2022	The fossil-fuel shortage and severe environmental issues have posed ever-increasing demands on clean and renewable energy sources, for which the exploration of electrocatalysts has been a big challenge toward energy transfer and storage. Some indispensable features of electrocatalysts, such as large surface area, controlled structure, high porosity, and effective functionalization, have been proved to be critical for the improvement of electrocatalytic activities. Recently, the rapid expansion of metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), covalent-organic frameworks (COFs), and porous-organic polymers has provided extensive opportunities for the development of various electrocatalysts. Moreover, combining diverse descriptions of porous-organic frameworks (such as MOFs and COFs) can generate amazing and fantastic properties, affording the formed MOF/COF (including core-shell MOF@MOF and MOF@COF and layer-on-layer MOF-on-MOF or COF-on-MOF) heterostructures wide applications in diverse fields, especially in clean energy and energy transfer. To further boosts electronic conductivity, catalytic performances, and energy storage abilities, these MOF/COF hybrid materials have been widely utilized as versatile precursors for the manufacture of transition metal catalysts embedded within mesoporous carbon nitrides (M@CNx) and porous carbon nitride frameworks (CNx) via a facile pyrolysis process. Given that these M@CNx and CNx hybrids are composed of abundant catalytic centers, rich functionalities, and large specific surface areas, vast applications in energy transfer and energy storage fields can be realized. In this mini-review, we summarize the preparation strategies of MOF/COF-based hybrids, as well as their derivatives, nanostructure formation mechanism of M@CNx and CNx hybrids from MOF/COF-based hybrid materials, and their applications as catalysts for driving diverse reactions and electrode materials for energy storage. Further, current challenges and future prospects of applying these derivatives into energy conversion and storage devices are also discussed.									9	0	0	0	1	0	9			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000744561100001	35048101

The catalyst exhibits the highest HOR activity among all non-precious metal catalysts (e.g., 20 fold higher than Ni). At a sufficient loading, the CoNiMo catalyst is expected to outperform Pt and thus provides a promising low cost pathway for alkaline or alkaline membrane fuel cells. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations and parallel H-2-temperature programmed desorption (TPD) experiments on structurally much simpler model alloy systems show a trend that CoNiMo has a hydrogen binding energy (HBE) similar to Pt and much lower than Ni, suggesting that the formation of multi-metallic bonds modifies the HBE of Ni and is likely a significant contributing factor for the enhanced HOR activity.									204	16	0	0	18	0	207			1754-5692	1754-5706		WOS:000335013700021

Under high-NOx conditions ring-opening products are the primary gas-phase products, suggesting that the mechanism involves dissociation of alkoxy radicals (RO) formed through an RO2 + NO pathway, or a bicyclic peroxy mechanism. In contrast to the high-NOx, chemistry, ring-retaining compounds appear to dominate the low-NOx gas-phase products owing to the RO2 + HO2 pathway. We are able to chemically characterize 53-68% of the secondary organic aerosol (SOA) mass. Atomic oxygen-to-carbon (O/C), hydrogen-to-carbon (H/C), and nitrogen-to-carbon (N/C) ratios measured in bulk samples by high-resolution electrospray ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (HR-ESI-TOFMS) are the same as the ratios observed with online high-resolution time-of-flight aerosol mass spectrometry (HR-ToF-AMS), Suggesting that the chemical composition!; and oxidation levels found in the chemically-characterized fraction of the particle phase are representative of the bulk aerosol. Oligomers, organosulfates (R-OSO3), and other high-molecular-weight (MW) products are not observed in either the low- or high-NOx SOA; however, in the presence of neutral ammonium sulfate seed aerosol, an organic sulfonic acid (R-SO3), characterized as hydroxybenzene sulfonic acid, is observed in naphthalene SOA produced under both high- and low-NOx conditions. Acidic compounds and organic peroxides are found to account for a large fraction of the chemically characterized high- and low-NOx SOA. We propose that the major gas- and aerosol-phase products observed are generated through the formation and further reaction of 2-formylcinnamaldehyde or a bicyclic peroxy intermediate. The chemical similarity between the laboratory SOA and ambient aerosol collected from Birmingham, Alabama (AL) and Pasadena, California (CA) confirm the importance of PAH oxidation in the formation of aerosol within the urban atmosphere.									184	6	0	0	98	0	188			1089-5639	1520-5215		WOS:000273400600029	19904975

Cu NP catalysts in the 2-15 nm mean size range were prepared, and their catalytic activity and selectivity during CO2 electroreduction were analyzed and compared to a bulk Cu electrode. A dramatic increase in the catalytic activity and selectivity for H-2 and CO was observed with decreasing Cu particle size, in particular, for NPs below 5 nm. Hydrocarbon (methane and ethylene) selectivity was increasingly suppressed for nanoscale Cu surfaces. The size dependence of the surface atomic coordination of model spherical Cu particles was used to rationalize the experimental results. Changes in the population of low-coordinated surface sites and their stronger chemisorption were linked to surging H-2 and CO selectivities, higher catalytic activity, and smaller hydrocarbon selectivity. The presented activity-selectivity-size relations provide novel insights in the CO2 electroreduction reaction on nanoscale surfaces. Our smallest nanoparticles (similar to 2 nm) enter the ab initio computationally accessible size regime, and therefore, the results obtained lend themselves well to density functional theory (DFT) evaluation and reaction mechanism verification.									863	46	0	0	70	1	876			0002-7863	1520-5126		WOS:000336078400042	24746172

YIELDS OF WEAK SUPERNOVAE AND ABUNDANCES OF CARBON-ENHANCED HYPER-METAL-POOR STARS								ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL				794	1					40	10.1088/0004-637X/794/1/40				OCT 10 2014	2014	We perform a stellar evolution simulation of first stars and calculate stellar yields from the first supernovae. The initial masses are taken from 12 to 140 M-circle dot to cover the whole range of core collapse supernova progenitors, and stellar rotation is included, which results in efficient internal mixing. A weak explosion is assumed in supernova yield calculations, thus only outer distributed matter, which is not affected by the explosive nucleosynthesis, is ejected in the models. We show that the initial mass and the rotation affect the explosion yield. All the weak explosion models have abundances of [C/O] larger than unity. Stellar yields from massive progenitors of >40-60 M-circle dot show enhancement of Mg and Si. Rotating models yield abundant Na and Al, and Ca is synthesized in nonrotating heavy massive models of >80 M-circle dot. We fit the stellar yields to the three most iron-deficient stars and constrain the initial parameters of the mother progenitor stars. The abundance pattern in SMSS 0313-6708 is well explained by 50-80 M-circle dot nonrotating models, rotating 30-40 M-circle dot models well fit the abundance of HE 0107-5240, and both nonrotating and rotating 15-40 M-circle dot models explain HE 1327-2326. The presented analysis will be applicable to other carbon-enhanced hyper-metal-poor stars observed in the future. The abundance analyses will give valuable information about the characteristics of the first stars.									55	0	0	0	0	0	55			0004-637X	1538-4357		WOS:000342581200040		
J	Kozma, C; Fransson, C								Late spectral evolution of SN 1987A. I. Temperature and ionization								ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL				496	2			946	966		10.1086/305409				APR 1 1998	1998	The temperature and ionization of SN 1987A are modeled time-dependently in its nebular phase between 200 and 2000 days. We include all important elements, as well as the primary composition zones in the supernova. The energy input is provided by radioactive decay of Co-56, Co-57, and Ti-44. The thermalization of the resulting gamma-rays and positrons is calculated by solving the Spencer-Fano equation. Both the ionization and the individual level populations are calculated time-dependently, Adiabatic cooling is included in the energy equation. Charge transfer is important for determining the ionization, and is included with available and estimated rates. Full, multilevel atoms are used for the observationally important ions. As input models for the calculations we use explosion models for SN 1987A calculated by Woosley et al. and Nomoto et al.The most important result in this paper concerns the evolution of the temperature and ionization of the various abundance zones. The metal-rich core undergoes a thermal instability, often referred to as the IR catastrophe, at 600-1000 days. The hydrogen-rich zones evolve adiabatically after 500-800 days, while in the helium region both adiabatic cooling and line cooling are of equal importance after similar to 1000 days. Freezeout of the recombination is important in the hydrogen and helium zones. Concomitant with the IR catastrophe, the bulb; of the emission shifts from optical and near-IR lines to the mid-and far-IR. After the IR catastrophe, the cooling is mainly due to far-IR lines and adiabatic expansion.Dust cooling is likely to be important in the zones where dust forms. We find that the dust condensation temperatures occur later than similar to 500 days in the oxygen-rich zones, and that the most favorable zone for dust condensation is the iron core. The uncertainties introduced by the (in some cases) unknown charge transfer rates are discussed. Especially for ions with low abundances, differences can be substantial.									76	0	1	0	0	0	77			0004-637X	1538-4357		WOS:000073048100033

Cobalt vanadate with 4:1, 1:4, and 1:1 ratios of Co:V was synthesized by co-precipitation method and labeled as CV1[4:1], CV2[1:4], and CV3[1:1], respectively. XRD patterns of the samples matched well with standard files. UV spectra revealed absorption spectra in the visible region. Bandgap value also decreased when the activity of both Co and V was in equal ratio. PL spectra showed better semiconducting properties and transition of V-3d energy states. Vibration spectra explored a detailed study of symmetric, asymmetric, bending vibrations of Co, V, and O atoms present in the sample. The morphology of CV1 sample showed a cluster of nanoparticles and formed a giant nanocluster. The CV2 and CV3 samples showed rice husk morphology and nanocrystals with no surface agglomeration. The current density yielded by CV[4:1], CV[1:4], and CV[1:1] samples were 200, 262, and 310 mA g(-1), respectively, with overpotential of 324, 224, and 194 mV. Small overpotential with large current density was obtained by the CV[1:1] sample. The CV[1:1] electrode showed 99% retention after 16 h of CA. The appropriate ratio, better morphology, and low overpotential make the CV[1:1] sample an encouraging catalyst for energy splitting applications.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			2162-8769	2162-8777		WOS:000672307600001

Electrochemical oxidation is a promising process for decentralized treatment of pharmaceutical wastewater. In this study, electrochemical oxidation of a typical antibiotic, i. e. sulfadiazine (SDZ), was investigated by using titanium suboxide mesh (TiSOM) anode. The results showed that the 60 min electrolysis could achieve almost 100% removal of SDZ based on 0.05 mol L-1 Na2SO4, pH = 6.33, and current density of 10 mA cm(-2). Under these conditions, the abatement of SDZ proceeded through indirect center dot OH-mediated oxidation rather than direct electron transfer reaction, indicated by cyclic voltammetry (CV) and electron spin resonance (ESR) measurement. The TiSOM anode exhibited a high oxygen evolution potential (2.2 V vs standard hydrogen electrode, SHE) for center dot OH formation and long-term stability in treatment of real pharmaceutical wastewater. The mesh structure of TiSOM anode enabled a large electrochemically active surface area (ECSA, 2517.3 cm(2)) derived from electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurement, and an improved mass transfer from bulk electrolyte to the anode under flow-through operation. This makes the TiSOM anode more advantageous than flat-plate anode. The degradation pathway of SDZ was underlined on a qualitative basis by using ion chromatography, ultra performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry/ mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS) and density functional theory (DFT) calculation. This study provides an effective manner for electrochemical treatment of pharmaceutical wastewater by using a mesh-structured TiSO anode material. (c) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Before the final reaction with water proceeds to yield O-2 (transition S-4 --> S-0), two oxidizing equivalents are stored on Mn-4 (S-0 double right arrow S-1 double right arrow S-2), a third on X (S-2 double right arrow S-3), and a forth on Y-Z (S-3 double right arrow S-4). It has been proposed that Y-Z functions as a pure electron transmitter between Mn4X and P-680, or, more recently, that it acts as an abstractor of hydrogen from bound water. We scrutinized the coupling of electron and proton transfer during the oxidation of Y-Z in PSII core particles with intact or impaired oxygen-evolving capacity, The rates of electron transfer to P-680(+), of electrochromism, and of pH transients were determined as a function of the pH, the temperature, and the H/D ratio, In oxygen-evolving material, we found only evidence for electrostatically induced proton release from peripheral amino acid residues but not from Y-Z(ox) itself. The positive charge stayed near Y-Z(ox), and the rate of electron transfer was nearly independent of the pH. In core particles with an impaired Mn-4 cluster, on the other hand, the rate of the electron transfer became strictly dependent on the protonation state of a single base (pK approximate to 7). At pH <7, the rate of electron transfer revealed the same slow rate (t(1/2) approximate to 35 mu s) as that of proton release into the bulk. The deposition of a positive charge around Y-Z(ox) was no longer detected. A large H/D isotope effect (approximate to 2.5) on these rates was also indicative of a steering of electron abstraction by proton transfer. That Y-Z(ox) was deprotonated into the bulk in inactive but not in oxygen-evolving material argues against the proposed role of Y-Z(ox) as an acceptor of hydrogen from water. Instead, the positive charge in its vicinity may shift the equilibrium from bound water to bound peroxide upon S-3 double right arrow S-4 as a prerequisite for the formation of oxygen upon S-4 --> S-0.									173	1	0	0	112	0	173			0006-2960			WOS:000071824600021	9454606

We reveal that these Ni-hG and Fe-hG catalysts can be combined in any proportion to produce a desired syngas ratio (1-10) across a wide potential range (-0.6 to -1.1 V vs RHE), required commercially for the Fischer-Tropsch (F-T) synthesis of liquid fuels and chemicals. These findings are in agreement with our density functional theory calculations, which reveal that CO selectivity increases with a reduction in N coordination with Ni, while unsaturated Fe-N-x sites favor the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). The potential of these catalysts for scale up is further demonstrated by the unchanged selectivity at elevated temperature and stability in a high-throughput gas diffusion electrolyzer, displaying a high-mass-normalized activity of 275 mA mg(-1) at a cell voltage of 2.5 V. Our results provide valuable insights into the implementation of a simple top-down approach for fabricating active undercoordinated single atom catalysts for decarbonized syngas generation.									22	0	0	0	0	0	21			1936-0851	1936-086X		WOS:000679406500090	34192868	
J	Jursinic, P; Govindjee								Effects of hydroxylamine and silicomolybdate on the decay in delayed light emission in the 6-100 mus range after a single 10 ns flash in pea thylakoids.								Photosynthesis research				3	3			161	77		10.1007/BF00032254				1982-Jan	1982	Measurements are reported on mus delayed light emission, following a single 10 ns excitation flash, in Alaska pea thylakoids treated with hydroxylamine (NH2OH) or with silicomolybdate. 1. In thylakoids treated with 2 mM NH2OH in the light, or in the dark, the quantum yield of delayed light emission is considerably enhanced. A 10 mus lifetime component of delayed light emission is not significantly changed, whereas a 50-70 mus lifetime component is increased. MnCl2 and diphenylcarbazide are unable to reverse the above effects of NH2OH treatment. Thus Mn(2+) and diphenylcarbazide must not donate electrons directly to reaction center II but on the oxygen-evolution side of the NH2OH block. 2. When the closed form of photosystem II reaction centers (P680Q(-)), where P680 is the reaction center chlorophyll and Q is a 'stable' electron acceptor, is generated by preillumination of NH2OH-treated thylakoids with diuron present, the mus delayed light emission is inhibited, but a low level residual delayed light emission remains. Possible origins of this emission are discussed. It is believed that the best explanation for residual DLE is the existence of another acceptor besides Q that partakes in charge separation and rapid dissipative recombination when the reaction center is in the P680Q(-) state. 3. The quantum yield of delayed light emission from 'closed' reaction centers (P680 (+)Q(-)) that have all charge stabilization reactions (i.e., flow of electrons to P680 (+) and out of Q(-)) blocked by NH2OH treatment and addition of diuron is 1.1*10(-3) for components measured in a range from 6 to 400 mus and extrapolated to zero time. 4. The addition of silicomolybdate, which accepts electron from Q(-), causes delayed light emission in the mus range to be greatly inhibited.									17	0	1	0	14	0	18			0166-8595			MEDLINE:24458283	24458283

Emerging issues that affect blood safety and blood supply, such as pathogen inactivation and more stringent donor screening questions, bring new pressures on the availability of an affordable blood supply. Imminent alternatives for management of anaemia, such as oxygen carriers, hold great promise but, if available, will require close oversight. With current estimates of HIV or hepatitis C viral (HCV) transmission approaching one in 2 000 000 units transfused, keeping to a minimum bacterial contamination of platelet products (one in 2000) and errors in transfusion, with its estimated one in 800 000 mortality rate, assume great urgency. Finally, serious difficulties in blood safety and availability for poor, developing countries require innovative strategies and commitment of resources.									182	11	3	0	86	6	199			0140-6736	1474-547X		WOS:000180428000026	12531595

American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) 51142 is capable of performing oxygenic photosynthesis during the day and microoxic nitrogen fixation at night. These mutually exclusive processes are possible only by temporal separation by circadian clock or another cellular program. We report identification of a temperature-dependent ultradian metabolic rhythm that controls the alternating oxygenic and microoxic processes of Cyanothece sp. ATCC 51142 under continuous high irradiance and in high CO2 concentration. During the oxygenic photosynthesis phase, nitrate deficiency limited protein synthesis and CO2 assimilation was directed toward glycogen synthesis. The carbohydrate accumulation reduced overexcitation of the photosynthetic reactions until a respiration burst initiated a transition to microoxic N-2 fixation. In contrast to the circadian clock, this ultradian period is strongly temperature-dependent: 17 h at 27 degrees C, which continuously decreased to 10 h at 39 degrees C. The cycle was expressed by an oscillatory modulation of net O-2 evolution, CO2 uptake, pH, fluorescence emission, glycogen content, cell division, and culture optical density. The corresponding ultradian modulation was also observed in the transcription of nitrogenase-related nifB and nifH genes and in nitrogenase activities. We propose that the control by the newly identified metabolic cycle adds another rhythmic component to the circadian clock that reflects the true metabolic state depending on the actual temperature, irradiance, and CO2 availability.									28	0	0	0	25	0	28			0027-8424			WOS:000322771100080	23878254

The results were obtained for a wide range of temperatures from -20 to 90 degrees C. The alpha parameter determined from the log k(fh) on E dependence corresponding to the Cr3+ + e(-) --> Cr2+ electrode process shows the highest dependence on temperature (partial derivative alpha/partial derivative T = 1.1 +/- 0.3 x 10(-3) K-1), whereas the beta parameter corresponding to the Cr2+ --> Cr3+ + e(-) electrode process is virtually independent of temperature (partial derivative beta/partial derivative T = 0). The same results were obtained when the transfer coefficients were determined from dependence of the enthalpy and entropy of activation on overpotential. The observed temperature dependence of alpha is attributed to the changes of the phi(2) potential. The transfer coefficients for the Cr2 + /0 electrode reaction also show some dependence on temperature (partial derivative alpha/partial derivative T = 8.7 +/- 2.0 x to 10(-4) K-1 and partial derivative beta/partial derivative T = 3.2 +/- 1.4 x 10(-4) K-1), which probably results from the influence of the phi(2) potential.

Herein, we reported the in situ synthesis of AgCo bimetallic nanoparticles supported on g-C3N4 and concomitant hydrolysis of ammonia borane for hydrogen evolution at room temperature. The as-synthesized Ag0.1Co0.9/g-C3N4 catalysts displayed the highest turnover frequency (TOF) value of 249.02 mol H-2 center dot(mol(Ag)center dot min)(-1) for hydrogen evolution from the hydrolysis of ammonia borane, which was higher than many other reported values. Furthermore, the Ag0.1Co0.9/g-C3N4 catalyst could be recycled during five consecutive runs. The study proves that Ag0.1Co0.9/g-C3N4 is a potential catalytic material toward the hydrolysis of ammonia borane for hydrogen production.									20	2	0	0	0	0	21			2079-4991			WOS:000435198300011	29701660	
J	Lewis, Bernard; Von Elbe, Guenther								On the Theory of Flame Propagation								JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL PHYSICS				2	8						10.1063/1.1749523				AUG 1 1934	1934	A new theory of flame propagation in slow inflammation is proposed which considers that the highly energized atoms or radicals formed in the flame front play a more important role than heat conductivity in bringing the unburned gas to the reacting state. A small number of atoms or radicals diffuse over into the unburned phase, there initiating the chemical reaction. This and other considerations allow one to propose that the sum of thermal and chemical energy per unit mass of gas in all layers from the burned phase to the unburned phase is constant. The fundamental equation for the velocity V of the flame is derived simply from the fact that the number of molecules of combustible gas entering the reaction zone ( flame front) in unit time equals the number reacting in the zone in the same time. If the flame front extends from xu to xb and the unburned gas enters it at a rate just sufficient to maintain the flame front stationary, then for 1 (cm) over bar (2) cross section the equation reads:VNc(u) = integral(xb)(Tu) - partial derivative Nc/partial derivative t dx/dT dTwhere V is the flame speed which is identical with the volume of unburned gaseous mixture (under initial conditions) entering the reaction zone per sec.; N-c(u) is the concentration of combustible gas in molecules/cc in the unburned phase; and Tb and Tu are temperatures of the completely burned and unburned gases at xb and Xu, respectively. This equation, in addition to the postulates that the sum of thermal and chemical energy per unit mass remains constant and that the rate of change of concentration of the various gas constituents in an elementary layer due to mass flow, diffusion and chemical reaction is zero, allows a solution of the problem. The theory is applied to explosions of mixtures of ozone gas and oxygen. Ozone decomposes to oxygen, with evolution of heat. With the help of the postulate that the total energy per unit mass is constant, the terms partial derivative Nc/partial derivative t and dx/dT can be expressed as functions of temperature alone, and the above equation can be solved. In view of certain simplifications the calculated velocities are considered to be in satisfactory agreement with the experimental velocities. The theory furnishes knowledge of the structure of the flame front. A particular explosion is analyzed. The width of its flame front is shown to be about 10(-3) cm. The temperature distribution, the distribution of the concentrations of various molecular and atomic species, and the rate of reaction throughout the flame front are given. The authors add an appendix, which includes a critical analysis of the essential differences between the present theory and previous theories of other investigators.									65	0	2	0	0	0	67			0021-9606			WOS:000208211800017

To be able to build high-performance fuel cells and electrocatalysts to meet energy demand, it is critical to develop abundant and cheap electrocatalysts to address fossil fuel reduction and the energy crisis. Current study reports the first investigation on nanocomposite of Zirconia and palladium oxide (ZrO2@PdO) as an electrode material synthesized by a biomimetic approach. Biosynthesized ZrO2@PdO nanocomposites had direct band gaps of 4.5 and 3.5 eV, as measured by ultraviolet spectrophotometry capped by organic functional groups as revealed by Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy. Formation of oxide nanoparticles was confirmed through UV-Vis spectroscopy with peaks exhibition between 300 and 400 nm. Polycrystalline phase patterns were determined by x-ray diffraction with average crystallite sizes of 12 nm. Scanning electron micrographs of nanocomposites revealed granular and uniform grain shapes, with strong signals for Zr, Pd, and O exposed by energy dispersive x-ray spectroscopy. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy successfully revealed the capping of phytocompounds (C1s) as well as confirmed the composition of material with strong signals of Pd, Zr, and O1s. Electrochemical investigation included linear sweep voltammetry and electrochemical impedance spectroscopic (EIS) studies. The electrode performed well, with low overpotential value as well as Tafel slope value (64 mV/dec), signifying its effectiveness as oxidation catalyst. The Nyquist plot from EIS with an arc radius demonstrated the occurrence of resistance mechanism arising from interfacial region of electrode surface with charge transfer resistance (R-ct) of only 3.23 omega. ZrO2@PdO did not perform well for hydrogen evolution reaction under the same operating conditions, however, can be improved by optimizing the parameters. Active to electrochemical application manifested ZrO2@PdO a potential candidate for photovoltaic devices in term of economic viability and sustainability in comparison to environmentally harmful pathways.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0363-907X	1099-114X		WOS:000757234200001

Due to the introduction of BCS, the MnO2/BCS shows hierarchical nanoflower-like morphology with a smaller particle size and higher specific surface area than that of pristine MnO2. Importantly, the resultant MnO2/BCS with proper addition of BCS displays superior OER performance than those of the pristine MnO2. The electrochemical measurement results demonstrate that the optimal MnO2/BCS0.08 can give rise to a lowest overpotential mere 170 mV at 10 mA-cm(-2), onset potential reaching 1.33 V together with smallest Tafel slope value of 31.43 mV dec(-1), which can be mainly due to the higher conductivity, faster charge transfer kinetics and higher electrocatalytic active sites of the MnO2/BCS0.08 than those of other counterparts. Undoubtedly, the incorporation of BCS is mainly responsible for the enhanced electrocatalytic activity. Furthermore, the MnO2/BCS0.08 also has a prominent long-term stability in alkaline conditions. In conclusion, our present work demonstrates an effective strategy to enhance the OER performance of MnO2 by incorporation of the carbon nanomaterials. (C) 2022 The Electrochemical Society ("ECS").

This has conventionally been addressed by coating it with a catalyst to increase the kinetics of the oxygen evolution reaction. However, surface recombination at trapping states is also thought to be an important factor for the overpotential, and herein we investigate a strategy to passivate trapping states using conformal overlayers applied by atomic layer deposition. While TiO2 overlayers show no beneficial effect, we find that an ultra-thin coating of Al2O3 reduces the overpotential required with state-of-the-art nano-structured photo-anodes by as much as 100 mV and increases the photocurrent by a factor of 3.5 (from 0.24 mA cm(-2) to 0.85 mA cm(-2)) at + 1.0 V vs. the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) under standard illumination conditions. The subsequent addition of Co2+ ions as a catalyst further decreases the overpotential and leads to a record photocurrent density at 0.9 V vs. RHE (0.42 mA cm(-2)). A detailed investigation into the effect of the Al2O3 overlayer by electrochemical impedance and photoluminescence spectroscopy reveals a significant change in the surface capacitance and radiative recombination, respectively, which distinguishes the observed overpotential reduction from a catalytic effect and confirms the passivation of surface states. Importantly, this work clearly demonstrates that two distinct loss processes are occurring on the surface of high-performance hematite and suggests a viable route to individually address them.									647	21	0	0	33	0	648			2041-6520	2041-6539		WOS:000288387600023

For the films on LaAlO3, the isotope substitution resulted in the reversible transition from a metal-like to insulating state. The applied magnetic field (H greater than or equal to 2 T) transformed the sample with O-18 back to the metallic state. The films on SrTiO3 remained metallic at low temperatures for both O-16 and O-18, but the shift of the resistivity peak corresponding to onset of metallic state exceeded 50 K at 3 T after O-16 --> O-18 substitution. This drastic difference in transport properties can be related to the substrate-induced strains having opposite signs for the films on LaAlO3 and SrTiO3. The temperature dependence of resistivity was characterized by hysteresis, especially pronounced in the case of the films on LaAlO3. Such a behavior gives certain indications of the phase separation characteristic of interplay between ferromagnetism and charge ordering.					8th European Magnetic Materials and Applications Conference (EMMA 2000)8th European Magnetic Materials and Applications Conference (EMMA 2000)	JUN 07-10, 2000JUN 07-10, 2000	Natl Acad Sci Ukraine; European Phys Soc; Minist Educ Ukraine; Sci & Technol Ctr; Off Naval Res Int Field Off, EuropeNatl Acad Sci Ukraine; European Phys Soc; Minist Educ Ukraine; Sci & Technol Ctr; Off Naval Res Int Field Off, Europe	KIEV, UKRAINEKIEV, UKRAINE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0255-5476		0-87849-880-X	WOS:000172513500131

Combined with a series of characterizations (XRD, SEM, BET, FTIR and UV-vis DRS), the results show that the addition of CTAB brings a lot of positive charges on the surface of N-OCN. According to the principle of electrostatic attraction, positively charged N-OCN negatively charged CdS attract each other, which strengthens the close contact between CdS and N-OCN and plays an important role in stabilizing the formation of heterojunction. CdS is anchored to N-OCN through electrostatic interaction. Under the irradiation of visible light, the electrons on CB on positively charged N-OCN combine with holes on negatively charged CdS valence band, which improves the redox ability in photocatalytic reaction system. Taking methyl orange (MO) as a pollutant degradation model, the possible degradation mechanism was discussed in detail. This study provides a simple, effective and wide application method for the modification of g-C3N4.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0009-2614	1873-4448		WOS:000799322300006

The obtained Cu-ZnO was continuously integrated with g-C3N4 to create Cu-ZnO/g-C3N4 Z-direct scheme photocatalyst for advanced atrazine removal. Radical scavenging experiments have been also conducted to clearly figure out photocatalytic mechanism for degradation of atrazine by the synthesized photocatalyst. The synthesized Cu-ZnO only utilized the generated h(+) for atrazine degradation (direct and indirect via formation hydroxyl radicals ((OH)-O-center dot)) and the g-C3N4 only utilized the generated e(-) for atrazine degradation (indirect via reaction with O-2 to form superoxide anion, which needed to continuously react with H2O to form (OH)-O-center dot). Therefore, the photocatalytic atrazine degradation by synthesized Cu-ZnO material was greater than that by synthesized g-C3N4 material. Cu-ZnO/g-C3N4 utilized both generated e(-) and h(+) for degradation of atrazine. Thus, the photocatalytic atrazine degradation by the synthesized Cu-ZnO/g-C3N4 was greater than those of single g-C3N4 or Cu-ZnO materials. Finally, the conducted recycling experiments indicated great stability of synthesized Cu-ZnO/g-C3N4 during long-term atrazine degradation process opening new era for application of the material in practical systems.									63	0	0	0	14	0	63			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000474530600094		
J	Hemida, AT; Pailler, R; Naslain, R								Continuous SiC-based model monofilaments with a low free carbon content .1. From the pyrolysis of a polycarbosilane precursor under an atmosphere of hydrogen								JOURNAL OF MATERIALS SCIENCE				32	9			2359	2366		10.1023/A:1018544805060				MAY 1 1997	1997	Pyrolysis of a Yajima-type polycarbosilane (PCS) has been performed under an atmosphere of hydrogen on both bulk samples and model monofilaments up to 1000 degrees C, in order to reduce the free carbon content of the resulting ceramics. The organic/inorganic transition occurs with in the 400-800 degrees C temperature range, with mainly an evolution of CH4. At 1000 degrees C, it yields an hydrogenated amorphous ceramic with a C/Si atomic ratio and a free carbon content significantly lower than for its counterpart obtained under inert atmosphere (namely, 1.18 and 9 at% versus 1.72 and 27 at%). Hydrogen is thought to favour the release of the pendent methyl groups of the PCS via demethanation radical reactions. Continuous model filaments were produced via the melt spinning of the PCS, electron beam curing, pyrolysis under hydrogen up to 1000 degrees C, and a final heat treatment under argon up to 1600 degrees C. The ceramic fibres exhibit a C/Si atomic ratio of 1.10, a free carbon content of approximate to 8 at%, a Young's modulus of 260-300 GPa and a tensile failure stress of 2100 MPa. Their thermal stability is limited to 1400 degrees C due to some oxygen contamination during the process.									28	5	0	0	0	0	30			0022-2461			WOS:A1997WY35000017

The tungsten oxide after removal of silica template was characterized by powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM). Investigations of optical and photoelectrochemical properties showed that the mesoporous WO3 was a n-type semiconductor with a band gap of 2.6 eV and demonstrated prompt, steady, and reproducible photocurrent responses during repeated on/off cycles of visible light illumination (lambda > 420 nm). The mesoporous WO3 modified by platinum nanoparticles could be used as a stable photocatalyst for photoinducing O-2 evolution. Under visible light irradiation, the average O-2 evolution rate is 34.5 mu mol g(-1) h(-1) in the presence of an electron acceptor IO3-. This work demonstrated a potential application of using mesoporous WO3 modified by platinum nanoparticles as a novel photocatalyst in the field of solar energy conversion. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

The phase purity and crystal structural changes were investigated with XRD, FTIR and Raman. The vibrational spectra reveal the interaction between metal cation and oxygen anion with increasing Li doping and structural evolution. LLTO and component oxides were studied by high temperature oxide melt solution calorimetry. The formation enthalpies of LLTO from oxides are exothermic for all compositions, indicating thermodynamic stability. There are two regimes in the trend of formation enthalpy with increasing Li concentration. In the first regime, x <= 0.08, the formation enthalpies vary slowly with composition, but the lowest stability by about 1.5 kJ mol(-1) is seen at x = 0.06. An abrupt change in the formation enthalpy trend is observed in the second regime when x >= 0.1, where maximum lithium ion conductivity (at x = 0.10) is reported. The least stable composition, x = 0.06, occurs where maximum charge carrier concentration and lowest activation energy is reported. From the thermodynamic study, it is clear that the energetically least stable composition correlates with lowest activation energy whereas the sharp change in formation enthalpy trend correlates with highest Li-ion conductivity.									14	1	0	0	0	0	15			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000404571500036

The introduction of light atomic species (e.g. , H, B, C, and N) into noble metal lattices plays an important role in optimizing catalytic performance by modulating structural and electronic properties. In this review, we present a general overview of the recent advances in the modification of noble metals with light alloying elements for various catalytic reactions, particularly for energy-related applications. We summarize the types, location, concentration, and ordering degree of light atoms as major factors in the performance of noble metal-based catalysts, with emphasis on how they can be rationally controlled to promote activity and selectivity. We then summarize the synthetic strategies developed to incorporate light elements and highlight the theoretical and experimental methods for understanding the alloying effects. We further focus on the wide usage of noble metal-based catalysts modified with different light alloying atoms and attempt to correlate the structural features with their catalytic performances. Finally, we discuss current challenges and future perspectives regarding the development of highly efficient noble metal-based catalysts modified with light elements.

J	Journois, D								Hemofiltration during cardiopulmonary bypass.								Minerva anestesiologica				65	6			427	32						1999-Jun	1999	Several factors combine to facilitate the evolution towards heart and multi-organ failure following cardiac surgery. Some of these factors are related to pure cardiac aspects like the existence of a preoperative heart disease, the use of aortic cross clamping or performance of cardiotomy. Cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) also plays an important role in the occurrence of postoperative organ dysfunctions by two principal means: firstly by inducing a profound hemodilution, which impairs oxygen transport through tissues. This phenomenon is pointed out in the postoperative period by the existence of increased transpulmonary O2 gradients, extravascular lung water volume and subsequent impairments of O2 transport. Secondly CPB is deleterious by triggering an important inflammatory reaction. This reaction is largely related to the ratio of the circuit area to the patient's body surface area and is therefore maximal in children. It has been widely demonstrated that the very early paths of this reaction imply several humoral factors including kinins, coagulation factor-XII and complement fragments. The activation of these factors is self-amplified and triggers both expression and release of numerous mediators by endothelial cells and leukocytes. Finally, these mediators are responsible for the well described "post-bypass syndrome" which is, from a clinical viewpoint, very close to hyperkinetic septic shocks. Several methods have been proposed to reduce the deleterious effects of both cardiac surgery and CPB. The older one is hypothermia that considerably reduces the triggering of the inflammatory mediators network. Heparin-coated circuits may also reduce this reaction to some extent. Hemofiltration has been introduced in the 90's in CPB management. Because of its very high tolerance in patients with compromised circulatory status this technique was already used in the postoperative period to treat patients with acute renal failure. Initially hemofiltration was intended to correct the accumulation of extravascular water during or immediately following the surgical procedure. Nevertheless several of its "side-effects" appeared to be useful like reduction of postoperative blood loss and immediate hemodynamics improvement. Several studies attempted to point out the mechanism of action of hemofiltration and although removal of inflammatory mediator occurs, there is currently no proofs that this removal is the actual mechanism by which this technique acts. At the early beginning of the use of its utilization hemofiltration during cardiac surgery aimed either to concentrate blood at the end of the procedure or to rapidly restore a normal fluid and electrolytes balance. Today some new implementations of this technique are proposed either to reduce the triggering of the inflammatory reaction to CPB or to reduce the immediate postoperative drug support.									8	1	0	0	3	0	11			0375-9393			MEDLINE:10394814	10394814

Appropriate pretreatment on MWCNTs could generate oxygen-containing groups, which is beneficial for forming intimate contact between MWCNTs and TiO2 and leads to a higher thermal stability of MWCNT-TiO2 nanocomposite. Modification with MWCNTs can extend the visible-light absorption of TiO2. 5wt% MWCNT-TiO2 derived from hydrothermal treatment at 140 degrees C exhibiting the highest hydrogen generation rate of 15.1 mu mol.h(-1) under visible-light irradiation and a wide photoresponse range from 350 to 475 nm with moderate quantum efficiency (4.4% at 420 nm and 3.7% at 475 nm).

Affordability, scalability, and high chemical stability are some valuable characteristics making woven stainless steel wire mesh a suitable substrate for fabrication of photocatalyst film. The photocatalytic degradation efficiency of the thin film was investigated by removing hard-degradable methamphetamine under natural solar light. The AgCl@TiO2 photocatalyst with AgCl content of about 5% showed the most photocatalytic degradation efficiency. Using Mott-Schottky plots, the flat band potential of prepared photocatalysts was estimated. The flat band potential showed that the conduction band of AgCl@TiO2 is a better candidate for production of superoxide radicals than TiO2. A film thickness of 1629 nm yields optimal photodegradation efficiency. A series of ten sequential cycles for photodegradation of methamphetamine was conducted using thin film which caused neither significant destruction on photocatalytic substrate nor any considerable reduction in efficiency whatsoever. The AgCl@TiO2 thin film-induced mineralization of methamphetamine was reported to be approximately around 91 percent. The photoelectrochemical performance of TiO2 and AgCl@TiO2 thin film was evaluated by LSV technique under solar light and results show that after incorporation of AgCl, the photocurrent density corresponding to the oxygen evolution reaction significantly increased to 1.8 mA cm(-2) at 1.23 V vs RHE.									26	1	0	0	1	0	27			0038-092X	1471-1257		WOS:000510072100064

Geitl, and Chlorella vulgaris Beijerinck cells were measured after adaptation to various growth irradiances (I) by means of the delayed fluorescence (DF) induction curves. Maxima of the membrane potential expenses during induction period were observed at I half saturating oxygen evolution; they were shifted according to growth I remaining higher in Spirulina than in Chlorella. The alterations of absorbance and fluorescence spectra at 25 degrees C after adaptation to I demonstrated changes in composition of pigments of algae, created to compensate for the imbalance in radiation absorption between the two photosystems. For Spirulina cells, the value of E was higher after growing under low I, or under blue radiation absorbed mainly by photosystem (PS) 1 (400-500 nm) with excitation by yellow (570 nm) radiation. For Chlorella cells, it was also higher after growing under low I. Under such conditions the half-rise time for DP-phase of DF induction curve decreased, which reflected an acceleration of kinetics of the initial electron transport between photosystems. An opposite situation was observed with Spirulina cells grown under high I or yellow radiation, and Chlorella cells from high I. Enhancement of effective PS2/PS1 ratio associated with decrease of reaction centre (RC) 2/RC1 stoichiometry may be a cause of the increase of E and high membrane energization under saturating I in algae adapted to low I.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0300-3604			WOS:A1995QU98700013

A YSZ-Pt cathode with high electronic conductivity along the cathode plane and with high oxygen ionic conductivity in the direction perpendicular to the electrocatalytic electrode through the cathode to the YSZ solid electrolyte was successfully designed. The conductivity of the YSZ-Pt cathode was investigated and correlated with the composition of the cathode using the two-dimensional percolation model. The optimum cathode composition (YSZ less than or equal to 50% by volume) resulted in a decrease of the cell operating voltage and a decrease in the electrical power required for NO decomposition. The electrochemical properties of a cell with a multilayer electrode for NO decomposition were investigated and correlated with the composition of the cathode. Structure evolution of the NiO-YSZ electrocatalytic electrode was studied by X-ray diffraction and correlated with the YSZ((X))- Pt(1-X) cathode composition. It was found that the highest rate of reduction of NiO into Ni in the NiO/YSZ interface regions occurred at the optimum cathode composition.

Real-time observation during separate oxidation and reduction processes provides nanometer-scale structural details - both morphology and chemistry - of supported Pt/Pd particles at intermediate states not observable through typical ex situ experiments. Significant metal vaporization was observed at temperatures above 600 degrees C, both in pure oxygen and in air. This behavior implies that material transport through the vapor during typical catalyst aging processes for oxidation can play a more significant role in catalyst structural evolution than previously thought. Concomitantly, Pd diffusion away from metallic nanoparticles on the surface of Al2O3 can also contribute to the disappearance of metal particles. Electron micrographs from in situ oxidation experiments were mined for data, including particle number, size, and aspect ratio using machine learning image segmentation. Under oxidizing conditions, we observe not only a decrease in the number of metal particles but also a decrease in the surface area to volume ratio. Some of the metal that diffuses away from particles on the oxide support can be regenerated and reappears back on the catalyst support surface under reducing conditions. These observations provide insight on how rapid cycling between oxidative and reductive catalytic operating conditions affects catalyst structure.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000664683200001	34160525

Aquatic invertebrates are especially important in ecosystems due to their central role in secondary production and in dynamics of food webs. To better understand impacts of oxygen availability on key physiological processes in invertebrates, we conducted a literature search and synthesized the findings of published studies. We found 55 studies that quantified impacts of hypoxia on feeding, growth, reproduction and respiration rates in 54 different aquatic invertebrate species. We applied non-linear regression models which took into account phylogenetic correlation in the data set. Fitting Michaelis-Menten models, we found that there were differences in how different processes responded to a decline in oxygen availability. Respiration rates were halved at highest oxygen concentration (6.44 mg O-2/L), followed by reproductive (3.66 mg O-2/L), growth (1.77 mg O-2/L) and, finally, feeding rates (0.77 mg O-2/L). Our findings confirm observations that reproduction is highly sensitive as organisms quickly reduce their reproductive output when exposed to stressful conditions. As long as they have sufficient reserves, organisms continue growing even under stressful conditions, and we confirmed that growth was not very sensitive to a decline in oxygen availability. We discuss potential impacts of global warming on oxygen availability and demand for aquatic macroinvertebrates. Given that oxygen availability is declining in many ecosystems, we can expect that organismal responses will be increasingly compromised with potential consequences for ecosystems and the services they deliver.

However, the practical large-scale application of the unassisted APS devices is impeded by the need for expensive noble metal-based catalysts in photovoltaics and/or electrolyzers. Herein, well-aligned 2D NixSy nanowalls (2D NixSy NWs) on a 3D nitrogen-doped graphene foam (3D NGF) are synthesized and further employed it in unassisted APS. Due to the positive synergistic effect between the highly electrocatalytic activity of NixSy NW and excellent conductivity of NGF, this low cost material of (2D/3D) NixSy NW/NGF is highly efficient as a multifunctional catalyst in various applications: a counterelectrode for dye-sensitized solar cell (DSSC) and a "bifunctional" electrocatalyst for oxygen and hydrogen evolution for electrocatalytic overall water splitting. Furthermore, three NixSy NW/NGF-based DSSCs as a tandem cell for unassisted solar-driven overall water splitting is connected, using NixSy NW/NGF itself on nickel foams as the anode and cathode. Impressively, such integrated photovoltaic-electrolyzer APS device can achieve an STH efficiency of 3.2% with an excellent stability and low cost. This work opens an avenue to advanced multifunctional materials for the low-cost and unassisted solar-driven overall water splitting.									64	7	0	0	4	0	64			1616-301X	1616-3028		WOS:000428792200027

Herein, the LiCoO2 was synthesized and used to treat the simulated dye wastewater. In order to cope with the practical water pollution, the effects of rhodamine B (RhB) concentration, concomitant ions, solution pH, air blowing and reaction temperature were systematically investigated. The most important finding of this study is the in situ nitrogenization of the LiCoO2 via RhB degradation, which offered the reused material a much better activity than the fresh one due to the formation of more defect oxygen species, and the activity of the reused LiCoO2 became better and better with cycling runs. At the third time of usage, similar to 0% of RhB could be removed under the conditions of 0.2 g of catalyst, 50 mL of 5 mg.L-1 RhB solution and 30 degrees C whereas only similar to 60% of RhB was degraded over the fresh sample. The results of this study will also have scientific significance for the development of nitrogen-doped LiCoO2 in other application fields.									3	0	0	0	1	0	3			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000496923200012

Thermal and hydrothermal stability of pure and silica-doped mesoporous aluminas								MICROPOROUS AND MESOPOROUS MATERIALS				284				60	68		10.1016/j.micromeso.2019.04.005				AUG 2019	2019	Thermal and hydrothermal stabilities of solvent deficient derived pure alumina (PA) as well as silica-doped aluminas (SDA) with three different dopant concentrations (5, 15, 27% by weight) have been investigated for changes in phase and pore structure after calcination at high temperatures under air and steam/air atmospheres. For all aluminas, heat treatment results in decreased surface area and increased pore diameter. Starting at 700 degrees C, metastable to stable phase transformation occurs, causing a substantial change in the pore structure of all aluminas. By 1100 (PA), 1200 (15 SDA) and 1200 degrees C (27 SDA), the transition to alpha-Al2O3 was complete, respectively. No alpha-Al2O3 is observed for 5 wt % silica doped alumina (5SDA) under thermal calcination. Calcination in steam and air, instead of in air only, results in enlarged pore size and depressed temperature of alpha phase transformation for all aluminas. Results show that the silica dopant modifies the pores of the alumina, stabilizes the oxygen lattice of gamma-Al2O3, and retards alpha-Al2O3 formation. This study of the thermal and hydrothermal stability not only suggests the applicability of 5SDA for catalytic reactions occurring at high temperature in the presence of steam, but also contributes to a better understanding of the structural features responsible for the improved thermal stability of these aluminas.									14	0	0	0	1	0	14			1387-1811	1873-3093		WOS:000469893200008

Using a pET-T7 cloning/expression system, we have expressed in Escherichia coli a full-length cDNA clone of psbO from A rabidopsis thaliana. Upon induction, high levels of the precursor protein accumulated in cells grown with vigorous aeration. In cells grown under weak aeration, the mature protein accumulated upon induction. In cells grown with moderate aeration, the ratio of precursor to mature MSP decreased as the optical density at induction increased. Both forms of the protein accumulated as inclusion bodies from which the mature protein could be released under mildly denaturing conditions that did not release the precursor. Renatured Arabidopsis MSP was 87% as effective as isolated spinach MSP in restoring O-2 evolution activity to MSP-depleted PSII membranes from spinach; however, the heterologous protein binds to spinach PSIIs with about half the affinity of the native protein.

It is shown that under certain conditions, hydrogen can be stored in irradiated nickel and stainless steels at levels strongly in excess of that predicted by Sieverts' law. These conditions are first, the availability of hydrogen from various radiolytic and environmental sources and second, the formation of radiation-induced cavities to store hydrogen. These cavities can be highly pressurized bubbles or under-pressurized voids, with concurrent helium in the cavities at either low or very high levels. Transmutant sources of hydrogen are often insufficient to pressurize these cavities, and therefore environmental sources are required. The stored hydrogen appears to be stable for many years at room temperature. A conceptual model to describe such behavior requires the continuous generation of hydrogen from (n,p) reactions and possibly other radiolytic sources which can create a supersaturation of hydrogen in the metal, leading to the pressurization of voids and helium bubbles. Once captured in a bubble, the hydrogen is assumed to be in molecular form. Dissolution back into the metal requires chemisorption and dissociation on the bubble surface. Both of these processes have large activation barriers, particularly when oxygen, carbon, and other impurities poison the bubble surface. However, these chemisorbed poisons may reduce but not entirely restrict the ingress or egress of atomic hydrogen.

J	Siron, Chris R.; Thompson, John F. H.; Baker, Tim; Darling, Robert; Dipple, Gregory								Origin of Au-Rich Carbonate-Hosted Replacement Deposits of the Kassandra Mining District, Northern Greece: Evidence for Late Oligocene, Structurally Controlled, and Zoned Hydrothermal Systems								ECONOMIC GEOLOGY				114	7	SI		1389	1414		10.5382/econgeo.4664				NOV 1 2019	2019	The Au-rich polymetallic massive sulfide orebodies of the Kassandra mining district belong to the intrusion- related carbonate-hosted replacement deposit class. Marble lenses contained within the Stratoni fault zone host die Madem Lakkos and Mavres Petres deposits at the eastern end of the fault system, where paragenetieally early skarn and massive sulfide are spatially associated with late Oligocene aplitic and porphyritic dikes. Skarn transitions into predominant massive and banded replacement sulfide bodies, which are overprinted by a younger assemblage of boulangerite-bearing, quartz-rich sulfide and late quartz-rhodoehrosite vein breccias. The latter style of mineralization is most abundant at the Piavitsa prospect at the western end of the exposed fault system. The sulfide orebodies at the Olympias deposit are hosted by marble in association with the Kassandra fault, where textural and mineralogical similarities to the sulfide bodies within the Stratoni fault zone suggest a genetic relationship. Estimated trapping temperatures and pressures based on fluid inclusion data indicate that carbonate replacement mineralization took place at depths less than about 5.9 km.Carbon and oxygen isotope patterns in carbonate from the Stratoni fault zone support isotopic exchange principally through fluid-wall-rock interaction, whereas decarbonation and fluid-rock exchange reactions were important: at. the Olympias deposit. Carbonate minerals associated with skarn and replacement sulfide throughout the district have isotopic compositions that arc consistent with formation from a hydrothermal fluid of magmatic origin. Lower homogenization temperatures and salinities in the younger quartz-rich sulfide assemblage and quartz-rhodoehrosite vein breccias, together with low delta O-18 values of gangue carbonate, suggest dilution of a primary magmatic fluid with meteoric writer late in the evolution of the hydrothermal system in both the Olympias area and the Stratoni fault zone. The replacement sulfide orebodies in the district likely inherited their uniform Pb isotope composition from a late Oligocene igneous source and the isotopically heterogeneous metamorphic basement units.Metal distribution patterns at die scale of the Stratoni fault zone show diminishing Cu concentration with decreasing Pb/Zn and Ag/Au ratios from Madem Lakkos to Mavres Petres and the Piavitsa prospect in the west. The sulfide orebodies at. the Olympias deposit exhibit elevated Cu values in the east: with increasing Pb/Zn and Ag/Au ratios down-plunge to the south-southwest. Metal concentration and ratios support zoning related to temperature and solubility changes with increasing distance from a probable magmatic source. Structural and igneous relationships, together with fluid inclusion microthermometric and carbon-oxygen isotope data and metal distribution patterns, are supportive of a zoned hydrothermal system that exceeded 12 km along the Stratoni fault zone, sourced by an igneous intrusion to the southeast of the Madem Lakkos deposit. The Olympias replacement sulfide orebodies, associated with the Kassandra fault, resulted from a local hydrothermal system that was likely derived from a concealed igneous intrusion to the east of the deposit.									7	0	0	0	0	0	7			0361-0128	1554-0774		WOS:000489037200008

The ZnO nanorod arrays were prepared by a facile hydrothermal approach and sulphurized to form ZnS shell. Subsequently porous Bi2S3 nanosheets were arbitrarily decorated on the nanorod arrays by ionic adsorption and reaction method. Substantial enhancement in photocurrents with twofold increment is observed for hybrid photoanode compared to pristine counterparts. The structural and morphological properties of nano hybrid Bi2S3/ZnS/ZnO samples were analyzed by field emission scanning electron microscopy and X-ray diffraction. The higher wavelength shift in the absorption edge of Bi2S3/ZnS/ZnO photocatalyst was observed in diffuse reflectance UV-Visible spectra. The low temperature photoluminescence and impedance spectra of Bi2S3/ZnS/ZnO photoanode confirm that Bi2S3 functionalization reduces the recombination of electron-hole pair and facilitates barrier free charge transfer. The Bi2S3/ZnS/ZnO photoanode device exhibits photocurrent density of 220 mu A/cm(2) at 0.2 V vs. Ag/AgCl under the electrolyte solution at pH similar to 10.8. The resultant hybrid photoanode withhold good stability and maintain the facile charge carrier generation and separation. Bi2S3 topological nanosheets are responsible for the absorption of complete visible photons while ZnS/Bi2S3 inter-junction provides the robust electronhole pair separation at their interface due to infiltration pathway. The photoactive hybridization of Bi2S3/ZnS/ZnO provokes the enhanced donor charge density for efficient hydrogen evolution reaction. (C) 2020 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC.

Catalase is one of the regulatory enzymes and facilitates the degradation of hydrogen peroxide to oxygen and water. Biochemical information on an insect catalase is, however, insufficient. Using mRNA from fat body of the silkworm, Bombyx mori, a cDNA encoding a putative catalase was amplified by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction and sequenced. The deduced amino acid sequence comprised 507 residues with more than seventy residues forming a scaffold for a heme cofactor conserved. The sequence showed 71% and 66% identities to those of the Drosophila melanogaster and Apis mellifera catalases, respectively; the catalase from B. mori was estimated to be phylogenetically close to that from A. mellifera. The transcripts of the gene and the catalase activity were distributed in diverse tissues of B. mori, suggesting its ubiquitous nature. Using the gene, a recombinant catalase (rCAT) was functionally overexpressed in a soluble form using Escherichia coli, purified to homogeneity, and characterized. The pH-optimum of rCAT was broad around pH 8.0. More than 80% of the original rCAT activity was retained after incubation in the following conditions: at pH 8-11 and 4 degrees C for 24 h; at pH 7 and temperatures below 50 degrees C for 30 min. The Michaelis constant for hydrogen peroxide was evaluated to be 28 mM at pH 6.5 and 30 degrees C. rCAT was suggested to be a member of the typical catalase family. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

The hybrid material shows promising results as an electrocatalyst for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). By varying Pt synthesis conditions-precursor loading and TA temperature-the deposition sites, size, and morphology of the Pt nanostructure can be controlled. The size effect of a Pt nanoparticle on catalytic activity and sintering resistance is discussed. Results show that higher Pt loading yields better HER performance despite smaller specific surface area; higher TA temperature delivers larger average particle size of Pt crystals and lower HER activity. Larger average size leads to fast sintering and thus poor durability of the catalyst. On the basis of the correlation between HER performance and growth behaviors of Pt on MoS2 surfaces, an optimization route for a highly active and stable cocatalyst can be established. The optimized Pt-MoS2 catalyst (400 degrees C, 11 wt %) reported in this study possesses superior overpotential of 9 mV (close to zero), Tafel slope of 44 mV/dec, and moderate exchange current density of 373 mu A/cm(2); it exhibits activity degradation of 140 mV @ 20 mA/cm(2) after 10 000 cycles. The Tafel slope indicates the combination of Volmer-Heyrovsky steps as HER mechanism in this particular hybrid catalyst system. The outstanding HER activity attributes to highly dispersed Pt nanoparticles grown on MoS2 basal surfaces, large MoS2 edge density, and Pt-S bonding effect induced activity improvement of MoS2 as well as 3D porous network assisted superaerophobic surface.									28	2	0	0	0	0	29			0897-4756	1520-5002		WOS:000456749800011

(American ginseng)								PLANTA				215	6			969	979		10.1007/s00425-002-0839-9				OCT 2002	2002	To identify physiological processes that might limit photosynthesis in Panax quinquefolius L. (American ginseng) a comparison has been made with Panax ginseng C.A. Meyer (Korean ginseng), Pisum sativum L. (pea) and Spinacia oleracea L. (spinach). The quantum yield of oxygen evolution in intact leaves and isolated thylakoid membranes was found to be smaller in ginseng than in pea or spinach. However, the number of photosystem II (PSII) centers on a chlorophyll basis was found to be similar in all species. This suggests that ginseng thylakoid membranes possess relatively more inactive PSII centers than thylakoids of pea and spinach when grown under similar conditions. Unexpectedly, whole-chain electron transport from water to methyl viologen, and partial photosystem I reactions, demonstrated that electron transport rates to methyl viologen were anomalously low in P. quinqufolius and P. ginseng. Additionally, at elevated light intensities, intact leaves of P. quinquefolius were more susceptible to lipid peroxidation than pea leaves. In plants grown at a light intensity of 80 mumol photons m(-2) s(-1) the levels of fructose and starch were higher in both ginseng species than in pea or spinach. Significantly, the level of starch in P. quinquefolius was relatively constant throughout the entire 12 h/12 h light/dark cycle and remained high after an extended dark time of 48 h. In addition, P. quinquefolius had lower activities of alpha-amylase and beta-amylase than P. ginseng, pea and Arabidopsis thaliana (L.) Heynh. The significance of the elevated levels of leaf starch in P. quinquefolius remains to be determined. However, the susceptibility of P. quinquefolius to photoinhibition may arise as a consequence of a reduced fraction of active PSII centers. This may result in the normal dissipative mechanisms in these plants becoming saturated at elevated, but moderate, light intensities.									15	0	0	0	12	0	16			0032-0935	1432-2048		WOS:000178995100010	12355157

The incorporation of Ru into the [Co3O4] subcluster via the single-step assembly reaction of Co-II(OAc)(2)(H2O)(4) (OAc = acetate), perruthenate (RuO4-), and pyridine (py) yielded an unprecedented Ru(O)Co-3(mu(3)-O)(4)(OAc)(4)(py)(3) cubane featuring an isolable, yet reactive, Ru-V-oxo moiety. EPR, ENDOR, and DFT studies reveal a valence-localized [Ru-V(S = 1/2)Co-3(III)(S = 0)O-4] configuration and non-negligible covalency in the cubane core. Significant oxyl radical character in the Ru-V-oxo unit is experimentally demonstrated by radical coupling reactions between the oxo cubane and both 2,4,6-tri-tert-butylphenoxyl and trityl radicals. The oxo cubane oxidizes organic substrates and, notably, reacts with water to form an isolable mu-oxo bis-cubane complex [(py)(3)(OAc)(4)Co-3(mu(3)-O)(4)Ru]-O-[RuCo3(mu(3)-O)(4)(OAc)(4)(py)(3)]. Redox activity of the Ru-V-oxo fragment is easily tuned by the electron-donating ability of the distal pyridyl ligand set at the Co sites demonstrating strong electronic communication throughout the entire cubane cluster. Natural bond orbital calculations reveal cooperative orbital interactions of the [Co3O4] unit in supporting the Ru-V-oxo moiety via a strong pi-electron donation.									18	0	0	0	1	0	18			0002-7863	1520-5126		WOS:000503917800045	31697896

However, some technical and scientific problems preventing the large-scale development of Al-air batteries have not yet to be resolved. In this review, we present the fundamentals, challenges and the recent advances in Al-air battery technology from aluminum anode, air cathode and electro-catalysts to electrolytes and inhibitors. Firstly, the alloying of aluminum with transition metal elements is reviewed and shown to reduce the self-corrosion of Al and improve battery performance. Additionally for the cathode, extensive studies of electrocatalytic materials for oxygen reduction/evolution including Pt and Pt alloys, nonprecious metal catalysts, and carbonaceous materials at the air cathode are highlighted. Moreover, for the electrolyte, the application of aqueous and nonaqueous electrolytes in Al-air batteries are discussed. Meanwhile, the addition of inhibitors to the electrolyte to enhance electrochemical performance is also explored. Finally, the challenges and future research directions are proposed for the further development of Al-air batteries. (C) 2017, Institute of Process Engineering, Chinese Academy of Sciences.

J	Manh-Hiep Vu; Toan-Anh Quach; Trong-On Do								The construction of Ru-doped In2O3 hollow peanut-like structure for an enhanced photocatalytic nitrogen reduction under solar light irradiation								SUSTAINABLE ENERGY & FUELS				5	9			2528	2536		10.1039/d1se00257k		MAR 2021		MAY 7 2021	2021	The synthesis of metal-organic framework (MOF) materials has been considered as an effective strategy for the design and fabrication of various nanostructured metal-based functional photocatalysts recently. Herein, Ru-doped In2O3 hollow peanuts (denoted as Ru-In2O3 HPNs) derived from MIL-68-In(Ru) precursor calcined in air was employed as an efficient photocatalytic system for the photoreduction of nitrogen. The TEM images revealed the uniform distribution of In2O3 nanoparticles, which are in situ-assembled to form a hollow peanut structure. Accordingly, this tailored nanostructure facilitates the separation and transportation of photoinduced electron-hole pairs and favor light harvesting by multi-reflection/scattering. Moreover, Ru dopants are intentionally introduced into the In2O3 semiconductor as active sites, which not only narrows the bandgap energy but also causes the formation of abundant oxygen vacancies (OVs), promoting the photocatalytic reduction reaction. As a result, the unique structure of Ru-In2O3 exhibited the highest photocatalytic activity of 44.5 mu mol g(-1) h(-1) for ammonia production under solar-light irradiation, which is 5.7-times and much higher than that of pure In2O3 hollow peanuts and bulk In2O3, respectively. Further, Ru-In2O3 HPNs exhibited excellent stability for photocatalytic nitrogen fixation by showing no obvious activity decay for six consecutive two-hour tests (12 h). This work might open up some insights into the target-directed design of hollow materials for the photocatalytic nitrogen fixation.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			2398-4902			WOS:000639580800001

However, to support high density of atomic iron active sites on conductive carbon supports, such as carbon nanotubes (CNTs), relies on templates to avoid aggregation of iron atoms. Here, a simple and template-free method has been developed to prepare high density iron single atoms supported CNTs. The FeSA with an atomic Fe loading of 3.5 wt% shows an onset potential (E-on) of 0.95 V and a half-wave potential (E-1/2) of 0.801 V for ORR in O-2-saturated 0.1 M HClO4 solution, which is comparable to that of Pt/C (Pt loading of 25 mu g(Pt) cm(-2)). The high ORR performance is resulted from the high-density atomic sites and the highly conductive CNTs-graphene networks. Most importantly, the FeSA exhibits a E-1/2 of 0.80 V, 27 mV more positive than that of Pt/C in 0.2 M H3PO4+0.1M HClO4 electrolyte due to its high phosphate resistance ability. The applicability of as-synthesized FeSA catalysts as precious metal group (PGM)-free cathode has been demonstrated in a HT-PEMFC, delivering a peak power density of 266 mW cm(-2) and excellent stability at 240 degrees C using anhydrous H-2 as fuel. The method provides a facile and practical route for developing highly efficient PGM-free catalysts for HT-PEMFCs.									20	1	0	0	1	0	21			2211-2855	2211-3282		WOS:000618006100005

In the absence of hydrogen, the fuel that powers these detonations typically consists of either pure helium (He) or a mixture of carbon and oxygen (C/O). Studies that systematically determine the conditions required to initiate detonations in C/O material exist, but until now no analogous investigation of He matter has been conducted. We perform one-dimensional reactive hydrodynamical simulations at a variety of initial density and temperature combinations and find critical length scales for the initiation of He detonations that range between 1 and 10(10) cm. A simple estimate of the length scales over which the total consumption of fuel will occur for steady-state detonations is provided by the Chapman-Jouguet (CJ) formalism. Our initiation lengths are consistently smaller than the corresponding CJ length scales by a factor of similar to 100, providing opportunities for thermonuclear explosions in a wider range of low-mass white dwarfs (WDs) than previously thought possible. We find that virialized WDs with as little mass as 0.24 M-circle dot can be detonated, and that even less massive WDs can be detonated if a sizable fraction of their mass is raised to a higher adiabat. That the initiation length is exceeded by the CJ length implies that certain systems may not reach nuclear statistical equilibrium within the time it takes a detonation to traverse the object. In support of this hypothesis, we demonstrate that incomplete burning will occur in the majority of He WD detonations and that Ca-40, Ti-44, or Cr-48, rather than Ni-56, is the predominant burning product for many of these events. We anticipate that a measure of the quantity of the intermediate-mass elements and Ni-56 produced in a helium-rich thermonuclear explosion can potentially be used to constrain the nature of the progenitor system.									35	1	0	0	0	0	35			0004-637X	1538-4357		WOS:000321274200014

Previous works, however, have mainly focused on engineering surface electronic properties, which undoubtedly activates their inherent catalytic power, but is not representative when it comes to practical applications. In this work, we successfully control the assembled structure of atomically thin CoSe2 nanomaterials for water oxidation catalysis. The results show that the large nanobelt structure exhibits a low overpotential of 362.5 mV at 10 mA cm(-2), a high current density of 34.2 mA cm(-2) at 400 mV, a small Tafel slope of 57.6 mV dec(-1), and excellent catalytic stability, significantly outperforming other assembled structures and previously reported results. The electrode constructed from large nanobelts possesses a porous structure with highly accessible channels that allows facile electrolyte diffusion and efficient mass transfer. In addition, the large nanobelts have better electronic contact with the current collector, which facilitates the charge transport and mass conversion processes. The manipulation of the assembled structure provides a new approach to the design of highly efficient catalysts for various reactions.									20	4	0	0	2	0	21			2211-2855	2211-3282		WOS:000458419000037

However, the associated oxygen release and structure collapse resulting from the intrinsic anion and cation redox reactions lead to performance degradation, particularly the characteristic voltage fading which has prohibited the commercialization of LLOs for more than a decade. Herein, we have developed a dual-doping technique to overcome the longstanding structure and voltage instabilities of Co-free Li1.2Mn0.533Ni0.267O2, through the concurrent introduction of neodymium (Nd) and aluminum (Al) ions. Selective atomic substitution of Ni/Mn with Nd/Al ions and the preconstructed heteroepitaxial interface significantly enhance the voltage and capacity retention by regulating Ni ion activity and suppressing the phase transformation and Mn dissolution, thereby improving rate performance through tuning the electronic structure and promoting Li+ migration. The dual-doped material exhibits a superior cycling stability, with over 90% voltage retention and 82% capacity retention after 200 cycles, and excellent rate performance (150 mAh g(-1) at 10 C).									37	3	0	0	1	0	39			2405-8297			WOS:000577179100005

Its main advantages are short processing-time (similar to 1 h) and low processing-temperature (similar to 100 degrees C). The underlying curing mechanism was investigated by performing TG-DTA, GC-MS, solid-state NMR, FTIR, FE-EPMA, ESR, elemental analysis, and XRD. The results indicate that the curing reaction occurs upon diffusion of iodine into the PCS, where iodine plays the critical role of accelerating the cleavage of Si-H (mainly), Si-Si, and C-H bonds. This cleavage coincides with recombination to form cross-linked networks of -Si-C- and -C=C-. The by-products were identified as oligomeric silanes, iodomethane, and aromatics. When the curing is conducted in air, the surface region in contact with oxygen is heavily oxidized to form a Si-O-Si network that is localized on the surface.									23	1	0	0	0	0	23			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000331247500043

(1994) Biochem. Soc. Trans. 22, 318-322], Based on these results it is inferred that photosynthetic dioxygen formation comprises the cleavage of at least one hydrogen bond.									64	0	0	0	48	0	64			0014-5793			WOS:A1996TP29900008	8549820

However, the full-length cDNA sequence and genomic organization of human neuroglobin have not been reported. In this paper, the full-length cDNA sequence of human neuroglobin was cloned following bioinformatic analysis and the rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) technique. It was shown that the full-length cDNA sequence (GenBank Accession No. AF422796) of human neuroglobin is 1909 bp in size, and the genomic sequence is 8041 bp in size (GenBank Accession No. AF422797). To further study the characterization of this gene, the coding region of rat neuroglobin (GenBank Accession No. AF333245) was cloned by using degeneracy PCR. The result showed high conservation among human, rat, and mouse neuroglobin. Furthermore, it was demonstrated that NGB was extensively expressed in rat brain by using in situ hybridization and the immunohistochemical technique. Transcription of NGB mRNA was shown to be widely distributed throughout the adult rat brain, including cerebral cortex, hippocampus, thalamus, hypothalamus, olfactory bulb, and cerebellum. NGB protein immunoreactive cells were also widely distributed throughout normal adult rat brain, including cerebral cortex, hippocampus, thalamus, hypothalamus, pons, and cerebellum. It could be seen that the NGB-immunopositive signals were in the cytoplasma and processes of the neuron. These data strongly support the notion that neuroglobin is a highly conserved gene in evolution and is very important in the nervous system, possibly related to the oxygen supply of the neuron.

Both NiO and NiS thin films demonstrate temperature-independent growth rates per cycle of 0.128 nm/ cycle and 0.0765 nm/cycle, at 130-150 degrees C and 80-160 degrees C, respectively. Comparison of two nickel-based thin film materials demonstrates dissimilar deposition features depending on the reactivity of the Ni precursor, i.e., Ni (dmamb)2 with anion sources provided by the water and hydrogen sulfide reactants. Difference in reactivity observed for NiO and NiS ALD processes is further investigated by density functional theory (DFT) simulations of surface reactions, which indicated that H2S demonstrate higher reactivity with surface-adsorbed Ni precursor than H2O. The material properties of ALD NiO and NiS thin films including stoichiometry, crystallinity, band structure, and electronic properties were analyzed by multiple experimental techniques, showing potential of ALD NiS as electrode or catalyst for energy-oriented devices.									12	1	0	0	0	0	12			0272-8842	1873-3956		WOS:000442714100028

Here, we report the facile synthesis of metal-free hybrid catalysts, in which graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) is coupled with nanoporous graphene doped by S and Se. The S and Se co-doped hybrid catalyst (g-C3N4@S-Se-pGr) reveals superior electrocatalytic performances, including an exchange current density of 6.27 x 10(-6) A cm(-2), an on-set potential of 0.092 V, a Tafel slope of 86 mV dec(-1), an adsorption free energy of -0.13 eV, and long-term stability comparable to those of commercial Pt/C catalysts. Volcano plots showing the hydrogen evolution activity versus adsorption free energy are also compatible with those of the conventional metal catalysts. Our strategy has the potential to allow a new paradigm for the development of high-performance metal-free electrocatalysts for energy conversion devices.									90	4	0	0	5	0	94			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000356022800029

The F-O level of fluorescence was considerably enhanced indicating formation of stable-reduced forms of the primary quinone electron acceptor, Q(A). The F-m level of fluorescence declined only a little. The g = 1.9 and g = 1.82 EPR forms characteristic of the bicarbonate-bound and bicarbonate-depleted semiquinone-iron complex, Q(A)(-)Fe(2+), respectively, exhibited differential sensitivity against photoinhibition. The large g = 1.9 signal was rapidly diminished but the small g = 1.82 signal decreased more slowly. The S-2-state multiline signal, the oxygen evolution and photooxidation of the high potential form of cytochrome b-559 were inhibited approximately with the same kinetics as the g 1.9 signal. The low potential form of oxidized cytochrome b-559 and Signal IIslow arising from Tyr(D)(+) decreased considerably slower than the g = 1.9 semiquinone-iron signal. The high potential form. of oxidized cytochrome b-559 was diminished faster than the low potential form. Photoinhibition of the g = 1.9 and g = 1.82 forms of Q(A) was accompanied with the appearance and gradual saturation of the spin-polarized triplet signal of P 680. The amplitude of the radical signal from photoreducible pheophytin remained constant during the 3 hour illumination period. In the thermoluminescence glow curves of particles the Q band (S(2)Q(A)(-) charge recombination) was almost completely abolished. To the contrary, the C band (TyrD(+)Q(A)(-) charge recombination) increased a little upon illumination. The EPR and thermoluminescence observations suggest that the Photosystem II reaction centers can be classified into two groups with different susceptibility against photoinhibition.									4	0	0	0	3	0	4			0166-8595	1573-5079		WOS:A1995TQ94600026	24301585

Our aim is to characterize the conditions for explosive burning to occur, and identify a possible explosion mechanism of Type Ia supernovae. The primary components of our model systems are carbon-oxygen (C/O) white dwarfs, while the secondaries are made either of C/O or of pure helium. We account for tidal effects in the initial conditions in a self-consistent way, and consider initially well-separated systems with slow inspiral rates. We study the merger evolution using an adaptive mesh refinement, reactive, Eulerian code in three dimensions, assuming symmetry across the orbital plane. We use a corotating reference frame to minimize the effects of numerical diffusion, and solve for self-gravity using a multigrid approach. We find a novel detonation mechanism in C/O mergers with massive primaries. Here, the detonation occurs in the primary's core and relies on the combined action of tidal heating, accretion heating, and self-heating due to nuclear burning. The exploding structure is compositionally stratified, with a reverse shock formed at the surface of the dense ejecta. The existence of such a shock has not been reported elsewhere. The explosion energy (1.6 x 10(51) erg) and Ni-56 mass (0.86 M-circle dot) are consistent with an SN Ia at the bright end of the luminosity distribution, with an approximated decline rate of Delta m(15)(B) approximate to 0.99. Our study does not support double-detonation scenarios in the case of a system with a 0.6 M-circle dot helium secondary and a 0.9 M-circle dot primary. Although the accreted helium detonates, it fails to ignite carbon at the base of the boundary layer or in the primary's core.									6	0	1	0	0	0	7			0035-8711	1365-2966		WOS:000384676000015

This work addresses the sluggish water oxidation reaction associated with hematite photoanode by tweaking its internal porosity. The porous hematite photoanodes are fabricated by a novel synthetic strategy via pulse reverse electrodeposition (PRED) method that involves incorporation of a cationic CTAB surfactant in a sulfate electrolyte and spin-coated ZrO2 underlayer (UL) on FTO. CTAB is found to be beneficial in promoting the film growth rate during PRED. Incorporation of Zr4+ ions from ZrO2 UL and Sn4+ ions from FTO into the Fe2O3 lattice via solid-state diffusion reaction during pertinent annihilation of surfactant molecules at 800 degrees C produced internally porous hematite films with improved carrier concentration. The porous hematite demonstrated a sustained photocurrent enhancement and a significant cathodic shift of 130 mV relative to the planar hematite under standard illumination conditions (AM 1.5G) in 1 M NaOH electrolyte. The absorption, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and Mott-Schottky analyses revealed that the ZrO2 UL and CTAB not only increased the carrier density and light harvesting but also accelerated the surface oxidation reaction kinetics, synergistically boosting the performance of internally porous hematite photoanodes.									12	0	0	0	2	0	12			2045-2322			WOS:000382244300002	27577967

Diffusion of hydrazine hydrate downward in agar gel facilitated the reaction between hydrazine and Co2+ leading a dilatational wave of reactant concentration. The resulting periodic Liesegang bands of alpha-Co(OH)(2) were observed due to the diffusion hindrance of reactants. It can be deduced that the high concentration of Co2+ causes formation of alpha-Co(OH)(2) while the low concentrations produce beta-Co(OH)(2 center dot)beta-Co(OH)(2) is oxidized readily to form brown beta-Co(OH)(3) at the upper area of agar gel with high alkali condition and O-2 distribution. This study is helpful to learn the formation of more than one product and prepare multiple materials in single chemical reaction system. In addition, the obtained alpha-Co(OH)(2) has been stabilized in the gel medium for at least 3 months. It may facilitate its application in many areas especially in electrochemical area since alpha-Co(OH)(2) typically exhibits higher conductivity and electrocatalysis than beta-Co(OH)(2) while in the past its application often is limited by thermodynamically instability.

Because the hydrogen production was very trace with pure TiO2, the simultaneous metal deposition was applied into the glucose solution. The photocatalytic H-2 production activity with TiO2 was significantly enhanced by simultaneous metal deposition for Au and Pd. The experimental factors such as glucose concentration, metal ion concentration and reaction temperature were investigated. The photocatalytic hydrogen production increased with increasing the concentration of glucose, and it followed Langmuir-Hinshelwood mechanism. Under the optimal conditions, the photocatalytic hydrogen generations from aqueous glucose solution with in-situ Au and Pd deposited TiO2 were about 203 and 362 times larger compared with those observed with pure TiO2. The enhanced photocatalytic activity could be explained in terms of reduced electron hole recombination via electron transfer from conductance band of TiO2 to metal.

Unlike other polymers, a significant feature of COFs is that they are structurally predesignable, synthetically controllable, and functionally manageable. In principle, the topological design diagram offers geometric guidance for the structural tiling of extended porous polygons, and the polycondensation reactions provide synthetic ways to construct the predesigned primary and high-order structures. Progress over the past decade in the chemistry of these two aspects undoubtedly established the base of the COF field. By virtue of the availability of organic units and the diversity of topologies and linkages, COFs have emerged as a new field of organic materials that offer a powerful molecular platform for complex structural design and tailor-made functional development. Here we target a comprehensive review of the COF field, provide a historic overview of the chemistry of the COF field, survey the advances in the topology design and synthetic reactions, illustrate the structural features and diversities, scrutinize the development and potential of various functions through elucidating structure-function correlations based on interactions with photons, electrons, holes, spins, ions, and molecules, discuss the key fundamental and challenging issues that need to be addressed, and predict the future directions from chemistry, physics, and materials perspectives.									876	53	0	0	88	1	882			0009-2665	1520-6890		WOS:000566663800016	31967791

In the first instance, the impact of the electrolyte composition on the kinetics of the electrode reactions was studied. Subsequently the ionic conductivity of the membrane, in the form of individual anions, and the efficiency of the alkaline water electrolysis process were evaluated by means of electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and a laboratory single-cell alkaline water electrolyzer. The anion used was observed to make a significant impact both on the ionic conductivity as well as on the kinetics of the anode reaction, resulting in reduced electrolysis efficiency. A stability test revealed kinetics of chemical degradation of the polymer anion-selective membrane in a Na2CO3 solution similar to those in a KOH environment at 70 degrees C. An alternative approach of decreasing the temperature to 50 degrees C prolonged the chemical stability and made less impact on the process efficiency.

The experiments showed that at pH 11, N, N'-bis(salicylidene) ethylenediamino cobalt(II) and cobalt(II) perchlorate were active for water oxidation. On the other hand, for cobalt(II) phthalocyanine as a stable complex, no water oxidation was observed. The role of nanosized particles containing Co, P, and O in the electrochemical oxidation of water by cobalt complexes was investigated by some methods. After the water oxidation reaction, both complexes and the cobalt salt were studied and a relationship between the decomposition of the cobalt complex and water oxidation was proposed. A critical point is that on the surface of the electrode, there are some areas without any detectable nanoparticles, and thus, the detection of such cobalt compounds on the surface of the electrode is not easy even by high-resolution visible spectroelectrochemistry and scanning electron microscopy. Such experiments showed that to propose a molecular mechanism for water oxidation in the presence of metal complexes, careful analysis is necessary to rule out the role of nanoparticles.									39	0	0	0	3	0	39			2044-4753	2044-4761		WOS:000432082800007

The powder material was produced through inert gas atomization and then cryomilled in liquid nitrogen. The milled powder particles were consolidated by hot isostatic pressing ("hipping") followed by thermomechanical treatment, resulting in a two-phase microstructure. The microstructures were characterized using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The principal processing factors and microstructural characteristics associated with the major processing steps, including spray atomization, mechanical milling (MM), consolidation, and heat treatment, were evaluated and discussed. Hot isostatic pressing and extrusion followed by heat treatment to produce the superplastic structure (Al-rich phase and Zn-rich phase) are effective in elimination porosity. A TEM examination of the microstructure of the alloy after processing reveals the presence of nanodispersion particles that are not uniformly distributed. The formation of the dispersions was attributed to the interaction between the powder material (primarily Al phase) and environmental elements such as oxygen and nitrogen during milling. Moreover, the size and distribution of the dispersions present in the bulk material met the anticipated requirements for serving as inhibitors for grain growth and barriers for dislocation movement. The TEM observations on crept specimens reveal extensive dislocation/dispersion interactions.									10	0	0	0	0	0	10			1073-5623	1543-1940		WOS:000232076800026

However, the synthesis of non-preciousearly transition metal intermetallic nanoparticles remains a formidable challenge owing to the extremely oxyphilic nature and very negative reduction potentials. Here, we have successfully synthesized non-precious Co3Ta intermetallic nanoparticles, with uniform size of 5 nm. Atomic structural characterizations and X-ray absorption fine structure measurements confirm the atomically ordered intermetallic structure. As electrocatalysts for the hydrazine oxidation reaction, Co3Ta nanoparticles exhibit an onset potential of -0.086 V (vs. reversible hydrogen electrode) and two times higher specific activity relative to commercial Pt/C (+0.06 V), demonstrating the top-level performance among reported electrocatalysts. The Co-Ta bridge sites are identified as the location of the most active sites thanks to density functional theory calculations. The activation energy of the hydrogen dissociation step decreases significantly upon N2H4 adsorption on the Co-Ta bridge active sites, contributing to the significantly enhanced activity.									48	2	0	0	2	0	48			2041-1723			WOS:000489013700007	31586070

In this study, the Cl- concentration was investigated as the first key variable factor. A magnetically assembled electrode (MAE) architecture with flexibility and variability was utilized to treat such variable organic wastewater. The main electrode of MAE, i.e., Ti/Pb3O4 anode offered the MAE with the high chlorine evolution ability and stability at high NaCl concentration, while the auxiliary electrodes of MAE, i.e., Sb-SnO2 coated magnetic particles (Fe3O4/Sb-SnO2), provided the MAE with sufficient EO ability at low NaCl concentration. The degradation experiments on azo dye and phenol using MAE with different loading amount of Fe3O4/Sb-SnO2 were carried out. The results provided a design rule in adjusting the optimized modular components for achieving higher EO efficiency under different Cl(- )concentrations. The relationships between MAE's surface composition/structure, electrochemical properties, degradation efficiency and Cl(- )concentration were further revealed. Finally, the operating mechanism of the MAE was discussed and verified.									8	1	0	0	4	0	8			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000525637300063

Nevertheless, developing a highly efficient and robust photocatalytic system remains a huge challenge. Herein, we constructed a photocatalytic system integrated 2D semiconductor with the noble-metal-free conductor to improve the photocatalytic performance. To implement this idea, optimizing bulk semiconductor to 2D ultra-thin structure shortens the migration distance of photogenerated carriers. Then, constructing a noble-metal-free conductor-semiconductor Schottky junction further improves the separation of photogenerated electron-hole (e(-)-h(+)) pairs. Combining the advantages of 2D ultrathin structure and Schottky junction effect, the photocatalytic performance of the system is synergistically enhanced. In this work, we choose metallic nickel phosphide (Ni2P) as a conductor integrated with 2D g-C3N4 as a proof of concept. As expected, the composites exhibit a significant improvement in photocatalytic performance in comparison with the bare 2D g-C3N4. The process of photogenerated carriers is illustrated by various characterizations and the corresponding mechanism is also proposed.									22	2	0	0	2	0	23			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000486177700070

Here we have investigated the In3+-for-Cu+ cation exchange in the dodecahedral-shaped Cu7S4 NCs and found that surface passivation, either caused by excess guest cations or ligand molecules, can be exploited to engineer the structural properties of the NCs. By monitoring the parallel reactions carried out under systematically varied conditions, together with the positron annihilation spectroscopy investigation, we have demonstrated that the key element accounting for the observed surface passivation is associated with the copper vacant sites on the surface of Cu7S4 NCs. The reduction in In3+/Cu+ ratio and the presence of strong-binding ligands could enhance the density of surface copper vacancies and boost cation exchange reaction, which therefore alters the competition between the in-diffusion of In3+ and out-diffusion of Cu+ ions. Such capability to control the inter-diffusion balance in cation exchange (and the accompanying Kirkendall effect) enables the creation of a series of CuInS2 (and Cu7S4@CuInS2) NCs with various exotic structures, which show different photocatalytic abilities in singlet oxygen generation. This study can not only add more structural complexity and diversity to the semiconductor NCs achievable by cation exchange, but also presents an important guideline for establishing a unifying mechanistic understanding of the reaction kinetics in cation exchange process.									8	1	0	0	2	0	8			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000536690000046

In this work, we reported a series of Fe-containing LDHs-supported Pt-based catalysts for base-free selective hydrogenation of cinnamaldehyde into cinnamyl alcohol. It was revealed that their catalytic performances were closely correlated to the compositions of LDH supports. Especially, highly selective hydrogenation of cinnainaldehyde could be achieved over the Fe(II)-Fe(III)-LDH (green rust, FeFe-LDH) supported Pt catalyst, with a high cinnamyl alcohol selectivity of about 921 at a conversion of 90% after a reaction of 2 h, superior to other Fe(III)-containing LDHs (e.g., NiFe-LDH, CoFe-LDH, and ZnFe-LDH) supported Pt ones. It was demonstrated that the high catalytic efficiency of Pt/FeFe-LDH mainly originated from highly electron-rich character of metallic Pt species and the presence of surface reductive Fe2+ species, thereby being helpful for the chemisorption and activation of carbonyl group in cinnamaldehyde. Moreover, strong interactions between green rust matrix and metallic Pt species could stabilize the surface Pt nanoparticles, thereby inhibiting the metal leaching during the above reaction. The present study illustrates the validity of support control in supported Pt catalysts via tuning the compositions of LDHs, and thus the electronic structure of active metal sites and catalytic performance in the selective hydrogenation of cinnamaldehyde.									18	0	0	0	1	0	18			2470-1343			WOS:000449026500052	31458003

The growth mechanism of the resulting NNWs was investigated detailedly by monitoring the morphology evolution at different growth stages. The formation of rough and striped grains in the initial stage was the determinant factor, which facilitated and guided the subsequent growth of NNWs. In our case, the obtained ZnO NNWs were of single-crystal wurtzite structure with a small full width at half-maximum (481 arcsec) of (0002) omega-rocking curve. We also demonstrated the feasibility of controlling the morphology, structural and optical features of ZnO NNWs by adjusting the oxygen flow rate. A controllable evolution of micro-hole size and density of ZnO NNWs was observed. In addition, possible microcavity-related light oscillation and contaminants adsorption behaviors were proposed to explain the shift of ultraviolet peak and deep-level emission variation for the produced ZnO NNWs. Temperature-dependent photoluminescence results behaving with strong exciton effects further confirmed the relatively excellent quality of the obtained ZnO NNWs. It was reasonably believed that the novel 2D nanostructures featuring high crystallinity and remarkable optical properties can be employed in reliable optoelectronic nanodevices.

However, the primitive MOF can not show greater potential and application value. Here Co-ZIF-67 dodecahedron was controllably carved via the different ways for efficiently boosting the photo-catalytic property of hydrogen evolution. This reasonable design can not only preserve polyhedron characteristics with the large specific surface area of ZIF-67, but also improve H-2-evolution performance in Eosin Y sensitization system, which depends on the enhanced electro-negativity of the surface of ZIF-6 derived polyhedrons and the quite strong adsorption of H and H2O by Co-site. Meanwhile, ligand group or hetero-atom adjacent to metal Co atom owing to the introduction of electronegative heteroatoms overturns the inherent structure and properties of ZIF-67 to a certain extent thereby rearranging the electron distribution and improving transfer efficiency of charge carriers. Additionally, the structural evolution of ZIF-67 constructs an efficient transport channels for migration of electron, which eliminates the resistance to be overcome when electrons migrate from the inside of a semiconductor to the surface. And the increase of optical absorption density caused by hyperchromicity effect is also a factor that can not be ignored for evolving the co-catalytic performance of ZIF-67.									79	1	0	0	7	0	79			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000503381200196

The room temperature X-ray diffractograms revealed the irreversible phase evolution from amorphous to pseudohexagonal (823 K) to orthorhombic (1023 K) and to monoclinic crystal structure (1223 K). While phase evolution was also confirmed by thermogravimetry and dilatometry, Raman spectroscopy clearly suggested complete elimination of free carbon in the pyrolysed ceramics. The sintering conditions were optimized to produce a highly dense ( > 95%) thermodynamically stable monoclinic Nb2O5. The electrical properties of stable monoclinic Nb2O5 sample were thoroughly studied. The monoclinic Nb2O5 was found to have a dielectric constant of around 28 with a dielectric loss of 0.008 at room temperature and at 100 kHz. M low measurement frequencies, an anomalous increase in the effective dielectric permittivity with increasing temperature was observed. Large values of the epsilon' are associated with polarization due to the accumulation of free electrons at the grain boundaries. An analysis of the dispersion curves of Nb2O5 revealed that two relaxation processes are responsible for the observed anomalies, and the temperature dependencies of their parameters (dielectric strength, relaxation time and spectrum broadening parameter) were determined. The lowfrequency process (relaxation time tau(0) similar to 0.45 s), which makes the largest contribution to the dielectric constant, was apparently due to the inhomogeneous conductivity of ceramics. It was revealed that the DC conductivity of ceramics has thermoactivation character with activation energy of about 660 meV and was determined by the oxygen vacancies.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			0272-8842	1873-3956		WOS:000528340500120

Although nonprecious nickel-based catalysts work well at low current densities, they need large overpotentials at high current densities, which hinders their wide applications in practical industry. Here we report a hydroxide-mediated nickel-based electrocatalyst for high-current-density hydrogen evolution, which delivers a current density of 1000 mA cm(-2) at an ultralow overpotential of 97 mV. Combined X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) results show charge redistribution of Ni sites caused by Mo and surface Fe, which can stabilize the surface nickel hydroxide at high current densities for promoting the water dissociation step. Combined in situ XAS, quasi in situ XPS, and density functional theory calculations indicate that Fe plays an important role in the improved catalytic activity. Such a catalyst is synthesized at the metre-size scale and delivers a current density of 500 mA cm(-2) at 1.56 V in overall water splitting, demonstrating its potential for practical use. This work highlights a charge engineering strategy to design efficient catalysts for high current density electrochemical applications.									33	0	0	0	3	0	33			1754-5692	1754-5706		WOS:000678047600001

The structural and morphological changes of the add-treated biochar were investigated using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Raman spectroscopy, organic elemental analysis and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS). Improved surface functionality of the treated biochars was observed in their respective FT-lR spectra through the presence of nitro and carboxylic acid functional groups. SEM-EDS and elemental analysis revealed a large increase in the oxygen to carbon ratio in the biochar, which was evidence of chemical oxidation from the acid treatment. Further, TGA study showed the reduced thermal stability of acid-treated biochar over 200 degrees C due to the increased oxygen content. Acid treatments also influenced the graphitic structure of the biochar, as observed in the Raman spectra. The results suggest that biochar can be successfully functionalized for composite applications and provide a sustainable alternative to petroleum-based carbon additives. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

The anion photoelectron spectra of [Pt(H2O)](-), formed under different conditions, exhibit spectral features that are due to the anion-molecule complex, Pt-(H2O), and to the reaction intermediates, HPtOH- and H2PtO-, in which one and two O-H bonds have been broken, respectively. Additionally, the observations of PtO- and H-2(+) in mass spectra strongly imply that water splitting via the reaction Pt- + H2O -> PtO- + H-2 has occurred. Extending these studies to nickel and palladium shows that they too are able to activate single water molecules, as evidenced by the formation of the reaction intermediates, HNiOH- and HPdOH-. Computations at the coupled cluster singles and doubles with perturbatively connected triples level of theory provide structures and vertical detachment energies (VDEs) for both HMOH- and H2MO- intermediates. The calculated and measured VDE values are in good agreement and thus support their identification.

B	Opasanont, B.								Dynamics of Chemical Bath Deposition of Inorganic Thin Films for Photovoltaic Applications								Dynamics of Chemical Bath Deposition of Inorganic Thin Films for Photovoltaic Applications								140 pp	140 pp						2015	2015	Chemical bath deposition (CBD) is a simple, low cost and scalable technique to deposit inorganic films, but lack of fundamental understanding and control of the underlying chemistry has limited its versatility. We combined the use of a continuous-flow microreactor (CFmicroR), speciation modeling, and novel time-resolved bath characterization techniques to better understand the evolution of the baths and its impact on film formation and properties. The model system for this study was ZnS, a wide band gap semiconductor whose many applications, such as photovoltaic buffer layers, require uniform and continuous films down to several nanometers thick. In CBD of ZnS, oxygen is often incorporated into the film as oxide and hydroxide to form Zn(S,O,OH). Oxide tunes electronic band levels while hydroxide detrimentally affects electronic device stability. Efforts to understand the film formation and gradation of the film stoichiometry and properties are limited by film thicknesses of ~50 nm that are smaller than the probe size of many characterization techniques. We used a CFmicroR to investigate relationships between bath composition and film properties deposited from a high-performance alkaline recipe. For decreased film oxygen content, the near-neutral deposition regime was explored. Hexamethylenetetramine (HMTA) was successfully used as an additive to maintain near-neutral pH for rapid deposition of continuous film with reduced oxygen impurities. Complexing agents, or ligands, limit the free metal ion concentration and control the film deposition rate, but their dynamic properties are poorly understood. We demonstrated that dynamic speciation modeling is a powerful tool in predicting the ligands' throttling behavior. Time-dependent deposition rate was captured through spatially-dependent film thickness by CFmicroR, and confirmed the prediction of the model. Understanding bath dynamics is crucial to advancing CBD from the traditional "recipe-based" perception to a level in which film properties can be fully controlled by bath engineering.									0	0	0		0	0	0					978-13-218-9809-5	INSPEC:15937950

However, recent experimental and theoretical evidence has cast doubt on the efficiency of such processes. Grain-surface chemistry is frequently invoked as a solution, but until now there have been no quantitative models taking into account both the high degree of chemical complexity and the evolving physical conditions of starforming regions. Here, we introduce a new gas-grain chemical network, wherein a wide array of complex species may be formed by reactions involving radicals. The radicals we consider ( H, OH, CO, HCO, CH3, CH3O, CH2OH, NH, and NH2) are produced primarily by cosmic ray-induced photodissociation of the granular ices formed during the colder, earlier stages of evolution. The gradual warm up of the hot core is crucial to the formation of complex molecules, allowing the more strongly bound radicals to become mobile on grain surfaces. This type of chemistry is capable of reproducing the high degree of complexity seen in Sgr B2(N), and can explain the observed abundances and temperatures of a variety of previously detected complex organic molecules, including structural isomers. Many other complex species are predicted by this model, and several of these species may be detectable in hot cores. Differences in the chemistry of high-and low-mass star formation are also addressed; greater chemical complexity is expected where evolution timescales are longer.									635	5	0	0	13	0	635			0004-637X	1538-4357		WOS:000257834000023

It is also an important environmental factor that leads to oxidative damage. Hypoxia is a condition in which tissues are deprived of oxygen; reoxygenation is the phenomenon in which hypoxic tissues are exposed to oxygen. Hypoxia-reoxygenation is vital in pathogenesis, where the production of reactive oxygen species and antioxidant disparity significantly contribute to disease progression, and it is one of the most common physiological stressors in the aquaculture industry.Methods and results In this study, the full length of complementary DNA (cDNA) of the manganese superoxide dismutase (Mn-SOD) gene of healthy cobia Rachycentron canadum was analysed using rapid amplification of cDNA ends. The real-time quantitative Polymerase Chain Reaction was used to measure the expression levels of Mn-SOD mRNAs in various tissues (heart, muscle, brain, liver, kidney, gill, intestine, and spleen). The 2(-Delta Delta CT) method was used to performed the expression analysis. The experimental data were analysed using SPSS ver. 19.0 (). P < 0.05 and P < 0.01 were set as significant differences. The values were articulated as mean +/- standard deviation. The Mn-SOD gene cDNA sequence was 1209 bp long, including a 684 bp open reading frame, 42 bp 5'UTR and 483 bp 3'UTR, encoding 227 amino acids. Under hypoxia-reoxygen stress, the expression of Mn-SOD in brain tissue was significantly lower than in the control group after 8 h of reoxygenation and higher than the control group after 24 h.

It is revealed that the (111) and (200) facets are the possible exposed surfaces of the cubic structure, while the possible exposed surfaces of the tetragonal structure are (101), (101), (110), (002) and (002) facets. The computed surface energies reveal that the P-terminated (111) surface and the (200) surface of the cubic SnP system as well as the P-terminated (101) and (101) surfaces and the (110) surface of the tetragonal SnP system can be considered as the more stable surfaces, in view of more favorable surface energy. The computed free energy values of H* (G(H*)) show that all these stable surfaces can possess considerably high HER catalytic activity over a wide range of hydrogen coverage. It is found that the top sites over P atoms can serve as the most active sites on these surfaces, and the tetragonal structure can even exhibit a higher HER activity than the cubic structure. Moreover, the correlative catalytic mechanisms have been analyzed in detail. Coupled with the metallic conductivity, two kinds of bulk SnP systems can be very promising candidates as a high-performance and low-cost HER electrocatalyst. All these fascinating findings can be beneficial for promoting the application of excellent SnP-based materials in catalyzing the water splitting process.									7	0	0	0	0	0	7			1463-9076	1463-9084		WOS:000461722800017	30785157

Cyclic voltammetry studies of the cationic porphyrin [Ttolyl(P-(C6H5)(3))(4)](4+) demonstrated its ability to absorb both glassy carbon and ITO electrodes. The electrochemical properties of the hybrid porphyrin/quantum dot films (i.e., ITO/{[Ttolyl(P-(C6H5)(3))(4)](4+)/CdTe}(n), where n = 1-5 is the immersion step) were explored in buffer solutions in the presence or absence of the Fe(CN) (6) (3-) /Fe(CN) (6) (4-) redox couple at pH 7.0. The resistance to electron transfer determined by cyclic voltammetry and EIS is in agreement with the increase in the UV-Vis absorption of the material adsorbed onto the ITO surface for each newly assembled bilayer. The prepared bilayers exhibited an interesting homogeneous morphological distribution of CdTe quantum dots on the surface, which indicated the ability of [Ttolyl(P-(C6H5)(3))(4)](4+) to organize CdTe nanoparticles on the ITO surface. EDX analysis of the bilayers confirmed the presence of Cd, Te, and S from the quantum dot. Linear sweep voltammetry indicated that ITO/{[Ttolyl(P-(C6H5)(3))(4)](4+)/CdTe}(5) has oxygen reduction electrocatalytic properties and demonstrated a synergetic effect between the cationic porphyrin and the CdTe quantum dot.					21st meeting of the Iberoamerican-Electrochemical-Society21st meeting of the Iberoamerican-Electrochemical-Society	APR 06-11, 2014APR 06-11, 2014		La Serena, CHILELa Serena, CHILE	7	0	0	0	0	0	7			0021-891X	1572-8838		WOS:000344778900012

As comparison, P25 with mainly exposed (101) facets were employed to combine with CdS nanorods. The 2D/1D heterojunction of TiO2 nanosheets and CdS nanorod displayed 3.7 times higher hydrogen generation than that of P25/CdS composites. The results indicated that TiO2 with exposed (001) facets were favorable for enhancing the photocatalytic activity of CdS via optimizing the heterojunction between TiO2 and CdS. Photoluminescence and photoelectrochemical characteristics results demonstrated that the 2D-TiO2/1D-CdS heterojunction exhibits higher separation efficiency of photoinduced carriers and superior electron transfer ability. This work exemplifies that heterojunction modification is an effective strategy to improve the efficiency of the photocatalyst composites. (C) 2018 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC.

Ionic liquid-assisted synthesis of tri-functional ruthenium oxide nanoplatelets for electrochemical energy applications								JOURNAL OF MATERIALS SCIENCE				57	15			7680	7693		10.1007/s10853-022-07120-z		APR 2022		APR 2022	2022	Nanostructured crystalline metal oxides are in great demand in industrial processes due to their unique physicochemical properties and ionic liquids (ILs) are promising solvent for synthesizing such materials. Herein, we report an IL-assisted, facile, and environmental benign approach to synthesize rutile phase of ruthenium oxide (RuO2) nanoplatelets (NPLs) structure with a size distribution of a few tens of nm. The key to this synthesis methodology is the use of imidazolium-based ILs as solvents and binder in the ionothermal process. The obtained RuO2 phase is thoroughly characterized by spectroscopic and microscopic techniques. Further, the material is used as electrocatalyst toward electrochemical energy storage and conversion in an alkaline solution. The platelet morphology of RuO2 exhibits excellent supercapacitor performance and its capacitance value is similar to 200 F g(-1) in 1 M KOH solution. Besides, the as-synthesized RuO2 NPLs shows superior water oxidation and chlorine evolution processes at a minimal overpotential, i.e., 1.47 V in 1 M KOH and 1.5 V in 3 M KCl (pH 3) electrolyte, respectively, exhibiting its tri-functional electrochemical behavior toward production of renewable energies. The present study demonstrates that single-step production of the NPL morphology of RuO2 has potential implications in the field of electrolysis and supercapacitors.[GRAPHICS].									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0022-2461	1573-4803		WOS:000781282500002

In this study, we report the synthesis of molybdenum phosphide nanowires on carbon cloth (MoP NW/CC) by a facile iron-assisted strategy; the as-obtained MoP NW/CC is a robust hydrogen evolution catalyst with high activity. Results reveal that the added iron can promote the upward growth of ferrum molybdenum oxide (Fe-Mo-O) nanowire precursor on carbon cloth and morphological maintenance during the in situ gas-solid phosphidation process; thus, iron plays a key role in engineering the morphology of the catalysts. As a novel 3D hydrogen evolution cathode, the as-obtained MoP NW/CC electrode exhibits a low onset potential of 72 mV, low overpotential of 173 mV for high current density of 100 mA cm(- 2), a small Tafel slope of 53.3 mV dec(-1,) and superior durability in an acidic electrolyte. Additionally, this electrode displays considerable HER activity and promising stability in alkaline and neutral media. This outstanding HER activity for MoP NW/CC can be ascribed to its unique nanowire morphology with a large surface area exposing ample active sites and superior charge transport kinetics. Importantly, in our study, a facile and effective approach has been developed for regulating the morphology of transition-metal phosphides.									28	1	0	0	0	0	28			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000414605900041

Powders were deposited as thick films on alumina substrates with comb-type Au electrodes and then sintered in nitrogen or air atmosphere. The surface chemical analysis was performed using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The Ols XPS line was separated in two peaks attributed to adsorbed oxygen (O-ad) and oxygen in the lattice (O-lattice) on the surface. The ratio [O-ad + O-lattice]/[La + Fe] was uninfluenced by the ambient during sintering. The [O-lattice]/[La + Fe] atomic ratio decreased and [O-ad]/ [La + Fe] value increased upon sintering in N-2 atmosphere, as compared with samples sintered in air. It was argued that O-ad sites act as adsorption sites for nitrogen dioxide. The increase in O-ad sites is effective for enhancing electrical conductivity in nitrogen dioxide.									9	0	0	0	0	0	9			1882-0743	1348-6535		WOS:000090007100007

Platinum was electro-deposited on Ti by potentiostatic and galvanostatic techniques. Electrodes prepared by the galvanostatic technique showed enhanced catalytic activity towards methanol oxidation in NaOH solution compared to those prepared by the potentiostatic method. Scanning electron microscopy and energy dispersive X-ray analysis were used to characterize the surface morphology and percent composition of Pt to Ti on the electrode surface. The catalytic activity of Pt/Ti electrode is much higher than that of Pt/Pt, bulk Ti and of pure Pt, in addition to minimizing the poisoning effect. In 3.0 M NaOH and in the presence of 2.0 M MeOH, the oxidation peak current density value of methanol after the 50th cycles reached 99.4% of its value at the first cycle for electrodes prepared by the galvanostatic method compared to 94.7% for electrodes prepared by the potentiostatic method. Polarizing the modified electrode at the hydrogen evolution potential region for a certain time was found to enhance the catalytic oxidation of methanol, while the presence of thick Ti-oxide as well as Ti-hydride inhibited the process.

The microstructure, morphology, composition and optical properties had been thoroughly investigated. The results showed that the as-obtained ZnxCd1-xS samples exhibited monodisperse spherical feature. These monodisperse ZnxCd1-xS spheres were composed of a large number of 5-10 nm crystal grains. The chemical composition of the ZnxCd1-xS solid solutions can be controlled by adjusting the ratio of Zn source to Cd source and the dosage of ammonia solution. Meanwhile, the energy band structure and photocatalytic properties can be optimized. The photocatalysis experiment results revealed that the as-synthesized Zn0.30Cd0.70S sample exhibited optimum water splitting performance. The satisfactory hydrogen evolution rate (HER) of Zn0.30Cd0.70S reached 27.004 mmol g(-1) h(-1) even without any cocatalysts, which was more than 48 times that of pure CdS (0.561 mmol g(-1) h(-1)). This enhancing effect can owe to the balance between light absorption capacity and redox potential caused by the incorporation of Zn in the ZnxCd1-xS solid solutions.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			0022-2461	1573-4803		WOS:000604084600001

Conjugated microporous polymers, as a new type of organic semiconductor photocatalyst, have adjustable bandgaps and high specific surface areas, and can be synthesized using diverse methods. In this work, we report the design and synthesis of a series of pyridyl conjugated microporous polymers (PCMPs) utilizing polycondensation of aromatic aldehydes and aromatic ketones in the presence of ammonium acetate. PCMPs with different chemical structures were synthesized via adjusting monomers with different geometries and contents of nitrogen element, which could adjust the bandgap and photocatalytic performance. Photocatalytic hydrogen evolution rate (HER) up to 1198.9 mu mol center dot h(-1)center dot g(-1) was achieved on the optimized polymer with a specific surface area of 312 m(2)center dot g(-1) under UV-Vis light irradiation (lambda>320 nm). This metal-free synthetic method provides a new avenue to preparing an efficient photocatalyst for hydrogen evolution.									8	0	0	0	0	0	8			0256-7679	1439-6203		WOS:000655887600003

A number of terrestrial neutrino detectors are based on inelastic neutrino-nucleus scattering and modeling of the respective cross sections allow predictions of the expected detector reaction rates.Purpose: To provide a self-consistent microscopic description of neutrino-nucleus cross sections involving a large pool of Z = 8-82 nuclei for the implementation in models of nucleosynthesis and neutrino detector simulations.Methods: Self-consistent theory framework based on relativistic nuclear energy density functional is employed to determine the nuclear structure of the initial state and relevant transitions to excited states induced by neutrinos. The weak neutrino-nucleus interaction is employed in the current-current form and a complete set of transition operators is taken into account.Results: We perform large-scale calculations of charged-current neutrino-nucleus cross sections, including those averaged over supernova neutrino fluxes, for the set of even-even target nuclei from oxygen toward lead (Z = 8-82), spanning N = 8-182 (OPb pool). The model calculations include allowed and forbidden transitions up to J = 5 multipoles.Conclusions: The present analysis shows that the self-consistent calculations result in considerable differences in comparison to previously reported cross sections, and for a large number of target nuclei the cross sections are enhanced. Revision in modeling r-process nucleosynthesis based on a self-consistent description of neutrino-induced reactions would allow an updated insight into the origin of elements in the Universe and it would provide the estimate of uncertainties in the calculated element abundance patterns.

However, exploring photocatalytic materials with high efficiency for overall water splitting remains a challenge. Herein, crystalline carbon nitride (CCN) was in situ grown on LaOCl to improve the performance for overall water splitting. Owing to the enhanced photogenerated carrier transfer by crystalline carbon nitride, and the promoted spatial separation of carriers via the built-in electric field between CCN and LaOCl, the optimized CCN/LaOCl composite catalyzes the decomposition of H2O into H-2 and O-2, with evolution rates of 60.6 and 28.1 mu mol h(-1), respectively, prominently surpassing those of most of the reported carbon nitride-based photocatalysts. This work is anticipated to provide new perspectives for the rational design and preparation of CCN-based hybrid photocatalysts for solar water splitting.									8	0	0	0	0	0	8			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000769020200001

Herein, we develop a polyimide-based photocatalyst with a significantly enhanced pi stacking structure which is obtained from solvothermal condensation of pyromellitic dianhydride and N,N-diethylmelamine. The ordered pi stacking leads to extended light absorption ranges via effective intermolecular pi-pi interactions, resulting in a high hydrogen evolution rate of 2516 mu mol g(-1) h(-1) with an apparent quantum efficiency of 11% at 420 nm, as well as significantly boosted photocatalytic degradation and H2O2 synthesis activities.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			2044-4753	2044-4761		WOS:000662330700001

The most intriguing question driving the search for habitable planets is whether they host life. But is the age of the planet important for its habitability? If we define habitability as the ability of a planet to beget life, then probably it is not. After all, life on Earth has developed within only similar to 800 Myr after its formation - the carbon isotope change detected in the oldest rocks indicates the existence of already active life at least 3.8 Gyr ago. If, however, we define habitability as our ability to detect life on the surface of exoplanets, then age becomes a crucial parameter. Only after life had evolved sufficiently complex to change its environment on a planetary scale, can we detect it remotely through its imprint on the atmosphere - the so-called biosignatures, out of which the photosynthetic oxygen is the most prominent indicator of developed (complex) life as we know it. Thus, photosynthesis is a powerful biogenic engine that is known to have changed our planet's global atmospheric properties. The importance of planetary age for the detectability of life as we know it follows from the fact that this primary process, photosynthesis, is endothermic with an activation energy higher than temperatures in habitable zones, and is sensitive to the particular thermal conditions of the planet. Therefore, the onset of photosynthesis on planets in habitable zones may take much longer time than the planetary age. The knowledge of the age of a planet is necessary for developing a strategy to search for exoplanets carrying complex (developed) life - many confirmed potentially habitable planets are too young (orbiting Population I stars) and may not have had enough time to develop and/or sustain detectable life. In the last decade, many planets orbiting old (9-13 Gyr) metal-poor Population II stars have been discovered. Such planets had had enough time to develop necessary chains of chemical reactions and may carry detectable life if located in a habitable zone. These old planets should be primary targets in search for the extraterrestrial life.									14	0	0	0	1	0	14			1473-5504	1475-3006		WOS:000371710100001

As the majority of defects in imperfect structured CN, "native" defects are critical but their role in PHE still lacks in-depth understanding. In this work, nitrogen vacancy, hydroxyl or nitrogen vacancy and hydroxyl co-modified CN was prepared by thermodynamic atmosphere control of the polymerization. It was found that the hydrogen production rate of nitrogen vacancy and hydroxyl co-modified CN is about 2253.6 mu mol h(-1)g(-1), about 3.0 times the PHE rate of either nitrogen vacancy or hydroxyl modified CN. Further transient photocurrent, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and transient PL characterization confirmed the enhanced photogenerated electron-hole separation by the synergetic effects of the two defects in co-modified CN. In combination with density functional theory calculations, we revealed that co-modification of nitrogen vacancy and hydroxyl introduced gap states in the vicinity of the VBM and CBM of the host material, respectively, while deep trap states can be formed for CN modified by a single-type defect of nitrogen vacancy or hydroxyl.									9	0	0	0	1	0	9			2050-7526	2050-7534		WOS:000549153600024

Through a global survey of mid-ocean ridge basalt glasses, we show that mantle oxidation state varies systematically as a function of mantle source composition. Negative correlations between Fe3+/Sigma Fe ratios and indices of mantle enrichment-such as Sr-87/Sr-86, Pb-208/Pb-204, Ba/La, and Nb/Zr ratios-reveal that enriched mantle is more reduced than depleted mantle. Because carbon may act to simultaneously reduce iron and generate melts that share geochemical traits with our reduced samples, we propose that carbon creates magmas at ridges that are reduced and enriched.									63	5	0	0	4	0	66			0036-8075	1095-9203		WOS:000320320200040	23641060

The simulation results are utilized to guide the synthesis of a novel porous graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) material in bead form, using millimeter-scale porous SiO2 beads as a template. The obtained g-C3N4 beads possess a unique porous architecture with 3D interconnected and continuous meso/macropore channels at 30-90 nm in size, which is identical to the simulation result. Compared with pristine g-C3N4, the prepared material exhibits significantly enhanced visible light-induced catalytic performances for H-2 evolution (8 times), photoreduction of nitrobenzene (3 times) and degradations of rhodamine B (4 times), methyl orange (2 times) and phenol (3 times). The unique pores and skeleton structures not only promote light penetration inside the material and light absorption at the edge of pore channels, but also improve mass transfer and inhibit the recombination of photogenerated electrons and holes. Moreover, this optical simulation approach could be adopted to guide the synthesis of other porous photocatalysts, and to verify their light absorption and infiltration properties in photocatalysis.									55	3	0	0	7	0	57			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000413189100025

In the composites, nanoclusters of MoSe2 nanosheets are dispersed on plicated NG nanosheets. The electrochemical measurement suggests that the MoSe2/NG composites exhibit enhanced electro-catalytic HER activity as compared to MoSe2 and MoSe2/RGO. Moreover, as the N/C ratio of NG is increased, the activity of MoSe2/NG increases firstly and then decreases. At low N/C ratio, the impact of interfacial energy barrier between MoSe2 and NG is negligible and the electron transfer is substantial, so the activity of the MoSe2/NG composites increases with carrier concentration in NG. However, at high N/C ratio, the energy barrier blocks the electron transfer from NG to MoSe2 remarkably. Consequently, the MoSe2/NG composites with an intermediate N/C ratio have the highest activity. Owing to the synergistic effect of NG and MoSe2, the Tafel slope of the composites is reduced from 114.69 to 78.45 mV dec(-1) by 32% as compared to pure MoSe2. The results provide us valuable information for efficient design of transition metal dichalcogenide catalysts for electro-catalytic hydrogen evolution.									31	0	0	0	1	0	31			0022-2461	1573-4803		WOS:000410473100020

In this study, bimetallic metal-organic framework (CuCo-MOF-74) was synthesized and characterized by XRD, FT-IR, SEM, TEM, BET, and XPS techniques. The structural analysis results revealed that CuCo-MOF-74 was nano-porous materials with coordinatively unsaturated metal sites. With the addition of PMS, Cu1Co1-MOF-74 exhibited high activity for methylene blue (MB) removal (100% degradation) within 30 min under low 50 mg/L catalyst dosage. The effects of catalyst dosage, PMS dosage, MB concentration, initial pH, and common anions were evaluated. Quenching reactions and EPR studies revealed the coexistence of sulfate radical (SO4 center dot-), hydroxyl radical (center dot OH), and singlet oxygen (O-1(2)), which was attributed to the potential in-situ recycling of cobalt and copper species (Co(III)-> Co(II), Cu(II)-> Cu(I))). Fukui index (f(0)) and dual descriptor (Delta f) by Density functional theory (DFT) calculations were applied to predict the most reactive sites of MB. Meanwhile, the possible degradation pathway of MB was proposed with the help of oxidative intermediates identified by UPLC-MS. (C) 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

Absorption by interstellar Pb II is seen with an equivalent width W-lambda = 0.3 +/- 0.2 (2 sigma) m Angstrom, at a radial velocity which agrees satisfactorily with that of the strongest component of the interstellar Na 1 D-1 line seen in high-resolution optical spectra. If a theoretical oscillator strength f = 0.865 is adopted, the resulting logarithmic depletion is D = -0.97 (+0.22, -0.48) with respect to the meteoritic abundance of Pb. This depletion, which is consistent with Cardelli's result toward zeta Oph, is stronger than that expected from the low condensation temperature, T-c = 496 K, of Pb, in light of the general correlation between the depletions and condensation temperatures of 29 other elements. Some previous ideas about the formation and the evolution of interstellar grains are briefly considered.									22	0	0	0	0	0	22			0004-637X			WOS:A1995RP42500010

In this work, 1D or 2D porous Mo2C nanostructures can be synthesized by carburizing cobalt-based zeolitic imidazolate framework (ZIF-67) cladding MoO3 nanowires or nanosheets hybrid structure under high temperature. The obtained 2D porous Mo2C shows a low onset overpotential ( = 25 and 36 mV) and a small Tafel slope (40 and 47 mV dec(-1)) in 0.1 m HClO4 and 0.1 m KOH as well as great stability.

It evolves slowly over time, and brain mechanisms underlying this evolution are not well understood. Our functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) approach evaluated brain activity contributing to and arising from increasing motion sickness. Subjects rated transitions to increasing nausea, produced by visually induced vection within the fMRI environment. We evaluated parametrically increasing brain activity 1) precipitating increasing nausea and 2) following transition to stronger nausea. All subjects demonstrated visual stimulus-associated activation (P < 0.01) in primary and extrastriate visual cortices. In subjects experiencing motion sickness, increasing phasic activity preceding nausea was found in amygdala, putamen, and dorsal pons/locus ceruleus. Increasing sustained response following increased nausea was found in a broader network including insular, anterior cingulate, orbitofrontal, somatosensory and prefrontal cortices. Moreover, sustained anterior insula activation to strong nausea was correlated with midcingulate activation (r = 0.87), suggesting a closer linkage between these specific regions within the brain circuitry subserving nausea perception. Thus, while phasic activation in fear conditioning and noradrenergic brainstem regions precipitates transition to strong nausea, sustained activation following this transition occurs in a broader interoceptive, limbic, somatosensory, and cognitive network, reflecting the multiple dimensions of this aversive commonly occurring symptom.									118	3	0	0	73	1	122			1047-3211	1460-2199		WOS:000316275800006	22473843

Taking metalloporphyrins as a case study, we evaluate here the adsorption energies of those adsorbates on the metal centers Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni and Cu, using H, F, OH, NH2, CH3, and BH2 as ring ligands. We show that covalence systematically breaks scaling relations under vacuum by strengthening certain M-OOH bonds. However, covalence modifies adsorbate solvation in solution depending on the degree of covalence of the metal-adsorbate bonds. The two effects have similar magnitudes and opposite signs, such that scaling relations are restored in solution. Thus, solvation is a crucial ingredient that must be taken into account in studies aimed at breaking scaling relations in solution. Our findings suggest that the choice of metal and ligand determines the catalytic activity within the limits imposed by scaling relations, whereas the choice of an appropriate solvent can drive such activity beyond those limits.									107	1	0	0	1	0	106			2041-6520	2041-6539		WOS:000391454500011	28451156

TSs share a common catalytic domain with other fold type II PALP dependent enzymes. TSs are broadly grouped into two classes based on their sequence, quaternary structure, and enzyme regulation. We report the presence of a novel zinc ribbon domain in the N-terminal region preceding the catalytic core in TS. The zinc ribbon domain is present in TSs belonging to both classes. Our sequence analysis reveals that archaeal TSs possess all zinc chelating residues to bind a metal ion that are lacking in the structurally characterized homologs. Phylogenetic analysis suggests that TSs with an N-terminal zinc ribbon likely represents the ancestral state of the enzyme while TSs without a zinc ribbon must have diverged later in specific lineages. The zinc ribbon and its N- and C-terminal extensions are important for enzyme stability, activity and regulation. It is likely that the zinc ribbon domain is involved in higher order oligomerization or mediating interactions with other biomolecules leading to formation of larger metabolic complexes.									2	0	0	0	2	0	2			1538-4101	1551-4005		WOS:000414094300012	28820334	
J	Angilletta, MJ; Dunham, AE								The temperature-size rule in ectotherms: Simple evolutionary explanations may not be general								AMERICAN NATURALIST				162	3			332	342						SEP 2003	2003	In many organisms, individuals in colder environments grow more slowly but are larger as adults. This widespread pattern is embodied by two well-established rules: Bergmann's rule, which describes the association between temperature and body size in natural environments, and the temperature-size rule, which describes reaction norms relating temperature to body size in laboratory experiments. Theory predicts that organisms should grow to be larger in colder environments when growth efficiency decreases with increasing environmental temperature. Using data from 97 laboratory experiments, including 58 species of ectotherms, we found little evidence that growth efficiency is negatively related to environmental temperature within the thermal range that is relevant to the temperature-size rule. Instead, growth efficiency was either positively related or insensitive to environmental temperature in the majority of cases (73 of 89 cases for gross growth efficiency and 18 of 24 cases for net growth efficiency). Two possibilities merit consideration. First, high temperatures may impose constraints on growth that only arise late during ontogeny; this simple and potentially general explanation is supported by the fact that thermal optima for growth efficiency and growth rate decrease as individuals grow. Alternatively, the general explanation for relationships between temperature and body size may not be simple. If the latter view is correct, the best approach might be to generate and test theories that are tailored specifically to organisms with similar behavior and physiology.									441	7	4	0	433	6	456			0003-0147	1537-5323		WOS:000185132400006	12970841

Nonphotosynthetic mutants of R. centenum were obtained by enrichment for spontaneous mutations, by ethyl methanesulfonate mutagenesis coupled to penicillin selection on solid medium, and by Tn5 transposition mutagenesis with an IncP plasmid vector containing a temperature-sensitive origin of replication. In vivo and in vitro characterization of individual strains demonstrated that 38 strains contained mutations that blocked bacteriochlorophyll a biosynthesis at defined steps of the biosynthetic pathway. Collectively, these mutations were shown to block seven of eight steps of the pathway leading from protoporphyrin IX to bacteriochlorophyll a. Three mutants were isolated in which carotenoid biosynthesis was blocked early in the biosynthetic pathway; the mutants also exhibited pleiotropic effects on stability or assembly of the photosynthetic apparatus. Five mutants failed to assemble a functional reaction center complex, and seven mutants contained defects in electron transport as shown by an alteration in cytochromes. In addition, several regulatory mutants were isolated that acquired enhanced repression of bacteriochlorophyll in response to the presence of molecular oxygen. The phenotypes of these mutants are discussed in relation to those of similar mutants of Rhodobacter and other Rhodospirillum species of purple photosynthetic bacteria.									16	0	0	0	16	0	16			0021-9193			WOS:A1991FV03900029	1648078

For the synthesized thin films, the composition, morphology, crystalline structure, and optical properties are characterized using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), grazing incidence X-ray diffraction spectroscopy (GIXRD), UV-Vis absorption spectroscopy, and photoluminescence spectroscopy (PL). The formation of ZnO bonds and the increment of nitrate and -OH groups with increasing zinc nitrate concentration are revealed by FTIR spectroscopy. The GIXRD results show a slight shift towards the higher 2 theta angle for all ZnO-related diffraction peaks, confirming the presence of micro-strain in all electrodeposited thin films. The estimated strain values increase with increasing precursor concentration, justifying the increment in crystal defects. SEM images exhibit an evolution of surface morphologies from nanosphere-like to nanosheet or nanoleaf-like structures with the zinc nitrate concentration increment. UV-Vis spectra reveal a red shift in band edge absorption from the lowest to highest zinc nitrate concentration sample; however, the edge again exhibits a blue shift for the moderate zinc nitrate concentration thin film. The calculated bandgap values for all samples are lie within the range of 3.07-2.81 eV. The PL spectra declare an enhancement in emission intensity with increasing precursor concentration. This variation in emission intensity is explained by the change in nanostructures that eventually tuned the defect states and subsequently the luminescence. A UV-light-driven photocatalytic degradation of MO dye in water has been studied to assess the photocatalytic activities of ZnO thin films using UV-Vis absorption spectroscopy. The results show the best photocatalytic efficiency (70.43%) for moderate precursor concentration thin film, achieved by an optimum concentration of surface oxygen vacancy states. However, due to a huge surface oxygen vacancy, the highest precursor concentration thin film exhibits the minimum catalytic efficiency (32.36%). It declares that an excessive amount of surface oxygen vacancy can create bulk oxygen vacancies, which eventually ruins the catalytic activity and reduces the photocatalytic performance.					6th International Conference on Nanoscience and Nanotechnology (ICONN)6th International Conference on Nanoscience and Nanotechnology (ICONN)	FEB 01-03, 2021FEB 01-03, 2021		ELECTR NETWORKELECTR NETWORK	1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0957-4522	1573-482X		WOS:000704968900012

This study proposes a diagenetic model for the Deep Lacq reservoir constrained by petrography, geochemistry, fluid inclusions studies and basin modeling analyses. Drill cores penetrating the 3000 m deep Late Jurassic to Early Cretaceous "Deep Lacq" reservoirs, in the Aquitaine basin SW France, were used to investigate how the geodynamic evolution of the basin influenced the diagenesis of petroleum reservoirs. This basin experienced a phase of rifting during the Lower Cretaceous followed by inversion and compression during the Paleogene. Petrographic and geochemical results indicate that early diagenesis involved bacterial activity and early dolomitization. Fluid thermodynamic modeling, coupled with the reconstruction of the basin history provided insight into the timing of diagenetic fluid circulations. Burial diagenesis involved a rift-related dolomitization episode linked mainly to the recrystallization of earlier dolomites and the circulation of deep hot fluids connected to the Triassic evaporites. The dolomitizing fluids circulated at temperatures close to 136-144 degrees C and pressures of 338-386 bars, during the Aptian (120-116 Ma). During the post-rift uplift and its subsequent thermal re-equilibration, multiple fluid pulses precipitated coarse blocky calcites. These Ca-rich fluids circulated between 109 and 97 Ma, at high-pressure conditions at around of 704-766 bars and with temperatures of 146-156 degrees C. The circulation of another fluid pulse that resulted in the precipitation of anhydrite cements is linked to the onset of the Pyrenean orogeny. No evidence that support in-situ TSR reactions were found, which suggests migration of TSR-related H2S from a kitchen in the deeper parts of the basin. This multi-modeling approach shows how the detailed thermodynamic analyses of fluid inclusions can add valuable constraints on a diagenetic model and eventually link it to the larger-scale basin's history.									3	0	0	0	1	0	3			0264-8172	1873-4073		WOS:000709300200002

Oil shale pyrolysis simulation tests are performed under the in situ bottom hole seepage pressure with a heating and insulation technique, and geochemical tests of the oil shale semi-coke and shale oil and gas products are conducted. The results show that the pyrolysis products form in three stages. At 300 ?C, water is mainly produced. From 300?475 ?C, shale oil and gas are the main products discharged from the oil shale, and the production greatly increases. From 475?520 ?C, oil and water production only slightly increases. Methane is the main hydrocarbon gas produced, and the methane percentage in the samples above 450 ?C is higher than 90 %. Part of the shale oil produced by oil shale pyrolysis remains in the oil shale pores, while some is discharged from the oil shale pores and fractures. The proportions of the non-hydrocarbon components (nitrogen, sulphur and oxygen (NSO)) and asphaltenes in the shale oil remaining in oil shale exceed those of the saturated and aromatic hydrocarbons and reach a peak at 350 ?C. In the later stage of the kerogen transformation process, shale oil is rapidly generated and discharged, and the saturated hydrocarbon content in the discharged shale oil is the highest. Non-hydrocarbon components and asphaltenes may be intermediate products in the transformation process of kerogen into shale oil and may block oil shale pores at approximately 350 ?C. However, with increasing heating temperature during pyrolysis, pores reopen and expand, generating small-molecule hydrocarbons. Oil shale sample pyrolysis at low temperatures attains a good hydrocarbon generation potential, and 425?450 ?C represents a turning point. Oil shale pyrolysis at temperatures above 450 ?C exhibits a low hydrocarbon generation potential. This temperature threshold is very important for downhole temperature selection and control in oil shale mining engineering.									14	0	0	0	0	0	14			0165-2370	1873-250X		WOS:000640934700008

While at pH 5.5, no differences were observed in the isotopic O2-gas exchange of high- and low-C(i) cells, at pH 8.0 the rates of true O2 evolution and uptake were considerably higher in low-C(i) than in high-C(i) cells. The enhanced rates of O2 uptake and evolution by low-C(i) cells were completely inducible within 6 h after transferring high-C(i) cells to ambient air. At pH 8.0, O2 uptake in the light was inhibited by 2 muM 3-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-1,1 dimethylurea in both types of alga, but this effect was more pronounced in low-C(i) than in high-C(i) cells.When the cells were grown at pH 5.5 the activities of the superoxide-radical-degrading enzymes, superoxide dismutase, ascorbate peroxidase, monodehydroascorbate reductase, dehydroascorbate reductase and glutathione reductase, were similar regardless of the CO2 concentration provided during growth. At pH 8.0, however, the activities of these enzymes were 4 to 20 times higher in low-C(i) than in high-C(i) cells. When high-C(i) cells were allowed to acclimate to ambient air for 6 h at pH 8.0, the activities of superoxide dismutase, ascorbate peroxidase and monodehydroascorbate dehydrogenase increased to more than 50% of the level observed with low-C(i) cells. These results are consistent with an enhanced operation of O2 photoreduction which could provide energy to the inorganic-carbon-concentrating mechanism via pseudocyclic photophosphorylation.									42	0	0	0	38	0	42			0032-0935			WOS:A1993KK12100010

All these genital changes taken together are of major importance in facilitating the possibility of reproductive success (and thus gene propagation) no matter how or when the clitoris is stimulated-they reveal its overlooked reproductive function. Of course, also commensurate with these changes, is its activation of sexual pleasure. The clitoris thus has both procreative (reproductive) and recreative (pleasure) functions of equal importance. Clitoridectomy creates not only sexual disability but also a reproductive disability. Clin. Anat., 2019.

J	Wang Xiaohua; Li Ying								Experimental Investigation on the Evolution of Hydrogen in Steel during the Electroslag Remelting Process								MATERIALS RESEARCH-IBERO-AMERICAN JOURNAL OF MATERIALS				22						e20180745	10.1590/1980-5373-MR-2018-0745			2	2019	2019	Hydrogen, which is a harmful element, has a great effect on the mechanical properties of steel, should be removed during the steel manufacture process. The evolution of hydrogen content in steel during electroslag remelting process is experimentally investigated. The results show that during the electroslag remelting process, the hydrogen content in steel firstly increases steeply to maximum, then decreases to minimum and reaches the equilibrium. For a prefixed slag composition, the final hydrogen content in steel depends on the initial hydrogen content and the atmospheric moisture. When the electroslag remelting is operated under the argon protected atmosphere, the hydrogen in steel increased slightly. With the increase of the atmospheric moisture, the hydrogen content in steel increased significantly, and the larger atmospheric moisture is, the more significant influence on the hydrogen content in steel is. Moreover the mathematical formula to predict the hydrogen content in steel from the initial hydrogen content and the atmospheric moisture is derived: w[%H](e) = 0.359w [%H](s) + 0.016 root p(H2O)/p(Theta) + 0.525. It could be used to forecast the final hydrogen content in ESR ingot.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1516-1439	1980-5373		WOS:000476832400001

Remarkable recent advances in the structural analysis of PSII now give a detailed picture of the static supercomplex on the molecular level. These data provide a solid foundation for future functional studies, in particular the mechanism of water oxidation and oxygen release.The catalytic core of the PSII is a tetramanganese-calcium duster (Mn4O5Ca), commonly referred to as the oxygen-evolving complex (OEC). The function of the OEC rests on its ability to cycle through five metastable states (SI, I = 0-4), transiently storing four oxidizing equivalents, and in so doing, facilitates the four electron water splitting reaction. While the latest crystallographic model of PSII gives an atomic picture of the OEC., the exact connectivity within the inorganic core and the S-state(s) that the X-ray model represents remain uncertain.In this Account, we describe our joint experimental and theoretical efforts to eliminate these ambiguities by combining the X-ray data with spectroscopic constraints and introducing computational modeling. We are developing quantum chemical methods to predict electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) parameters for transition metal dusters, especially focusing on spin-projection approaches combined with density functional theory (DFT) calculations. We aim to resolve the geometric and electronic structures of all S-states, correlating their structural features with spectroscopic observations to elucidate reactivity. The sequence of manganese oxidations and concomitant charge compensation events via proton transfer allow us to rationalize the multielectron S-state cycle. EPR spectroscopy combined with theoretical calculations provides a unique window into the tetramangenese complex, in particular its protonation states and metal ligand sphere evolution, far beyond the scope of static techniques such as X-ray crystallography. This approach has led, for example, to a detailed understanding of the EPR signals in the S-2-state of the OEC in terms of two interconvertible, isoenergetic structures. These two structures differ in their valence distribution and spin multiplicity, which has important consequences for substrate binding and may explain its low barrier exchange with solvent water.New experimental techniques and innovative sample preparations are beginning to unravel the complex sequence of substrate uptake/inclusion, which is coupled to proton release. The introduction of specific site perturbations, such as replacing Ca2+ with Sr2+, provides discrete information about the ligand environment of the individual Mn ions. In this way, we have identified a potential open coordination site for one Mn center, which may serve as a substrate binding site in the higher S-states, such as S-3 and S-4. In addition, we can now monitor the binding of the substrate water in the lower S-states (S-1 and S-2) using new EPR-detected NMR spectroscopies. These studies provided the first evidence that one of the substrates is subsumed into the complex itself and forms an oxo-bridge between two Mn ions. This result places important new restrictions on the mechanism of O-O bond formation. These new insights from nature's water splitting catalyst provide important criteria for the rational design of bioinspired synthetic catalysts.									385	11	0	0	118	2	392			0001-4842	1520-4898		WOS:000322086600022	23506074

In this study, a highly efficient sulphur vacancies-CdS@CuS core-shell heterostructure photocatalyst (denoted CdS-SV@CuS) was developed through the surface modification of CdS-sulphur vacancies (SV) nanoparticles by CuS based on photoinduced interfacial charge transfer (IFCT). This novel photocatalyst with modulated charge transfer was prepared by hydrothermal treatment and subsequent cation-exchange reactions. The SV confined in CdS and the IFCT facilitate the charge carrier's efficient spatial separation. The optimized CdS-SV@CuS(5%) catalyst exhibited a remarkably higher H-2 production rate of 1654.53 mu mol/g/h, approximately 6.7 and 4.0 times higher than those of pure CdS and CdS-SV, respectively. The high photocatalytic performance is attributed to the rapid charge separation, caused by the intimate interactions between CdS-SV and CuS in the core-shell heterostructure. This is the first time that a straightforward method is adopted to construct a metal sulphide core-shell structure for superior H-2-production activity by IFCT. (C) 2021 Elsevier Inc.

Unfortunately, the source of high catalytic activity in state-of-the-art doped nickel catalysts for urea oxidation reaction (UOR) activity remains poorly understood, hindering the rational design of new catalyst materials. In particular, the exact role of cobalt as a dopant in Ni(OH)(2) to maximize the intrinsic activity towards UOR remains unclear. In this work, we demonstrate how tuning the Ni:Co ratio allows us to control the intrinsic activity and number of active surface sites, both of which contribute towards increasing UOR performance. We show how Ni90Co10(OH)(2) achieves the largest geometric current density due to the increase of available surface sites and that intrinsic activity towards UOR is maximized with Ni20Co80(OH)(2). Through density functional theory calculations, we show that the introduction of Co alters the Ni 3d electronic state density distribution to lower the minimum energy required to oxidize Ni and influence potential surface adsorbate interactions.

To this end, the advent of sub-microsecond laser pulses has paved the way and eased the investigations of the electrochemical interface (e. g., electric double layer), which hitherto is difficult. The laser-induced current transient (LICT) and laser-induced potential transient (LIPT) techniques have proven to be valuable and unique tools for measuring key parameters of the electrified interface, such as the potential of maximum entropy (PME) and the potential of zero charge (PZC). Herein, we present a summary of studies performed in recent years using laser-induced temperature jump techniques. The relation between the PME/PZC and the electrocatalytic properties of various electrochemical interfaces are particularly highlighted. Special attention is given to its applications in investigating different systems and analyzing the influence of the electrolyte components, electrode composition and structure on the PME/PZC and various electrochemical processes. Moreover, possible applications of the LICT/LIPT techniques to investigate the interfacial properties of a myriad of materials, including surface-mounted metal-organic frameworks and metal oxides, are elaborated.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2196-0216			WOS:000745085300001

Yet the influence of Mn biooxide mineral structural evolution on Cr(III) oxidation under varying geochemical conditions is unknown. In this study we examined the role of light, organic carbon, pH, and the structure of biogenic Mn oxides on Cr(III) oxidation. Aging of Mn oxides produced by a marine bacterium within the widespread Roseobacter clade resulted in structural ripening from a colloidal hexagonal to a particulate triclinic birnessite phase. The structurally diverse Mn oxides were then reacted with aqueous Cr(III) within artificial seawater in the presence or absence of carbon and light. Here we found that Cr(III) oxidation capacity was highest at near neutral pH and in the combined presence of carbon and light. Mn oxide ripening from a hexagonal to a triclinic birnessite phase led to decreased Cr(III) oxidation in the presence of carbon and light, whereas no change in reactivity was observed in the absence of carbon and/or in the dark. As only minimal Cr(III) oxidation was observed in the absence of Mn oxides, these results strongly point to coupled Mn oxide-and photo-induced generation of organic and/or oxygen radicals involved in Cr(III) oxidation. Based on Mn oxide concentration and structural trends, we postulate that Mn(II) produced from the oxidation of Cr(III) by the primary Mn oxide is recycled in the presence of organics and light conditions, (re) generating secondary hexagonal birnessite and thereby allowing for continuous oxidation of Cr(III). In the absence of this Mn oxide regeneration, Cr(III) induced structural ripening of the hexagonal birnessite precludes further Cr(III) oxidation. These results highlight the complexity of reactions involved in Mn oxide mediated Cr(III) oxidation and suggest that photochemical carbon reactions are requisite for sustained Cr(III) oxidation and persistence of reactive Mn oxides.									60	5	0	0	41	0	64			2050-7887	2050-7895		WOS:000341016000008	25079661

The structural evolution of siderite in the process of coaling and its performance in the transformation of NO in the presence of NH3 were investigated in this work. In addition, the effects of the coexisting component, including vapor, SO2, and the alkali metal K, were also discussed. Heat treatment was performed at 450, 500, 550, 600, and 700 degrees C to obtain siderite-derived alpha-Fe2O3, which was then evaluated in de-NOx via the selective catalytic reduction (SCR) of NO with NH3 in a fixed bed. The X-ray diffraction (XRD), the X-ray fluorescence spectrometer (XRF), N-2 adsorption-desorption (BET), the X-ray photoelectron spectrometer (XPS), the scanning electron microscope (SEM), and the transmission electron microscope (TEM) were used to investigate the variations in the morphology and structure of the thermally treated siderite. The results showed that siderite was gradually oxidized and decomposed into alpha-Fe2O3 with a nanoporous structure and large surface area of 27.27 m(2) g(-1) after calcination under an air atmosphere. The alpha-Fe2O3 derived from siderite at 500 degrees C (H500) exhibited an excellent SCR performance, where the NO conversion rate was great than 90% between 250 and 300 degrees C due to the pore structure and high specific surface area, additional adsorbed oxygen states, abundant oligomeric Fe oxide clusters, and large amount of acid sites. Regardless of the vapor content, SO2 concentration, and reaction temperature, the alpha-Fe2O3 derived from siderite at 500 degrees C (H500) still favored the conversion of NO. When the reaction temperature was lower than 350 degrees C, H500 favored the conversion of NO even in the presence of an alkali metal (K). The experimental data demonstrated the positive effect of siderite-derived alpha-Fe2O3 in SCR technology and provided insight into NO behavior in coaling flue gas after NH3 injection.									6	0	0	0	2	0	6			0944-1344	1614-7499		WOS:000515702500015	31993902

In this study, we develop a novel active Ag1Pd1 alloy cocatalyst with selective exposed (111) facet for the conversion toxic formaldehyde into hydrogen driven by visible light via modulation of the adsorption of HCHO, H2O molecules and H atom on optimized crystal facet of alloy cocatalyst. The Ag1Pd1(111)/RGO catalyst shows more than two times higher catalytic activity than Ag1Pd1 (100)/RGO catalyst under same condition. By taking advantage of the more efficient charge transfer and separation, the prolonged the lifetime of photogenerated electrons has been achieved over (111) facet AgPd alloy. Our result provides a new insight to develop the active cocatalyst by modulating crystal facet of alloy cocatalyst for hydrogen generation from formaldehyde under visible light irradiation.

The NH3 demand has gradually increased with modern society development. Moreover, the electrocatalytic nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR) is a promising NH3 synthesis technology. However, the design of efficient electrocatalysts for the NRR is still challenging. In this study, we systematically analyzed transition metal (TM) single-atoms (Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Zr, Nb, and Mo) anchored on graphyne (GY) as NRR catalysts using density functional theory calculations. The calculation results for the first and last hydrogenation steps (*NNH formation and *NH3 desorption, respectively) revealed that Mn@GY (with an end-on configuration) and V@GY (with a side-on configuration) were the most suitable catalytic substrates for the NRR. The free-energy profiles of the TM@GY catalysts indicated that Mn@GY was the best NRR electrocatalyst owing to its distal pathway with a minimum free-energy barrier of 0.36 eV. In addition, the electronic properties, namely the Bader charge, charge density difference, partial density of states, and crystal orbital Hamilton population, of the TM@GY catalysts were analyzed in detail, and the results further confirmed that Mn@GY was an efficient electrocatalyst. The insights obtained from this comprehensive study can provide useful guidelines for designing new and efficient electrocatalysts.									28	1	0	0	0	0	26			1463-9076	1463-9084		WOS:000642434700001	33889880

The kind of mediator (NaCl or NaBr), its concentration, the current density, and the applied electric charge had a significant influence on the reaction course. In the case of Boc-Pro-Gly-OMe, the use of sodium bromide was necessary to obtain a relatively high ratio of alpha-monomethoxylation to alpha,alpha-dimethoxylation. For Boc-Val-Gly-OMe, the selectivity for alpha-monomethoxylation was close to 100%, independently of the mediator. Optimisation of the selected electrolysis parameters allowed us to significantly improve the yield and selectivity of the alpha-methoxylation of Boc-Pro-Gly-OMe (Kardassis et al. Tetrahedron 54: 3471, 1998) and to obtain good results in the alpha-methoxylation of Boc-Val-Gly-OMe.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0021-891X	1572-8838		WOS:000294477800007

Further electrolysis experiments revealed that the catalyst was present in the aqueous phase, despite the poor initial solubility of the pre-catalyst (1). In order to identify the actual form responsible for this important catalytic reaction, the aquo complex [Cu-II(ind)(OClO3)(OH2)]center dot CH3OH (2 center dot CH3OH) was structurally characterized. Spectroscopic investigations of a solid isolated from the buffer used in the electrolysis reaction and solution equilibrium studies using 2 indicated that the [Cu-II(ind)(OH)] form occurs at pH 10. Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy and DFT calculations confirmed a distorted {3N,O}(eq) coordination plane in solution, as found in 2. The buffer (i.e. bicarbonate/carbonate) may affect reactivity in two ways: as an external base facilitating the proton-coupled electron transfer steps; and/or displacing the inner-sphere solvent molecules from the favourable quasi-equatorial position, thus inhibiting the catalysis. Structural features of a tri-nuclear cluster [Cu-3(II)(ind)(3)(mu(3)-CO3)(CH3OH)(OClO3)] (3) isolated under basic conditions confirmed that beside acting as an external base, the inhibiting effect of carbonate anions may also play a role. In acetonitrile-water solutions, where both 1 and 2 exhibit reasonable solubility, experimental findings supported by DFT calculations suggest that it is the ind(-) ligand which is being oxidized while the cupric ion remains redox-inactive which is very unusual yet of great significance for the creation of a new generation of low-cost Cu-based water oxidation catalysts as well as potentially other 1st row transition metals.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			2044-4753	2044-4761		WOS:000686256900001

The size and distribution of the sputtered Pt NPs are found to be related to the nature of the support because Pt NPs are preferentially located at N-graphitic sites. In addition, Rutherford backscattering shows that a deeper penetration of the Pt NPs is obtained in the N-doped carbon support with larger pore diameters. The ligand effect of the N-doped carbon supports is found to occur by electron donation from N-pyrrolic and N-graphitic sites to the Pt NPs and the electron acceptor behavior of the C=N-pyridinic sites. The carbon matrix acquires a basic characteristic (electron-richer, metallic behavior) capable of interacting with metallic NPs akin to a bimetallic-like system. The imprinted Pt NPs are active catalysts for oxidation, although displaying poor catalytic activity for reduction reactions. The catalyst N-doped carbon supports play an important role in the overall catalytic process, rather than only acting as a simple active phase carrier.									16	2	0	0	0	0	17			0947-6539	1521-3765		WOS:000423351800021	29131930

Understanding how this immunity is established may define different profiles. Twelve healthy calve p were monitored during 8 time periods to assess the innate immune system during the first 90 d. Blood samples were collected, and the blood phagocytes, identified by the expression of CD14 and CH138 surface molecules, were evaluated for phagocytic functionality (Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli stained with propidium iodide) and the intracellular production of reactive oxygen species (2,7'-dichlorofluorescein diacetate oxidation). Functional changes in the CD14+ and CH138+ cells occurred at 40 d of age, with sporadic increases in phagocytosis intensity and reactive oxygen species production, and decreased phagocytosis occurred at 60 d of age. Therefore, fewer phagocytes were active from 40 d of age, although those that were active performed their roles with greater efficacy. That change presumably occurred because the calf phagocytes began to support the immune response without the influence of passive immunity. The animals failed to reach the stability needed to complete the maturation of the innate immune response by 90 d of age. These data are applicable for healthy calves only.									12	1	0	0	8	0	13			0022-0302	1525-3198		WOS:000364981600061	26476941	
J	Yang Hua; Qin Zhi-xin; Chen Zhi-zhong; Hu Cheng-yu; Hu Xiao-dong; Yu Tong-jun; Yang Zhi-jian; Zhang Guo-yi								Characteristics of Ni/Au contact to p-GaN annealed in air and oxygen ambient								Chinese Journal of Luminescence				25	6			691	5						2004	2004	As well-known, ohmic contacts play a very important role in the fabrication of GaN-based devices. Recently, Au/Ni/p-GaN ohmic contacts annealed in air or oxygen ambient have been studied extensively because of their low specific contact resistances and high transparency in the fabrication of GaN-based LEDs. The roles of Ni, Au layers and their oxidation on the formation of p-GaN ohmic contact are still under dispute. Few works on the structure evolution in the oxidized Ni/Au contact were reported. Moreover, the difference between O2 and air for the oxidation ambient was not ascertained yet. In this work, thermal annealing in air and oxygen ambient with different time were performed on Ni/Au contact to p-GaN. The structural and electrical properties of the oxidized Ni/Au/p-GaN samples were investigated by synchrotron radiation X-ray diffraction (XRD). The GaN samples used in our experiments were GaN-based LED grown by metalorganic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD). P-type GaN layer is about 200 nm thick. After Ni/Au(20 nm/40 nm) film was deposited by electron-beam deposition system, the samples annealed in oxygen or air for different time, 30, 60, 180, 300 and 600 s respectively. 2theta and omega scans XRD of the samples were measured by the synchrotron radiation source. As a result, obvious NiO peaks were detected by glancing incidence XRD in the annealing samples of Ni/Au contact to p-GaN. When the annealing time was changed from 0 to 600 s, the crystallinity of Au was improved. A preferentially orientation of Au(III) paralleled with GaN [0001] was observed by a scan (the rocking curve). It was believed that the Au went down to the interface and form the preferential orientation paralleling to GaN [0001] and the NiO was reversed to the surface. It suggested that the Au, Ni, O and Ga formed a kind of compound that is important to decrease the Schottky barrier. In the process, the dirty on interface was brought out to the surface, and maybe it could take some effect of lowering the Schottky barrier. It was observed that series resistance was reduced when the annealing time increased. The reduction of Au/Ni-p-GaN-Ni/Au series resistance meant the improvement of contact characteristics, which was related with the formation of the epitaxial Au and NiO. The formation speed of NiO annealed in oxygen ambient was faster than that annealed in air.									1	2	0	0	0	0	2			1000-7032			INSPEC:8536093

(1998) Biochim. Biophys. Acta 1365, 492-502), are involved in functional interaction with photosystem II (PSII). The ability of MSP to bind to its functional site on the PSII complex and to reactivate oxygen evolution was dramatically reduced by the substitution of Axg(152), Asp(158), Lys(160), or Axg(162) with uncharged residues, by insertion of a single residue between Phe(156) and Leu(157), or by deletion of Leu(157). Substitution of each of the four charged residues with an identically charged residue showed that the charges at Asp(158), and possibly Lys(160), are important for the electrostatic interaction with PSII The reactivating ability was also strongly affected by the alteration of Phe(156) to Leu. Replacement of Lys(188), the only strictly conserved charged residue in the Arg(184)-Ser(191) sequence, by Gln had only a marginal effect on the function of MSP. High affinity binding of MSP to PSII was also affected significantly by mutation at Axg(152), which is located in a region (Val(148)-Arg(152)) strictly conserved among the 14 sequences so far reported. These results imply that the Val(148)-Gly(163) sequence, which is well conserved among MSPs from cyanobacteria to higher plants, is a domain of MSP for functional interaction with PSII.									28	0	2	0	28	0	30			0021-9258			WOS:000175203000052	11809745

However, its low carrier mobility and extremely high charge recombination rate limits its practical application for PEC water splitting. Herein, we report the design and synthesis of a new co-catalyst, amorphous CexPO(4) nanoparticles, on a P-doped alpha-Fe2O3 nanosheet photoanode. As a new type of co-catalyst, the CexPO(4) nanoparticles were beneficial for depressing charge recombination and enhancing the reaction kinetics of O-2 evolution at the interface between the co-catalyst and electrolyte. As a result, the P-doped Fe2O3 loaded with the CexPO(4) co-catalyst showed high activity as a photoanode material for photoelectrochemical water oxidation. The photocurrent density exceeded 1.24 mA.cm(-2) at 1.23 versus reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) under an irradiation of 100 mWcm(-2), which was 3.5- and 1.4-fold higher than those obtained for the pristine hematite nanosheets and the P-doped hematite nanosheet photoanodes, respectively. Further investigations confirmed that the amorphous CexPO(4) co-catalyst favorably induced charge transfer and water oxidation in the PEC cell. This work highlights an effective strategy for the design and fabrication of a rare-earth-based co-catalyst for PEC water splitting.									64	2	0	0	4	0	64			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000445416900087

However, the conscious modulation of Z-scheme charge transfer is still a great challenge. Herein, interfacial Mo-S bond and internal electric field modulated Z-scheme heterostructure composed by sulfur vacancies-rich ZnIn2S4 and MoSe2 was rationally fabricated for efficient photocatalytic hydrogen evolution. Systematic investigations reveal that Mo-S bond and internal electric field induce the Z-scheme charge transfer mechanism as confirmed by the surface photovoltage spectra, DMPO spin-trapping electron paramagnetic resonance spectra and density functional theory calculations. Under the intense synergy among the Mo-S bond, internal electric field and S-vacancies, the optimized photocatalyst exhibits high hydrogen evolution rate of 63.21mmol.g(-1)h(-1) with an apparent quantum yield of 76.48% at 420nm monochromatic light, which is about 18.8-fold of the pristine ZIS. This work affords a useful inspiration on consciously modulating Z-scheme charge transfer by atomic-level interface control and internal electric field to signally promote the photocatalytic performance. The construction of Z-scheme heterostructures is of great significance for realizing efficient photocatalytic water splitting. Here, the authors report an interfacial chemical bond and internal electric field modulated Z-Scheme S-v-ZnIn2S4/MoSe2 photocatalyst for efficient hydrogen evolution.									136	4	0	0	12	0	137				2041-1723		WOS:000672713100001	34226543	
J	Liu, W; Li, XJ; Qin, KZ				Qin, Kezhang/K-4695-2017; Qin, Kezhang/B-6616-2012				Oxygen isotope exchange and flow geometry of meteoric-derived water within an alkali granite pluton: exchange mechanism and advective cooling.								ACTA PETROLOGICA SINICA				18	3			331	339						JUL 2002	2002	One-dimensional transport equations that include the mechanisms of advection, diffusion, hydrodynamic dispersion, and non-equilibrium exchange between water and rock were numerically solved and graphically illustrated. Two lithological groups, the northern marginal facies (NM) and the main body (MB), were distinguished within the Tasigake alkali granite pluton of Ulungur in northern Xinjiang, China. Perthite exhibits extensive exsolution with surrounding albite comb, whereas quartz grains are generally deformed. A volume increase resulting from perthite exsolution has exerted stress on the quartz grains, thus causing their deformation. Arfvedsonite grains are dominantly secondary and have been formed through metasomatism of aegirine-augite. In the delta(18)O-delta(18)O diagrams between quartz, perthite, and arfvedsonite, slopes of data trends were translated to relative exchange rates k(Quartz)/k(Perthite)/k(Arfvedsonite) ( = 1/5. 3/5. 0) that indicate surface-reaction as the oxygen isotope exchange mechanism. This, coupled with the microtextural characteristics, suggests that isotope exchange depends on mineral reactions. Application of the model of coupled mass transport and kinetically limited isotope exchange to the Tasigake pluton, established infiltration geometry of meteoric-derived water from the NM through the MB. The steep data trends and the low degrees of O-18-depletion of quartz and perthite from the NM are interpreted as resulting from interaction with an isotopically unevolved meteoric-derived water during a relatively short time-duration. However, interaction with an isotopically more evolved longer-path-length meteoric-derived water during a longer time-duration resulted in the gentle data trends and the higher degrees of O-18-depletion of quartz and perthite from the MB. This study shows that advective heat removal by circulating surface waters can be an important mechanism for cooling a granite pluton.									1	2	0	0	0	0	2			1000-0569			WOS:000177516200007

In contrast, plastids of C. odorata R. et P. and C. grandiflora H.B.K. do not contain any chlorophyll or possess thylakoids. Light-driven electron transport, as measured by oxygen evolution and indicated by analysis of chlorophyll fluorescence, was present in all chlorophyll-containing species. The photosystem II efficiency was low and ranged from 0.511 to 0.687. The plastid rbcL gene could not be detected in C. odorata, but was present in all other tested species. Neither rbcL transcripts nor the large subunit of ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase-oxygenase (Rubisco) could be detected in C. odorata and C. grandiflora. Low amounts of the large subunit of Rubisco were detected immunologically in all other Cuscuta species. Apparently, the genus Cuscuta comprises species with different degrees of plastid functionality, ranging from intact chloroplasts, via plastids with impaired protein production and gene expression to plastids with reduced plastome gene content.									59	1	0	0	58	0	61			0032-0935			WOS:000086975900002	10805440

Subsequent calculations of molecular O-2 adsorption to the optimal cluster structures reveal a size-dependent reactivity pattern that agrees well with earlier experiments. A detailed analysis of the underlying electronic structure shows that the chemical reactivity of the gold cluster anions can be elucidated in terms of a partial-jellium picture, where delocalized electrons occupying electronic shells move over the ionic skeleton, whose geometric structure is strongly influenced by the directional bonding associated with the highly localized "d-band" electrons.									191	2	0	0	10	1	192			1439-4235	1439-7641		WOS:000243502800021	17131433

Influence of oxidation and reduction reactions upon the coercivity								Key Engineering Materials				132-136				1428	31						1997	1997	Nanocrystalline Fe-based spinels with composition Fe2.5Ti0.5O4 are obtained by two different routes: soft chemistry and high-energy ball milling. In the first case, two steps are involved: precipitation in an aqueous solution followed by thermal treatment of the powder under reducing atmosphere given by N2/H2/H2O mixtures. In the second case, the spinel phase is directly formed in the mill at room temperature by milling Fe+Fe2O3+TiO2 in stoichiometric quantities under argon atmosphere. Powders obtained by soft chemistry are very well dispersed and homogeneous, their size determined by transmission electron microscopy and surface area measurements is about 40 nm. Powders obtained by ball-milling consist of aggregates of many small particles. The average size of the aggregates is approximately 100-500 nm as seen with SEM micrographs and the size of the small crystallites evidenced by TEM using dark field observations is about 15 nm. In each case, X-ray diffraction and Moessbauer spectroscopy evidence the spinel structure. The reactivity of the powder towards oxygen is studied by thermogravimetry and the influence of the oxidation and reduction reactions upon the magnetic properties of the particles is investigated, mainly the coercivity. Close correlations are revealed between the coercivity and the evolution of the spinel stoichiometry. The coercivity seems to depend on a combination of stresses and of the magnetostrictive properties of the Fe2+ cations. The stresses are induced by the milling and by the oxidation, as indicated by the correspondence between maxima of oxidation determined using differential thermogravimetric analysis and those of coercivity.					5th European Ceramic Conference.

Despite the lower mobility of Co atoms on TiO2 compared to Pt, STM experiments demonstrate that exclusively bimetallic clusters can be deposited through either order of deposition, provided that deposition of the first metal results in a sufficient density of seed clusters to nucleate all of the metal atoms from the second deposition. Bimetallic clusters of varying compositions were prepared by depositing different Co:Pt ratios at room temperature with a fixed total coverage of 0.25 ML. The average cluster heights decrease with increasing Co fraction since the higher Co coverage results in a greater number of nucleation sites. After heating to 800 K, the pure Pt clusters exhibit the greatest increase in average cluster height; however, both Pt and Co clusters become encapsulated with titania upon annealing to 800 K, which is also the onset temperature for Co desorption. Low energy ion scattering (LEIS) experiments show that for all bimetallic compositions studied, both Co and Pt atoms reside at the cluster surfaces although the surface composition is always richer in Pt than the bulk. Co-Pt clusters with a 55% Co fraction have nearly identical surface compositions, regardless of the order of Co and Pt deposition, and this behavior suggests that diffusion of atoms within the clusters is facile at room temperature. Furthermore, 55% Co-45% Pt clusters exhibit identical activity in terms of CO desorption and methanol reaction for both Co on Pt and Pt on Co. Temperature programmed desorption (TPD) experiments with CO indicate that CO desorbs from both Pt and Co sites on surfaces with high Co fractions, and the desorption temperature of CO decreases with increasing Co fraction. In the reaction of methanol on the pure and bimetallic clusters, CO and H-2 are produced as the main gaseous products on all surfaces. On the bimetallic surfaces, the selectivity for methane formation is higher than on either pure Co or Pt, and the bimetallic clusters are less active for C H bond scission than pure Co or Pt. CO evolution from methanol reaction appears to be desorption-limited, and the surface CO prefers to adsorb at Pt sites over Co sites.									12	3	0	0	3	0	13			1932-7447			WOS:000340222300068

A promising avenue toward sustainable energy conversion and storage is the synthesis and integration of electrocatalyst materials with interfaces that drive small-molecule electroreduction reactions like CO2 and CO conversion to fuels, as well as hydrogen production from water. While research advances in the past several decades have led to deployable technologies on both of these fronts, industrial scalability is undercut by high material cost, lack of catalyst selectivity, and poor long-term operational stability. In this perspective, we highlight the exceptional promise of multinary chalcogenides as an expansive yet underexplored composition space where catalytic functionality and synthesizability can be predicted and finely controlled by leveraging nominal composition, dimensionality, crystallinity, and morphology. We further outline a path forward for chalcogenide material discovery that integrates theory with experiment to rationally inform material design and accelerate the synthesis of functional energy materials.									7	0	0	0	1	0	7			0897-4756	1520-5002		WOS:000703532600001

Nanostructured transition metal carbides have attracted vast interest in fuel cell and electrolyser as electrocatalyst or support, due to its high conductivity and thermo-chemical stability. This paper provides a review in the recent experimental and theoretical studies on Titanium Carbides (TiC) as electro-catalyst and support for fuel cell and electrolyser. The morphologies of TiC show strong impact on the performance of the electrocatalyst in different oxidation and reduction reactions. This study discusses the electrochemical properties and synthesis processes for the development of different TiC nanostructure. The critical issues, challenges and the future perspective for TiC as electrocatalyst as well as electrocatalyst support in fuel cell and electrolyzer with desired activity and stability are also discussed.? 2021 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC.

The later q(dl)* has been proposed as a tool for the estimation of the relative surface area of the Ti/IrO2 electrodes.Differential electrochemical mass spectrometry (DEMS) measurements using (H2O)-O-18 has demonstrated that we are dealing with an active electrode in which the surface redox couple IrO3/IrO2 acts as mediator in the oxidation of formic acid (FA).From the voltammetric measurements using different IrO2 loading and FA concentrations, the kinetic parameters of FA oxidation via the surface redox couple IrO3/IrO2 have been determined.Finally a model has been proposed considering that FA oxidation at Ti/IrO2 anodes is controlled by mass transfer.

PCC 6803 carrying short deletions or a single-site mutation within the large, lumen-exposed loop (loop E) of the chlorophyll a-binding photosytem II core protein, CP47, are analyzed for their functional properties by measuring the flash-induced pattern of thermoluminescence, oxygen yield, anti fluorescence quantum yield. A physiological and biochemical characterization of these mutant strains has been given in two previous reports [Eaton-Rye, J. J., and Vermaas, W. F. J. (1991) Plant Mel. Biol. 17, 1165-1177; Haag, E., Eaten-Rye, J. J., Renger, G., and Vermaas, S. F. J. (1993) Biochemistry 32, 4444-4454]. The results of the present study show that deletion of charged and conserved amino acids in a region roughly located between residues 370 and 390 decreases the binding affinity of the extrinsic PS II-O protein to photosystem II. Marked differences with PSII-O deletion mutants are observed with respect to Ca2+ requirement and the flash-induced pattern of oxygen evolution. Under conditions where a sufficient light activation is provided, the psbB mutants assayed in this study reveal normal S-state parameters and lifetimes. The results bear two basic implications: (i) the manganese involved in water oxidation can still be bound ina functionally normal or only slightly distorted manner, and (ii) the binding of the extrinsic PS II-O protein to photosystem II is impaired in mutants carrying a deletion in the domain between residues 370 and 390, but the presence of the PS II-O protein is still of functional relevance for the PS II complex, e.g., for maintenance of a high-affinity binding site for Ca2+ and/or involvement during the process of photoactivation.									58	0	0	0	50	0	58			0006-2960			WOS:A1994PL35800008	7918426

It was characterized by scanning electron microscopy, energy dispersive spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction and cyclic voltammetry. The voltammetric results of the modified electrode showed a well redox activity for Ni nanoparticles which was improved by the presence of Co nanoparticles and reduced graphene oxide nanosheets. The electrochemical oxidation of methanol was investigated in alkaline media at Ni-Co/RGO/CPE. The obtained results showed that the presence of Ni-Co/RGO in the structure of electrocatalyst greatly enhance the electrocatalytic oxidation of methanol. The anodic peak potential of methanol oxidation was decreased to 0.65 V vs saturated calomel electrode and its current was greatly enhanced by Ni-Co/RGO/CPE. Also, the chronoamperometry technique was employed for obtaining the catalytic rate constant for the electmoxidation of methanol according to method of Galus as 1.05 M(-1)s(-1).									15	0	1	0	2	0	16			1293-2558	1873-3085		WOS:000504047900021

However, the electro-oxidation of ammonia is a complex process, especially the reaction intermediate has a slow toxic effect on the electrode. To reduce the catalyst poisoning by the absorption of intermediate, the constituent and structure of the catalysts must be deeply researched. In this work, carbon-supported Ir-Co alloy nanocomposites were prepared by pre-deposited method. X-ray diffraction (XRD), energy dispersive spectrometer (EDS) and high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) were used to measure the character of the nanocomposites. As expected, the Ir-Co/C nanocomposites revealed superior electro-catalytic activity towards the oxidation of ammonia in 0.4 M NaClO4 solution. The Ir-Co/C-modified GCE demonstrated high sensitivity for ammonia from a range of 0-2.5 M when using amperometry technique to simulate the ammonia-detected environment. At last, real sensor analysis was served to investigate the ammonia-detected performance of the Ir-Co/C, demonstrating high sensitivity and quick response compare to Ir/C and commercial Pt-Ru/C.									9	3	0	0	2	0	9			1572-6657	1873-2569		WOS:000464299500014

In this study, we used grand-canonical quantum mechanics (GC-QM) to keep the potential constant during the reactions (rather than keeping the charge constant as in standard QM) to investigate the effect of U on adsorption free energies (Delta Gs) of 14 CO2ER intermediates on Cu(111) as well as the intermediates involved in the competitive hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). In contrast to most previous theoretical studies where Delta Gs were calculated under constant charge (= 0, neutral), we calculated Delta Gs under constant potential (U = 0.0, -0.5, -1.0, and -1.5 V-SHE). By comparing the Delta Gs calculated under constant U (= 0.0 V-SHE) to those calculated under constant charge, we found differences up to 0.22 eV which would change the rates at 298 K by a factor of about 5300. In particular we found that the adsorption of species with a C=O functional group (i.e., *COOH, *CO, and *CHO) strengthened by up to 0.16 eV as U became more negative by 1 V, whereas the adsorption of -O- species (i.e., *OH, *OCH3, * OH, and *CHOH) weakened by up to 0.20 eV. For the (111) index surfaces of Cu, Au, Ag, Ir, Ni, Pd, Pt and Rh, we investigated the effect of U on the reaction free energy (Delta G) at pH = 0 for the crucial elementary steps for CO2ER (*CO + (H+/e(-)) -> *CHO, Delta G = (Delta G(*CHO) = Delta G(*CO)) + eU) and HER (* + (H+/e(-)) -> *H, Delta G = Delta G(*H) + eU. Our results indicated that the influence of U on (Delta G(*CHO) = Delta G(*CO)) was metal dependent. In contrast, the energy for converting a proton in solution to H* on the surface, Delta G(*H), was barely affected by U (for the studied metals). Overall we found substantial differences (MAD > 0.18 eV) between the Delta Gs calculated under U = -1.0 V-SHE (relevant to experiments) and those calculated under constant charge (= 0, neutral) common to most theoretical investigations. Therefore, we strongly recommend application GC-QM to obtain accurate energetics for CO2ER.									35	1	0	0	3	0	36			1463-9076	1463-9084		WOS:000423505500042	29318230

The refolded, continuous contact is a rodingite-type reaction zone with a centimetre-thick nephritic selvage of diopside + andradite/grossular +/- perovskite on the serpentinite side, followed towards the marble by a 1-5 cm thick zone of massive wollastonite (+/- grossular), followed by a 5-20 cm thick dark zone (the halo) consisting of wollastonite + quartz + graphitic material (+/- grossular +/- diopside), with no carbonate. The transition to the overlying wollastonite-free, calcite + quartz-bearing layers is sharp. Considering the stability of calcite + quartz everywhere else in the regional metamorphic series, this low-temperature occurrence of wollastonite (c. 400-450 degrees C) requires unusual conditions. A clue to its origin is the abundance of graphitic matter with the wollastonite within a few decimetres of the serpentinite body. We interpret this observation as evidence for local reduction of Ca-carbonate to form elemental carbon and wollastonite according to the reactionSiO2 + CaCO3 + 2H(2) -> CaSiO3 + C + 2H(2)O:A similar carbonate + mica reduction reaction is responsible for the disappearance of phengite and the appearance of grossular + carbon within a narrow zone in the marble above the wollastonite-quartz zone. Textural and solubility considerations suggest that the development of the zonal sequence is an essentially diffusive process. Thermochemical modelling of mineral stability in the successive reaction zones suggests a positive oxygen-fugacity gradient from the serpentinite to the marble (-6 < Delta FMQ < -1), mediated through a CH4- and H-2-bearing aqueous intergranular fluid. In line with the field evidence, it is calculated that a serpentinite body equilibrated at Delta FMQ -4 after oceanic serpentinization can still impose, through Fe2+-bearing serpentine oxidation, highly reducing conditions while entrained at depth in a subduction wedge and channel. This may contribute to the presence of H-2 +/- CH4 in the fluid and cause the destabilization of calcite in favour of graphite. In addition to the consequences for wollastonite and elemental carbon formation at low temperature, this finding has direct implications for redox conditions in subduction zones.									47	3	0	0	4	0	50			0022-3530	1460-2415		WOS:000299347800007		
J	Garvie, LAJ; Buseck, PR								Ratios of ferrous to ferric iron from nanometre-sized areas in minerals								NATURE				396	6712			667	670		10.1038/25334				DEC 17 1998	1998	Minerals with mixed valence states are widespread and form in many different rock types'. They can contain, for example, Fe(2+)-Fe(3+) and Mn(2+)-Mn(3+)-Mn(4+), with the ratios of oxidation states reflecting the redox conditions under which the host materials crystallized. The distribution of the ratio of iron (nr) to total iron content (Fe(3+)/Sigma Fe) in minerals reflects the oxidation states of their host rocks and is therefore important for answering fundamental questions about the Earth's evolution and structure(2-8). Iron is the most sensitive and abundant indicator of oxidation state, but many mineral samples are too fine-grained and heterogeneous to be studied by standard methods such as Mossbauer spectroscopy, electron microprobe, and wet chemistry. Here we report on the use of electron energy-loss spectroscopy with a transmission electron microscope to determine Fe(3+)/Sigma Fe in minerals at the nanometre scale. This procedure is efficient for determining Fe(3+)/Sigma Fe ratios of minor and major amounts of iron on a scale heretofore impossible and allows information to be obtained not only from ultra-fine grains but also, for example, at reaction fronts in minerals.									184	6	0	0	19	0	190			0028-0836			WOS:000077694200051

In this study, the hydrolytic weakening mechanisms of crystal alpha-quartz and amorphous silica glass were investigated in light of molecular simulation. A reactive force field was used to simulate the structure, dynamics and mechanical properties of the silica with water molecules during a uniaxial tensile process with loading rates from 0.02 to 0.16 ps-1. Dry silica samples, obtained by the temperature quenching method, and wet silica samples, formed by Grand Canonical Monte Carlo water adsorption, were prepared for mechanical tests. Structurally, water penetrating the silica cavity can form H-bonds with the neighboring bridging oxygen in the silicate network, leading to the elongation of the Si-O bonds and the enlargement of the Si-O-Si angles. Dynamically, the confined water molecules, with a high diffusion rate, collide with the silicate network, reducing the stability of the siloxane bonds. The reactive force field, coupled with the chemical and mechanical responses, provides new insights into the molecular structural evolution. During the tensile process, the siloxane bonds and Si-O-Si angles are initially stretched in the elastic region. Subsequently, the silica network depolymerizes into branch structures and, finally, the structure undergoes a tensioned fracture in a catastrophic manner. When the stress exceeds 30% of the tensile strength, water molecules in the silica system begin to dissociate into two reaction pathways, i.e. one governed by the chemical adsorption of water at a low stress level and the other dominated by the breakage of siloxane bonds at a high stress level. The stress-dependent water dissociation accelerates the depolymerization of the silica network, and brings about further irreversible deformation, which weakens the cohesive force of the silica.

The reduction of CO2 to CO is the first step toward the synthesis of more complex carbon-based fuels and chemicals. Therefore, understanding this step is crucial for the development of high-performance electrocatalyst for CO2 conversion to higher order products such as hydrocarbons. Here, atomic iron dispersed on nitrogen-doped graphene (Fe/NG) is synthesized as an efficient electrocatalyst for CO2 reduction to CO. Fe/NG has a low reduction overpotential with high Faradic efficiency up to 80%. The existence of nitrogen-confined atomic Fe moieties on the nitrogen-doped graphene layer is confirmed by aberration-corrected high-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy and X-ray absorption fine structure analysis. The Fe/NG catalysts provide an ideal platform for comparative studies of the effect of the catalytic center on the electrocatalytic performance. The CO2 reduction reaction mechanism on atomic Fe surrounded by four N atoms (Fe-N-4) embedded in nitrogen-doped graphene is further investigated through density functional theory calculations, revealing a possible promotional effect of nitrogen doping on graphene.									307	21	0	0	14	0	311			1614-6832	1614-6840		WOS:000437667800009		
J	Rajesh, C.; Majumder, C.								CO oxidation on Al-Au nano-composite systems								CHEMICAL PHYSICS				502				18	26		10.1016/j.chemphys.2017.12.011				MAR 6 2018	2018	Using first principles method we report the CO oxidation behaviour of Al-Au nano-composites in three different size ranges: Al6Au8, Al13Au42 and a periodic slab of Al-Au(111) surface. The clusters prefer enclosed structures with alternating arrangement of Al and Au atoms, maximising Au-delta-Al delta+ bonds. Charge distribution analysis suggests the charge transfer from Al to Au atoms, corroborated by the red shift in the density of states spectrum. Further, CO oxidation on these nano-composite systems was investigated through both Eley - Rideal and Langmuir Hinshelwood mechanism. While, these clusters interact with O-2 non-dissociatively with an elongation of the O-O bond, further interaction with CO led to formation of CO2 spontaneously. On contrary, the CO2 evolution by co-adsorption of O-2 and CO molecules has a transition state barrier. On the basis of the results it is inferred that nano-composite material of Al-Au shows significant promise toward effective oxidative catalysis. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

In present study, transcriptome signatures of cattle from Ladakh region(similar to 5500 m) and Sahiwal cattle from tropical regions were evaluated using Agilent 44 K microarray chip. The top up-regulated genes in Ladakhi cows were INHBC, ITPRI, HECA, ABI3, GPR171, and HIF-1 alpha involved in hypoxia and stress response. In Sahiwal cows, the top up-regulated genes eEF1A1, GRO1, CXCL2, DEFB3 and BOLA-DQA3 were associated with immune function and inflammatory response indicating their strong immune potential to combat the pathogens prevalent in the tropical conditions. The molecular pathways highly impacted were MAPK signaling, ETC, apoptosis, TLR signaling and NF-kB signaling pathway indicating signatures of adaptive evolution of these two cattle types in response to diverse environments. Further, qPCR analysis revealed increased expression of DEGs such as HIF-1, EPAS-1, VEGFA, NOS2, and GLUT-1/SLC2A1 in cattle types from high altitude suggesting their pivotal role in association with high altitude adaptation. Based on data generated, native cattle of Ladakh region was found to be genetically distinct from native cattle adapted to the tropical region of India.									20	4	0	0	18	0	24			2045-2322			WOS:000432274300006	29769561

The exact chemical composition of Pt-Ru catalysts has been determined using Xray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The deduced values of kinetic parameters: the Tafel slope (b(a)), the exchange current density (j(0)) and the rate constant (k(a)) as well as the order of the reaction (n) indicate significantly faster kinetics of the anodic oxidation of methanol on the Pt70Ru30 catalyst in comparison with the electrodeposited Pt. The maximum rate of oxidation is obtained at potentials at which the fractional coverage (0) of adsorbed species is governed by a Langmuir adsorption isotherm (DeltaG(ads) = -30 kJ mol(-1)) and majority of OHads species is consumed for oxidative removal of CO,, in an autocatalytic step in the Langmuir-Hinshelwood type of reaction. Kinetic analysis and the obtained value of the diffusion coefficient of the order of 10(-7) cm(2)s(-1) suggest that the rate-limiting interaction mechanism between COads and OHads species involves fast surface diffusion of COads from Pt sites to active Ru sites.									30	2	0	0	0	2	31			1480-2422			WOS:000223927700004

Herein, dual-phased Ni0.85Se/NiSe2 coupling with N doped carbon (Ni0.85Se/NiSe2@NC-2) in situ is prepared by a solvotherma-lselenization pathway. Benefiting from the collective promotion of the dual-phased composition and the NC support, Ni0.85Se/NiSe2@NC provides abundant active sites, enhanced electrical conductivity. It delivers a current density of 252 mA cm(-2) at 1.6 V vs RHE with a small Tafel slop of 64.4 mV dec-1 and gets a lower reaction barrier. Moreover, it requires a cell voltage of 1.46 V to approach 50 mA cm(-2), about 250 mV less than that of water electrolysis, confirming the less energy consumption. Notably, the N doped carbon protects Ni0.85Se/NiSe2 nanocrystals from aggregation leading to a faster CO2 desorption from Ni sites, which endow the Ni0.85Se/ NiSe2@NC-2 a much better working stability. The direct urea hydrogen peroxide fuel cell (DUHPFC) achieves a maximum power density of 9.09 mW cm(-2) at 20 ?. This work extends highly efficient dual-phased structure loading in NC catalysts system for urea-assisted energy conversion. (C) 2022 Elsevier Inc.

Herein, we report a facile protocol for preparing S, N-doped graphene with simultaneous ferroferric oxide functionalization (Fe3O4-SNG), which is then used as support to anchor Pt nanoparticles for catalyzing the anodic reaction of direct methanol fuel cells (DMFCs), the promising portable power sources that have small environmental footprint, compact system design, and higher volumetric energy density compared with existing technologies. The functionalization by Fe3O4 as well as S and N doping increases the defect level in graphene, and also affect the subsequent growth of Pt particles, leading to formation of Pt nanoparticles with worm-like morphology on the surface of Fe3O4-SNG support (Pt/Fe3O4-SNC). The electrochemical evaluations show that the worm-like Pt nanoparticles anchored on Fe3O4-SNG have larger electrochemically active surface areas and enhanced specific activities for methanol oxidation reaction (MOR) due to their strong electronic interaction with the supports, which also promotes the oxidative removal of the intermediate poisoning products formed during methanol electrooxidation, thereby improving the long-term stability of the Pt catalyst.

Beyond the applicability domain of this new approximation, the homogeneous background method (HBM) which is a potential dependent density functional theory method is then presented. HBM allows computing and extracting, at ab initio level, electrochemical properties of molecules either adsorbed or in the double layer. In particular, quantitative redox potential and number of exchanged electrons can be computed giving access to non-integer electron exchange or decoupled electron/proton transfer reactions. Tools for rationalizing electrochemical reactivity consisting of potential dependant projected density of states, Fukui function and metallicity index are defined. The methodology and tools are applied to examples relevant to the energy domain in order the compare reactivity in the outer Helmholtz plane and at the surface. Then, the combination of HBM and reactivity create a toolbox usable to predict and investigate the different redox, degradation and ageing processes occurring at an electrochemical interface such as the one found in energy materials but also in all electrochemical applications.									18	0	0	0	0	0	18			1463-9076	1463-9084		WOS:000537251100014	32103225

In recent decades, the development and study of molecular complexes for water oxidation have allowed insight into the principles governing catalytic activity and the mechanism as well as establish ligand design guidelines to improve performance. However, their durability and long-term stability compromise the performance of molecular-based artificial photosynthetic devices. In this context, heterogenization of molecular water oxidation catalysts on electrode surfaces has emerged as a promising approach for efficient long-lasting water oxidation for artificial photosynthetic devices. This review covers the state of the art of strategies for the heterogenization of molecular water oxidation catalysts onto electrodes for (photo)electrochemical water oxidation. An overview and description of the main binding strategies are provided explaining the advantages of each strategy and their scope. Moreover, selected examples are discussed together with the the differences in activity and stability between the homogeneous and the heterogenized system when reported. Finally, the common design principles for efficient (photo)electrocatalytic performance summarized.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3				2073-4441		WOS:000754864700001

Despite considerable research on transition metal oxides/hydroxides, especially NiFe based hydroxides as OER electrocatalysts, poor conductivity of these materials plagues their catalytic efficiency. In contrast, lack of catalytic centers hinders the OER performance of conductive metals. Herein, we devised a suitable precondition strategy to transform only the surface of conductive metallic Ni nanowires into active catalytic centers. The resulting material with intimate contact between the electrically conductive core and electrocatalytically active surface showed promising "specific" and "geometric" electrocatalytic activity towards the alkaline OER at different pH. Upon iron incorporation, the Fe centers incorporated at the surface as well as in the bulk of the nanowires were found to further boost the OER activity of these materials. A one-pot strategy was adopted to produce iron free/incorporated Ni nanowires covered with nano-spikes. Growth analysis revealed a unique "non-classical amorphous-to-crystalline transformation" to be responsible for the formation of metallic nanowires.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			2516-0230			WOS:000536705700015	36132518

Here we report on low-temperature (-15 to 45 degrees C) reversal degradation due to hydrogen starvation and evaluate the use of a reversal-tolerant anode (RTA) with an oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalyst (e.g., iridium oxide). During subfreezing cell reversal, we observed a water electrolysis cell voltage plateau, but the typically subsequent voltage plateau for carbon corrosion usually seen at high temperatures was not found. Repeated cell-reversal tests at subfreezing temperature shows a much slower degradation rate compared with that of high-temperature reversals. A series of isothermal reversal tests at different temperatures indicate that the degradation rate related with carbon corrosion is temperature dependent. As for the effect of RTA on the cell-reversal behavior, we found at subfreezing temperatures that the voltage reversal duration time of the MEA with RTA is similar to that of the MEA without RTA. However, once the cell temperature was sufficiently above freezing, such as during the heating of the startup process, the MEA with RTA would facilitate water electrolysis reactions by consuming water and delaying the onset of carbon corrosion. Thus, our results show that cell reversal with subfreezing internal temperatures does not substantially degrade the anode by carbon corrosion, but rather, the findings show that as the cell warms, an RTA is one approach to extend the survival of the fuel cell stack.									17	1	0	0	0	0	17			2574-0962			WOS:000502688800023

Morphological and structural properties of as-prepared electrodes were determined by SEM, XRD, and XPS. Linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) and accelerated life test were used to determine the electrocatalytic activity and stability of as-prepared electrodes. Higher oxygen evolution potentials (OEP) and longer service life were used to confirm the maximum electrocatalytic activity of Nd and Ce-PbO2 electrodes. The electro-oxidation ability was examined with Acid Orange 7 (AO 7) treatments. Cyclic voltammetry (CV), UV-visible, and fluorescence spectrophotometric analysis of AO 7 treatment were confirmed that Nd and Ce-PbO2 have excellent oxidation ability, higher AO 7 removal efficiency and higher total organic carbon (TOC) with a good correlation of instantaneous current efficiency (epsilon(inst)) and higher hydroxyl radical ((OH)-O-center dot) generation rate, respectively. The effect of removal parameters was optimized with Ce-PbO2 electrode. Results of AO 7 and TOC removal were reached up to 100% and 93.7%, respectively, after 180 min of electrolysis at the optimum condition of 0.2 M Na2SO4 concentration, 100 mg L-1 initial dye concentration, solution pH 7.0 and 20 mA cm(-2) applied current density. Reusability and safety test analysis were used to detect the best results of AO 7 degradation with Ce-PbO2 electrode. Mass spectroscopy and ion chromatography (IC) were used to detect the formation of intermediates by-products. Finally, based on the detection of reaction by-products, a plausible degradation pathway including radical reactions, ring opening and de-nitrification was proposed.

J	Rodgers, SD; Charnley, SB				Charnley, Steven B/C-9538-2012				Chemical differentiation in regions of massive star formation								ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL				546	1			324	329		10.1086/318263				JAN 1 2001	2001	We have reexamined the origin of the apparent differentiation between nitrogen-bearing molecules and complex oxygen-bearing molecules that is observed in hot molecular cores associated with massive protostars. Observations show that methanol is an ubiquitous and abundant component of protostellar ices. Recent observations suggest that ammonia may constitute an appreciable fraction of the ices toward some sources. In contrast to previous theories that suggested that N/O differentiation was caused by an anticorrelation between methanol and ammonia in the precursor grain mantles, we show that the presence of ammonia in mantles and the core temperature are key quantities in determining N/O differentiation. Calculations are presented which show that when large amounts of ammonia are evaporated alkyl cation transfer reactions are suppressed and the abundances of complex O-bearing organic molecules greatly reduced. Cooler cores (100 K) eventually evolve to an oxygen-rich chemical state similar to that attained when no ammonia was injected, but on a timescale that is an order of magnitude longer (similar to 10(5) yr). Hotter cores (300 K) never evolve an O-rich chemistry unless ammonia is almost absent from the mantles. In this latter case, a complex O-rich chemistry develops on a timescale of similar to 10(4) yr, as in previous models, but disappears in about 2 X 10(5) yr, after which time the core is rich in NH3, HCN, and other N-bearing molecules. There are thus two ways in which N-rich cores can occur. We briefly discuss the implications for the determination of hot-core ages and for explaining N/O differentiation in several well-studied sources.									115	2	0	0	0	0	115			0004-637X			WOS:000166280400028	11878346

For the experimental setup a coaxial reactor vertically placed was used. Wherein a liquid solution flowing inside the internal electrode was impelled by a peristaltic pump and falling over the external surface of the internal electrode. Working gas was applied in a parallel direction respect to the surface of the liquid and inside of the quartz tube. Non-thermal plasma was generated at the gas-liquid interface in Ar-O-2 gas mixtures with a high-voltage power supply system. The electric power applied ranged from 10-60W at a 3.0 kHz frequency. The initial concentration of m-cresol was of 5x10(-3) mol/L, and the removal efficiency up to 97.3% was obtained after 1 h of treatment. For the theoretical study a simplified model of the chemical kinetics was developed where the temporary evolution of the compounds generated in the process of degradation of the m-cresol was analyzed. Byproducts as oxalic acid and CO2 were found.					12th European Plasma Conference on High-Tech Plasma Processes (HTPP)12th European Plasma Conference on High-Tech Plasma Processes (HTPP)	JUN 24-29, 2012JUN 24-29, 2012	Univ Degli Studi Bari Aldo Moro; Comune Bologna; Univ Bologna, Alma Mater Studiorum; Simba Seventh Framework Programme; Air Liquide; Cebora; Centro Sviluppo Materiali S P A; TEKNA Plasma Syst Inc; Umicore; EMPA; EWM; HIDEN ANALYT; NAC Image Technol; Plasma Sources Sci & TechnolUniv Degli Studi Bari Aldo Moro; Comune Bologna; Univ Bologna, Alma Mater Studiorum; Simba Seventh Framework Programme; Air Liquide; Cebora; Centro Sviluppo Materiali S P A; TEKNA Plasma Syst Inc; Umicore; EMPA; EWM; HIDEN ANALYT; NAC Image Technol; Plasma Sources Sci & Technol	Bologna, ITALYBologna, ITALY	2	0	0	0	0	0	2			1742-6588	1742-6596	*****************	WOS:000314395400026

Development of new cost-effective materials coupled with the green synthesis routes in order to replace the noble metal-based catalysts is critical to overcoming this challenge. In this review, a brief summary of the recent progress in ternary layered Cu2MX4 (M = Mo, W; X = S, Se) nanomaterials and their photocatalytic performance is presented. First, the structural configurations with different phases and crystallinity are described, as well as various experimental synthesis methods of Cu2MX4 nanomaterials. Thereafter, the effect of morphology modulation, facet selection, and multicomponent hybridization on the catalytic activity of Cu2MX4 is elucidated. In addition, a proposal for highly-efficient Cu2MX4 photocatalysts is presented via rational designing strategies for realizing their specific applications in the fields of photodegradating organic pollutants, water splitting, and other photocatalytic reactions.

Interestingly, not only the perovskite rare earth cobaltites but also solid solutions of Co3+ in cubic rare earth sesquioxides exhibit catalytic activity comparable to LaCoO3, the Co3+ ion in all these oxides also being in the IS t(2g)(5)e(g)(1) state.

A quite slow degradation is found for the solution with 1 mM Cu2+ due to the low production of oxidizing hydroxyl radical (OHcircle) from anodic oxidation of water and the action of the Cu2+/Cu+ system. Electro-Fenton treatment with 1 mM Fe2+ leads to a high concentration of OHcircle in the medium from Fenton's reaction, but less than 70% of the nitrobenzene is mineralized since stable complexes of Fe3+ with products are formed. These complexes are quickly photodecomposed in the photoelectro-Fenton treatment of the same solution under UVA irradiation, leading to overall depollution at low currents. Complete degradation is also feasible using 1 mM Cu2+ and 1 mM Fe2+ at high current because OHcircle can slowly destroy the complexes between Cu2+ and intermediates. The positive synergetic effect of all catalysts allows the quickest nitrobenzene mineralization using 1 mM Cu2+ and 1 mM Fe2+ under UVA irradiation. The nitrobenzene decay always follows a pseudo-first-order reaction. Aromatic products such as o-nitrophenol, m-nitrophenol, p-nitrophenol and 4-nitrocatechol have been followed by reverse-phase chromatography. Nitrate ions are formed from oxidation of nitroaromatic; products. Generated carboxylic acids such as maleic, fumaric and oxalic have been detected by ion-exclusion chromatography. The different evolution of complexes of oxalic with Cu2+ and Fe3+ explains the influence of the catalysts on nitrobenzene degradation.									138	10	0	0	45	5	144			1144-0546	1369-9261		WOS:000189352700025

Especially, single-atom catalysts (SACs) have attracted more attention owing to their high specific surface areas and abundant active centers. This review summarizes recent synthetic strategies to fabricate SACs with different metal loadings on various supports, and the structural influence of supports on metal loading. Then, the functions of SACs are illustrated on electronic structure and electrocatalysis; the isolated SACs with an unsaturated coordination environment generally accelerate the electrocatalytic process and promote the selectivity. The applications of SACs to some typical electrocatalytic reactions are also introduced in detail, as well as to electrochemical energy storage and conversion systems. Finally, the challenges and the perspectives of SACs are discussed for future exploration. (C) 2021 Science Press and Dalian Institute of Chemical Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences.

Complex 1 has been found to be a stable and homogeneous water oxidation catalyst (WOC) in 0.1 M phosphate buffer (pH 8.0). A series of experiments (rinse test, SEM, EDX spectroscopy) confirm that this complex acts as a molecular electrocatalyst, and not a precursor of CoOx. The electrocatalytic water oxidation proceeds with high faradaic efficiency (81%) and fast rate (85 s(-1)). Analysis of the electrochemical reaction kinetics by foot-of-the-wave (FOWA) methodology reveals a high turnover frequency of 1.6 x 10(4) s(-1) which is comparable to the best performing Ru-based WOCs.									23	1	0	0	2	0	23			1477-9226	1477-9234		WOS:000538134300026	32412571

Broken symmetry density functional theory calculations combined with Heisenberg-Dirac-van Vleck spin ladder calculations show that an open cubane form of the water-oxidizing complex changes from a low-spin, S = 1/2, to a high-spin, S = 5/2, form on protonation of the bridging O4 oxo. We show that such models are fully compatible with structural determinations of the S-2 state by X-ray free-electron laser crystallography and extended X-ray absorption fine structure and provide a clear rationale for the effect of various treatments on the relative populations of each form observed experimentally in electron paramagnetic resonance studies.									26	1	0	0	8	0	26			1948-7185			WOS:000484884300070	31429574

This is a new operational system that measures chromatographically separated DOC compounds with a total inorganic/organic carbon analyzer (TCA) interfaced with an isotope ratio mass spectrometer (IRMS), and it represents a significant contribution to analytical technology.Leachate samples were collected from the Trail Road Landfill (TRL) site located about 25 km to the west of the city of Ottawa, Canada. Measurements of Eh, pH, electrical conductivity, dissolved oxygen, total dissolved solids, and temperature were completed at the field site. High performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) was used to separate DOC components into fractions for separate analysis on TCA. The TCA is operated in-line with a Thermo-Finnigan Delta(Plus) continuous-flow isotope ratio mass spectrometer (CF-IRMS) that oxidises organic carbon to CO2 for measurement of both concentration, by infrared absorption, and 613 C. DOC fraction collection was based on the detection of discrete peaks of individual compounds, allowing identification of key peaks, such as acetate, with recoveries of up to 100%. The difference in delta(13)C values for leachate acetate (-10.7 parts per thousand to -16.9 parts per thousand VPDB) and the bulk DOC (-24.7 parts per thousand VPDB) can be used to distinguish landfill leachate derived DOC and identify biogeochemical reactions. The enrichment of delta(13)C in the acetate suggests that this biologically derived compound has become a substrate for secondary biogeochemical reaction, likely methanogenesis.

To date, however, cyclability of lithium-air batteries has been low, insufficient for commercial use. Many recent research accounts focused on understanding the mechanism of the discharge reaction in attempts to improve the cyclability, and revealed that two structurally distinct lithium peroxide species form during discharge, thin films and toroids, among which toroids formation results in beneficial effects in both cyclability and overall discharge capacity. In this work, scanning electrochemical microscopy was applied to investigate electron transfer dynamics of the two lithium peroxide species, from which a much faster surface electron transfer was observed from lithium peroxide toroids compared to that of thin films. The difference is postulated to stem from the difference in the formation mechanism of the two species.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0253-2964	1229-5949		WOS:000780640000001

The sulfate solution had a pH of 2 and the electrodeposition was performed at 313 K. The effects of PEG on the co-deposition of the Zr oxides and V oxides and their polarization behavior were investigated. Additionally, the effects of PEG on the microstructure of the deposits were investigated. Although the Zr content in the deposits obtained from the Zn-Zr solution without PEG was approximately zero, it increased significantly at a current density above 1000 A m(-2) following the addition of PEG. In the Zn -V solution, the V content in the deposits obtained from 100 A m(-2) to 2000 A m(-2) was higher with PEG than that without PEG. In the presence of PEG, the cathode potential polarized, the rate of hydrogen evolution increased, and the hydrolysis reaction of Zr4+ and VO2+ ions occurred easily. This resulted in the Zr content and V content increasing in the deposits. Additionally, the crystal platelets of Zn in the Zn-Zr oxide film and the Zn-V oxide film became fine, and the surface coverage of the spongiform Zr oxide and the film-like V oxide increased. Furthermore, the corrosion current densities of the Zn-Zr oxide film and the Zn-V oxide film obtained from the solution with PEG were lower than those from the solution without PEG. The reduction reaction of dissolved oxygen decreased in the films with PEG, thereby decreasing the corrosion current density.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0021-4876	1880-6880		WOS:000514179200003

The magnitude of the zircon Ce anomaly has been traditionally described by Ce/Ce*, where Ce* is the theoretical Ce value derived from a chondrite-normalized rare earth element (REE) pattern. More recently, the Ce4+/Ce3+ method based on the lattice strain model has been proposed, since the latter method does not need La and Pr contents for zircon, both of which are commonly below the limit of detection and susceptible to contamination from melt/mineral inclusions. In this contribution we show that the Ce4+/Ce3+ method is confronted with some problems in practice and should be further improved. In contrast, by re-examining chondrite-normalized REE patterns of zircon, we find that Ce* can be estimated according to a logarithmic function curve without involvement of La and Pr contents. Application of this new method to zircon data from 11 giant to supergiant porphyry Cu deposits suggests this revised method as a more valid measure in evaluating magmatic oxidation state. The revised Ce/Ce* method is of particular importance for analyses where the provenance of the analyzed zircon is unknown or in question, since the method does not require knowledge of the melt composition.									41	5	0	0	0	0	41			0930-0708	1438-1168		WOS:000496454400003

We investigate the T-s-dependent evolution of microstructure and composition across the Zr/Al2O3(0001) interfaces using X-ray diffraction, transmission electron microscopy, and X-ray energy dispersive spectroscopy. We obtain fully-dense, close-packed hexagonal structured Zr(0001) thin films with smooth surfaces at 873 K <= T-s <= 973 K and increasingly porous, 0002-textured layers with highly corrugated surfaces at T-s > 1023 K. At the Zr/Al2O3 interfaces, we observe thin crystalline films of Zr-Al intermetallic compounds, whose thicknesses increase from 10 +/- 4 nm at T-s = 873 K to 116 +/- 4 nm at T-s = 1173 K. The interfacial layers are composed of hexagonal Ni2In-structured Zr2Al phase at T-s = 973 K and both orthorhombic-structured Zr2Al3 and hexagonal Mn5Al3-structured Zr5Al3 phases at T-s > 973 K. The thicknesses of both the intermetallic phases increase with increasing T-s, however, the Zr2Al3 layer grows faster than the Zr-rich phase at higher T-s. We attribute the formation of Zr-rich Zr2Al, rather than the thermodynamically more stable Al-rich Zr2Al3 layers, to the presence of dissolved oxygen and epitaxial registry with Al2O3(0001). Our results indicate that reaction-diffusion kinetics rather than thermodynamics govern the interfacial layer composition and we suggest that the Zr/Al2O3(0001) interfacial stability is controlled by the supply of Al from the Al2O3(0001) substrate during sputter-deposition of Zr.

The emphasis is on reaction mechanisms, structures, and modeling. The accuracy of different functionals is discussed for standard benchmark tests of first- and second-row molecules and for transition metal systems. Modeling aspects of the protein metal complexes are discussed regarding both the size of the model being treated quantum mechanically and the treatment of the protein surrounding it. To illustrate the effects, structures computed without the effects of the protein are compared with experimental structures from enzymes, and results from simple dielectric models of the protein for electron transfer processes are described. The choice of spin state is discussed for multimetal complexes. Examples of mechanisms studied recently by density functional theory are described, such as O-2 and methane activation in methane monooxygenase and O-2 formation in photosystem II.									252	2	0	0	54	2	253			0066-426X			WOS:000084557100009	15012412	
J	Siegbahn, PEM; Blomberg, MRA; Crabtree, RH								Hydrogen transfer in the presence of amino acid radicals								THEORETICAL CHEMISTRY ACCOUNTS				97	1-4			289	300		10.1007/s002140050264				OCT 1997	1997	Quantum chemical model studies of hydrogen transfer between amino acids in the presence of radicals have been performed using the density functional theory method B3LYP. These studies were made to investigate alternative mechanisms to the conventional electron transfer-proton transfer mechanisms. The model reactions studied are such that the net result of the reaction is a transfer of one neutral hydrogen atom. Simple models are used for the amino acids. Three different mechanisms for hydrogen transfer-were found. In the first of these, a transition state with a protonated intermediate residue is found: in the second, the proton and electron take different paths and in the third, a neutral hydrogen atom call be identified along the reaction pathway. A key feature of these mechanisms is that charge separation is always kept small in contrast to the previous electron transfer-proton transfer mechanisms. It is therefore proposed that the processes normally considered as electron transfer-in the biochemical literature could in fact be better explained as hydrogen atom transfer, at least in cases where a suitable hydrogen bonded chain pathway is present in the protein. The presence of such chains in principle allows the protein to define the path of net hydrogen transfer. Another important conclusion is that standard quantum chemical methods can be used to treat these mechanisms for hydrogen transfer, allowing for an accurate representation of the geometric changes during the reactions.									76	1	0	0	23	0	76			1432-881X			WOS:A1997YC02500033

The experiments were carried out in an electrochemical flow cell connected to inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer. Avariety of electrochemical treatments using different voltage scan rates confirmed the previously observed primary platinum degradation mechanism - the so-called "transient dissolution". Importantly, the redeposition of dissolved platinum is now shown to play an important role in the overall effective Pt dissolution. Pt redeposition trends exhibit a significant dependence on voltage scan rate. (C) The Author(s) 2018. Published by ECS.									52	0	0	0	3	0	52			0013-4651	1945-7111		WOS:000431807600020

However, very little is known of the pathways that metabolize these molecules or turn off the signals. The paradigm is well exemplified in bacteria where S-nitrosothiols (SNO)-compounds identified with antimicrobial activities of NO synthase-elicit responses that mediate bacterial resistance by unknown mechanisms. Here we show that Escherichia coli possess both constitutive and inducible elements for SNO metabolism. Constitutive enzyme(s) cleave SNO to NO whereas bacterial hemoglobin, a widely distributed flavohemoglobin of poorly understood function, is central to the inducible response. Remarkably, the protein has evolved a novel heme-detoxification mechanism for NO. Specifically, the heme serves a dioxygenase function that produces mainly nitrate. These studies thus provide new insights into SNO and NO metabolism and identify enzymes with reactions that were thought to occur only by chemical means. Our results also emphasize that the reactions of SNO and NO with hemoglobins are evolutionary conserved, but have been adapted for cell-specific function.									242	3	0	0	217	0	251			0027-8424			WOS:000077191200022	9826660

Due to their well-defined, precisely located metal centers, unique metal-support interaction and identical coordination environment, these catalysts serve as excellent models for understanding the fundamental issues in catalysis as well as exhibiting intriguing practical applications. Understanding the correlations between metal-support combinations and the catalytic performance at the atomic level can be achieved on the SACs@2D materials nanoplatforms. Herein, recent advances of metal SACs on various types of 2D materials are reviewed, especially their exciting applications in the fields of chemicals, energy, and the environment. Based on the summary and perspectives, this work should contribute to the rational design of perfect metal SACs with versatile properties.									90	5	0	0	6	0	90				2198-3844		WOS:000482978800001	31728296

Values of pH as low as 1 have been observed in the groundwater. After decommissioning, mine pits are generally converted to lakes which may also be acidic owing to the acidic groundwater discharge. The acidic effluent is generated by sulphide oxidation in the unsaturated zone of the spoil pile which generally extends to large depths as a result of dewatering. The long-term evolution of the acidification is still largely unknown.Our research focuses on the effects of physical and chemical heterogeneity caused by mixing of soil materials that may have already been oxidized to different degrees during the deposition of the spoil pile. Processes considered include variably saturated groundwater flow, oxygen diffusion in the soil gas, kinetic pyrite oxidation and acidic effluent generation, advective-dispersive transport of the aqueous components, equilibrium geochemical reactions between the chemical components and the soil minerals, and possible buffering and acid neutralization. Several existing numerical codes were coupled to represent the complete set of processes.Simulations were carried out in one and two dimensions using representative characteristics of mine spoil piles, with the two-dimensional representation being based on spatially heterogeneous random fields of hydraulic conductivity and sulphide mineral fractions. Results show the long-term evolution of the oxidation front, the mass flux of oxidation products and the effects of system heterogeneity. Under conditions of constant flow, the system is found to return to neutral conditions over a time period on the order of several decades. Further work, including sensitivity analyses with respect to the controlling parameters and model calibration using site-specific field data, will be necessary to obtain a full understanding of the complex interacting mechanisms. The simulation approach shows promise as a potentially useful tool for predicting the effects of sulphide oxidation on the water quality of pit lakes. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B,V.

On the other hand, it is still very challenging to develop universal descriptors that can be used in various types of catalysts and reaction systems. For these reasons, several strategies have recently been proposed to break and rebuild scaling relations to go beyond the top of volcanoes. In this review, some previously proposed descriptors have been briefly introduced. Then, the strategies for breaking known and establishing new and more generalized scaling relations in complex catalytic systems have been summarized. Finally, the application of machine-learning techniques in identifying universal descriptors for future computational design and high-throughput screening of heterogeneous catalysts has been discussed.

Heterogeneous catalysts are especially appealing because of their high stability and the relative ease with which they may be recovered and reused. Computational modeling can play an important role in the design of more catalytically active materials through the identification of reaction mechanisms and the opportunity to assess hypothetical catalysts in silico prior to experimental verification. Kohn-Sham density functional theory (KS-DFT) is the most commonly used method in computational catalysis because it is affordable and it gives results of reasonable accuracy in many instances. Furthermore, it can be employed in a "black-box" mode that does not require significant a priori knowledge of the system. However, KS-DFT has some limitations: it suffers from self-interaction error (sometime referred to as delocalization error), but a greater concern is that it provides an intrinsically single-reference description of the electronic structure, and this can be especially problematic for modeling catalysis when transition metals are involved. In this Perspective, we highlight some noteworthy applications of KS-DFT to heterogeneous computational catalysis, as well as cases where KS-DFT fails to describe accurately electronic structures and intermediate spin states in open-shell transition metal systems. We next provide an introduction to state-of-the-art multiconfigurational (MC; also referred to as multireference (MR)) methods and their advantages and limitations for modeling heterogeneous catalysis. We focus on specific examples to which MC methods have been applied and discuss the challenges associated with these calculations. We conclude by offering our vision for how the community can make further progress in the development of MC methods for application to heterogeneous catalysis.									49	1	0	0	2	0	49			2155-5435			WOS:000485090400087		
J	Wheeler, J.C.								Thermonuclear detonations and deflagrations in supernovae								AIP Conference Proceedings					208			34	42						1990	1990	A certain class of exploding stars, supernovae, is thought to arise in dense stellar cores supported by the degeneracy pressure of electrons and composed of roughly equal mass fractions of carbon and oxygen. These conditions are very volatile. Under appropriate conditions, the thermonuclear ignition of carbon occurs. The nuclear burning is very sensitive to the temperature (propT20), but the electron degeneracy pressure does not respond to the resulting increase in thermal energy content, so there is no mechanical response of the star which would ordinarily serve to regulate the burning by adiabatic expansion and cooling. The result is a rapid runaway with the burning proceeding to completion. The star finally responds mechanically and explodes. The nature of the resulting runaway is controversial. The reason is that the thermonuclear energy is released rapidly but the resulting overpressure is modest compared to the high electron degeneracy pressure. Some models predict a subsonic deflagration preceded by the shock initiated in the initial isochoric burning. The nature of the propagation of the deflagration by turbulent interchange of heat is poorly understood and crudely modeled. In some parametrizations, the resulting model explosion ejects matter that is only partially consumed by nuclear reactions, and the resulting composition is in fair agreement with observations. Other calculations have revealed, however, that under fairly general conditions the initial runaway results in the spontaneous burning of a small but finite mass for which the time scale for nuclear burning is smaller than the sound crossing time.					17th International Symposium on Shock Waves and Shock Tubes17th International Symposium on Shock Waves and Shock Tubes	17 July 198917 July 1989		Bethlehem, PA, USABethlehem, PA, USA	0	0	0		0	0	0			0094-243X			INSPEC:3834373

The protective layer is expected to (1) be stable against reaction with photogenerated holes, (2) prevent direct contact of the unstable semiconductor with the electrolyte, and (3) prevent the migration of ions through the semiconductor/electrolyte interface, while still allowing photogenerated carriers to transport to the interface and participate in the desired redox reactions. Zinc oxide (ZnO) is an attractive photocatalyst material due to its high absorption coefficient and high carrier mobilities. However, ZnO is chemically unstable and undergoes photocorrosion, which limits its use in applications such as in photoelectrochemical cells for water splitting or photocatalytic water purification. This article describes an investigation of the band alignment, electrochemical properties, and interfacial structure of ZnO coated with Al2O3 and SiO2 ALD layers. The interface electronic properties were determined using in situ X-ray and UV photoemission spectroscopy, and the photochemical response and stability under voltage bias were determined using linear sweep voltammetry and chronoamperometry. The resulting surface structure and degradation processes were identified using atomic force, scanning electron, and transmission electron microscopy. The suite of characterization tools enable the failure mechanisms to be more clearly discerned. The results show that the rapid photocorrosion of ZnO thin films is only slightly slowed by use of an Al2O3 ALD coating. A 4 nm SiO2 layer proved to be more effective, but its protection capability could be affected by the diffusion of ions from the electrolyte.									21	2	0	0	4	0	21			1944-8244			WOS:000401782500025	28441470

We found Phe a in a Chl d-dominant cyanobacterium Acaryochloris marina, whereas Phe d was absent. The minimum Chl a:Phe a ratio was 2:2, indicating that the primary electron donor is Chl a, accessory is Chl d, and the primary electron acceptor is Phe a in PS II of A. marina.

Here, time-resolved X-ray total scattering and transmission electron microscopy characterization are used to study the formation of palladium-platinum core-shell nanoparticles under solvothermal conditions. It is shown that Pd rapidly forms small (5-10 nm), disordered primary particles, which agglomerate and crystallize when reaching 20-25 nm. The primary Pd particles provide nucleation sites for Pt, and, with extended reaction time, the Pd cores become fully covered with Pt shells. The observed core-shell material is surprising when considering the Pt-Pd phase diagram and relative surface energies, but it can be rationalized through the kinetics of precursor conversion. To bridge the gap between scientific studies and industrial demand for large-scale production, the synthesis process is successfully transferred to a continuous flow supercritical reactor providing a simple scalable and green process for production of bimetallic nanocatalysts.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			1616-301X	1616-3028		WOS:000477977100020

Herein, a versatile approach is demonstrated to skilfully synthesize Co2P nanoparticles encapsulated in nitrogen doped hollow carbon rods (Co2P/N-HCRs) by ball-milling following simple heat treatment. In particular, the Co/C content has an extremely important influence on the formation of Co2P/N-HCRs with tubular structures. Benefiting from structural advantages and synergistic effects between Co2P and the protective N-doped graphitic carbon shell, the optimal Co2P/N-HCRs display comparable electrocatalytic activity and excellent durability relative to a commercial Pt/C catalyst. Apart from providing a promising electrocatalyst alternative, this work, most importantly, holds great potential for a high-yielding yet cost-effective manufacturing strategy to prepare metal phosphide/N-C electrocatalysts for renewable electrochemical energy technologies.									45	2	0	0	2	0	46			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000408267300046

Well-developed hematite nanotube arrays perpendicular to the substrate with a 1 mu m in length have been obtained. The nanoporous sample was characterized by pores of a mean diameter of 30 nm and an interpore distance of 150 nm, whereas the self-organized nanotube layer consisted of nanotube arrays with a single tube inner diameter of approximately 50 nm and average spacing of approximately 90 nm. The wall thickness of the hematite nanotubes was of approximately 30 nm. A comparative study of the photoelectrochemical properties of these two different hematite nanostructures under water-splitting conditions have been studied through EIS and PEIS methods. The strong correlation between the C-SS increase with the R-SS,R-ct decrease and the photocurrent development as the potential is made more anodic, indicated that holes transfer for the water splitting reaction takes place through the surface states and not directly from valence band holes. From the PEIS spectra the rate constants of the elementary reactions responsible for the competing processes of interfacial charge transfer (k(tr)) and electron-hole recombination (k(rec)) have been determined. A better photoresponse kinetic was observed from the hematite nanotubular structure as compared to the nanoporous one. The last indicates that in the hematite nanotubular structure it exists a very well length scale matching between the nanotube wall thickness and the hole diffusion length (maximize light absorption while maintaining the bulk within hole collection length), diminishing then the recombination processes.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			1533-4880	1533-4899		WOS:000402487200012

Mesoporous materials offer opportunities in energy conversion and storage applications owing to their extraordinarily high surface areas and large pore volumes. These properties may improve the performance of materials in terms of energy and power density, lifetime and stability. In this Review, we summarize the primary methods for preparing mesoporous materials and discuss their applications as electrodes and/or catalysts in solar cells, solar fuel production, rechargeable batteries, supercapacitors and fuel cells. Finally, we outline the research and development challenges of mesoporous materials that need to be overcome to increase their contribution in renewable energy applications.									1184	72	0	0	78	0	1203			2058-8437			WOS:000377672200002

Evaluation of Tolerance of Some Elemental Impurities on Performance of Pb-Ca-Sn Positive Pole Grids of Lead-Acid Batteries								JOURNAL OF ELECTROCHEMICAL SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY				3	3			123	134		10.5229/JECST.2012.3.3.123				SEP 30 2012	2012	The electrochemical performance of positive pole grids of lead-acid batteries made of Pb-0.08%Ca-1.1% Sn alloys without and with 0.1 wt% of each of Cu, As or Sb and with 0.1 wt% of Cu, As and Sb combined was investigated by electrochemical methods in 4.0 M H2SO4. The corrodibility of alloys under open-circuit conditions and constant current charging of the positive pole, the positive pole gassing and the self-discharge of the charged positive pole were studied. All impurities (Cu, As, Sb) were found to decrease the corrosion resistance, R-corr after 1/2 hour corrosion, but after 24 hours an improvement in R-corr was recorded for Sb containing alloy and the alloy with the three impurities combined. While an individual impurity was found to enhance oxygen evolution reaction, the impurities combined significantly inhibition this reaction and the related water loss problem was improved. Impedance results were found helpful in identification of the species involved in the charging/discharging and the self-discharge of the positive pole. Impurities individually or combined were found to increase the self-discharge during polarization (33-68%), where Sb containing alloy was the worst and impurities combined alloy was the least. The corrosion of the positive pole grid in the constant current charging was found to increase in the presence of impurities by 5-10%. Under open-circuit, the self-discharge of the charged positive grids was found to increase significantly (92-212%) in the presence of impurities, with Sb-containing alloy was the worst. The important result of the study is that the harmful effect of the studied impurities combined was not additive but sometimes lesser than any individual impurity.									1	1	0	0	0	0	1			2093-8551			WOS:000209009100003

Recently, more and more abnormal cases have been found that cannot be explained by the conventional simplified models. In this work, the strain effects in five late TMs, Fe, Co, Ni, Pd, and Pt are studied in-depth regarding the facet engineering, the surface atom density, and the d-band center. Interestingly, the irregular response of Fe lattice to the applied strain is identified, indicating the untapped potential of achieving the phase change by precise strain modulation. For the complicated high-index facets, the surface atom density has become the pivotal factor in determining the surface stability and electroactivity, which identifies the potential of high entropy alloys (HEA) in electrocatalysis. The work supplies insightful understanding and significant references for future research in subtle modulation of electroactivity based on the precise facet engineering in the more complex facets and morphologies.									7	3	0	0	1	0	9			1613-6810	1613-6829		WOS:000560659100001	32815291

A multimodal nature of characterization, including in situ or operando X-ray, electron, light spectroscopies, and steady state reactivity measurements demonstrated critical information on the temporal evolution of the catalyst active sites including key measurements performed in operando conditions using synchrotron techniques (EXAFS and XANES). In situ DRIFT spectroscopy allowed decoupling of the aldol condensation and dehydrogenation reactive steps due to the promotion with enhanced ability to carry out aldol condensation, as correlated with the steady state reactivity experiments. In situ UV-vis spectroscopy presented a complex picture of the adsorbates with pi-pi(*) electronic transitions due to the allylic cations, cyclic or aromatic species while also suggesting oligomeric CuO species were formed. Operando X-ray measurements combined with ab initio multiple scattering modeling performed as a function of temperature identified a transient intermediate assigned to a 4-fold coordinate Cu species that was key leading to increase in Cu-Cu pair number. We identified two types of Zn pairs, namely Zn-O and Zn-Mg, during X-ray analysis under operating conditions. With Zn nearly 6-coordinated when in the vicinity of Mg while Zn-O species coordinated to nearly 4 nearest neighbors. The data suggest that such supported catalyst deactivation might proceed not only via carbon coking mechanism but also through the dispersed Cu site diffusion and growth due to the nearest neighbor oxygen atoms loss. The results presented suggest intermediates for segregation/deactivation mechanisms for a broader set of supported Cu and Zn catalysts used for alcohol upgrading catalytic reactions.									24	0	0	0	3	0	24			2155-5435			WOS:000455286600030

By that, the HEA films (HEAFs) were formed by phase formation via short-range and fast diffusion processes. Multilayers with a total thickness of 760 nm consisting of 16 repetitions of a Cu (11 nm)/CrNiO (16.5 nm)/CoFe (20 nm) sequence were annealed at temperatures from 600 degrees C to 1000 degrees C for 5 min. The reaction products were then analyzed by means of X-ray diffraction (XRD) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) combined with electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS), in order to identify the phase transformations and elemental distributions. A duplex FCC structure containing CrCoFeNiO HEA and pure Cu phase was successfully synthesized at 600 degrees C and 800 degrees C by the solidstate reaction. CuCrCoFeNiO HEA formed within in a Cu nanocrystalline matrix. As the annealing temperature increased, the oxygen content in the films decreased, Both HEA and Cu possess significant < 111 > preferred orientation. The HEA phase demonstrated a typical microstructure of alloys with intensive nano-twins. Moreover, the grain growth kinetics of the HEA phase was evaluated, and the activation energy was found to be 185 (10) kJ/mol. This is comparable to that of conventional stainless steel (similar to 150 kJ/mol) and less than half of the value for CrCoFeNi bulk (434 kJ/mol). A surface energy-driven grain growth mechanism of the HEAFs via multilayer alloy formation is proposed in this study. The mechanical properties, hardness and Young's modulus, were measured via nanoindentation, and the strengthening mechanism was proposed and compared with current literature.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0257-8972			WOS:000604583200045

In this article, we present a first and complete study on composition dependence of Ni-Co hydroxides and oxides for methanol electro-oxidation. Ni-Co hydroxide electrodes were prepared by co-electrodeposition on stainless steel mesh (SSM). The atomic ratio of Ni/ Ni + Co in Ni-Co hydroxides was controlled by adjusting the ratio of precursor concentration. Ni-Co oxide electrodes were further obtained by annealing the Ni-Co hydroxides. The morphology factors of Ni-Co hydroxides and oxides were revealed by measuring double layer capacitance using cyclic voltammetry (CV). Methanol oxidation reaction (MOR) performance of these Ni-Co hydroxides and oxide electrodes was investigated by CV, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) techniques at room temperature (RT, similar to 25 degrees C). It is found that the MOR performance of Ni-Co hydroxides increased with the increase of Ni content, while the performance of Ni-Co oxide electrodes presented a volcano plot. The highest MOR performance, the smallest charge transfer resistance and Tafel slope were found at the atomic composition of 46% Ni. Such an enhancement probably was due to the synergistic effect of coexisting Ni and Co in the spinel structure. In contrast, the electrode with the mixture of Ni oxide and Co oxide was unable to reach such a high activity. The function of Ni in Ni-Co hydroxides and oxides was attributed to facilitating the methanol oxidation, and in low potential it presented high absorption of intermediate products.

This is the first work introducing a promising energy efficient technology using Ti4O7 anode reactive electrochemical membrane (REM) coupled with permonosulfate (PMS) to address HA-enriched wastewater. The removal performance, possible generation of reactive species along with reaction mechanisms in PMS/REM system were proposed and compared with the traditional REM system. Regardless of electrical potential, chlorine concentration, water flux and PMS dosage (with similar ionic strength by adding SO(4)(2-)for REM alone), the hybrid PMS/ REM system prevails the REM system alone in terms of HA degradation and energy efficiency. However, the extent of removal performance is also largely dependent upon specific condition. An increase in PMS dosage and anode electrical potential was beneficial for HA degradation, but addition of chloride imposed adverse effects on HA removal efficiency. Of those parameters, the influence of water flux on HA degradation was trivial. Compared to REM alone, in which HA was mostly removed via electrosorption, PMS/REM system, otherwise, significantly enhanced mineralization of HA. The electron paramagnetic resonance experiments demonstrated the absence of sulfate radical (SO4 center dot-) in the PMS/REM system and implied that the more efficient performance of the hybrid system over the REM system was likely ascribed to the higher yield of hydroxyl radical (center dot & nbsp;OH). Besides, non-radical oxidation also played an important role in the PMS/REM system with the formation of a transition state of PMS molecule (PMS*), which could facilitate center dot & nbsp;OH production by inhibiting oxygen evolution site reactions.									7	0	0	0	3	0	7			1383-5866	1873-3794		WOS:000788164200006

Although it has several advantages (suitable band gap around 2.4 eV, suitable valence-band position for water oxidation, low toxicity, high abundance), it suffers from slow charge-carrier transport properties, high surface recombination, and limited water-oxidation activity. In the present work, we review the synthesis and doping strategies that we developed in the last years to improve the PEC performance of BiVO4 photoanodes. Strategies ranging from single anion doping or cation doping to anion and cation co-doping will be presented for fluoride and molybdenum as anion and cation dopants, respectively. One major result is that co-doping allows combining the most important PEC specific benefits of each type of dopant, i.e. an increased charge-injection efficiency in case of fluoride as well as an increased charge-separation efficiency in case of molybdenum.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			0942-9352			WOS:000528279600007

Under basic conditions, the C-bound phenyl group readily cyclometalates, while under acidic conditions, cyclometalation is reversed. The sensitivity of the C-aryl-Ir bond but not the C-trz-Ir bond towards acidolysis provided a basis for using 2 as a catalyst in Ce-IV-mediated water oxidation. The catalytic activity is characterized by a robust catalytic cycle, affording excellent turnover numbers (TON > 20 000). Under cerium-free conditions and in the presence of hematite as a photoelectrode, light-induced activity was observed. The photoelectrochemical reaction is strongly pH-dependent, which requires pH adjustments when running multiple cycle experiments to regenerate the catalytic activity. Analogous chelating complexes display better stability and higher catalytic activity than the monodentate complex 2.									91	0	0	0	6	0	91			1477-9226	1477-9234		WOS:000309615200008	23007162

Thus, the choice of water electrolysis is the finest way of producing clean and greener hydrogen energy as an alternative fuel source for future. Hence, it is necessary to develop electrocatalyst which will have high activity, stability and cost effectivity for overall water splitting. Besides, to replace the high-cost noble metals with various transition metals based nanomaterials (NMs) for total water splitting (TWS) is the eventual objective to make the H-2 production towards the industrial level. In this line, the recent literature examination gives the clear notion that the transition metal hydroxides (TMOHs) are superior activity towards TWS reactions with low overpotential. But the effects of metal combinations with simple metal hydroxides on their catalytic performance are stagnant towards bi-functional system in the alkaline water electrolysis. This review details the significance of such combinations (mono, bi-, tri-, tetra-metal hydroxides) and their synergistic effect for the first time. The nature of TM hydroxides and their influence in TWS is not explored as a review before and we strongly believed which is extremely important at the current energy scenario in the globe. So in this review we addressed the potentiality of these TM hydroxides and their analogues for real scale studies for the first time. In-addition, this review also highlights how the overpotential values can be reduced with chalcogenides and phosphides substituted TMOHs as a bi-functional catalyst for TWS. Overall, the investigation on these systems can pave a way for researchers to examine further with TM hydroxides in terms of structure, activity and stability in TWS study in future.									8	0	0	0	0	0	8			2398-4902			WOS:000720485600001

In this study, the hydrolytic weakening mechanisms of crystal alpha-quartz and amorphous silica glass were investigated in light of molecular simulation. A reactive force field was used to simulate the structure, dynamics and mechanical properties of the silica with water molecules during a uniaxial tensile process with loading rates from 0.02 to 0.16 ps(-1). Dry silica samples, obtained by the temperature quenching method, and wet silica samples, formed by Grand Canonical Monte Carlo water adsorption, were prepared for mechanical tests. Structurally, water penetrating the silica cavity can form H-bonds with the neighboring bridging oxygen in the silicate network, leading to the elongation of the Si-O bonds and the enlargement of the Si-O-Si angles. Dynamically, the confined water molecules, with a high diffusion rate, collide with the silicate network, reducing the stability of the siloxane bonds. The reactive force field, coupled with the chemical and mechanical responses, provides new insights into the molecular structural evolution. During the tensile process, the siloxane bonds and Si-O-Si angles are initially stretched in the elastic region. Subsequently, the silica network depolymerizes into branch structures and, finally, the structure undergoes a tensioned fracture in a catastrophic manner. When the stress exceeds 30% of the tensile strength, water molecules in the silica system begin to dissociate into two reaction pathways, i.e. one governed by the chemical adsorption of water at a low stress level and the other dominated by the breakage of siloxane bonds at a high stress level. The stress-dependent water dissociation accelerates the depolymerization of the silica network, and brings about further irreversible deformation, which weakens the cohesive force of the silica.

However, rational design over these photocatalysts is still a challenging task because the detailed mechanism of multi-component catalysts is not well understood yet. Here, we highlight a state-of-the-art approach, one-step flame spray pyrolysis (FSP), for preparing high-efficiency hybrid CuOx/TiO2 photocatalysts, where simultaneous control over lattice doping and nanocluster modification of Cu species on a TiO2 support is achieved. Effective engineering of Cu valence is achieved, where the surface Cu+ content varies from 15% to as high as 100%. Meanwhile, a high percentage (70-80 mol%) of TiO2 photocatalytic active phase (anatase) is also maintained in the flame-made catalysts. A dramatic enhancement in photocatalytic H-2 evolution efficiency of the hybrid catalyst is attained. The maximum photocatalytic H-2 evolution rate of the hybrid CuOx/TiO2 catalyst under Xe lamp in a methanol aqueous solution can reach as high as 112.6 mu mol h(-1), which is approximate to 22.1 times higher than that of commercial P25 TiO2. Mechanism investigation via density functional theory calculation and photoluminescence spectra validates that the bulk defect levels and surface-deposited CuOx nanoclusters play key roles in charge separation and extending spectral response.									18	0	0	0	1	0	18			2367-198X			WOS:000452302800012		
J	SAMUILOV, VD; BARSKY, EL								INTERACTION OF CARBONYL CYANIDE M-CHLOROPHENYLHYDRAZONE WITH THE PHOTOSYSTEM-II ACCEPTOR SIDE								FEBS LETTERS				320	2			118	120		10.1016/0014-5793(93)80074-5				APR 5 1993	1993	We show that CCCP, known as an uncoupler of photophosphorylation and an ADRY agent, inhibits FeCy photoreduction and coupled O2 evolution by isolated chloroplasts equally (I50 approximately 2 muM), but is practically without effect on the O2 evolution coupled with SiMo reduction within the 0.2-10 muM concentration range. CCCP has no effect on the nanosecond chlorophyll fluorescence in chloroplasts incubated at low light intensity, but decreases it at high light intensity. The electron transfer from reduced TMPD or duroquinol to methylviologen is resistant to CCCP. The efficiency of the CCCP inhibitory action on the FeCy photoreduction depends on the rate of electron flow, which is controlled by the light intensity. The data obtained show that CCCP is oxidized by the photosystem II donor side and is reduced by Q(p) competing for electrons with FeCy and the cytochrome b/f complex.									11	2	1	0	9	0	13			0014-5793			WOS:A1993KV46400007	8458426

Interface engineering has been demonstrated to be critical for developing high-performance photoelectrodes for efficient water splitting. However, effective interface engineering requires insightful understanding of the interfacial thermodynamics, carrier dynamics, and surface reaction mechanisms, all of which essentially depend on the advances of study techniques. Herein, electrochemical and optical spectroscopic techniques applied for interface studies in PEC systems are overviewed. The fundamentals and data analysis methods of each technique are introduced, in company with representative achievements in understanding the PEC interfaces. Both conventional and newly developed techniques are included, with some discussions on their advantages and limitations. Finally, a perspective on the challenges and the future progress of techniques for PEC interface studies is also given. This review could inspire further technique development and a mechanistic understanding of PEC water splitting.									25	0	0	0	0	0	25			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000526936600001

Vacancies, as typical atomic defects or imperfections that widely exist in solid materials, are demonstrated to effectively modulate the physicochemical, electronic, and catalytic properties of nanomaterials, which is a key concept and hot research topic in nanochemistry and nanocatalysis. The recent experimental and theoretical progresses achieved in the preparation and application of vacancy-rich nanocatalysts for electrochemical water splitting are explored. Engineering of vacancies has shown to open up a new avenue beyond the traditional morphology, size, and composition modifications for the development of nonprecious electrocatalysts toward efficient energy conversion. First, an introduction followed by discussions of different types of vacancies, the approaches to create vacancies, and the advanced techniques widely used to characterize these vacancies are presented. Importantly, the correlations between the vacancies and activities of the vacancy-rich electrocatalysts via tuning the electronic states, active sites, and kinetic energy barriers are reviewed. Finally, perspectives on the existing challenges along with some opportunities for the further development of vacancy-rich noble metal-free electrocatalysts with high performance are discussed.									217	13	0	0	8	0	218			1613-6810	1613-6829		WOS:000430186600003	29356413

Ag3PO4 is a highly efficient visible light photocatalyst for dye degradation and water oxidation to O-2, with a higher OER rate than BiVO4 and WO3. Despite extensive studies on Ag3PO4, the surface properties including surface electronic states, reaction sites and mechanisms of OER on Ag3PO4 surfaces are not clear at present. Herein, we reported a comparative first-principles density functional theory study of the bulk, surface properties and the mechanism of OER on the three primary low index facets of Ag3PO4: (100), (110) and (111). We revealed for the first time that the rate-limiting step of the OER on Ag3PO4 (100), (110) and (111) surfaces is the dehydrogenation of HO* (HO* -> O* + H+ + e -), which is different from most reported metal oxides and nitrides like TiO2 and g-C3N4. The OER process on the (100) surface tends to proceed by following a different mechanism as that on the (110) and (111) surfaces. The illumination of the Ag3PO4 (100), (110), and (111) surfaces with solar light provides enough overpotential for the OER to proceed spontaneously. In particular, the free energy change of removal of the first proton from water on the Ag3PO4 (111) surface is much lower than that on (100) and (110) surfaces, giving an explanation for the experimentally observed higher catalytic activity of the (111) surface. The exposed phosphorus atoms on the Ag3PO4 (111) surface promote the dehydrogenation of H2O and suppress the formation of mid-gap states. Our results are profound for understanding the underlying mechanism of the photocatalytic water oxidation process occurring on Ag3PO4 surfaces, and serve as a foundation for developing new highperformance Ag3PO4 based photocatalysts for water splitting and organic contaminant decomposition.									10	0	0	0	2	0	10				2046-2069		WOS:000401525500012

It is demonstrated that kinetic evaporation of solar composition material can produce residues of calcium-, aluminum-rich inclusion bulk chemistry. The evaporation sequence of the main constituents in this solar composition material is iron > silicon approximate to magnesium > titanium, Calcium and aluminum remain unevaporated after evaporation of 95% of the solar composition material. The chemical fractionation between the gas and condensed phase is a function not only of temperature and pressure, but also of the hulk chemical composition of the condensed phase. During the evaporation process, cerium is almost as volatile as iron. The 2,000-fold cerium depletion found in some refractory inclusions in carbonaceous chondrites was reproduced in the evaporation experiment and can be readily explained as a result of evaporation of preexisting meteoritic material. Kinetic isotopic fractionation of magnesium, oxygen, and silicon follows the Rayleigh distillation law during the laboratory evaporation of synthetic solar composition material. This implies that the residue is well mixed during the evaporation process and that the evaporation kinetic processes (both chemical and isotopic) are surface reaction-controlled. The isotopic mass fractionation factors are lower than those predicted from theoretical calculations by using the square root of mass ratios of likely evaporating species. Thus, the surface reaction is more complicated than decomposition into single gas species of each element.

The popular bi-functional catalysts usually shown good activity for one half reaction at expense of the activity for another half-reaction, thus given a moderate performance for overall water splitting. In this paper, we have reported on integrating the active OER (Ni3N) and HER (NiMoN) components as Ni3N-NiMoN heterostructures for the effective overall water splitting. The heterostructures were constructed by the controllable nitridation of the Ni-Mo-O precursor anchored on carbon cloth (CC) under NH3 atmosphere. The micro-structures of the catalyst could be tuned by regulating the surface properties of CC and the calcination temperature. Under optimized condition, the Ni3N-NiMoN catalysts exhibited good catalytic activity for both OER and HER in alkaline electrolyte. The catalysts can achieve a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at an over-potential of 31 mV for HER, being close to Pt catalyst. Also, it only requiring an overpotential of 277 mV to reach current density of 10 mA cm(-2) for OER. Moreover, the cell assembled by the identical Ni3N-NiMoN as both the cathode and anode needs only a cell voltage of 1.54 V to achieve current density of 10 mA cm(-2). The superior performance of Ni3(N)-NiMoN heterostructures can be ascribed to the following points: 1) the simultaneous presence of active OER and HER components and the promoted action each other in the heterostructures, and 2) the exposure of the abundant active sites in the sheet-like structure assembled by the nanoparticles.									358	20	0	0	9	0	365			2211-2855	2211-3282		WOS:000419833900041

However, our understanding of the adaptive strategies that enable symbiotic organisms to expand their habitats is still fragmentary. Here, we report that a single-ribotype endosymbiont population in an individual of the host vent mussel, Bathymodiolus septemdierum has heterogeneous genomes with regard to the composition of key metabolic gene clusters for hydrogen oxidation and nitrate reduction. The host individual harbours heterogeneous symbiont subpopulations that either possess or lack the gene clusters encoding hydrogenase or nitrate reductase. The proportions of the different symbiont subpopulations in a host appeared to vary with the environment or with the host's development. Furthermore, the symbiont subpopulations were distributed in patches to form a mosaic pattern in the gill. Genomic heterogeneity in an endosymbiont population may enable differential utilization of diverse substrates and confer metabolic flexibility. Our findings open a new chapter in our understanding of how symbiotic organisms alter their metabolic capabilities and expand their range of habitats.									43	3	0	0	41	0	46			1751-7362	1751-7370		WOS:000372364000018	26418631

Supported electrocatalysts produced by a novel method for thermal spray deposition were investigated with respect to their structural properties, elemental composition, and electrochemical performance. This was done using electron microscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and cyclic voltammetry. Various shapes and sizes of catalyst particles were found. The materials exhibit different activity towards oxidation and reduction of Fe. The results show that this preparation method enables the selection of particle coverage as well as size and shape of the catalyst material. Due to the great variability of support and catalyst materials accessible with this technique, this approach is a useful extension to other preparation methods for electrocatalysts.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0				1996-1944		WOS:000552487500001	32560385

Potentiodynamic polarization curve, potentiostatic polarization curve, immersion test and surface analysis technique were adopted to investigate the corrosion behavior systematically. The potentiodynamic polarization curves showed that with the increase of AC current density, the corrosion current density of X100 steel with different microstructures also increased. The cathode controlled by the oxygen-consuming reaction was dominated by hydrogen evolution reaction gradually. Under the interference of alternating current, the corrosion rate of annealed structure, hot-rolled structure and normalized structure was descending. In the potentiostatic polarization test, the annealed structure was more obviously affected by AC interference. The corrosion morphology of X100 steel with different microstructures was mainly local corrosion and there were different degrees of pitting. In addition, the number of corrosion pits in the annealed structure was more and the size was bigger and deeper. Pitting was mostly distributed at the grain boundary of pearlite and ferrite, and a few were distributed inside the pearlite. However, the normalized structure had less number of pitting corrosion and the size was smaller. The hot-rolled microstructure had more granular bainite which was diffusely distributed, and more small pits were distributed in the area where granular bainite aggregated. The X100 pipeline steel with different microstructures has different corrosion resistance. The micro-galvanic corrosion caused by pearlite and ferrite is more serious under AC interference, so the annealed structure has the worst corrosion resistance, while the M/A island in the normalized structure is needle-like and the number of granular bainite is less, so the corrosion resistance is the best. The corrosion resistance of the hot rolled structure is between that of annealed structure and normalized structure.			目的使用不同组织X100钢模拟焊接接头,探究在格尔木土壤模拟环境下,交流干扰对X100管线钢焊接接头腐蚀行为的影响规律。方法采用动电位极化曲线、恒电位极化曲线、浸泡实验及表面分析技术,对X100管线钢焊接接头的腐蚀行为进行系统研究。结果动电位极化曲线表明,随着交流电流密度的增加,不同组织X100钢腐蚀电流密度呈增加的趋势,阴极由耗氧反应控制转变为由析氢反应主导。在交流干扰下,腐蚀速率V退火>V热轧>V正火,恒电位极化测试中,退火组织受到交流干扰的影响更为明显。不同组织X100钢腐蚀形态以局部腐蚀为主,且有不同程度的点蚀发生。退火组织的腐蚀坑数量多,尺寸大而深,点蚀多分布在珠光体与铁素体的晶界处,少数分布在珠光体内部;正火组织点蚀数量最少,尺寸最小;热轧组织中粒状贝氏体较多且呈弥散分布,有较多的小点蚀分布在粒状贝氏体聚集的区域。结论不同组织X100管线钢因微观结构不同而导致其耐蚀性有所差异。交流干扰下,由于珠光体与铁素体组织形成的微电偶腐蚀较为严重,从而导致退火组织的耐腐蚀性最差;正火组织中M/A岛呈针状分布,粒状贝氏体相对较少,耐腐蚀性最好;热轧组织的耐蚀性居于退火组织与正火组织两者之间。						0	2	0	0	0	0	2			1001-3660			CSCD:6567600

To combat this effect efforts have been made to increase the interaction between the metal nanoparticles and the support using materials like silica. In this study, the supported metal particles were covered with a highly porous layer of silica to stabilize the Co nanoparticles on a titania support both during reduction and under reaction conditions. Co3O4 nanoparticles (size range: 8-12 nm) supported on titania were stabilized by coating them with a thin layer of mesoporous silica (similar to 4 nm) to make Fischer-Tropsch catalysts that are less prone to sintering (Co/TiO2@mSiO(2)). To mitigate the strong metal support interactions brought about by the titania and silica a Ru promoter was loaded together with the cobalt nanoparticles onto the titania (CoRu/TiO2@mSiO(2)). Temperature programmed XRD studies on the evolution of the Co metal nanoparticles showed that there was no significant particle size growth under reduction conditions in the temperature range from 30 to 600 degrees C. Chemisorption studies following reduction under hydrogen at 350 degrees C and 450 degrees C gave results consistent with the in situ XRD data when compared to the Co/TiO2. Fischer-Tropsch synthesis on the Co/TiO2@mSiO(2) and CoRu/TiO2@mSiO(2) catalysts encapsulated inside the mesoporous silica shell exhibited good catalytic performance without any display of significant mass transport limitations that might arise due to a silica shell coating of the active sites. For these two catalysts the Fischer-Tropsch activity increased with reduction temperature without any significant negative changes in their selectivity due to sintering, while the activity on Co/TiO2 decreased due to Co nanoparticle sintering.									20	1	0	0	0	0	21			0926-860X	1873-3875		WOS:000425073500014

O-2 evolution rates (H2O --> DCBQ; 2,6-dichloro-p-benzoquinone) of A251D, A251L and A251S were lower, being 38, 16, 62 and 70%, respectively, of that of the control, and there was an even more drastic impairment of O-2 evolution when measured from H2O to DMBQ (2,5-dimethyl-p-benzoquinone), demonstrating modifications in the Q(B) pocket. However, in all other mutants but A251K, the Q(B) function could sustain O-2 evolution at a level high enough to support photosynthetic growth. The mutant A251S, carrying a substitution of alanine for a chemically quite similar residue serine, was less severely affected. Substitution by a positively charged residue drastically delayed chlorophyll a fluorescence relaxation in the non-photosynthetic strain A251K, implying strong impairment of Q(A)-to-Q(B) electron transfer. Delay of fluorescence relaxation was clear in A251D as well, carrying a substitution of alanine for a negatively charged residue. The effects of the substitutions of A251 demonstrate the importance of this residue of the D1 polypeptide in the conformation of the acceptor side of PS II and, accordingly, the effect on the acceptor-side function of PS II was very clear. Nevertheless, the tolerance of PS II activity to high-light-induced photoinhibition in vivo and the subsequent D1 degradation were not much impaired in any of the photosynthetic mutant strains as compared to the control.									4	0	0	0	4	0	4			0167-4412	1573-5028		WOS:000077762100027	9869424

Herein, we report a facile synthesis of CuO microspheres composed of ultrathin, single-crystal-like nanosheets via a simple solution method. The as-obtained CuO microspheres can serve as an active and stable water oxidation catalyst under electrochemical reaction conditions, owing to their unique structural features. In electrochemical water oxidation, this catalyst affords a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) (a value related to practical relevance) at an overpotential of similar to 0.48 V. Pure CuO was reported as a water oxidation catalyst (WOC) from near-neutral conditions to alkalescent conditions. Electrochemistry values agree with the Nernstian behavior, suggesting ne(-)/nH(+) transfer prior to a chemical rate-determining step.

Kumar Bera, Melinda/0000-0002-8909-0684			Origin of graphite, and temperature of metamorphism in Precambrian Eastern Ghats Mobile Belt, Orissa, India: A carbon isotope approach								JOURNAL OF ASIAN EARTH SCIENCES				36	2-3			252	260		10.1016/j.jseaes.2009.06.008				SEP 20 2009	2009	The carbon isotope composition of graphite and carbon and oxygen isotope composition of associated calcite from different locations of the Eastern Ghats Mobile Belt (EGMB) of Orissa have been measured in order to understand the origin of graphite. The delta C-13 values of graphite range from -2.4 parts per thousand to --26.6 parts per thousand. Forty-four of sixty-one samples have delta C-13 values less than -20 parts per thousand. Most of these low delta C-13 values graphite corresponds to schists and disseminations in khondalite and calc-silicate granulites, thus indicating graphitization of organic matter. The remaining light-carbon-graphite occurs as veins which is the result of graphitization of transported organic matter. The graphite with intermediate delta C-13 value (- 13 parts per thousand to - 19 parts per thousand) indicates carbon contributions from both organic and carbonates sources and/or mantle sources. The higher delta C-13 values graphite (-2.4 parts per thousand to -8.8 parts per thousand) represent mantle carbon and/or carbonate sources without significant contribution from organic carbon.The temperatures of metamorphism have been estimated using carbon isotope ratios of graphite and associated calcite of calc-silicate granulites, where typical cation exchange thermometer assemblages are lacking and significant mineral reaction textures used to calculate pressure-temperature of metamorphic events are absent. Metamorphic temperatures obtained 945 degrees C are close to the ultrahigh-temperature reported from the EGMB. The minimum temperature estimated using the graphite-carbonate carbon isotope ratio is 90 degrees C. The lower estimates of temperatures probably indicate changes in the carbon isotope ratio of calcite by decarbonation reaction or armoring of carbonaceous matter in silicates during metamorphism preventing continuous exchange with calcite.

The most favorable route for these rearrangements in dichloromethane solution is a two-step mechanism involving as the first step the coordination of the gold(I) complex to the alkyne moiety with subsequent evolution through a 1,2-alkyl shift. Activation of the reactive C-C bonds takes place mainly through hyperconjugative interactions of these bonds with the oxygen atom and the alkyne moiety; this latter interaction is reinforced by the presence of the cationic gold(I) complex. The second step is the rate-determining one and consists of a 1,4-H shift, which requires the assistance by a second molecule of cyclopropanol to become readily accessible. This second molecule plays a very efficient bifunctional catalytic role, which cannot be played by a dichloromethane molecule. The use of methanol, water, and HFIP as assisting molecules was also investigated. Calculations suggest that the process would run most favorably in water. In agreement with experimental data, we found that the most favorable ring expansion of 3 takes place through migration of the substituted carbon atom. The only product to be expected from the rearrangement of 4, however, is that corresponding to the migration of the nonsubstituted carbon atom. ((c) Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

J	Geng, Jingjuan; Li, Jinhu; Yang, Yongliang; Li, Zenghua; Peng, Wei								Kinetic Analysis of the Generation of Active Sites During the Low-Temperature Pyrolysis of Coal								COMBUSTION SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY											10.1080/00102202.2022.2079377		MAY 2022			2022	Decomposition of oxygen-containing functional groups simultaneously produces CO and CO2, accompanied by the generation of active sites. Two different methods were applied in the study to speculate the kinetics of gas generation and the formation of active sites in coal pyrolysis. The evolution of CO and CO2 gas generation during isothermal pyrolysis under different temperatures was first analyzed, and the generation of CO and CO2 in the pyrolysis process was divided into three stages: the rapid decline stage, slow decline stage, and stabilization stage. In the early stage of the pyrolysis reaction, functional groups exhibited a rapid decomposition rate and a high conversion rate (a), which rapidly decreased the gas concentrations. With increasing pyrolysis time, the decomposition of functional groups declined with a low conversion rate (a) and showed a steady reaction rate in the later stage. On this basis, a method to calculate the activation energy during pyrolysis based on the data of gases generated in a steady period with a continuous cooling temperature was proposed. Activation energies of 70.12-148.39 kJ/mol for the CO formation and 64.47-127.38 kJ/mol for the CO2 formation were obtained from four different coals. In addition, a thermogravimetric analyzer was used to explore the apparent activation energies in the decomposition process via Coats-Redfern (C-R) method; activation energies of 39.33-126.65 kJ/mol and pre-exponential factors of 1.31-5.15E+08 s(-1) were obtained for different coals. The results revealed that the CO had a greater generation activation energy than CO2, and a higher metamorphism degree implies a higher decomposition activation energy, which indicates that the decomposition of carboxyl groups and low-rank coals result in higher active sites.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0010-2202	1563-521X		WOS:000800491400001

In situ and in operando studies by means of electrochemical scanning probe microscopy (EC-SPM) have become indispensable experimental tools due to their capability of resolving surface topography down to the atomic level even within the harsh environment of electrolytes. EC-SPM methodologies have thus contributed tremendously to the current understanding of electrocatalysis. In this review article, recent achievements in complementary EC-SPM techniques, namely electrochemical scanning tunneling microscopy (EC-STM), electrochemical atomic force microscopy (EC-AFM), scanning electrochemical potential microscopy (SECPM), and scanning electrochemical microscopy (SECM), are discussed with particular focus on electrochemical phenomena important for the field of electrocatalysis. The currently available options for obtaining insight on local chemical composition and local reactivity as well as important electrocatalytic model systems are considered. In addition, the application of EC-SPM methods to metal ion batteries is addressed.									21	2	0	0	1	0	22			2366-9608			WOS:000484495900011

Since the passivation rate and intensity are dependent on the deposit morphology, herein, we focus on the mechanisms governing Li2O2 formation within the porous cathode. We report evidence of homogeneous nucleation of Li2O2 crystallites and their further assembly in bulk of the electrolyte solution in DMSO, which possesses a high donor number. After careful estimation of the superoxide ion concentration distribution within a phenomenological model, it was found that the high stability of superoxide ions formed during the ORR towards disproportionation and sufficient diffusivity of (0.5-1.2) x 10(-6) cm(2) s(-1) enabled Li2O2 nucleation and crystallization not only at the surface but also in the electrolyte, and the reaction zone spread throughout the internal space of the porous electrode. High initial supersaturation promoted the homogeneous nucleation of Li2O2 nanoplates, which instantly assembled into mesocrystals also in the solution bulk. These results were supported by operando SAXS/WAXS and morphology observations. Thus, although homogeneous nucleation is not dominant, it is important for achieving a high capacity in Li-O-2 batteries.									11	0	0	0	0	0	11			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000531408100036	32043506

In this study, the selective electrocatalytic hydrogenation of NB to aniline (AN) was studied using multi-elemental oxides (Fe0.3Co0.05Ni0.05Cu0.3Zn0.2)O, synthesized via urea hydrolysis method and heat-treated at different temperatures (300-1000 C). The synthetic route chosen allowed the obtention of multi-phase materials and high entropy oxide (HEO) conditions, to be used as electrocatalysts, and to evaluate the effect of the crystal structure on the catalytic performance. The catalysts were characterized using physical methods scanning electron microscopy, energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, and X-ray diffraction. The electrochemical properties were evaluated using cyclic voltammetry, linear sweep voltammetry, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, and chronoamperometry. The polycrystalline structure obtained at 500 C (HEO500) showed the highest selectivity (above 45%), while the more crystalline catalyst (HEO800) exhibited the highest conversion (30%) and kinetic constant (k = 9.4 x 10-3 s-1). The catalytic performance of the materials demonstrated a strong correlation with the microstructure and surface properties, like crystallite size, initial crystal phase, oxygen vacancies concentration, and redox properties. All the HEO materials exhibited a better catalytic performance than the commercial benchmark, Pt/C 5% wt catalyst, which showed no selectivity towards aniline and low conversion in 1.0 M KOH solution at-1.4 V vs Ag/AgCl. This improvement was attributed to the increase in the surface concentration of hydrogen found on the HEOs. These results highlight the importance of the surface defects on the activity and selectivity of multi-step surface-dependent catalytic hydrogenation reactions; and provide fundamental information on the importance of carefully choosing the synthesis and calcination conditions.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0013-4686	1873-3859		WOS:000848143700002

Topological compounds were screened based on band gap, band edge energy, and thermodynamics stability criteria. In addition, topological types for our final candidates were computed based on electronic structures calculated usingthe hybrid density functional theory including exact Hartree-Fock exchange. Our final list contains materials which have band gaps between 1.0 and 2.7 eV in addition to band edge energies suitable for water oxidation and reduction. However, the topological types of these compounds calculated with the hybrid functional differ from those reported previously. To that end, we discuss the importance of computational methods for the calculation of atomic and electronic structures in materials screening processes.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0				2515-7639		WOS:000721058500001

We report the synthesis of Rh-Rh2O3 nanoparticles/nitrogen-doped carbon composite (Rh-Rh2O3-NPs/C) for HER/HOR applications. The HER activity of this catalyst is approximate to 2.2 times and 1.43 times better than that of commercial Pt/C in base and acid, respectively. Rh-Rh2O3-NPs/C exhibited 10 mA cm(-2) current density at an overpotential of 63 mV and 13 mV with Tafel slopes of 70 mV dec(-1) and 32 mV dec(-1) in base and acid, respectively. The catalyst showed superior HOR activity at all pH values. The exchange current densities were approximate to 0.425 mA cm(Rh)(-2) and approximate to 0.43 mA cm(Rh)(-2) in base and acid, respectively. In base, the HOR and HER activities of Rh-Rh2O3-NPs/C are 50-fold and 10-fold higher, respectively, in comparison with those of the Rh2O3-free RhNPs/C catalyst, although the HER/HOR activity of both the catalysts is comparable in acid. In base, the adsorption of OH- species (OHads) on Rh2O3 sites increases the reactivity of hydrogen intermediate (H-abs), which leads to the enhancement of HOR activity of Rh-Rh2O3-NPs/C. For HER in base, the adsorptive dissociation of water occurs on the Rh2O3 sites to form H-ads on the neighboring Rh sites and then, the recombination of H-ads results in the formation of hydrogen molecules. This study may provide an opportunity to develop an efficient catalyst for hydrogen-based renewable energy technologies.									69	3	0	0	2	0	71			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000451813300033

The morphology of Li2O2 impacts strongly on the electrochemical performance of Li-O-2 cells in terms of energy efficiency and rate capability. Crystalline Li2O2 is readily available and its properties have been studied in depth for Li-O-2 batteries. However, little is known about the amorphous Li2O2 because of its rarity in high purity. Herein, amorphous Li2O2 has been synthesized by a rapid reaction of tetramethylammonium superoxide and LiClO4 in solution, and its amorphous nature has been confirmed by a range of techniques. Compared with its crystalline siblings, amorphous Li2O2 demonstrates enhanced charge-transport properties and increased electro-oxidation kinetics, manifesting itself a desirable discharge phase for high-performance Li-O-2 batteries.									103	2	0	0	8	0	103			1433-7851	1521-3773		WOS:000383473600033	27486085

The role of metal oxides in these devices has been diverse, from charge transport layers to catalytic surfaces to protective blocking layers. Understanding the fundamental structural and electronic properties of these materials will continue to allow for advancement in the field of renewable energy. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) is one of the most utilized methods to characterize these electrodes in the context of energy applications. The utility of EIS stems from its ability to differentiate multiple interfaces (i.e., solid/electrolyte, solid/solid) within devices on the basis of their frequency response to a modulated potential and the subsequent decoupling of resistive and capacitive circuit components. In this review, the fundamental theory of EIS is first described with a physical and mathematical basis, followed by a discussion of equivalent circuit modeling. The review then covers examples from the literature where EIS has been particularly important in the understanding of electronic properties related to metal oxide electrodes within energy conversion and storage devices. A specific focus is placed on metal oxides that are used as heterojunction solar cells, ion batteries, and photocatalysts/electrocatalysts. Common themes are discussed within each application such as the study of electron and hole diffusion in solar cells, the dependence of recombination reactions and catalysis on surface defect/trap states for solar cells and photocatalysts, and the formation of passivation layers at the solid electrolyte interface in Li-ion batteries.									266	3	0	0	14	0	265			2574-0962			WOS:000510104700009

As expected in oceanic environments, most of the sampled rocks are lizardite-chrysotile serpentinites exhibiting a variety of pseudomorphic through non-pseudomorphic textures, such textural evolution probably being related to changing water/rock ratios during this retrograde process. Oxygen isotope temperatures indicate that the serpentinization took place at 300-200 degrees C; on the other hand, isotopic data suggest that replacement of early pseudomorphic lizardite by lizardite chrysotile non-pseudomorphic textures requires that temperatures and/or water/rock ratios are high enough to promote the necessary dissolution-recrystallization processes. Mass-balance calculations for olivine-serpentine and orthopyroxene-serpentine pairs provided a basis for establishing serpentinization reactions likely to have produced the present rocks. Moreover, these calculations also showed that, notwithstanding some noticeable loss of MgO from olivine and of SiO2 from orthopyroxene, serpentinization of both minerals implies volume increases on the order of 26-27%, therefore potentially promoting the overall expansion of the rock. The geochemical and isotopic features of the studied rocks indicate that unmodified seawater was responsible for the serpentinization of the MAR peridotites. However, the mineralogy and REE patterns of some of these serpentinites indicate occasional subsequent interaction of the scrpentinized rocks with seawater at much lower temperatures (seafloor alteration, characterized by carbonate deposition and negative Ce anomalies), or with high-temperature ore-forming hydrothermal fluids (ore-forming alteration, characterized by sulfide precipitation and steep positive Eu anomalies).									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0008-4476	1499-1276		WOS:000489108600007

For in situ environmental transmission electron microscopy (ETEM) studies, this requires preparation of electron transparent ultrathin TEM lamella without surface damage. Here, thin films of Pr1-xCaxMnO3 (PCMO, x = 0.1, 0.33) and La1-xSrxMnO3 (LSMO, x = 0.4) perovskites are used to demonstrate a cross-section specimen preparation method, comprised of two steps. The first step is based on optimized focused ion beam cutting procedures using a photoresist protection layer, finally being removed by plasma-etching. The second step is applicable for materials susceptible to surface amorphization, where in situ recrystallization back to perovskite structure is achieved by using electron beam driven chemistry in gases. This requires reduction of residual water vapor in a TEM column. Depending on the gas environment, long crystalline facets having different atomic terminations and Mn-valence state, can be prepared.									6	0	0	0	1	0	6				2073-4344		WOS:000489178000053

At first, stabilization of electrons in BiVO4 by grafting Fe3+ was confirmed by analyzing the formation of O-2(-) and H2O2 as reduction intermediates of O-2. When BiVO4 was co-grafted with Fe3+ and CoPi as an electron separator and a hole separator, respectively, its photocatalytic activity for decomposition of gaseous acetaldehyde with visible light (470 nm LED) was enhanced compared to the BiVO4 grafted only by either co-catalyst. This indicated that co-grafting is effective to increase photocatalytic activity because electron and hole were effectively taken out of the BiVO4. Furthermore, by combined with CuBi2O4, a p-type semiconductor, the photocatalytic activity of BiVO4 was also increased. This is because holes and electrons, which were generated in the both semiconductors, were successfully separated in BiVO4 and CuBi2O4, respectively, due to combination of electrons in the BiVO4 with holes in the CuBi2O4. To promote the reaction between electrons in BiVO4 and holes in CuBi2O4, we examined co-grafting effects of two kinds of co-catalyst to the composite by preparing the Cu/CuBi2O4-CoPi/BiVO4 photocatalyst. The photocatalytic activity was further enhanced when it was prepared in a suitable procedure that enables us to graft the reduction and oxidation co-catalysts only at each site.

The graphite/beta-PbO2 anode was prepared by anodic deposition method and the electrocatalytic properties of lead oxide film were studied by FESEM, XRD, EDX-mapping, linear sweep voltammetry and accelerated lifetime test techniques. The effect of five independent variables including pH, Na2SO4 concentration, current density, GAC amount, and reaction time on the system response was optimized by an orthogonal central composite-genetic algorithm (OCCD-GA). The results showed that beta-PbO2 crystals were deposited as completely compact pyramidal clusters on the graphite surface. In addition, the service life and oxygen evolution potential (OEP) for the electrocatalytic layer of beta-PbO2 were 90 h and 2 V, respectively. Based on the developed quadratic model (R-2 > 0.99 and p-value < 0.0001), the optimal points for pH, Na2SO4 concentration, current density, GAC amount, and reaction time were predicted to be 4.6, 0.074 mol L-1, 35.7 mA cm(-2), 25 g, and 80 min, respectively. Under optimal conditions, BPA removal efficiency in 3DER system and separate application of electrocatalytic degradation and GAC were obtained 98.8%, 72.2% and 9.75%, respectively. Thus, the electrocatalytic synergy of 3DER system due to lead oxide layer and GAC particle electrodes in BPA degradation was calculated to be 35.5%. LC-MS analysis was used to identity the intermediates formed during BPA degradation. The final degradation intermediates were short-chain acids including adipic acid, malonic acid and, acetic acid.									35	0	0	0	7	0	35			2213-2929	2213-3437		WOS:000703570300003

They are involved in hydroxylation reactions, in biological and atmospheric phenomena. A recent application of these radicals is their use in decontamination of water polluted by toxic organic substances like pesticides, Chemically, these radicals are produced by the use of a mixture of (H2O2 + Fe2+), the so called Fenton's reagent. In this work Fenton's reagent is generated by electrochemistry in a catalytic way, The reaction of the hydroxyl radicals with pentachlorophenol (PCP) was studied. These radicals generated in situ in aqueous solution react with PCP and thus lead to its degradation. The evolution of the composition of the solution was followed by chromatographic analysis, COD analysis and the measurement of the total organic carbon (TOC) of the studied aqueous solution. Tetrachloro-o-benzoquinone and tetrachloro-p-benzoquinone (TCBQ) are the only aromatic intermediates identified. They result from the oxidation of the corresponding tetrachlorohydroquinones (TCHQ). Just like PCP, the TCBQs, are degraded and disappear in their turn. The mineralization of the initial toxic substrate is confirmed on the one hand, by the regular decrease in quantity of the total organic carbon of the solution (TOC analysis) and on the other hand, by the quantitative release of chloride ions according to the electrical charge passed during electrolysis. The degradation of PCP appears relatively slow compared to that of the other organic pollutants studied by the electro-Fenton process and also to the degradation of other less substituted chlorophenols. The kinetic rate of the appearance of chloride ions is slower than that in the degradation of PCP. This phenomenon highlights the formation of chlorated aliphatic intermediates.

This method is applied for the first time to photoexcited trivalent clusters generated in an evaporative ensemble and the experimental data cover a size range that was not explored in previous pioneering experiments on their dynamics. Small clusters dissociate through the loss of a neutral or a charged atom whereas clusters larger than a well defined critical size merely dissociate through the first channel. In the framework of the RRK statistical theory, the measured evaporation rates provide some information about the size evolution of the cluster dissociation energies and their ionization potentials in the low size range. The competition between the ion and the atom evaporation is found to be consistent with the size evolution of the ionization potentials independently measured by direct photoionization. The agreement between theory and experiment is discussed in relation to cluster structure, especially in the case of gallium.

Herein, the synthesis of hexagonal rosettes of g-C3N4 with an efficient performance toward hydrogen evolution and hydrogen peroxide production as the two kinds of solar fuels were reported. The hexagonal rosettes of g-C3N4 were simply fabricated via controlled solid-state polymerization of three-dimensional hexagonal rosettes of cyanuric acid-melamine adduct at 500 degrees C. The hexagonal rosettes of g-C3N4 showed an amorphous nature with an extremely high surface area of 400 m(2) g(-1). Also, the as-obtained catalyst demonstrated remarkable photocatalytic activity in hydrogen production of 1285 mu mol g(-1) h(-1) and hydrogen peroxide production of 150 lmol g(-1) h(-1). The mechanism for the polymerization process of the cyanuric acid-melamine (CM) complex to hexagonal rosettes of g-C3N4 was thoroughly described employing electron microscopy tools. This study identified that the CM complex condensation is accomplished via a dehydration process by producing a highly condensed and active structure of g-C3N4, which is different from the previously reported condensation mechanism of the melamine and its derivatives performed through a deamination process.

An efficient PEC process is rooted in appropriate semiconductor materials, which should possess small bandgap to ensure wide light harvest, facile charge separation to allow the generated photocharges migrating to the reactive sites and highly catalytic capability to fully utilize the separated photocharges. Proper electrode fabrication method is of equal importance for promoting charge transfer and accelerating surface reactions in the electrodes. Moreover, powerful characterization method can shed light on the complex PEC process and provide deep understanding of the rate-determining step for us to improve the PEC systems further. Targeting on high solar conversion efficiency, here we provide a review on the development of PEC water splitting in the aspect of materials exploring, fabrication method and characterization. It is expected to provide some fundamental insight of PEC and inspire the design of more effective PEC systems.									38	10	0	0	1	0	38			2095-8226	2199-4501		WOS:000432687500003

Nevertheless, the poor electrical conductivity and narrow micropores of MOFs have constrained their applications. Hence, MOF composites, in which MOFs are combined with a variety of functional materials, have been introduced to mitigate the disadvantages of individual components. Zero-dimensional materials such as nanoparticles and quantum dots, one-dimensional materials (nanorods, nanotubes and nanobelts), and two-dimensional nanosheet materials can be combined with MOFs, and three-dimensional MOF composites have also been reported, including core-shell and cubic composites. In this review, the recent development of MOF composites and their synthetic methods, and their electrochemical applications, including catalysts, sensors, supercapacitors and batteries, are discussed according to their dimensions.									198	11	0	0	22	0	204			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000463819400001

Semiconductor oxides like Fe2O3 and BiVO4 have been gaining significant attention as promising materials. However, they exhibit a major drawback of a large required overpotential for solar water oxidation. In this Perspective, recent efforts to characterize and reduce the overpotential are critically examined The accumulation of photogenerated holes at the semiconductor-liquid interface, recently observed with multiple techniques, is rationalized with surface state models. Transient absorption spectroscopy and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy suggest that surface treatments designed to either passivate surface traps or increase reaction rates (as catalysts) actually perform identically. This calls into question the definition of a catalyst when coupled to a semiconductor photoelectrode. In contrast, results from transient photocurrent spectroscopy suggest that two separate loss mechanisms are indeed occurring and can be addressed separately.									249	7	0	0	11	1	251			1948-7185			WOS:000321793800008	26282969	
J	Bratzdrum, Christian; Grapes, Rodney; Giere, Reto					Giere, Reto/0000-0001-8507-1956			Late-stage hydrothermal alteration and heteromorphism of calc-alkaline lamprophyre dykes in Late Jurassic Granite, Southeast China								LITHOS				113	3-4			820	830		10.1016/j.lithos.2009.07.008				DEC 2009	2009	Three generations of calc-alkaline lamprophyre, occurring as patches or segregations in granite and as dyke swarms with a NNW-SSE trend, are associated with the Late Jurassic Shanqi-Xiaqi granite, SE China. They comprise coarse-grained, hornblende-dominated spessartite and two types of panidiomorphic kersantite: type-1 contains clinopyroxene and biotite phenocrysts, whereas type-2 is fine-grained and plagioclase-rich. The granite is characterised by large feldspar crystals and Al-rich annite. This rare occurrence of outcrops with no influence from atmospheric weathering allows the investigation of extensive alteration from hydrothermal interaction between lamprophyres and granite. At a depth of ca. 18 km, the breakdown of annite in the granite to magnetite+K-feldspar was the result of reheating above 670 degrees C at oxygen activities N10-17 bar. In the lamprophyres, a variety of reactions due to autometasomatism include: breakdown of Ti-rich pargasites to chlorite, epidote, titanite; olivine to talc, tremolite, saponite, beidellite and Fe-Cr spinels; biotite to chlorite and titanite; calcic plagioclase to orthoclase, albite, epidote, chlorite and beidellite. Late-stage magmatic hydrothermal fluids from granite and lamprophyres resulted in redistribution of F, Ba, Sr, and CO(2) with the formation of calcite-fluorite veins. Amphibole-rich spessartite and biotite-diopside dominated kersantite exhibit heteromorphism in that they have similar geochemical characteristics but different mineralogies. The alkali-rich lamprophyric magmas are inferred to have been derived from melting in the mantle wedge during the subduction of the Kula Plate, and show typical backarc rift chemistry. Prior to intrusion of lamprophyre, underplating of large volumes of basaltic magma is thought to have enhanced partial melting in the overlying continental crust resulting in widespread granite magmatism in SE China.

These autoliths consist of two different rock types: augite syenite and naujaite (agpaitic nepheline syenite). All three rock types show a number of alteration features related to the entrapment of the autoliths in the kakortokite magma caused by the interaction with a fluid phase.In the kakortokites, the oxidation of primary arfvedsonite to aegirine and fluorite is restricted to the close proximity to the autoliths. Close to the surrounding kakortokite, the primary mafic phases of the augite syenites (augite, fayalite, Fe-Ti oxides) are completely replaced by arfvedsonite, aenigmatite, biotite, aegirine and fluorite. The decomposition of primary hastingsite to spectacular aegirine-augite-nepheline-aenigmatite symplectites can be observed up to several meters inside the autoliths. Additionally, fluorite formed at grain boundaries of primary nepheline. In the naujaite autoliths, primary arfvedsonite is replaced by aegirine-biotite intergrowths and abundant aenigmatite is occasionally replaced by Ti-rich aegirine and Fe-Ti oxides.The mineral reactions in the autoliths are used to decipher details of the late to post-magmatic processes in a peralkaline syenitic intrusion. Mineral equilibria record an evolution governed by falling temperature (620 to ca. 500 degrees C) and increasing relative oxygen fugacity from FMQ+1 to above FMQ+4. Quantification of the observed mineral reactions reveals the infiltration of the autoliths with an oxidizing fluid phase rich in Na and F and minor addition of K. Volatiles (H and F) and in some cases also Fe, Ti and Ca (+/- Mg) released from primary autolith phases were mainly just relocated within the autoliths.

In HIE, the brain undergoes primary and secondary energy failure phases separated by a latent phase in which partial neuronal recovery is observed. A hypoxic-ischemic event leads to oxygen restriction causing ATP depletion, neuronal oxidative stress, and cell death. Mitochondrial dysfunction and enhanced oxidant formation in brain cells are characteristic phenomena associated with energy failure.Recent Advances: Mitochondrial sources of oxidants in neurons include complex I of the mitochondrial respiratory chain, as a key contributor to O-2(center dot-) production via succinate by a reverse electron transport mechanism. The reaction of O-2(center dot-) with nitric oxide ((NO)-N-center dot) yields peroxynitrite, a mitochondrial and cellular toxin. Quantitation of the redox state of cytochrome c oxidase, through broadband near-infrared spectroscopy, represents a promising monitoring approach to evaluate mitochondrial dysfunction in vivo in humans, in conjunction with the determination of cerebral oxygenation and their correlation with the severity of brain injury.Critical Issues: The energetic failure being a key phenomenon in HIE connected with the severity of the encephalopathy, measurement of mitochondrial dysfunction in vivo provides an approach to assess evolution, prognosis, and adequate therapies. Restoration of mitochondrial redox homeostasis constitutes a key therapeutic goal.Future Directions: While hypothermia is the only currently accepted therapy in clinical management to preserve mitochondrial function, other mitochondria-targeted and/or redox-based treatments are likely to synergize to ensure further efficacy.									13	1	0	0	6	0	14			1523-0864	1557-7716		WOS:000539516300001	32295425

Herein, Ni doped Co3S4 hierarchical nanosheets on Ti mesh (Ni doped Co3S4 HNS/TM) were successfully prepared by using metal organic framework (MOF) as precursor which was synthesized under ambient condition. Characterization results confirmed this structure and Ni incorporation into Co3S4 lattice as well as the modified electronic structure of Co3S4 by Ni doping. Alkaline HER performance showed that Ni doped Co3S4 HNS/TM presented outstanding HER activity with 173 mV overpotential at -10 mA.cm(-2), surpassing most of metal sulfide-based electrocatalysts. The hierarchical structure, superior electrical conductivity and electronic structure modulation contributed to the accelerated water dissociation and enhanced intrinsic activity. This work provides a new avenue for synthesizing hierarchical nanostructure and simultaneously tuning the electronic structure to promote HER performance, which has potential application in designing highly efficient and cost-effective HER nanostructured electrocatalyst.

Compound 2 shows a 3-nodal (5,6,11)-connected 3D framework with a point symbol of {410}{414 center dot 6}{4(34)center dot 6(21)}. Compound 3 features a (4,8)-connected 3D network built from a binuclear La cluster with a point symbol of {4(16)center dot 6(12)}{4(4)center dot 6(2)}(2).

In addition, almost all the MOFs display significant fluorescence quenching behaviors by the addition of various nitro-aromatic compounds (NACs), especially TNP. More importantly, six new MOFs have been further investigated to evaluate their electrocatalytic activities for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). The results demonstrate that all the MOFs exhibit improved performance compared to ligand H4TCPP for the HER with the lowest onset overpotential of 244 mV and the smallest Tafel slope of 248 mV dec(-1), respectively.									16	0	0	0	0	0	16			1466-8033			WOS:000457296300011

However, the performance of these co-catalysts assistant TiO2 photocatalysts is still not sufficient enough due to their relatively weak visible-light absorption. Herein, we report a simple impregnation treatment with ferric ethoxide/ethanol solvent, followed with mild heating which can significantly enhance the visible-light absorption and photocatalytic activity of TiO2. XPS and EPR analyses manifest that the oxygen vacancies (V(O)s) and Fe-species are simultaneously introduced to the surface of TiO2. The chemical state and photocatalytic activity of the Fe-species-grafted TiO2-x is dependent on the heating temperature after impregnation. The sample heat-treated at 250 degrees C exhibits the optimal photocatalytic performance for beta-naphthol degradation with rate constant 6.0, 2.7, and 3.9 times higher than that of TiO2, TiO2-x, and Fe-TiO2, respectively. The activity enhancement is discussed on the basis of the synergistic effect and energy-level matching of surface VOs and Fe-species co-catalyst, i.e. the VOs defects states increase the visible-light absorption and the Fe-species in the form of FeOOH promote the consumption of photo-generated electrons through multi-electron reduction of adsorbed molecule oxygen.

The potential of FTO for the O-2 evolution reaction - determined by linear scan voltammetry - was equal to 2.1 V vs. the SHE, high enough to form hydroxyl radicals ((OH)-O-center dot) through anodic oxidation (AO). By letting UVA light shine through the glass reactor coated with an optimal TiO2 loading of 0.311 mg cm(-2), heterogeneous photocatalysis occurred, which led to a second source of cOH. Coupled with a three-dimensional (3D) carbonaceous cathode and with the addition of a catalytic amount of Fe2+, four more sources of cOH could be implemented through H2O2 electroactivation, the Fenton reaction, H2O2 photolysis and Fe(III)-hydroxy complex photolysis. This combined photoelectrocatalytic Fenton process allowed reaching a phenol (chosen as a model pollutant to allow for easy comparison with other processes) degradation rate of 0.0168 min(-1) and a mineralization yield of 97% after 8 h of treatment, far better than those of each individual process. Notably, the phenol degradation rate of the combined process was 37% higher than that of electro-Fenton (EF) alone and 42% higher than that of AO alone. A synergy was observed (with a photocatalytic synergy value of SPC = 1.26) in the presence of TiO2, which improved on UV photolysis alone (UV synergy value, SUV = 0.97) and could be further augmented in a novel 3D-printed flow-cell reactor, designed to maximize the distance of electrode separation and the contact between gaseous O-2 and the carbon cathode. Indeed, UVA radiation shining through the FTO anode - with a transmissivity of 65% - improved the kinetics of photolytic reactions as compared to dark processes, with a synergy value (SUV) as high as 1.87. Thanks to these enhancements, the overall phenol degradation rate could be further increased to 0.0175 min(-1), 14% higher than that within the stirred glass reactor (0.0153 min(-1)).

The loading of ZnO played a determinant role in the enhancement of the photocatalytic activity, being 3% the optimal amount. The heterostructures exhibited suitable photocatalytic activity and stability under UV light. The catalytic activity of CuFe2O4-ZnO 3% was 1.3 times higher than the activity of CuFe2O4, while the performance of NiFe2O4-ZnO3% was 1.6 times higher than NiFe2O4. This improvement in the activity was attributed to an appropriate coupling of the electronic bands of the semiconductors to form the heterostructure, allowing enhanced charge transference in the interface of the semiconductors and a reduction in the recombination, which lead to a higher photocatalytic activity.									19	1	0	0	3	0	19			1010-6030			WOS:000447567000050

The unique properties of HEA-based electrocatalysts may arise from the synergy of the mixed elements in a single-phase solid solution. Unfortunately, the details regarding the active catalytic sites and intrinsic activity of such catalysts are still very vague since the focused investigation on the properties of HEA NPs has only started recently. In this report, the progress of development of HEA NPs is critically reviewed to determine the extent of potential of HEA-based electrocatalysts. Herein, we present the proposed thermodynamic models that guide the design of HEA single-phase solid solution, followed by the discussion of different synthetic strategies to fabricate HEA NPs. Computational studies and machine-learning assisted tools are also presented to find the optimum catalyst composition and structure of HEA NPs, which is necessary to further improve the catalytic performance of HEA-based electrocatalysts and to gauge the relevance of structural factors such as strain effects, adsorption energies, and the interparticle distance to the catalytic performance. We conclude this report by drawing attention to future research directions on HEA NPs.									60	4	0	0	4	0	60			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000555361700001

Density functional calculations have been carried out to explore the reaction mechanism and the origin of selectivity. The porphyrin ligand was found to be redox noninnocent and accept two electrons and one proton, while the ferrous ion keeps its oxidation state as +2 during the reduction. The Fe-II-porphyrin diradical intermediate then performs a nucleophilic attack on CO2, coupled with two electron transfers from the porphyrin ligand to the CO2 moiety. Subsequently, an intramolecular proton transfer takes place from the porphyrin nitrogen to the carboxylate oxygen, affording an Fe-II-COOH intermediate. An alternative pathway to form the critical Fe-II-COOH intermediate, involving the attack on CO2 by an unprotonated two-electron reduced Fe-II-porphyrin diradical species followed by protonation, was found to be possible as well. Finally, proton transfer from the carbonic acid in the aqueous solution to the hydroxyl moiety results in the cleavage of the C-O bond and the production of a CO molecule. The formation of an Fe-II-hydride species, a critical intermediate for the production of H-2 and formic acid, was found to be kinetically much less favorable than the protonation of the porphyrin nitrogen, even though it is thermodynamically more favorable. The prevention of this metal-hydride formation pathway explains why this catalyst is highly selective for the reduction of CO2 in aqueous solution.									18	1	0	0	0	0	18			2155-5435			WOS:000538766900038

They have been investigated as promising electrode materials to achieve high energy density. In this study, NiO/NiCo2O4/Co3O4 composite with high specific surface and mesoporous structure is fabricated by a sol-gel process then calcined at 250 degrees C. Benefits from the improved electron conductivity and effective mesoporous structure, the fabricated composite exhibits high specific capacitance (1717 F g(-1)), enhanced rate capability, and excellent electrochemical stability (94.9% retention after 1000 cycles). Interestingly, the specific capacitance of the composite is higher than that of NiO, NiCo2O4, and Co3O4, which indicates a synergistic effect of the composite on improvement of electrochemical performance. The findings demonstrate the importance and great potential of NiO/NiCo2O4/Co3O4 composite in development of high-performance energy-storage systems.									182	13	0	0	6	0	188			1944-8244			WOS:000309099800029	22924644

To determine optimal conditions, the effects of some experimental parameters (initial pH, initial H2O2 concentration, temperature, and organics load) on the UV/H2O2 process efficiency in terms of absorbance at 330 and 281 nm and chemical oxygen demand (COD) and total organic carbon (TOC) removals were studied. The results show that the UV/H2O2 system leads successfully to the almost-complete elimination of absorbance at 330 and 281 rim, COD, and TOC from an actual PPMW containing 270 mg of C L-1 under natural pH (pH 11.25) using 2.1 g of H2O2 L-1 at 28 degrees C. Under these optimal conditions, pseudo-first-order kinetics was determined for absorbance at 330 and 281 nm and COD decay with rate constants of 0.029, 0.02, and 0.008 min(-1), respectively. Furthermore, the evolution with time of the H2O2 concentration exhibits two parts: a linear decrease to 300 min and then exponential change until the end of the treatment. This shows that the kinetics of H2O2 disappearance changes during the treatment from a pseudo-zeroth-order reaction in the first steps to a pseudo-first-order reaction in the final steps. On the other hand, a continuous decrease of pH and a rapid total phenols disappearance were observed during UV/H2O2 treatment of PPMW. These results suggest that several steps are involved in the photochemical oxidation of organics, starting with degradation of lignin derivatives and tannins to obtain aromatic intermediates that then undergo oxidative ring opening, leading to aliphatic carboxylic acids. In the final steps, carboxylic acids are mineralized into CO2 and H2O.									36	3	0	0	12	0	39			0888-5885			WOS:000264569300015

In the presence of water, the main reaction product is the alkoxy phenylacetamide, due to a nucleophylic attack of acetonitrile to the aromatic ring, followed by hydrolysis. In anhydrous medium, the main reaction product is a polymer, which is formed following an ECE type of mechanism. This polymer forms a bilayer structure on the electrode surface and is insoluble, stable and good conductor of electricity. It is coloured and shows electrochromic properties, and some of them are sensitive to temperature, pressure, light radiation and sound frequency. They can modify electrodes and can be modified by metallic particles. Some of these modified materials have been used as electrodes for the reduction process of carbon dioxide and electrolytic oxygen evolution. Preparation of these polymers in different media, modified morphology and properties of the material.

Although enormous effort has been devoted to photocatalysts, the sunlight still cannot be fully utilized by the developed photocatalysts. It is important but remains challenging to develop a broad spectrum-driven photocatalyst for overall water splitting. Here, we design a UV-Vis-NIR broad spectrum-driven carbon dots modified WO2-NaxWO3 (WO2-NaxWO3-CDs) composite as photocatalyst for overall water splitting without requirement of any sacrificial agents or cocatalysts. When the concentration of CDs in the sample is 0.008 g(CDs)/g(catalyst), the WO2-NaxWO3-CDs shows the highest photocatalytic activity with stoichiometric ratio of H-2/O-2 evolutions and their rates are 0.05/0.02, 2.58/1.24, 4.74/2.28 mu mol/h under UV (lambda < 420 nm), visible (420 nm <= lambda <= 760 nm) and near-infrared (lambda > 760 nm) light irradiation, respectively. It is also impressive that the photocatalyst shows excellent stability for about 6 cycles of repetitive experiments. The WO2-NaxWO3-CDs composites functioned as broad spectrum-driven photocatalyst for overall water splitting should attribute to the synergistic effect of WO2-NaxWO3 and CDs, in which the WO2-NaxWO3 provides the suitable bandgap, while the CDs can enhance light absorption and accelerate separation efficiencies of photo-generated charge carriers.									7	2	0	0	1	0	9			0920-5861	1873-4308		WOS:000491876500019

Oxygen spillover, metal support interactions (MSIs) and charge transfer are among many mechanisms observed and proposed as to how NP-support interfaces assist and enhance catalysis. This work studies the migration of oxygen across the Pd NP-CuO nanowire (NW) interface and beyond. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and Kelvin probe force microscopy (KPFM) found an interaction between the Pd NP and CuO NW support, via the formation of PdO at the Pd-CuO interface. It was found, through in situ irradiation at high vacuum transmission electron microscopy (TEM), that oxygen enters the Pd NP lattice from the Pd-CuO interface via amorphization of the NP. Varying the amount of irradiation highlighted the different rates of amorphization of NPs, with full amorphization of a NP leading to the formation of an epitaxially driven PdO across the NPs. Interestingly, in situ heating in XPS observed a reduction to metallic Pd, found to be similarly amorphous during TEM investigation. On comparison with Pd supported on a non-reducible substrate - in which oxidation was found to proceed from the outer surface in, rather than the support interface (resulting in a PdO shell) it is theorized that the oxidation and reduction of Pd on CuO forms a PdO NP surface full of Pd-PdO sites allowing for synergistic effects, of great use in the oxidation and hydrogenation of organic species.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			1463-9076	1463-9084		WOS:000612961700028	33432935

The electron spin echo amplitude of the g = 2 ''multiline'' signal varies inversely with temperature over this range, indicating a ground spin state Curie law behavior in agreement with our previously reported work [Britt et al. (1992) Biochim. Biophys. Acta 1140, 95-101]. Results of a plot of the natural log of the electron spin-lattice relaxation rate versus reciprocal temperature are consistent with an Orbach mechanism serving as the dominant relaxation pathway for the ''multiline'' signal in this temperature range. The slope of the plot indicates that an excited spin state manifold exists 36.5 cm(-1) above the groundstate manifold that gives rise to the ''multiline'' signal.									49	0	0	0	22	0	49			0006-2960			WOS:A1994PL35800009	7918427

In this work we designed and synthesized a series of four copper(II) porphyrin complexes (4-, 3-, 2- and 1-Cu) where the molecular conformations are modulated by a pair of stepwise shortened straps on the same porphyrin side (cis-ortho) to give double bow-shaped skeletons. Single crystal structures demonstrate that the straps gradually increase the saddle deformation and the deviation of the metal centers, which is in accordance with two, unusual d-orbital reconstructions of two different ground states, as revealed by 4 K EPR and DFT calculations. In the study of the electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), 1-Cu, with the shortest straps, showed the most apparent improvement of activity. Second coordination sphere (SCS) effects created by the double bow-shaped architecture and the strong saddle porphyrin core in 1-Cu are found to play key roles in proton trapping during the catalytic process. The work contributes a novel strategy to improve the catalytic performance of heme analogs through ligand geometric modulation.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			0947-6539	1521-3765		WOS:000737627200001	34981568

However, these optimistic expectations are frustrated by the still inadequate understanding of the fundamentals of the electrochemical/chemical reactions occurring at the cathode side, as well as within the electrolyte and at the threephase interface. In this work, we illustrate the evolution of the morphology and composition of a carbonaceous cathode in the first discharge/charge in a Li-O-2 cell with an ether-based electrolyte by X-ray photoemission spectroscopy, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, and transmission electron microscopy. Experiments have been carried out ex situ on electrodes recuperated from electrochemical cells stopped at various stages of galvanostatic discharge and charge. Apparently, a reversible accumulation and decomposition of organic and inorganic precipitates occurs upon discharge and charge, respectively. These precipitations and decompositions are likely driven by electrochemical and chemical parasitic processes due to the reactivity of the cathode carbonaceous matrix.									25	0	0	0	2	0	25			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000362628900019	26375042

Comparison of catalysts showed that ZnO is the most efficient for catalyzing the removal of carbofuran and their main organic intermediates.

The primary degradation of carbofuran followed pseudo-first order kinetics.

The main aim of the study was to determine the role of cerium in the amelioration of magnesium deficiency effects in CO2 assimilation of spinach. Spinach plants were cultivated in Hoagland's solution. They were subjected to magnesium deficiency and to cerium chloride administered in the magnesium-present Hoagland's media and magnesium-deficient Hoagland's media. The results showed that the chlorophyll synthesis and oxygen evolution was destroyed, and the activities of Rubisco carboxylasae and Rubisco activase and the expression of Rubisco large subunit (rbcL), Rubisco small subunit (rbcS), and Rubisco activase subunit (rca) were significantly inhibited, then plant growth was inhibited by magnesium deficiency. However, cerium promotes the chlorophyll synthesis, the activities of two key enzymes in CO2 assimilation, and the expression of rbcL, rbcS, and rca, thus leading to the enhancement of spinach growth under magnesium-deficient conditions.									32	3	0	0	24	0	34			0163-4984	1559-0720		WOS:000270323100006	19274447

In this study, single-crystalline melem (C6N10H6) nanorods (MNRs) were prepared by a facile thermal polymerization route under a flowing argon atmosphere. Compared with the bulk melem counterpart and g-C3N4, the MNRs exhibited substantially improved efficiency and stability towards the photodegradation of diverse organic pollutants including methyl orange, rhodamine B, and methylene blue. Moreover, the average photocatalytic hydrogen evolution rate of MNRs was about 2.6 folds higher than that of bulk melem under the same conditions. The enhanced photocatalytic redox performance of MNRs arises from the single-crystal nature and novel one-dimensional (1D) nanorod morphology, contributing to elevated conduction band potentials and promoting charge transport dynamics. This study not only reports single-crystalline melem 1D nanostructures as novel highly efficient and stable molecular-crystal photocatalysts, but also reveals the important roles of synergetic tuning of charge potentials and dynamics in enhancing the photocatalytic activity of molecular-crystal photocatalysts.									13	0	0	0	1	0	13			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000471010900031

The CoFe alloy nanoparticles with oxygen defects (O*) based on metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) were decorated on polyacrylonitrile (PAN)-driven carbon nanofiber (CNF) membrane to obtain the bifunctional photocathode (CoFe-OVs@CNF) with both extraordinary photo-catalytic and electro-catalytic abilities. PFOA was highly mineralized on CoFe-OVs@CNF through the synergy of photocatalytic oxidation and electro-Fenton processes. Moreover, the energy consumption for degradation was generated from direct electro-oxidation of glucose as the clean power on anode (GFC). The possible mechanism and degradation pathway for PFOA mineralization was investigated in detail according to intermediate analysis, active species verification and the valence state change of Co and Fe on cathode. Besides, the toxicity evolution during PFOA degradation was also evaluated to deeper insight into risk assessment of intermedia products and relative toxicity, intending to prove the potential for practical elimination of PFOA and other toxicity recalcitrant pollutants in wastewater by GFC-SPEF system.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000800010600005

Antimony-doped tin dioxide nanocoatings deposited on a titanium foam substrate (Ti/Sb-SnO2) with different Sb/Sn ratios (4.8-14.0 mol%) and loading weight of Sb-SnO2(4.4-7.7 mg cm(-2)) were used as dimensionally stable anodes. Sn and Sb were homogeneously dispersed on the substrate, and a crack-free nanocoating was built when the loading of nanocoating was increased to 6.3 mg cm(-2). The activity tests for oxidation of benzene showed that 40 ppm gaseous benzene was converted to CO2 with high selectivity (85%) at the low cell voltage of 2.0 V in this all-solid cell. The conversion of benzene was greatly increased from 30% to 100% upon increasing the Sb/Sn ratio of the nanocoating from 4.7 mol% to 14.0 mol%. With the increase of nanocoating loading (Sb/Sn = 14.0 mol%) from 6.3 to 7.7 mg cm(-2), the conversion of 100 ppm benzene was increased from 70% to 100%. Cyclic voltammetry revealed that high Sb content in the oxide nanocoating increased the overpotential and current intensity of the oxygen evolution reaction. The large outer charge q(0)* related to the electroactive surface of the SS-7.7/Ti3 electrode was up to 305.3 mC cm(-2), which were responsible for its excellent electrochemical performance in the benzene oxidation process. Our studies provide a potential method for removal of indoor VOCs at ambient temperature. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

Here we report a cathode consisting of nanoscale amorphous lithia (nanolithia) confined in a cobalt oxide, enabling charge/discharge between solid Li2O/Li2O2/LiO2 without any gas evolution. The cathode has a theoretical capacity of 1,341 Ah kg(-1), a mass density exceeding 2.2 g cm(-3), and a practical discharge capacity of 587 Ah kg(-1) at 2.55V versus Li/Li+. It also displays stable cycling performance (only 1.8% loss after 130 cycles in lithium-matched full-cell tests against Li4Ti5O12 anode), as well as a round-trip overpotential of only 0.24V. Interestingly, the cathode is automatically protected from O-2 gas release and overcharging through the shuttling of self-generated radical species soluble in the carbonate electrolyte.									119	10	0	0	9	0	124			2058-7546			WOS:000394180600001

Nano convergence				1	1			18	18		10.1186/s40580-014-0018-2				2014	2014	The renewed interest in two-dimensional materials, particularly transition metal dichalcogenides, has been explosive, evident in a number of review and perspective articles on the topic. Our ability to synthesize and study these 2D materials down to a single layer and to stack them to form van der Waals heterostructures opens up a wide range of possibilities from fundamental studies of nanoscale effects to future electronic and optoelectronic applications. Bottom-up and top-down synthesis and basic electronic properties of 2D chalcogenide materials have been covered in great detail elsewhere. Here, we bring attention to more subtle effects: how the environmental, surface, and crystal defects modify the electronic band structure and transport properties of 2D chalcogenide nanomaterials. Surface effects such as surface oxidation and substrate influence may dominate the overall transport properties, particularly in single layer chalcogenide devices. Thus, understanding such effects is critical for successful applications based on these materials. In this review, we discuss two classes of chalcogenides - Bi-based and Mo-based chalcogenides. The first are topological insulators with unique surface electronic properties and the second are promising for flexible optoelectronic applications as well as hydrogen evolution catalytic reactions.									19	0	0	0	0	0	19			2196-5404			MEDLINE:28191398	28191398

The effects of the calcining temperature on the material's photocatalytic activity were also investigated. Results showed that HKLBT with high crystalline quality could be synthesized at low temperatures and that HKLBT prepared from KLBT calcined at 900 degrees C exhibited the greatest photocatalytic activity, with an average water splitting hydrogen evolution rate of 236.6 mu mol.h(-1) in pure water. The time course of water splitting indicated HKLBT has ability to split water into hydrogen and oxygen with long-term stability.									5	3	0	0	1	0	5			1000-6818			WOS:000311938700022

Electrochemical methods and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), were conducted to reveal the protection properties and the composition evolution of the passive film. The results indicated that the corrosion time would weak the protectiveness of passive film, which was attributed to the accumulation of defects and metal sulfides in the passive film. The decrease of composition percentage of Cr(2)O(3)made more negative effects on the protection properties of passive film than the increase of Cr(OH)(3)and CrO3, whose formation was related to the adequate supply of oxygen and water molecules. The metal sulfides such as NiS and MoS(2)formed during atomization tests reduced the content of alloy oxides in the passive film, and provided locations for the growth of defects.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1478-422X	1743-2782		WOS:000548941500001

SEM images show that the substrate surface is covered with a uniform, nanogranule like morphology. Optical band gap lies in the ultraviolet region. Hydrothermally prepared TiO2 nanogranules show a good photocatalytic H-2 evolution activity. The photocatalytic hydrogen production rate for TiO2 nanogranules found to be 79.1 mu mol g(-1) h(-1) after each 9 h cycle.									34	1	0	0	1	0	34			0009-2614	1873-4448		WOS:000480699500033

The system is formed by an undivided cell containing a H-2-diffusion anode, an O-2-diffusion cathode, and a KOH solution as electrolyte. It can work in batch or in continuous mode, cogenerating electricity and HO2-, which is formed from the two-electron reduction of O-2 at the cathode. The evolution of cell voltage, current density, HO2- production, and current efficiency with time have been determined when the electrolyte remains quiescent, recirculates through the cell, or is continuously injected to it. This last device yields the best operative parameters, allowing current densities of 130 mA cm(-2) and current efficiencies close to 100% using 1 mol dm(-3) KOH at 20 degrees C. The effect of HO2- upon the anodic and cathodic reactions has been studied by linear sweep voltammetry. Adsorption of this species on the cathode can explain the loss of performance of the AFC with working time using a quiescent electrolyte or under recirculation conditions. The O-2-diffusion cathode and the AFC showed good reversibility when the cell contained a fresh KOH solution with HO2-.									47	4	0	0	2	0	52			0013-4651			WOS:000076217000021

The target systems were prepared by the initial plasma enhanced-chemical vapor deposition of manganese oxides on alumina substrates, followed by annealing in inert atmospheres and functionalization with Ag and SnO(2)by radio frequency-sputtering on the Mn(2)O(3)surface. The survey scans of the fabricated samples, along with detailed spectra of the C 1s, O 1s, Mn 2p, Mn 3s, and, eventually, Ag 3d, Ag MVV, and Sn 3d regions, were collected and analyzed in detail. The obtained results revealed the formation of composite systems characterized by the presence of Mn(2)O(3)free from other manganese oxides and pure SnO2, whereas appreciable Ag oxidation was observed. The O 1s photoelectron peaks could be fitted by means of two components related to lattice oxygen and to hydroxyl groups/oxygen species chemisorbed on surface O defects. The occurrence of the latter could exert a beneficial effect on the system functional behavior in gas sensing and electrocatalytic applications.									4	0	0	0	1	0	4			1055-5269	1520-8575		WOS:000559165200001

(1992) we study the physical parameters of Wolf-Rayet stars, which can be expressed as a function of one main parameter, the mass of the bare stellar core, and the chemical composition to a smaller extent. We show the existence of simple relations between mass, luminosity, radius and effective temperature determined at optical depth tau = 2/3 in the wind. Analytical expressions and graphical representations of these relations are given. In addition our evolutionary models predict a relation between the initial ZAMS mass and the luminosity of the WNL and WNE stars. New indication for mass-dependent mass loss rates as found by Langer (1989b) is also obtained from the correlation of surface mass flux and temperature given by Howarth & Schmutz (1992) and the relations obtained in this work.WC and WO stars offer the unique opportunity to study the abundance of the products of partial He-burning, carbon and oxygen. Thus they provide us with valuable information about massive star evolution and the underlying physics, especially mass loss in post MS phases and the efficiency of convection. In this work C and O surface abundances predicted by evolutionary models using commonly adopted mass loss rates and enhanced post MS mass loss rates are compared to observations. The influence of overshooting and adopted nuclear reaction rates is discussed. All observations of surface abundances and the observed number ratios of different WR stars lead us to suggest that massive stars have larger post main-sequence mass loss rates than commonly adopted.									122	0	0	0	1	0	122			0004-6361			WOS:A1992JQ25500016

Here, we sequenced the complete mitochondrial genome (mitogenome) of Dolycoris. baccarum living in the Tibetan Plateau (DBHC, similar to 3200 m above sea level (asl)) and conducted a detailed comparative analysis with another D. baccarum mitogenome (DBQY) from relatively low altitude (similar to 1300 m asl). All the 37 mitochondrial genes were highly conserved and under purifying selection, except for two mitochondrial protein-coding genes (MPCGs) (atp6 and nad5) that showed positively selected signatures. We therefore further examined non-synonymous substitutions in atp6 and nad5, by sequencing more individuals from three populations with different altitudes. We found that these non-synonymous substitutions were polymorphic in these populations, likely due to relaxed selection constraints in different altitudes. Purifying selection in all mitochondrial genes may be due to their functional importance for the precision of ATP production usually. Length difference in mitochondrial control regions between DBHC and DBQY was also conversed at the population level, indicating that sequence size adjustments in control region may be associated with adaptation to divergent altitudes. Quantitatively real-time PCR analysis for 12 MPCGs showed that gene expression patterns had a significant change between the two populations, suggesting that expression levels of MPCGs could be modulated by divergent environmental pressures (e.g. oxygen content and ambient temperature). These results provided an important guide for further uncovering genetic mechanisms of ecological adaptation in insects.									6	1	0	0	5	0	7			2470-1394	2470-1408		WOS:000461357300002	29521177

In this work, we propose a strategy that allows precise and independent control of the Pt particle size and coverage. Our approach exploits the versatility of the atomic layer deposition (ALD) technique by combining two ALD processes for Pt using different reactants. The particle areal density is controlled by tailoring the number of ALD cycles using trimethyl(methylcyclopentadienyl) platinum and oxygen, while subsequent growth using the same Pt precursor in combination with nitrogen plasma allows for tuning of the particle size at the atomic level. The excellent control over the particle morphology is clearly demonstrated by means of in situ and ex situ X-ray fluorescence and grazing incidence small angle X-ray scattering experiments, providing information about the Pt loading, average particle dimensions, and mean center-to-center particle distance.									72	2	0	0	4	0	73			2041-1723			WOS:000413353500023	29057871

The S-dope midgap states were determined by monitoring the effect of the photocurrent on the addition of several reductants. The midgap states for the S-doped anatase TiO2 has higher redox potentials than those of the Br . /Br- and possesses the additional multiple oxidation states of S cations. The laser ablation of the BiVO4 and BiZn2VO6 photocatalytic particulates in water reduced these sizes and it was found that the thin film electrode prepared by calcining the laser-ablated BiVO4 and BiZn2VO6 suspensions showed higher photocurrent efficiencies compared with the electrodes prepared without laser-ablation. The composite electrode FTO/SnO2/BiVO4 and FTO/WO3/BiVO4 were prepared by a solution method and the photocurrent efficiencies for these electrodes were found to be increased due to the mediator effect of SnO2 and WO3, which helps the electrons in the conduction band of BiVO4 to transfer to the FTO. The new photocatalytic particulates that are active for oxygen evolution under the visible light irradiation was searched and the BiCu2PO6 was found to be active with the addition of sacrifice under the visible light irradiations.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			1344-3542	2186-2451		WOS:000263152700004

The experiments were conducted in a shock tube where hydrogen gas is shock-accelerated into a partly confined oxygen environment across a perforated plate. Although the considered scenario differs from most practical applications where high pressure hydrogen is released into air, the results may be applicable toward cases where hydrogen leaks are shock assisted through holes in fuel cell membranes. Schlieren visualization permitted the reconstruction of the gas dynamic evolution of the release while time resolved self-luminosity records permitted us to record whether ignition was achieved. Despite the presence of confinement in the experiments, the ignition limits determined experimentally were found to be relatively agreeable with trends predicted by a previously developed 1-D numerical model (Maxwell and Radulescu, 2011), which assumes a release into an unconfined environments. However, the role of confinement in the experiments not only influence ignition at lower limits compared to the 1-D ignition model, but was also found to promote turbulent mixing through shock reflections and flow instabilities. Turbulent mixing thus influences how the ignition spots interact to ignite the entire jet. Copyright (C) 2012, Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

The prepared catalysts were evaluated for partial hydrogenation of benzene towards cyclohexene generation by applying ZnSO4, MnSO4 and FeSO4 as reaction additives. The fresh and spent catalysts were thoroughly characterized by XRD, X ray fluorescence (XRF), XPS, TEM and N-2-physicalsorption in order to understand the promotion effect of Mn3O4 as the modifier as well as ZnSO4, MnSO4 and FeSO4 as reaction additives. It was found that 72.0% of benzene conversion and 79.2% of cyclohexene selectivity was achieved after 25 min of reaction time over Ru@Mn3O4 with a molar ratio of Mn/Ru being 0.46. This can be rationalized in terms of the formed (Zn(OH)(2))(3)(ZnSO4)(H2O)(3) on the Ru surface from the reaction between Mn3O4 and the added ZnSO4. Furthermore, Fe2+ and Fe3+ compounds could be generated and adsorbed on the surface of Ru@Mn3O4 when FeSO4 is applied as a reaction additive. The most electrons were transferred from Ru to Fe, resulting in that lowest benzene conversion of 1.5% and the highest cyclohexene selectivity of 92.2% after 25 min of catalytic experiment. On the other hand, by utilizing MnSO4 as an additive, no electrons transfer was observed between Ru and Mn, which lead to the complete hydrogenation of benzene towards cyclohexane within 5 min. In comparison, moderate amount of electrons were transferred from Ru to Zn2+ in (Zn(OH)(2))(3)(ZnSO4)(H2O)(3) when ZnSO4 is used as a reaction additive, and the highest cyclohexene yield of 57.0% was obtained within 25 min of reaction time.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1				2079-4991		WOS:000539577200212	32340312

The sticking of acetic acid is very efficient and results in hydrogen evolution and acetate formation at room temperature. The acetate decomposes between 320 and 440 K to produce CO2 and hydrogen coincidently and leaves C adsorbed on the surface. The presence of carbon results in a changed desorption profile after readsorbing acid on the surface, manifesting an autocatalytic decomposition profile, with a half-height width of as low as 9 K and a slowed decomposition rate (higher peak temperature). Surprisingly, at higher temperatures where the acetate is unstable (>450 K), the sticking of acetic acid continues at a steady-state rate and is not poisoned by the buildup of C on the crystal. This is due to the fact that most of the C deposited is lost from the surface to the bulk in a facile manner above about 450 K, leaving a reactive surface which is apparently continually available for decomposition. The reactive surface appears to be Pd(1 1 0) with 0.5 monolayers of C adsorbed in the c(2 x 2) structure, which acts as a template for increased stability and ordering of the acetate adlayer.

Simultaneously, the dielectric and leakage current characteristics of the thin films were obtained. Evolution of the Aurivillius layer structure was confirmed by XRD and HR-TEM results. A saturated hysteresis loop with larger remanent polarization (2P(r)) and excellent retention properties are observed in all thin films. The values of 2P(r) in the film capacitors are all about 50 C cm(-2) besides the n = 3 film, in which the leakage current increases significantly in larger electric fields. The leakage current values of films Bi5FeTi3O15, Bi6Fe2Ti3O18 and Bi7Fe3Ti3O21 gradually increased with increasing n, and the leakage current mechanism was studied by various conduction mechanisms. The combined relationships of the ferroelectric polarization, leakage current, polarization fatigue and retention of BFTO thin films are discussed in terms of the structural characteristics, aggregation of oxygen vacancies and crystallite grain size in the films. The results of optimization of the ferroelectric properties in Aurivillius phase thin films with higher n by chemical solution deposition are useful for further exploration of single-phase multiferroics in the Aurivillius family and other layer structure compounds with potential applications in the field of ferroelectric-based data storage.									28	0	0	0	1	0	28			2050-7526	2050-7534		WOS:000442612500003

The relative thermodynamic stability associated with the chemisorption of oxygen atoms at various positions on hexagonal graphene flakes (HGFs) of D-6h-symmetry is determined by two factors - viz. the disruption of the p-conjugation of the HGF and the geometrical deformation of the HGF structure. The thermodynamically most stable structure is achieved when the former factor is minimized, and the latter factor is simultaneously maximized. Infrared (IR) spectra computed using DFT and DFTB reveal a close correlation between the relative thermodynamic stabilities of the oxidized HGF structures and their IR spectral activities. The most stable oxidized structures exhibit significant IR activity between 600 and 1800 cm(-1), whereas less stable oxidized structures exhibit little to no activity in this region. In contrast, Raman spectra are found to be less informative in this respect.									50	1	0	0	0	0	50			1463-9076	1463-9084		WOS:000315165100006	23388654

The neutrinos emitted from thermonuclear-type Ia-supernovae also possess the same potential, although these supernovae are dimmer neutrino sources. For the first time, we calculate the time, energy, line of sight, and neutrino-flavor-dependent features of the neutrino signal expected from a three-dimensional delayed-detonation explosion simulation, where a deflagration-to-detonation transition triggers the complete disruption of a near-Chandrasekhar mass carbon-oxygen white dwarf. We also calculate the neutrino flavor evolution along eight lines of sight through the simulation as a function of time and energy using an exact three-flavor transformation code. We identify a characteristic spectral peak at similar to 10 MeV as a signature of electron captures on copper. This peak is a potentially distinguishing feature of explosion models since it reflects the nucleosynthesis conditions early in the explosion. We simulate the event rates in the Super-K, Hyper-K, JUNO, and DUNE neutrino detectors with the SNOwGLoBES event rate calculation software and also compute the IceCube signal. Hyper-K will be able to detect neutrinos from our model out to a distance of similar to 10 kpc. At 1 kpc, JUNO, Super-K, and DUNE would register a few events while IceCube and Hyper-K would register several tens of events.									20	0	0	0	0	0	20			2470-0010	2470-0029		WOS:000380114700008		
J	Yun, So Yeon; Jin, Xiaoyan; Hwang, Seong-Ju								A one-pot carbon-coating-ex-solution route to efficient Ru-MnO@C nanowire electrocatalysts with enhanced interfacial interactions								CHEMICAL ENGINEERING JOURNAL				446						136816	10.1016/j.cej.2022.136816				OCT 15 2022	2022	The immobilization of metal nanoclusters in an inorganic matrix has attracted intense research interest because of its usefulness in exploring highly efficient electrocatalyst materials. In this study, a novel one-pot carbon-coating-ex-solution route to robust high-performance electrocatalysts of metal-nanocluster-embedded carbon-coated inorganic nanostructures was developed by the C(2)H(2 )treatment of metal-substituted MnO(2 )nanowires at elevated temperatures. The calcination of Ru-substituted Mn1-xRuxO2 nanowires under a flow of C2H(2)/Ar led not only to the simultaneous carbon coating and reductive formation of MnO, but also to the ex-solution embedding of Ru nanoclusters between the MnO substrate and the coated carbon layers. The resulting Ru-embedded Ru-MnO@C nanowires showed a promising electrocatalytic performance with an improved stability for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), and this performance was superior to those of Ru-deposited Ru-MnO@C nanowires, Ru-free MnO@C nanowires, and Mn1-xRuxO2 nanowires. The Ru-MnO@C nanowires possessed an excellent electrochemical stability due to the formation of strong interfacial Ru4+-O-Mn2+ bonding and the promoted crystallization of the tight graphitic carbon layer by Ru anchoring. Furthermore, in situ surface-enhanced Raman scattering and electron paramagnetic resonance analyses provided strong evidence for the improved interfacial charge transfer kinetics and enhanced electron injection from MnO to the Ru nanoclusters. This is responsible for the beneficial effect of the simultaneous carbon-coating-ex-solution process on the HER electrocatalyst functionality.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000803691700007

The current route in synthesis of Co3O4 hexagonal plates with the most active (1 1 2) exposed facet is free of any organic solvent, surfactant, or coordinator, close to the nominal material yield. Well-controlled Au assembly onto the (1 1 2) facet of h-M0.18CO2.82O4 results in very efficient Au/h-M0.18CO2.82O4 for the target reaction. The processes developed for both controllable support fabrication and governable Au assembly are applicable to other systems and utilizations. N-2 sorption, X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy/(high-resolution) transmission electron microscopy, selected-area electron diffraction, energy-dispersive X-ray mapping, inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry, H-2 temperature-programmed reduction, O-2 temperature-programmed desorption, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy were performed to understand the physicochemical properties of various interfaces. Turnover frequency calculation and activation energy determination were used to reveal distinct catalytic behaviors. The factors significantly determining the interface activity are as follows: (1) the critical support orientation and element constitution [h-MxCo3-xO4 (1 1 2) (M = Fe, Mn, x = 0.09-0.1 8)]; (2) the surface reconstruction [from (1 1 2) to (1 1 1)] owing to increasing dopant content; (3) the evolution of reactive oxygen species (O-I(-) vs. O-II(-)) and the oxidation state of Au entities.

As-anodized hierarchical Cu-Ti-O nanotube arrays consist of two distinct Ti-rich and Cu-rich nanotube regions. It was found that mechanical stresses induced by copper doping resulted in the difference in the microstructure evolution of Cu-rich and Ti-rich regions The oxygen vacancies induced by the high concentration Cu dopant into the Cu-Ti-O nanotube play a crucial role in determining the phase stabilization of anatase phase. The absorption edge of TiO2 nanotube arrays was extended Into the visible region by Cu doping In degrading Methyl orange (MO), 21 2% MO was removed using Cu-Ti-O nanotube arrays after 240 min UV illumination This result indicates the photocatalytic activity of Cu-Ti-O nanotube arrays to MO is reasonably high (C) 2010 Elsevier B V All rights reserved.									21	4	0	0	0	0	27			0925-8388	1873-4669		WOS:000279511300031

The influence of current density, dye concentration, flow rate, and temperature was investigated, in order to find the best conditions for COD and colour removal. It was found that, during oxidation, a polymeric film, causing BDD deactivation, was formed in the potential region of water stability, and that it was removed by anodic polarisation at high potentials in the region Of 02 evolution. Bulk electrolysis results showed that the electrochemical process was suitable for completely removing COD and effectively decolourising wastewaters, due to the production of hydroxyl radicals on the diamond surface. In particular, under optimal experimental conditions of flow rates (i.e. 300 dm(3) h(-1)) and current density (i.e. 20 mA cm(-2)), 97% of COD was removed in 12 h electrolysis, with 70 kWh m(-3) energy consumption.

Herein, hierarchical porous O-doped graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) nanotubes (OCN-Tube) are prepared via successive thermal oxidation exfoliation and curling-condensation of bulk g-C3N4. The as-prepared OCN-Tube exhibits hierarchically porous structures, which consist of interconnected multiwalled nanotubes with uniform diameters of 20-30 nm. The hierarchical OCN-Tube shows excellent photocatalytic CO2 reduction performance under visible light, with methanol evolution rate of 0.88 mu mol g(-1) h(-1), which is five times higher than bulk g-C3N4 (0.17 mu mol g(-1) h(-1)). The enhanced photocatalytic activity of OCN-Tube is ascribed to the hierarchical nanotube structure and O-doping effect. The hierarchical nanotube structure endows OCN-Tube with higher specific surface area, greater light utilization efficiency, and improved molecular diffusion kinetics, due to the more exposed active edges and multiple light reflection/scattering channels. The O-doping optimizes the band structure of g-C3N4, resulting in narrower bandgap, greater CO2 affinity, and uptake capacity as well as higher separation efficiency of photogenerated charge carriers. This work provides a novel strategy to design hierarchical g-C3N4 nanostructures, which can be used as promising photocatalyst for solar energy conversion.									808	56	1	0	68	0	820			1613-6810	1613-6829		WOS:000399019700016	28160415

Inductively coupled plasma measurements show that the amount of ZnO of prepared samples increases with the increase of initial concentration of Zn2+ in the mother solution. Powder X-ray diffraction measurements and scanning electron microscope images show that the modification of ZnO has little effects on the lattice parameters and the particle sizes of the [Ni4Al(OH)(10)]OH, but does change the morphology. The charge-discharge cycles results show that the deterioration rate of discharge capacity for the electrode with ZnO is only 4.0 % after 255 cycles, which is lower than that of electrode without ZnO (8.5 %); meanwhile, the maximal numbers of exchanged electrons per nickel atom for the electrodes with ZnO are basically over 1.83, which are higher than that of the electrode without ZnO (1.73), indicating that the modification of ZnO can improve the utilization of active material. In addition, the cyclic voltammogram tests results show that the modification of ZnO not only improves electrochemical cyclic reversibility but also elevates the oxygen evolution potential. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy measurements show that the modification of ZnO can lower the double layer capacitance and the charge transfer resistance.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			1432-8488	1433-0768		WOS:000329105400005

Around Sun-like stars, CO2 photolysis by Far-UV (FUV) radiation is balanced by recombination reactions that depend on water abundance. Planets orbiting M dwarf stars experience more FUV radiation, and could be depleted in water due to M dwarfs' prolonged, high-luminosity pre-main sequences. We show that, for water-depleted M dwarf terrestrial planets, a catalytic cycle relying on H2O2 photolysis can maintain a CO2 atmosphere. However, this cycle breaks down for atmospheric hydrogen mixing ratios < 1 ppm, resulting in similar to 40% of the atmospheric CO2 being converted to CO and O-2 on a timescale of 1 Myr. The increased O-2 abundance leads to high O-3 concentrations, the photolysis of which forms another CO(2)regenerating catalytic cycle. For atmospheres with < 0.1 ppm hydrogen, CO2 is produced directly from the recombination of CO and O. These catalytic cycles place an upper limit of similar to 50% on the amount of CO2 that can be destroyed via photolysis, which is enough to generate Earth-like abundances of (abiotic) O-2 and O-3. The conditions that lead to such high oxygen levels could be widespread on planets in the habitable zones of M dwarfs. Discrimination between biological and abiotic O-2 and O-3 in this case can perhaps be accomplished by noting the lack of water features in the reflectance and emission spectra of these planets, which necessitates observations at wavelengths longer than 0.95 mu m.									66	0	0	0	10	0	66			0004-637X	1538-4357		WOS:000357129500104

[2]X-4 showed a colour change from orange to dark green upon dehydration, reflecting the geometrical conversion of the Co-II centres in [Co-2(mu-H2O)(H2O)(5)](4+) from an octahedron to a tetrahedron by the removal of aqua ligands. While both [2]Cl-4 and [2]Br-4 electrochemically catalysed water reduction to H-2 in the solid state due to the presence of Pd-II active centres, water oxidation to O-2 was catalysed only by [2]Br-4, which is ascribed to the presence of Br- ions that mediate the catalytic reactions that occurred at Co-II active centres.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			1477-9226	1477-9234		WOS:000701038800001	34586126

Here, it is demonstrated that the activity of the intrinsic carbon defects can be dramatically improved through coupling with single-atom Fe-N-4 sites. The resulting catalyst delivers a maximum CO Faradaic efficiency of 90% and a CO partial current density of 33 mA cm(-2) in 0.1 m KHCO3. The remarkable enhancements are maintained in concentrated electrolyte, endowing a rechargeable Zn-CO2 battery with a high CO selectivity of 86.5% at 5 mA cm(-2). Further analysis suggests that the intrinsic defect is the active sites for CO2RR, instead of the Fe-N-4 center. Density functional theory calculations reveal that the Fe-N-4 coupled intrinsic defect exhibits a reduced energy barrier for CO2RR and suppresses the hydrogen evolution activity. The high intrinsic activity, coupled with fast electron-transfer capability and abundant exposed active sites, induces excellent electrocatalytic performance.									106	5	0	0	4	0	106			0935-9648	1521-4095		WOS:000592210100001	33241569

However, the development of novel catalysts possessing high activity at a low cost is very challenging. Recently, extensive research has indicated that nitrogen-doped carbon materials, which include nonprecious metals as well as metal-based oxides, can be used as excellent candidates for the ORR. Here, Co/Co3O4@N-doped carbon (NC) with a low cost and highly stable performance is utilized as an ORR electrocatalyst through the pyrolysis of an easily prepared physical mixture containing a cobalt-based zeolite imidazolate framework (ZIF-67 precursor) and biomass materials from poplar flowers. Compared with the pure ZIF-derived counterpart (Co@NC) and PL-bio-C, the as-synthesized electrocatalysts show significantly enhanced ORR activities. The essential roles of doped atoms (ZIF-67 precursor) in improving the ORR activities are discussed. Depending mainly on the formation of Co-Co3O4 active sites and abundant nitrogen-containing groups, the resulting Co/Co3O4@NC catalyst exhibits good electroactivity (onset and half-wave potentials: E-onset = 0.94 V and E-1/2 = 0.85 V, respectively, and a small Tafel slope of 90 mV dec(-1)) compared to Co@NC and PL-bio-C and follows the 4-electron pathway with good stability and methanol resistance. The results of this study provide a reference for exploring cobalt-based N-doped biomass carbon for energy conversion and storage applications.									7	0	0	0	0	0	7				2046-2069		WOS:000609865700014	35424214

We recorded simultaneous EEG-fMRI while subjects performed auditory and visual oddball tasks and used these data to investigate the BOLD correlates of single-trial EEG variability at latencies spanning the trial. We focused on variability along task-relevant dimensions in the EEG for identical stimuli and then combined auditory and visual data at the subject level to spatially and temporally localize brain regions involved in endogenous attentional modulations. Specifically, we found that anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) correlates strongly with both early and late EEG components, whereas brainstem, right middle frontal gyrus (rMFG), and right orbitofrontal cortex (rOFC) correlate significantly only with late components. By orthogonalizing with respect to event-related activity, we found that variability in insula and temporoparietal junction is reflected in reaction time variability, rOFC and brainstem correlate with residual EEG variability, and ACC and rMFG are significantly correlated with both. To investigate interactions between these correlates of temporally specific EEG variability, we performed dynamic causal modeling (DCM) on the fMRI data. We found strong evidence for reciprocal effective connections between the brainstem and cortical regions. Our results support the adaptive gain theory of locus ceruleus-norepinephrine (LC-NE) function and the proposed functional relationship between the LC-NE system, right-hemisphere ventral attention network, and P300 EEG response.									65	1	0	0	41	0	65			0270-6474			WOS:000328110100017	24305817

However, in this study, we found that the removal efficiencies of p-nitrophenol (PNP) by micro zero-valent iron (mFe(0)) could maintain at the satisfactory level in the process of continuous reactions (20 cycles). The removal rate constant (0.1779 min(-1)) of the 5th cyclewas 6.74 times higher than that of the 1st reaction (0.0264 min(-1)), even the 20th cycle (0.0371 min(-1)) was higher than that of the 1st reaction. Interestingly, almost no dissolved iron was detected in the solution, and the total iron concentrations decreased dramatically with the process of continuous reactions. The results of scanning electron microscope and energy dispersive spectrometry (SEM-EDS) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) revealed that the structure and composition of corrosion products change from amorphous to highly crystal with the increase of the number of cycles. The corrosion products were mainly magnetite (Fe3O4) and a small part of maghemite (gamma-Fe2O3), which were in the form of microspheres on the surface of mFe(0). The formation of surface oxidation shell hindered the release of Fe2+. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) results illustrated that partial Fe3O4 could be converted into gamma-Fe2O3. Electrochemical analysis proved that the electron transfer rate of mFe(0) increased with the formation of the oxides shell. However, the consumption of iron core and thicker oxide film weakened the electron transfer rate. Besides, the quenching experiments indicated that the reaction activity of mFe(0) could be enhanced with the addition of scavengers. This study deepened the understanding of the structural transformation and radical production of mFe(0) in continuous reactions.

Timely perception of foreign molecules appears to be critical for the success of these defences. However, the nature of the molecular events required for resistance is largely unknown. Recent isolation of disease resistance (R) genes, has revealed that R gene products have several features in common. This finding suggests that plants have evolved several common or similar signal transduction pathways to activate resistance to a range of unrelated microbes. R gene isolation and the genetic identification of other loci required for R function permits analysis of the structure and evolution of microbe-perception mechanisms. Numerous types of activated defence responses are recognized. A requirement for salicylic acid in resistance has been established in some systems. Roles for other events, like reactive oxygen species and the hypersensitive (host cell death) response, remain enigmatic. A thorough understanding of the components leading to pathogen recognition and the expression of resistance should permit thr design of novel strategies to engineer broad-spectrum and durable plant disease control.									8	0	0	0	4	0	8			0028-646X	1469-8137		WOS:A1996UT50400003

Interface engineering is demonstrated to improve the ECR performance for metal and oxide composite catalysts. However, the approach to form a substantial interface is still limited. In this work, we report a facile one-pot coprecipitation method to synthetize novel silver and silver-doped ceria (Ag/CeO2) nanocomposites. This catalyst provides a rich 3D interface and high Ce3+ concentration (33.6%), both of which are beneficial for ECR to CO. As a result, Ag/CeO2 exhibits a 99% faradaic efficiency and 10.5 A g(-1) mass activity to convert CO2 into CO at an overpotential of 0.83 V. The strong interfacial interaction between Ag and CeO2 may enable the presence of surface Ce3+ and guarantee the improved durability during the electrolysis. We also develop numerical simulation to understand the local pH effect on the ECR performance and propose that the superior ECR performance of Ag/CeO2 is mainly due to the accelerated CO formation rate rather than the suppressed hydrogen evolution reaction.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000731110800001	34890504

Antibiotic residues in the environment are a major contributor to the spread of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs). Subinhibitory concentrations of antibiotics cause bacteria to produce reactive oxygen species (ROS), which can lead to mutagenesis and horizontal gene transfer (HGT) of ARGs; however, little is known about the mitigation of ARG dissemination through ROS removal by antioxidants. In this study, we examine how antioxidant-producing microorganisms inoculated in replicate activated sludge systems can biologically mitigate the dissemination of ARGs. Through quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR), we showed that antioxidant-producing microorganisms could decrease the persistence of the RP4 plasmid and alleviate enrichment of ARGs (sul1) and class 1 integrons (intl1). Metagenomic sequencing identified the most diverse resistome and the most mutated Escherichia coli ARGs in the reactor that contained antibiotics but no antioxidant-producing microorganisms, suggesting that antioxidantproducing microorganisms mitigated ARG enrichment and mutation. Host classification revealed that antioxidant-producing microorganisms decreased the diversity of ARG hosts by shaping the microbial community through competition and functional pathway changes. Conjugative experiments demonstrated that conjugative transfer of ARGs could be mitigated by coculture with antioxidant-producing microorganisms. Overall, this is a novel study that shows how ARG enrichment and HGT can be mitigated through bioaugmentation with antioxidant-producing microorganisms.									2	0	0	0	1	0	2			0013-936X	1520-5851		WOS:000758717600028	34615350

Although the electronic structure of MnO2 (band gap similar to 2 eV) indicates it could be a promising photo-anode material for solar water splitting, so far only quite small photocurrents have been obtained from manganese oxides. Here, we show that the photo-electrochemical water oxidation performance of MnOx films can be significantly improved by using buffered aqueous electrolytes containing amine ionic liquids. The buffered conditions to maintain a constant proton activity and the amine salt are both crucial for achieving high photocurrents. Photocurrents as high as 4.5 mA cm(-2) were obtained at 1.0 V vs. SCE (eta = 540 mV) in Bi buffered n-butylammonium nitrate (BAN) electrolyte at pH 9. The incident photon-to- current efficiency (IPCE) was found to be greater than 3% at 400 nm and 4% at 370 nm. Both H2O2 and O-2 are produced simultaneously in this system, with the potential subsequent decomposition of the H2O2 to form oxygen. An acceleration of the decomposition of H2O2 under illumination is proposed to explain the photocurrent improvement.									12	0	0	0	1	0	12			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000359184200035

Benefiting from the unique two-dimensional (2D) morphology and abundant terminals, 2D/2D "face-to-face" WO3 center dot H2O/g-C3N4 heterostructured self-assemblies were fabricated employing tungsten oxide hydrate (WO3 center dot H2O) nanoplates and graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) sheets as precursors. Compared to pristine WO3 center dot H2O and g-C3N4, the binary WO3 center dot H2O/g-C3N4 heterostructures exhibit excellent photocatalytic performance towards water decontamination, using organic dye rhodamine B/methyl orange as probes. It is found that WO3 center dot H2O/g-C3N4 with 20 wt% mass ratio (WHC-20) possesses the best photocatalytic activities, with about 3.05 times higher than that of pristine g-C3N4. The remarkable increase performance is attributed to the enhanced evolution of superoxide radicals (center dot O-2(-)) via photoreduction in adsorbed oxygen molecules (O-2(-)), which are promoted by efficient Z-scheme charges separation and rapid electrons transfer at 2D/2D interface. Given the low-cost, facile synthetic procedure and recycling stability, the heterostructured WO3 center dot H2O/g-C3N4 could be served as a promising photocatalyst to deal with water contamination.									14	0	0	0	2	0	14			0022-2461	1573-4803		WOS:000509691300008

Herein, we have successfully utilized biomass waste ferns contaminated by iron mines, to fabricate a first-of-its-kind high-performance class of Fe single-atom catalysts (FeSAC) by a facile pyrolysis. The optimal FeSAC-800 shows an excellent efficiency in the fast-photocatalytic degradation of six types of quinolone antibiotics (e.g., norfloxacin, levofloxacin, ciprofloxacin, enrofloxacin, lomefloxacin, flumequine) in 1 h under the simulated natural light irradiation. Based on advanced characterization, a well-defined structure of FeN4, confined in the porous carbon is elaborated for the FeSAC-800. Mechanism of the photodegradation is via a Fenton-like oxidation process whereas the reactive oxygen species play a key role. These findings open a new avenue for efficient, sustainable utilization of biomass waste in pollutant control.

They are also used as sensors or vehicles for targeted drug delivery combined with optical imaging. In this study, we demonstrated that glutathione-coated Ag2S QDs (GSH-Ag2S QDs) act as a substrate analogue of glutathione S-transferase (GST) enzymes for the first time in the literature. The GSTs belong to a major group of detoxification enzymes involved in the detoxification metabolism responsible for the protection of cells against reactive oxygen species (ROS) or electrophiles. GST isozymes are impaired in the various diseases such as neurological diseases and cancer. We evaluated the interaction of GST-pi enzyme with GSH-Ag2S QDs, which have never been studied in the literature before, using both fluorometric and spectrophotometric methods. Our data showed that GSH-Ag2S QDs gave reaction with GST enzyme as a substrate analogue. In conclusion, our data may help to guide researchers for further development of sensing systems for GST activity which is impaired in various diseases including cancer.									16	0	0	0	8	0	16			1747-0277	1747-0285		WOS:000485454500001	31452310

Low radon-222 concentrations (below background levels) and enriched amounts of oxygen-18 and deuterium in ground water indicate mixing with surface water in parts of the basin. Comparison of surface water and regional ground water flow patterns indicate that boundaries for ground water basins typically do not coincide with surface water drainage subbasins. There are several areas in the basin where around water flow that originates outside of the Suwannee River basin crosses surface water basin boundaries during both low-flow and high-flow conditions. In a study area adjacent to the Suwannee River that consists predominantly of agricultural land use, 18 wells tapping the Upper Floridan aquifer and 7 springs were sampled three times during 1990 through 1994 for major dissolved inorganic constituents, trace elements, and nutrients. During a period of above normal rainfall that resulted in high river stage and high ground water levels in 1991, the combination of increased amounts of dissolved organic carbon and decreased levels of dissolved oxygen in ground water created conditions favorable for the natural reduction of nitrate by denitrification reactions in the aquifer. As a result, less nitrate was discharged by ground water to the Suwannee River.									37	1	2	1	13	0	42			0043-1370			WOS:000071498000008

First, the P-MoS2 nanosheets were obtained by the phosphidation of MoS2 at 300 degrees C and using NaH2PO2 as P source. Then, the coupling of P-MoS2 nanosheets with CdS NPs was completed by a hydrothermal treatment. The photocatalytic performance of resulted composite was evaluated by evolution of H-2 from water splitting. The experimental results revealed that the P-MoS2/CdS composite containing 20% P-MoS2 exhibited an optimum H-2 evolution rate as high as 58.9 mu mol h(-1), which was 2.9 and 2.3 times higher than that of the pristine CdS (20.5 mu mol h(-1)) and 0.2MoS(2)/CdS (26.1 mu mol h(-1)), respectively. The improved activity of P-MoS2/CdS composite compared to MoS2/CdS can be ascribed to (i) its enhanced visible-light absorption, (ii) its efficient electron-hole separation resulting from the enhanced conductivity of P-MoS2, the positive conduction band potential of P-MoS2 in comparison with that of MoS2, and (iii) the more exposed active sites on P-MoS2 resulting from the enlarged interlayer spacing. This work may open up a new avenue to explore other hybrid co-catalysts to enhance the charge separation and thus the photocatalytic H-2-evolution performance of semiconductors.									68	3	0	0	5	0	68			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000483341000146

These sub-millimeter-sized particles can self-propel as they contain Pt-covered magnetite (Fe3O4) nanoparticles, where the Pt can decompose catalytically a "fuel" like H2O2 and thereby propel the supraparticles. By their magnetic properties, the catalytically active nanoparticles can be concentrated in patches on the supraparticle surface. The goal is to obtain robust supraparticles with well-defined patchiness and long-time stability during self-propulsion through evaporation-induced self-assembly (EISA) on a superhydrophobic surface. The latter is a major issue as oxygen evolution can lead to the disintegration of the supraparticles. Therefore, enhanced mechanical stability is sought using a number of different additives, where the best results are obtained by incorporating polystyrene microspheres followed by heat treatment or reinforcement with microfibrillated cellulose (MFC) and sodium trisilicate (Na2SiO3). The detailed internal structure of the different types of particles is investigated by confocal micro-X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy (CMXRF), which allows for precisely locating the catalytic Fe3O4@Pt nanoparticles within the supraparticles with a resolution in the mu m range. The insights on the supraparticle structure, together with their long-time stability, allow fabricating optimized patchy supraparticles for potential applications in propulsion-enhanced catalysis.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			0934-0866	1521-4117		WOS:000647036100001

In the structures, the presence of N and P atoms, abundant CNTs and the CoP nanoparticles can enhance electrochemical activity and promote the structural stability of materials. As the temperature increases, the Zn contents gradually reduce to zero, which provides more active sites for electrochemical testing. Furthermore, the high specific surface area and microporous behavior of NPC-CNTs-CoP-9 make it excellent in electrocatalytic testing. NPC-CNTs-CoP-9 shows a low overpotential of 224 mV at 10 mA center dot cm(-2) in 1.0 mol center dot L-1 KOH solution. The strategy of zeolitic imidazole framework-derived transition metal phosphides will provide a new sight for developing energy conversion materials.									47	9	0	0	1	0	47			1001-0521	1867-7185		WOS:000538372800009

With sulfate and chloride anions in the electrolyte we found unique transpassive peaks in the cyclic voltammograms that appear to be associated with an amorphous-to-crystalline transition and subsequent enhanced species transport along the resulting grain boundaries. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, secondary-ion-mass spectrometry, and ion-scattering spectrometry have been used to characterize the films before and after the passive film breakdown. The passive film breakdown can be qualitatively described by E-np = E-c + eta + Phi + E-inh Where E-np is the pitting potential, E-c the corrosion potential in acidified solution, eta the polarization necessary to obtain a current density high enough to maintain acidity inside the pit,Phi the potential drop inside of the pit, and Einh the contribution to the pitting potential resulting from inhibitors present. The results of these surface studies along with the variation in the cyclic voltammetry scans have been used to describe the process and to present a model that involves chemically bound water oxidation and local oxygen evolution. The effects of either Ohmic drop and/or local acidification are presented as well. (C) 2000 American Vacuum Society.

Photosynthetic pigment contents, whole cell oxygen yield, C-14-fixation and PS II activity decreased with increasing doses of UV-B exposure (15 and 60 min), however, the inhibitory effect in N. muscorum was more pronounced than in P boryanum and a least effect was noticed in Aphanothece sp. Among the photosynthetic pigments, phycocyanin was severely affected by UV-B in N. muscorum followed by P boryanum and Aphanothece sp. 14 C-fixation was found to be more sensitive parameter to UV-B than whole cell photosynthetic oxygen evolution. UV-B exposed spheroplasts exhibited severe damage on PS II activity and little effect on the activity of PS I. Partial restoration of PS It activity by electron donors (NH2OH, MnCl2 and DPC) suggested that UV-B interrupted the electron flow by affecting the component of water oxidation site as well as reaction center of PS II and the extent of damage on PS II was dependent on UV-B exposure time as well as the cyanobacterial strains. Suppression in emission peak (lambda max 651 nm) of phycocyanin revealed that UV-B altered the energy transfer efficiency of phycocyanin to PS II reaction center. Furthermore, UV-B with increasing doses enhanced lipid peroxidation and the activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT) and peroxidase (POD). However, the enhancement in SOD activity in N. muscorum (13-25%), P. boryanum (18-34%) and Aphanothece sp. (24-53%) was high as compared with CAT and POD activity. (C) 2009 SAAB.

PsaL, a 16 kDa hydrophobic protein, a subunit of the PSI RC, was previously identified as crucial for the formation of PSI trimers. In this work, the physiological effects accompanied by PSI oligomerization were studied using a PsaL-deficient mutant (Delta psaL), not able to form PSI trimers, grown at various temperatures. We demonstrate that in wild-type Synechocystis, the monomer to trimer ratio depends on the growth temperature. The inactivation of the psaL gene in Synechocystis grown phototropically at 30 degrees C induces profound morphological changes, including the accumulation of glycogen granules localized in the cytoplasm, resulting in the separation of particular thylakoid layers. The carotenoid composition in Delta psaL shows that PSI monomerization leads to an increased accumulation of myxoxantophyll, zeaxanthin and echinenone irrespective of the temperature conditions. These xanthophylls are formed at the expense of beta-carotene. The measured H2O -> CO2 oxygen evolution rates in the Delta psaL mutant are higher than those observed in the wild type, irrespective of the growth temperature. Moreover, circular dichroism spectroscopy in the visible range reveals that a peak attributable to long-wavelength-absorbing carotenoids is apparently enhanced in the trimer-accumulating wild-type cells. These results suggest that specific carotenoids are accompanied by the accumulation of PSI oligomers and play a role in the formation of PSI oligomer structure.									23	0	0	0	20	0	23			0032-0781	1471-9053		WOS:000352494100015	25520404

An increase in the activity of all complexes was observed with increasing pH. A detailed analysis of spectroscopic data together with O-2-evolution experiments using Cp*Ir(6,6'-dihydroxy-2,2'-bipyridine)(OH2)(2+) as a precatalyst indicate that the high catalytic activity is closely connected with transient species (A) that exhibits an absorption band at lambda(max) 590 nm. The formation of this active form is strongly dependent on reaction conditions, and the species was distinctly observed using a small excess of periodate. However, another species absorbing at 600 nm (B), which seems to be a less active catalyst, was also observed and was more prominent at high oxidant concentration. Dynamic light scattering analysis and transmission electron microscopy have identified species B as 120 nm nanoparticles. The ultrafiltration method has revealed that species A can be attributed to particles with size in the range of 0.5-2 nm, possibly small IrOx clusters similar to those described previously by Harriman and co-workers									49	0	0	0	6	0	49			1463-9076	1463-9084		WOS:000337122000017	24549266

The primary photochemistry of a dark adapted leaf was less affected in the presence of Cu, while in a light-adapted leaf the photochemical events were severely impaired by Cu. Analysis of the characteristics of chlorophyll fluorescence induction revealed that the primary target of Cu stress involved the PSII reaction centre in its ability to adapt to high light conditions. Denaturation of PSII occured at 80 mu M Cu resulting in a significant loss of PSII-mediated electron transport under continuous light and a strong inhibition of O-2 evolution. It was also observed that PSI photochemistry, as probed by the photochemical energy storage in far-red light and the kinetics of P-700 photooxidation by strong far-red light, was more tolerant to Cu compared to the PSII activity. Moreover, in Cu-exposed leaves irradiated with high intensity light, the in vivo heat emission yield increased due to the Cu deactivation of photosynthetic energy conservation. Heat release was well correlated with changes in nonphotochemical quenching. copper gradually prevents the adaptation process from a dark-adapted to a light-adapted state with the consequence that all observed photosynthetic activity criteria under steady state conditions in the light become more inefficient.									70	2	0	0	63	2	74			0310-7841			WOS:A1997WM66300010

The structural evolution and chemical composition change during pyrolysis are characterized by thermal gravity (TG), Fourier-transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction (XRD) and field emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM). It is shown that the mass residues of pure BPFR are 27.1 and 8.7 wt.% after being pyrolyzed at 600 and 1000 degrees C for 2 h, respectively. In comparison with the pure BPFR, the mass residue of B2O3 modified BPFR is obviously higher, with the values of 72.9 and 39.7 wt.% at 600 degrees C and 1000 degrees C, respectively. The results of FT-IR prove the degradation and failure of the resin matrix are mainly resulted from the fracture of methylene and the release of small molecules. The XRD characterization shows the residues are amorphous carbon and B2O3. FE-SEM exhibits the melting B2O3 layer formed on the surface of the samples which could prevent oxygen from diffusing into composites during oxidation to some extent.					5th International Symposium on Advance Ceramics (ISAC) / 3rd International Symposium on Advanced Synthesis and Processing Technology for Materials (ASPT)5th International Symposium on Advance Ceramics (ISAC) / 3rd International Symposium on Advanced Synthesis and Processing Technology for Materials (ASPT)	DEC 09-12, 2013DEC 09-12, 2013	Japan Soc Promot Sci; Wuhan Univ Technol; Adv Inst Mat Sci; Ceram Soc Japan; Chinese Ceram Soc; Japan Inst Metals & Mat; Japan Soc Powder & Powder Metallurgy; Peoples Republ China, Minist Educ; Wuhan Univ Technol, State Key Lab Adv Technol Mat Synthesis & Proc; 124th Comm Adv Ceram MatJapan Soc Promot Sci; Wuhan Univ Technol; Adv Inst Mat Sci; Ceram Soc Japan; Chinese Ceram Soc; Japan Inst Metals & Mat; Japan Soc Powder & Powder Metallurgy; Peoples Republ China, Minist Educ; Wuhan Univ Technol, State Key Lab Adv Technol Mat Synthesis & Proc; 124th Comm Adv Ceram Mat	Wuhan, PEOPLES R CHINAWuhan, PEOPLES R CHINA	2	0	0	0	0	0	2			1013-9826		978-3-03835-130-6	WOS:000347883400055

However, its capacitive performance has been rarely studied due to the intrinsic low conductivity and poor stability. Here, we report an asymmetric supercapacitor with excellent electrochemical capacity based on an ultrathin carbon shell entrapped Co-doped CoO heterostructure (CoO/Co@C). The metallic conductivity and mesoporous configuration make the as-prepared CoO/Co@C deliver a dramatic specific capacitance of 2165.7 F g(-1) at a scan rate of 10 mV s(-1). Besides the contribution to double-layer capacitance, more importantly, the amorphous carbon shell effectively prevents the CoO/Co heterostructure from further oxidation, thus resulting in a significantly improved long-term storage stability in air. An asymmetric supercapacitor cell fabricated using CoO/Co@C and active carbon achieves a maximum energy density of 146.3 W h kg(-1) at a power density of 1800 W kg(-1), and the maximum of 27000 W kg(-1) can be obtained with a remaining energy density of 63.0 W h kg(-1). The easy preparation, high performance, and excellent cycling stability of the CoO/Co@C nanocomposite make it a promising material for catalyst and battery applications.									41	4	0	0	1	0	42			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000454251000029

While ligand exchange is known to enable modification of the band structure, its crucial role in water splitting efficiency is not yet fully understood. Here, ligand-engineered manganese oxide cocatalyst nanoparticles (MnO NPs) on bismuth vanadate (BiVO4) anodes are first demonstrated, and a remarkably enhanced photocurrent density of 6.25 mA cm(-2) is achieved. It is close to 85% of the theoretical photocurrent density (approximate to 7.5 mA cm(-2)) of BiVO4. Improved photoactivity is closely related to the substantial shifts in band edge energies that originate from both the induced dipole at the ligand/MnO interface and the intrinsic dipole of the ligand. Combined spectroscopic analysis and electrochemical study reveal the clear relationship between the surface modification and the band edge positions for water oxidation. The proposed concept has considerable potential to explore new, efficient solar water splitting systems.									24	2	0	0	1	0	25			2198-3844			WOS:000447632000022	30356939

Scanning electron microscope and X-ray diffraction were used to characterize the morphology and crystal phase of the modified electrode. Cyclic voltammetry, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, as well as ARG degradation and accelerated life tests were employed to investigate the performance of the electrode. The effect of BS-12 on the performance of the electrode was also studied. The results showed that BS-12 could significantly refine the grain size, increase the specific surface area, and improve the oxygen evolution potential and charge transfer rate. The catalytic performance and stability of Ti/PbO2 electrode could be effectively improved by the modification with proper amount of BS-12. For the most optimal electrode (PbO2-BS-12 (0.1)), the decolorization rate of ARG could reach 85.1% after 60 minutes electrolysis, and the accelerated service life was 138. 5 hours, which was more than 1. 4 times that of PbO2 electrode (96 h).									0	3	0	0	0	0	3			0253-987X			INSPEC:17644385

In order to observe the effects of chemistry-transport coupling on ignition and instability in a cool diffusion flame, diffusion flames of n-heptane and pure oxygen are sensi-tized by ozone in a counterflow burner. First, it is found from experimental observations that the immediate addition of ozone to the oxidizer side of a frozen flow either initiates a cool diffusion flame or triggers a two-stage ignition into a hot flame. Second, a cool flame near its extinction limit can be destabilized by a perturbation of the fuel mole fraction, eventually leading to flame extinction. The recorded flame chemi-luminescence signals reveal repeated flame oscillations before extinction. Next, details of the transient dynamics of near-limit cool diffusion flames are explored through numerical calculations by adopting the same perturbation method. Experimental observations of unsteady flame initiation and instability are simulated, and it is found that the ignition process is highly sensitive to the perturbed ozone mole fraction and that the ignition delay times in a counterflow configuration are significantly affected by the diffusive transport of species with high concentration. The instability mechanism of a cool flame is found to be distinct from that of diffusive-thermal instability. The results show that the instability behavior of a cool flame is a thermokinetic instability, which is triggered and controlled by the chemical kinetics associated with the OH radical population in the negative temperature coefficient chemical kinetic regime coupled with heat production and loss.

The optical absorption edge is substantially redshifted to the visible region due to the induced impurity states within the band gap after doping. However, the monodoping generally comes with the compensating defects, which decreases the photo-catalytic efficiency. Fortunately, the charge compensated combinations, such as ((C@O/TM@Ti), (2N@2O/TM@Ti) and (2C@2O/TM@Sr), TM = Mo, W) could overcome the shortage of monodoping case. And the band-edge alignment confirms that the water redox potentials lie between the highest occupied and lowest unoccupied states for the C@O/TM@Ti and 2N@2O/TM@Ti models, which guarantees their visible-light photocatalytic activity. Although the highest occupied states of 2C@2O/TM@Sr cases are higher than the oxygen evolution potential, the conduction band minimum still keeps strong reduction capability. Furthermore, the formation energy of defect indicates that the codoping can increase the doping concentration of C for C@O/TM@Ti cases under O-rich condition and C@O/W@Ti case under O-poor condition.

Agent-based modeling is a specific discrete-based hybrid modeling approach that allows simulating the role of diversity in cell populations as well as within each individual cell; it has therefore become a powerful modeling method widely used by computational cancer researchers. Many aspects of tumor morphology including phenotype-changing mutations, the adaptation to microenvironment, the process of angiogenesis, the influence of extracellular matrix, reactions to chemotherapy or surgical intervention, the effects of oxygen and nutrient availability, and metastasis and invasion of healthy tissues have been incorporated and investigated in agent-based models. In this review, we introduce some of the most recent agent-based models that have provided insight into the understanding of cancer growth and invasion, spanning multiple biological scales in time and space, and we further describe several experimentally testable hypotheses generated by those models. We also discuss some of the current challenges of multiscale agent-based cancer models. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

The structure and physicochemical properties of the photocatalyst were characterized by XRD, EDS, XPS, FTIR, Photoluminescence (PL), and UV-vis (DRS). The results indicate that copper doping contributes to the formation of impurity level and appropriate oxygen vacancy. Differing from separate citric acid complexation with metal ions, biomass intervention in preparation process can help adjust the crystal structure and surface structure of catalyst, which makes the diffraction angle and unit cell change and simultaneously modulates surface oxygen defects. Furthermore, some organic functional groups from biomass residue on the surface act as photosensitizer, so that the M-LaCo0.7Cu0.3O3 markedly absorbs the visible light and shows higher absorbance than LaCo0.7Cu0.3O3 and LaCoO3. Consequently, M-LaCo0.7Cu0.3O3 exhibits the highest rate of photocatalytic hydrogen production (1.13 mmol h (1) g (1)). This research provides a new way for designing and developing visible-light active materials using biomass. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

The ghost moth Thitarodes armoricanus is distributed in the Tibetan Plateau at an average elevation of approximate 4 km above sea level and has probably evolved a superior capacity to tolerate low oxygen levels. In this study, transcriptome analysis using high-throughput RNA-seq revealed common and different adaptation strategies of T. armoricanus in response to hypoxia (11% O-2) or anoxia. T. armoricanus adopted three common strategies for adaptation to hypoxia or anoxia: Up-regulated signal transduction pathways essential for cellular survival, strengthened cell and organelle structure and activity, and activated immune system. Under hypoxia, T. armoricanus might develop a strategy to adapt to hypoxia by suppressing TCA, oxidative phosphorylation pathways, and hypoxanthine catabolism. T. armoricanus larvae kept active under hypoxia but became coma under anoxia, probably relating to up-regulated or suppressed dopamine synthesis pathway. Furthermore, the HIF system seemed not to be essential for regulating the hypoxic and anoxic responses of this insect in Tibetan Plateau.

In particular, the synthesized electrocatalysts were labeled CoCuFe-LDH, ZnNiFe-LDH, ZnCoFe-LDH, ZnCuFe-LDH, and CoGaFe-LDH. The electrocatalysts were thoroughly characterized by means of Ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy (UV-Vis), N-2 adsorption/desorption, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). We analyzed the changes in the electronic structures, changes in the surface area, and the oxygen vacancies, respectively. X-ray diffraction (XRD) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) showed that the materials had the hydrotalcite-like structure typical of LDHs. Electrochemical results indicated that the best electrocatalyst was the CoGaFe-LDH achieving an overpotential of 369.9 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) and a Tafel slope of 64.8 mV dec(-1) in alkaline conditions (KOH 1 M). Additionally, this material displayed a charge transfer resistance (R-ct) of 30.1 omega cm(2). Electrochemical measurements indicated that the materials containing Zn2+ exhibit low kinetics; whilst materials with Co2+ or Ga3+ yield the best performances. The catalytic activity of the CoGaFe-LDH can be attributed to the decrease of the R-ct caused by electronic effects due to the addition of the Ga3+, lowering the thermodynamic barriers and thus enhancing the electron transfer. This work opens the door for a new approach to design efficient multimetallic catalysts based on the transition metals for WOR.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0				2046-2069		WOS:000807384000001	35754915	
J	Oja, Vello; Laisk, Agu								Time- and reduction-dependent rise of photosystem II fluorescence during microseconds-long inductions in leaves								PHOTOSYNTHESIS RESEARCH				145	3			209	225		10.1007/s11120-020-00783-2		SEP 2020		SEP 2020	2020	Lettuce (Lactuca sativa) and benth (Nicotiana benthamiana) leaves were illuminated with 720 nm background light to mix S-states and oxidize electron carriers. Green-filtered xenon flashes of different photon dose were applied and O(2)evolution induced by a flash was measured. After light intensity gradient across the leaf was mathematically considered, the flash-induced PSII electron transport (= 4 center dot O(2)evolution) exponentially increased with the flash photon dose in any differential layer of the leaf optical density. This proved the absence of excitonic connectivity between PSII units. Time courses of flash light intensity and 680 nm chlorophyll fluorescence emission were recorded. While with connected PSII the sigmoidal fluorescence rise has been explained by quenching of excitation in closed PSII by its open neighbors, in the absence of connectivity the sigmoidicity indicates gradual rise of the fluorescence yield of an individual closed PSII during the induction. Two phases were discerned: the specific fluorescence yield immediately increased fromF(o)to 1.8F(o)in a PSII, whose reaction center became closed; fluorescence yield of the closed PSII was keeping time-dependent rise from 1.8F(o)to about 3F(o), approaching the flash fluorescence yieldF(f) = 0.6F(m)during 40 mu s. The time-dependent fluorescence rise was resolved from the quenching by(3)Car triplets and related to protein conformational change. We suggest thatQ(A)reduction induces a conformational change, which by energetic or structural means closes the gate for excitation entrance into the central radical pair trap-efficiently whenQ(B)cannot accept the electron, but less efficiently when it can.									5	0	0	0	3	0	5			0166-8595	1573-5079		WOS:000568630800001	32918663

Herein, a hierarchical N, S-codoped porous carbon-based catalyst (ZFP-800) coupled with abundant FeS/ZnS heterojunctions was facilely prepared via direct pyrolysis of a Ferrocene-crosslinked pyrrole hydrogel composited with zeolitic imidazolate framework-8 (ZIF-8) templates. Compared with the heterojunction-free catalytic activity, the ZFP-800 catalytic activity was significantly higher in pH-universal ranges. Moreover, the ZFP-800 exhibited competitive ORR performance to commercial Pt/C (20%) in various electrolytes, in terms of onset (E-onset), half-wave potentials (E-1/2), limiting current density (J(L)), durability, and methanol immunity. For instance, it exhibited super ORR catalytic activity on Eonset and E-1/2, and exceeded that of the benchmark Pt/C in both the alkaline and neutral media. Furthermore, the application of ZFP-800 as a cathode catalyst in a home-made Zn-air battery demonstrated its operation capability in ambient conditions with a competitive performance on the specific energy density (828 mA.h.g(Zn)(-1)), maximum discharge power density (205.6 mW.cm(-2)), rate performance, and the long-term stability (188 h at 5 mA.cm(-2)). This study can facilitate the development of advanced heterojunction-based materials for renewable energy applications. (C) 2021 Elsevier Inc.

The composite samples, synthesized by a sol-gel assisted photo-deposition method, gave higher visible light absorption through Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR), larger BET surface area and hindered recombination of charge carrier. Highest H-2 evolution rate of 17200 ppm h(-1) gcat(-1) was obtained over 0.5%Au-loaded WO3/TiO2 which was 4.46 and 5.89 folds higher than WO3/TiO2 and TiO2, respectively. This divulges that constructing WO3/TiO2 Z-scheme hetero-junction adjusted redox potential, while decorating plasmonic Au-NPs enables faster charges separation with higher visible-light absorption through SPR, resulting in superior H-2 production. In addition, both water splitting and photocatalytic glycerol reforming contributed towards excellent H-2 formation. The apparent quantum yield of 28.3% (lambda - 420 nm) was attained and catalyst prevailed photo-stability for H-2 evolution in cyclic runs. This study provides new insight about constructing plasmonic assisted Z-scheme assembly for solar fuels production.									66	2	0	0	4	0	66			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000498641500006

Herein, we designed phosphorus-doped NiMoO4 nanorods (P-NiMoO4) by using a facile hydrothermal method and subsequent low-temperature phosphorization treatment. Phosphorus doping played an indispensable role in significantly improving electronic conductivity and the Li+ diffusion kinetics of NiMoO4 materials. Experimental investigation and density functional theory calculation demonstrated that phosphorus doping can expand the interplanar spacing and alter electronic structures of NiMoO4 nanorods. Meanwhile, the introduced phosphorus dopant can generate some oxygen vacancies on the surface of NiMoO4, which can accelerate Li+ diffusion kinetics and provide more active site for lithium storage. As excepted, P-NiMoO4 electrode delivered a high specific capacity (1,130 mAh.g(-1) at 100 mA.g(-1) after 100 cycles), outstanding cycling durability (945 mAh.g(-1) at 500 mA.g(-1) over 200 cycles), and impressive rate performance (640 mAh.g(-1) at 2,000 mA.g(-1)) for lithium ion batteries (LIBs). This work could provide a potential strategy for improving intrinsic conductivity of transition metal oxides as high-performance anodes for LIBs.									29	1	0	0	0	0	29			1998-0124	1998-0000		WOS:000643200100010

Such a unique artistic effect teaches us that the imperfection in one aspect may result in a great aesthetics in another aspect. The existence of structural defects in nanomaterials (substitutional impurities and vacancies) endows them with diverse and fascinating physicochemical properties, such as optical properties and redox reaction capabilities. Therefore, defect engineering of controllably regulating the types and concentrations of defects in nanoparticles has been paid great attention in nanosynthetic chemistry for tailoring the performances of nanomaterials for diversified practical applications, such as biomedical applications.Mesoporous silica nanoparticles (MSNs) have been extensively applied as nanocarriers in biomedicine, due to their well-defined pore structure and particle morphology, extraordinarily large specific surface area and pore volume, tunable pore size, and framework composition. These nanoparticles have been considered as promising candidates for application in multiple therapeutic or diagnostic applications, by acting as drug carriers or supports for functional materials. The synthesis of MSN is usually based on sol-gel chemistry according to a bottom-up approach in a hydrothermal environment, where the silica precursor tetraethoxysilane molecules condense with each other and -Si-O-Si- bonds form consequently, under the assistance of surfactants as structural-directing agents, finally resulting in the formation of a mesoporous nanostructure. Accompanying the pore structure evolution, which has been being the major focus in the MSNs synthesis and application in the past decades, alternatively, the composition of MSN framework can also be elaborately engineered for the material functionalization and the application broadenings of MSNs, facilely by properly regulating the experimental conditions and reactants. Especially, the defect engineering of MSNs has been extensively explored very recently for broadening biomedical applications of these nanocarriers.In the last several years, our laboratory has developed three general strategies to engineer various functional chemical constituents in the MSN framework as structural defects, conferring the nanocarriers with multiple additional functions: (1) doping metal element M (M = Fe, Cu, Mn, Mg, Ca) in silica to form a -Si-O-M- metal silicate hybrid framework; (2) hybridizing organic group R (R = thioether, ethane, phenylene) in silica to fabricate a -Si-R-Si- molecularly organic-inorganic hybrid framework; (3) creating oxygen vacancies in silica by forming an oxygen-deficient framework abundant with -Si-Si- bonds. These material-engineering approaches have led to the generation of numbers of structural defects in the pristine silsesquioxane framework of MSNs, making these "defective nanoparticles" capable of presenting various unique physicochemical properties benefiting biomedical applications, such as triggered biodegradability for controlled drug release; catalytic performance for triggering in vivo chemical reactions generating therapeutic effects; paramagnetism for enabling magnetic resonance imaging; luminescent property for cell imaging, etc. In this Account, we will provide a concise and concentrated summary on the advances in the preparation of defective MSNs mainly in our laboratory, as well as the therapeutic and diagnostic applications of these versatile nanosystems, hoping to provide more inspirations to future nanomedicine design.									7	0	0	0	0	0	7				2643-6728		WOS:000692032300003

In comparison with the experiment with individual catalyst or H2O2, a prominent enhancement of performance was achieved by the synergetic effect of g-C3N4 and H2O2. Experimental parameters like the H2O2 dosage and reaction temperature were optimized, and the catalyst exhibited excellent application universality for various concentration and different dyes. By physicochemical characterizations, the modification or doping with oxygen-containing groups on carbon nitride framework was demonstrated. We proposed a possible mechanism that the doping level trapped thermo-excited electrons to promote the separation of electrons and holes. On the other hand H2O2 was reduced by the excited electron to produce hydroxyl radical. The quenching experiment suggested the holes and hydroxyl radical were the main active species, thus verifying the synergetic effect of g-C3N4 and H2O2. Additionally, the superior stability and reusability were also proved by the successive five cycles, where the activity was even gradually improved with the increase of cycle number.

Water contact angle measurements revealed that benzothiophene-sulfone-based conjugated polymers display better water compatibility and adsorption, and the synergic effect of better hydrophilic surface and higher surface area of N-PDBT-O might eventually lead to more exposed active sites in comparison to linear L-PDBT-O in the H-2 evolution suspension system. The hydrophilicity-controlled strategy could be applied to design of other network conjugated microporous polymer photocatalysts in an attempt to improve the activity.									20	0	0	0	0	0	20			1022-1336	1521-3927		WOS:000461871900003	30556197

Maximum respiration occurred in 10 muM sulfide. and continued more slowly up to concentrations as high as 60 muM Sulfide oxidation was coupled to adenosine triphosphate (ATP) synthesis, as shown by firefly luciferase luminescence and by measurement of the mitochondrial membrane electrochemical gradient. Synthesis of ATP required low, steady-state concentrations of sulfide (<5 muM), which were maintained by use of a syringe pump. The ratio of consumed O-2 to sulfide changed at low sulfide and O-2 concentrations, indicating alternative metabolic reactions and products. In low concentrations of sulfide, presumably most similar to physiological, the O-2/sulfide ratio was 0.75. This is the first report of sulfide oxidation linked to ATP synthesis in any organism not specifically adapted to a sulfide-rich environment. We suggest that this may be a widespread mitochondrial trait, and that it is consistent with the hypothesis that mitochondria originated from sulfide-oxidizing symbionts.

In this study, we report mechanical properties of polycrystalline as well as single crystal MoS2 containing defects and dopant atoms. To investigate mechanical properties we adopted computational approach using classical molecular dynamics (MD) simulation. Our calculated mechanical properties such as tensile strength, Young's modulus of single-crystal MoS2 are in good agreement with the existing literature and alter with the appearance of GBs and defects. Polycrystalline MoS2 samples exhibit GB strengthening i.e., Hall-Petch effects. A detailed investigation of a specific type of GB tilted sample also shows GBs insensitive fracture behavior. A small amount of sulfur vacancy and oxygen doping (<2%) exhibit ductility in the sample at the expense of failure strength. We also notice local plastic deformation which yields ductility in the sample. Our present study shows the detailed mechanism behind the plastic deformation behavior of single as well as polycrystalline sample.									6	0	0	0	1	0	5			0022-3697	1879-2553		WOS:000586405300052

Luminescence emitted by the symbiotic bacteria provides light for the squid in a behavior termed counter-illumination, which allows the squid to mask its shadow amidst downwelling moonlight. Although this association is beneficial, light generated from the bacteria requires large quantities of oxygen to maintain this energy-consuming reaction. Therefore, we examined the vascular network within the light organ of juveniles of E. tasmanica with and without V. fischeri. Vessel type, diameter, and location of vessels were measured. Although differences between symbiotic and aposymbiotic squid demonstrated that the presence of V. fischeri does not significantly influence the extent of vascular branching at early stages of symbiotic development, these finding do provide an atlas of blood vessel distribution in the organ. Thus, these results provide a framework to understand how beneficial bacteria influence the development of a eukaryotic closed vascular network and provide insight to the evolutionary developmental dynamics that form during mutualistic interactions.									1	0	0	0	1	0	1			1077-8306	1744-7410		WOS:000444542500005	30853777

To address this, we employed a wet impregnation approach to anchor single platinum atoms onto holy carbon nitride nanosheets (PtSA-HCNNS). The X-ray absorption fine structure and density functional theory calculations illustrated that PtSA-HCNNS was equipped with Pt-N4 coordination, which was favorable for oxygen absorption and the generation of reactive oxidation species. As a result, PtSA-HCNNS exhibited significantly enhanced photocatalytic activity for evolving reactive species and degrading herbicide (halosulfuron-methyl) than pristine GCN and Pt cluster-decorated GCN. In addition, PtSA-HCNNS was capable of simultaneously removing five commonly used sulfonylurea herbicides and reducing their phytotoxicity toward soybean seedlings. This work offers a facile approach to developing high-performance porous carbon nitride with single Pt doping for sustainable photocatalytic purification.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000817049800001

In this work, Ni2P/g-C3N4 composite photocatalyst was synthesized using a simple in -situ hydrothermal method by one step. Benefiting from the excellent light trapping, efficient transfer of charge carriers and strong stability of Ni2P nanoparticles, as well as the stable interface contact between Ni2P and g-C3N4, the Ni2P/g-C3N4 exhibit greatly enhanced H-2 evolution performance during photocatalytic water splitting. The optimized H-2 evolution rate can reach 3344 mu mol h(-1) g(-1) over 17.5 wt% Ni2P/g-C3N4, which is 68.2 times greater than that of pure g-C3N4 and even much greater than that of 15 wt% Pt/g-C3N4. The apparent quantum efficiency (QE) is about 9.1% under 420 nm monochromatic. The enhancement mechanism was demonstrated in detail by transient photocurrent responses, photoluminescence spectra and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy.

Experiments were performed at laboratory scale using an asymmetric electrode configuration. The kinetic relation to the cell voltage was analyzed by a stepped linear scan voltammetry at various iron oxide concentrations up to 15 wt%. Complementary gas analysis allowed the derivation of the oxygen production yield. The obtained results show an electronic contribution to the overall conduction. This contribution diminishes in proportion with increasing iron oxide concentration. Charge transfer at the anode is accomplished by the oxidation of ferrous iron ions and of oxide anions. Conditions for the electrochemical charge transfer to occur solely by the oxidation of oxide anions exist for a limited cell voltage range at iron oxide concentrations of less than 10 wt%. For these concentrations a mass transfer limitation of oxide anions was detected with increasing cell voltage. However, a limit of the total current is absent as ferrous iron participates to the anode charge transfer at cell voltages above the mass transfer limitation of oxide ions.

J	Angeletos, T.; Chroneos, A.; Londos, C. A.					Chroneos, Alex/0000-0002-2558-495X			Infrared studies of the evolution of the CIOI(Si-I) defect in irradiated Si upon isothermal anneals								JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS				119	12					125704	10.1063/1.4945110				MAR 28 2016	2016	Carbon-oxygen-self-interstitial complexes were investigated in silicon by means of Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. Upon irradiation, the CiOi defect (C-3) forms which for high doses attract self-interstitials (Si(I)s) leading to the formation of the CiOi(Si-I) defect (C-4) with two well-known related bands at 939.6 and 1024 cm(-1). The bands are detectable in the spectra both in room temperature (RT) and liquid helium (LH) temperature. Upon annealing at 150 degrees C, these bands were transformed to three bands at 725, 952, and 973 cm(-1), detectable only at LH temperatures. Upon annealing at 220 degrees C, these bands were transformed to three bands at 951, 969.5, and 977 cm(-1), detectable both at RT and LH temperatures. Annealing at 280 degrees C resulted in the transformation of these bands to two new bands at 973 and 1024 cm(-1). The latter bands disappear from the spectra upon annealing at 315 degrees C without the emergence of other bands in the spectra. Considering reaction kinetics and defect metastability, we developed a model to describe the experimental results. Annealing at 150 degrees C triggers the capturing of SiIs by the C-4 defect leading to the formation of the CiOi(Si-I)(2) complex. The latter structure appears to be bistable: measuring at LH, the defect is in configuration CiOi(Si-I)(2) giving rise to the bands at 725, 952, and 973 cm(-1), whereas on measurements at RT, the defect converts to another configuration CiOi(Si-I)(2)* without detectable bands in the spectra. Possible structures of the two CiOi(Si-I)(2) configurations are considered and discussed. Upon annealing at 220 degrees C, additional SiIs are captured by the CiOi(Si-I)(2) defect leading to the formation of the CiOi(Si-I)(3) complex, which in turn on annealing at 280 degrees C converts to the CiOi(Si-I)(4) complex. The latter defect anneals out at 315 degrees C, without being accompanied in the spectra by the growth of new bands.

The influence of europium ions on structural behavior of the lead-borate glass ceramics has been investigated using infrared spectroscopy and DFT calculations. The addition of europium ions into the host glass ceramics matrix leads to an increase of the glass network polymerization due to the replacement of B-O-B bonds by the more resistant B-O-Pb bonds. The structural evolution of the studied glass ceramics with the gradual increase of the europium oxide content up to 50 mol% Could be explained by considering that the excess of oxygen may be accommodated by the formation of [PbO4] structural units. Then, the formation of different ionic complexes of the lead ions will decrease the rate of crystal growth and the conversion of the glass into crystalline material becomes more difficult, in agreement to the X-ray data.

Here the authors design a two-dimensional interplanar heterojunction with in situ hydroxyl radical generation under ultrasound irradiation, showing anti-cancer activity in preclinical models.Limited substrates content is a major hurdle dampening the antitumor effect of catalytic therapy. Herein, a two-dimensional interplanar heterojunction (FeOCl/FeOOH NSs) with center dot OH generation under ultrasound irradiation is fabricated and utilized for catalytic cancer therapy. This interplanar heterojunction is prepared through replacing chlorine from iron oxychloride with hydroxyl. Benefiting from the longer hydroxyl bond length and enhanced affinity with water, the alkali replacement treatment integrates interplanar heterojunction synthesis and exfoliation in one step. In particular, a build-in electric field facilitated Z-scheme interplanar heterojunction is formed due to the aligning Fermi levels. The holes on the valence band of FeOCl have great ability to catalyze O-2 evolution from H2O, meanwhile, the generated O-2 is immediately and directly reduced to H2O2 by the electrons on the conductive band of FeOOH. The self-supplying H2O2 ability guarantees efficient center dot OH generation via the Fenton-like reaction catalyzed by FeOCl/FeOOH NSs, which exhibits excellent anti-tumor performance.									4	0	0	0	2	0	4				2041-1723		WOS:000790385800001	35504879

Herein, we report on tailoring the crystalline structure of g-C3N4 by avoiding the formation of incompletely reacted N-rich intermediates and selective breaking the hydrogen bonds between the layers of g-C3N4 simultaneously. The obtained layer plane ordered porous carbon nitride (LOP-CN) material shows efficient photocatalytic H-2 generation performance. The highest H-2 evolution rate achieved is 53.8 mu mol under lambda >= 400 nm light irradiation, which is 7.4 times higher than that of g-C3N4 prepared by convention thermal polycondensation. The substantially boosted photocatalytic activity is mainly ascribed to the efficient charge separation on long-range atomic order layer plane and the extended visible light harvesting ability. This work highlights the importance of crystalline structure tailoring in improving charge separation and light absorption of g-C3N4 photocatalyst for boosting its photocatalytic H-2 evolution activity.

J	Mergelsberg, Mario; Egle, Valentin; Boll, Matthias								Evolution of a xenobiotic degradation pathway: formation and capture of the labile phthaloyl-CoA intermediate during anaerobic phthalate degradation								MOLECULAR MICROBIOLOGY				108	6			614	626		10.1111/mmi.13962				JUN 2018	2018	Xenobiotic phthalates are industrially produced onthe annual million ton scale. The oxygen-independent enzymatic reactions involved in anaerobic phthalate degradation have only recently been elucidated. In vitro assays suggested that phthalate is first activated to phthaloyl-CoA followed by decarboxylation to benzoyl-CoA. Here, we report the heterologous production and characterization of the enzyme initiating anaerobic phthalate degradation from Aromatoleum aromaticum': a highly specific succinyl-CoA:phthalate CoA transferase (SPT, class III CoA transferase). Phthaloyl-CoA formed by SPT accumulated only to sub-micromolar concentrations due to the extreme lability of the product towards intramolecular substitution with a half-life of around 7 min. Upon addition of excess phthaloyl-CoA decarboxylase (PCD), the combined activity of both enzymes was drastically shifted towards physiologically relevant benzoyl-CoA formation. In conclusion, a massive overproduction of PCD in phthalate-grown cells to concentrations >140 M was observed that allowed for efficient phthaloyl-CoA conversion at concentrations 250-fold below the apparent K-m-value of PCD. The results obtained provide insights into an only recently evolved xenobiotic degradation pathway where a massive cellular overproduction of PCD compensates for the formation of the probably most unstable CoA ester intermediate in biology.									13	0	0	0	10	0	13			0950-382X	1365-2958		WOS:000434978300003	29645305

The same powder with surface-deposited palladium (0.033%) shows a considerable absorption capacity. The maximum enthalpy of absorption was -517 J g-1. Kinetic analysis of the absorption process shows different rate constants in the first and subsequent hydridings and that absorption takes place in several distinct stages. The activation energies of absorption are relatively small, below 62 kJ mol-1, except for higher values in narrow temperature intervals at the beginning and end of the process. At hydrogen-saturated samples hydride phases are indicated at temperatures below 80-degrees-C. By a method of dehydriding of the hydride by oxygen in air at temperatures of 150-160-degrees-C, leading to water formation and heat evolution, the ratios H/Ta and H/Pd were determined in several experiments. Depending on the degree of saturation of the hydrides, H/Ta ratios from 4.7 to 20.0 were found, while the H/Pd ratios varied from 8 x 10(3) to 4 x 10(4). X-Ray analysis shows that hydriding changes the structure of the powder. The absorption is to be ascribed to the hydrogen spillover effect through palladium.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			0360-3199			WOS:A1994NZ76800005

Cerebral ischemia is followed by an inflammatory reaction that plays a role in the evolution of the tissue damage. We studied whether COX-2 is induced after cerebral ischemia and if so, whether such expression contributes to ischemic brain damage. The middle cerebral artery was occluded in rats, and the ischemic area was sampled for analysis 3-96 hr later. COX-2 mRNA was determined by the competitive reverse-transcription PCR. COX-2 mRNA was upregulated in the ischemic hemisphere, but not contralaterally, beginning 6 hr after ischemia. The upregulation reached a maximum at 12 hr, at which time a fivefold induction of the message occurred. Twenty-four hours after ischemia, the concentration of prostaglandin E-2 was elevated in the injured brain by 292+/-57% (n=6). COX-2 immunoreactivity was observed in neurons at the medial edge of the ischemic area. Administration of the COX-2 inhibitor NS-398 attenuated the elevation in prostaglandin E-2 in the postischemic brain and reduced the volume of the infarct by 29+/-6% (p <0.05). Thus, cerebral ischemia leads to upregulation of COX-2 message, protein, and reaction products in the injured hemisphere, The data implicate COX-2 in the mechanisms of delayed neuronal death al the infarct border and provide the rationale for neuroprotective strategies employing COX-2 inhibitors.									640	26	2	0	553	2	674			0270-6474			WOS:A1997WX90300011	9092596

The subtlety of the proposed strategy is all the products from urea enzymolysis are utilized in formation of NH4Ga(OH)(2)CO3 precipitates, and the key for interfacial growth of NH4Ga(OH)(2)CO3 nanotubes is the dynamic match between the rate of CO2 bubble fusion and NH4Ga(OH)(2)CO3 precipitation. The proposed strategy works well for the doped porous Ga2O3 nanotubes. As a proof-of-concept, the porous beta-Ga2O3 and beta-Ga2O3:Cr-0.001 nanotubes are used as photocatalysts or co-catalysts with Pt, for H-2 evolution from water splitting. The H-2 evolution rate of porous beta-Ga2O3 nanotubes reach 39.3 mmol g(-1) h(-1) with solar-to-hydrogen (STH) conversion efficiency of 2.11% (Hg lamp) or 498 mu mol g(-1) h(-1) with STH of 0.03% (Xe lamp) respectively, both about 3 times of beta-Ga2O3 nanoparticles synthesized at pH 9.0 without urease. The Cr-doping enhances the in-the-dark H-2 evolution rate pre-lighted by Hg lamp, and Pt co-catalysis further elevates the H-2 evolution rate, for instance, the H-2 evolution rate of Pt-loaded beta-Ga2O3:Cr-0.001 nanotubes reaches 54.7 mmol g(-1) h(-1) with STH of 2.94% under continuous lighting of Hg lamp and 1062 mu mol g(-1) h(-1) in-the-dark.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1613-6810	1613-6829		WOS:000713878000001	34729918

The well-structured 3D hierarchical flowers were composed of numerous two-dimensional nanosheets, which inherently possess considerable electrochemical active sites, thereby enhancing catalytic activity. NiMo and CoMo binary LDHs, with similar morphology, were also prepared to illustrate the efficiency of the ternary LDH. The results indicate higher electrocatalytic activity for the ternary LDH as compared to binary LDHs under alkaline conditions. The NiCoMo-LDH required an overpotential as low as 202 and 93 mV to deliver a constant anodic and cathodic current density of 10 mA cm(-2) for the OER and HER, respectively. Furthermore, the NiCoMo-LDH exhibited remarkable HER activity, affording a low over potential of 198 mV at a current density of -100 mA cm(-2). Moreover, it could offer a stable current density of 10 mA cm(-2) for overall water splitting at 1.62 V in 1 M KOH with long-term stability for 20 h. The double-layer capacitance (C-dl) value indicated that the NiCoMo-LDH significantly influenced interface conductivity and the electrochemical active surface area. The ternary NiCoMo-LDH electrode yielded low Tafel slope values of 54 and 51 mVdec(-1) for the OER and HER. Owing to the efficient incorporation of Ni, Co, and Mo in a layered structure, synergetic effect, and high electrochemical surface area, the NiCoMoLDH exhibited remarkable electrocatalytic activity. Such eco-friendly ternary LDHs can be used in rechargeable metal-air batteries for industrial applications. (C) 2021 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

J	Hughes, Thomas F.; Friesner, Richard A.								Systematic Investigation of the Catalytic Cycle of a Single Site Ruthenium Oxygen Evolving Complex Using Density Functional Theory								JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY B				115	29			9280	9289		10.1021/jp2026576				JUL 28 2011	2011	The mechanism of water oxidation by a single site ruthenium oxygen evolving complex is investigated using fully unrestricted pseudospectral B3LYP with the effective core potential LACV3P in continuum solvent with some quantum mechanical waters. Guess wave functions have been used that allow greater flexibility in sampling different electronic configurations of the complex. Systematic comparison with experiment is improved using these guesses because they provide a complete analysis of the low energy manifold and help to alleviate the formal disconnect between theory and experiment in assigning Lewis structures for transition metal complexes. In agreement with results from the literature, the challenging 4(e-) and 4H(+) oxidation of water is accomplished using a mechanism that features three proton coupled electron transfers, one electron transfer, one atom proton transfer (APT), and one ligand exchange (LE). Calculations on a large database of ruthenium complexes allows us to benchmark the computation of reduction half potentials and free energies of activation and to investigate systematic ligand variations and their effect on the reaction mechanism. Mean unsigned errors of reduction half potentials in comparison to experiment are generally small (100-200 mV). The APT and LE steps are found to be rate limiting with free energy barriers of 19.27 and 19.53 kcal/mol respectively, which is in excellent agreement with the similar to 20 kcal/mol barrier obtained from experimental rate constants using classical transition state theory.									52	1	0	0	7	0	52			1520-6106			WOS:000292893300037	21678966

The effects of co-reactants and of activating conditions were examined by on-line time-resolved mass spectrometric analysis of effluent streams using rigorous analyses to account for equilibrium effects on measured rates. Ethene co-reactants and the larger hydrocarbons to which it converts on acid sites in H-ZSM-5 led to much faster carburization of exchanged (Mo2O5)(5+) dimers and to shorter induction periods than with pure CH4 reactants, but steady-state pyrolysis rates were unchanged, indicating that CH4 and C2H4 form similar MoCx clusters during carburization of exchanged Mo-oxo precursors. H-2 treatment at 973 K before CH4 reactions led to reduction of Mo6+ species to Mo4+, which carburize faster than (Mo2O5)(5+) precursors during initial contact with CH4. This H-2 pretreatment or the use of CH4 - H-2 reactant mixtures did not influence steady-state pyrolysis rates, once contributions from reverse reactions were taken into account. With pure CH4 streams, (Mo2O5)(5+)- ZSM- 5 converts to active MoCx clusters within zeolite channels via autocatalytic processes, in which higher hydrocarbons, initially formed during initial conversion of MoOx to MoCx structures, lead to faster carburization of downstream catalyst sections. Concurrently, H2O and CO2 formed during this incipient carburization of exchanged (Mo2O5)(5+) and unexchanged MoO3 present in trace amounts inhibit and even prevent carburization and lengthen activation periods. Activation protocols with C2H4 were also successful in the activation of more refractory high-valent metal-oxo species, such as WOx and VOx, exchanged onto H-ZSM-5. The formation of active carbide structures occurred in less than 300 s, instead of 4 ks and 16 ks for VOx and WOx samples, respectively, in pure CH4 reactants. These activation protocols led to VCx - ZSM5 catalysts about three times more active than those activated in pure CH4 reactants.									42	3	0	0	1	0	44			1463-9076	1463-9084		WOS:000226419000015	19785141

Herein is reported the design of an efficient ZnO photoanode deposited with CoOx nanoparticles to achieve a heterojunction and oxygen vacancies. The CoOx nanoparticles with abundant oxygen vacancies were anchored onto the nanorod arrays by spin coating and calcination followed by a solvothermal treatment. CoOx nanoparticles serve the dual function of forming a p-n heterojunction to facilitate the separation of photogenerated carriers, and act as a cocatalyst to decrease water oxidation barrier. Finally, oxygen vacancies increase the number of active redox sites and act as hole traps, enabling their migration to the electrode/electrolyte interface. The composite photoanode exhibits a high incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (76.7% at 350 nm), which is twice that of pristine ZnO, and a photoconversion efficiency of 0.68% (0.73V versus RHE). The current approach can be expanded to fabricate other efficient photocatalysts.									32	1	0	0	0	0	32			1864-5631	1864-564X		WOS:000455584900011	30265451

The implementation is achieved by separating the original fuel jet into two parallel jets which will be used as rich and lean streams. An effort has been made to develop a 13-step reaction mechanism and NOx evolution UDFs (user defined functions) for better understanding the interactions between MILD combustion and fuel-rich/lean technology. The experiment of the reference case (Combustion and Flame 156.9 (2009): 1771-1784) is well reproduced by the present numerical simulation, indicating high reliability of developed models. The validity of the further reduction of NOx emission is assessed by the comparison among inner-fuel-rich (IFR), outer-fuel-rich (OFR), and reference cases resulting from the adjustment of the fuel supply through the two fuel-rich/lean jets. The results show that both IFR and OFR configurations succeed in achieving further reduction of NOx emission as compared with the reference case, which stems from both thermal and fuel paths. Specifically, the decrease of thermal-NO emission originates from the contraction of high-temperature regions (>1800 K), where nearly 94% reduction occurs within the temperature range of 1800 K and 1950 K while only 6% within 1950 K and 2030 K despite their high temperature sensitivity. The reduction of the fuel-NO emission is mainly attributed to the promoted NO reduction on char surface and neutralization with HCN and NH3. Generally, the NOx emission can be minimized by enlarging the equivalence ratio difference between rich and lean jets, and the OFR configuration exhibits a higher potential than the IFR counterparts. However, since a relatively high temperature (1623 K) secondary air was used in the experiment, the maximum NOx reduction potential was limited to only 2.5%.									4	1	0	0	0	0	4			0363-907X	1099-114X		WOS:000483948000001

Enhanced charge transfer (CT) based on the interaction between a noble metal and a semiconductor is a crucial factor influencing the movement of photogenerated electron-hole pairs. Herein, we focus on the recent advances related to plasmon-enhanced noble metals and the semiconductor nature to drive the photocatalytic H-2 production and photodegradation of the organic dye rhodamine B (RhB) under UV and visible light irradiation. Specifically, the combination of concerted catalysis and green nanoengineering strategies to design ZnO-based composite photocatalysts and their decoration with metallic Ag have been realized by the radio frequency (RF) sputtering technique at room temperature. This simultaneity enhances the interface coupling between Ag and ZnO and reduces the energy threshold. The creation of charge transfer in the heterojunction and Schottky barrier changes the photoelectronic properties of the as-synthesized Al-doped ZnO (AZO); afterward, these effects promote the migration, transportation, and separation of photoinduced charge carriers and enhance the light-harvesting efficiency. As a result, the as synthesized AZO-20 hybrid nanostructure exhibits a photocurrent density of 2.5 mA/cm(2) vs Ag/AgCl, which is improved by almost 12 times compared with that of bare ZnO (0.2 mA/cm(2)). The hydrogen evolution rates of AZO-20 were similar to 38 and similar to 24 mu mol/h under UV and visible light exposure, which are almost five- and tenfold higher than those of pristine ZnO, respectively. Additionally, the RhB degradation efficacies of the obtained AZO-20 were greater than almost 97 and 82% under UV and visible light illumination, respectively. The achieved apparent rate constant for the photocatalytic RhB decomposition was 0.014 min(-1), indicating that it is 14-fold than that in pristine ZnO (0.001 min(-1)). Heterostructure AZO photocatalysts possess excellent practical stability in the water-splitting reaction and photocatalytic RhB decomposition, posing as promising candidates in practical works for pollution and energy challenges.									77	1	0	0	9	0	77			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000526609100090	32013392

Characterization measurements including scanning electronic microscopy accompanied by energy dispersive X-rays, X-ray diffraction, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy are used to analyze the microstructure and chemical composition of the coated anode, including the interlayer coating and superficial coating. The electrochemical and electrocatalytic properties of the interlayer and anode surfaces are analyzed using linear sweep voltammetry, cyclic voltammetry, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. Meanwhile, the failure mechanism of the anode coated with the MnO2-WC composite interlayer, and the life-extension mechanism due to introducing the composited interlayer, are determined via accelerated-life tests and a comprehensive failure analysis of the tested samples. The results show that, compared with MnO2, the conductivity of the MnO2-WC interlayer is greatly improved and exhibits higher oxygen evolution potential as well as better electrocatalytic activity. The anodic beta-PbO2 grains deposited on the MnO2-WC interlayer surface become finer, more compact and homogeneous. The MnO2-WC composite interlayer increases the number of surface active sites and promotes the electro-crystallization process of the PbO2 surface coatings, which results in thicker PbO2 coatings. As a result, the Ti/MnO2-WC/beta-PbO2-coated anode shows better electrocatalytic activity and superior stability in this work, and its accelerated life is more than twice that of Ti/beta-PbO2 anodes.

The preparation process involved a solvothermal method for synthesis of bimetallic MOF (Cu-Zn-MOF) and subsequently vulcanization treatment to transform into CuS/ZnS microspheres. The MOF-derived CuS/ZnS microspheres inherited the porous skeleton of the Cu-Zn-MOF precursor, which significantly enhanced the utilization of light and synchronously provided plentiful exposed catalytic active sites. The obtained CuS/ZnS microspheres exhibited excellent photocatalytic activity for hydrogen production via water splitting. The optimized CuS/ZnS photocatalyst demonstrated a H-2-production rate of 310.43 mu mol h(-1) under visible light with an apparent quantum efficiency of 8.5% at 420 nm. Such excellent photocatalytic H-2-evolution activity was ascribed to the interfacial charge transfer from the valence band of ZnS to CuS, which facilitated the efficient electron-hole separation and transportation. This study provides a strategy for the rational design of MOF-derived photocatalysts to dramatically increase H-2 production efficiency.									19	1	0	0	2	0	19			1010-6030			WOS:000474320400003

The X-ray diffraction shows broad peaks with a particle size of similar to 20 nm and a specific surface area of similar to 28 m(2) g(-1). The forbidden band (1.33 eV) is due to Ag+ : d -> d transition, further transition at 4.50 eV is assigned to the charge transfer. The transport properties, measured up to 650 K, indicate intrinsic conductivity: sigma = sigma(o) exp{- 0.24 eV/kT (Omega-cm)(-1)}, supporting a phonon assisted conduction mechanism. An exchange current density of 1.27 mA cm(-2) in Na2SO4 (0.1 M) solution is consistent with the electrochemical stability up to 0.8 V-SCE. The capacitance measurement (C-2 - E) indicates p type conduction, with a flat band potential (E-fb) of 0.26 V-SCE and a holes density (N-A) of 7.38 x 10(19) cm(-3) due to the oxygen insertion in the layered lattice. The electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) data, recorded in the range (1 mHz - Hz), reveals a predominant bulk contribution with a low depletion angle of 3 degrees and a pseudo capacitive behavior. As application, AgCoO2 is tested for the hydrogen production upon visible illumination owing to the potential of its conduction band (-0.83 V-SCE), less cathodic than that of H2O/H-2 (similar to -0.5 V-SCE). H-2 evolution rate of 79 mu mol g(-1) min(-1) is determined at neutral pH with a quantum yield of 1.92% in presence of NO2 as hole scavenger; no Ag deposition was observed after photocatalysis.									8	0	0	0	1	0	8			1369-8001	1873-4081		WOS:000454537700024

At the first step, the specimens were exposed to 5-minutes treatment in a non-isothermal reactor at 900 degrees C at a two directions of grad T. At the second step, a process of defects evolution continued in conventional isothermal furnace (1150 degrees C, 4 h). Depending on the direction of grad T at the first step, the defects evolution process led to the formation of two kinds of the self-organized dislocation structures, which are basically dissipative. A synergetic approach used in this experiment have ensured conditions of non-equilibrium, nonlinearity, instability, and irreversibility by creating the stress and temperature gradients, effects from excess point defects flows, and interactions between Si matrix and impurity atoms. Along with plastic deformation, this joint multi-parameter effect on Si crystal led to the creation of a set of unique structural defects.

TROPICAL PLANT BIOLOGY				14	3			251	266		10.1007/s12042-021-09286-3		MAY 2021		SEP 2021	2021	Plant respiratory burst oxidase homolog (Rboh) are key enzymes for reactive oxygen species (ROS) production in plants. They help in resisting adverse environmental conditions and regulating growth and development. To date, many Rboh family members have been identified in plants, but little is known about Rboh genes in pepper. In this study, seven CaRboh genes and six CaRboh genes were identified in 'Zunla-1 ' and 'CM334 ' pepper genomes, respectively. All CaRboh proteins were predicted to localize to the plasma membrane and were divided into five subfamilies by comparative phylogenetic analysis. A total of fourteen cis-elements were identified in the promoters of CaRboh genes. Synteny analysis of the Rboh proteins of pepper with those of Arabidopsis, tomato, and potato, led to the identification of several orthologous and paralogous genes, which provided further insight into the diversity of the evolutionary characteristics of genes of this family in other plant species. Besides, the expression profiles revealed that CaRbohA, CaRbohB, and CaRbohD genes were highly expressed in all tissues, while CaRbohC, CaRbohF, and CaRbohG genes were expressed at very low levels. The results of physiological indexes and qRT-PCR showed that CaRbohA, CaRbohB, and CaRbohD genes response to stress by mediates H2O2 and O-2(center dot-), and then lead to MDA accumulation, implying that the three genes play an important role in response to abiotic stress. This study has laid a foundation for further understanding of the function of Rboh family genes in pepper.									3	0	0	0	1	0	3			1935-9756	1935-9764		WOS:000649241000001

To fill the knowledge gap, this study proposed a fractional-order advection-dispersion-reaction (fADR) model to quantify the dynamics of dissolved heavy metals, such as manganese (Mn), moving in streams with oxidative precipitation and sorption in storage zones. The fADR model was applied to fit the Mn concentration profiles documented in the literature at the hyporheic flow path scale (0.30m in length), the reach scale (100-3000m), and the basin scale ( similar to 20000 m) at Pinal Creek, Arizona. Numerical results showed that compared with standard transport models such as the OTIS model and the single-rate mass transfer model, the fADR model can better capture the observed plumes at all scales. This is because the space fractional-diffusive term in the fADR model can capture super-diffusive jumps of dissolved metals driven by turbulence at the bedform scale and flooding in a decade-long time scale. Meanwhile, the time fractional derivative term in the fADR model describes complex solute retention due to multiple-rate mass exchange between the mobile zone (stream or the hyporheic flux) and various storage regimes with different properties (such as streambed sediments and stagnant portions in the hyporheic zone). This does not rely on the equilibrium chemistry condition for solutes in storage zones assumed by standard hyporheic-exchange models. In addition, the first-order reaction in the fADR model can efficiently characterize the mass decline of Mn downstream resulting from enhanced Mn oxidation (such as oxidation of MN(II) to +3 or +4 oxidation states) due to the input of streamflow with increased pH and dissolved oxygen and/or groundwater recharge with high dissolved metals into the hyporheic zone. The decoupled super-diffusion and retention for Mn can exhibit scale-dependent behaviors due to the evolution of driving mechanisms, which can be characterized by the parsimonious, phenomenological FDE by adjusting the indexes. Therefore, the application of FDEs helps us to interpret the physical and geochemical processes in streams across scales.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			2190-5444			WOS:000479155600001

The water molecule distal to TyrD, located similar to 4 angstrom away from the phenolic O of TyrD, corresponds to the presence of the tyrosyl radical state. The water molecule proximal to TyrD, in H-bonding distance to the phenolic O of TyrD, corresponds to the presence of the unoxidized tyrosine. The H+ released on oxidation of TyrD is transferred to the proximal water, which shifts to the distal position, triggering a concerted proton transfer pathway involving D2-Arg180 and a series of waters, through which the proton reaches the aqueous phase at D2-His61. The water movement linked to the ejection of the proton from the hydrophobic environment near TyrD makes oxidation slow and quasiirreversible, explaining the great stability of the TyrD(.). A symmetry-related proton pathway associated with tyrosine Z is pointed out, and this is associated with one of the Cl- sites. This may represent a proton pathway functional in the water oxidation cycle.									54	0	0	0	34	0	54			0027-8424			WOS:000319327700046	23599284

Titania nanotubes (TNTs) were synthesized via facile hydrothermal method of different reaction times: 10 h and 48 h. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and BET analysis were conducted to scrutinize the structural morphology of the as-synthesized TNTs. TNTs produced under prolonged reaction exhibited larger tube diameters, but have rather smaller pores. No functionalizations or modifications were made regarding the surface chemistry of the TNTs prior to blending with the spinning dope. Defect-free membranes were attained up to 0.6 wt% addition of TNT10. The measured permeances for all gases tested were profoundly increased with the addition of TNTs. PSF-TNT10 0.4 wt% MMM recorded the highest permeance enhancement (about 150%), with H-2, CO2, O-2 permeance of 269 GPU, 120 GPU, and 26 GPU, respectively, with O-2/N-2, H-2/CH4, CO2/CH4, and CO2/N-2 selectivity remained higher than the neat membrane. TNT48 MMM demonstrated relatively lower fluxes but higher selectivity which ascribed to its smaller internal tube diameter endowing better size-exclusion capability. The TNTs formation mechanisms were discussed to justify the evolution of gas separation performance of TNT-incorporated MMMs. In light of the findings, hydrothermal method can be regarded as a versatile technique for producing TNTs of different morphologies simply by manipulating its reaction parameters. On top of that, TNTs being a low cost material, it holds enormous potential to be widely exploited in gas separation applications. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

There, the g-C3N4 shell is deposited on the surface of as-prepared SrTiO3 nanosphere, and then the MoS2 lamellas grow on the surface of core-shell heterojunction. Evaluated by the hydrogen evolution, the as-prepared MoS2/g-C3N4/SrTiO3 core-shell heterojunction exhibits an obvious photocatalytic enhancement of about similar to 30 folds than single SrTiO3 nanospheres, which can be mainly ascribed to that, the core-shell heterojunction can promote the charge carriers separation efficiently and the Pt-like behavior MoS2 can promote the photo-generated electrons diffusing into water quickly. Additionally, the ultrathin MoS2 lamellas with a mass of edge S atoms can provide sufficient HER active sites and shorten photoelectron transport route to improve photocatalytic stability.

The X-ray diffraction pattern shows narrow peaks of Ag and NiO. The direct optical gap of the sensitizer NiO (1.51 eV) is well matched to the solar spectrum. It acts as n-type semiconductor and the potential of its conduction band (- 0.35 V-SCE), determined from the capacitance measurement, is more negative than the H2O/H-2 level (similar to - 0.3 V-SCE), yielding water reduction under visible light; the photoactivity peaks at pH similar to 13. The excited electrons are transferred to Ag clusters, to reduce water into gaseous hydrogen owing to the low H-2-over-voltage (similar to 160 mu mol). A quantum conversion efficiency of 0.11% is reported under visible light (3.42 x 10(18) photons s(-1)) within similar to 10 min with an evolution rate of 96 mu mol h(-1) mg(-1). The catalyst was tested for several successive photocatalytic cycles, a deactivation effect of similar to 7% per cycle is observed, thus proving its stability and repeatability. The heating of the catalyst under dynamic vacuum at 250 degrees C restores the initial photoactivity.									9	0	0	0	0	0	9			0038-092X			WOS:000456222500064

Herein, a simple, self-assembly synthesis of coral-like 3D porous P-doped g-C3N4 tubes (PCNT) by the combination of pyrolysis and freeze-drying method was reported. Attributed to the integrated merits of 1D tubular structure, 2D nanosheets and phosphorus doping, the as-prepared hollow PCNT exhibits superior photocatalytic activity under visible light irradiation. Owing to their higher specific surface area, enhanced light absorption, and better charge carrier separation and transfer, the maximum apparent photocatalytic hydrogen evolution rate of PCNT is 2020 mu mol g(-1) h(-1), which is about 4.7 folds and 22.4 folds than that of g-C3N4 tubes and pristine bulk g-C3N4, respectively. Moreover, a possible photocatalytic mechanism and nanostructure formation process based on the experimental results are proposed. The novel growth strategy developed here may offer a new avenue for the rational design and synthesis of potentially efficient photocatalyst with 1D/2D integrated nanoarchitecture.									163	18	0	0	20	0	166			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000449444000017

Such an outperforming nonprecious electrocatalyst, nickel telluride (NiTe2), has been fabricated on Ni foam for electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution in extreme pH conditions, viz., 0 and 14. The morphological outcome of the fabricated NiTe2 was directed by the choice of the Te precursor. Nanoflakes (NFs) were obtained when NaHTe was used, and nanowires (NWs) were obtained when Te metal powder with hydrazine hydrate was used. Both NiTe2 NWs and NiTe2 NFs were comparatively screened for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in extreme pH conditions, viz., 0 and 14. NiTe2 NWs delivered current densities of 10, 100, and 500 mA cm(-2) at the overpotentials of 125 +/- 10, 195 +/- 4, and 275 +/- 7 mV in 0.5 M H2SO4. Similarly, in 1 M KOH, overpotentials of 113 +/- 5, 247 +/- 5, and 436 +/- 8 mV were required for the same current densities, respectively. On the other hand, NiTe2 NFs showed relatively poorer HER activity than NiTe2 NWs, which required overpotentials of 193 +/- 7, 289 +/- 5, and 494 +/- 8 mV in 0.5 M H2SO4 for the current densities of 10 and 100 mA cm(-2) and 157 +/- 5 and 335 +/- 6 mV in 1 M KOH for the current densities of 10 and 100 mA cm(-2), respectively. Notably, NiTe2 NWs outperformed the state-of-the-art Pt/C 20 wt % loaded Ni foam electrode of comparable mass loading. The Pt/C 20 wt % loaded Ni foam electrode reached 500 mA cm(-2) at 332 +/- 5 mV, whereas NiTe2 NWs drove the same current density with 57 mV less. These encouraging findings emphasize that a NiTe2 NW could be an alternative to noble and expensive Pt as a nonprecious and high-performance HER electrode for proton-exchange membrane and alkaline water electrolyzers.									56	1	0	0	0	0	56			0020-1669	1520-510X		WOS:000428219500018	29498515

It has been alternatively suggested that HMP activity is inhibited at low pO(2) because the enzyme is then in the relatively inactive nitrosyl form [k(off)/k(on) for NO (0.000008 muM)) much less than k(off)/k(on) for O-2 (0.012 muM) and K-M for O-2 = 30-100 muM]. To resolve this discrepancy, we have directly measured heme-ligand turnover and NADH consumption under various O-2/NO concentrations. We find that, at biologically relevant O-2 concentrations, HMP preferentially binds NO (not O-2), which it then reacts with oxygen to form nitrate (in essence NO- + O-2 --> NO3-. During steady-state turnover, the enzyme can be found in the ferric (FeIII) state. The formation of a heme-bound nitroxyl equivalent and its subsequent oxidation is a novel enzymatic function, and one that dominates the oxygenase activity under biologically relevant conditions. These data unify the mechanism of HMP/NO interaction with those recently described for the nematode Ascaris and mammalian hemoglobins, and more generally suggest that the peroxidase (FeIII)-like properties of globins have evolved for handling of NO.									137	3	0	0	128	0	144			0027-8424			WOS:000170738000019	11517313

Analyzing the carbon and oxygen isotope during the whole-rock carbonate reveals the delta C-13 values in the Yeli Formation range from -7.11 parts per thousand-0.76 parts per thousand (PDB), with the mean value at -2.98 parts per thousand, while the delta O-18 values range of -9.09 parts per thousand- -4.65 parts per thousand with the mean value at -6.12 parts per thousand. The delta C-13 values in the Liangjiashan Formation range of -1.15 parts per thousand-0.3 parts per thousand, and the mean value of -0.57 parts per thousand; the delta O-18 values are -8.76 parts per thousand- -7.48 parts per thousand, and the mean value is -8.06 parts per thousand. The delta C-13 values in the Yell Formation decrease, but at the bottom of the Liangjiashan Formation the values increase steadily. In the middle-upper formation, there is an extended fluctuation between 0- -1.00 parts per thousand. The delta C-13 trend in the studied section is similar to that of the contemporary sections, except that it has much lower delta C-13 values and a more negative excursion. The correlation between the delta C-13 changes and the eustatic events, as well as the sedimentary facies, indicates that in the Tangshan area, the carbon isotope evolution can be attributabled to the processes of the eutrophic sea/oligotrophic sea, the seafloor organism-mediated oxidation in shallow water and the organic reduction after maximum flooding. The changes in the carbon isotope contents were primarily affected by the regional relative sea level changes. Compared to the other coeval data, the Early Ordovician of the Tang shan area is also severely depleted in O-18, with all of the delta O-18 sample values being below -5 parts per thousand, except for one sample with a value of -4.65 parts per thousand. With the ancient seawater having a delta O-18 value of -5.5 parts per thousand (SMOW), it is reasonable to delineate a temperature of less than 37 degrees C.									2	2	0	0	0	0	2			1674-487X	1867-111X		WOS:000328007800005

Herein, one-dimensional (1D) cadmium sulfide (CdS) nanorods are uniformly anchored onto two-dimensional (2D) NiO nanosheets to achieve enhanced photocatalytic hydrogen evolution. The optimized 2D/1D NiO/CdS photocatalyst exhibits a remarkable boosted hydrogen generation rate of 1,300 mu mol h(-1) g(-1) under visible light, which is more than eight times higher than that of CdS nanorods. Moreover, the resultant 5% NiO/CdS composite displays excellent stability over four cycles for photocatalytic hydrogen production. The significantly enhanced photocatalytic activity of the 2D/1D NiO/CdS heterojunction can be attributed to the efficient separation of photogenerated charge carriers driven from the formation of p-n NiO/CdS heterojunction. This study paves a new way to develop 2D p-type NiO nanosheets-decorated n-type semiconductor photocatalysts for photocatalytic applications.									13	1	0	0	0	0	13			2296-2646			WOS:000645275300001	33937197

Genomic multiplicity and functional characterization of the ALOX15 orthologs in the tree shrew								BIOCHIMICA ET BIOPHYSICA ACTA-MOLECULAR AND CELL BIOLOGY OF LIPIDS				1865	2					158550	10.1016/j.bbalip.2019.158550				FEB 2020	2020	The tree shrew (Tupaia belangeri) is a rat-sized mammal, which is more closely related to humans than mice and rats. However, the use of tree shrew to explore the patho-mechanisms of human inflammatory disorders has been limited since nothing is known about eicosanoid metabolism in this mammalian species. Eicosanoids are important lipid mediators exhibiting pro- and anti-inflammatory activities, which are biosynthesized via lipoxygenase and cyclooxygenase pathways. When we searched the tree shrew genome for the presence of cyclooxygenase and lipoxygenase isoforms we found copies of functional COX1, COX2 and LOX genes. Interestingly, we identified four copies of ALOX15 genes, which encode for four structurally distinct ALOX15 orthologs (tupALOX15a-d). To explore the catalytic properties of these enzymes we expressed tupALOX15a and tupALOX15c as catalytically active proteins and characterized their enzymatic properties. As predicted by the Evolutionary Hypothesis of ALOX15 specificity we found that the two enzymes converted arachidonic acid predominantly to 12S-HETE and they also exhibited membrane oxygenase activities. However, their reaction kinetic properties (K-M for arachidonic acid and oxygen, T- and pH-dependence) and their substrate specificities were remarkably different. In contrast to mice and humans, tree shrew ALOX15 isoforms are highly expressed in the brain suggesting a role of these enzymes in cerebral function. The genomic multiplicity and the tissue expression patterns of tree shrew ALOX15 isoforms need to be considered when the results of in vivo inflammation studies obtained in this animal are translated into the human situation.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			1388-1981	1879-2618		WOS:000509816500010	31676437	
J	Jia, Jia; Zhang, Qiqi; Li, Zong; Hu, Xiaoyun; Liu, Enzhou; Fan, Jun								Lateral heterojunctions within ultrathin FeS-FeSe2 nanosheet semiconductors for photocatalytic hydrogen evolution								JOURNAL OF MATERIALS CHEMISTRY A				7	8			3828	3841		10.1039/c8ta11456k				FEB 28 2019	2019	Two-dimensional (2D) layered heterostructures have attracted substantial attention in recent years as promising platforms for the direct conversion of renewable solar energy to chemical fuels due to their unique optoelectronic, transport, and interfacial properties. The rational structural design and tailored synthesis of semiconductor heterojunctions are critical to explore and achieve well-defined photocatalytic systems. Herein, we propose a design strategy for ultrathin 2D FeS-FeSe2 lateral heterostructures to achieve rapid spatial migration of photogenerated charge carriers and to facilitate favorable kinetics of target surface redox reactions for photocatalysis. The resultant composites have superior photocatalytic H-2 generation activity (2071.1 mmol g(-1) h(-1)) without any noble metal as a cocatalyst under sunlight and show marked photocatalytic durability after a continuous test for 20 h under alkaline conditions. In particular, we have found, for the first time, that the irradiated FeS-FeSe2 is active for producing H2O2 by the two-electron reduction of O-2 in the photocatalytic degradation process of phenol solution. A series of mechanistic studies on photocatalysis clearly demonstrates that the pronounced photocatalytic performance of the 2D lateral heterojunction nanosheets could be a result of increased carrier density, longer electron lifetime and higher hole injection efficiency as well as a stepwise two-electron/two-step reduction pathway.									50	1	0	0	6	0	50			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000459331600035

The oxides were obtained at 70 degrees C as precipitate and produced in the him forms on a nickel support by an oxide-slurry painting technique. The study showed that both the electrochemically active area as well as the apparent electrocatalytic activity of the oxide increased significantly with increasing replacement of Fe by Co following maximum with x = 1.5. These properties further enhanced nearly by two-fold with 0.5 mol Mn-substitution in Co1.5Fe1.5O4. 1.0 mol Ni-substitution in the Fe3O4 lattice was also greatly beneficial from the electrocatalytic point of view. In contrast, its substitution (0.1-0.5 mol) in the Co1.5Fe1.5O4 lattice was not. Also, Cu-substitution in the base oxide did not indicate any electrocatalytic effect. The reaction order (p) and the Tafel slope (b) have been observed to vary with the introduction of Co. The electroformation of O-2 on the active electrodes, namely, NiFe2O4, CoFe2O4 and Co1.5Fe1.5O4, exhibited approximately second-order kinetics in OH- concentration.

However, the key mechanism of action in each defect site in the corresponding photocatalytic surface reactions is still unclear. Here, the -C N groups and N vacancies were sequentially introduced into g-C3N4 (Nv-C N-CN) for photocatalytic production of high-value and multifunctional H2O2, and the effect of dual defect sites on the overall photocatalytic conversion process was systematically analyzed. The modification of the dual defect sites forms an electron-rich structure and leads to a more localized charge density distribution, which not only enhances the light absorption and carrier separation capabilities, but also significantly improves the selectivity and activity of H2O2 generation. Importantly, detailed experimental characterizations and theoretical calculations clearly revealed the key role of each defect site in the photocataLytic H2O2 surface reaction mechanism: the N vacancies can effectively adsorb and activate O-2, and the -C N groups facilitate the adsorption of H+, which synergistically promote H2O2 generation. The Nv-C N-CN reached a H2O2 generation rate of 3093 mu moL g(-1)h(-1) and achieved an apparent quantum efficiency of 36.2% at 400 nm, significantly surpassing the previously reported g-C3N4-based photocatalysts. Meanwhile, a solar-to-chemical conversion efficiency of 0.23% was achieved in pure water. Constructing defects and understanding their crucial role provides significant insights into the rational use of defect engineering to design and synthesize highly active catalytic materials for energy conversion and environmental remediation.									38	2	0	0	5	0	39			1754-5692	1754-5706		WOS:000744080100001

However, commonly-used electrolytes, organic compounds, in commercially available lithium-ion batteries are flammable and toxic, which leaves them at the risk of combustion and explosion when being overcharged or short-circuited. In order to solve this problem, much attention has been paid to lithium-ion batteries with aqueous electrolytes, which take low-toxicity and high safety as the prominent advantages. The working voltage, 1.5-2.0 V, indicates their usage mainly in the field of energy storage. Considering the hydrogen and oxygen evolution, conventional anode materials used in commercially available lithium-ion batteries are inconformity for water-based lithium-ion batteries. Therefore, the key to the development of aqueous lithium-ion batteries lies in the selection of anodes. The anode material, LiTi2(PO4)(3), has drawn the attention of researchers due to its advantages such as three-dimensional channel, and appropriate lithium-ion intercalation potential. The synthesis methods of LiTi2(PO4)(3) mainly include high temperature solid-phase calcination, Sol-Gel methods and hydrothermal reaction, etc. To further improve the electrochemical performance of LiTi2(PO4)(3), strategies can be used such as particle nanocrystallization, morphology control, element doping, and carbon-coating, etc. This review focuses on the synthesis and modification of LiTi2(PO4)(3), as well as related research progress. At last, the future development of LiTi2(PO4)(3) as anode material for lithium-ion battery is properly prospected.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1000-324X			WOS:000817167900002

Although the ceria surface is active in catalytic and electrochemical reactions, how its catalytic properties are affected by the surface structure under operating conditions is far from understood. We investigate the structure of the coherently strained CeO2 ultrathin films on yttria-stabilized zirconia (001) single crystals by specular synchrotron x-ray diffraction (XRD) under oxidizing conditions as a first step to study the surface structure in situ. An excellent agreement between the experiment data and the model is achieved by using a "stacks and islands" model that has a two-component roughness. One component is due to the tiny clusters of nanometer scale in lateral dimensions on each terrace, while the other component is due to slightly different CeO2 thickness that span over hundreds of nanometers on neighboring terraces. We attribute the nonuniform thickness to step depairing during the thin film deposition that is supported by the surface morphology results on the microscopic level. Importantly, our model also shows that the polarity of the ceria surface is removed by a half monolayer surface coverage of oxygen. The successful resolution of the ceria surface structure using in situ specular synchrotron XRD paves the way to study the structural evolution of ceria as a fuel cell electrode under catalytically relevant temperatures and gas pressures.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2469-9950	2469-9969		WOS:000387892800010

VLEED quantification of the four-stage Cu3O2 bonding kinetics								SURFACE REVIEW AND LETTERS				8	6			703	734		10.1142/S0218625X0100166X				DEC 2001	2001	Further to the previous part [Surf. Rev. Lett. 8(3/4), 367 (2001)], this part deals with VLEED numerical quantification of the Cu3O2 bond-forming kinetics on the Cu(001) surface. Besides the solution-number certainty that has been ensured, the modeling exercises have enabled the full capacity of VLEED to be explored, revealing that the bond geometry and the elastic potential define the shapes of the VLEED fine-structure features while the inelastic potential contributes to the absolute intensity. VLEED, covering the valence band in energy, is found to be able to collect nondestructive information from the top atomic layer, as the inelastic damping dominates in this region. Except for the bond geometry, dislocation of a single atom in the unit cell produces no feature that can match the VLEED spectral change, indicating the essentiality of the parametrization techniques developed. It is the right premise that it has enabled the four-stage O-Cu(001) reaction kinetics, revealed by VLEED, to be quantified as the evolution of the CuO2 to the Cu3O2. In addition, it is revealed that annealing provides disturbance rather than driving force strengthening the bond energy. Therefore, formulation in terms of bond making and its consequence on the behavior of atoms and valence electrons, and the corresponding parametrization, are demonstrated to be able to correctly reflect the real process of reaction and the correlation of the parameters as well as their natural link to the observations using LEED, STM and PES, or equivalent approaches.									19	0	0	0	4	0	19			0218-625X			WOS:000173718400014

As reaction products, 2,6-dichlorohydroquinone and Cl- ions were identified. Studies of the stoichiometry revealed the consumption of 2 mol of NADH plus 1 mol of O-2 per mol of TCP and the formation of 1 mol of Cl- ions. No evidence for membrane association or for a multicomponent system was obtained, Molecular masses of 240 kDa for the native enzyme and 60 kDa for the subunit were determined, indicating a homotetrameric structure, Cross-linking studies with dimethylsuberimidate were consistent with this finding, TCP was the best substrate for 2,4,6-trichlorophenol-4-monooxygenase (TCP-4-monooxygenase). The majority of other chlorophenols converted by the enzyme bear a chloro substituent in the l-position. 2,6-Dichlorophenol, also accepted as a substrate, was hydroxylated in the 4-position to 2,6-dichlorohydroquinone in a nondehalogenating reaction, NADH and O-2 were consumed by the pure enzyme also in the absence of TCP with simultaneous production of H2O2. The NH2-terminal amino acid sequence of TCP-4-monooxgenase from Azotobacter sp, strain GP1 revealed complete identity with the nucleotide-derived sequence from the analogous enzyme from Pseudomonas pickettii and a high degree of homology with two nondehalogenating monooxygenases. The similarity in enzyme properties and the possible evolutionary relatedness of dehalogenating and nondehalogenating monooxygenases are discussed.									36	0	0	0	34	0	38			0021-9193			WOS:A1997VZ79200027	8981999

S-type asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars are thought to be intermediates in the evolution of oxygen- to carbon-rich AGB stars. The chemical compositions of their circumstellar envelopes are also intermediate but have not been studied in as much detail as their carbon- and oxygen-rich counterparts. W Aql is a nearby S-type star, with well-known circumstellar parameters, making it an ideal object for in-depth study of less common molecules.Aims. We aim to determine the abundances of AlCl and AlF from rotational lines, which have been observed for the first time towards an S-type AGB star. In combination with models based on PACS observations, we aim to update our chemical kinetics network based on these results.Methods. We analyse ALMA observations towards W Aql of AlCl in the ground and first two vibrationally excited states and AlF in the ground vibrational state. Using radiative transfer models, we determine the abundances and spatial abundance distributions of (AlCl)-Cl-35, (AlCl)-Cl-37, and AlF. We also model HCl and HF emission and compare these models to PACS spectra to constrain the abundances of these species.Results. AlCl is found in clumps very close to the star, with emission confined within 0 ''.1 of the star. AlF emission is more extended, with faint emission extending 0 ''.2 to 0 ''.6 from the continuum peak. We find peak abundances, relative to H-2, of 1.7 x 10(-7) for (AlCl)-Cl-35, 7 x 10(-8) for (AlCl)-Cl-37, and 1 x 10(-7) for AlF. From the PACS spectra, we find abundances of 9.7 x 10(-8) and <= 10(-8), relative to H-2, for HCl and HF, respectively.Conclusions. The AlF abundance exceeds the solar F abundance, indicating that fluorine synthesised in the AGB star has already been dredged up to the surface of the star and ejected into the circumstellar envelope. From our analysis of chemical reactions in the wind, we conclude that AlF may participate in the dust formation process, but we cannot fully explain the rapid depletion of AlCl seen in the wind.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			0004-6361	1432-0746		WOS:000722004800001

The carnivorous feeding by ocean, herbivorous feeding of ancestors of rodents and Homo sapiens by dry land; misusing carnivorous food by phylogenetically herbivorous human during last centuries, disorder of biological function of trophology, biological reaction of exotrophy, pathology of biologic functions of adaptation and endoecology, features of cognitive biological function formed etiological factors of atherosclerosis and atheromatosis. The abnormalities of biological reaction metabolismmicro-circulation; discrepancy of mechanisms of regulation of biological reaction at 2d and 3d levels of relative biological perfection in vivo, disorder of biological function of adaptation, biological reaction of compensation formed etiological factors of metabolic arterial hypertension. The synthesis of fatty acids in phylogenesis millions of years before of glucose, preference of cells to absorb fatty acids instead of glucose; previously in phylogenesis effect of hyperglycemia, glucagon and late function of insulin formed priority of metabolism of fatty acids in energetics of organisms and glucose only in the second instance. The formation in phylogenesis of methodological mode of biological subordination in functioning of humoral mediators, incapability of insulin late in phylogenesis of blocking adaptive action of humoral mediators earlier in phylogenesis, especially in visceral fatty tissue form etiological factors of resistance to insulin. The functional limitation of cognitive biological function, difficulties in maintaining unity of internal medium of organism and effects of aphysiologic factors of external medium produces necessity of completing cognitive biological function with activation of biological reaction of apoptosis and autophagy. This occurrence forms etiologic factors of metabolic syndrome - a local pathology of early, visceral, limited in numbers of cells of pool of insulin-independent visceral fatty tissue. The inconsistency of cognitive biological function, necessity of correcting it by more effective biological function of intellect, role of insulin in energy support of new biological function - locomotion, formation of unlimited in numbers of cells а pool late in phylogenesis of insulin-dependent subcutaneous adipocytes, formed etiological factors of obesity. The biological function of depositing of fatty acids in phylogenesis in vivo is characterized by etiological dependence: depositing of fatty acids occurs in the form of non-polar triglycerides and releasing into intercellular medium occurs only in form of polar unesterified fatty acids. The features of induction with substrate, formation of positioning isoforms of fatty acids, impossibility of hydrolyzing them at effecting of hormone-dependent lipase compel to eliminate aphysiologic triglycerides from liver together with hepatocytes implementing biological reactions of apoptosis and autophagy. They become etiological factors of non-alcoholic fatty disease of liver; these are aphysiologic positioning iusoforms of triglycerides as palmitoyl-palmitol-palmitate and stearyl-stearyl-stearate. The formation of endogenous hyperuricemia in phylogenesis was initiated by 2 mutations. The first one - a gene of ascorbic acid "minus" deprived Homo sapiens of synthesis of hydrophilic acceptor of active forms of oxygen. The second one - a gene of uricase "minus" blocked synthesis of allantoin but provided a possibility of re-absorbing uric acid from a pool of primary urine and use it in vivo as an acceptor of active forms of oxygen instead of ascorbic acid under realization of biological function of endoecology,biologic reaction of inflammation.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0869-2084			MEDLINE:30802390	30802390	
J	LECLUSE, C; ROBERT, F								HYDROGEN ISOTOPE-EXCHANGE REACTION-RATES - ORIGIN OF WATER IN THE INNER SOLAR-SYSTEM								GEOCHIMICA ET COSMOCHIMICA ACTA				58	13			2927	2939		10.1016/0016-7037(94)90126-0				JUL 1994	1994	Rate constants for hydrogen isotope exchange between molecular hydrogen and water (k(T)H-2-HDO) and hydrogen and methane (k(T)H-2-CH3D) have been determined experimentally. The temperature dependence of the constants can be expressed by: k(T)H-2-CH3D = 6.1 . 10(-25) exp(4.38 . 10(3)/T) and k(T)H-2-HDO = 2.0. 10(-22) exp(5.17 . 10(3)/T). with k(T) in cm3/sec. Catalytic effects on charcoal, silica, phyllosilicates, and iron were found to be negligible.A model describing the evolution (with time) of the hydrogen isotopic composition of water in the solar nebula is proposed: while the temperature is decreasing in the gas, isotope exchange between H-2 and H2O yields a deuterium enrichment in water.Using Cameron's numerical models (1972, 1978, 1985) of the solar nebula, we show that the observed difference between the protosolar and the carbonaceous chondrite D/H ratios (i.e., between 30 and 150 10(-6), respectively) is well accounted for by our model, provided that (1) water was accreted as ice at a temperature of less-than-or-equal-to 160 K and (2) the hydrogen pressure was higher than 10(-5) atm somewhere between 1 and 3 AU. In such conditions, the calculations show that meteoritic phyllosilicates did not form in the gas phase, by reactions between water vapour and silicate grains, but by the subsequent circulation of liquid water, originally condensed as ice. Water on Earth (D/H = 155 . 10(-6)) also results from such a cold nebula chemistry.									106	0	0	0	2	0	106			0016-7037	1872-9533		WOS:A1994NX23700015		
J	Garrido, José Antonio; Brillas, Enric; Cabot, Pere Lluís; Centellas, Francesc; Arias, Conchita; Rodríguez, Rosa María								Mineralization of Drugs in Aqueous Medium by Advanced Oxidation Processes								Portugaliae Electrochimica Acta				25	1			19	41						2007	2007	At present chemical (AOPs) and electrochemical (EAOPs) advanced oxidation processes with ability to destroy organic pollutants in waters are being developed. These methods are based on the production of hydroxyl radical (•OH) as oxidant. In AOPs •OH radical can be obtained from Fenton’s reaction between Fe2+ and H2O2 added to the medium, photoreduction of Fe3+ species or reaction between ozone and Fe2+. In EAOPs this radical is formed from water oxidation on the surface of a high O2-overvoltage anode and/or Fenton’s reaction between Fe2+ added to the medium and H2O2 electrogenerated at the cathode by the two-electron reduction of oxygen. The present work reports the mineralization of several aromatic drugs such as paracetamol, ibuprofen, clofibric acid and salicylic acid by AOPs based on ozonation catalyzed by Fe2+, Cu2+ and/or UVA light and EAOPs like anodic oxidation, electro-Fenton and photoelectro-Fenton, which are environmentally friendly electrochemical methods. For the latter processes, the drug decay with time and the evolution of aromatic intermediates and generated carboxylic acids are studied. Anodic oxidation is only effective when a boron-doped diamond (BDD) anode is used, whereas the photoelectro-Fenton process with Fe2+, Cu2+ and UVA light is the most potent method to completely destroy the drugs. The combined use of catalysts Fe2+, Cu2+ and UVA light in catalyzed ozonation also leads to overall decontamination of drug solutions.	Actualmente se están desarrollando métodos químicos (AOPs) y electroquímicos (EAOPs) de oxidación avanzada que son capaces de destruir contaminantes orgánicos en aguas. Estas técnicas están basadas en la producción del radical hidroxilo (•OH) como oxidante. En los AOPs el radical •OH se puede obtener a partir de la reacción de Fenton entre el Fe2+ y el H2O2 adicionados al medio, de la fotorreducción de especies de Fe3+ o bien de la reacción entre el ozono y el Fe2+. En los EAOPs dicho radical se forma a partir de la oxidación del agua en la superficie de un ánodo de elevado sobrepotencial de O2 y/o de la reacción de Fenton entre el Fe2+ añadido al medio y el H2O2 electrogenerado en el cátodo por la reducción bielectrónica del O2. El presente trabajo describe la mineralización de algunos fármacos aromáticos como el paracetamol, el ibuprofeno, el ácido clofíbrico y el ácido salicílico usando AOPs basados en la ozonización catalizada por Fe2+, Cu2+ y/o luz UVA y EAOPs como la oxidación anódica, el electro-Fenton y el fotoelectro-Fenton, que son métodos electroquímicos compatibles con el medio ambiente. Para los últimos procesos, se ha estudiado la desaparición de los fármacos con el tiempo y la evolución de los intermedios aromáticos y de los ácidos carboxílicos generados. La oxidación anódica sólo es efectiva cuando se utiliza un ánodo de diamante dopado con boro (BDD), mientras que el proceso fotoelectro-Fenton con Fe2+, Cu2+ y luz UVA es el método más potente para destruir totalmente los fármacos. El uso conjunto de los catalizadores Fe2+, Cu2+ y luz UVA en la ozonización catalizada también conduce a la descontaminación total de las disoluciones de fármacos.								26	1	0	0	8	0	26			0872-1904			SCIELO:S0872-19042007000100003

We consider the timescales associated with formation of an isotopically anomalous water reservoir derived from CO self-shielding, and also the vertical and radial transport timescales of gas and solids in the nebula. The timescales for chemical M IF are very rapid. CO self-shielding models predict that the Sun has Delta O-17(SMOW) similar to -20 parts per thousand, (Clayton, 2002). and chemical mass-independent fractionation models predict Delta O-17(SMOW) similar to 0 parts per thousand. Preliminary Genesis results have been reported by McKeegan et al. (McKeegan K. D., Coath C. D., Heber, V., Jarzebinski G., Kallio A. P., Kunihiro T., Mao P. H. and Burnett D. S. (2008b) The oxygen isotopic composition of captured solar wind: first results from the Genesis. EOS Trans. AGU 89(53), Fall Meet. Suppl., P42A-07 (abstr)) and yield a Delta O-17(SMOW) Of similar to -25 parts per thousand consistent with a CO self-shielding scenario. Assuming that subsequent Genesis analyses support the preliminary results, it then remains to determine the relative contributions of CO self-shielding from the X-point, the surface of the solar nebula and the parent molecular cloud.The relative formation ages of chondritic components can be related to several timescales in the self-shielding theories. Most importantly the age difference of similar to 1-3 My between CAIs and chondrules is consistent with radial transport from the outer solar nebula (>10 AU) to the meteorite-forming region, which supports both the nebular surface and parent cloud self-shielding scenarios. An elevated radiation field intensity is predicted by the surface shielding model, and yields substantial CO photolysis (similar to 50%) on timescales of 0.1-1 My. An elevated radiation field is also consistent with the parent cloud model. The elevated radiation intensities may indicate solar nebula birth in a medium to large cluster, and may be consistent with the injection of Fe-60 from a nearby supernova and with the photoevaporative truncation of the solar nebula at KBO orbital distances (similar to 47 AU). CO self-shielding is operative at the X-point even when H-2 absorption is included, but it is not yet clear whether the self-shielding signature can be imparted to silicates. A simple analysis of diffusion times shows that oxygen isotope exchange between O-16-depleted nebular H2O and chondrules during chondrule formation events is rapid (similar to minutes), but is also expected to be rapid for most components of CAIs, with the exception of spinel. This is consistent with the observation that spinel grains are often the most O-16-rich component of CAIs, but is only broadly consistent with the greater degree of exchange in other CAI components. Preliminary disk model calculations of self-shielding by N-2 demonstrate that large delta N-15 enrichments (similar to +800 parts per thousand) are possible in HCN formed by reaction of N atoms with organic radicals (e.g., CH2) which may account for N-15-rich hotspots observed in lithic clasts in some carbonaceous chondrites and which lends support to the CO self-shielding model for oxygen isotopes.

Significant inhibition of PCDD/Fs by thiourea (TUA) and ammonium dihydrogen phosphate (ADP) was observed as 97.2% and 98.2%, respectively, except for potassium dihydrogen phosphate (PDP). ADP and PDP exhibited better inhibition on PCDFs than on PCDDs, whereas TUA exhibited the opposite effect. After adding inhibitors, the proportion of C-O/C=O/O-C=O bonds at the surface of fly ash increased, and stronger oxidation of carbon occurred, together with the conversion from Cu2+ to Cu+ and the inhibition of organic chlorine formation. Kinetic model results indicated that TUA might either suppress the carbon gasification or promote the decomposition of PCDD/Fs, resulting in a remarkable inhibition of PCDD/Fs formation. Simulated chemical reaction equilibrium further comfirmed that catalytic metal could be deactivated into CuS and Cu2S by sulfur, and into Cu2P2O7 by phosphorus. Moreover, NH3, decomposed from TUA and ADP, was able to convert Cl-2 into HCl, albeit with a weaker chlorination ability. This study of inhibition mechanisms is useful for the exploration and utilization of efficient inhibitors in full-scale incinerators. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

As an alternative to costly transition metal catalysts, it is believed that carbon materials are promising catalysts for this process, of which activated carbon (AC) provides reasonable reaction kinetics.The application of a chemical looping process to methane thermocatalytic decomposition is investigated for continuous high purity H-2 production using AC as a catalyst. To be suitable for a fluidized bed-based chemical looping process, the AC catalyst should meet certain requirements besides its contribution to reaction kinetics. Accordingly, it was evaluated by durability, crushing strength, and resistance to agglomeration. The evolution of textural properties and surface chemistry is examined as well to understand the catalytic activity performance. The results show that, under proper regeneration, the AC catalyst demonstrates no deactivation during cyclic study and prove that high purity CO2-free H-2 can be continuously produced. The crushing strength of AC catalyst is suitable for a chemical looping process and no agglomeration is observed under parameters tested. In addition, the experimental data also indicated that surface area plays an important role in the cyclic catalytic activity of the AC catalyst. Copyright (c) 2016, Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC.

Although great progress has been achieved, phase-controlled synthesis of cobalt phosphides nanocrystals or related nanohybrids remains a challenge, and their use in overall water splitting (OWS) is not systematically studied. Herein, three kinds of cobalt phosphides nanocrystals encapsulated by P-doped carbon (PC) and married with P-doped graphene (PG) nanohybrids, including CoP@PC/PG, CoP-Co2P@PC/PG, and Co2P@PC/PG, are obtained through controllable thermal conversion of presynthesized supramolecular gels that contain cobalt salt, phytic acid, and graphene oxides at proper temperature under Ar/H-2 atmosphere. Among them, the mixed-phase CoP-Co2P@PC/PG nanohybrids manifest high electrocatalytic activity toward both hydrogen and oxygen evolution in alkaline media. Remarkably, using them as bifunctional catalysts, the fabricated CoP-Co2P@PC/PG||CoP-Co2P@PC/PG electrolyzer only needs a cell voltage of 1.567 V for driving OWS to reach the current density at 10 mA cm(-2), superior to their pure-phase counterparts and recently reported bifunctional catalysts based devices. Also, such a CoP-Co2P@PC/PG||CoP-Co2P@PC/PG device exhibits outstanding stability for OWS. This work may shed some light on optimizing TMPs nanostructures based on phase engineering, and promote their applications in OWS or other renewable energy options.									86	4	0	0	6	0	86			1613-6810	1613-6829		WOS:000460655600007	30690876

It was shown that in the presence of DTA and DMDT adsorbed on copper surface depress the reaction rate of anodic dissolution and cathodic hydrogen evolution and obey Langmuir isotherm. Surface findings indicated the inhibitor film formed at copper surface can block corrosion and improve hydrophobicity.									13	2	0	0	0	0	15			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000489699700046

The fast proton transfer (FPT) and tautomerism in the ketohydrazoneazoenol systems have been analyzed on the basis of CPMD and PIMD methods level. The two-dimensional free-energy landscape of reaction coordinate delta-parameter and R-N center dot center dot center dot O distances shows the NH tautomer to be more favorable in the gas phase as well as in the solid state according to the CP and PI results, respectively. The hydrogen between the nitrogen and the oxygen atoms adopts a starkly asymmetrical position in the double potential well. The molecular geometry and energy barrier for the intramolecular proton transference were calculated, and the value found suggested a strong hydrogen bond with low barrier for FPT mechanism. These studies and the two-dimensional average index of pi-delocalization lambda landscape of time evolutions of R-N1 center dot center dot center dot O1 and R-C1=O1 distances for both the crystals indicate that the hydrogen bonds in the crystals of 1-(phenylazo)-2-naphthol (I) and 1-(4-F-phenylazo)-2-naphthol (II) have characteristic properties for the type of bonding model: resonance-assisted hydrogen bonds and low-barrier hydrogen bonds, without the existence of equilibrium in the two tautomers. The infrared spectrum has been calculated, and a comparative vibrational analysis has been performed. The CPMD vibrational results appear to qualitatively agree with the experimental ones.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			1520-6106			WOS:000442437700007	30056713

Evolution of eukaryotic NOS from prokaryotic antecedents involved a series of gene fusion events, producing a modular enzyme, and the concomitant development of sophisticated control mechanisms that are isoform specific and tailored to the role of enzymes in signal transduction or immune response. Recent information on the structures of NOS isoforms at all levels from primary amino acid sequence to high resolution crystallography allows a deepening understanding of many aspects of these important proteins including interdomain interactions, dimerization, cofactor, substrate, and isoform specific inhibitor binding as well catalysis and control. The details of the NOS reaction mechanism and its control through the regulation of electron transfer by CaM binding and other mechanisms are still being elucidated and are well worth further examination. The alignment of the molecular surfaces of the independently folded domains is a central feature of structure, catalysis and control in these important enzymes, and will be the focus of the present review.									112	1	0	0	98	1	115			1093-9946	1093-4715		WOS:000180266400027	12456347

Carving the senescent phenotype by the chemical reactivity of catecholamines: An integrative review								AGEING RESEARCH REVIEWS				75						101570	10.1016/j.arr.2022.101570				MAR 2022	2022	Macromolecules damaged by covalent modifications produced by chemically reactive metabolites accumulate in the slowly renewable components of living bodies and compromise their functions. Among such metabolites, catecholamines (CA) are unique, compared with the ubiquitous oxygen, ROS, glucose and methylglyoxal, in that their high chemical reactivity is confined to a limited set of cell types, including the dopaminergic and norad-renergic neurons and their direct targets, which suffer from CA propensities for autoxidation yielding toxic quinones, and for Pictet-Spengler reactions with carbonyl-containing compounds, which yield mitochondrial toxins. The functions progressively compromised because of that include motor performance, cognition, reward-driven behaviors, emotional tuning, and the neuroendocrine control of reproduction. The phenotypic manifestations of the resulting disorders culminate in such conditions as Parkinson's and Alzheimer's diseases, hypertension, sarcopenia, and menopause. The reasons to suspect that CA play some special role in aging accumulated since early 1970-ies. Published reviews address the role of CA hazardousness in the development of specific aging-associated diseases. The present integrative review explores how the bizarre discrepancy between CA hazardousness and biological importance could have emerged in evolution, how much does the chemical reactivity of CA contribute to the senescent phenotype in mammals, and what can be done with it.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1568-1637	1872-9649		WOS:000786312700008	35051644

However, low specific surface area and fewer surface defects lead to low catalytic activities in the oxygen reduction/evolution reaction (ORR/OER). Herein, the Co3O4/LaCoO3 composite material is prepared by a selective dissolution method. The onset and half-wave potentials of the Co3O4/LaCoO3 hybrid material are 0.895 and 0.640 V during the ORR process. It also exhibits a small overpotential of 503 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) for the OER process. What's more, the Zn-air battery that uses the Co3O4/LaCoO3 hybrid material can reach a maximum power density of 155.7 mW cm(-2), which is larger than that of the original LaCoO3 (137.8 mW cm(-2)). In addition, the potential difference of this battery with the Co3O4/LaCoO3 sample increased by 22 mV after 100 charge-discharge cycles, which is much lower than that of Zn-air batteries with the LaCoO3 and Co3O4 samples (52 and 26 mV). The above results illustrate that improved bifunctional catalytic properties of the Co3O4/LaCoO3 hybrid material can be associated with the porous structure, large surface area, weak Co-O bond in the lattice and more surface defects on the surface.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			2398-4902			WOS:000620730300008

During the spraying, binder metals were melted and a small portion of metal carbides, such as WC, Cr7C3 and Ni3C, were melted, partially melted, or decomposed to W2C, Cr, Ni and free carbon. A porous coating was formed by the evolution of carbon oxide gases formed by the reaction of the free carbon and the sprayed oxygen gas. For further improvement, a CO2 laser heat treatment (LH) was performed on the coating. Laser beam (10.6 mu m, continuous mode, 400 W) irradiated an oval-shaped focal spot (5 mm x 4 mm) for 0.6 s at a scanning speed 400 min/min, heating to about 950-1200 degrees C from the edge to the center of the spot. Laser tracks overlap each other 30 %. The porous coating was compacted by the LH, reducing the coating thickness by about 29 % from 280 mu m to 200 mu m and the porosity by about 7 times from 2.6 +/- 0.4 % to 0.35 +/- 0.06 %. The surface hardness of In718 (410 +/- 30 Hv) was increased more than twice to 983 +/- 101 Hv by the coating; furthermore, it was increased 45 % (1425 94 Hv) by LH for 0.6 s. The friction coefficient of the In718 surface (0.45 +/- 0.08) was reduced 29 % (0.32 +/- 0.02) and 9 % (0.29 +/- 0.03) by the coating and by the LH, respectively. The wear depth was reduced from 52 mu m to 30 mu m and to 12 mu m by the coating and by the LH, respectively. A HVOF coating of WC-CrC-Ni powder on a metal surface and a LH of the coating are highly recommended for improving the surface properties, the friction behavior and wear resistance.					17th World Interfinish Congress17th World Interfinish Congress	JUN 16-19, 2008JUN 16-19, 2008		Busan, SOUTH KOREABusan, SOUTH KOREA	9	0	0	0	0	0	9			0374-4884	1976-8524		WOS:000264197400027

When starting from its dark equilibrium (mainly state Si), the catalytic center can be clocked through its redox states (S-0...S-4) by a series of short flashes of light. The center involves at least a Mn-4-cluster and a special tyrosine residue, named Y-Z, as redox cofactors plus two essential ionic cofactors, Cl- and Ca2+. Centers which have lost Ca2+ do not evolve oxygen. We investigated the stepped progression in dark-adapted PS II core particles after the removal of Ca2+. Y-Z was oxidized from the first flash on. The difference spectrum of Y-Z --> Y-Z(ox) differed from the one in competent centers, where it has been ascribed to a hydrogen-bonded tyrosinate. The rate of the electron transfer from Y-Z to P-680(+) was slowed down by three orders of magnitude and its kinetic isotope effect rose up from 1.1 to 2.5, Proton release into the bulk was now a prerequisite for the electron transfer from Y-Z to P-680(+). On the basis of these results and similar effects in Mn-(plus Ca2+-)depleted PS II (M. Haumann et al., Biochemistry, 38 (1999) 1258-1267) we conclude that the presence of Ca2+ in the catalytic center is required to tune the apparent pK of a base cluster? B, to which Y-Z is linked by hydrogen bonds. The deposition of a proton on B within close proximity of Y-Z (not its release into the bulk !) is a necessary condition for the reduction in nanoseconds of P-680(+) and for the functioning of water oxidation. The removal of Ca2+ rises the pK of B, thereby disturbing the hydrogen bonded structure of YZB. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V.

Nanostructured orthorhombic Nb2O5-xNx was synthesized by a simple solid-state combustion reaction (SSCR). The nanostructural features of Nb2O5-xNx were examined by FESEM and HRTEM, which showed they had a porous chain-like structure, with chains interlocked with each other and with nanoparticles sized less than 10 nm. Diffuse reflectance spectra depicted their extended absorbance in the visible region with a band gap of 2.4 eV. The substitution of nitrogen in place of oxygen atoms as well as Nb-N bond formation were confirmed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and Raman spectroscopy. A computational study (DFT) of Nb2O5-xNx was also performed for investigation and conformation of the crystal and electronic structure. N-Substitution clearly showed a narrowing of the band gap due to N 2p bands cascading above the O 2p band. Considering the band gap in the visible region, Nb2O5-xNx exhibited enhanced photocatalytic activity toward hydrogen evolution (3010 mu mol h(-1) g(-1)) for water splitting and (9358 mu mol h(-1) g(-1)) for H2S splitting under visible light. The enhanced photocatalytic activity of Nb2O5-xNx was attributed to its extended absorbance in the visible region due to its electronic structure being modified upon doping, which in turn generates more electron-hole pairs, which are responsible for higher H-2 generation. More significantly, the mesoporous nanostructure accelerated the supression of electron and hole recombination, which also contributed to the enhancement of its activity.									45	0	0	0	4	0	45			1477-9226	1477-9234		WOS:000414775000021	29043333

The stability of the alloy has been monitored after an acidic washing, to remove, if present, unalloyed metals and pre-leach the surface. An excellent combination of performance, e.g. Tafel slope lower than 30 mV/dec and a negligible overpotential, were measured for our Pt/Pd/Co NPs, with an atomic ratio (7:3:3) in a flow system. Very high hydrogen production rate of 7.09 mL cm(-2)h(-1) at -0.05 V was measured. The electrochemical production of hydrogen from liquid methanol in acidic solution was also investigated. The Pt/Pd/Co NPs exhibit an anodic current density of 560 mA/mgp, during methanol oxidation in acidic solution at 0.45 V and an I-f/I-b ratio of 1.96. A quantitative evaluation of the performance of the electrode in the two different processes has been made, too.									16	0	0	0	0	0	16			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000444600300015

The material tested is a ternary mixture of lactose, starch, and potassium nitrate, which has already been used in an attempt to estimate heat release rate using the FM-Global Fire Propagation Apparatus. it provides a well-controlled combustion chamber to study the evolution of the combustion products when varying the O-2 concentration, between air and low oxidizer conditions. Different chemical behaviours have been exhibited. When the O-2 concentration was reduced beyond 18%, large variations were observed in the CO2 and CO concentrations. This critical O-2 concentration seems to be the limit before which the material only uses its own oxidizer to react. On the other hand mass loss did not highlight this change in chemical reactions and remained similar whatever the, test conditions. This presumes that the oxidation of CO into CO2 are due to reactions occurring in the gas phase especially for large O-2 concentrations. This actual behaviour can be verified using a simplified flammability limit model adapted for the current work. Finally, a sensitivity analysis has been carried out to underline the influence of CO concentration in the evaluation of heat release rate using typical calorimetric methods. The results of this study provide a critical basis for the investigation of the combustion of a fuel/oxidizer Mixture and for the validation of future numerical models. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc.

J	Fox, JL								Effect of H-2 on the Martian ionosphere: Implications for atmospheric evolution								JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-SPACE PHYSICS				108	A6					1223	10.1029/2001JA000203				JUN 4 2003	2003	[1] Because H-2 reacts efficiently with O+, CO2+, CO+, and N-2(+), the molecular hydrogen abundance assumed in models of the Martian ionosphere greatly affects the high altitude density profiles of these ions. We have found that models of the low solar activity Martian ionosphere exhibit much smaller O+ densities than the measured values if the adopted H-2 abundance is of the order of 40 ppm, the value proposed in a 1998 model of the Martian atmosphere. For a model based on the recently measured H-2 abundance of 15 ppm [Krasnopolsky and Feldman, 2001a, 2001b], the O+ densities are closer to, but still somewhat less than the Viking densities. The O+ peak densities of similar to600-750 cm(-3) measured by the retarding potential analyzers on Vikings 1 and 2 [Hanson et al., 1977] are best reproduced with H-2 abundances less than similar to4 ppm. We have investigated the effect of various H-2 mixing ratios at the lower boundary of our model, and we find that the high altitude densities of O+, CO2+, CO+, and N-2(+) ions decrease as the H-2 abundance increases, and are much less for H-2 mixing ratios greater than 4 ppm than previous models have shown. Moreover, the photochemical escape rates of heavy atoms, such as C and N that are due to reactions of these ions, are also reduced. The Martian atmosphere was probably more reducing in past epochs, and therefore consisted of a larger fraction of H-2. As the abundance of H-2 increases, the composition of the exosphere will also be altered, and the altitude of the exobase will rise. At very large mixing ratios, H and H-2 could potentially dominate the absorption of EUV radiation. Thus the escape of species by other photochemical mechanisms such as photodissociation and photodissociative ionization could also be reduced. If so, the nonthermal escape rates of heavy atoms in past epochs may have been much lower than previous estimates in which it is assumed that the oxidation state of the Martian atmosphere has remained constant over time.									39	0	0	0	0	0	38			2169-9380	2169-9402		WOS:000183530500001

While the high surface area of nanoparticles greatly enlarges the density of reaction sites, it often also leads to relatively rapid degradation as the particles tend to coarsen to reduce their high surface energy. Therefore, a nickel/gadolinia-doped-ceria (CGO) cermet electrode is studied, with a novel porous nanostructure consisting of nanoscale Ni (100 nm) and CGO (50 nm) crystallites, cosintered from nanocomposite precursor agglomerate particles. This electrode combines both high performance and excellent durability, with a total area-specific resistance (ASR) of 0.11 Omega cm(2) at 800 degrees C and a stable ASR with up to 170 h ageing in humidified 5% H-2-N-2. Post-test analysis by 3D tomography shows that nickel coarsens and is responsible for the initial increase in ASR. However, the subsequent electrochemical performance is stable because reaction at the double phase boundaries (DPBs) on the surfaces of nanoscale CGO becomes dominant and is resistant to ageing. At this stage, the coarsened Ni network is also stabilized by the surrounding nanostructure. The dominant role of the DPB reaction is supported quantitatively using a continuum model with geometrical parameters obtained from 3D tomography.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000584489800040	33044810

Evidence is presented that the hydroperoxy radical HO2. is the main oxidative species for Orange II in oxygenated aqueous solution under visible light irradiation. The probability of reaction between O-2 and Orange II leading to radical formation(approximate to 5 x 10(-4)) is observed to be very low. The lifetime and amplitude of the radicals anions and cations in solution are compared in O-2-, air- and Ar-containing solutions. Singlet oxygen (O-1(2)) is shown not to be present during the initial photobleaching stages of Orange II. Steady-state irradiation of Orange II in aqueous solution in the presence of O-2 causes two simultaneous processes: photodegradation to more biodegradable intermediates with CO2 evolution and photoinduced generation of peroxides in solution. The observed peroxide generation stops when initial Orange II reaches a low concentration and does not occur from the intermediates during the photodegradation of Orange II. Direct electron transfer from excited Orange II to O-2 provides the driving force for the accelerated photodegradation of the dye. No electron transfer to O-2 was observed in the dark involving the ground state of the azo dye. The oxidation potential Orange II/Orange(+.) is determined by cyclic voltammetry to be 0.76 V(NHE) and a value of - 1.54 V(NHE) could be estimated for the oxidation potential of the couple Orange II*/Orange(+.).									133	3	0	0	28	0	133			1144-0546			WOS:000081596500012

In a symmetric two-electrode system assembled by the prepared electrocatalyst, an ultralow cell voltage of 1.46 V was required to drive 10 mA cm(-2), which was much lower than that of the symmetric two-electrode system assembled by bare Ni foam, bare Ni-Fe foam, or nickel sulfides without iron doping. The iron-doped nickel sulfides had desirable stability for overall water splitting, and the electrocatalytic performance showed no significant degradation during long-term durability test (70 h at 10 mA cm(-2)). The 3D porous structure of Ni-Fe foam, the in-situ growth of catalyst, and the combined iron doping effects contributed to the outstanding performance of our prepared catalyst for overall water splitting.									3	0	0	0	1	0	3			0042-207X	1879-2715		WOS:000580600700040

CuGaO2 and its indium doped analogue CuGa1-xInxO2 (x = 0.065) delafossite oxides without/with NiO and RuO2 co-catalysts loading in nanostructures were prepared by solid state reaction method. These materials possess hexagonal rhombohedral structure (XRD); morphologically CuGaO2 has i rregu larly-sh aped plate like particles while all others have ordered hexagonal rod-like arrangements (FESEM). Co-catalyst deposits of few nm sizes are observable as white spots/patches on the surface of naked oxide catalysts. Acquiring p-type conductivity from the mixed valence of Cu (+1 and +2) and oxygen deficiency, these catalysts strongly absorb visible light (Eg = 1.85 eV) in a wide wavelength range. They decompose H2S in aqueous 0.5 M KOH solution under visible light (lambda >= 420 nm) irradiation and generate H-2 to the tune of 4300 mu mol/h, giving rise to a high quantum efficiency of 13.6%) at 550 nm. The exceedingly higher rate of H-2 production appears to result from a combined contribution of chemical nature (p-block elements Ga and In), p-type conductivity and an efficient e(-)-h(+) separation.

Tungsten carbide (WC) is a possible valence isoelectronic substitute for Pt. Using first-principles quantum mechanics calculations, we systematically investigate H binding to WC(0001) and Pt(111) surfaces. Moreover, inspired by recent experiments on hybrid monolayer-Pt/WC catalysts, we study H adsorption on these hybrid surfaces. We consider both W and C terminations and vary the number of Pt layers. We predict that the H binding energy (HBE) plateaus rapidly with the number of Pt layers and that a monolayer of Pt on a WC substrate has a similar HBE to that of pure Pt. This corroborates the experimental observation that the two systems exhibit similar electrochemical activities. Increasing the number of Pt layers leads to a slight increase in the HBE and a projected decrease in catalytic activity. Through various electronic structure analyses, we show that the similarity in activities is due to an intrinsic alteration of the character of the Pt/WC surface rather than a similarity to the pure Pt surface. Our findings provide guidance for tuning parameters that affect catalytic activity by controlling WC surface termination and Pt overlayer thickness. (C) 2016 The Electrochemical Society.

X-ray powder diffraction, transmission electron microscopy, Ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy, energy-dispersive spectroscopy, elemental analysis and photocatalytic reaction were performed to investigate these samples. Selected-area electron diffraction analysis of the mixed crystalline phases of powder samples revealed that each particle had only one crystalline phase. This indicates that entire particles underwent a rapid structural transformation once their nitrogen content reached a critical value. We discovered a new intermediate crystalline phase of tantalum oxynitride, TaO(a>1)N(b<1), appeared before the generation of the beta-TaON phase. The crystal structure of TaO(a>1)N(b<1) is suggested to be monoclinic, with unit cell parameters of a = 5.1 angstrom, b = 35.6 angstrom, c = 5.4 angstrom and beta = 93.5 degrees. The ratio of nitrogen to oxygen in the samples increased with increasing nitridation duration. The increasing rate is different in the different nitridation stage due to the different structure of the samples. Nitrogen entered the samples quickly during the initial 5 h of nitridation, and a monoclinic beta-TaON phase was formed. A mesoporous structure emerged in the nitrided particles during the phase transition, greatly increasing the surface area of the samples. The more the nitrogen entered one sample, the darker the color of it due to the narrower the band gap. H-2 and O-2 evolved by water splitting from the nitrided samples irradiated with visible light. Change in the evolution rate of H-2 and O-2 had a relation with the structure of the samples.									4	0	0	0	1	0	4			2050-5698	2050-5701		WOS:000343184900006	24948708

We investigated the association of genetic variations in RSV with acute severe bronchiolitis in infants.Methods: We reviewed medical records of infants younger than 1 year of age hospitalized due to acute bronchiolitis between November 2016 and February 2017. Subjects were classified as severe or mild based on the use of mechanical or noninvasive ventilation. The associations between severity of the disease, sex, age at admission, oxygen saturation at admission and laboratory test results were analyzed. RSV sequence analysis was performed in the severe group.Results: Among 114 infants, 80 underwent respiratory viral polymerase chain reaction using nasopharyngeal swab; of these, 53 (66.3%) showed positive for RSV. Of the 53 RSV-positive samples, 9 were categorized as the severe group and 44 were categorized as the mild group. Male sex, young age, longer duration of admission, minimum SaO(2) at admission and bronchiolitis severity score were significantly correlated with disease severity in the severe group than in the mild group (all variables, P< 0.001). Phylogenetic and sequence analysis in the severe group revealed 8 RSV-A, ON1 genotype and 1 RSV-B, BA4 genotype.Conclusion: Phylogenetic types of RSV in subjects of the severe group were RSV-A, ON1 genotype or RSV-B, BA4 genotype which were prevalent in the Korean community at the same time. Our study showed that disease severity was not significantly associated with RSV genotypic evolution or antigenic drift in Korea during winter season 2016-17.									2	0	0	0	2	0	2			2288-0402	2288-0410		WOS:000430107600007

We presented a method to obtain well-adherent large-scale BDD/Nb electrode by the modified hot filament chemical vapor deposition system (HFCVD). SiC particles were sand blasted to enhance the adhesion of BDD coating. The BDD coating was then deposited on both sides of Nb which was placed vertically and closely with filament grids on both sides. The BDD/Nb electrodes had no deformation because the thermal deformations of the BDD films on both sides of the Nb substrate conteracted each other during cooling process after deposition. The surface morphology and purity of the BDD/Nb electrode were analyzed by Raman and scanning elestron microscope (SEM) techniques. Scratch test was used to investigate the adhesion of BDD films. The electrochemical performances were measured by cyclic voltammetry test. The BDD electrode at the B/C ratio of 2 000 X 10-6 held a higher oxygen evolution potential thanks to its high sp3 carbon content. Accelerated life test illustrated that the sandblasting pretreatment obviously enhanced the adhesion of BDD coating which resulted in a longer service duration than the un-sandblasted one.									0	1	0	0	0	0	1			1005-1120			INSPEC:16099221		
J	Zhang, Tingting; Lin, Peng; Wei, Ning; Wang, Daoai								Enhanced Photoelectrochemical Water-Splitting Property on TiO2 Nanotubes by Surface Chemical Modification and Wettability Control								ACS APPLIED MATERIALS & INTERFACES				12	17			20110	20118		10.1021/acsami.0c03051				APR 29 2020	2020	We report a simple method to control the photoelectrochemical (PEC) water-splitting performance of TiO2 nanotube arrays (NTs) by surface chemical modification. Four types of modifier molecules with different surface energy and functional groups, including amine (-NH2), n-alkane (-CnH2n+1), perfluoroalkyl (-F), and polymer molecule (-polymer), were self-assembled to the surface of TiO2 NTs, which could change the surface chemical composition and wettability from superhydrophilicity to hydrophobicity. Interestingly, different from expected results, photoelectrochemical measurement results show that the n-octadecyltrichlorosilane-modified TiO2 nanotube arrays with a contact angle of about 134 degrees present the highest PEC property with doubled photocurrent density and more negative onset potential. And the total PEC performance order of the monolayers-modified TiO2 NTs is (-CnH2n+1) > (-F) > (-NH2) > (-OH, pristine TiO2) > (-polymer), which is due to the molecular monolayers modification being able to suppress the recombination of photogenerated electrons and holes and facilitate water oxidation by regulating the interface electric double layer, whereas a thick polymer layer on the photoelectrode surface would affect the light absorbance and decrease the PEC performance. Further investigation indicates that the surface energy and wettability of the TiO2 photoelectrode adjusted by surface modification also have an important influence on the interface reaction of water oxidation and the adsorption/desorption of newly formed oxygen, which also provides a new method for controlling the surface photocatalytic reactions.									22	1	0	0	1	0	21			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000529924800090	32255600

As an alternative fuel source, biodiesel is attractive because it reduces engine emissions. However, biodiesel produces higher NOx emissions compared to ordinary diesel fuel. Previous researches have established many factors that cause biodiesel to produce elevated NOx emissions. This study reviews the impacts of biodiesel combustion on NOx emissions and their reduction approaches in diesel engines. The first part of this study recaps the NOx formation mechanisms for understanding the kinetics behind the NOx forming reactions. The second part describes the factors affecting on NOx emissions. This paper established that higher NOx emissions are produced for biodiesel combustion which influenced by several factors such as physicochemical properties and molecular structure of biodiesel, adiabatic flame temperature, ignition delay time, injection timing and engine load conditions etc. The final section discusses on the reduction of NOx emissions from biodiesel fuelled engines for both pre and post combustion techniques. The results of reduction approaches of the NOx emissions implies, exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) and retarded injection timing are effective as well as low cost techniques than others. Between these two techniques, EGR reduces the NOx emissions at 5-25% EGR rate adequately in biofuelled engine by controlling oxygen content and combustion peak temperature with slightly decreasing HC and CO emissions. However this technique shows few penalties on smoke and PM emissions as well as brake specific fuel consumption if not perfectly optimized. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

A constant positive potential (chronoamperometry) is applied to Ce0.98Pd0.02O2-delta working electrode which causes Ce4+ to reduce to Ce3+ to the extent of similar to 35%, while Pd remains in the +2 oxidation state. Electrochemically cycling this electrode between 0.0-1.2 V reverts back to the original state of the catalyst. This reversibility is attributed to the reversible reduction of Ce4+ to Ce3+ state. CeO2 electrode with no metal component reduces to CeO2-y (y similar to 0.4) after applying 1.2 V which is not reversible and the original composition of CeO2 cannot be brought back in any electrochemical condition. During the electro-catalytic oxygen evolution reaction at a constant 1.2 V for 1000 s, Ce0.98Pd0.02O2-delta reaches a steady state composition with Pd in the +2 states and Ce4+ : Ce3+ in the ratio of 0.65 : 0.35. This composition can be denoted as Ce0.634+Ce0.354+Pd0.02O2-delta-y (y similar to 0.17). When pure CeO2 is put under similar electrochemical condition, it never reaches the steady state composition and reduces almost to 85%. Thus, Ce0.98Pd0.02O2-delta forms a stable electrode for the electro-oxidation of H2O to O-2 unlike CeO2 due to the metal support interaction.									18	0	0	0	2	0	18			1477-9226	1477-9234		WOS:000296204100023	21952819

The morphology of the corrosion layer and corrosion section of Pb and Pb-La alloys were analyzed by scanning electron microscope (SEM) after corrosion testing. It was found that the addition of La inhibits the oxygen evolution reaction on the surface of Pb alloy electrodes, and La amounts of 0.00600 and 0.0540 wt.% in Pb-La alloy electrodes can lead to a more effective inhibition. The results of the LSV, CV and EIS experiments show that the addition of La can inhibit the growth of the anodic Pb(II) oxides and PbO2 film. The resistance of the anodic film on the Pb-La electrodes is much lower than that on the Pb electrode. SEM for the corrosion layer indicates that the corrosion product on pure Pb and Pb-0.0195% La alloy is uniform and compact. The corrosion products on the alloys with La contents of 0.00600, 0.0112 and 0.0540 are loose and porous that the active materials can easily sit in the apertures to contact the grid surface intimately with the effective. The results demonstrate that Pb-La alloys show the potential for application as the positive grid material in maintenance-free lead-acid batteries. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

The results showed that when the doping content of Sb is 8 mol %(SnO2-Sb (0.08)), the SnO2 electrode exhibited best activities for the decolorization and mineralization of AO7. The concentration of NaF in electroplating solution had a noticeable effect on PbO2 electrode for the decolorization of AO7 solution, but little influence on the COD removal rate. The anodic stability tests showed that the electrode prepared in the solution containing 0.10 g l(-1) NaF (PbO2-F(0.10)) was best for environmental application. The comparison of SnO2-Sb (0.08), PbO2-F (0.10) and Boron-doped Diamond (BDD) electrodes revealed that a more rapid decolorization rate was obtained on SnO2-Sb (0.08) and PbO2-F (0.10) electrodes in dilute AO7 solutions, while higher COD removal rate of concentrated AO7 solutions was on BDD and SnO2-Sb (0.08) electrodes. The effect of concentration of Na2SO4 on the degradation rate of AO7 was very notable on BDD electrode for its highest overpotential of oxygen evolution reaction. In the chloride-containing medium, the decolorization was accelerated greatly but the completed mineralization of AO7 was inhibited with the increasing of chloride ions concentration when these high-overvoltage anodes were used.									24	7	0	0	5	0	26			1023-1935	1608-3342		WOS:000258371800006

In many cases, the presence of nontransition metals, that is, s-, p-, and f-block metals with high natural abundance in the earth-crust in the catalytic material is indispensable to boost efficiency and durability in water electrolysis. This is why alkali metals, alkaline-earth metals, rare-earth metals, lean metals, and metalloids receive growing interest in this research area. In spite of the pivotal role of these nontransition metals in tuning efficiency of water electrolysis, there is far more room for developments toward a knowledge-based catalyst design. In this review, five classes of nontransition metals species which are successfully utilized in water electrolysis, with special emphasis on electronic structure-catalytic activity relationships and phase stability, are discussed. Moreover, specific fundamental aspects on electrocatalysts for water electrolysis as well as a perspective on this research field are also addressed in this account. It is anticipated that this review can trigger a broader interest in using s-, p-, and f-block metals species toward the discovery of advanced polymetal-containing electrocatalysts for practical water splitting.									13	0	0	0	0	0	13			0935-9648	1521-4095		WOS:000767636300001	35104388

Insight can be gained into the transition state of the DNA polymerization reaction by studying the behavior of various beta,gamma-bridging substituted methylene (CXY; X, Y = H, halo, methyl) or imido (NH) dNTP analogues that differ with regard to the pK(a4) of the bisphosphonate or imidodiphosphate leaving group. The apparent rate constant (k(pol)) of the polymerase ribozyme was determined for analogues of dGTP and dCTP that span a broad range of acidities for the leaving group, ranging from 7.8 for the CF2-bisphosphonate to 11.6 for the CHCH3-bisphosphonate. A Bronsted plot of log(k(pol)) versus pK(a4) of the leaving group demonstrates linear free energy relationships (LFERS) for dihalo-, monohalo-, and non-halogen-substituted analogues of the dNTPs, with negative slopes, as has been observed for DNA polymerase proteins. The unsubstituted dNTPs have a faster catalytic rate than would be predicted from consideration of the linear free energy relationship alone, presumably due to a relatively more favorable interaction of the beta,gamma-bridging oxygen within the active site. Although the DNA polymerase ribozyme is considerably slower than DNA polymerase proteins, it exhibits a similar LFER fingerprint, suggesting mechanistic commonality pertaining to the buildup of negative charge in the transition state, despite the very different chemical compositions of the two catalysts.									1	0	0	0	1	0	1			0006-2960			WOS:000610980900001	33356161

La2CoMnO6 material is a monoclinic perovskite at room temperature, adopting the space group P2(1)/n (a(-)a(-)b(+)), a approximate to b approximate to root 2a(p), c approximate to 2a(p) and Z = 2. The P2(1)/n phase can be described effectively by three distortion modes (GM(4)(+), X-3(+), X-5(+)) of the Fm (3) over barm (a(0)a(0)a(0)) parent phase. The comparative study of the material and those in the Ln(2)CoMnO(6) and Ln(2)NiMnO(6) families has shown a general trend in nearly all the materials, has served to select a common direction in the sub-space spanned by X-5(+), tri-linearly coupled to the order parameters of the cubic to monoclinic first order phase transition. This direction has been used to parametrize the refinements and to perform reliable refinements in the high-temperature intermediate distorted trigonal phase, R (3) over bar (a(-)a(-)a(-)), for which only one effectively acting irrep has been deduced: GM(5)(+), physically a tilt of the oxygen sharing octahedra of Co and Mn. Its temperature evolution up to the prototype cubic phase has been fitted in the framework of the Landau Theory of Phase Transitions, showing a behavior typical of a tricritical point. The low-temperature neutron powder diffraction data have served to solve the magnetic structure: three indistinguishable ferromagnetic models with the space groups P2(1)/n and P2'(1)/n' are proposed.									27	0	0	0	0	0	27			1477-9226	1477-9234		WOS:000359089100011	26146028

Unfortunately, the manipulation of baths containing chromate and its discharge during washing in the residual water oblige the industrial man to look for other solutions excluding chromate.Our views are to develop a coating for aluminium alloys utilizing relatively non-toxic chemicals that could serve as an alternative to chromate coating.It was found [1] that baths containing trivalent chromium sulfate and NaF, adjusted with NaOH to a pH near the precipitation of basic compounds, were capable to form light films on aluminium alloys with significant corrosion resistance. An oxidation post-treatment of Cr3+ to Cr6+, made by immersion of the pretreated aluminium alloy in a permanganate solution, enhance the corrosion resistance. An anodic oxidation, made under good conditions, should give the same results.We study this alternative to chromate conversion coating in our laboratory, and we propose to explain our encouraging results, such as the inhibition of the oxygen reduction reaction, the evolution of the pitting potential with treatments, the resistance to the filiform corrosion.					5th International Conference on Aluminium Alloys - Their Physical and Mechanical Properties (ICAA5)5th International Conference on Aluminium Alloys - Their Physical and Mechanical Properties (ICAA5)	JUL 01-05, 1996JUL 01-05, 1996	Soc Francaise Met & Mat; Inst Natl Polytech GrenobleSoc Francaise Met & Mat; Inst Natl Polytech Grenoble	GRENOBLE, FRANCEGRENOBLE, FRANCE	3	0	0	0	0	0	3			0255-5476		0-87849-757-9	WOS:A1997BH33X00027

However, critical questions about these materials remain largely unanswered: interfacial reactions and the evolution of the electrode material as delithiation takes place. Distinguishing between topotactic (i.e., reversible) intercalation, conversion, and alloying reactions in ion tunable vanadium oxide devices, in operando, at a resolution that matches the size of structural building units, is a particularly challenging task. In this work, we investigated the effects of lithiation on the structural and optical characteristics of a model thin film system - LixV2O5 - as a function of depth, using several highly sensitive and nondestructive spectroscopic methods with different depth sensitivities. We exploit (1) LixV2O5 electrochromic properties to utilize in operando optical response, (2) depth-resolved cathodoluminescence spectroscopy (DRCLS), and (3) Raman spectroscopy to monitor the changes in LixV2O5 electronic structure from the surface to the bulk of the thin film with nanoscale resolution. We find that the degradation of electrochemical performance with deep discharge of LixV2O5 is associated with drastic band structure changes that accompany octahedral distortion, rather than with a chemical conversion reaction. Elongation along the c axis and charge redistribution induced by varying levels of V(3d)-O(2p) hybridization in the presence of the Li considerably affect the electronic band structure. The coexistence of multiple metastable phases, strong electron correlation, and deviation from an ideal cubic symmetry results in lower structural reversibility with a higher bandgap. Beyond these specific inferences, these results suggest that these optical techniques-Raman, optical absorption/reflection, and cathodoluminescence-can be a powerful combination to reveal electrochemical behavior of ion-tunable transition metal oxides materials and associated reaction mechanisms.									10	0	0	0	0	0	10			0897-4756	1520-5002		WOS:000569075300012

However, 2D non-layered nanosheets have long been considered inaccessible by exfoliation due to the absence of anisotropy in the 3D bonding network. In this work, we have successfully exfoliated earth-abundant non-layered materials (e.g., goethite, galena and calcite) to atomically thin sheets and discovered that the orientations of the exfoliated nanosheets coincide with the cleavage orientations of pristine materials, for the first time, revealing the close correlation between the accessibility of 2D nanomaterials and the existence of cleavage planes. Cleavage plane-oriented exfoliation is achieved via anisotropic in- and out-of-plane bonding, based on which a class of non-layered metal oxides, sulfides and carbonates are exfoliated to access 2D nanomaterials. The as-fabricated ultrathin and surfactant-free 2D non-layered CoOOH exhibits a very low overpotential (245 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2)) for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), which is competitive to benchmark electrocatalysts, including synthetic CoOOH nanosheets. This work deciphers the atomic correlation of 2D-bulk orientation of non-layered materials, which provides a general approach for producing traditionally inaccessible 2D nanosheets with intriguing properties and functionalities for a variety of energy and other applications.									21	0	0	0	2	0	21			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000473054500046

The site is shown to be active in oxygen atom abstraction from N2O to form a highly reactive alpha-O, capable of methane activation at room temperature to form methanol. The methanol product can subsequently be desorbed by online steaming at 200 degrees C. For the intermediate steps of the reaction cycle, the evolution of the Fe active site is monitored by UV-vis-NIR and Mossbauer spectroscopy. A B3LYP-DFT model of the alpha-Fe site in CHA is constructed, and the ligand field transitions are calculated by CASPT2. The model is experimentally substantiated by the preferential formation of alpha-Fe over other Fe species, the requirement of paired framework aluminum and a MeOH/Fe ratio indicating a mononuclear active site. The simple CHA topology is shown to mitigate the heterogeneity of iron speciation found on other Fe-zeolites, with Fe2O3 being the only identifiable phase other than alpha-Fe formed in Fe-CHA. The alpha-Fe site is formed in the d6r composite building unit, which occurs frequently across synthetic and natural zeolites. Finally, through a comparison between alpha-Fe in Fe-CHA and Fe-*BEA, the topology's 6MR geometry is found to influence the structure, the ligand field, and consequently the spectroscopy of the alpha-Fe site in a predictable manner. Variations in zeolite topology can thus be used to rationally tune the active site properties.									50	1	0	0	5	0	50			0002-7863			WOS:000446142500022	30169036

Since aqueous NH4OH was used during doping instead of NH3 gas, the treatment step does not require complicated annealing facilities. Moreover, the state of doped N is a form of NH3-W instead of W2N, which lowers the bandgap but increases photocorrosion. We found that incorporation of NH4 into WO3 leads to reduction of the bandgap from 2.9 eV to 2.2 eV, regardless of the amount of NH4OH treatment, lowering the onset potential and increasing the current density at fixed potential for oxygen evolution reaction under illumination. Scanning electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction and Xray photoelectron spectroscopy were employed to investigate the surface morphologies, crystallinities of tungsten oxides and existence of NH4 doping, respectively. The bandgap energy was determined by UV-Vis spectroscopy to measure the transmittance and refraction. The water splitting performance of each sample was measured by electrochemical linear sweep voltammetry in a 3-electrode configuration under illumination. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Ngb, predominantly expressed in nerve cells, is of ancient evolutionary origin and is homologous to nerve-globins of invertebrates. Cygb, present in many different tissues, shares common ancestry with myoglobin (Mb) and can be traced to early vertebrate evolution. Ngb and Cygb display the classical three-on-three alpha-helical globin fold and are endowed with a hexa-coordinate heme Fe atom, in both their ferrous and ferric forms, having the heme distal HisE7 residue as the endogenous sixth ligand. Reversible intramolecular hexa- to penta-coordination of the heme Fe atom modulates Ngb and Cygb ligand-binding properties. In Ngb and Cygb, ligand migration to/from the heme distal site may be assisted by protein/matrix tunnel cavity systems. The physiological roles of Ngb and Cygb are poorly understood. Ngb may protect neuronal cells from hypoxic-ischemic insults, may act as oxidative stress-responsive sensor protein, and may sustain NO/O-2 scavenging and/or reactive oxygen species (ROS) detoxification. Cygb, located in the cytoplasm of fibroblasts, chondroblasts, osteoblasts, and hepatic stellate cells, has been hypothesized to be involved in collagen synthesis. In neurons, Cygb, located in both cytoplasm and nucleus, may provide O-2 for enzymatic reactions, and may be involved in a ROS (NO)-signaling pathway(s). Here, we review current knowledge on Ngb and Cygb in terms of their structure, function, and evolutionary links to the well-known human HbA and Mb.									39	0	0	0	31	0	39			1470-8175	1539-3429		WOS:000224176900002	21706744

ACTA GEOLOGICA SINICA-ENGLISH EDITION				85	6			1310	1335		10.1111/j.1755-6724.2011.00603.x				DEC 2011	2011	In Tunisia, five Bahloul spaced sections, Bargou, Jerisa, Guern Halfaya, Kherij and Gafsa were analyzed for biostratigraphy (foraminifera and radiolarians) and major and trace elements. This high-resolution biostratigraphic and chemostratigraphic integrated analyses for the Late Cenomanian-Early Turonian Bahloul Formation provide new insight into the palaeoceanographic evolution of the southern Tethyan margin. Relative low abundance of related terrigenous Ti/Al and K/Al ratios and enrichment of some productivity proxies such as Ba, Cu, and Ni (organic matter related trace elements) suggests that the Bahloul, deposited during a relatively short period (0.5 Ma), was of relatively elevated primary productivity and minimal detrital input. While higher D* values concurrent with lower Ti/Al ratios are interpreted as caused by enhanced fluvial material contribution, due to more humid climate during the OAE-2. Enhanced humidity triggered probably fluvial influxes, resulted in a sluggish water circulation and consequent anoxic/euxinic conditions favoring the preservation of organic matter at the bottom. Enrichments in redox-sensitive trace metals U, V, and Mo in the Bahloul Formation deposits and redox indices, such as V/(V+Ni), U/Th, V/Cr, and Ni/Co, indicate that oxygen-restricted conditions prevailed during the Late Cenomanian to earliest Turonian times and correlate well with relative abundances of some foraminiferal and radiolarian paleo-environmental relevant indicators. High Baxs values and Uauth may indicate anoxic conditions at least at the watersediment interface during the Bahloul Formation deposition and provide information about low to moderate sulfate-reduction reactions.									11	0	0	0	3	0	11			1000-9515	1755-6724		WOS:000298536400009

The morphology, structure and chemical composition of the catalyst were characterized by XRD, N-2 adsorption-desorption, SEM, EDS, TEM and XPS. The study of catalytic performance and reaction kinetics of organic matter degradation in acrylonitrile wastewater was performed in a catalytic wet peroxide (CWPO) system. The degradation pathways of organic matter in acrylonitrile wastewater were elucidated by temporal evolution of intermediates and final products detected by GC/MS analysis along with a continuous flow experiment study. The results show that the Ag/CeO2 has an ordered mesoporous structure, the specific surface area is 91.4-118.2 m(2) g(-1) and the average pore size is 12.63-16.86 nm. 0.4-Ag/CeO2 showed the best catalytic performance, the COD removal rate reached 94.6%, which was 30% higher than that of CeO2. The degradation is in accordance with the second-order reaction kinetics of the Arrhenius empirical model and Langmuir-Hinshelwood kinetic model. However the latter fits better, and the linear correlation coefficient R-2 is more than 0.98, which describes the adsorption catalytic mechanism of Ag/CeO2. According to the analysis by GC/MS, the organic compounds in acrylonitrile wastewater oxidized into intermediate compounds and other small compounds, then are further oxidized into carbon dioxide and water. The catalytic activity of Ag/CeO2 was the result of the combination of Lewis acid-base position of CeO2 and redox cycle of Ce3+/Ce4+.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0				2046-2069		WOS:000649193500049	35481213

Herein, by highlighting the role of H4IO6-, we reinvestigated the pH effect on the decontamination performance of the H2O2/periodate process. Results revealed that elevating pH from 2.0 to 10.0 could markedly accelerate the rates of organic contaminant decay but decrease the amounts of organic contaminant removal. This pH-dependent trend of organic contaminant degradation corresponded well with the HO center dot yield and the variation of periodate species. Specifically, although O-1(2) could be detected at pH 9.0, HO center dot was determined to be the major reactive oxidizing species in the H2O2/periodate process under all the tested pH levels. Furthermore, it was suggested that only H4IO6- and H2I2O104- could serve as the precursors of HO center dot. The second-order rate constant for the reaction of H2I2O104- species with H2O2 was determined to be similar to 1199.5 M-1 s(-1) at pH 9.0, which was two orders of magnitude greater than that of H4IO6- (similar to 2.2 M-1 s(-1) at pH 3.0). Taken together, the reaction pathways of H2O2 with different periodate species were proposed. These fundamental findings could improve our understanding of the periodate-based advanced oxidation processes.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0013-936X	1520-5851		WOS:000829268900001	35795970

Therefore, a novel strategy is conceived to synthesize a hierarchical Co3O4/MnO(2 )composite material which broadens the window voltage of the supercapacitors greatly. The MnO2 nanosheets are covered on the surface of Co-MOF-drived Co3O4 nanocages. The morphology and coverage density of MnO2 can be adjusted by the amount of KMnO4. The optimized electrode Co3O4/MnO2-3 exhibits excellent specific capacitance (292 F g(-1) at 4 A g(-1)) and remarkable cycling stability (87.4% retention after 5000 cycles) in 1 M Na2SO4 aqueous electrolyte when the working voltage extends to 1.4 V (vs Ag/AgCl). Furthermore, Asymmetric aqueous supercapacitors assembled with Co3O4/MnO2 as the cathode and activated carbon as the anode displays maximal window voltage of 2.4 V with negligible oxygen evolution reaction, high energy density (46.2 W h kg(-1)) and excellent cycling stability (84.5% capacitance retention after 5000 cycles). The LED is successfully lit by only one device without any other energy assistance.									39	2	0	0	1	0	39			0378-7753	1873-2755		WOS:000474500700007

In-situ heterojunction will be an effective way for enhancing charge transfer rate since the tight interface, which is conductive to promote the photoelectrochemical or photochemical activity. Herein, 0D/2D SnO2/SnS2 novel Step-scheme (S-scheme) heterojunctions have been successfully constructed by solvothermal method and in-situ oxidation technique through controlling the annealed temperature in N-2/H-2 atmosphere. The SnS2 nanosheets annealed at 400 degrees C (SS-400) reveals the highest photocurrent density (0.33 mA cm(-2)) at 1.23 V vs. RHE under AM 1.5G, that is approximately of 1.9 and 1.2 times than SS-300 (0.17 mA cm(-2)) and SS-500 (0.27 mA cm(-2)), respectively. The SS-400 shows the hydrogen and oxygen evolution of 5.5 and 2.7 mu mol cm(-2) h(-1), and the corresponding faradaic efficiencies are about 89.4% and 87.7%, respectively. The mainly enhanced reason of SS-400 is that appropriate amount of 0D SnO2 nanoparticles generated on the surfaces and edges of 2D SnS2 nanosheets fabricate the in-situ of S-scheme heterojunctions, which are accelerating the recombination of carriers with relatively weaker redox capacity and promoting the separation of carriers with relatively stronger redox capacity. Meantime, the barrier factor, internal electric field, coulomb interaction, and applied bias factors can also promote the recombination of carriers with weak redox capacity (electrons of SnO2 and holes of SnS2). This work will provide a novel thought for designing and constructing the mechanism of S-scheme heterojunctions for photoelectrochemical water splitting.									63	3	0	0	4	0	63			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000504658100038		
J	Rai, Rahul; Weaver, Jason F.								Methanol oxidation on stoichiometric and oxygen-rich RuO2(110)								PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY CHEMICAL PHYSICS				19	29			18975	18987		10.1039/c7cp03143b				AUG 7 2017	2017	We used temperature-programmed reaction spectroscopy (TPRS) to investigate the adsorption and oxidation of methanol on stoichiometric and O-rich RuO2(110) surfaces. We find that the complete oxidation of CH3OH is strongly preferred on stoichiometric RuO2(110) during TPRS for initial CH3OH coverages below similar to 0.33 ML (monolayer), and that partial oxidation to mainly CH2O becomes increasingly favored with increasing CH3OH coverage from 0.33 to 1.0 ML. We present evidence that an adsorbed CH2O2 species serves as the key intermediate to complete oxidation and that CH2O2 formation is intrinsically facile but becomes limited by the availability of bridging O-atoms on stoichiometric RuO2(110) at initial CH3OH coverages above 0.33 ML. We show that methanol molecules adsorbed in excess of 0.33 ML dehydrogenate to mainly CH2O and desorb during TPRS, with adsorbed CH3O groups mediating the evolution of both CH2O and CH3OH. We find that O-rich RuO2(110) surfaces are also highly active toward methanol oxidation and that selectivity toward the complete oxidation of methanol increases markedly with increasing coverage of on-top O-atoms (Oot) on RuO2(110). Our results demonstrate that CH3OH species adsorbed within O-ot-rich domains react efficiently during TPRS, in parallel with reaction of CH3OH adsorbed initially on cus-Ru sites. The data suggests that the facile hydrogenation of O-ot atoms and the resulting desorption of H2O at low-temperature (< similar to 400 K) provides an efficient pathway for restoring reactive O-atoms and thereby promoting complete oxidation of methanol on the O-rich RuO2(110) surface.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			1463-9076	1463-9084		WOS:000406334300017	28702542

Nevertheless, achieving efficient PEC water oxidation process through BiVO4 photoanode still faces serious challenge such as severe electron-hole recombination. In this case, PEC activity of BiVO4 photoanode was enhanced by decoration of three-dimensional CoMn-layered double hydroxide (CoMn-LDH) nanoflakes on the BiVO4 surface via a facile electrodeposition process. It was suggested that CoMn-LDH played a synergistic effect on broadening internal light absorption, which accelerated injection of holes carrier to electrolyte and alleviated the electron-hole recombination, resulting in expediting faster PEC water oxidation reaction kinetics. Consequently, the photocurrent density of BiVO4/CoMn-LDH photoanode achieved 2.69 mA cm(-2) at 1.23 V-RHE, 2.45 times higher than the pristine BiVO4. What's more, 220 mV negative-shift took place on onset potential that was further decreased to 0.31 V-RHE. The vastly enhanced PEC performance was also prioritized to those of Co and Mn single relatives. This work demonstrated that the synergistic BiVO4/CoMn-LDH as a capable candidate material, can be utilized for effective PEC water splitting. (C) 2020 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC.

Here we show the fabrication of bismuth vanadate (BiVO4) thin films using a simple and scalable method called SILAR (Successive Ionic Layer Adsorption and Reaction), which is based on a series of immersion cycles in different precursor solutions. We present a comprehensive study on the growth of BiVO4 layers, assessing the role of the deposition parameters on the structural, morphological, optical and electronic properties of the deposited films. We demonstrate the fabrication of phase pure BiVO4 coatings showing excellent crystallinity and tuneable absorption properties, with band gap ranging between 2.8 and 2.4 eV. We then assessed these films as photoanodes for photoelectrochemical water oxidation, demonstrating the interplay of the synthesis parameters (precursor concentration, number of immersion cycles, annealing temperature) in affecting the water splitting performance. Champion samples were combined with a conventional co-catalyst for the oxygen evolution reaction and tested under simulated sunlight, recording photocurrents of 4.4 mA cm(-2) (at 1.23 V vs. RHE, the reversible hydrogen electrode) in borate buffer with the presence of a hole scavenger, with only a small reduction to 3.9 mA cm(-2) when tested without the hole scavenger. Our BiVO4 are amongst the best performing photoanodes, and this study further promotes ongoing work focused on optimizing BiVO4 to enhance its performance for water splitting applications.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000718464400001

Only a small region encompassing the active site was explicitly included in the calculations, but the electrical contribution of most outer atoms was taken into account by adding to the effective potential a term coming from an electrostatic potential grid that was pre-calculated and used to approximate the electrostatic energy and the force at any point in the interacting site. Results of simulating the intermolecular hydrogen bond network agree fairly well with X-ray experiments. An estimation of the direct and water-mediated interaction mean lifetimes and mean water residence times around the T-antigen oxygen atoms was computed over 400 ps. Monitoring the behaviour of water molecules within the active site revealed that there is a constant exchange of water with the bulk, especially in the proximity of ASN41, ASN127 and GLU129. The temporal evolution of the glycosidic linkage was also investigated and compared with simulations of T-antigen in solution. These studies of peanut lectins-sugar complexes clearly emphasize the importance of bound water molecules in generating carbohydrate specificity. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Inc.

The sharp color change and appearance of representative absorption peaks in the UV- visible spectra confirm the quick reduction of the Ag salt and evolution of Ag NPs. Morphological and structural aspects showed that the resulting Ag NPs are highly crystalline with an average size of 16 nm. Furthermore, compositional analysis of the extract confirmed the existence of active bioreducing and stabilizing agents in the Fagonia cretica extract. Furthermore, various concentrations of AgNO3 and the Fagonia cretica extract were employed to obtain a higher yield with better stability of Ag NPs. The resulting Ag NPs showed effective antibacterial activity against Proteus vulgaris, Escherichia coli, and Klebsiella pneumoniae. It is found that the Ag NPs inducemaximum production of reactive oxygen species ( ROS) in Proteus vulgaris as compared to Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae which induce cell toxicity, while ROS production in the presence of Ag NPs is 30% higher than that in the presence of only the plant extract and control in all three bacterial strains. Thus, present findings show that plant extracts can be a useful natural resource to prepare functional nanomaterials for targeted applications especially in the field of biotechnology.									31	0	0	0	6	0	32			2516-0230			WOS:000477090200007	36134229

The present study addresses the fundamental aspects of the catalyzed growth of nano-graphites in C-Bi-Fe systems, relevant in charge transport and thermo-chemical processes. The thermal evolution of a C-Bi-Fe xerogel is investigated using different pyrolysis treatments. At lower temperatures (similar to 750 degrees C), hybrid bismuth iron oxide (BFO) NPs are frequently observed, while graphitization manifests under more specific conditions such as higher temperatures (similar to 1,050 degrees C) and reduction yields. An in situ heating TEM experiment reveals graphitization activity between 800 and 900 degrees C. NP motion is directly correlated with textural changes of the carbon support due to the catalyzed growth of graphitic nano shells and nanofibers as confirmed by HR-TEM and electron tomography (ET) for the graphitized sample. An exponential growth model for the catalyst dynamics enables the approximation of activation energies as 0.68 and 0.29-0.34 eV during reduction and graphitization stages.

In both heterotrophic and autotrophic organisms, plastids and/or mitochondria require extensive organelle-to-nucleus communication in order to establish a coordinated expression of their own genomes with the nuclear genome, which encodes the majority of the components of these organelles. This goal is achieved by the use of a variety of signals that inform the cell nucleus about the number and developmental status of the organelles and their reaction to changing external environments. Such signals have been identified in both photosynthetic and non-photosynthetic eukaryotes (known as retrograde signalling and retrograde response, respectively) and, therefore, appear to be universal mechanisms acting in eukaryotes of all kingdoms. In particular, chloroplasts and mitochondria both harbour crucial redox reactions that are the basis of eukaryotic life and are, therefore, especially susceptible to stress from the environment, which they signal to the rest of the cell. These signals are crucial for cell survival, lifespan and environmental adjustment, and regulate quality control and targeted degradation of dysfunctional organelles, metabolic adjustments, and developmental signalling, as well as induction of apoptosis. The functional similarities between retrograde signalling pathways in autotrophic and non-autotrophic organisms are striking, suggesting the existence of common principles in signalling mechanisms or similarities in their evolution. Here, we provide a survey for the newcomers to this field of research and discuss the importance of retrograde signalling in the context of eukaryotic evolution. Furthermore, we discuss commonalities and differences in retrograde signalling mechanisms and propose retrograde signalling as a general signalling mechanism in eukaryotic cells that will be also of interest for the specialist.This article is part of the theme issue 'Retrograde signalling from endosymbiotic organelles'.									16	0	0	0	13	0	16			0962-8436	1471-2970		WOS:000531411500004	32362267

In this paper, cotton was impregnated in CoCl2 aqueous solution. Co2+ can be uniformly adsorbed on cotton fibers. After been freeze-dried, the Co2+-adsorbed cotton was carbonized under an inert atmosphere and the Co nano-particles (NPs) modified cotton derived carbon fibers (Co/CCF) were obtained. The Co/CCF was then dispersed in RuCl3 aqueous solution, so that Ru3+ can be reduced by metallic Co NPs through spontaneous replacement reaction and covered on Co NPs surface. Hence, the Ru@Co/CCF catalyst was prepared with low Ru loading in the view of Ru saving. In the catalytic hydrolysis of ammonia borane (NH3 center dot BH3, AB), the Ru@Co/CCF catalyst showed excellent catalytic activity as compared with Ru/CCF and many other noble metal based catalysts. The superior activity of the catalyst is mainly due to the highly dispersed Ru@Co NPs on the carbon fibers and the uniform covering of the metallic Ru on the surface of Co NPs. Moreover, owing to the magnetic core of the Ru@Co NPs, Ru@Co/CCF catalyst can be easily separated from the reaction system using an external magnetic field. Thus, this work provided a useful strategy for facile preparation of low precious metals loading catalysts using cheap and environmental starting material as catalyst support precursor material.

Most previous studies on Notch have focused on mammals, whereas, in this study, we employed the shrimp Litopenaeus vannamei as a model to study the functions of Notch in invertebrate innate immune system. Our results showed that LvNotch was highly expressed in hemocytes and could be strongly induced by lipopolysaccharides (LPS) injection. Small interfering RNA (siRNA)-mediated knockdown of LvNotch could significantly increase LPS induced L vannamei mortality, which might be due to the fact that LPS induced ROS was greatly enhanced in LvNotch knockdown shrimps. Further, quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) analysis revealed that LvNotch could affect the expression of multiple genes, including dorsal, relish, antilipopolysaccharide factor 1 (ALF1), ALF3 and NADH dehydrogenases which were upregulated, and Hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF, alpha/beta) which were downregulated in LPS treated shrimps. In summary, LvNotch is important in the control of inflammation-induced ROS production in shrimp. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

As nitrogen is a biochemically essential element, sources of biochemically accessible nitrogen, especially reduced nitrogen, are critical to prebiotic chemistry and the origin of life. Loss of atmospheric nitrogen can result in loss of the ability to sustain liquid water on a planetary surface, which would impact planetary habitability and hydrological processes that shape the surface. It is known that NO can be photochemically converted through a chain of reactions to form nitrate and nitrite, which can be subsequently reduced to ammonia. Here, we show that NO can also be directly reduced, by FeS, to ammonia. In addition to removing nitrogen from the atmosphere, this reaction is particularly important as a source of reduced nitrogen on an early terrestrial planet. By converting NO directly to ammonia in a single step, ammonia is formed with a higher product yield (similar to 50%) than would be possible through the formation of nitrate/nitrite and subsequent conversion to ammonia. In conjunction with the reduction of NO, there is also a catalytic disproportionation at the mineral surface that converts NO to NO2 and N2O. The NO2 is then converted to ammonia, while the N2O is released back in the gas phase, which provides an abiotic source of nitrous oxide.									24	1	0	0	14	0	25			1531-1074	1557-8070		WOS:000300523100003	22283408

With the aim of in-situ reaction design during LMD processing, a trace of oxygen mixed with the shielding gas was introduced. Different "laser energy input per unit length" (E) by changing the laser power was set to investigate the influence on the deposition quality and attendant microstructure and mechanical property of the LMD-processed layer. TiO2 particles with unique flower-like structure formed when the applied laser energy E <= 96 kJ/m, while the apparent oxidation of grain boundaries was observed as E increased to 120 kJ/m. The formation mechanism of in-situ TiO2 particles with a flower-like structure was present. At the optimized process parameter of 96 kJ/m, the LMD-processed layer showed the highest densification degree free of any pores and cracks. The corresponding mechanical properties were measured, showing the relatively high average microhardness of HVa2 790 and significantly improved tribological property containing lower coefficient of friction of 0.4 and more smooth worn surface.

The most stable adsorption structure involves ion-pair interactions between the protonated amino acid and the anionic zeolite framework. The adsorption energy is computed to be -31.3 and -34.8 kcal/mol for glycine and L-alanine, respectively. Two hydrogen bonded complexes are identified: one is the cyclic double hydrogen bonded complex via the interactions of the carboxyl group and the zeolite acid site having adsorption energies of -25.4 and -30.0 kcal/mol for glycine and L-alanine, respectively. The second is the hydrogen bonded complex via the interactions of the hydroxyl group and the zeolite acid site having weak interaction energies, -20.7 and -23.9 kcal/mol for glycine and L-alanine, respectively. The zwitterion form is not found in the acidic H-ZSM-5 due to the acid-base reaction, but the glycine zwitterion is found to be stably adsorbed on the Na-ZSM-5 with the adsorption energy of -24.8 kcal/mol. In addition to the interactions with the Bronsted acid site of the zeolite, the interactions with the nearby oxygen framework and van der Waals interactions with the zeolite walls are also found to be important for stabilizing the adsorbed amino acids and zwitterion, suggesting the role of the zeolite framework as a "solid solvent molecule".

Herein, active photosynthetic Chlorophyceae (Chlorella, Chl) functionalized with black phosphorus nanosheets (BPNSs) through polyaspartic acid (PASP) and Fe3+ mediating "Lego building method " are utilized for photocatalyzed oxygen-evolving to realize photosynthesis enhanced synergistic photodynamic/chemodynamic/immune therapy. The Chl cells with inherent photosynthesis and distinct me-tabolites are able to ameliorate tumor hypoxia, enhance immune cells infiltration, and stimulate the proliferation and maturation of immune cells. BPNSs loaded on the surface of Chl cells construct a type-II heterojunction with the chlorophyll in Chl cells, which improves the conversion efficiency of light through thoroughly separating photo-excited electrons and holes for O-1(2) generation and O-2 evolution, respectively. Additionally, the lock be-tween "Lego bricks ", Fe3+, can both consume glutathione (GSH) and catalyze Fenton reaction with H2O2 to generate .OH, mediating chemodynamic therapy (CDT). Moreover, Chl@BP-Fe also exhibited high biocompat-ibility and potential biodegradability, guaranteeing high potential for clinic applications of this synergistic photodynamic/chemodynamic/immune therapy.									8	0	0	0	1	0	8			0168-3659	1873-4995		WOS:000793733100004	35381273

Free heme is in the form of hematin (Fe3+ protoporphyrin IX OH) and follows several pathways of biochemical toxicity to tissues, cells, and organelles since it catalyzes the production of reactive oxygen species. To determine concentration of soluble free heme in human erythrocytes, we develop a new method. We lyse the red blood cells and isolate free heme from hemoglobin by dialysis. We use the heme to reconstitute horseradish peroxidase (HRP) from an excess of the apoenzyme and determine the HRP reaction rate from the evolution of the emitted luminescence. We find that in a population of five healthy adults the average free heme concentration in the erythrocytes is 21 +/- 2 mu M, ca. 100x higher than previously determined. Tests suggest that the lower previous value was due to the use of elevated concentrations of NaCl, which drive hematin precipitation and re-association with apoglobin. We show that the found hematin concentration is significantly higher than estimates based on equilibrium release and the known hematin dimerization. The factors that lead to enhanced heme release remain an open question. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.									27	0	0	0	16	0	27			1079-9796	1096-0961		WOS:000363358100020	26460266

These so-called bleaching events are most often related to an increase in water temperature, which is thought to limit certain Symbiodinium phylotypes from effectively dissipating absorbed excitation energy that is otherwise used for photochemistry. Here, we examined photosynthetic characteristics and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) production, a possible signal involved in bleaching, from two Symbiodinium types (a thermally "tolerant" A1 and "sensitive" B1) representative of cnidaria-Symbiodinium symbioses of reef-building Caribbean corals. Under steady-state growth at 26 degrees C, a higher efficiency of PSII photochemistry, rate of electron turnover, and rate of O-2 production were observed for type A1 than for B1. The two types responded very differently to a period of elevated temperature (32 degrees C): type A1 increased light-driven O-2 consumption but not the amount of H2O2 produced; in contrast, type B1 increased the amount of H2O2 produced without an increase in light-driven O-2 consumption. Therefore, our results are consistent with previous suggestions that the thermal tolerance of Symbiodinium is related to adaptive constraints associated with photosynthesis and that sensitive phylotypes are more prone to H2O2 production. Understanding these adaptive differences in the genus Symbiodinium will be crucial if we are to interpret the response of symbiotic associations, including reef-building corals, to environmental change.									148	0	0	0	136	0	148			0022-3646	1529-8817		WOS:000258099000013	27041613

However, this strategy is restricted by insufficient light harvesting and high photogenerated electron-hole recombination rates of TiO2-based photocatalysts. Here, a graphene-modified WO3/TiO2 step-scheme heterojunction (S-scheme heterojunction) composite photocatalyst was fabricated by a facile one-step hydrothermal method. In the ternary composite, TiO2 and WO3 nanoparticles adhered closely to reduced graphene oxide (rGO) and formed a novel S-scheme heterojunction. Moreover, rGO in the composite not only supplied abundant adsorption and catalytically active sites as an ideal support but also promoted electron separation and transfer from the conduction band of TiO2 by forming a Schottky junction between TiO2 and rGO. The positive cooperative effect of the S-scheme heterojunction formed between WO3 and TiO2 and the Schottky heterojunction formed between TiO2 and graphene sheets suppressed the recombination of relatively useful electrons and holes. This effect also enhanced the light harvesting and promoted the reduction reaction at the active sites. Thus, the novel ternary WO3/TiO2/rGO composite demonstrated a remarkably enhanced photocatalytic H-2 evolution rate of 245.8 Fmol g(-1) h(-1), which was approximately 3.5-fold that of pure TiO2. This work not only presents a low-cost graphene-based S-scheme heterojunction photocatalyst that was obtained via a feasible one-step hydrothermal approach to realize highly efficient H-2 generation without using noble metals, but also provides new insights into the design of novel heterojunction photocatalysts.

The properties of these nanostructures were discovered and characterized by a combination of analytical techniques, being TEM, SEM, EDX, XRD, XPS, and BET. While the urea-stabilized MgCo2O4 (U-MgCo2O4) nanostructures have spiky morphology, the NTA-stabilized ones (NTA-MgCo2O4) have wire-like structures. The synthesized nanostructures were utilized to modify glassy carbon electrodes (GCEs), and the electrochemical activities of the modified electrodes in water oxidation reactions were investigated in an alkaline medium by recording linear sweep voltammograms (LSVs). Even though both modified GCEs had almost the same onset potentials (1.67V vs. RHE for U-MgCo2O4/GCE and 1.63V vs. RHE for NTA-MgCo2O4/GCE), NTA-MgCo2O4/GCE required a lower overpotential (463mV vs. 573mV) to drive 10 mA cm(-2) catalytic current density. Besides being catalytically more active than U-MgCo2O4/GCE, NTA-MgCo2O4/GCE was also found to be more stable in constant potential electrolysis. Moreover, it demonstrated a comparable performance to that of RuO2 and has the advantage of being significantly economic.[GRAPHICS].									8	0	0	0	1	0	8			0021-891X	1572-8838		WOS:000459178400008		
J	Vladimirova, O; Lu, FM; Shawver, L; Kalman, B								The activation of protein kinase C induces higher production of reactive oxygen species by mononuclear cells in patients with multiple sclerosis than in controls								INFLAMMATION RESEARCH				48	7			412	416		10.1007/s000110050480				JUL 1999	1999	Objective: Recent findings have increasingly shown the importance of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in causing oxidative damage to macromolecules and in contributing to tissue degeneration in target organs of autoimmune diseases. This study was aimed at comparing the base line and induced production of ROS by peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PB MNCs) of patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) in remission and relapse, of patients with other neurological diseases (OND) and of healthy controls. In addition, we analyzed the underlying mechanism of ROS production.Methods: PB MNCs were separated from 28 MS patients in remission and 13 in relapse, and from 29 healthy controls and 10 OND. ROS was measured by spectrofluorometry. Expression of proinflammatory cytokines was assessed by semiquantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Mitochondrial (mt) DNA haplotypes were determined by using restriction site polymorphism analysis.Results: The base line and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha or interferon (IFN)-gamma induced ROS values were similar in the four groups, and the individual measures did not show a correlation with MS associated mtDNA haplotypes. Phorbol ester activation of protein kinase C (PKC) induced higher ROS production in all groups, however, with significantly greater values in the MS remission group. Calphostine C, a PKC inhibitor decreased or eliminated ROS production in a dose-dependent manner, suggesting further that it was predominantly or exclusively generated by PKC activated NADPH oxidase. A trend of increased TNF-alpha and IFN-gamma expression was noted in the MS relapse group, in contrast to the high ROS release in the MS remission group.Conclusion: The detected phase difference between the highest ROS production vs TNF-alpha expression is compatible with the hypothesis that different subpopulations of monocytes/macrophages are involved. We suggest that the ROS producing subpopulation preferentially migrates into the central nervous system (CNS) during a relapse. The present study together with our previous observation on oxidative damage to DNA in active plaques delineates a molecular pathway likely involved in the histologic evolution of inflammatory demyelination.									46	0	0	0	39	1	48			1023-3830			WOS:000081691400009	10450792

At take-over, adult tissues undergo diffuse apoptosis and effete cells are massively ingested by circulating phagocytes, with a consequent increase in oxygen consumption and in production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). The latter are responsible for the death of phagocytes involved in the clearance of apoptotic cells and corpses by phagocytosis-induced apoptosis. However, the majority of phagocytes and hemocytes do not die, even if they experience oxidative stress. This fact suggests the presence of detoxification mechanisms assuring their protection. To test this assumption, we searched for transcripts of genes involved in detoxification in the transcriptome of B. schlosseri. We identified and characterized transcripts for Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase (SOD),.glutamyl-cysteine ligase modulatory subunit (GCLM), gluta-thione synthase (GS), and two glutathione peroxidases (i.e., GPx3 and GPx5), all involved in protection from ROS. We also carried out a phylogenetic analysis of the putative amino acid sequences, confirming their similarity to their vertebrate counterparts, and studied the location of their mRNAs by in situ hybridization on hemocyte monolayers. We also analyzed gene transcription during the colonial blastogenetic cycle, which is the interval of time between one take-over and the next, by qRT-PCR. In addition, we investigated the effects of cadmium (Cd), an inducer of oxidative stress, on gene transcription. Our results indicated that i) antioxidant gene expression is modulated in the course of the blastogenetic cycle and upon exposure to Cd, and ii) hemocytes synthesize both enzymatic and nonenzymatic antioxidants, in line with the idea that they represent a major detoxification system for ascidians.									8	0	0	0	7	0	8			0006-3185	1939-8697		WOS:000400165700006	28445096

After each aging step the dispersion was evaluated by CO chemisorptions and the activity of the catalyst for NO oxidation was measured using 500 ppm NO and 8%O-2 diluted in Ar. After a degreening step at 500 degrees C, aging was performed at 600, 700,800 and 900 degrees C. Five wash-coated cordierite monoliths were aged in Ar, 10% O-2, 1% H-2 30 ppm SO2 and 30 ppm SO2 + 10% O-2, respectively. The general trend showed a linear decrease in dispersion when increasing the aging temperature for the lower aging temperatures and for the highest ones the dispersion levels off. When the platinum dispersion decreased the NO oxidation activity increased, due to that the reaction is structure sensitive. H-2 seemed to hinder sintering at low aging temperature. Interestingly, after aging in 10% oxygen at 600 degrees C the NO oxidation activity was significantly higher compared to the Ar aged sample, although the dispersions were similar. Aging in oxygen at higher temperatures resulted in a decrease of dispersion and a slightly decreasing NO oxidation activity. Moreover lower dispersion limit was reached with oxygen aging. Aging in SO2 provoked a severe dispersion drop at low aging temperature meanwhile the activity increased only moderately. However, activity kept increasing with further treatments at higher temperature. The combination of O-2 and SO2 enabled to decrease rapidly the dispersion and to greatly enhance the catalytic NO oxidation activity after the first aging step at only 600 degrees C. The best overall conversion was obtained for the catalyst treated with this mixture after aging at 800 degrees C. A 22-h aging at 250 degrees C in a mixture containing 500 ppm NO, 10% O-2 and 30 ppm SO2 led to a significant decrease of Pt dispersion, which shows the ability of SO2 to promote platinum sintering already 250 degrees C. The low temperature sintering was confirmed with STEM measurements. Several larger particles were observed, but also many small particles remained. Thus the SO2 + O-2 induced low temperature sintering results in a large variation of particle sizes. This treatment resulted in an increase of the maximum NO conversion (after reduction of the sample) from 45% to 76%. The different aging experiments show that it is beneficial to add SO2 during aging and the reason is the increased particle size, but also a clear chemical effect was observed. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Our results showed that the effects of Cu2+ and Zn2+ on growth, photosynthetic pigments (chlorophylls and carotenoids), phycobiliprotein and metabolism (the fluorescence emission spectra and the activities of photosystem.) did not follow the same pattern. The relative growth rate was inhibited by different concentrations of Cu2+, and was slightly increased at lower concentrations (up to 10 mu M) and inhibited at higher Zn2+ concentrations. On the other hand, the phycoerythrin contents were slightly increased at relatively low concentrations (up to 1 mu M Cu2+ or 20 mu M Zn2+) and inhibited by high Cu2+ and Zn2+ concentrations. Moreover, photosynthesis and respiration showed an increase in the amount of oxygen exchange in response to relatively low Cu2+ (up to 1 mu M) and Zn2+ concentrations (up to 10 mu M), and a reduction to relatively high Cu2+ and Zn2+ concentrations. Oxygen evolution was more sensitive than oxygen uptake to Cu2+ and Zn2+. In addition, the photoreductive activities and fluorescence emission of photosystem II (PS II) were enhanced by lower concentrations of Cu2+ (up to 0.1 mu M) and Zn2+ (up to 10 mu M) and inhibited by higher concentrations. Furthermore, the intensity of chlorophyll a fluorescence and the active PSII reaction centers followed a similar pattern in response to elevated concentrations of Cu2+ and Zn2+. These results suggest that lower concentrations of Cu2+ and Zn2+ affected the metabolism of P. haitanesis, which was inhibited by higher concentrations of these metals.									7	0	0	0	7	0	8			1679-8759	1982-436X		WOS:000287141100001		
J	Lambeth, J. David								Nox enzymes, ROS, and chronic disease: An example of antagonistic pleiotropy								FREE RADICAL BIOLOGY AND MEDICINE				43	3			332	347		10.1016/j.freeradbiomed.2007.03.027				AUG 1 2007	2007	Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are considered to be chemically reactive with and damaging to biomolecules including DNA, protein, and lipid, and excessive exposure to ROS induces oxidative stress and causes genetic mutations. However, the recently described family of Nox and Duox enzymes generates ROS in a variety of tissues as part of normal physiological functions, which include innate immunity, signal transduction, and biochemical reactions, e.g., to produce thyroid hormone. Nature's "choice" of ROS to carry out these biological functions seems odd indeed, given its predisposition to cause molecular damage. This review describes normal biological roles of Nox enzymes as well as pathological conditions that are associated with ROS production by Nox enzymes. By far the most common conditions associated with Nox-derived ROS are chronic diseases that tend to appear late in life, including atherosclerosis, hypertension, diabetic nephropathy, lung fibrosis, cancer, Alzheimer's disease, and others. In almost all cases, with the exception of a few rare inherited conditions (e.g., related to innate immunity, gravity perception, and hypothyroidism), diseases are associated with overproduction of ROS by Nox enzymes; this results in oxidative stress that damages tissues over time. I propose that these pathological roles of Nox enzymes can be understood in terms of antagonistic pleiotropy: genes that confer a reproductive advantage early in life can have harmful effects late in life. Such genes are retained during evolution despite their harmful effects, because the force of natural selection declines with advanced age. This review discusses some of the proposed physiologic roles of Nox enzymes, and emphasizes the role of Nox enzymes in disease and the likely beneficial effects of drugs that target Nox enzymes, particularly in chronic diseases associated with an aging population.

In the present work, we examined the effect of transition and non-transition divalent metal ions on FIOC in Mn-depleted PSII (apo-WOC-PSII) preparations. It was shown that only Mn2+ ions are able to activate FIOC while other transition metal ions (Fe2+, V2+ and Cr2+) capable of electron donation to the apo-WOC-PSII suppressed the photoconsumption of O-2. Co2+ ions with a high redox potential (E (0) for Co2+/Co3+ is 1.8 V) showed no effect. Non-transition metal ions Ca2+ by Mg2+ did not stimulate FIOC. However, Ca2+ (in contrast to Mg2+) showed an additional activation effect in the presence of exogenic Mn2+. The Ca2+ effect depended on the concentration of both Mn2+ and Ca2+. The Ca effect was only observed when: (1) the activation of FIOC induced by Mn2+ did not reach its maximum, (2) the concentration of Ca2+ did not exceed 40 mu M; at higher concentrations Ca2+ inhibited the Mn2+-activated O-2 photoconsumption. Replacement of Ca2+ by Mg2+ led to a suppression of Mn2+-activated O-2 photoconsumption; while, addition of Ca2+ resulted in elimination of the Mg2+ inhibitory effect and activation of FIOC. Thus, only Mn2+ and Ca2+ (which are constituents of the WOC) have specific effects of activation of FIOC in apo-WOC-PSII preparations. Possible reactions involving Mn2+ and Ca2+ which could lead to the activation of FIOC in the apo-WOC-PSII are discussed.									5	0	1	0	5	0	6			0166-8595	1573-5079		WOS:000326604900025	23756831	
J	vanVliet, P; Rutherford, AW				Rutherford, Alfred W/A-7831-2019	Rutherford, Alfred W/0000-0002-3124-154X			Properties of the chloride-depleted oxygen-evolving complex of photosystem II studied by electron paramagnetic resonance								BIOCHEMISTRY				35	6			1829	1839		10.1021/bi9514471				FEB 13 1996	1996	The effects of different Cl- depletion treatments in photosystem II (PS-II)-enriched membranes have been investigated by electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy and by measurements of oxygen-evolving activity. The results indicated that the oxygen-evolving complex of PS-II exhibits two distinct Cl-dependent properties. (1) After Cl-free washes at pH 6.3, a reversibly altered distribution of structural states of PS-II was observed, manifested as the appearance of a g = 4 EPR signal from the S-2 State in a significant fraction of centers (20-40%) at the expense of the S-2 multiline signal. In addition, small but significant changes in the shape of the S-2 multiline EPR signal were observed. Reconstitution of Cl- to Cl-free washed PS-II rapidly reversed the observed effects of the Cl-free washing. The anions, SO42- and F-, which are often used during C-l- depletion treatments, had no effect on the S-2 EPR properties of PS-II under these conditions in the absence or presence of Cl-. Flash experiments and measurements of oxygen evolution versus light intensity indicated that the two structural states observed after the removal of C-l- at pH 6.3 originated from oxygen-evolving centers exhibiting a lowered quantum yield of water oxidation. (2) Depletion of C-l- in PS-II by pH 10 treatment reversibly inhibited the oxygen-evolving activity to approximate to 15%. The pH 10 treatment depleted the Cl- from a site which is considered to be equivalent to that studied in most earlier work on Cl--depleted PS-II. The S-2 State in pH 10/Cl--depleted PS-II was reversibly modified to a state from which no S-2 multiline EPR signal was generated and which exhibited an intense S-2 g = 4 EPR signal corresponding to at least 40% of the centers but possibly to a much larger fraction of centers. The state responsible for the intense S-2 g = 4 signal generated under these conditions is unlike that observed after removal of Cl- from PS-II at pH 6.3, in that this state was more stable in the dark, showing a half-decay time of approximate to 1.5 h at 0 degrees C, and was unable to undergo further charge accumulation. Nevertheless, a fraction of centers, probably different from those exhibiting the S-2 g = 4 signal, was able to advance to the formal S-3 state, giving rise to a narrow EPR signal around g = 2. Addition of the anions SO42- or F- to pH 10/C-l--depleted PS-II affected the properties of PS-II, resulting in EPR properties of the S-2 State similar to those reported earlier following Cl- depletion treatment of PS-II in the presence of these anions. Surprisingly, after addition of F-, the g = 4 EPR signal showed a damped flash-dependent oscillation. In addition, a narrow signal around g = 2, corresponding to the formal S-3 state, also showed a damped flash-dependent oscillation pattern. The presence of oscillating EPR signals (albeit damped) in F--treated pH 10/Cl--depleted PS-II indicates functional enzyme turnover. This was confirmed by measurements of the oxygen-evolving activity versus light intensity which indicated that in similar to 45% of oxygen-evolving centers the enzyme turnover was slowed by a factor of 2. The distinct Cl- depletion effects in PS-II observed under the two different Cl- depletion treatments are considered to reflect the presence of two distinct Cl--binding sites in PS-II.									73	0	0	0	51	0	73			0006-2960			WOS:A1996TV60000016	8639664

In this work, amorphous Cl-Ta2O5-x microspheres were prepared by facile solvothermal method for stabilized visible light photocatalytic hydrogen generation. The acetone absorbed on the interfaces of Ta2O5 nanoparticles induced the formation of oxygen vacancies, enhanced visible light absorption, and formation of Ta2O5-x microspheres with preferred orientations as well as Cl doping. The Cl-Ta2O5-x microspheres showed typical amorphous characteristics and obvious visible light absorption in comparison to those of commercial Ta2O5. More importantly, the prepared Cl-Ta2O5-x microspheres also showed stabilized visible light photocatalytic hydrogen generation performance in the spectral regions of 400 nm <= lambda <= 600 nm mainly because of the introduction of oxygen vacancy defects and Cl doping, which might significantly expand the application of tantalum oxide semiconductors in the broad spectral photocatalytic water splitting.

GenBank databases (NCBI and JGI) and gene synteny analyses showed the absence of the Mb gene (mb) in two anuran amphibians, Xenopus laevis and X . tropiealis. Here we conducted comparative studies on the gene expression and tissue distribution of Cygb and Mb in anuran and reptilian tissues. Cygb and Mb genes were cloned from a reptile, iguana (Iguana iguana). Two types of cygb (cygb-1 and -2) were cloned, with lengths of 1066 and 1034 bp, and 196 and 193 amino acid residues, respectively. Their nucleotide and amino acid sequence identities were 90 and 87%, respectively. The Mb gene covered 1416 bp with an open reading frame of 465 bp, giving rise to a 154 amino acid protein. The distal ligand-binding histidine at E7, the proximal heme-binding histidine at F8, and the phenylalanine residue at CD1 were conserved in Mb and Cygb. The nucleotide and amino acid sequence identity of I. iguana cygb-1 and cygb-2 against X. laevis cygb were approximately 67% and 65%, respectively. RT-PCR demonstrated that X. laevis cygb was uniquely expressed in the heart and skeletal muscles, and faintly in the liver and spleen, which was quite contrasted with Iguana and the other vertebrates, where mb is exclusively expressed in the heart and skeletal muscles. Immunohistochemical analyses showed the distribution of Cygb in the cytoplasm of skeletal muscle cells. Interestingly, Cygb in the heart was localized in the nuclei. Considering the absence of mb in the Anura, we hypothesize that Cygb in muscle cells of anurans compensates for the lack of Mb for the storage and intracellular transportation of oxygen.

J	Bradley, PA								Asteroseismological constraints on the structure of the ZZ Ceti stars G117-B15A and R548								ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL SUPPLEMENT SERIES				116	2			307	319		10.1086/313102				JUN 1998	1998	This study compares the theoretical pulsation periods from a new grid of evolutionary DA white dwarf models to the observed periods of the ZZ Ceti white dwarfs G117-B15A and R548 (=ZZ Ceti) in order to constrain their internal structure. Assuming that the similar periods of the two stars is the result of their having nearly identical internal structures, then they must have a hydrogen layer mass of similar to 10(-7)M* or greater. If we follow Clemens's work and identify the period near 215 s as the e = 1, k = 2 mode, then the hydrogen layer mass is close to 10(-4)M*, quite close to the maximum hydrogen layer mass allowed by stellar evolution theory. Based on this analysis, G117-B15A and R548 probably have masses near 0.60 M. and M(H) similar to 10(-4)M*, and R548 is about 0.04 M. less massive than G117-B15A. Alternatively, if 215 s is the k = 1 mode, then the hydrogen layer mass decreases to about 10(-7)M*, but the stellar mass remains near 0.60 M.. In all cases, the helium layer mass is near 10(-2)M*, and the C/O core of both stars is oxygen rich. The existence of the 304 s mode of G117-B15A strongly restricts the allowable core structure. At 0.60 Mo, the core is either 50:50 C/O to 0.75M* or 20:80 C/O to 0.83M*. The fine-structure splitting of R548 is due to slow rotation, and we can duplicate the observed splitting trend and periods if the 213 s mode is k = 2, the model mass is near 0.54 M., and the hydrogen layer mass is near 1.5 x 10(-4)M*.									69	1	0	0	0	0	69			0067-0049			WOS:000074274000007

The changing morphology and the local elemental composition in the pellets were followed for increasing time on stream. Molybdenum was shown to volatilize, leaving a depleted zone starting at the pellet surface and moving inwards with time. For temperatures = 300 degrees C only volatilization of the excess MoO3 phase was observed. Increasing concentration of MeOH and temperature enhanced the rate of volatilization, the oxygen concentration had negligible effect, while increasing the H2O concentration decreased the volatilization rate. At 350 degrees C (MeOH = 4.5%, O-2 = 10%, H2O = 0% in N-2) Mo in the Fe-2(MoO4)(3) phase was furthermore volatilized leading to the formation of the reduced ferrous molybdate (FeMoO4). A dynamic 1D mathematical model for a single pellet, in which methanol oxidation to formaldehyde and simultaneous volatilization of free MoO3 takes place, was developed. The model parameters were fitted using experimental data of the pellet weight loss while the evolution of the MoO3 depletion layer thickness was used to validate the model. The model describes the data well and additionally predicts that deposition of MoO3 behind the depletion layer front occurs under certain conditions, leading to a MoO3 deposition layer, which was verified by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) combined with energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS). Simulations with the model show that the overall loss of molybdenum is significantly slower for large pellets compared to small pellets, which is a key parameter for the success of the industrial process.									14	2	0	0	2	0	14			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000457096400126

To quantify the compartmentalised reactions, quantitative measurements of relevant physiological variables in different compartments are needed, especially of cofactors. NADP(H) are critical components in cellular redox metabolism. Currently, available metabolite measurement methods allow whole cell measurements. Here a metabolite sensor based on a fast equilibrium reaction is introduced to monitor the cytosolic NADPH/NADP ratio in Saccharomyces cerevisiae: NADP + shikimate reversible arrow NADPH + H+ + dehydroshikimate. The cytosolic NADPH/NADP ratio was determined by measuring the shikimate and dehydroshikimate concentrations (by GC-MS/MS). The cytosolic NADPH/NADP ratio was determined under batch and chemostat (aerobic, glucose-limited, D = 0.1 h(-1)) conditions, to be 22.0 +/- 2.6 and 15.6 +/- 0.6, respectively. These ratios were much higher than the whole cell NADPH/NADP ratio (1.05 +/- 0.08). In response to a glucose pulse, the cytosolic NADPH/NADP ratio first increased very rapidly and restored the steady state ratio after 3 minutes. In contrast to this dynamic observation, the whole cell NADPH/NADP ratio remained nearly constant. The novel cytosol NADPH/NADP measurements provide new insights into the thermodynamic driving forces for NADP(H)-dependent reactions, like amino acid synthesis, product pathways like fatty acid production or the mevalonate pathway.									32	2	0	0	28	0	34			2045-2322			WOS:000359131600001	26243542

Analyses of electrophoretic patterns and amino-terminal sequences of the proteolytic products revealed that the three proteases specifically cleaved the protein at a site between Ph-156 and Gly(163) or between Arg(184) and Ser(191). Site-directed mutagenesis was used to construct two mutant MSPs that had a nick between Phe(156) and Leu(157), a chymotrypsin-cleavage site, and Met before Leu(157) or in place of Leu(157). The two mutant proteins failed to bind to PSII complexes, although they largely retained ordered secondary structure and comigrated with the wild-type proteins in non-denaturing gel electrophoresis. The loss of the protein binding can be ascribed to introduction of a nick because a mutant protein that had Met in place of Leu(157) but no nick was able to specifically bind to the functional site of PSII complexes and restore the oxygen-evolving activity as effectively as the wild-type protein. In contrast, a mutant MSP with Met inserted between Phe(156) and Leu(157) bound only weakly and non-specifically to PSII complexes and failed to reactivate oxygen evolution. Thus, the binding of the protein to the functional site of the PSII complex was highly sensitive to a small structural change that was caused by cleavage or insertion of a single amino acid residue between Phe(156) and Leu(157). The results suggest that the phe(156)-Gly(163) and Arg(184) Ser(191) sequences of the cyanobacterial MSP are regions for interaction with PSII complexes. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V.

J	Chen, Chen; Li, Kan; Li, Chen; Sun, Tonghua; Jia, Jinping								Combination of Pd-Cu Catalysis and Electrolytic H-2 Evolution for Selective Nitrate Reduction Using Protonated Polypyrrole as a Cathode								ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY				53	23			13868	13877		10.1021/acs.est.9b04447				DEC 3 2019	2019	Pd-Cu catalysis is combined with in situ electrolytic H-2 evolution for NO3- reduction with protonated polypyrrole (PPy) as a cathode. The surface of PPy is not only beneficial for H-2 evolution, but exclusive for NO(3)(- )adsorption, and thus inhibits NO3- reduction. Meanwhile, the in situ H-2 generation exhibits a much higher utilization efficiency because of the smaller bubble size and higher dispersion. The Pd-Cu catalysts with the ratios of 6:1 and 4:1 exhibit the highest NO3- N removal (100%) and N-2 selectivity (93-95%) after 90 min. In comparison with the results obtained with other cathode materials (Ti, Cu, Co3O4, and Fe2O3) and obtained by other researchers, the new process shows a faster NO3--N reduction rate and much higher N-2 selectivity. However, the O-2 generated on the anode can oxidize Cu to Cu2O that may work as the catalyst for NO3- -N reduction to NH4+-N by H-2 , resulting in more than 60% NH4+-N generated without a proton exchange membrane. Both the PPy film and Pd-Cu catalyst exhibit good stability and there is no Cu2+ or Pd2+ in solution after reaction. Real industrial wastewater is further treated in this system, the NO3--N is reduced from 670 mg L(-1 )to less than 100 mg L-1 in 90 min, and only little amount of NH4+-N is generated.									42	1	0	0	19	0	43			0013-936X	1520-5851		WOS:000500838900035	31577132

Imker, Heidi/F-5641-2012	Imker, Heidi/0000-0003-4748-7453			Mechanistic diversity in the RuBisCO superfamily: The "Enolase" in the methionine salvage pathway in Geobacillus kaustophilus								BIOCHEMISTRY				46	13			4077	4089		10.1021/bi7000483				APR 3 2007	2007	D-Ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (RuBisCO), the most abundant enzyme, is the paradigm member of the recently recognized mechanistically diverse RuBisCO superfamily. The RuBisCO reaction is initiated by abstraction of the proton from C3 of the D- ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate substrate by a carbamate oxygen of carboxylated Lys 201 (spinach enzyme). Heterofunctional homologues of RuBisCO found in species of Bacilli catalyze the tautomerization ("enolization") of 2,3-diketo-5-methylthiopentane 1-phosphate (DK-MTP 1-P) in the methionine salvage pathway in which 5-methylthio-D-ribose (MTR) derived from 5'-methylthioadenosine is converted to methionine [Ashida, H., Saito, Y., Kojima, C., Kobayashi, K., Ogasawara, N., and Yokota, A. (2003) A functional link between RuBisCO-like protein of Bacillus and photosynthetic RuBisCO, Science 302, 286-290]. The reaction catalyzed by this "enolase" is accomplished by abstraction of a proton from C1 of the DK-MTP 1-P substrate to form the tautomerized product, a conjugated enol. Because the RuBisCO- and "enolase"-catalyzed reactions differ in the regiochemistry of proton abstraction but are expected to share stabilization of an enolate anion intermediate by coordination to an active site Mg2+, we sought to establish structure-function relationships for the "enolase" reaction so that the structural basis for the functional diversity could be established. We determined the stereochemical course of the reaction catalyzed by the "enolases" from Bacillus subtilis and Geobacillus kaustophilus. Using stereospecifically deuterated samples of an alternate substrate derived from D-ribose (5-OH group instead of the 5-methylthio group in MTR) as well as of the natural DK-MTP 1-P substrate, we determined that the "enolase"-catalyzed reaction involves abstraction of the 1-proS proton. We also determined the structure of the activated "enolase" from G. kaustophilus (carboxylated on Lys 173) liganded with Mg2+ and 2,3-diketohexane 1-phosphate, a stable alternate substrate. The stereospecificity of proton abstraction restricts the location of the general base to the N-terminal alpha+beta domain instead of the C-terminal (beta/alpha)(8)-barrel domain that contains the carboxylated Lys 173. Lys 98 in the N-terminal domain, conserved in all "enolases", is positioned to abstract the 1-proS proton. Consistent with this proposed function, the K98A mutant of the G. kaustophilus "enolase" is unable to catalyze the "enolase" reaction. Thus, we conclude that this functionally divergent member of the RuBisCO superfamily uses the same structural strategy as RuBisCO for stabilizing the enolate anion intermediate, i.e., coordination to an essential Mg2+, but the proton abstraction is catalyzed by a different general base.									47	0	0	0	45	0	50			0006-2960			WOS:000245207800015	17352497

Using first-principles calculations within density-functional theory, a number of TM atoms embedded on a 2D COF Pc-TFPN (TMPc-TFPN) as SACs for ammonia synthesis under ambient conditions are investigated. Through a "five-step" screening strategy, WPc-TFPN is highlighted from 26 TMPc-TFPNs as the best SACs for nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR) with a low limiting potential of -0.19 V. Meanwhile, multiple-level descriptors are developed to uncover the origins of NRR activity, among which a simple descriptor phi that involves the electronegativity and number of d electrons of TM atoms shows volcano plot trends of limiting potential of NRR. This work provides a rational strategy for fast screening SACs for the electrochemical N-2 fixation using 2D COFs containing TM-N-4 units as host materials, which could also be applied to other electrochemical reactions.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000739344900001	34963279

In our previous studies, the SiO desorption yield decreased with increasing incident energy in a temperature region from 900 K to 1000 K. In that case, the time evolutions of Si 2p photoemission spectra showed that SiO2 structure on the surface was easily formed by the action of larger incident energy and the increased SiO2 coverage correlated with the decreased SiO desorption yield. In this study, simultaneous measurements of Si 2p photoemission spectra and SiO desorption yield revealed that the decrease of SiO correlated with the increase of Si2+ component, and the SiO desorption was terminated at the oxide thickness of 0.22 nm. These facts suggest that the SiO desorption takes place at the topmost Si dimcrs and a precursor for SiO desorption is a so-called T site, in which O atoms are bonding with the dangling bonds of the dimers. Consequently, M1 and M2 in the Dual-Oxide-Species (DOS) model have been clarified to be a T site and a Si2+ state, respectively.

We use a parametric model that treats extra mixing by introducing mass flow between the convective envelope and the underlying radiative zone. The parameters of this model are the mass circulation rate ((M))over dot and the maximum temperature (T-P) experienced by the circulating material. The effects of nuclear reactions in the owing matter were calculated using a set of static structures of the radiative zone selected from particular times in a complete stellar evolution calculation. The compositions of the owing material were obtained, and the resulting changes in the envelope determined. No major shifts in the star's energy budget occur from the imposed CBP if log T-P<7.73. Using structures from several times on the TP-AGB, it was found that the results for all species except Al-26 were essentially independent of the time chosen if log T-P>7.6. Abundant Al-26 was produced by CBP for log T-P>7.65. While Al-26/Al-21 depends on T-P, the other isotopic ratios depend dominantly on the circulation rate. The relationship is shown between models of CBP as parameterized by a diffusion formalism within the stellar evolution model and those using the mass-flow formalism employed here. They are shown to be effectively equivalent. In general, the CBP treatment readily permits calculation of envelope compositions as affected by different degrees of extra mixing, based on stellar structures computed by normal stellar evolution models. Using these results, the isotopic ratios under conditions of C/O<1 and C/O>1 are compared with the data on circumstellar dust grains. It is found that the O-18/O-16, O-17/O-16, and Al-26/Al-27 observed for oxide grains formed at C/O<1 are reasonably well understood. However, the N-15/N-14, C-12/C-13, and Al-26/Al-27 in carbide grains (C/O>1) require that many of their stellar sources must have had N-14/N-15 at least a factor of 4 lower than the solar value. This allows a self-consistent description of all these isotopes in most SiC grains. The rare grains with C-12/C-13<10 cannot be produced by any red giant or AGB source, nor are they reconcilable with novae sources.									233	4	0	0	2	0	235			0004-637X			WOS:000180282700040

Due to its special properties, RuO2 has been applied to supercapacitors, phenolic wastewater, textile industry wastewater, and degrading organic substances. However, there is few reports on the application of the RuO2 catalyst to hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR). In this study, we successfully obtained RuO2 NPs using a simple and eco-friendly hydrothermal method. Furthermore, the electrochemical activity of RuO2 NPs prepared at different concentration (0.15 M, 0.20 M) and different hydrothermal temperature (150 degrees C, 160 degrees C, and 170 degrees C) was evaluated by the hydrogen oxidation reaction. The particle size, composition, dispersion and morphology of the obtained RuO2 catalysts were investigated by X-ray diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). In addition, cyclic voltammograms (CV) were utilized to investigate the electrochemical activity of the RuO2 catalysts. The results showed that the obtained catalyst at a hydrothermal temperature of 160 degrees C and a concentration of 0.15 M displayed a Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface area of 26.74 m(2) g(-1). Meanwhile, the catalyst had a uniform distribution. The hydrogen oxidation current density of the obtained RuO2 catalysts is upto 6 mA cm(-2), showing a good electrochemical activity for hydrogen oxidation reaction.

A Parametric Study and History Matching Aspects								INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL REACTOR ENGINEERING				15	6	SI				20170119	10.1515/ijcre-2017-0119				DEC 2017	2017	The in-situ combustion method is an enhanced oil recovery technique based on the injection of air in petroleum reservoirs with the aim to burn a portion of hydrocarbons. This reduces the oil viscosity improving substantially the oil mobility. Simultaneously other phenomena take place as: distillation, segregation, oil upgrading, among others. In this work, a mathematical model to simulate oil combustion for kinetic cell experiments is presented. The model includes four-phases, nine components and four chemical reactions: coke formation, heavy oil fraction combustion, light oil fraction combustion and coke combustion. This formulation is commonly used to simulate in-situ combustion projects at combustion tubes-and petroleum reservoir-scales. The mass and energy balances were formulated leading to one set of highly coupled ordinary differential equations, which was numerically solved. The predictive model capabilities were tested by comparison with lab data, and it was found that CO and CO2 productions, oxygen uptake and cell temperature evolution agree well with experimental results. At one preliminary stage, the parameters fitting experimental results were inferred by individual manipulation until the best results were found. These parameters were perturbed in order to identify those parameters dominating the global dynamic of process. We found that energy activations and the mass density of oil components are the dominant parameters. We suggest that history matching processes must be focused over these parameters, and for this end, the implementation of advanced computational routines to solve multivariable inverse problems is recommended. In this work, we developed two automatic history matching techniques: one process based on Newton's method and the second one based on evolutionary algorithms. The Newton's method showed problems to find the minimum error, meanwhile the evolutionary algorithm was able to optimize the dominant parameters, but at the expense of slow convergence.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2194-5748	1542-6580		WOS:000418185500015		
J	Shang Xiuling; Zhang Bo; Ke Wei				Zhang, Bo/AAC-2788-2022				Effect of Sb-Rich Intermetallic Phase on the Corrosion Resistance of Zn Alloy in Near-Neutral and Acidic Solutions								ACTA METALLURGICA SINICA				53	3			351	357		10.11900/0412.1961.2016.00419				MAR 11 2017	2017	In the process of hot-dip galvanizing, some beneficial alloying elements are deliberately added to the molten Zn bath, in order to improve the coating properties, such as formability and corrosion resistance. Sb is one of the interesting alloying additions to the Zn bath, as it can decrease the viscosity and the surface tension of the molten Zn, contributing to producing a uniform Zn coating. Due to the low solid solubility of Sb in molten Zn at galvanising temperature, Sb-rich intermetallic particles were always found in the galvanized layers. The presence of Sb-rich phases may affect the structural properties and corrosion performance of galvanized coating. In the literature, it was reported that small addition of Sb has no significant effect on the structure and growth of galvanized layers, but a higher amount (>1%, mass fraction) of Sb can promote the dendritic solidification of Zn. In order to understand the mechanism of Sb addition on the structure and growth of galvanized coating, it is essential to identify the crystal structure of Sb-rich phases. It was reported that the Sb-rich phases found in the eta layer of a galvanized coating corresponds to the electron diffraction patterns of Sb2Zn3. However, some researchers hold that the Sb2Zn3 compound does not exist at room temperature, since it can transform to Sb3Zn4 and Zn at some elevated temperature. Consequently, in this work, the structure of Sb-rich intermetallic phase in theZn-1.2Sb (1.2%Sb) alloy has been investigated by SEM and TEM. SEM/EDS showed that Sb is present in the form of Sb-rich intermatallic phase and there is no detectable Sb in the Zn solid solution. Transmission electron diffractions analysis and EDS results indicated that the composition of Sb-rich intermatallic phases is close to that of Sb2Zn3, whereas the structure is totally different from the latter. The corrosion resistance of Zn-1.2Sb alloy has been analysed by electrochemcial polarization measurements in the different solutions. The analysed results showed that the Sb-rich phase has no obvious effect on the oxygen reduction reaction, in the aerated 0.1 mol/L NaCl (pH=6.5) solution. However, the Sb-rich phase can promote the hydrogen evolution reaction, in the deaerated acidic solution (0.1 mol/L NaCl, pH=3). Corrosion pits were found in the Zn matrix around the Sb-rich phases by SEM observations, which indicate that Zn has higher activity than Zn-Sb phase.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0412-1961			WOS:000398631400008

Herein, we report novel 3D Ni3S2/Cu-NiCo LDH heterostructure nanosheet arrays grown on nickel foam as a promising bifunctional electrocatalyst for the OER and HER. In this design, copper ions are firstly doped into NiCo LDH to tune the electronic structure and enhance the inherent activity of pristine LDH. Metallic Ni3S2 is then introduced to establish a coupling heterostructure interface with Cu-NiCo LDH to boost the conductivity and activity. The incorporation of Cu ions and Ni3S2 into NiCo LDH also creates more active sites through crystal structure disorder and interface defects. Moreover, the 3D hierarchical nanosheet arrays can accelerate the electrolyte diffusion, promote the rapid release of gas bubbles, and ensure fast electron/mass transport along with strong electrochemical stability. All these merits endow the materials with a superior overall water splitting ability in an alkaline environment, showing low overpotentials of 119 and 218 mV for the OER and overpotentials of 156 and 304 mV for the HER at 10 and 100 mA cm(-2), respectively. Furthermore, the overall water electrolytic cell using Ni3S2/Cu-NiCo LDH as both electrodes can reach 100 mA cm(-2) at 1.75 V with outstanding durability. This study provides a new strategy and insights for the exploration of high activity non-noble metal catalysts for overall water splitting.									11	0	0	0	0	0	11			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000725670100001

Black glasses are materials of amorphous silica structure where some amount of O-2-ions were replaced by C-4-ions. This exchange leads to local increase in bonds density and therefore improvement in mechanical, thermal, and chemical properties. Thanks to this modification, silicon oxycarbide glasses can be used in a variety of applications like: protective coatings and interconnectors in solid oxide fuel cells. Xerogels were prepared by sol-gel method, and ladder-like silsesquioxanes were used as precursors. Samples were burned at 200-1000 degrees C in inert atmosphere. Structural studies in the middle infrared range (MIR) and SEM with EDX confirmed the presence of SiOC bonds in obtained materials. MIR analysis of solid samples together with TG/dTG measurements allowed defining the process for the formation of black glasses.									17	0	0	0	0	0	17			1388-6150	1588-2926		WOS:000411160300012

However, the H-2-production activity of the bulk MoSe2 is still unsatisfactory because its interfacial H-2-generation rate is dominantly hindered by its insufficient and low-efficiency Se sites. Herein, Se-rich amorphous MoSex nanodots (a-MoSex) as a novel H-2-evolution cocatalyst are fabricated onto TiO2 via a lactic acid-induced hydrolysis pathway. The as-synthesized a-MoSex cocatalyst displays an ultrasmall and amorphous structure, especially Se-rich property, which distinctly maximizes the number of active Se sites and optimizes H-2-production efficiency of Se atoms. Ultimately, the optimized a-MoSex/TiO2(1 mL) photocatalyst delivers a superior H-2-evolution rate of 86.28 mu mol h(-1), which is about 76.4- and 2.5-fold of the pure TiO2 and the crystalline MoSe2 modified-TiO2 samples, respectively. Combined with the experimental investigations and density functional theory (DFT) calculations, the Se-rich amorphous MoSex nanodots can not only effectively promote the photoexcited charge separation, but also achieve the simultaneous optimization of the number and H-2-evolution efficiency of active Se sites, thus actually improving photocatalytic H-2-production activity of TiO2. This work offers a new paradigm to simultaneously optimizing the number and efficiency of active Se sites for interfacial H-2 evolution, which delivers an inspiration on constructing highly efficient cocatalysts for solar-energy conversion.									4	0	0	0	1	0	4			2367-198X			WOS:000719670000001

The synthesized catalysts were characterized by analytical tools such as XRD, SEM, BET, EDS, XPS, FTIR, UV-Vis DRS, PL, CV and EIS. The XRD analysis points towards substitution of Ca into ZnO as revealed by shift of plane towards smaller 20 value, and reduced crystal size. UV-Vis DRS and EIS analysis evidence that Ca doped ZnO catalysts demonstrate enhanced optical absorption and reduced impedance. XPS study evidenced the substitution of Zn+2 by Ca+2 and enhanced Zn-O bond strengths in CZO catalyst. Textural properties of CZO nanoparticles were superior to that of pristine ZnO. Among series of prepared CZO nanoparticles, the 3 mol% Ca doped ZnO (CZO4) was found to be most efficient candidate for hydrogen evolution under visible light illumination, whose hydrogen evolution rate (819.75 mu molh(-1)) is twice than that of previously reported optimal ZnO photocatalysts. Small particle size, enhanced optical absorption, reduced interfacial resistance, narrow band gap and high surface area were recognized as responsible factors towards increased photocatalytic hydrogen evolution activities of Ca doped ZnO nanoparticles.									32	1	0	0	2	0	32			1369-8001	1873-4081		WOS:000493393800053

Here we report an exploration on the effects upon ongoing reactions of daylight equivalent light intensity illumination with regulated short dark periods of a few seconds duration as compared to standard continuous illumination. Comparison was made with systems employing synthesized low cost earth abundant iron oxide, calciumoxomanganite and cobalt oxide nanoparticulate catalysts together with a [Ru(bpy)(3)](2+) light harvesting dye and an electron acceptor. Yields of gaseous O-2 and proton production were measured in situ and in real time. The study found that low cost catalysts could give very significantly increased O-2 yields, turn over frequency and improved reaction profiles by use of simple on/off illumination. A range of timings with identical overall photon flux were tested and an optimum determined. Analysis of effects upon the light sensitizer under the range of lighting conditions (through mass spectrometry and UV-vis measurements), together with implementation of a continuous flow system as comparison to the batch reactions, were all employed to help elucidate the mechanisms for the clear improvements in reaction yields observed. These are believed to stem from reduction in self-decomposition of excess oxidized sensitizer and better synchronization of cyclic sensitizer oxidation/reductions with water oxidation at the metal oxide surface at specific light on : off timing.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			2398-4902			WOS:000422798800008

They are associated with diverse bioavailable geochemical fractions, like the water-soluble fraction and the exchangeable fraction, and non-available fractions like those associated with the crystalline net of clays and silica minerals. Depending upon their chemical and physical properties we can distinguish different mechanisms of metal toxicity in plants, such as production of reactive oxygen species from auto-oxidation, blocking and/or displacement of essential functional groups or metallic ions of biomolecules, changes in the permeability of cellular membranes, reactions of sulphydryl groups with cations, affinity for reactions with phosphate groups and active groups of ADP or ATP, substitution of essential ions, induction of chromosomal anomalies and decrease of the cellular division rate. However, some plant species have developed tolerance or resistance to these metals naturally. Such evolution of ecotypes is a classic example of local adaptation and microevolution, restricted to species with appropriate genetic variability. Phytoremediator woody species, with (i) high biomass production, (ii) a deep root system, (iii) high growth rate, (iv) high capacity to grow in impoverished soils, and (v) high capacity to allocate metals in the trunk, can be an alternative for the recovery of degraded soils due to excess of metallic elements. Phytoremediation using woody species presents advantageous characteristics as an economic and ecologically viable system, making it an appropriate, practical and successful technology.		Altas concentrações de Cd, Pb, Cu e Cr podem provocar efeitos danosos ao ambiente. Esses poluentes altamente tóxicos constituem um risco para a vida aquática e terrestre. Encontram-se associados às diversas frações geoquímicas biodisponíveis, a exemplo da fração solúvel em água e da fração trocável, e as não disponíveis como a fração associada à rede cristalina de argilas e de minerais silicatados. Conforme as suas propriedades químicas e físicas podem-se distinguir mecanismos diferentes de toxicidade de metais em plantas, tais como produção de espécies reativas de oxigênio pela auto-oxidação, bloqueio e, ou, deslocamento de grupos funcionais ou de íons metálicos essenciais de biomoléculas, mudanças na permeabilidade de membranas celulares, reações de grupos sulfidrílicos com cátions, afinidade para reações com grupos fosfatos e grupos ativos de ADP ou ATP, substituição de íons essenciais, indução de anomalias cromossomais e decréscimo da taxa de divisão celular. Várias espécies vegetais desenvolveram, naturalmente, tolerância ou resistência a esses metais. Essa evolução de ecótipos é exemplo clássico de adaptação local e de microevolução, restrita às espécies com variabilidade genética apropriada. Espécies lenhosas fitorremediadoras, com (i) elevada produção de biomassa, (ii) sistema radicular profundo, (iii) altas taxas de crescimento, (iv) capacidade de crescer em solos pobres em nutrientes e (v) alta capacidade de concentrar metais no tronco podem ser alternativas importantes para a descontaminação de solos com excesso de elementos metálicos. A fitorremediação apresenta características vantajosas, como sistema econômico e ecologicamente viável, que a torna uma tecnologia apropriada, prática e bem sucedida como opção para remediação.							71	1	0	0	62	5	76			1677-0420			SCIELO:S1677-04202007000200001

Herein we disclose the ability of amino acids to catalyze the asymmetric neogenesis of carbohydrates by sequential cross-aldol reactions. The amino acids mediate the asymmetric de novo synthesis of natural L- and D-hexoses and their analogues with excellent stereoselectivity in organic solvents. In some cases, the four new stereocenters are assembled with almost absolute stereo-control. The unique feature of these results is that, when an amino acid is employed as the catalyst, a single reaction sequence can convert a protected glycol aldehyde into a hexose in one step. For example, proline and its derivatives catalyze the asymmetric neo-genesis of allose with < 99% ee in one chemical manipulation. Furthermore. all amino acids tested catalyzed the asymmetric formation of natural sugars under prebiotic conditions with alanine being the smallest catalyst. The inherent simplicity of this catalytic process suggests that a catalytic prebiotic 'gluconeogenesis" may occur in which amino acids transfer their stereochemical information to sugars. In addition. the amino acid catalyzed stercoselective sequential cross-aldol reactions were performed as a two-step procedure with different aldehydes as acceptors acceptors and nucleophiles. The employment of two different amino acids as catalysts for the iterative direct aldol reaction enabled the asymmetric synthesis of deoxysugars with > 99% ee. In addition. the direct amino acid catalyzed C-2+C-2+C-2 methodology is a new entry for the short, highly enantioselective de novo synthesis of carbohydrate derivatives. isotope-labeled sugars, and polykelide natural products, The one-pot asymmetric de novo syntheses of deoxy and polyketide carbohydrates involved a novel dynamic kinetic asymmetric transformation (DYKAT) mediated by an amino acid.									124	0	0	0	20	0	125			0947-6539	1521-3765		WOS:000231324200021	15929141

A series of Ni-xFe/mayenite (Ca12Al14O33) catalysts were prepared by co-impregnation method, and were tested for dry reforming of methane at 700 degrees C, atmospheric pressure and a feeding CH4/CO2 ratio of 1. Effects of metal load, support contents, particle size on DRM activity and stability of Ni-xFe/mayenite were systematically investigated. Evolution of the catalyst micro-structures before and after DRM has been examined by XRD, BET, TEM-EDX and XPS. The 7.5%Ni-0.1Fe/Ca12Al14O33 catalyst achieved a high conversion (90.1% for CO2 and 86% for CH4) approximate to thermodynamic equilibrium, along with a H-2/CO ration of 0.94, and could be operated stably for 60 h. With mayenite as support, the activity of Ni-xFe/Ca12Al14O33 catalysts improved greatly as Ni content increased from 5 wt% to 10 wt%, whereas limited promotion of activity was observed when metal load further increased to 20 wt%. Ni/Ca12Al14O33 with high metal load was more prone to carbon disposition, which caused the reactor to be plugged, but 2 wt% doping of Fe then efficiently suppressed coking during DRM. Mayenite as support was supposed to enhance the oxygen species transfer from FeOx to Ni sites and nickel-support interface, so promoted oxidation of carbon species. Resultantly, with the synergistic assistance of mayenite support and Fe promotion, high CH4-CO2 conversion and excellent stability was possible for Ni-xFe/Ca12Al14O33 catalysts.									17	0	0	0	0	0	17			0016-2361	1873-7153		WOS:000586954400082

The manganese(II) compound [Mn(H2O)(6)][B10H10] center dot 2 H2O could be obtained by the reaction of an aqueous solution of Ba[B10H10] with Mn(SO4) center dot H2O after the precipitation of Ba(SO4). For the zinc salt [Zn(H2O)(6)][B10H10] center dot 2 H2O an aqueous solution of (H3O)(2)[B10H10] was reacted with the basic zinc(II) carbonate [Zn(CO3)](2) center dot [Zn(OH)(2)](3). All five compounds crystallize isotypically in the monoclinic space group C2/c with four formula units per unit cell. Their crystal structure contains crystallographically unique transition metal(II) cations, which are octahedrally coordinated by oxygen atoms of six water molecules. Another six water molecules are bound to each hexaaqua-transition-metal(II) cation through hydrogen bonds, again erecting a distorted octahedron. The second octahedra are linked to each others via common edges to build up a layer containing [M(H2O)(6)](2+) cations and second-sphere crystal water molecules. Between these layers the bicapped square-antiprismatically shaped decahydro-closo-decaborate anions [B10H10](2-) are situated and held there through non-classical hydrogen bonds between the positively polarized hydrogen atoms of water molecules and the negatively polarized hydrogen atoms of boron-cluster anions. The closo-decaborate clusters themselves show only slight distortions away from their ideal D-4d symmetry as vibrational spectroscopy studies prove. Stepwise thermal decomposition takes place not only under water removement, but finally also under hydrogen evolution.									12	0	1	0	0	0	12			2194-4946	2196-7105		WOS:000327754100010

However, in absorbers such as BiVO4, TiO2, alpha-Fe2O3, and WO3, charge carriers localize as small polarons or become trapped, leading to low minority carrier mobilities. This limits the minority carrier collection efficiency in the quasi-neutral region of the light absorber, and lowers the overall photoactivity. In this work, we demonstrate that modestly elevating the temperature activates minority carrier hopping in monoclinic BiVO4, significantly enhancing the saturation photocurrent without a substantial anodic shift of the onset potential, and is an attractive alternative to employing complex passivation layers and nanostructured templates towards achieving the theoretical photocurrent density. Specifically, using a Mo:BiVO4/SnO2/Si tandem photoanode/photovoltaic, increasing the absolute temperature by 11% from 10 to 42 degrees C elevates the saturation photocurrent from 1.8 to 4.0 mA cm(-2). This strong temperature enhancement, 3.8% K-1, is 5 times greater than that in alpha-Fe2O3. Concurrently, the onset potential shifts slightly from 0.02 V to 0.08 V versus the reversible hydrogen electrode (or equivalently, from -1.22 V to -1.13 V versus the equilibrium potential of oxygen evolution). Our observation contrasts with the prevailing understanding that the energy conversion efficiency generally decreases with temperature as a result of reduced photovoltage. Thermally-activating minority carrier transport represents a general pathway towards enhancing the photoactivity of light absorbers where hopping conduction limits the minority carrier collection in the quasi-neutral region.									84	5	0	0	2	0	84			1754-5692	1754-5706		WOS:000378244200013

Biomass accumulation (fresh and dry weights), photosynthetic pigments, photosynthetic oxygen evolution and S content were declined by Cr(VI) toxicity. Furthermore, fluorescence characteristics (JIP-test) were also affected by Cr(VI), but Cr(VI) toxicity on photosystem II photochemistry was ameliorated by HS treatment via reducing damaging effect on PS II reaction centre and its reduction side. Enhanced respiration, Cr content and oxidative biomarkers: superoxide radical, hydrogen peroxide, lipid peroxidation and membrane damage were observed under Cr(VI) stress. Though Cr(VI) enhanced adenosine triphasphate sulfurylase (ATPS) and o-acetylserine(thiol)lyase (OASTL), glutathione-S-transferase (GST), glutathione reductase (GR) and ascorbate peroxidase (APX) activity, and content of total glutathione, cysteine and NP-SH, however, their levels/activity were further enhanced by S being maximum with HS treatment. The results show that Cr(VI) toxicity does increase under LS treatment while HS protected Cr(VI)-induced damaging effects in brinjal seedlings. Under HS treatment, in mitigating Cr(VI) toxicity, S assimilation and its associated metabolites such as cysteine, glutathione and NP-SH play crucial role. (C) 2016 Elsevier Masson SAS.

J	Mowlavi, N								Sodium production in asymptotic giant branch stars								ASTRONOMY & ASTROPHYSICS				350	1			73	88						OCT 1999	1999	A new scenario is presented for the production of Na-23 in asymptotic giant branch (AGE) stars. The scenario takes advantage of the periodic third dredge-up episodes characterizing those stars, which mix primary C-12 from their intershell layers to their surface. Two successive interpulse/pulse/dredge-up sequences are then required to produce Na-23. During the first sequence carbon and oxygen are converted into N-14 by the hydrogen burning shell, and subsequently transformed into Ne-22 by the helium burning shell. During the second sequence, Ne-22 is converted into Na-23 by the hydrogen burning shell, which is brought to the surface by the subsequent dredge-up episode. The Na-23 produced by this scenario is thus primary.The efficiency of this scenario is analyzed through standard evolutionary AGE model predictions combined with synthetic calculations for the surface chemical evolution. It is shown that primary Na-23 can efficiently be produced as soon as the surface C+N+O abundance enhancement reaches a certain level depending on the stellar metallicity. The required surface C+N+O abundance enhancement amounts to similar to 0.4 dex in solar metallicity stars, and to similar to 0.8 dex at a metallicity five times less than solar.An analytical study of Na production further reveals that the surface Na-23 abundance asymptotically evolves to a 'line of primary sodium enrichment' (LOPSE) in the [C+N+C] - [Na-23] diagram. That LOPSE represents the Na-23 abundance evolution predicted in zero metallicity AGE stars experiencing third dredge-up episodes. An analytical relation for the surface Na-23 abundance evolution as a function of the surface C+N+O abundance is provided.The predicted surface Na-23 enhancements can exceed 0.5 dex depending on the level of surface C-12 enrichment, and increases with decreasing stellar metallicity. The quantitative prediction of Na-23 surface abundances, however, is presently subject to a high level of uncertainty, partly due to the still poor quantitative prediction of the structural evolution of AGE stars (dredge-up episodes in particular), and partly due to the uncertainties still affecting some nuclear reaction rates (such as Na-23 destruction by proton capture).The case of massive AGE stars in which hot bottom burning occurs is also discussed. The production of secondary sodium in those stars is a natural consequence of Ne-22 burning in their envelope, if the temperature at the base of the envelope exceeds 70 million K. It requires, however, many interpulses to be significant. The production of primary sodium from the dredge-up of primary Ne-22 and its subsequent burning in the envelope, on the other hand, is estimated not to be very efficient, expect maybe in low-metallicity stars.An eventual detection of high Na overabundances in carbon stars or related objects would support the scenario of primary sodium production in AGE stars. Such an observational evidence may have been found in at least one post-AGE star. Further observations of those objects are called for. Observations of Na-23 in planetary nebulae are also encouraged. Finally, the production of primary Na-23 by AGE stars, if confirmed observationally, may have played a non-negligible role in the chemical evolution of our Galaxy.									59	0	0	0	0	0	59			0004-6361			WOS:000083288000014

The combined effect of low CO2 and high O-2 levels in the modern atmosphere, and the inability of Rubisco to distinguish completely between CO2 and O-2, leads to the occurrence of an oxygenation reaction that reduces the efficiency of photosynthesis. Among land plants, C-4 photosynthesis largely solves this problem by facilitating a high CO2/O-2 ratio at the site of Rubisco that resembles the atmosphere in which the ancestral enzyme evolved. The prediction that such conditions favor Rubiscos with higher kcat(CO2) and lower CO2/O-2 specificity (S-C/O) is well supported, but the structural basis for the differences between C-3 and C-4 Rubiscos is not clear. Flaveria (Asteraceae) includes C-3, C-3-C-4 intermediate, and C-4 species with kinetically distinct Rubiscos, providing a powerful system in which to study the biochemical transition of Rubisco during the evolution from C-3 to C-4 photosynthesis. We analyzed the molecular evolution of chloroplast rbcL and nuclear rbcS genes encoding the large subunit (LSu) and small subunit (SSu) of Rubisco from 15 Flaveria species. We demonstrate positive selection on both subunits, although selection is much stronger on the LSu. In Flaveria, two positively selected LSu amino acid substitutions, M309I and D149A, distinguish C-4 Rubiscos from the ancestral C-3 species and statistically account for much of the kinetic difference between the two groups. However, although Flaveria lacks a characteristic "C-4" SSu, our data suggest that specific residue substitutions in the SSu are correlated with the kinetic properties of Rubisco in this genus.									76	2	0	0	71	0	78			0737-4038	1537-1719		WOS:000288556200015	21172830

The method is free of toxic, pyrophoric alkylphosphine as the phosphorus source, does not involve the use of sophisticated instrumentation or expensive precursors and may be extended to other transition-metal phosphides. When the as prepared Co2P/CNTs are applied as an anode for OER in 1 M KOH, a current density of 10 mA/cm(2) is achieved at an overpotential of 292 mV which is 36 mV less than that required for the state-of-art OER catalyst RuO2 with a small Tafel slope of 68 mV/decade. While applied as a cathode towards HER, Co2P/CNTs exhibit a current density of 10 mA/cm(2) at an overpotential of 132 mV with a Tafel slope of 103 mV/dec that compares favourably with the state-of-the art HER catalyst, Pt/C. After 15 h of continuous electrolysis for both HER and OER, the electrode material preserves its structure along with its robust catalytic activity which points out to their excellent stability. A total alkaline water electrolyzer constructed by employing Co2P/CNT as catalyst on both anode and cathode delivered a current density of 10 inA/cm(2) at around 1.53 V over an extended operational period rivalling the state-of-art combination of Pt/C and RuO2 and is among the best of the bi-functional total-water splitting electrocatalysts reported till date. This remarkable performance of Co2P/CNTs can be attributed to the intrinsic catalytic activity of Co2P nanoparticles fortified with heteroatom doped few layered graphene which results in enhanced electrical conductivity besides providing long-term stability.									163	11	0	0	7	0	164			2211-2855	2211-3282		WOS:000390636100037

Structural transitions and generating metal deficiency are the effective ways of manipulating the d-band centre of a metal surface which enhances the catalytic activity of metal nanoparticles towards the HER. Charge-transfer from in situ generated oxide species to the metal centre also leads to an enhancement in catalytic activity towards the HER. In the present work, we report a facile colloidal synthesis of PdBi2 nanoparticles using sodium borohydride as the reducing agent. Upon annealing the as-synthesized nanoparticles, a phase transition from the lower symmetry monoclinic phase to the higher symmetry tetragonal phase has been observed, and hence a change in morphology from agglomerated to core-shell nanoparticles. Potential electrochemical cycling of both monoclinic and tetragonal PdBi2 leads to the formation of a Pd-rich PdBi2-x alloy with enhanced catalytic activity (onset potential: -11 mV and -18 mV vs. the RHE; 20 mA cm(-2) current density at an overpotential of similar to 140 mV and similar to 207 mV for monoclinic and tetragonal phases, respectively). The low co-ordination number of Pd active sites formed by the dissolution of Bi alters the d-band centre of Pd, and hence the optimal energy required for hydrogen adsorption leading to enhanced activity. Although the obtained composition after potential cycling is almost similar for both phases it is seen that the dealloyed monoclinic phase shows higher activity as compared to the dealloyed tetragonal one. Cyclic voltammetry of the monoclinic PdBi2 shows the formation of Bi-O species after potential cycling. Electron transfer from the Bi-O species to the Pd centre enhances the charge-transfer kinetics of the HER on the catalyst surface and hence an increased catalytic activity of the monoclinic phase as compared to the tetragonal one. Thus, in situ generated oxide species facilitate charge-transfer from oxide to the metal surface which in turn enhances catalytic activity towards the HER.									37	1	0	0	0	0	37			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000406672400053

The electro-catalytic experimental results show that Co3O4@NMC (1:3) can be regarded as the low-cost alternative ORR/OER bi-functional catalyst compared with commercial noble Pt/C + IrO2 catalysts. The potential difference (Delta E) between between E-1/2 and E-j10 for Co3O4@NMC (1:3) sample is only 21 mV larger. Moreover, we observed no obvious degeneration in both ORR and OER activity during ADT tests.

However, the process optimization and pyrolysis efficiency are restricted by the limited perception of the complicated mechanisms and kinetics for biomass pyrolysis. Here, to establish an in-depth mechanism model for biomass pyrolysis, we presented a novel investigation for the thermal evolutions and pyrolysis kinetics of the functional groups in peanut shell matrix by using in-situ Fourier transform infrared spectrometry (in-situ FTIR) and thermogravimetric analysis-Fourier transform infrared spectrometry-mass spectrometry (TG-FTIR-MS). The in-situ FTIR spectrum deconvolution for the solid matrix was innovatively introduced to identify and quantify the real-time evolution and thermal dynamics of the functional groups during peanut shell pyrolysis. The result for the first time proposed that the pyrolysis mechanisms of total OH at 20-380 degrees C, aliphatic C-H-n groups at 20-500 degrees C, C=O groups at 260-500 degrees C, and C-O groups at 300-500 degrees C were dominant by diffusion and order-based chemical reactions. The TG-FTIR-MS analysis was conducted for the online monitoring of the released volatiles and gases, the amounts of which were in the sequence of C=O > CO2 > aliphatic C-O-(H) > C-O-(C) in esters > aromatics > H2O > phenolic hydroxyl > aliphatic hydrocarbons > CO. The study established a novel methodology to evaluate the biomass pyrolysis mechanisms at the molecular level, which provided valuable information for developing advanced pyrolysis techniques on a large scale for sustainable ecosystem.									6	0	0	0	1	0	6			1364-0321	1879-0690		WOS:000714452600003

Unravelling detailed histories and timescales of cementation and replacement is, however, often compromised by the limited spatial resolution of many analytical techniques; in some cases multiple grains are co-analyzed so that diagenetic histories are blurred and reaction periods are difficult to establish. In this study we have used 10-micrometer-resolution, in situ secondary ion mass spectrometry to determine the oxygen isotope composition of 197 individual, 10-50-micrometer-size crystals of dolomite and calcite from six samples in a single core of Upper Devonian middle Bakken Member siltstones and sandstones, the major tight oil formation of the Williston basin, USA. This amount of data places important constraints on the range of temperatures and times that carbonate cementation and replacement occurred. Petrographic data show that microcrystalline calcite cement is an early phase, and combined with mineralogical data suggest that much of the dolomite replaces calcite. Over spatial scales of less than a centimeter, analyses of individual calcite crystals have a range of 5% for delta O-18 in the group of crystals, and for the group of individual dolomite crystals, 10%. These sub-centimeter ranges are as great as those observed in previous studies of carbonate cements sampled over many meters and remind us that previous low-resolution studies may have inadvertently analyzed mixed phases. There is no relationship between dolomite texture and isotopic composition at this spatial scale; microscale backscattered electron imagery and scanning electron microscopy cathodoluminescence zoning is seen, but cannot be resolved with a 10-micrometer spot size. Assuming, since it is an early cement, that calcite precipitated from seawater (delta O-18 = -1.5%), it formed at ca. 15-40 degrees C, mainly at the lower temperatures. Present-day formation waters in Devonian rocks in this region have oxygen isotope compositions of 7-8% VSMOW. Using these values as a likely dolomitizing fluid, we suggest that dolomitization occurred continuously between 40 and 140 degrees C over 150-200 million years, most likely in a fluid with a high Mg/Ca ratio resulting from gypsum formation in local evaporites. We suggest that this exceptionally low rate of dolomitization was controlled by the low rate of supply of Mg in a very sluggish flow regime; dolomitization is incomplete because of a limited supply of Mg.									7	0	0	0	1	0	7			1527-1404	1938-3681		WOS:000429016700006

In one model, these events are thought to result from subsonic burning in the core of an accreting carbon/oxygen white dwarf that is accelerated through flame wrinkling and flame instabilities. Many such white dwarfs have significant magnetic fields. Here we derive the linear effects of such magnetic fields on one flame instability, the well-known Landau-Darrieus instability. When the magnetic field is strong enough that the flame is everywhere sub-Alfvenic, the instability can be greatly suppressed. Super-Alfvenic flames are much less affected by the field, with flames propagating parallel to the field somewhat destabilized and flames propagating perpendicular to the field somewhat stabilized. Trans-Alfvenic parallel flames, however, like trans-Alfvenic parallel shocks, are seen to be nonevolutionary; understanding the behavior of these flames will require careful numerical simulation.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			0004-637X	1538-4357		WOS:000221261900036		
J	Betts, SD; Ross, JR; Pichersky, E; Yocum, CF								Cold-sensitive assembly of a mutant manganese-stabilizing protein caused by a Val to Ala replacement								BIOCHEMISTRY				35	20			6302	6307		10.1021/bi953066t				MAY 21 1996	1996	Photosystem II (PSII) is a multisubunit transmembrane protein complex that oxidizes water and evolves O-2. A tetranuclear manganese cluster associated with integral membrane subunits of PSII catalyzes water oxidation. The 33-kDa water-soluble PSII subunit, or manganese-stabilizing protein (MSP), stabilizes the O-2-evolving manganese cluster and accelerates O-2 evolution. Spinach PSII can be depleted of native MSP under conditions which retain a functional manganese cluster. Reconstition of MSP-depleted PSII with recombinant MSP was equally efficient at 4 and 22 degrees C. Replacement of Val235 (a conserved residue near the C-terminus of MSP) with Ala inhibited assembly of MSP at 4 degrees C, but not at 22 degrees C. Once assembled, [V235A]MSP remained bound to PSII even at 4 degrees C and in the presence of low concentrations of urea. Results from far-UV circular dichroism spectrometry indicated that [V235A]-MSP was destabilized by low temperature to a greater extent than the wild-type protein. However, the effect of temperature on the secondary structure of both the mutant and wild-type proteins was small compared to the temperature-independent destabilization of secondary structure induced by the mutation. These results demonstrate that the V235A mutation introduces an activation energy barrier for assembly of MSP into PSII, and it is suggested that the mutation acts by inhibiting isomerization of one or more prolyl peptide bonds required for assembly.									30	0	0	0	25	0	30			0006-2960			WOS:A1996UM51200017	8639573

For these samples, it was found that the EPR signal from the Y-z(.) radical decays faster at low pH than at high pH. At 20 degreesC, Y-Z(.) decays with biphasic kinetics. At pH 6.5. the fast phase encompasses about 65% of the amplitude and has a lifetime of similar to0.8 s, while the slow phase has a lifetime of similar to22 s. At pH 3.9, the kinetics become totally dominated by the fast phase, with more than 90% of the signal intensity operating with a lifetime of similar to0.3 s. The kinetic changes occurred with an approximate pK(a) of 4.5. Low pH also affected the induction of the so-called split radical EPR signal from the S2YZ. state that is induced in Ca2+-depleted PSII membranes because of an inability of Y-Z(.) to oxidize the S-2 state. At pH 4.5, about 50% of the split signal was induced, as compared to the amplitude of the signal that was induced at pH 6.5-7, using similar illumination conditions. Thus, the split-signal induction decreased with an apparent pK(a) of 4.5. In the same samples, the stable multiline signal from the S-2 state, which is modified by the removal of Call, was decreased by the illumination to same extent at all pHs. It is proposed that decreased induction of the S2YZ. state at lower pH was not due to inability to oxidize the modified S-2 state induced by the Ca2+ depletion. Instead, we propose that the low pH makes Y-Z(.) able to oxidize the S-2 state, making the S-2 --> S-3 transition available in Ca2+-depleted PSII. Implications of these results for the catalytic role of Call and the role of proton transfer between the Mn cluster and Y-Z during oxygen evolution is discussed.									17	0	1	0	9	0	18			0006-2960			WOS:000183024200024	12755621

The influence of Gd doping on the structural, morphological, photocatalytic, and magnetic properties of the GBFO particles was then investigated. Structural analyses revealed that a gradual crystal symmetry transition from rhombohedral to orthorhombic occurred in the BiFeO3 (BFO) particles with increasing Gd doping level. X-ray photoelectron spectra showed a decrease in the number of oxygen defect states upon Gd doping. The photocatalytic activity of the prepared GBFO particles was studied by monitoring the photocatalytic decomposition of methylene blue and rhodamine B under visible light irradiation. The results showed that with increasing Gd doping levels, the degradation efficiencies increased up to an optimal value and then decreased. A maximum degradation efficiency was obtained for the GBFO particles doped with 5% Gd, which could be ascribed to the lower amounts of impurity phases and surface oxygen defect states, resulting in a higher number of charge carriers available to produce hydroxyl radicals, thereby enhancing the photodegradation efficiency. Magnetic measurements revealed an initial gradual increase in the magnetization values with increasing Gd doping concentration, which could be due to the breakdown of crystal symmetry and destruction of the cycloidal spin structure following the incorporation of Gd in the BFO lattice.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			2053-1591			WOS:000488095200003

Samples of Triticum aestivum L. seeds were heated at 150, 200, 225 and 250 degreesC for periods up to 5 h. There were two distinct patterns of weight loss during heating, one due to expulsion of water and the other involving more substantial organic changes. Blue fluorescing material, typical of the intermediate compounds in the Maillard reaction, was observed after longer periods of heating and/or exposure to the higher temperatures. At each temperature there was a sharp initial decrease in the DNA content of the seeds followed by a gradual reduction in the rate of decay. At 150 and 200 degreesC, the DNA decay appeared to level off with very little additional breakdown occurring after 2 h, but at 225 and 250 degreesC the DNA content of the seeds reached undetectable levels at some point during the heating period. Polymerase chain reactions (PCRs) were used to study the degradation of the nuclear and mitochondrial genomes. PCRs were successful with seeds heated at 150 and 200 degreesC for all time points up to and including 5 h. At 225 and 250 degreesC, both PCRs failed after shorter periods of heating. The mitochondrial product was more resistant to heating, as expected as the mitochondrial genome is present at a higher copy number than the nuclear genome. PCR products from the mitochondrial locus were cloned and sequenced to determine if heating had any effect on the accuracy of sequence information obtained from charred wheat seeds. The frequencies of sequencing errors were similar, and low, in all six samples that were studied. All aspects of seed and DNA degradation were delayed in low-oxygen samples compared with the equivalent aerobic material. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Through the architecture designs, we have proposed an edge-rich MoS2 nanoarray grown on an edge-oriented three-dimensional (3D) graphene (termed as the 3D-graphene/E-MoS2) via chemical vapor deposition. Unlike the two-dimensional (2D) graphene, the highly conductive and transparent 3D graphene film has been grown at oblique angles on glass (i.e., a graphene glass), providing the large exposed surface area for the loading of more photocatalysts. Then, the abundant photocatalytically active sites can be achieved in the subsequently deposited edge-rich MoS2 nanoarrays, which are significantly beneficial for photocatalytic hydrogen production. The theoretical and experimental studies have revealed the new finding in the substantial improvements of both optical and electrical properties based on the geometrically designed 3D-graphene/E-MoS2 structures. Optically, the excellent light absorption (wavelength range: 300-800 nm) is observed, which is attributed to the favorable energy band for the efficient charge transfer between the electronically interconnected graphene and MoS2, and orientation of the MoS2 crystal face array. Electrically, the edge-rich MoS2 grown on the edge-oriented 3D graphene glass can achieve the optimized charge transport along the 2D vector plane from MoS2 layers to graphene. Consequently, the new hybrid nanostructures exhibit excellent performance as an effective photocatalyst for hydrogen generation from photocatalytic water splitting. The measured hydrogen evolution rate (2232.7 mu mol/g/h) under white-light illumination is one of the highest among those photocatalysts reported to date.									70	2	0	0	7	0	70			2211-2855	2211-3282		WOS:000458419000039

Optimization of the growth conditions provides graphene sheets with controlled defect sites. The unique architecture of the vertically-aligned graphene sheets allows sufficient space for the ionic movement within the sheets and hence enhancing the catalytic activity. Further modification with ruthenium nanoparticles (Ru NPs) drop-casted on VA-G/NF improves the charge overpotential for lithium-oxygen (Li-O-2) battery cycles. Such reduction we believe is due to the easier passage of ions between the perpendicularly standing graphene sheets thereby providing ionic channels.									12	1	0	0	0	0	12			0957-4484	1361-6528		WOS:000447213800001	30240363

The experimental tractability of this association has helped researchers characterize many of the colonization events necessary for symbiosis. Recent technological advances, such as the sequenced genome of V. fischeri, DNA microarrays, and high-throughput transcriptomics and proteomics, have allowed for the identification of host and symbiont factors that are important in establishing and maintaining specificity in the association. We highlight some of these findings pertaining to quorum sensing, luminescence, responses to reactive oxygen and nitrogen species, recognition of microbe-associated molecular patterns by the innate immune system of the host, and a diel rhythm that helps regulate the symbiont population. We also discuss how comparative genomics has allowed the identification of symbiont factors important for specificity and why sequencing the host's genome should be a priority for the research community.									15	0	0	0	12	0	15			0006-3185	1939-8697		WOS:000309089500010	22983036

The fully expanded second leaves of wheat plants (Triticum aestivum L. cv Avalon) were fumigated with either 200 or 400 nanomoles per mole O3 for between 4 and 16 hours. This reduced significantly the light-saturated rate of CO2 uptake and was accompanied by a parallel decrease in stomatal conductance. However, the stomatal limitation, estimated from the relationship between CO2 uptake and the internal CO2 concentration, only increased significantly during the first 8 hours of exposure to 400 nanomoles per mole O3; no significant increase occurred for any of the other treatments. Analysis of the response of CO2 uptake to the internal CO2 concentration implied that the predominant factor responsible for the reduction in lightsaturated CO2 uptake was a decrease in the efficiency of carboxylation. This was 58 and 21% of the control value after 16 hours at 200 and 400 nanomoles per mole O3, respectively. At saturating concentrations of CO2, photosynthesis was inhibited by no more than 22% after 16 hours, indicating that the capacity for regeneration of ribulose bisphosphate was less susceptible to O3. Ozone fumigations also had a less pronounced effect on light-limited photosynthesis. The maximum quantum yield of CO2 uptake and the quantum yield of oxygen evolution showed no significant decline after 16 hours with 200 nanomoles per mole O3, requiring 8 hours at 400 nanomoles per mole O3 before a significant reduction occurred. The photochemical efficiency of photosystem II estimated from the ratio of variable to maximum chlorophyll fluorescence and the atrazine-binding capacity of isolated thylakoids demonstrated that photochemical reactions were not responsible for the initial inhibition of CO2 uptake. The results suggest that the apparent carboxylation efficiency appears to be the initial cause of decline in photosynthesis in vivo following acute O3 fumigation.									166	8	0	0	155	0	177			0032-0889	1532-2548		WOS:A1991EY88400030	16668016

It has been reported that P. oryzae infects the leaves and roots of rice via different mechanisms. However, it is unclear to what extent the tissue types affect the host specificities of P. oryzae and P. grisea. Here, we evaluated the tissue-specific infection strategies of P. oryzae and P. grisea in various gramineous plants. Generally, mycelial plug inoculation caused root browning but the degree of browning did not simply follow the disease index on leaves. Interestingly, the Triticum and Digitaria pathotypes caused strong root growth inhibition in rice, wheat, and barley. Moreover, the Digitaria pathotype inhibited root branching only in rice. Culture filtrate reproduced these inhibitory effects on root, suggesting that some secreted molecules are responsible for the inhibitions. Observation of root sections revealed that most of the infection hyphae penetrated intercellular spaces and further extended into root cells, regardless of pathotype and host plant. The infection hyphae of Digitaria and Triticum pathotypes tended to localize in the outer layer of rice roots, but not in those of wheat and barley roots. The infection hyphae of the Oryza pathotype were distributed in both the intercellular and intracellular spaces of rice root cells. Pathogenesis-related genes and reactive oxygen species accumulation were induced after root inoculation with all combinations. These results suggest that resistance reactions were induced in the roots of gramineous plants against the infection with Pyricularia isolates but failed to prevent fungal invasion.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1464-6722	1364-3703		WOS:000839389500001	35957505

Previously we have established automated microwell methods for rapid data collection and hybrid kinetic modelling techniques for quantification of kinetic constants. In this work these methods are applied to explore the substrate selectivity and kinetics of monoamine oxidase, MAO-N-D5, from Aspergillus niger. In particular we examine the MAO-N-D5 variant Ile246Met/Asn336Ser/Met348Lys/Thr384Asn to allow the oxidation of secondary amines Initial screening showed that MAO-N-D5 enabled the selective oxidation of secondary amines in 8 and 9 carbon rings, as well as primary ethyl and propyl amines attached to secondary amines of indolines and pyrrolidines. Subsequently we developed a first kinetic model for the MAO-N-D5 enzyme based on the ping-pong bi-bi mechanism (similar to that for the human MAO-A enzyme). The full set of kinetic parameters were then established for three MAO-N-D5 substrates namely; 3-azabicyclo[3,3,0]octane, 1-(2 amino ethyl) pyrrolidine and 3-(2,3-dihydro-1H-indole-1-yl)propan-1-amine. The models for each amine substrate showed excellent agreement with experimentally determined progress curves over a range of operating conditions. They indicated that in each case amine inhibition was the main determinant of overall reaction rate rather than oxygen or imine (product) inhibition. From the perspective of larger scale bioconversion process design, the models indicated the need for fed-batch addition of the amine substrate and to increase the dissolved oxygen levels in order to maximize bioconversion process productivity.

We have studied the involvement of amine groups of the PS II proteins in photoligation of Mn2+ to the apo water-oxidizing complex, using the combined techniques of photoactivation and chemical modification with the modifiers methyl acetimidate (MAI), acetic acid N-hydroxysuccinimide ester (NHS), and 2,4,6-trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid (TNBS). Chemical modification of hydroxylamine-treated PS II core complexes decreased their capacity for restoration of oxygen evolution and photoligation of Mn2+ to the apo water-oxidizing complex (WOC), but did not affect their electron transfer activity in the vicinity of PS II. The number of functional high-affinity Mn-binding sites, but not of low-affinity sites, was significantly modulated by chemical modification. Kinetic analysis of photoactivation with the repetitive flashes revealed that the intermediate generated during a photoactivation process was destabilized by the chemical modification. To identify which proteins possess the amine groups involved in ligation of functional Mn, we examined the difference in NHS biotinylation between PS II core complexes with and without the Mn cluster. NHS biotinylation resulting in altered ligation of functional Mn apparently occurred on three proteins: an antenna chlorophyll binding protein (CP47), a light-harvesting chlorophyll protein (CP29), and another chlorophyll binding protein (PS II-S). Of these proteins, only the Mn-dependent biotinylation of CP47 was found to occur independently of the application of an NHS-masking concentration before removal of the functional Mn. These results suggest that lysyl residues of CP47, and perhaps also CP29 and PS II-S, function in direct photoligation of Mn2+ to the apo WOC.									12	0	0	0	7	0	12			0006-2960			WOS:000173787400032	11827544	
J	BARRETT, TJ; MACLEAN, WH; CATTALANI, S; HOY, L								MASSIVE SULFIDE DEPOSITS OF THE NORANDA AREA, QUEBEC .5. THE CORBET MINE								CANADIAN JOURNAL OF EARTH SCIENCES				30	9			1934	1954		10.1139/e93-171				SEP 1993	1993	The Corbet deposit is located in the upper part of the Flavrian andesite, the lowest volcanic formation within cycle III of the Noranda Central Mine Sequence. The deposit consisted of one main lens of massive sulfides, and several smaller lenses, and contained 2.7 x 10(6) t of mineable ore at 2.92% Cu, 1.98% Zn, 20.6 g/t Ag, and 1.0 g/t Au. The orebody had a massive pyrrhotite - chalcopyrite core, which passed laterally into massive pyrite - sphalerite. The northwestern part of the orebody is overlain by 50-100 m of Flavrian andesite, whereas the southeastern portion is overlain by Northwest rhyolite.Lavas within the Flavrian andesite and the lower Northwest rhyolite are low in K2O (<0.5%), and are partly of tholeiitic affinity, and partly of transitional affinity. The tholeiitic volcanic series has Zr/Y ratios of 2.8 to 4.5, whereas the transitional series has Zr/Y ratios of 4.5 to 7.1. The two series are also distinct in plots of Nb-Zr, Yb-Zr, Nb-Y, and the rare earth elements. These data indicate that two slightly different magma types existed in the chamber that fed this portion of the extrusive Central Mine Sequence.Alteration is most intense in the breccias of the upper Flavrian andesite, within approximately 50 m of the orebody, and is almost entirely chloritic. There is no zone of silicification, although moderate sericitization occurs lateral to and above the orebody. Mass-change calculations indicate that large amounts of SiO2 and CaO + Na2O were leached from the rocks by hydrothermal solutions, whereas large amounts of hydrothermal Feo and seawater MgO were added.Oxygen isotope depletions are among the largest in the Noranda area and extend laterally and vertically up to 300 m from the orebody. Within this volume, deltaO-18 values of altered volcanic rocks have been decreased to values as low as 2 to -2 part per thousand. These depletions result from reactions with seawater at approximately 250-300-degrees-C and from strong silica leaching, as indicated by mass-change calculations. The hydrothermal system at Corbet can be assessed using two lithogeochemical tools: calculated mass changes and oxygen isotope ratios, both of which are sensitive to water-rock ratio and temperature.									21	0	0	0	0	0	21			0008-4077	1480-3313		WOS:A1993MQ64400016

NdhF is a subunit of the type 1, multisubunit NADH:plastoquinone oxidoreductase (NADH dehydrogenase). The nucleotide sequence of the gene predicts an extremely hydrophobic protein of 664 amino acids with a calculated mass of 72.9 kDa. The ndhF gene was shown to be single copy and transcribed into a monocistronic mRNA of 2,300 nucleotides. An ndhF null mutation was successfully constructed by interposon mutagenesis, demonstrating that NdhF is not required for cell viability under photoautotrophic growth conditions. The mutant strain exhibited a negligible rate of oxygen uptake in the dark, but its photosynthetic properties (oxygen evolution, chlorophyll/P700 ratio, and chlorophyll/P680 ratio) were generally similar to those of the wild type. Although the ndhF mutant strain grew as rapidly as the wild-type strain at high light intensity, the mutant grew more slowly than the wild type at lower light intensities and did not grow at all under photoheterotrophic conditions. The roles of the NADH:plastoquinone oxidoreductase in photosynthetic and respiratory electron transport are discussed.									27	3	0	0	27	0	32			0021-9193	1098-5530		WOS:A1993LE43100012	8501038

The calculation methods are roughly categorized into two types: calculations on electrically neutral surfaces and electrified surfaces. The former methods have been successfully applied to reproduce observed trends in catalytic activities and to design new materials. The methods, however, cannot evaluate any electrochemical properties originated from surface electrifications. By this reason, several theoretical methods on electrified interfaces have been proposed. The methods can provide properties originated from charge transfers, such as electrosorption valency values, symmetry factors and potential-dependent spectroscopies, within self-consistent manners. Many limitations, however, still exist, and further studies are necessary particularly on effects of dynamical atomic motions on free energies.									11	0	0	0	0	0	11			2451-9103			WOS:000442793300017

The oxidative coupling of amines was demonstrated to be a promising one pot synthetic procedure for imines, and considerable efforts have been devoted to it. A new type of catalyst based on Mo2C was successfully prepared by roasting the mixture synthesized by using the interaction between ionic bonds with dopamine (DA) and phosphomolybdate (PMo). In a typical procedure, solid product was pyrolyzed in a tube furnace at 800 degrees C for 3 h in N-2 with heating rate of 5 degrees C/min, and the sample PDA-PMo-800 was achieved. The catalyst was characterized and analyzed by Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR), N-2 adsorption desorption (BET), scanning electron microscope (SEM), transmission electron microscope (TEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and Raman spectrometer (Raman), thermo gravimetric analyzer (TG), energy dispersive spectrometer (EDS). It was found that the catalyst had morphologies of flower shaped spheres and certain specific surface area (102 m(2).g(-1)). As a catalyst, it can be used in the oxidation coupling reaction of benzyl amine to synthesize the imine under the condition of no solvent and oxygen as oxidant. Typically, amine (5 mmol) and catalyst (0.03 g) was added into a 25 mL sealed round-bottomed flask and kept vigorously stirring at 100 degrees C under O-2 balloon for 10 h. After completion, the catalyst was separated by centrifugation with N,N-dimethylformamide, washed with ethanol, dried in a vacuum, and reused for the next time. The filtrate was identified by GC-MS, and the conversion and yield were analyzed by GC (SP-6890A) equipped with a FID detector. The results showed that a high conversion rate and selection rate can be achieved. And the catalyst can be used repeatedly and maintained a high conversion rate under the same conditions. The successful design of this catalyst not only combines metal materials with organic materials, but also makes a preparation for transition metals to replace noble metals. In addition, carbonized metal was used as a catalyst for coupling reaction, which provided a new idea for the application of carbonized metals to organic reactions.									2	2	0	0	0	0	2			0567-7351			WOS:000466287100007

In this study, the effect of acid (H2SO4 and HF) on the photocatalytic degradation of Rhodamine B (RhB) over g-C3N4 was studied. It was found that the degradation of RhB was greatly enhanced in the presence of acid, and superoxide (O-2(center dot-)) is the predominant reactive oxygen species (ROSs) that are responsible for the efficient degradation of RhB. It is proposed that acidification of g-C3N4 results in the formation of a new surface state, which is 0.3 eV below the conduction band position of g-C3N4. The formed surface state can act as a trapping site for photo-generated electrons, which retards the recombination of the electron-hole pairs, enhancing the photocatalytic activity of g-C3N4.

In this study, we use the ionic and stable isotopic composition of interstitial waters and the petrology, mineralogy, and stable isotopic composition of authigenic carbonates collected from Ocean Drilling Program (ODP) Leg 174A (Sites 1071 and 1072) to constrain the origin of the carbonates and the evolution of methane on the outer New Jersey shelf. The pore fluids of the New Jersey continental shelf are characterized by (1) a fresh-brackish water plume, and (2) organic matter degradation reactions, which proceed through sulfate reduction. However, only minor methanogenesis occurs. The oxygen isotopic composition of the pore fluids supports a meteoric origin of the low salinity fluids. Authigenic carbonates are found in nodules, thin (similar to1-cm) layers, and carbonate cemented pavements. Siderite is the most common authigenic carbonate, followed by dolomite and calcite. The oxygen isotopic composition of the authigenic carbonates, i.e. 1.3-6.5parts per thousand PeeDee Belemnite (PDB), indicates an origin in marine pore fluids. The carbon isotopic composition of dolomite cements range from -16.4 to -8.8 parts per thousand PDB, consistent with formation within the zone of sulfate reduction. Siderite delta(13)C, values show a greater range (-17.67-16.4parts per thousand), but are largely positive (mean = 2.8 parts per thousand) and are interpreted to have formed throughout the zone of methanogenesis. In contrast, calcite delta(13)C values are highly negative (as low as -41.7 parts per thousand) and must have formed from waters with a large component of dissolved inorganic carbon derived from methane oxidation.Pore water data show that despite complete sulfate reduction, methanogenesis appears not to be an important process presently occurring in the upper 400 m of the outer New Jersey shelf. In contrast, the carbon isotopic composition of the siderites and calcites document an active methanogenic zone during their formation. The methane may have been either oxidized or vented from shelf sediments, perhaps during sea-level fluctuations. If this unaccounted and variable methane flux is an areally important process during Neogene sea-level fluctuations, then it likely plays an important role in long-term carbon cycling on passive continental margins.

The formalism is applied to calculate the photoabsorption and the electromagnetic (EM) differential cross sections of El excitations in neutron-rich oxygen and calcium isotopes. The calculated photoabsorption cross sections agree reasonably well with the available data for O-16,O-18 and Ca-40,Ca-48. The results of calculations show that the change of the fraction of the El integrated strength in the region of pygmy dipole resonance (PDR) as a function of mass number A with increasing neutron number N is in agreement with the recent experimental data, and does not follow the prediction by the simple cluster model. The EM differential cross sections obtained within PDM in this work show prominent PDR peaks below 15 MeV for O-20,O-22 in agreement with the recent experimental observation. It is also shown that, using low-energy RI beams at around 50-60 MeV/nucleon, one can observe clean and even enhanced PDR peaks without the admixture with the GDR in the EM differential cross sections of neutron-rich nuclei.

The enhancement of photocatalytic activity is attributed to the enlarged specific surface area, remarkably narrowed band gap (2.28 eV) and fast electron transportation benefit from the porous structure.

We adapt the wet chemical "urea glass" method for pure transition metal nitrides to single-phase mixed-metal titanium niobium nitrides for a range of niobium mole fractions. We then oxidize the nitrides by heating in air to prepare titanium niobium oxynitride that absorbs visible light of lambda <= 550 nm. The materials are characterized by powder X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, and diffuse reflectance UV-vis spectroscopy. Their photochemical activity as a function of Nb fraction is benchmarked with methylene blue photomineralization promoted by full-spectrum AM 1.5G solar irradiation with and without a lambda <= 400 nm cut-on filter. First-order Langmuir-Hinshelwood rate constants for photomineralization reveal a composition with similar to 8% Nb to have superior reactivity. Full compositional analysis by Kjeldahl chemical nitrogen determination and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy yields a chemical formula of Ti0.92Nb0.08O1.97N0.03. Finally, electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy correlates a localized Nb4+ defect with increased photochemical reaction rate.									7	0	0	0	0	1	7			1477-9226	1477-9234		WOS:000411224500013	28885629

The two-stage burner technique produced soot particles from different fuels in the first burner and then oxidized the particles under either fuel lean or rich conditions in the secondary burner. Methyl decanoate/n-dodecane (surrogate for biodiesel/diesel) and n-butanol/n-dodecane (alcohol/diesel) were studied and compared with previous results using pure m-xylene, pure n-dodecane, and m-xylene/n-dodecane mixtures (surrogate for conventional jet fuel (JP-8)). Particle size distributions, determined using samples taken from the center line of the secondary burner and characterized by a scanning mobility particle sizer, were used to determine the experimental oxidation rates. The evolution of major gas-phase species was measured experimentally by an online GC, and kinetic modeling was used to predict the concentration of OH radicals. The results revealed two regions in the flame: (i) a region close to the burner surface with a high O-2, concentration and (ii) a region where OH was formed and the O-2 concentration dropped. A power-law form of the kinetic rate was fitted to the experimental oxidation rates in the first region of flames where oxidation via O-2 dominated close to the burner surface and OH was not yet formed. The fit yielded an activation energy between 120.3 and 149.3 kJ mol(-1) with an average of 134.8 kJ mol(-1). The average of the pre-exponential factor, A, was found to be 1600 with an order in molecular oxygen of 0.76, resulting in a kinetic rate equation of Wo(2) (g cm(-2) s(-1)) = 1600 X T(-0.5)exp[(-134.8 +/- 14.5)/RT](Po-2)(0.76). The method was applied to calculate the oxidation rate of soot over the effective experimental temperature range 1350-1750 K and O-2 partial pressures from 0.065 to 0.123 atm. A comparison of the proposed model with the rates obtained for soot samples derived from the same fuels but oxidized in a thermographimetric analyzer showed that the proposed model can be extended to temperatures as low as 750 K. The reaction rate depended on the fuel source and flame condition, and some rates were over 1 order of magnitude higher than rates obtained from Nagle and Strickland-Constable.									14	0	0	0	0	0	14			0887-0624	1520-5029		WOS:000374804400099		
J	Zhu, Lin; Chen, Ren-Xu; Zheng, Yong-Fei; He, Qiang; Xia, Qiong-Xia; Wang, Zhi-Min								Multistage growth of garnet fingerprints the behavior and property of metamorphic fluids in a Paleotethyan oceanic subduction zone								LITHOS				430						106851	10.1016/j.lithos.2022.106851				NOV 15 2022	2022	Metamorphic fluids released from the subducting crust are of great importance to understand the recycling of volatile materials at convergent plate margins. Garnet in metamorphic rocks can retain chemical zonation and crystal inclusions produced during crustal subduction, providing the record of geochemical recycling in subduction zones. This paper presents a combined study of mineralogy and geochemistry for metamorphic garnets in oceanic-type eclogite from the Paleotethyan subduction zone in the Hong'an orogen, east-central China. The results show distinct zonation of major and trace elements, crystal inclusions, water contents, and oxygen fugacity in garnet. Five stages of garnet growth were recognized based on the garnet composition and phase equilibrium modelling. Growth of Stage I to IV garnets occurs during prograde metamorphism of the Paleotethyan oceanic crust from blueschist to eclogite facies along low geothermal gradients of 7.8-9.7 degrees C/km. Stage V garnet was formed through dissolution and reprecipitation during mineral-fluid reaction in the early exhumation stage. Garnet grains exhibit a decrease of water content from core to rim, indicating a gradual decrease of bulk water content in host eclogite during the garnet growth. Combined with the theoretical calculation based on the mineral modes and mineral water contents, it is suggested that the subducting oceanic crust would release reduced amounts of fluids during prograde metamorphism from greenschist to eclogite facies. The different garnet zones have fO2 values varying from Delta FMQ+1.77 to Delta FMQ+3.26, suggesting that the fluids released from the subducting oceanic crust were oxidizing during subduction to peak eclogite facies and its early exhumation stage. These garnet fO2 values are correlated with the water contents of water-saturated garnet, implying that the water content of metamorphic garnet is a potential means to recover the redox state of its host eclogite. The increase of fO2 values during prograde metamorphism of the eclogite indicates the breakdown of chlorite and possible fluid influx from serpentinite, whereas the significant drop of fO2 values during the early exhumation stage indicates the breakdown of lawsonite to release the oxidized fluid. This study demonstrates that a combined study of water content, major and trace elements, and mineral inclusions in metamorphic garnet can potentially provide a new perspective into the behavior and property of fluids released from the subducting oceanic crust.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0024-4937	1872-6143		WOS:000860203500001

Utilizing the interaction between the metal and the support is one of the most essential strategies to enhance electrocatalytic efficiency due to structural and synergetic promotion. To date, as the ideal model for realizing EMSI, many types of single-atom catalysts (SACs) have been developed. The understanding of the electronic interaction on SACs has also been pushed to a higher level. However, systematic theories and operando experiments are seldom reported, and will be necessary to put forward and be carried out, respectively. Herein, the types, characterization, mechanism, and electrocatalytic applications of EMSI are comprehensively summarized and discussed. In addition to the basic information above, the challenges, opportunities, and future development of the EMSI on SACs are also proposed to present an overall view and reference to the later research.									219	21	0	0	16	0	221			0935-9648	1521-4095		WOS:000585028100001	33125802

Herein, template-assisted, scalable Fe-implanted N-doped porous carbon nanotube networks (Fe-N-CNNs) have been synthesized based on an environmentally friendly template hydroxyapatite nanowires (HAP NWs). Thanks to the hierarchical meso/micropores, high specific surface area, and abundant active sites, the optimized Fe-N-CNNs exhibit excellent oxygen reduction activity. Furthermore, the Zn-air batteries based on the Fe-N-CNNs cathode deliver a high discharge voltage of 1.27 V at a current density of 20 mA cm(-2) and a large peak power density of 202.2 mW cm(-2). More far-reaching, this HAP-based template strategy opens a new avenue toward the mass production of efficient, cost-effective electrocatalysts, and the Fe-N-CNNs with hollow interiors are expected to extend their other potential uses in energy storage, molecular sieves, adsorbents, and biomedical engineering.									10	1	0	0	0	0	10			0947-6539	1521-3765		WOS:000455809700033	30351499	
J	Li, Qian; Zhang, Yuanyuan; Dong, Lin; Guo, Zhaojie								Oligocene syndepositional lacustrine dolomite: A study from the southern Junggar Basin, NW China								PALAEOGEOGRAPHY PALAEOCLIMATOLOGY PALAEOECOLOGY				503				69	80		10.1016/j.palaeo.2018.04.004				AUG 15 2018	2018	Despite the continuously growing understanding of dolomite over the years, the dolomite problem remains unclear. Lacustrine dolomite found in the Anjihaihe Formation (E(3)a) on the margin of the southern Junggar Basin provides an opportunity to look into the dolomite formation process in a lacustrine environment. The Anjihaihe dolomite occurs as 10- to 20-cm-thick white-gray layers interbedded with lacustrine dark mudstone and silty mudstone. Based on scanning electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, major and trace elements, and carbon and oxygen isotopes, as well as magnesium isotope analyses, the Anjihaihe dolomite is a syndepositional low-order dolomicrite formed under a reducing environment in a saline lake. Unlike the usual bacterial sulfate reduction and evaporation background of lacustrine dolomite, no bacteria or evaporite evidence is found in this study. Rather, increased Mg concentrations and carboxyl group catalysis may be the main factors that facilitate the dolomitization process. The results of a one-dimensional diffusion-advection-reaction numerical model of the Mg isotopes indicate that the dolomitization time, degree of dolomitization and diffusion in thin dolomite layers have little effect on the Mg isotopes in the Anjihaihe dolomicrite. Under the assumptions that seawater delta Mg-26 equals -0.82 parts per thousand and the fractionation factor is 1.7 parts per thousand at 25 degrees C, seawater as the Mg source for the Anjihaihe dolomicrite would be a plausible explanation and fits well with our other results. This explanation suggests that the contemporaneous adjacent proto-Paratethys might have provided the magnesium ions by episodic transgression and had a paleoenvironmental influence on the northern Tianshan area during the Oligocene.									7	0	0	0	1	0	7			0031-0182	1872-616X		WOS:000435624600006

CFO photocathodes grown on fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) substrates are investigated for photoelectrochemical (PEC) water reduction for hydrogen generation. CFO photocathode fabricated at 550 degrees C with an optimal film thickness of similar to 150 nm exhibit a maximum photocurrent density of similar to 0.71 mA cm(-2) at 0.6 V vs. RHE under a standard 1 SUN illumination (AM 1.5G, 100 mW cm(-2)) in 1 M NaOH electrolyte (pH 13.5) under ambient conditions. The performance is further improved in a O-2-saturated solution yielding higher photocurrent density as high as similar to 1.3 mA cm(-2) at 0.6 V vs. RHE, with O-2 serving as a sacrificial agent. CFO film absorbs over the entire visible wavelength range and delivers maximum incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) values of similar to 18% and similar to 28% at 0.6 V vs. RHE (at 400 nm) in unpurged and O-2-saturated NaOH solution, respectively. The enhancement in PEC and IPCE with O-2 purging is due to combined effects of water reduction and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). Mott-Schottky study demonstrate an improvement in onset potential with higher carrier density for the CFO films as compared to previous reports. Overall, the enhanced PEC performance is attributed to the high-quality growth of crystalline CFO thin films on FTO substrates by DLI-CVD technique, exhibiting good stability in different electro-chemical environments.

Nitrogen, oxygen, and hydrogen atoms and CN radicals were produced by instantaneously heating a CO-N-2-H2O gas mixture to 10 000 K. These plasma species were rapidly cooled to form an amorphous film containing amino acid precursors by directly colliding against a wall of a glass tube. This is a new method of producing amino acid precursors without involving the reaction among hydrogen cyanide (HCN), formaldehyde (H2CO), and ammonia (NH3); HCN, H2CO, and NH3 are generally considered important intermediates in amino acid formation. Spark discharge (SD), which is a typical electric discharge in amino acid synthesis, was also characterized by OES. Only CN radicals were observed in a CO-N-2-H2O mixture plasma. These radicals became more stable molecules by colliding against other molecules, and sufficiently cooled molecules were dissolved in water. Although HCN appeared to have been formed by SD, amino acids were not effectively synthesized. Therefore, the high activation and rapid cooling processes should be important for the amino acid formation from a CO-N-2-H2O gas mixture. (C) 1999 American Institute of Physics.

To address this issue, this work presented a novel process termed biocathode-electrocatalytic reactor (BECR). The dual-chamber BECR employed O-2-reducing biocathode instead of normal stainless steel (SS) cathode and MnOx/Ti anode to reduce O-2 in the cathode chamber and treat methylene blue (MB) in the anode chamber, respectively. BECR successfully started up at 0.7 and 1 V and substantially improved MB and total organic carbon (TOC) removal compared with the electrocatalytic reactor with SS cathode (ECR-SS), e.g., removal of MB (150 mg L-1) increased from 27.0 +/- 0.2% to 78.1 +/- 0.4% at 1 V. To achieve the same TOC removal, BECR reduced the energy consumption by approximately 45.7% compared with ECR-SS (19.5 and 35.9 kWh (kg TOC)(-1) for BECR and ECR, respectively). To explain the above merits of BECR, M(center dot OH) (center dot OH adsorbed on the anode surface) generation, potential of MnOx/Ti anode (E-a), and their correlation were investigated. When coupled with O-2 -reducing biocathode, MnOx /Ti anode considerably accelerated M(center dot OH) generation because E-a increased. The increased E-a in BECR was due to the fact that its cathodic reaction was converted to the four-electron O-2 reduction, which exhibited a higher cathodic potential than hydrogen evolution reaction on SS cathode in ECR-SS. Thereby, BECR simultaneously promoted dye removal and reduced energy consumption, showing promise in treating dyeing wastewater.

An amphiphilic block copolymer-F68 was used as a soft template for the synthesis of mesoporous carbon nitride. The structural and photophysical properties of the as-prepared catalysts were characterized by X-ray powder diffraction, elemental analysis, N-2-adsorption measurement, transmission electron microscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, differential scanning calorimeter and UV-Vis absorption as well as time-resolved picosecond emission spectroscopy. The photocatalytic activity of the samples was evaluated by H-2 evolution from water under visible light irradiation and the degradation of rose bengal (RB). The mesoporous CNT materials prepared with Pluronic F68 as template showed markedly higher activity compared to bulk carbon nitride, which can be attributed to its crystallinity, hierarchical porous structure and the enlarged surface area. The catalyst was relatively stable as proven by recycling experiments. Besides, the addition of H2O2 promoted the formation of active center dot OH radicals and increased the activity of carbon nitride for photodegradation of rose bengal. The carbon nitrides prepared by solution reactions were of very poor activity both in photocatalytic water splitting and rose bengal degradation. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

One of the key issues facing the green hydrogen evolution is the construction of efficient, low-cost electrocatalysts. Prussian blue (PB), Prussian blue analogs (PBAs), and their derivatives have tunable metal centers and have attracted significant interest as novel photo- and electrochemical catalysts. In this review, recent research progress into PB/PBA-based hollow structures, substrate-supported nanostructures, and their derivatives for green water splitting is discussed and summarized. First, several remarkable examples of nanostructured PB/PBAs supported on substrates (copper foil, carbon cloth, and nickel foam) and hollow structures (such as single-shelled hollow boxes, open hollow cages, and intricate hollow structures (multi-shell and yolk-shell)) are discussed in detail, including their synthesis and formation mechanisms. Subsequently, the applications of PB/PBA derivatives ((hydr)oxides, phosphides, chalcogenides, and carbides) for water splitting are discussed. Finally, the limitations in this research area and the most urgent challenges are summarized. We hope that this review will stimulate more researchers to develop technologies based on these intricate PB/PBA structures and their derivatives for highly efficient, green water splitting.

Present in many bacteria and in animals, it catalyzes the conversion of (2R)-methylmalonyl-CoA to (2S)-methylmalonyl-CoA, the substrate for the B-12-dependent enzyme, methylmalonyl-CoA mutase. Defects in this pathway can result in severe acidosis and cause damage to the central nervous system in humans.Results: The crystal structure of MMCE from Propionibacterium shermanii has been determined at 2.0 Angstrom resolution. The MMCE monomer is folded into two tandem beta alpha beta beta beta modules that pack edge-to-edge to generate an 8-stranded beta sheet. Two monomers then pack back-to-back to create a tightly associated dimer. In each monomer, the beta sheet curves around to create a deep cleft, in the floor of which His12, Gln65, His91, and Glu141 provide a binding site for a divalent metal ion, as shown by the binding of Co2+. Modeling 2-methylmalonate into the active site identifies two glutamate residues as the likely essential bases for the epimerization reaction.Conclusions: The beta alpha beta beta beta modules of MMCE correspond with those found in several other proteins, including bleomycin resistance protein, glyoxalase I, and a family of extradiol dioxygenases. Differences in connectivity are consistent with the evolution of these very different proteins from a common precursor by mechanisms of gene duplication and domain swapping. The metal binding residues also align precisely, and striking structural similarities between MMCE and glyoxalase I suggest common mechanisms in their respective epimerization and isomerization reactions.									51	0	0	0	41	0	72			0969-2126	1878-4186		WOS:000169766500009	11470438

This chapter reviews the primary, secondary, tertiary, and quaternary structures of PSII as well as the function of its constituent subunits. The understanding of in vivo organization of PSII is based in part on freeze-etched and freeze-fracture images of thylakoid membranes. These images show a resolution of about 40-50 Angstrom and so provide information mainly on the localization heterogeneity, dimensions, and shapes of membrane-embedded PSII complexes. Higher resolution of about 15-40 Angstrom has been obtained from single particle images of isolated PSII complexes of defined and differing subunit composition and from electron crystallography of 2-D crystals. Observations are discussed in terms of the oligomeric state and subunit organization of PSII and its antenna components.									276	17	1	0	240	1	298			1040-2519			WOS:A1997XD14000025	15012277

Here, we demonstrate that CoTe nanoparticles embedded in a nitrogen-doped hollow carbon polyhedron (CoTe@NC) can be adopted as a highly selective and stable 2e(-) ORR electrocatalyst. Benefiting from the synergistic effect between the highly active CoTe nanoparticles and nitrogen-doped hollow carbon polyhedron, in 0.1 M HClO4, the CoTe@NC hybrid exhibits superb electrocatalytic activity toward the 2e(-) ORR with high selectivity of up to 92.6% and a large H2O2 production rate of 297.9 ppm h(-1) at -0.044 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode. Moreover, it operates rather stably under the working conditions with a negligible current decrease after 12 h. Theoretical calculations further provide insight into the catalytic mechanism involved.									10	0	0	0	1	0	10			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000698133200001

However, the high activity of these catalysts cannot be sustained over a variety of pH ranges. In an effort to develop highly active and stable metal-contained catalysts, various approaches have been pursued with an emphasis on metal particle size reduction and doping on carbon-based supports. These techniques enhances the metal-support interactions, originating from the chemical bonding effect between the metal dopants and carbon support and the associated interface, as well as the charge transfer between the atomic metal species and carbon framework. This provides an opportunity to tune the well-defined metal active centers and optimize their activity, selectivity and stability of this type of (electro)catalyst. Herein, recent advances in synthesis strategies, characterization and catalytic performance of single atom metal dopants on carbon-based nanomaterials are highlighted with attempts to understand the electronic structure and spatial arrangement of individual atoms as well as their interaction with the supports. Applications of these new materials in a wide range of potential electrocatalytic processes in renewable energy conversion systems are also discussed with emphasis on future directions in this active field of research.									243	24	0	0	10	0	246			1613-6810	1613-6829		WOS:000402620700012	28402595

The structural and morphological characterizations have also been investigated and the information used to interpret the electrochemical behavior. An estimation of the electrode's capacitance and roughness factor has been obtained by means of cyclic voltammetry. The specific capacitance and consequently the roughness factor values are affected by the presence of Ce ions in the oxide. These findings are in agreement with the increase of the oxide-specific surface area by the introduction of Ce ion. The open-circuit potential and the voltammetric patterns are dependent on the presence of Ce ion in the electrodes and support that the surface electrochemistry of the perovskite oxide electrodes is governed by the Mn4+-Mn3+ redox couple.									14	1	0	0	0	0	15			1432-8488	1433-0768		WOS:000264485700016

However, the latter requirement is pernicious for the membrane and especially the cathode half-reaction since Pb2+ and Fe3+ precursors poison the state-of-the-art platinum H-2 evolving catalyst. To address this, we demonstrate the invariably stable operation of [Co-Fe-Pb]O-x in acidic solutions through a cobalt-selective self-healing mechanism without the addition of Pb2+ and Fe3+ and investigate the kinetics of the process. Soft X-ray absorption spectroscopy reveals that low concentrations of Co2+ in the solution stabilize the catalytically active Co(Fe) sites. The highly promising performance of this system is showcased by steady water electrooxidation at 80 +/- 1 degrees C and 10 mA cm(-2), using a flat electrode, at an overpotential of 0.56 +/- 0.01 V on a one-week timescale.									7	0	0	0	0	0	7			1433-7851	1521-3773		WOS:000661815200001	33884730

CeO2-based materials have emerged as predominant candidates for electrocatalysis, such as the excellent performance of Ni/CeO2 interfacial nanostructures on highly conductive carbon nanotubes. First, we provide a comprehensive review of the catalytic performance of varied of CeO2-based materials (nanostructured, supported, doped, hybrid, coated, amorphous CeO2-based materials) and the electrocatalytic mechanisms. Furthermore, we introduce two strategies to achieve better catalytic performance, which are increasing the number of active sites and increasing the intrinsic activity of each active site, providing reasonable guidance for the development of enhanced catalysts. Finally, we discuss the limitations and challenges of CeO2-based materials, followed by their present status and prospects for future research. We believe that this review will be helpful for researchers and scientists who are seeking promising electrocatalytic materials and useful electrocatalyst development strategies.									73	2	0	0	7	0	73			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000477988200001

Fuel-producing artificial systems that directly convert solar energy into fuels by mimicking natural photosynthesis are expected to achieve this goal. Among them, the conversion of solar energy into hydrogen energy through the photocatalytic water-splitting process over a particulate semiconductor is one of the most promising routes due to advantages such as simplicity, cheapness, and ease of large-scale production. Abundant metal oxide photocatalysts have been developed in the last century, but most are only active under UV-light irradiation. To harvest a much wider range of the solar spectrum, the development of photocatalysts with wide visible-light absorption bands has become increasingly popular this century. Herein, a brief overview of materials developed for promising solar water splitting, with an emphasis on a mixed-anion structure and wide visible-light absorption bands, is presented, with some basic information on the principles, approaches, and research progress on the photocatalytic water-splitting reaction with particulate semiconductors. Typical progress on research into one- and two-step (Z-scheme) overall water-splitting systems by utilizing mixed-anion photocatalysts is highlighted, together with research strategies and modification methods.									20	3	0	0	1	0	20			1864-5631	1864-564X		WOS:000471314900009	30211984

The key challenge for a practical M-N-C catalyst is to increase the density of atomic metal active sites that achieves the partial current density of CO (j(CO)) relevant to the industrial level at lower overpotentials. Here, we revealed the effect of physical and chemical properties of carbon substrates and synthetic processes on the tuning of the density of atomic metal active sites as well as the role of reaction chemistry in enhancing the j(CO) and reducing the overpotential. The achievable loading of NiN4 active site in the Ni-N-C is determined by the combined content of pyridinic and pyrrolic N functionalities and Ni-N coordination efficiency derived from the pyrolytic step rather than the uptake capability of Ni2+ in the adsorption step in the case of carbon black with high specific surface area (>1000 m(2)/g). The N dopant content can be improved by modifying oxygen functional groups on the surface of carbon black, optimizing the pyrolytic temperature, and iterating the doping step. Through a combination of all optimum factors, the resultant Ni-N-C catalyst has a maximum loading of-4.4 wt % for atomic Ni. This Ni-N-C catalyst exhibited Faradaic efficiency (FE) of CO of 97% and j(CO) of -152 mA cm(-2) at-0.93 V vs RHE in a flow cell using 0.5 M KHCO3 electrolyte while showing 93% FE of CO and jco of-67 mA cm(-2) at -0.61 V vs RHE at 1 M KOH. Adding KI to the base electrolyte significantly magnified the j(CO) to larger than -200 mA cm(-2) at a potential of -0.51 V vs RHE while maintaining the almost unity FE of CO. The Ni-N-C is compatible with the membrane-electrode-assembly-based electrolyzer in which the jco also achieved >200 mA cm(-2) at a cell voltage of around 2.7 V.									17	1	0	0	0	0	17			2574-0962			WOS:000516665300043

Model Studies on the Oxygen-Induced Formation of Benzaldehyde from Phenylacetaldehyde Using Pyrolysis GC-MS and FTIR								JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL AND FOOD CHEMISTRY				56	22			10697	10704		10.1021/jf8022468				NOV 26 2008	2008	Benzaldehyde, a potent aroma chemical of bitter almond, can also be formed thermally from phenylalanine and may contribute to the formation of off-aroma. To identify the precursors involved in its generation during Maillard reaction, various model systems containing phenylalanine, phenylpyruvic acid, phenethylamine, or phenylacetaldehyde were studied in the presence and absence of moisture using oxidative and nonoxidative Py-GC-MS. Analysis of the data indicated that phenylacetaldehyde, the Strecker aldehyde of phenylalanine, is the most effective precursor and that both air and water significantly enhanced the rate of benzaldehyde formation from phenylacetaldehyde. Phenylpyruvic acid was the most efficient precursor under nonoxidative conditions. Phenethylamine, on the other hand, needed the presence of a carbonyl compound to generate benzaldehyde only under oxidative conditions. On the basis of the results obtained, a free radical initiated oxidative cleavage of the carbon-carbon double bond of the enolized phenylacetaldehyde was proposed as a possible major mechanism for benzaldehyde formation, and supporting evidence was provided through monitoring of the evolution of the benzaldehyde band from heated phenylacetaldehyde in the presence and absence of 1,1'-azobis(cyclohexanecarbonitrile) on the ATR crystal of an FTIR spectrophotometer. In the presence of the free radical initiator, the enol band of the phenylacetaldehyde centered at 1684 cm(-1) formed and increased over time, and after 18 min of heating time the benzaldehyde band centered at 1697 cm(-1) formed-and increased at the expense of the enol band of phenylacetaldehyde, indicating a precursor product relationship.									68	11	0	0	49	0	80			0021-8561	1520-5118		WOS:000261056700039	18954073

Investigations revealed that the addition of MnMoO4 increases the electrocatalytic activity of the base electrode (40 wt%Pd/GNS) towards the methanol oxidation reaction (MOR) in 1 M KOH significantly. The catalytic activity of the electrode is found to be the greatest with 8 wt%MnMoO4. The addition of MnMoO4 also improves CO poisoning tolerance of the base electrode by 11-73%. The MOR activity and CO poisoning tolerance of the 40 wt%Pd-8 wt% MnMoO4/GNS hybrid electrode were superior to other electrodes of the investigation.

J	MANCHANDA, R; BRUDVIG, GW; CRABTREE, RH								CLUSTER-EXPANSION OF A HIGH-VALENT OXOMANGANESE DIMER IN AQUEOUS-SOLUTION								NEW JOURNAL OF CHEMISTRY				18	5			561	568						MAY 1994	1994	Upon dissolution in water, high-valent oxomanganese dimer, [Mn2III,IV (O)2(bpy)4]3+ (1, bpy = 2,2'-dipyridyl), partially disproportionates in aqueous solution to give Mn2+ and a higher valent species in equilibrium with 1. This equilibrium is buffer dependent and 1 is regenerated in quantitative yield in bpy buffer (pH = 4.5). 1 has previously been found to be in a pH-dependent equilibrium with the trinuclear species, [Mn3IV(O)4(bpy)4(H2O)2]4+ (2), in aqueous solution (Sarneski J. E.; Thorp H. H.; Brudvig G. W.; Crabtree R. H.; Schulte G. K., J. Am. Chem. Soc., 1990, 112, 7255). We now find that acidification of 1 yields an intermediate on a msec time scale, which in turn generates the final products, 2 and Mn2+, on a considerably slower time scale. The kinetics of these changes have been investigated by stopped-flow UV-Vis spectrophotometry. The rate of formation of the intermediate (k(obs) = 9.9 +/- 1.5 s-1 at 298 K, pH = 2.5, and 2 mM concentration of 1) is independent of added Mn2+ but shows a marked dependence on changes in the concentrations of 1, bpy or H+. The kinetics suggest that the rate-determining step is loss of bpy. This is supported by the observation that there is no effect of pH from pH 1.4-3.1 on the observed kinetics of an analogous complex, [Mn2III,IV(O)2(phen)4]3+, (3, phen = 1,10-phenanthroline). We propose that the opening of the bpy chelate initiates the conversion of 1 to 2 and, on the basis of these data, the intermediate is suggested to be [Mn2III,IV(O)2(bpy)3(H2O)2]3+. The slow conversion of the intermediate to 2 shows a second-order dependence on the concentration of 1 and is independent of added Mn2+. The second order rate constant for this reaction is 0.015 +/- 0.002 M-1 s-1 at 298 K, pH = 2.5. Also, there is an increase in this rate upon addition of an oxidant, (NH4)2Ce(IV)(NO3)6. Thus, we conclude that the rate-determining reaction of the slower step involves a redox reaction of two intermediate dimeric species.									29	0	0	0	0	0	29			1144-0546	1369-9261		WOS:A1994NR81600003

However, many current research efforts for high-efficiency FTS/CO2 reduction mainly focus on the metal-based catalysts, while metal-free and solar-driven photocatalysts are rarely explored. Here, by means of Lewis acid sites, a metal-free composite photocatalyst for CO reduction, namely boron (B) doped-graphene/g-C3N4 heterostructure, is proposed. First-principles calculations show that the dopants (B) as catalytic sites can effectively capture and activate CO molecules and reduce CO to CH3OH and CH4 in different doping content. It is worth noting that C2 products, i.e., C2H5OH, can be produced with low free energy barriers on paradoped graphene/g-C3N4. Meanwhile, the competitive hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) can be greatly suppressed, leading to the high selectivity of CO reduction. Moreover, the formation of a built-in electric field in heterostructure enhances the separation of photogenerated electrons and holes, which further accelerates the transmission of photogenerated electrons to the catalytic sites and improves the reaction efficiency. Overall, this work not only proposes a new strategy from a new perspective to solve problems of high energy consumption and low selectivity of FTS, but also provides a tandem strategy to solve problems of CO2 to multi-carbon products.(c) 2021 Science China Press.

Since 2011, single-atom catalysts (SACs) have been proven useful to solve this problem and have become a rapidly evolving research field. SACs allow the benefits from both homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysts to be combined in a single system, by providing isolated active sites, high selectivity, and ease of separation from reaction systems. Unfortunately, SACs suffer from the agglomeration of metal atoms during the fabrication and application processes for their high surface energy. Nevertheless, this problem can be solved by constructing strong coordination bonds between single-atoms and their supports, which can also significantly influence the activity and selectivity of SACs. In order to further identify and regulate the coordination environments of single-atoms, it is critical for the structural, physical, and chemical properties of SACs to be characterized downward to the atomic level. Hence, we first review different physical and chemical strategies used to stabilize the single-atom environments and clarify how the obtained coordination environments affect the catalytic performance of SACs. The reasonable selection of preparation methods can meet the specific requirements of central atoms and/or coordinated atoms, and effectively prevent the agglomeration of single-atoms. Moreover, we review the state-of-art complementary characterization methods (ex-situ and in-situ) to deepen the understanding of the critical structure & ndash;property relationship for SACs, which is essential to promote the rational design of SACs and other heterogeneous catalysts. Finally, we summarize several stages for the development of SACs and highlights challenges and prospects for the future of this field from the perspective of coordination environments. We believe that this review will provide new insights for future research on SACs to further improve both their activities and stabilities, reduce the associated preparation costs, and realize large-scale industrial applications.

The experimental investigation is carried out with air bubbles rising in a square column filled with water. Bubble size and shape are determined by means of a high-speed camera equipped with a telecentric lens. Gas volume fraction and bubble velocity are measured by using a dual-tip optical probe. The combination of these two techniques allows us to determine the interfacial area between the gas and the liquid. The transfer of oxygen from the bubbles to the water is measured from the time evolution of the concentration of oxygen dissolved in water, which is obtained by means of the gassing-out method. Concerning the bubble dynamics, the average vertical velocity is observed to decrease with alpha in agreement with previous experimental and numerical investigations, while the bubble agitation turns out to be weakly dependent on alpha. Concerning mass transfer, the Sherwood number is found to be very close to that of a single bubble rising at the same Reynolds number, provided the latter is based on the average vertical bubble velocity, which accounts for the effect of the gas volume fraction on the bubble rise velocity. This conclusion is valid for situations where the diffusion coefficient of the gas in the liquid is very low ( high Peclet number) and the dissolved gas is well mixed at the scale of the bubble. It is understood by considering that the transfer occurs at the front part of the bubbles through a diffusion layer which is very thin compared with all flow length scales and where the flow remains similar to that of a single rising bubble.									60	2	0	0	5	0	61			0022-1120	1469-7645		WOS:000351862000002

Inspired by remarkable accomplishments in enhancing the solar-to-hydrogen conversion efficiency, various efforts have aimed at fostering convenient and practical uses of PV electrolysis to make this technology ubiquitous, manageable, and efficient. Here, the design and function of a monolithic photoelectrolysis systema so-called artificial leaffor use in various environments are highlighted. The uniquely designed artificial-leaf system facilitates an unbiased water-splitting reaction by combining superstrate PV cells in series with single-face electrodes in a compact 2D catalytic configuration. Floatability is a new feature of the water-splitting artificial leaf; this feature maximizes solar light utilization and allows for easy retrieval for recycling. Additionally, its planar design enables operation of the device in water-scarce conditions. These characteristics endow the artificial leaf with versatility and a high adaptability to natural environments, widening the applicability of the device.									13	0	0	0	3	0	13			0935-9648	1521-4095		WOS:000409448300002	28714231

Carbon-supported SACs are the largest class because of the many excellent properties of carbon derivatives. The single metal atoms are usually immobilized by doped N atoms and in some cases by C geometrical defects on carbon materials. To explore the catalytic mechanisms and improve the catalytic performance, many efforts have been devoted to modulating the electronic structure of metal single atomic sites. Doping with polynary metals and heteroatoms has been recently proposed to be a simple and effective strategy, derived from the modulating mechanisms of metal alloy structure for metal catalysts and from the donating/withdrawing heteroatom doping for carbon supports, respectively. Polynary metals SACs involve two types of metal with atomical dispersion. The bimetal atom pairs act as dual catalytic sites leading to higher catalytic activity and selectivity. Polynary heteroatoms generally have two types of heteroatoms in which N always couples with another heteroatom, including B, S, P, etc. In this Review, the recent progress of polynary metals and heteroatoms SACs is summarized. Finally, the barriers to tune the activity/selectivity of SACs are discussed and further perspectives presented.									53	4	0	0	7	0	53			1613-6810	1613-6829		WOS:000530448500001	32363806	
J	Zhang, Wenqian; Xing, Pingxing; Zhang, Chunxiao; Zhang, Jiayu; Hu, Xin; Zhao, Leihong; He, Yiming								Facile synthesis of strontium molybdate coupled g-C3N4 composite for effective tetracycline and dyes degradation under visible light								ADVANCED POWDER TECHNOLOGY				33	5					103573	10.1016/j.apt.2022.103573				MAY 2022	2022	This work was designed to synthesize SrMoO4/g-C3N4 heterojunction for efficient degradation of tetracycline (TC) hydrochloride via photocatalysis. SrMoO4/g-C3N4 samples were prepared through a grinding and roasting process. The prepared nanocomposite exhibited excellent visible-light-driven photocatalytic activity. The reaction rate of TC photodegradation reaches 0.0171 min(-1), which is 5.9 times higher than that of neat g-C3N4. The origin of the high photoactivity of SrMoO4/g-C3N4 was investigated using a variety of characterization techniques including XRD, FT-IR, TG, SEM, TEM, XPS, DRS, Mott-Schottky, PL, PC, and EIS. Result showed that the added SrMoO4 was closely loaded on the g-C3N4 surface, which is conducive to the electron transfer between SrMoO4 and g-C3N4. Mott-Schottky analysis indicated that SrMoO4 has a lower conduction band (CB) position than g-C3N4. As a result, photogenerated electrons in g-C3N4 can move to the CB of SrMoO4 to hinder the recombination of charge carriers, thereby increasing the photocatalytic activity under visible light. The cycling test further suggested that the SrMoO4/g-C3N4 heterojunction has good stability in the photocatalytic degradation of TC. Super oxygen radicals and holes are the main reactive species.

In order to explore the details of growth and electrochemical decomposition of Li2O2, and its relationship with the cell performance, graphene films were used as model carbon electrodes and compared with electrodeposited Pd nanoparticles (NPs) on graphene. Multiple methods, including transmission/scanning electron microscopy (TEM/SEM), Raman spectroscopy, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), and coin cell charge/discharge test, were employed for material characterization and reaction monitoring. The results showed that the presence of Pd NPs significantly changed the growth, morphology, and crystal structure of Li2O2 and reduced the charge overpotential by 1060 mV. All of these changes are ascribed to the stronger binding energy between LiO2 and the Pd surface, resulting in the generation of amorphous Li2O2 with higher ionic conductivity of Li+ and O-2(2-), which in turn improve the cell charging performance.									39	0	0	0	4	0	39			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000382179400026	27459128

Nickel modified samples were characterized by XRD, SEM and nitrogen adsorption-desorption measurements. The incorporation of nickel into zeolite cavities led to the partial destruction of the zeolite framework. Modified zeolite was used as the electrode material for methanol oxidation in a deaerated 0.1 M NaOH aqueous solution. It showed similar electrochemical behavior to that of polycrystalline nickel. The destruction of zeolite structure probably enabled aluminum from the framework to stabilize alpha-Ni(OH)(2). Mixture of beta- and gamma-NiOOH was obtained at the 13XNi100 electrode after cycling in alkaline solution. It was concluded from the electrochemical measurements that beta-NiOOH was preferable oxide form for methanol oxidation. Copyright (C) 2011, Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC.

In this work, metal-free electrocatalysts using a single boron atom doped into a graphdiyne (GDY) monolayer are fabricated for N-2 fixation and conversion to NH3. The NRR electrochemical mechanism has been examined by density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Our calculations revealed that configuration B(S-3)@GDY fabricated using a single boron substituting the diacetylene carbon atom exhibits superior catalytic activity in the nitrogen reduction reaction. The preferred distal pathway of the NRR has an extremely low limiting potential of only 0.27 V. In addition, boron atom doping in GDY results in a small band gap (0.24 eV for B(S-3)@GDY) and redistribution of the electron density. The electron deficient boron atom is largely positively charged, and thus plays a crucial role in the activation of the N N bond. Moreover, the competing HER is effectively suppressed. This work provides an efficient metal-free single atom electrocatalyst for the NRR based on a 2D graphdiyne monolayer.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1463-9076	1463-9084		WOS:000838167900001	35946393

Exsolution kinetics are rapid in H-2-N-2 while those in CO-CO2 atmospheres are sluggish, possibly due to a combination of pO(2) difference in excess of three orders of magnitude as compared to that in H-2-N-2, and a different reaction pathway in the two atmospheres. NPs grown in H-2-N-2 exhibit a compositional and structural progression from an initially Ni-rich phase to an Fe-rich phase at short and long heat treatment durations, respectively. Once the subsurface Ni depletes, the NPs seem to coarsen via a combination of addition of Fe from the parent perovskite and Ostwald ripening. For longer heat treatment durations, CaO particles are observed to be appended to the Fe-Ni NPs. Exsolution also occurred in CO2-CO atmospheres exhibiting similar trends, although the composition of the NPs was Ni-rich even after a 25 h reduction treatment in 70 : 30 CO : CO2 at 800 degrees C, indicating that the NPs are resistant to coarsening and stable for use in highly reducing CO-CO2 environments. In reversible solid oxide cells (RSOC) applications, the CO oxidation kinetics are typically sluggish on single phase perovskite electrodes. However, for Fe-Ni alloy NP-decorated LCFCrN (Fe-Ni@LCFCrN), the NPs are shown to enhance the CO oxidation kinetics (by ca. 75%) and the CO2 reduction reaction (CO2-RR) kinetics (by ca. 15%) as compared to the parent material, LCFCr. This makes the Fe-Ni@LCFCrN catalyst equally active for both reactions, hence significantly enhancing its potential for use in reversible solid oxide cell applications.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000708030600001		
J	Wei, Ping; Yin, Shiheng; Zhou, Tao; Peng, Chao; Xu, Xiaolong; Lu, Juncai; Liu, Minchao; Jia, Jianbo; Zhang, Kun								Rational design of Z-scheme ZnFe2O4/Ag@Ag2CO3 hybrid with enhanced photocatalytic activity, stability and recovery performance for tetracycline degradation								SEPARATION AND PURIFICATION TECHNOLOGY				266						118544	10.1016/j.seppur.2021.118544		MAR 2021		JUL 1 2021	2021	The occurrence of pharmaceutical and personal care products (PPCPs) in the ambient environment has raised serious concerns. Herein, a dispersed ZnFe2O4 nanoparticle loaded Ag@Ag2CO3 nanorod hybrid (ZnFe2O4/Ag@Ag2CO3) was facile prepared, and used as a solar light driven photocatalyst for the degradation of tetracycline (TC), a typical PPCPs. The hybrids were characterized by XRD, SEM, EDS, HRTEM, DRS, PL, TRPL, M- H, BET, XPS, ESR and photoelectrochemical testing. The ZnFe2O4 was evenly dispersed on the surface of Ag@Ag2CO3 nanorods of which diameter was about 100 nm. The obtained ZnFe2O4/Ag@Ag2CO3 composites exhibited high TC degradation efficiency after 150 min Xe light illumination, which was much better than those of pure Ag@Ag2CO3 and ZnFe2O4. The photodegradation reaction rate constant (k) of the optimum ternary photocatalyst (ZnFe2O4 loading 5% wt) increased 4.04 times and 2.48 times than those of pure ZnFe2O4 and Ag2CO3@Ag, respectively. More importantly, the stability and recovery capacity of the ZnFe2O4/Ag@Ag2CO3 photocatalyst improved obviously than those of Ag@Ag2CO3. The reactive oxygen species (ROS) experiment indicated that center dot OH.h(+) and center dot O-2(-) involved in the photocatalytic reaction process, and the ROS contributes order was center dot O-2(-) > h(+) > center dot OH. The band positions of individual ZnFe2O4 and Ag 2CO3 were elucidated via DRUV-Vis spectra and Mott-Schottky plots. Based on the results of ROS experiment and band structure of ZnFe2O4 and Ag2CO3, it could be inferred that the photocatalytic reaction of ZnFe2O4/Ag@Ag2CO3 abided by Z-scheme mechanism, that is, Ag acted as the electronic bridge between Ag2CO3 and ZnFe2O4, and the center dot OH and center dot O-2(-) were formed on the valence band (VB) of Ag2CO3 and conduction band (CB) of ZnFe2O4, respectively, and then TC was further oxidized. The sufficient photocatalytic degradation of TC in ambient water revealed that a sunlightdriven ZnFe2O4/Ag@Ag2CO3 photocatalytic process may be efficiently applied for the remediation of PPCPs contaminated natural waters.									12	0	0	0	2	0	12			1383-5866	1873-3794		WOS:000643558000002		
J	Jonsson, AI; de Grandpre, J; Fomichev, VI; McConnell, JC; Beagley, SR				Jonsson, Andreas I/B-3887-2013	Jonsson, Andreas I/0000-0003-0321-6213			Doubled CO2-induced cooling in the middle atmosphere: Photochemical analysis of the ozone radiative feedback								JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES				109	D24					D24103	10.1029/2004JD005093				DEC 21 2004	2004	Simple radiative arguments predict that the impact of CO2 increases on the stratosphere and mesosphere should be a cooling and that the magnitude of the temperature change should be significantly larger than in the troposphere. Considering the temperature dependence of middle atmospheric gas-phase ozone photochemistry, it is expected that the ozone response will generate a radiative feedback that mitigates the CO2-induced cooling. The magnitude and vertical structure of this signal need to be characterised in order to distinguish the impact of future CO2 changes from other processes affecting the temperature evolution, such as changes in chlorine loading and water vapour trends. The Canadian Middle Atmosphere Model (CMAM) has been used in a process oriented study to examine the details of radiative and photochemical feedbacks under current and doubled CO2 conditions at low and middle latitudes. The model was run both with and without interactive chemistry in order to determine the importance of the radiative feedback through ozone changes on the CO2-induced cooling signal. Changes in other greenhouse gases, ozone depleting substances, or SST's and sea ice coverage were not considered. The interactive model results show a substantial temperature decrease throughout most of the middle atmosphere with a maximum cooling of 10-12 K at the stratopause. In association with this temperature change, the ozone mixing ratio increases by 15-20% in the upper stratosphere and by 10-15% in the lower mesosphere. Results from the non-interactive simulations show that the magnitude of the cooling is overestimated by up to similar to4.5 K when the ozone radiative feedback is not considered. In spite of the complexity of the ozone chemistry, the ozone increase at 30-70 km can be understood primarily as a result of the negative temperature dependence of the O+O-2+M-->O-3+M reaction that controls odd oxygen partitioning. Additional partial contributions to the ozone increase below 60 km are provided by a decrease in the reaction rate coefficient of the Chapman reaction O+O-3-->2O(2) and by a decrease in the NO2 abundance.									88	1	1	0	2	0	89			2169-897X	2169-8996		WOS:000226026800005

The structure-activity of the Ni-MOFs with different morphologies, nanowires, neurons, and urchins is systemically investigated. The Ni-MOFs were controllably synthesized via the facile solvothermal method. Among them, the Ni-MOF nanowires are endowed with the highest electrocatalytic activity due to the unique structure, more exposed active sites, lower charge transfer resistance, and the fast and direct electron transfer in 1D structures. The typical morphology of the Ni-MOF nanowires is ca. 10 nm in diameter and several micrometers in length. When employed as an electrocatalyst in urea oxidation reaction, it exhibits a lower overpotential than and superior stability to the NiMOFs with other morphologies. Ni-MOF nanowires require a potential of similar to 0.80 V (vs Ag/AgCl) to obtain 160 mA cm(-2). In addition, after continuous electrocatalyzing for 3600 s at 0.40 V (vs Ag/AgCl), the current density retention of Ni-MOF nanowires could still reach more than 60% (>12 mA cm(-2)), which demonstrates Ni-MOF nanowires as promising electrocatalysts for urea oxidation.									30	1	0	0	2	0	30			0020-1669	1520-510X		WOS:000484066500020	31397562

We report chemical and stable isotopic data from a study monitoring the biogeochemical processes involved in the generation of mine waters and their remediation by two RAPS. Sulfur isotopes show that sulfate in all mine waters has a common source (pyrite oxidation), whilst oxygen isotopes show that oxidation of pyritic sulfur is mediated by Fe(III)(aq). The isotopic composition of dissolved sulfide, combined with the sulfur and oxygen isotopic composition of sulfate in RAPS effluents, proves BSR and details its dual isotope systematics. The occurrence and isotopic composition of solid phase iron sulfides indicate the removal of reduced sulfur within the RAPS, with significant amounts of elemental sulfur indicating reoxidation steps. However, only 0 to 9% of solid phase iron occurs as Fe sulfides, with approximately 70% of the removed iron occurs as Fe(III) (hydr)oxides. Some of the (hydr)oxide is supplied to the wetland as solids and is simply filtered by the wetland substrate, playing no role in alkalinity generation or proton removal. However, the majority of iron is supplied as dissolved Fe(II), indicating that acid generating oxidation and hydrolysis reactions dominate iron removal. The overall contribution of BSR to the sulfur geochemistry in the RAPS is limited and sulfate retention is dominated by sulfate precipitation, comparable to aerobic treatment systems, and show that the proton acidity resulting from iron oxidation and hydrolysis must be subsequently neutralised by calcite dissolution and/or BSR deeper in the RAPS sediments. BSR is not as important as previously thought for metal removal in RAPS. The results have practical consequences for the design, treatment performance and long-term functionality of such systems.

The enzyme from Chromatium vinosum was used. In particular the reactions of active enzyme with H-2 and CO were monitored. The conversion from fully reduced, active hydrogenase (Ni-a-SR state) to the Ni-a-C* state was completed in less than 8 ms, a rate consistent with the H-2-evolution activity of the enzyme. The reaction of CO with fully reduced enzyme was followed from 8 to 200 ms. The Ni-a-SR state did not react with CO. It was discovered, contrary to expectations, that the Ni-a-C* state did not react with CO when reactions were performed in the dark. When H-2 was replaced by CO, a Ni-a-C* EPR signal appeared within 11 ms; this was also the case when H-2 was replaced by Ar. With CO, however, the Ni-a-C* state decayed within 40 ms, due to the generation of the Ni-a-S . CO state (the EPR-silent state of the enzyme with bound CO). The Ni-a-C* state, induced after 11 ms by replacing H-2 by CO in the dark, could be converted, in the frozen enzyme, into the EPR-detectable state with CO bound to nickel (Ni-a*. CO) by illumination at 30 K (evoking the Ni-a-L* state), followed by dark adaptation at 200 K. This can be explained by assuming that the Ni-a-C* state represents a formally trivalent state of nickel, which is unable to bind CO, whereas nickel in the Ni-a-L* and the Ni-a*. CO states is formally monovalent.									62	0	0	0	32	0	63			0014-2956			WOS:000078737000007	10092843

The genome-wide identification of GSTs in T. japonicus and P. nana resulted in 32 and 20 GSTs in total, respectively. Among the identified GSTs, two specific classes of GSTs, specifically sigma and delta/epsilon GSTs were the dominant form of cyto-solic GSTs in T. japonicus, while delta/epsilon and mu classes were dominant cytosolic GSTs in P. nana. In addition, Membrane-Associated Proteins in Eicosanoid and Glutathione metabolism (MAPEG) family were found in relatively higher proportion compared to other classes. Moreover, sigma, delta/epsilon, and microsomal GSTs have shown to expand through tandem duplication. To validate the detoxification function of the identified GSTs, both copepods were exposed to copper (Cu2+) and the reactive oxygen species (ROS) level and GST activity were measured. With integration of phylogenetic analysis and xenobiotic-mediated GST mRNA expression patterns along with previous enzymatic activities, the functional divergence among species-specific GST genes was clearly observed. This study covers full identification of GST classes in two marine copepod species and their important role in marine environmental ecotoxicology.									25	0	0	0	23	0	25			0166-445X	1879-1514		WOS:000462420600007	30735907

Here we report a facile one-pot solvothermal method to synthesize Rh/WO3-x hybrid nanowires. Ultra-small Rh nanoparticles with an average size of similar to 1.7 nm were tightly anchored on WO3-x nanowires. Rh/WO3-x catalysts exhibited substantially enhanced activity for hydrolytic dehydrogenation of AB under both dark and visible light irradiation conditions relative to mixed Rh nanoparticles and WO3-x nanowires (Rh + WO3-x), and Rh/C and WO3-x nanowires. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis indicated that the synergistic effect between Rh nanoparticles and WO3-x nanowires was responsible for such an enhancement in activity. Specifically, Rh/WO3-x achieved the highest turnover frequency (TOF) with a value of 805.0 mol(H2) mol(Rh)(-1) min(-1) at room temperature under visible light irradiation. The H-2 release rate as a function of reaction time exhibited a volcano plot under visible light irradiation, indicating that a self-activation process occurred in the hydrolytic dehydrogenation of AB due to additional oxygen vacancies arising from in situ reduction of WO3-x nanowires by AB, and thus an enhanced localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR). Such a self-activation process was responsible for the enhanced catalytic activity under visible light irradiation relative to that under dark conditions, which was supported by the lower activation energy (45.2 vs. 50.5 kJ mol(-1)). In addition, Rh/WO3-x catalysts were relatively stable with only little loss in activity after five cycles due to the tight attachment between two components.									17	1	0	0	0	0	18			2516-0230			WOS:000492772600011	36132115

To protect against the cytotoxic ROS, it is important for pathogenic bacteria to inactivate ROS by employing their antioxidant enzymes like superoxide dismutase (SOD). Here, we cloned and characterized the sodA gene from the plant pathogenic bacterium, 'Candidatus Phytoplasma asteris' OY-W strain. This is the first description of gene expression and antioxidant enzymatic activity of SOD from a phytoplasma. We also demonstrated the sodA gene product (OY-SOD) functions as Mn-type SOD. Since other Mollicutes bacteria such as mycoplasmas do not possess sodA probably due to reductive evolution, it is intriguing that phytoplasmas possess sodA despite their lack of many metabolic genes, suggesting that OY-SOD may play an important role in the phytoplasma colonization of plants and insects. Moreover, Western blot analysis and real-time PCR revealed that OY-SOD is expressed when the phytoplasma is grown in both plant and insect hosts, suggesting it is functioning in both hosts. Possible role of SOD in protection against damage by host-derived ROS is discussed. (C) 2012 Published by Elsevier B.V.									17	1	0	0	17	0	20			0378-1119	1879-0038		WOS:000311069300003	22982017	
J	Kim, Tae Sung; Holappa, Lauri; Park, Joo Hyun								Influence of calcium aluminate flux on reoxidation behaviour of molten steel during continuous casting process								IRONMAKING & STEELMAKING				47	1	SI		84	92		10.1080/03019233.2019.1687968		NOV 2019		JAN 2 2020	2020	It is an important issue to prevent molten steel in tundish from being reoxidized during the continuous casting process for improving the cleanliness of steel products. Rice husk ash (RHA) is an excellent insulation powder to prevent heat loss of the molten steel in the tundish. The addition of RHA increases the silica activity in the molten slag layer, which can cause reoxidation of molten steel. Therefore, the effect of calcium aluminate-based flux (CA-flux) on reoxidation behaviour was investigated with different ratios of CA-flux to RHA + CA-flux (=RCA). The silicon and oxygen pick-up, which is caused by the self-dissociation of silica at the slag/metal interface was suppressed with an increasing RCA, and hence the number of inclusions formed by reoxidation in the molten steel was reduced at high RCA. The evolution of inclusions with different RCA was investigated by comparing experimental results with predictions from a refractory-slag-metal-inclusion (ReSMI) multiphase reaction simulation. Finally, the inclusion formation behaviour in tundish was investigated using a ReSMI simulation with different RCA and including the temperature drop of the steel melts in the ladle during casting.									8	2	0	0	0	0	9			0301-9233	1743-2812		WOS:000497351900001

Here we review the models that have been proposed to interpret these signals in relation to the thermodynamics and kinetics of interfacial and intramolecular electron transfer and active site chemistry. We list the corresponding equations in forms that are ready to use for fitting, and the commands that run these fits in the open source software QSoas. We relate these models to those that have been used for characterizing small synthetic redox catalysts diffusing in solution.									48	0	0	0	12	0	48			2451-9103			WOS:000424673700020

A hypothesis that the composite IrOx/Nafion anode catalyst layer causes two of these arcs with a constant sum of resistance and current constrictions cause the third arc, is suggested. This hypothesis implies that the total differential cell resistance at current densities above 0.35 A cm(-2) is purely ascribed to protonic resistance in Nafion in this type of PEMEC.

This has allowed the study of the degradation of this compound from 25 to 150 degreesC with an accurate step in time adapted to the very fast oxidation kinetic (2 mum of oxide layer per day at room temperature). From these experiments the activation energy (E-a) of the mechanism has been determined by the way of an original approach consisting in the analysis of the temperature dependent evolution of the integrated intensity of a selected ZrAu diffraction peak. Furthermore, this activation energy has been compared with the one obtained from thermogravimetric analysis. The two independent techniques giving consistent information, average activation energy of 55 kJ mol(-1) was associated with this unusual phenomenon. We have shown that no significant oxidation behavior is observed under pure oxygen below 100degreesC. The study of the phenomenon under pure oxygen, the microstructural analysis of the oxide layer and the study of the influence of relative humidity (RH) on the oxidation rate, allows us to attribute the oxidation mechanism to an atmospheric oxidation mechanism controlled by the dissociation of gaseous oxidative species at the alloy/air interface.

It is then applied to study the temporal behavior of the discharge plasma parameters such as electron density, the neutral and ion composition, the ionization fraction of the sputtered vapor, the oxygen dissociation fraction, and the composition of the discharge current. We study and compare the discharge properties when the discharge is operated in the two well established operating modes, the metal mode and the poisoned mode. Experimentally, it is found that in the metal mode the discharge current waveform displays a typical non-reactive evolution, while in the poisoned mode the discharge current waveform becomes distinctly triangular and the current increases significantly. Using the R-IRM we explore the current increase and find that when the discharge is operated in the metal mode Ar+ and Ti+ -ions contribute most significantly (roughly equal amounts) to the discharge current while in the poisoned mode the Ar+ -ions contribute most significantly to the discharge current and the contribution of O+ -ions, Ti+ -ions, and secondary electron emission is much smaller. Furthermore, we find that recycling of atoms coming from the target, that are subsequently ionized, is required for the current generation in both modes of operation. From the R-IRM results it is found that in the metal mode self-sputter recycling dominates and in the poisoned mode working gas recycling dominates. We also show that working gas recycling can lead to very high discharge currents but never to a runaway. It is concluded that the dominating type of recycling determines the discharge current waveform.									73	1	0	0	0	0	74			0963-0252	1361-6595		WOS:000385932500001

The O-2-releasing potential of prepared samples was evaluated at 1500 degrees C for a two-step water splitting process. The partially oxygen defected CeO2-MO1.5 (M = Sc3+, Y3+ or Dy3+) mixed oxide exhibited an enhancement of the O-2 evolution on CeO2-ScO1.5 owing to the crystal-chemical effect that cation with smaller ionic radius (Sc3+) compensates the volume expansion of crystal lattice resulted in the reduction of Ce4+ with smaller ionic radius into Ce3+ with larger ionic radius. The CeO2-MO2 (M = Zr4+ and Hf4+) produced larger amount of O-2 than that for CeO2-MO1.5 mixed oxides, since CeO2-MO2 has no oxygen vacancy initially. While the ionic radii of Zr4+ and Hf4+ are almost equal, the higher O-2-releasing reactivity of Ce0.9Hf0.1O2 than that of Ce0.9Zr0.1O2 is explained in terms of ionicity of M-O bond. Also, the weight losses of CeO2, Ce0.9Zr0.1O2 and Ce0.9Hf0.1O2 in the mitigation process from high Po-2(O-2 gas stream) to low Po-2 (Ar gas stream) atmosphere were determined. The quasi activation energies in the initial period of the O-2-release for CeO2, Ce0.9Zr0.1O2 and Ce0.9Hf0.1O2 were evaluated 105, 84.2 and 75.0 kJ/mol, respectively. The O-2-releasing reactivity is considered from the standpoint of an activation energy. Copyright (C) 2014, Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

J	Miqyass, Mohamed; Marosvolgyi, Marcell A.; Nagel, Zachary; Yocum, Charles F.; van Gorkom, Hans J.								S-state dependence of the calcium requirement and binding characteristics in the oxygen-evolving complex of photosystem II								BIOCHEMISTRY				47	30			7915	7924		10.1021/bi8006059				JUL 29 2008	2008	The functional role of the Call ion in the oxygen-evolving complex of photosystem II is not yet clear. Current models explain why the redox cycle of the complex would be interrupted after the S-3 state without Call, but the literature shows that it is interrupted after the S-2 state. Reinterpretation of the literature on methods of Call depletion [Miqyass, M., van Gorkom, H. J., and Yocum, C. F. (2007) Photosynth. Res. 92, 275-287] led us to propose that all S-state transit I ions require Call. Here we confirm that interpretation by measurements of flash-induced S-state transitions in UV absorbance. The results are explained by a cation exchange at the Call binding site that, in the absence of the extrinsic PsbP and PsbQ polypeptides, can occur in minutes in low S-states and in seconds in high S-states, depending on the concentration of the substituting cation. In the S-2(K+) or S-2(Na+) state a slow conformational change occurs that prevents recovery of the slow-exchange situation on return to a lower S-state but does not inhibit the S-state cycle in the presence of Ca2+. The ratio of binding affinities for monovalent vs divalent cations increases dramatically in the higher S-states. With the possible exception of S-0 to S-1, all S-state transitions specifically require Call, suggesting that Ca2+-bound H2O plays an essential role in a H+ transfer network required for H+-coupled electron transfer from the Mn cluster to tyrosine Z.									26	0	0	0	13	0	26			0006-2960			WOS:000257860100017	18593200

The structure of these different films is analyzed by different techniques, such as Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy, Rutherford backscattering spectrometry, atomic force microscopy, ellipsometry, and contact angle measurements. Results of the film composition (at least 30% carbon content), optical properties, and morphology indicate a low cross-linking degree accompanied by short chain length for RFICP and DECRP films, in contrast to a high-molecular-weight structure observed for the MIRA film. Carbon removal is achieved within the same plasma reactors by further oxygen-containing plasma treatment per-formed in the RF-ICP (3.33 Pa), DECRP (0.27 Pa, -200 V biased substrate), and MIRA (N-2/O-2 (98.7:1.3, 560 Pa)) reactors. The same measurements are carried out on the treated samples in order to detect the main changes in film composition, optical properties, and morphology. The evolution of surface energy is also studied. The results are discussed according to film structure and process specificity.					14th Biannual International Summer School on Vacuum, Electron and Ion Technologies14th Biannual International Summer School on Vacuum, Electron and Ion Technologies	SEP 12-16, 2005SEP 12-16, 2005		Burgas, BULGARIABurgas, BULGARIA	50	0	0	0	1	1	50			1612-8850	1612-8869		WOS:000235628300002
