J	Ohkuma, Hirokazu; Uechi, Ichiro; Imanishi, Nobuyuki; Hirano, Atsushi; Takeda, Yasuo; Yamamoto, Osamu								Carbon electrode with perovskite-oxide catalyst for aqueous electrolyte lithium-air secondary batteries								JOURNAL OF POWER SOURCES				223				319	324		10.1016/j.jpowsour.2012.09.028				FEB 1 2013	2013	Carbon electrodes with perovskite-type oxide catalysts were investigated as air electrodes for aqueous lithium-air secondary batteries. The system consisted of a water-stable lithium electrode, an aqueous solution of saturated LiOH with 10 M LiCl as electrolyte, and a carbon black air electrode with perovskite catalyst additive. The stability, oxygen reduction and oxygen evolution catalytic activity of the La0.6Ca0.4Co0.8Fe0.2O3, La0.8Sr0.2Fe0.8Mn0.2O3, and La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3 perovskite-type oxides were examined in the LiOH-LiCl electrolyte. The perovskite-type oxides were stable in this solution and the oxygen reduction and evolution overpotential on the carbon black substrate was decreased by addition of these perovskite-type oxides. No chlorine evolution was observed during the oxidation reaction on carbon black with the perovskite-type oxides in the LiOH-LiCl electrolyte. The results indicate that carbon black with perovskite-type oxide additives is a potential candidate for the air electrode in the aqueous electrolyte lithium-air rechargeable batteries.

However, there are two main challenges for most perovskite oxides to be efficient in OER, namely less active sites and low electrical conductivity, leading to limited catalytic performance. To overcome these intrinsic obstacles, various strategies are developed to enhance their catalytic activities in OER. In this review, the recent developments of these strategies is comprehensively summarized and systematically discussed, including composition engineering, crystal facet control, morphology modulation, defect engineering, and hybridization. Finally, perspectives on the design of perovskite oxide-based electrocatalysts for practical applications in OER are given.									20	0	0	0	3	0	19			1613-6810	1613-6829		WOS:000678822200001	34310054

In this study, a doping-etching route has been developed to access defect rich Fe-Co-Al (Fe-Co-Al-AE) ternary hydroxide nanosheets for superior electrochemical oxygen evolution. After partial etching of Al, ultrathin Fe3Co2Al2-AE electrocatalysts with a rich pore structure are obtained with a shift of the cobalt valence state towards higher valence (Co2+-> Co3+), along with a substantial improvement in the catalytic performance. Fe3Co2Al2-AE shows a notably lower overpotential of only 284 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) and double the OER mass activity of the etching-free Fe3Co2Al2 with an overpotential of 350 mV. Density functional theory shows the leaching of Al changes the rate-determining step of the OER from conversion of *OOH into O-2 on Fe3Co2Al2 to formation of OOH from *O on the Al-defective catalysts. This work demonstrates an effective route to design and synthesize transition metal electrocatalysts and provides a promising alternative for the further development of oxygen evolution catalysts.									21	2	0	0	1	0	21			1864-5631	1864-564X		WOS:000478761200008	31017344

The nanoparticles are then applied as electrocatalysts for oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Compared to unary Ni or Fe, the binary NiFe alloy electrocatalyst exhibits a much lower overpotential of 298 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2), and it exhibits electrocatalytic activity for OER superior to that of state-of-the-art RuO2 and IrO2 noble metal oxide catalysts. Moreover, the alloy catalyst exhibits substantial longterm durability after 1000 cyclic voltammetry tests. This remarkable electrochemical performance mainly originates from the synergistic effects of Fe incorporation into Ni species, leading to the improved charge transfer kinetics and intrinsic activity of the catalyst. These results provide a promising avenue for developing cost-effective and high-performance electrocatalysts as advanced electrodes for energy storage and conversion systems.									31	2	0	0	0	0	31			0920-5861	1873-4308		WOS:000535914800004

Here, a new strategy was developed to synthesize nonsupported ultrasmall cobalt oxide nanocubanes through an in situ phase transformation mechanism using a layered Co(OH)(OCH3) precursor. Under sonication, the precursor was exfoliated and transformed into cobalt oxide nanocubanes in the presence of NaHCO3-Na2SiF6 buffer solution. The resulting cobalt catalyst with an average particle size less than 2 nm exhibited a turnover frequency of 0.023 per second per cobalt in photocatalytic water oxidation. X-ray absorption results suggested a unique nanocubane structure, where 13 cobalt atoms fully coordinated with oxygen in an octahedral arrangement to form 8 Co4O4 cubanes, which may be responsible for the exceptionally high OER activity.									182	10	0	0	20	0	183			0002-7863			WOS:000352244800038	25759959

Given ample access to seawater and scarce freshwater resources, such regions make the direct and selective electrolytic splitting of seawater into molecular hydrogen and oxygen a potentially attractive technology. The key catalytic challenge consists of the competition between anodic chlorine chemistry and the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). This Perspective addresses some aspects related to direct seawater electrolyzers equipped with selective OER and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) electrocatalysts. Starting from a historical background to the most recent achievements, it will provide insights into the current state and future perspectives of the topic. This Perspective also addresses prospects of the combination of direct seawater electrolysis with hydrogen fuel cell technology (reversible seawater electrolysis) and discusses its suitability as combined energy conversion-freshwater production technology.									251	10	0	0	12	0	256			2380-8195			WOS:000464889300020

The obtained materials reveal record-high electrocatalyst mass activities of approximate to 2.90 kA g(-1) at an overpotential of 300 mV in 0.1 m KOH, superior to the benchmarking precious and nonprecious metal electrocatalysts. This property is assigned to the particular in situ self-reconstruction and self-activation of the SURMOFs during the immersion and the electrochemical treatment in alkaline aqueous electrolytes, which allows for the generation of NiFe (oxy)hydroxide electrocatalyst materials of specific morphology and microstructure.									12	0	0	0	1	0	12			0935-9648	1521-4095		WOS:000679847600001	34337809

We report a hollow WC electrocatalyst obtained through a scalable strategy which is a combination of spray drying method with a subsequent gas-solid carburization reaction by using ammonium metatungstate (AMT) as the precursor. The as-prepared hollow structured WC catalyst has an improved BET surface area and a pore volume in comparison with the normal bulky WC (B-WC) catalyst synthesized using the same procedure but without the spray drying treatment for the precursor, which provides the hollow WC (H-WC) electrode a highly efficient catalytic structure to drive the electrocatalytic reactions such as HER. The attractive catalytic activity of this materials is that it can catalyze the HER over a wide pH range. And the comprehensive electrochemical characterization show the H-WC superstructure has the promising potential to be well coupled with many pH-dependent oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrocatalysts in acid, neutral, and alkaline electrolytes for an overall water splitting reaction to generate hydrogen and oxygen.

Multi-metallic materials with two-dimensional (2D) morphology and amorphous structure may be very prospective electrocatalysts, which deserve to be highly explored. In this work, we propose a solid-phase grinding method to skillfully synthesize amorphous FeCoNi ternary hydroxides nanosheets using 2-methylimidazole as inducer to provide hydroxyl (OH-). This reaction is simple and rapid without additional solvents or large mechanical forces. The prepared FeCoNi nanosheet (called FeCoNi-NS) loaded on Ni foam exhibits superior OER activity with a low overpotential of 262mV at the current density of 10 mA.cm(-2) and a small Tafel slope of 39.4mV.dec(-1).

As one of the most promising electrochemical energy conversion and storage devices, the Zn-air battery has attracted extensive research in recent years due to the advantages of abundant resources, low price, high energy density, and high reduction potential. However, the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) of Zn-air battery during discharge and charge have complicated multi-electron transfer processes with slow reaction kinetics. It is important to develop efficient and stable oxygen electrocatalysts. At present, single-function catalysts such as Pt/C, RuO2, and IrO2 are regarded as the benchmark catalysts for ORR and OER, respectively. However, the large-scale application of Zn-air battery is limited by the few sources of the precious metal catalysts, as well as their high costs, and poor long-term stability. Therefore, designing bifunctional electrocatalysts with excellent activity and stability using resource-rich non-noble metals is the key to improving ORR/OER reaction kinetics and promoting the commercial application of the Zn-air battery. Metal-organic framework (MOF) is a kind of porous crystal material composed of metal ions/clusters connected by organic ligands, which has the characteristics of adjustable porosity, highly ordered pore structure, low crystal density, and large specific surface area. MOFs and their derivatives show remarkable performance in promoting oxygen reaction, and are a promising candidate material for oxygen electrocatalysts. Herein, this review summarizes the latest progress in advanced MOF-derived materials such as oxygen electrocatalysts in a Zn-air battery. Firstly, the composition and working principle of the Zn-air battery are introduced. Then, the related reaction mechanism of ORR/OER is briefly described. After that, the latest developments in ORR/OER electrocatalysts for Zn-air batteries are introduced in detail from two aspects: (i) non-precious metal catalysts (NPMC) derived from MOF materials, including single transition metals and bimetallic catalysts with Co, Fe, Mn, Cu, etc.; (ii) metal-free catalysts derived from MOF materials, including heteroatom-doped MOF materials and MOF/graphene oxide (GO) composite materials. At the end of the paper, we also put forward the challenges and prospects of designing bifunctional oxygen electrocatalysts with high activity and stability derived from MOF materials for Zn-air battery.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0				1996-1944		WOS:000851818700001	36079218

The rich catalytic site of transition metals and the excellent conductivity of carbon material make these materials as a hopeful electrocatalyst in OER. Carbon-incorporated LaFe0.8Co0.2O3 was prepared by a simple solution combustion method for the development of the best performance of the electrocatalyst. The catalyst can deliver 10 mA/cm(2) current density at an overpotential of 410 mV with better catalytic stability. The introduction of carbon material improves the dispersion ability of the catalyst and the electrical conductivity.

Constructing a perovskite oxide/carbon composite with intimate interaction at the interface is of great importance for conductivity and bifunctional oxygen activities. In this work, combining "exsolution effect" of perovskite oxide at high temperature and reducing atmosphere, carbon nano -tubes (CNTs) are in-situ synthesized on the surface of a La0.8Sr1.2Fe0.5Ni0.5O4+d (LSFN) perovskite oxide with K2NiF4 structure via a simple chemical vapor deposition (CVD) method. Physical characterizations show that CNTs are twining around the surface of LSFN particles with strong interaction. Under the function of synergistic effect between LSFN and CNTs, more mobile oxygen species, improved surface electronic structure and opti-mized charge distribution and transformation are obtained. Finally, the as-prepared LSFN@CNTs composites exhibit superior oxygen electrocatalytic performances in alka-line solution, with an ORR overpotential of 761 mV at-1.0 mA cm-2, a small OER over -potential of 314 mV at 10 mA cm-2 and an enhanced cycling stability of >3000 cycles, which outperforms commercial IrO2 catalyst and published perovskite oxide based bifunctional oxygen catalysts.(c) 2022 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC.

Developing an effective bifunctional catalyst with abundant highly active sites and full exposure to reactants is strongly considered. Herein a nitrogen-doped mesoporous graphene framework (NMGF) was proposed with intrinsic N/O heteroatoms and abundant topological defects for metal-free ORR/OER. The NMGF was fabricated by direct chemical vapor deposition on MgO template. The as obtained NMGF exhibited high porosity with a large specific surface area of 1440 m(2) g(-1) as well as a high electrical conductivity of 57.0s cm(-1). This unique structure is demonstrated to possess several advantages, including plentiful active centers due to defects and heteroatoms, improved utilization efficiency by very high electrochemically active surface area and hydrophilic surface, facilitated ion diffusion through interconnected pores and smooth electron transportation in the highly conductive 3D framework, thereby leading to superior ORR and OER bifunctional activity. The ORR half-wave potential was 0.714 V, and the potential to reach 10.0 mA cm(-2) OER current density was 1.664 V with the potential gap of 0.95 V.

J	Ma, Xiu-Xiu; Dai, Xu-Hong; He, Xing-Quan								Co9S8-Modified N, S, and P Ternary-Doped 3D Graphene Aerogels as a High-Performance Electrocatalyst for Both the Oxygen Reduction Reaction and Oxygen Evolution Reaction								ACS SUSTAINABLE CHEMISTRY & ENGINEERING				5	11			9848	9857		10.1021/acssuschemeng.7b01820				NOV 2017	2017	Efficient and robust electrocatalysts for both the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) play key roles in energy conversion and storage devices. In this work, we construct a bifunctional catalyst by homogeneously dispersing Co9S8 nanoparticles on a nitrogen (N), sulfur (S), and phosphate (P) ternary-doped 3D graphene aerogel (NSPG) matrix via a facile pyrolysis method. Because of the N, S, and P ternary-doping effects, abundant defects and channels are produced in the edge of graphene, resulting in a high specific BET surface area (S-BET) of 657 m(2) g(-1). With the incorporation of Co9S8 nanocrystals into NSPG, the produced catalyst (Co9S8/NSPG-900) possesses an S-BET of 478 m(2) g(-1) with porous characteristics. The synergy of structure and composition features enables fast electrochemical kinetics of the catalyst, leading to efficient ORR activity with a half-wave potential of 0.800 V versus the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE), a limiting current density of 7.26 mA cm(-2), high stability and CH3OH tolerance, a high OER performance with an overpotential of 343 mV at the current density of 10 mA cm(-2), and excellent long-term stability. As a bifunctional catalyst for both the ORR and OER, it delivers a potential gap of 820 mV, comparable to state-of-the-art bifunctional catalysts.									50	3	0	0	2	0	51			2168-0485			WOS:000414825900040

It was prepared via facile two-step hydrothermal reactions. Compared with Co3O4, NiMn-LDH and traditional RuO2 electrocatalysts, the as-prepared Co3O4@NiMn-LDH/NF presents better electrocatalytic oxygen evolution performance, achieving a low overpotential of 282 mV at 50 mA.cm(-2) with a Tafel slope of 64 mV.dec(-1) in 1 mol.L-1 KOH solution. Through designing effective interface engineering, the Co3O4@ NiMn-LDH/NF combines synergistically the excellent electrocatalytic activity of Co3O4 and NiMn-LDH. The Co3O4 nanowire array based on Ni foam as a core structure with abundant void spaces not only exposes more active sites, but also ensures easy diffusion of electrolyte and fast release of gas products. And the NiMn-LDH nanosheets on the Co3O4 nanowire array provide rich hydrophilic groups and active sites for easy access of water molecules, thus facilitating efficient oxygen evolution reaction.									2	3	0	0	0	0	3			1001-4861			WOS:000580595900010

Remarkable features of the porous carbon structure, N/Co-doping effect, introduction of NRGO, and good contact between N/Co-doped PCP and NRGO result in a high catalytic efficiency. The hybrid shows excellent electrocatalytic activities and kinetics for oxygen reduction reaction in basic media, which compares favorably with those of the Pt/C catalyst, together with superior durability, a four-electron pathway, and excellent methanol tolerance. The hybrid also exhibits superior performance for hydrogen evolution reaction, offering a low onset overpotential of 58 mV and a stable current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at 229 mV in acid media, as well as good catalytic performance for oxygen evolution reaction (a small overpotential of 1.66 V for 10 mA cm(-2) current density). The dual-active-site mechanism originating from synergic effects between N/Co-doped PCP and NRGO is responsible for the excellent performance of the hybrid. This development offers an attractive catalyst material for large-scale fuel cells and water splitting technologies.									634	32	0	0	30	0	638			1616-301X	1616-3028		WOS:000349629600006

Herein, confined defects in atomically-thin BiOCl nanosheets were created to serve as a remarkable platform to explore the relationship between defects and photocatalytic activity. Surface defects can be clearly observed on atomically-thin BiOCl nanosheets from scanning transmission electron microscopy images. Theoretical/experimental results suggest that defect engineering increased states of density and narrowed the band gap. With combined effects from defect induced shortened hole migratory paths and creation of coordination-unsaturated active atoms with dangling bonds, defect-rich BiOCl nanosheets displayed 3 and 8 times higher photocatalytic activity towards oxygen evolution compared with atomically-thin BiOCl nanosheets and bulk BiOCl, respectively. This successful application of defect engineering will pave a new pathway for improving photocatalytic oxygen evolution activity of other materials.									80	3	0	0	7	1	80			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000405190000026

However, the development of a low-cost easy-prepared OER electrocatalyst with high mass activity and rapid kinetics is still challenging. Herein, we report the facile deposition of tannin-NiFe (TANF) complex film on carbon fiber paper (CP) as a highly efficient OER electrocatalyst. TANF gives rapid OER reaction kinetics with a very small Tafel slope of 28 mV dec(-1). The mass activity of TANF reaches 9.17 x 10(3) Ag-1 at an overpotential of 300 mV, which is nearly 200-times larger than that of NiFe double layered hydroxide. Furthermore, tannic acid in TANF can be electrochemically extracted under anodic potential, leaving the inorganic composite NixFe1-xOyHz as the OER-active species. This work may provide a guide to probing the electrochemical transformation and investigating the reactive species of other metal-organic complexes as heterogeneous electrocatalysts.									140	3	0	0	9	0	140			1433-7851	1521-3773		WOS:000462680700012	30549367

Herein, we report the facile synthesis of hierarchical NiCo2O4 (NCO) hollow nanospheres via a hard template method and following heat treatment. The synthesized hollow NCO consists of ultrathin nanosheets, which could provide larger specific surface area, more active sites and easy access channels for oxygen and electrolyte transport. The electrochemical studies reveal that the NCO hollow owns excellent ORR and OER catalytic activities, characterized with lower onset potential, higher diffusion limiting current density. Moreover, the NCO hollow shows superior stability compared to that of NCO urchin, PVC and RuO2 for ORR and OER, respectively. The excellent electrocatalytic activities, long-term stability for both the ORR and OER and the facile synthesis procedure make the NCO hollow a potential promising bi-functional catalyst for the metal-air batteries and fuel cells.

Herein, we report a strategy to synthesize porous Co3FeNx/N-doped carbon nanoleaf arrays supported by carbon cloth (Co3FeNx/NC LACC) via a postsynthetic ligand exchange reaction of metalorganic-framework (MOF, ZIF-67) at room temperature followed by a facile nitridation process. This synthesis approach is beneficial to the formation of porous hierarchical structure with abundant heterointerfaces, which could increase the exposed active sites and accelerate the charge/mass transport, thus improving the catalytic activity. The optimal sample Co3FeNx-10/NC LACC shows a superior activity toward oxygen evolution reaction (OER) with low overpotential of 270 mV to achieve 10 mA cm(-1) as well as the Tafel slope of 52.5 mV dec(-1), which ranks in the most-efficient transition-metal-nitrides-based electrocatalysts. In addition, the Co3FeNx-10/NC LACC also exhibits robust long-term durability, which it retains high catalytic activity even after 40 h of continuous operation.

One of the best performing catalysts reported to date for water oxidation under alkaline conditions is nickel oxyhydroxide (NiOOH) doped with iron. However, NiOOH has hydrogen atoms whose positions are not known and may transfer through the material. In order to understand how hydrogen transfer affects catalytic efficiency, we use density functional theory+U (DFT +U) calculations that model oxygen evolution reaction catalysis for pure and Fe-doped NiOOH. Our calculations reveal that hydrogen transfer is possible in the Fe-doped case but is less probable in the pure case. The duality of proton and charge transfer at the surface of reactive materials provides further evidence to the effectiveness of doping for improving catalysis.									14	0	0	0	1	0	14			1932-7447			WOS:000407655900016

The application of current and potential values from the polarisation curve obtained from the Tafel equation, produces two distinguishable straight lines; one in the region of oxygen evolution, the other in the region of the Kolbe reaction. Tafel plots, as the solution contains gradually increasing amounts of either NaNO3 or Na2SO4, generally shift upward in the region of oxygen evolution, and downward in the region of the Kolbe reaction (the transfer coefficient alpha in the latter case increases remarkably). When Na3PO4 is used, Tafel plots generally shift downward in either region.									0	0	0		0	0	0			0027-7568			INSPEC:1327800

Herein, an advanced NGC@Co4S3/NixS(6)(7 >= x >= 6)/NiOOH hybrid by simultaneously encapsuling Co4S3, NixS(6)(7 >= x >= 6) and NiOOH nanocrystals on 3D nitrogen-doped graphene-carbon nanotubes (NGC) composite support was fabricated via an in-situ hydrothermal method. Cyclic votammetry (CV), rotating disk electrode (RDE), rotating ring disk electrode (RRDE) and current-time chronoamperometric response were employed to examine the electrochemical performance of the materials. As a consequence, the obtained catalyst not only achieved excellent activity for oxygen reduction reaction, such as similar kinetic parameters compared with 20 wt% Pt/C, but also possessed better durability. Furthermore, our proposed catalyst displayed considerable oxygen evolution reaction properties in comparison with RuO2, like closed overpotential at the current density of 10 mA cm (2) and good stability after 200 cycles of testing. The outstanding electrochemical performance can be ascribed to the good conductivity and large specific surface area of the substrate with interpenetrated structure and the synergistic couplings between multiple active sites of metallic nanocrystals and NGC building blocks.

We propose functionalization with two transition metals, cobalt and nickel, expecting a synergic effect in electrocatalytic activity in a water splitting reaction. These electrocatalytic reactions are essential for efficient electrochemical energy storage. The thin flakes were obtained by exfoliation of bulk molybdenum diselenide. Next, after deposition of metals, precursors were carbonized. Electrochemical data reveal that the presence of Ni and Co particles boosts electrocatalyst performance, providing a great number of active sites due to their conductivity. Interestingly, the material exhibited great evolution potential and good stability in long-term tests.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			2470-1343			WOS:000592385200036	33195926

Herein, we reported a general strategy for synthesis of a series of TMPs (Fe2P, FeP, Co2P, CoP, Ni2P, and Ni12P5) nanoparticles (NPs) with different metal phases embedded in a N-doped carbon (NC) matrix using metal salt, ammonium dihydrogen phosphate, and melamine as precursor with varying molar ratios and thermolysis temperatures. The resultant TMPs can serve as highly active and durable bifunctional electrocatalyst toward HER and oxygen evolution reaction (OER). In particular, the Ni2P@ NC phase only requires an overpotential of similar to 138 mV to derive HER in 0.5 M H2SO4 and similar to 320 mV for OER in 1.0 M KOH at the current density of 10 mA cm(-2). Because of the encapsulation of NC that can effectively prevent corrosion of embedded TMP NPs, Ni2P@ NC exhibits almost unfading catalytic performance even after 10 h under both acidic and alkaline solutions. This synthesis strategy provides a new avenue to exploring TMPs as highly active and stable electrocatalyst for the HER, OER, and other electrochemical applications.									141	4	0	0	3	0	144			1944-8244			WOS:000401782500030	28452469

However, which type of N-dopants contributing to the enhanced catalytic performance and the catalytic performances of other heteroatom-doped graphdiynes has not been explored systematically. Herein, ORR and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalytic performances of X-doped graphdiynes are examined by means of DFT computations (X = B, N, P, and S). It is revealed that the graphitic S-doped graphdiyne (Model S1), the sp-N-doped graphdiyne (Model N3) and the graphitic P-doped graphdiyne (Model P1) exhibit comparable or even better ORR/OER activities than Pt/C or RuO2, with ORR activity trend as Model S1 > Pt/C > Model N3 and OER trend as Model P1 > RuO2 > Model N3. The carbon atoms near N- and S-dopants and featuring large positive charge are the ORR active sites in Models N3 and S1, whereas the carbon atoms near N- and P-dopants and possessing high spin are the OER active sites in Models N3 and P1. Overall, this study not only gains deep insights into the catalytic activity of N-doped graphdiyne for ORR, but also guides developing of graphdiyne-based ORR/OER catalysts beyond N-doping.									91	13	0	0	2	0	90			2366-9608			WOS:000485927700006

In order to solve the problem of low oxygen evolution efficiency of the current OER catalysts, a novel material was synthesized by the incorporation of NiFeCr-LDH and MoS2, and its structural and electrochemical properties were also investigated. The introduction of MoS2 improves the electrochemical performance of NiFeCr-LDH. The polarization curve shows that the potential of composite material is only 1.50 Vat a current density of 10 mA cm(-2), which is far superior to commercial precious metal catalysts. In addition, the stability experiment shows that the composite material has excellent stability, and the current density has little change after 500 cycles. Furthermore, we found that some metal ions, such as Ni, Cr and Mo, exist in the form of high valence on the surface of NiFeCr-LDH@MoS2, which is also conducive to the occurrence of oxygen evolution reaction.

In this Minireview, we focus on the recent advances in establishing semiconductor quantum dot (QD) assemblies to enhance the efficiencies of these light-driven multielectron reduction reactions. Four models of QD assembly are established to promote the sluggish kinetics of multielectron transfer from QDs to cocatalysts, thus leading to an enhanced activity of solar H-2 evolution or CO2 reduction. We also forecast the potential applications of QD assemblies in other multielectron redox reactions, such as nitrogen (N-2) fixation and oxygen (O-2) evolution from H2O.									60	8	0	0	3	0	63			1433-7851	1521-3773		WOS:000478635100004	30821022

Here, authors examine electrochemical Li intercalation to improve the activity and stability of RuO2 for acidic water oxidation.Developing highly active and durable electrocatalysts for acidic oxygen evolution reaction remains a great challenge due to the sluggish kinetics of the four-electron transfer reaction and severe catalyst dissolution. Here we report an electrochemical lithium intercalation method to improve both the activity and stability of RuO2 for acidic oxygen evolution reaction. The lithium intercalates into the lattice interstices of RuO2, donates electrons and distorts the local structure. Therefore, the Ru valence state is lowered with formation of stable Li-O-Ru local structure, and the Ru-O covalency is weakened, which suppresses the dissolution of Ru, resulting in greatly enhanced durability. Meanwhile, the inherent lattice strain results in the surface structural distortion of LixRuO2 and activates the dangling O atom near the Ru active site as a proton acceptor, which stabilizes the OOH* and dramatically enhances the activity. This work provides an effective strategy to develop highly efficient catalyst towards water splitting.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1				2041-1723		WOS:000819790100020	35778401

By doubling the individual metal concentrations in the equimolar (Mg, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu) oxide, Fe was found to play the key role in enhancing the OER performance. The effect of the most dominate Fe on the OER activity was studied by varying the Fe concentration in the equimolar oxide.

Some eartha-bundant transition metal oxides have certain levels of bi-functional ORR/OER catalytic activities yet low electronic conductivities. The addition of high-electronic-conductivity material such as carbon black could result in another problem because there is low compatibility between metal oxide and carbon. In this work, polymer chains are ultrasonically prepared to act as binders to anchor metal-oxide active sites to porous domains of carbon black. The monomer N-isopropyl acrylamide is polymerized under ultrasonication instead of using conventional radical initiators which are dangerous and harmful. Reactive free radicals produced by ultrasonic irradiation can also help to form the Mn-Ni-Fe tri-metallic oxide. Thus, aided by the amide-type polymer as an adhesive, the tri-metallic oxide anchored on polymer-grafted carbon black prepared by ultrasonication possess a large number of metal-oxide active sites and hierarchical pores, contributing substantially to the enhanced ORR/OER electrocatalytic performance in the RZABs. Accordingly, this work provides interesting insight into the effective combination of inherently incompatible components for the fabrication of composite materials from an ultrasonic standpoint.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			1350-4177	1873-2828		WOS:000811598500001	34839126

Herein, we report the use of titanium carbonitride as an efficient and stable support in acidic media. Pt3M (M = Ru, Ir, Ta) nanoparticles supported on titanium carbonitride were synthesized by the ethylene glycol method and characterized by transmission electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction and inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry. The electrochemical activity toward oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER), as well as the stability of the catalysts, was tested employing a rotating ring-disk electrode. The activity of the three catalysts is similar for the ORR. However, for the OER, Pt3Ru/TiCN appears to be the best catalyst by far. Pt3Ru/TiCN was also compared with a commercial RuO2 catalyst, obtaining a better performance for the supported catalyst even though the low amount of Ru/RuO2 present in the supported sample. The high activity and stability of the Pt3Ru/TiCN catalyst for the ORR and OER is due to an interesting promotion effect of the titanium carbonitride support, so that this electrocatalyst has a great potential for the application in unitized regenerative fuel cells.

Here we reported a single-wall carbon nanotube (SWCNT) conductive network embedded in porous N, P co-doped carbon (SWCNT@NPC) as a bifunctional oxygen electrocatalyst. The SWCNT@NPC material showed excellent electrocatalytic activity with an oxygen reduction half-wave potential of 0.85 V and oxygen evolution potential of 1.678 Vat 10 mA cm(-2). When used to assemble rechargeable Zn-air batteries, SWCNT@NPC exhibited better catalytic activity as well as durability compared to commercial noble-metal catalysts. In particular, it is demonstrated that mutual promotion between N and P doping induces ultrahigh ORR activity while N doping is identified as the primary active sites for the OER.

This modified nanocomposite showed high electrocatalytic activity towards oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) compared to similarly prepared Au free Ni(OH)(2)-NC/GCE. The above nanocomposite was prepared through two step processes; first gold-nickel hexacyanoferrate nanocomposite film on GCE (Au-NiHCF-NC/GCE) was synthesized by single step electrochemical cycling approach. Later, the Au-NiHCF-NC/GCE was treated electrochemically in alkaline solution to produce Au-Ni(OH)(2)-NC/GCE. The as-formed Au-Ni(OH)(2)-NC/GCE was used as a bifunctional electrode to study the OER and ORR in alkaline solution. The resulting nanocomposite exhibits high electrocatalytic activity and fast electron transfer kinetics due to the synergic effect of the formation of more active beta-Ni(OH)(2) phase and Au nanoparticles (AuNPs) during the electrochemical cycling process.									14	0	0	0	0	0	14			1388-2481	1873-1902		WOS:000408359600014

Herein, we find that oxygen substoichiometric tungsten dioxide nanorods (WO2 NRs) are an appropriate alternative to realize highly efficient O-2 promoted HCHO reforming to produce H-2. Rich oxygen vacancies (OVs) in WO2 NRs play a fundamental role in the MOA induced catalytic H-2 evolution reaction because they guarantee the favorable chemisorption of molecular O-2 on the catalyst surface as well as build up a channel for the delivery of electrons to O-2 species. Importantly, MOA initiated by the WO2 NR catalyst can be achieved by systematically modulating the proton-coupled electron transfer (PCET) pathway to controllably obtain the desired ROS and thus to directionally produce H-2, in which molecular O-2 receives the electrons to form superoxide radicals in a chemisorbed state (O-2(-)) and couple with protons provided by HCHO to convert into OOH radicals, rather than OH or other ROS. The surface stabilized HOO-WO2 NR complex acts as the catalytically active center in the dehydrogenation reaction. As O-2 continuously takes up and releases protons by formation and consumption of OOH radicals, O-2 persistently circulates on the WO2 NR surface, making WO2 NRs an unconventional catalyst. This study develops a new technique for clean energy supply and deepens our understanding of the MOA process during heterogeneous catalysis.									29	0	0	0	4	0	29			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000474712700021

Its high hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) activity enables it to be used as a bifunctional catalyst for less energy-intensive electrolytic hydrogen generation by replacing the sluggish oxygen evolution reaction with HzOR. The corresponding two-electrode electrolyzer using such a nanoarray as both the anode for HzOR and the cathode for HER only needs a cell voltage of 0.2V to drive 10mAcm(-2) in 1.0M KOH with 100mM hydrazine, which is 1.45V less than that for pure water splitting. This electrolyzer also shows strong long-term electrochemical durability with nearly 100% faradic efficiency for hydrogen evolution.									52	2	0	0	3	0	52			2196-0216			WOS:000397473700006

The structure, morphology and valence state of the prepared samples were characterized. Their catalytic activities toward oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) were investigated by rotating-disk electrode (RDE). As expected, appropriate introduce of A-site deficiency can enhance both ORR and OER activities. Among the A-site cation deficient perovskites studied, (Lao 8Sro 2)0 95Mn03 exhibited the highest ORR and OER activities and, hence, the best bifunctionality. After doping with Fe in the B-site, the (Lao 8Sro 2)0 95Mno 5Feo 503 perovskite exhibits even better electrochemical catalytic activity which is due to the increase of the concentration of oxygen vacancy as compared with (Lao 8Sro 2)0 95Mn03. Furthermore, (Lao 8Sro 2)0 95Mno 5Feo 503 showed superior durability than commercial 20wt% Pt/C catalyst. This work indicates that introduce of A-site deficiency and B-site Fe doping in perovskite oxides is an effective strategy to enhance ORR and OER activity for the applications in metal-air batteries.

One of the biggest challenges in developing all-solid-state ZABs is to design suitable bifunctional air-electrodes, which can efficiently catalyze the key oxygen reduction reaction (ORR)/oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrochemical processes. The other one is to develop robust electrolyte membranes with high ionic conductivity and superb water retention capability. In this review, an in-depth discussion of the challenges, mechanisms, and design strategies for the defect electrocatalyst and the electrolyte membrane in all-solid-state ZABs will be offered. In particular, the crucial defect engineering strategies to tune the ORR/OER catalysts are summarized, including direct controllable strategies: 1) atomically dispersed metal sites control, 2) vacancy defects control, and 3) lattice-strain control, and the indirect strategies: 4) crystallographic structure control and 5) metal-carbon support interaction control. Moreover, the most recent progress in designing electrolyte membranes, including polyvinyl alcohol-based membranes and gel polymer electrolyte membranes, is presented. Finally, the perspectives are proposed for rational design and fabrication of the desired air electrode and electrolyte membrane to improve the performance and prolong the lifetime of all-solid-state ZABs.									21	2	0	0	1	0	21			2366-9608			WOS:000596125000001	34927810	
J	Majhi, Kartick Chandra; Yadav, Mahendra								Facile hydrothermal synthesis of rare earth phosphate for boosting hydrogen evolution reaction								INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY				47	30			14092	14103		10.1016/j.ijhydene.2022.02.168				APR 8 2022	2022	The water electrolysis process has attracted great attention due to the production of high energy density pure hydrogen. However, the involved cell reactions in this process such as hydrogen and oxygen evolution reactions are kinetically sluggish and demands high input energy to accelerate the rate of these reactions. Therefore, the development and application of efficient electrocatalyst is essential for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) as well as oxygen evolution reaction (OER). In the present work, we have successfully synthesized two rare earth phosphates through the hydrothermal route and used as a catalysts towards HER in an acidic medium. The rare earth phosphate PrPO(4)exhibits better catalytic activity than YPO4 catalyst. The overpotential of PrPO4, YPO4 and standard Pt/C were found as 147, 484.3 and 58 mV vs. reversible hydrogen electrode, respectively, to reach current density 10 mA center dot cm(-2) and corresponding Tafel slopes were found as 107.58, 118.73 and 80.89 mV decade-1, respectively in 0.5 M H2SO(4). The catalytic activity of PrPO4 (472.83 mA center dot cm(-2)) overcome standard Pt/C (179.60 mA center dot cm(-2)) at high overpotential 450 mV vs. reversible hydrogen electrode. The prepared PrPO4 shows efficient electrocatalytic activity towards HER in acidic medium because it possess high BET surface area, large ECSA value and small charge transfer resistance than YPO4.

In this work, a simple and cost-effective synthesis method was used to prepare nitrogen-iron functionalized carbon nanomaterial using iron acetate, cyanamide, and oxidized carbon black as precursors. We further enhanced the electrocatalytic performance by using a multilayer/multielectric-field-polarization method to prepare the catalyst electrode. The applied dc electric field created a dielectrophoresis phenomenon in the catalyst ink drop-tasted on a glassy carbon working electrode and drove the randomly oriented catalyst particles to a more ordered and compact assembly with more porous structures. The resultant catalyst presented much improved bifunctional electrocatalytic performance for ORR-OER and long-term durability in alkaline electrolyte that is comparable to or even better than that of the state-of-the-art Pt/C and RuO2 catalysts. The electric field polarized catalyst NFe/C-950[235.3 V/mm] exhibited an oxygen electrode activity (OEA) parameter Delta E as 0.740 V, superior to that of Pt/C and RuO2 catalysts as well as most of other non-precious-metal catalysts. Those findings show the great potential of the explored method for various electrochemical applications.									5	0	0	0	1	0	5			2574-0962			WOS:000516665300029

Here we report a reversible oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) process in a sodium-oxygen battery observed using in situ environmental-transmission electron microscopy (TEM) experiment. The reaction mechanism and phase evolution are probed using in situ electron diffraction and TEM imaging. The reversible ORR and OER cycling lies upon the nanosized copper clusters that were formed in situ by sodiation of CuS. In situ electron diffraction revealed the formation of NaO2 initially, which then disproportionated into orthorhombic and hexagonal NaO2, and O-2. Na2O2 was the major final ORR product that uniformly covered the whole wire-shape cathode. This uniform product morphology largely increased the application feasibility of NaO2 batteries in industry. In the following OER process, the Na2O2 transformed to NaO2, which resulted in volume expansion at first, and then the NaO(2 )decomposed to sodium ions and O-2 gas. Galvanostatic charge/discharge profiles of CuS in real NaO2 cells revealed a maximum capacity over 3 mAh cm(-2) with a discharge cutoff voltage of 1.8 V and high cycling stability. The nanosized copper catalyst plays a dominating role in controlling the morphology, chemical composition of discharge products, and reversibility of this Na-O-2 battery. Our finding shines light on the exploration of effective catalysts for the Na-O-2 battery.									24	2	0	0	0	0	24			1936-0851	1936-086X		WOS:000526301400100	32129983

However, highly effective and inexpensive earth-abundant materials are sought after to replace the noble metal-based electrocatalysts currently in use. Recently, metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) and carbon-based MOF derivatives have attracted considerable attention as efficient catalysts due to their exceedingly tunable morphologies, structures, compositions, and functionalization. Here, we report two-dimensional (2D) MOF/MOF derivative coupled arrays on nickel foam as binder-free bifunctional ORR/OER catalysts with enhanced electrocatalytic activity and stability. Their remarkable electrochemical properties are primarily attributed to fully exposed active sites and facilitated charge-transfer kinetics. The coupled and hierarchical nanosheet arrays produced via our growth-pyrolysis-regrowth strategy offer promise in the development of highly active electrodes for energy-related electrochemical devices.

The reaction is driven by the difference in the equilibrium potential of the two metal/ metal ion redox couples and, to avoid parasitic cathodic processes such as oxygen reduction and (in some cases) hydrogen evolution too, both oxygen levels and the pH must be optimized. The resulting bimetallic material can in principle have a M-noble-rich shell and M-rich core (denoted as Mnoble(M)) leading to a possible decrease in noble metal loading and the modification of its properties by the underlying metal M. This paper reviews a number of bimetallic or ternary electrocatalytic materials prepared by galvanic replacement for fuel cell, electrolysis and electrosynthesis reactions. These include oxygen reduction, methanol, formic acid and ethanol oxidation, hydrogen evolution and oxidation, oxygen evolution, borohydride oxidation, and halide reduction.

In this Letter, we report the topotactic conversion of Cu(tetracyanoquinodimethane) nanoarray, denoted as Cu(TCNQ), into Fe(TCNQ)(2) nanoarray via low temperature cationic exchange. As a 3D electrode, such Fe(TCNQ)(2) possesses superior oxygen evolution reaction (OER) performance needing over-potentials as low as 321 and 353 mV to afford 20 and 50 mA cm(-2) in 1.0 M KOH, respectively. Remarkably enough, such a catalyst shows good durability in the long term electrochemical process with its catalytic activity being retained for 25 h at lowest. This work demonstrates that Fe(TCNQ)(2) nanoarray may open up new possibilities for OER application.									23	0	0	0	2	0	23			2168-0485			WOS:000424728300006

Herein, the strain effects on the catalytic performance of Pt-doped Ti2CF2 (Pt-V-F-Ti2CF2) for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) were systematically studied using first principles calculations. Firstly, Pt-V-F-Ti2CF2 exhibits metallic conductivity and good stability under strain in a range of -14% to 14%. Moreover, Pt-V-F-Ti2CF2 under a compressive strain of 14% and tensile strain of 4% shows the highest ORR and OER catalytic performance with an overpotential of 0.45 V and 0.43 V, respectively. The overpotential of the ORR and OER can be reduced by 0.28 V and 0.03 V when a specific strain was applied. Additionally, Pt-V-F-Ti2CF2 under a specific strain shows a higher selectivity by significantly suppressing the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Furthermore, we analyzed the reasons behind this performance boost. The enhanced catalytic performance of Pt-V-F-Ti2CF2 by strain engineering can be attributed to the shift of the d-band center and work function. Overall, our work demonstrated that strain engineering can effectively improve the catalytic efficiency and selectivity of Pt-V-F-Ti2CF2 and may provide insightful guidance for the design and development of other high-performance two-dimensional catalysts.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000732860500001

These surfaces were used as working electrodes in the rotating disk electrode (RDE) setup and characterized in alkaline electrolyte (0.1 M NaOH at 25 +/- 2 degrees C) for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), and the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) for their potential application in alkaline electrolyzers or in alkaline fuel cells. The electrochemical performances of these electrodes were investigated as a function of their crystallized state (amorphous versus crystalline). Although none of the materials display spectacular HER and OER activity, the results show interesting performances of the crystallized sample towards the ORR with regards to this class of non-Pt group metal (non-PGM) electrocatalysts, the activity being, however, still far from a benchmark Pt/C electrocatalyst.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			2073-4344			WOS:000448543300057

Herein, by means of surface reorganization engineering of bimetal Al, Co-doped MoS2 (devoted as AlCo3-MoS2) through in situ substituting partial oxidation, we successfully significantly activate the OER activity of MoS2, which affords a considerably low overpotential of 323 mV at -30 mA cm(-2), far lower than those of MoS2, Al-MoS2 and Co-MoS2 catalysts. Essentially, the AlCo3- MoS2 substrate produces lots of M-O (M=Al, Co and Mo) species with oxygen vacancies, which trigger the surface self-reconstruction of pre-catalysts and simultaneously boost the electrocatalytic OER activity. Moreover, benefiting from the moderate M-O species formed on the surface, the redistribution of surface electron states is induced, thus optimizing the adsorption of OH* and OOH* intermediates on metal oxyhydroxides and awakening the OER activity of MoS2.

In a Zn-air battery, surface/interface chemistry plays a key role in their performance optimization of power density, stability and rechargeable efficiency. A Zn-air battery requires gas-involved ORR (oxygen reduction reaction) and OER (oxygen evolution reaction) reactions, always leading to complex reactions and sluggish kinetic processes at the three-phase interface, in which rational surface/interface nanoengineering at the micro and meso-level play a decisive role. In this review, we cover the influence of surface/interface properties of electrocatalysts and air electrodes on the performance of rechargeable Zn-air batteries, and the latest surface/interface nanoengineering progress from the micro to meso-level is surveyed. Moreover, the surface/interface characteristics of electrocatalysts and air electrodes at the triple-phase interface, which are closely related to the four key parameters of electrical conductivity, reaction energy barrier, reaction surface area and mass transfer behavior, are also described in detail. Based on the discussion of the latest achievements of surface/interface nanoengineering, some personal perspectives on future advanced development of rechargeable Zn-air batteries are presented as well.									164	10	0	0	4	0	166			1754-5692	1754-5706		WOS:000528728700003

Compared with the two-electron process in HER, the four-electron process of OER is slow because of the more complex series of reactions. Therefore, a good understanding of the direct O-2 evolution mechanism (DOEM) in OER is crucial to design high-efficiency catalysts to overcome the limitations imposed by the conventional adsorption evolution mechanism. In this work, honeycomb Ni3N-Co3N was prepared on carbon cloth (Ni3N-Co3N/CC) to investigate the DOEM. Density functional theory and in situ Raman scattering spectroscopy demonstrated that the OER process on Ni3N-Co3N/CC proceeded via the DOEM pathway, in which Ni3N and Co3N share the roles of dragging OH-, splitting off H-O bonds, and adsorbing other OH-, leading to significantly reduced Gibbs's energy barriers of Delta G(*OH) to Delta G(O*) and Delta G(O*) to Delta G(O*OH) Moreover, the vertical honeycomb structure and conductive CC substrate contributed to the structural stability, conductivity, and quick O-2 release capability. The Ni3N-Co3N/CC required low overpotentials of 320 and 495 mV to reach a current density of 10 and 100 mA cm(-2) , respectively. Moreover, the Ni3N-Co3N/CC delivered excellent stability with >90% retention of the initial current density over an 80h-long test.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			2095-8226	2199-4501		WOS:000788961800003

Ni-Fe layered double hydroxides (Ni-Fe LDHs) are highly efficient materials for mediating the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), a half-reaction for water splitting at the anode, but LDHs typically display poor HER performance. Here, we report the preparation of self-organized Ag@NiFe layered double hydroxide core-shell electrodes on Ni foam (Ag@NiFe/NF) prepared by galvanic etching for mediating both the HER and OER (bifunctional water-splitting electrocatalysis). This synthetic strategy allowed for the preparation of organized hierarchical architectures which displayed improved the electrochemical performance by tuning the electronic structure of the catalyst and increasing the surface area utilization. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and theoretical calculations revealed that electron transfer from the Ni-Fe LDH to Ag influenced the adsorption of the reaction intermediates leading to enhanced catalytic activity. The Ag@NiFe/NF electrode displayed overpotentials as low as 180 and 80 mV for oxygen and hydrogen evolution, respectively, at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2), and improvements in the specific activity by similar to 5x and similar to 1.5x for the oxygen and hydrogen evolution reaction, respectively, compared to benchmark NiFe hydroxide materials. Additionally, an integrated water-splitting electrolyzer electrode can be driven by an AA battery.									13	0	0	0	0	0	13			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000662086600045	34036787

Herein, we demonstrate a facile sol-gel method for fabrication of a trimetal-based oxide FeCoCrOx for efficient OER. The FeCoCrOx shows a low overpotential (only 245 mV) at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) and good electrochemical durability in alkaline medium.

Control the hydrolysis product is crucial for design of highly active catalyst. Herein, we introduced pyrazine molecules pillared Hofmann-type metal organic framework electrocatalysts. The in-situ formed amorphous hydroxide provided high electrocatalytic activity and the interplanar pyrazine molecule offered structural stability towards alkaline environment, which effectively boosted the OER catalytic activity by offering more accessible active sites. The enhanced structural stability was justified by Raman spectroscopy.

Notwithstanding the achieved progress, the overpotential of heteroatom doped graphene is still very large. Herein, we coat FeNiIr nanoalloys by nitrogen-doped graphene with coreshell structure (FeNiIr@NG) to further boost the OER activity on graphene surface. Because of the unique core-shell structure, FeNiIr@NG delivers high electrocatalytic OER activity and durability, even exceeding that of commercial IrO2 electrocatalyst. Density functional theory calculations demonstrate that the nanoalloys core could transfer electron to outer graphene shells, which optimizes the electronic structure of graphene and balances the adsorption strength of OER intermediates, thereby triggering OER activity on the graphene surface.

To increase the utilization, the iridium electrocatalyst is typically dispersed on a high-surface area support material. This results in less iridium being required and consequently reduced catalyst cost.

When the anatase TiO2 NTA was cathodically polarized, its color changed to blue, and it could be used as an electrochemically active anode for an oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in alkaline water electrolysis. The structure of the blue anatase TiO2 NTA was controlled by the anodization conditions and its catalytic activity increased with an increase of the surface area. The activity of the blue anatase TiO2 NTA gradually reduced with the continued OER because of the partial oxidation of Ti3+ to Ti4+. However, an intermittent cathodic regeneration process could significantly slow its reduction rate. The blue anatase TiO2 NTA could be an alternative anode for alkaline water electrolysis.									4	1	0	0	1	0	5			2093-8551			WOS:000378157500009

In this paper, flower-like nickel-cobalt phenylphosphonate microspheres were sythesized, which could be used as excellent electrocatalyst for OER. After calcined at high temperature in air, resulted product of metal pyrophosphate exhibited outstanding electrocatalytic property. A small amount of carbon coming from the pyrolysis of phenylphosphonate were doped in matrix of metal pyrophosphonate, which promoted the OER catalysis by improving the electron transfer of material.

Herein, first-principles density functional theory (DFT) calculations demonstrated that single-metal-atom (Fe, Co, or Ni) sites can bind to the surface of 2D WO2, enhancing the adsorption of intermediates involved in the OER/ORR. Furthermore, it was found that the single-metal-atom-doped 2D WO2 achieves the smallest OER and ORR overpotentials of 0.42 V and 0.40 V, respectively, which are comparable to those of IrO2 or Pt-based catalysts. This predicts the excellent OER/ORR catalytic activities of the single-metal-atom (Fe, Co, or Ni) doped 2D WO2, which would be a promising bifunctional catalyst for fuel cells, water splitting, and metal-air batteries.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			1463-9076	1463-9084		WOS:000661197900001	34125123

Ag3PO4 has been actively pursued as a promising photocatalyst for oxygen evolution from water-splitting. However, its low OER efficiency is a long standing problem. Both the construction of Z-scheme Ag3PO4-based composite photocatalytic systems and the optimization of surface morphology and interfacial contact in heterojunctions photocatalysts would be beneficial for boosting OER efficiency. Here we report on the fabrication of Ag3PO4/fish scale-like graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) sheet composites with well-defined heterostructures and intimate interfacial contact driven by electrostatic assembly. The Ag3PO4/modified g-C3N4 composites photocatalyst reveals significantly enhanced oxygen-evolving activity under light-emitting diode (LED) illumination. Effective surface modification of g-C3N4, strong interfacial interactions between two semiconductors and tandem Z-scheme-type pathway for more efficient charge transfer synergistically accelerates the redox capability of Ag3PO4 for OER. This work may provide new insights into the design and construction of high-performance solar-driven Z-scheme photocatalytic water splitting systems.									235	19	0	0	34	0	238			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000457952600025

In this multilevel structure, rocksalt-type Fe-doped NiO phase hybrids with Ni clusters coupled into the nanospheres anchored to the outside of nanotube, forming a unique 3D corn-like structure. This novel multi-level structure represents a large specific area for catalytic reaction. X-ray absorption fine structure indicates that the defect-rich Fe-doped NiO phase has abundant coordinative unsaturated sites as active sites, and Fe doping downshifts the d band of metal sites, which is the main contribution to the improved oxygen evolution reaction catalytic activity. The OER of Fe-NiO-Ni CHNAs obeys the adsorbate evolution mechanism with the nonconcerted proton-electron transfer pathway as a rate-determining step. Thus Fe-doped NiO CHNAs exhibits excellent OER performance and outstanding durability that surpasses most of transition metal oxides.									54	1	0	0	1	0	54			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000623243500001

However, the kinetically sluggishness of OER and the high prices as well as the scarcity of the most active precious metal electrocatalysts are the major bottleneck in these devices. Developing low-cost non-precious metal catalysts with high activity and stability for OER is highly desirable. A facile, in situ template method combining the dodecyl benzene sulfuric acid sodium (SDBS) assisted hydrothermal process with subsequent high-temperature treatment was developed to prepare porous Co3O4 with improved surface area and hierarchical porous structure as precious catalysts alternative for oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Due to the unique structure, the as-prepared catalyst shows higher electrocatalytic activity than Co3O4 prepared by traditional thermal-decomposition method (noted as Co3O4-T) and commercial IrO2 catalyst for OER in 0.1 M KOH aqueous solution. Moreover, it displays improved stability than Co3O4-T. The results demonstrate a highly efficient, scalable, and low cost method for developing highly active and stable OER electrocatalysts in alkaline solutions.

In this paper, we introduced a new strategy to synthesize Ni doped Co/NC catalysts (NC is the abbreviation of nitrogen-doped graphitic carbon), which were derived from ZIF-67. All catalysts were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscope (TEM) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The results show that Ni was well doped in the Ni/Co/NC catalysts and the doping of Ni has great influence on the OER activity of Ni/Co/NC catalysts. Among these catalysts, 0.50Ni/Co/NC exhibits the highest OER activity. The onset potential of 0.50Ni/Co/NC is 1.47 V, which is superior than the onset potential of Co/NC (1.54 V), 0.25Ni/Co/NC (1.48 V), 1.00Ni/Co/NC (1.53 V). The excellent OER activity of 0.50Ni/Co/NC catalyst makes its potential to be used on renewable energy storage.									26	1	0	0	1	0	26			0022-4596	1095-726X		WOS:000424857600001

For the first time the electrocatalytic performance of the ultrathin Co9S8 nanosheets for both oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) was investigated. Benefiting from the larger electrochemical active surface area and more exposed accessible active sites, the ultrathin Co9S8 nanosheets, meanwhile, presented a remarkable performance towards OER and excellent catalytic activity for the HER process. To reach a current density of 10 mA cm(-2), the overpotential is only 206mV for OER in 1.0M KOH, which is very close to RuO2 (200 mV). For HER, a low overpotential of only 178mV is needed to reach 10 mA cm(-2) in 0.5 M H2SO4.

Thus, the three half-reactions, namely, CO2 reduction reaction, hydrogen evolution reaction, and the oxygen evolution counter reaction, in these two electrolytic processes have attracted wide research interest. Organic polymer electrocatalysts or electrocatalysts containing organic components play important roles in these catalytic processes. It has been shown that the organic molecules can efficiently catalyze the reactions themselves, and modulate the active sites towards high selectivity and efficiency. The roles of the organic molecules in conducting polymers, the metal complexes, and the framework materials are extracted for the three half-reactions mentioned above, and this comprehensive review will serve as a guide for future research and aid in the design of electrocatalysts related to organic molecules.									10	1	0	0	2	0	10			0947-6539	1521-3765		WOS:000452614800010	30156031

The theoretical model developed for the process kinetics assumes that molecules of hypochlorous acid participate in the oxygen evolution. The process rate is characterized by first reaction order by active chlorine, provided molecules of hypochlorous acid can inhibit the process due to their reversible adsorption on the anode surface. Mathematical modeling methods are employed to demonstrate the model adequacy to experiment.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1023-1935			WOS:000170719700005

Toward this issue, a novel "magnetic field-inducement" strategy is applied to improve the electrocatalysis of Co3O4/NF. The effects of magnetic field strength and direction on electrocatalysis are investigated in detail. The results exhibit that the applied magnetic field can effectively decrease the over potential and Tafel slope of Co3O4/NF for oxygen evolution reaction. When a 125 mT magnetic field is perpendicular to the electric field, Co3O4/NF just shows an overpotential of 252 mV at the current density of 20 mA cm(-2) and gives a low Tafel slope of 26.7 mV.dec(-1), presenting much better catalytic properties than that in normal condition. The obvious enhancement could arise from the magnetohydrodynamic effect near the electrode and the enhanced energy states of electrons induced by the magnetic field. Hence, this work introduces a practical way to improve the performance of catalysts efficiently without farther structural modification, morphological controlling and material cladding.									52	2	0	0	3	0	51			0378-7753	1873-2755		WOS:000480670200003

However, the existing high-performance phosphide catalysts for oxygen evolution reaction have bottlenecks such as difficulty to accurately determine the components and the catalytic mechanism. Therefore, in this study, we designed and synthesized FeP/CoP heterogeneous materials with a unique porous morphology as OER catalysts. The as-prepared heterogeneous materials have excellent OER catalytic activity and stability. The overpotential at 10 mA cm(-2) is only 266 mV, and the Tafel slope is 60.86 mV dec(-1). We believe that the good catalytic performance of the as-prepared material is mainly due to the unique morphology and redistribution of interfacial charges. The results of this study provide new ideas for designing efficient metal phosphide-based OER catalysts.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1144-0546	1369-9261		WOS:000830470900001

Herein, porous NiCo2O4 nanobelts with controlled oxygen deficiencies were synthesized based on a facile strategy of hydrothermal growth followed by annealing under an inert atmosphere. By finely adjusting annealing temperature and time, concentrations of oxygen deficiencies within the nanobelts could be modulated. The oxygen-deficient NiCo2O4 nanobelts exhibit superior oxygen evolution reaction (OER) performance at a relatively low overpotential which is superior to the values of prepared pristine NiCo2O4 electrocatalysts. In particular, they show excellent stability for 10 h at 10 mA cm(-2). The enhanced OER activity and stability of the catalyst can be ascribed to the abundant oxygen deficiencies as well as porous architecture of the anisotropic nanobelts. This work paves a promising way in fabricating advanced electrocatalysts.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			2044-4753	2044-4761		WOS:000609012400021

Two different electrochemical techniques were coupled to mass spectrometric gas analysis using a new solid electrochemical mass spectrometric monitoring device. Under cathodic polarization, the lack of oxygen in the gas phase induces the reduction of the YSZ solid electrolyte which acts as oxygen source for the formation of O(2-) ions migrating to the anode. Under anodic polarization, both platinum oxidation and oxygen evolution reaction are identified. PtO (x) is formed at both the Pt/YSZ and the Pt/gas interface according to two different mechanisms. At the Pt/YSZ interface, PtO (x) formation is an electrochemical process following a parabolic growth law, while the presence of PtO (x) at the Pt/gas interface is related to the diffusion of PtO (x) formed at the triple phase boundary towards the Pt/gas interface. It is proposed that the side oxygen evolution reaction stabilizes thermodynamically the PtO (x) diffusion toward the gas exposed interface during the anodic polarization.									8	0	0	0	0	0	8			0021-891X			WOS:000281970900024

Here, by combining multiple operando synchrotron spectroscopies, we identify at the atomic level a general evolution of single-atom Ni at SLEIs into a near-free atom state in the electrochemical oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). We uncover that the single-atom Ni at SLEIs tends to be dynamically released from the nitrogen-carbon substrate and then forms a near-free, isolated-zigzag active site (Ni1(2-delta)+N2) during the reaction. This isolated-zigzag Ni1(2-delta)+N2 active site facilitates the adsorption and dissociation of O-2 into a crucial *O intermediate within the electrical double layers, realizing a highly efficient single-atom catalyst with the best ORR performance in alkaline solutions reported thus far. These findings may pave a general way for dissecting other important structural dynamic processes at SLEIs, such as hydrogen evolution, oxygen evolution, and CO2 reduction reactions.									53	1	0	0	5	0	53			0002-7863	1520-5126		WOS:000551495700045	32579351

In our work, nonprecious chromium dopant is introduced into the CoFe layered double hydroxide (LDH) via a facile one-step hydrothermal method.

However, all of these unique merits rely on the stability of the SAC, as reported by many investigators. To avoid aggregation of single-metal atoms and maintain the high performance of the SAC, various substrates have been tried to support them, particularly on graphene nanosheets. A spontaneous interface phenomenon between graphene and the Co (and Ni) substrate discovered in this work is that the holes in the graphene layer can stimulate metal atoms to pop up from a metal substrate and fill the double vacancy in graphene (DV-G) and stabilize on the graphene surface. The unique structure of the lifted metal atom is expected to be useful for the bifunctional SAC for electrocatalytic oxygen evolution reactions (OERs) and oxygen reduction reactions (ORRs). Our first-principles calculations indicate that the DV-G on the Co(0001) surface can serve as an excellent bifunctional OER/ORR catalyst in alkaline media with extremely low overpotentials of 0.39 V for OER and only 0.36 V for ORR processes, which are even lower than those for previously reported bifunctional catalysts. We believe that the catalytic activity stems from the interface coupling effect between the DV-G and metal substrate, as well as the charge redistribution in the graphitic sheet.									20	1	0	0	0	0	20			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000468364500031	31021081

Herein, N, F co-doped carbon material (NF@CB) was synthesized as metal-free efficient bifunctional electrocatalysts by directly pyrolyzing a mixture of carbon black, polytetrafluoroethylene and melamine. Benefiting from the synergistic effects between N and F atoms, NF@CB exhibits a positive half-wave potential (E-1/2) of 0.814 V (vs. RHE) for oxygen reduction reaction, and an operating potential (E-10) of 1.609 V at 10 mA cm(-2) for oxygen evolution reaction in alkaline electrolyte. The bifunctional oxygen electrocatalytic activity index (Delta E = E-10-E-1/2) is 0.795 V, which is notably better than that of the single N-doped carbon (1.238 V), and similar to that of the commercial Pt/C and RuO2 mixture catalyst (0.793 V). Impressively, the assembled Zn-air battery (ZAB) with NF@CB as an air-electrode catalyst displays a small charge/discharge voltage gap of 0.852 V at 20 mA cm(-2). Moreover, the NF@CB catalyzed ZAB exhibits good rechargeability and long-lasting cycling stability with over 49 h.

Typical four-step associative process was used to investigate the OER on (110) surface of W doped SnO2. The analysis of OER indicated that the free energy difference Delta G(4) of the third proton-transfer on the (110) W SnO2 with W on the surface layer contributed to the super-high oxygen evolution potential.

In this work, Co-Co3O4/N-doped carbon nanosheets (NCNs) were developed as highly efficient bifunctional oxygen catalysts via the pyrolysis of a hybrid ZIF-67/CNs precursor. It is found that the introduced CNs play important roles. On one hand, the introduced CNs can tune the surface contents of Co, N and/or O species that are closely correlated with OER and ORR activity. On the other hand, they also facilitate to achieve high specific surface areas for the catalysts. In addition, the introduced CNs helps the formed Co-Co3O4 hybrid nanoparticles with uniform and small sizes to be well distributed on the NCNs substrates. Despite such important roles, it should be noted that a moderate content of the introduced CNs is required to achieve optimal oxygen catalytic activity. As a result, the optimized ZIF-67/CNs(1)-600 exhibits a low value of rho (similar to 350 mV) for OER and a high value of E-1/2 (similar to 0.85 V) for ORR. Its overall bifunctional activity (AE) is as low as similar to 0.73 V, which is comparable to the recent reported Co-based catalysts. (C) 2019 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC.

By varying the sulfur doping duration, the sulfur doping ratios can be altered, the morphology changed from nanorod to nanosheet, the defect oxygen density may be varied, and the electronic state can be modulated. The electronic state modification is identified to be predominant, while morphology and defect oxygen changes contribute to the promoted OER performance to certain degree. The S-NiCoOx-5 h sample possesses an optimum density of state near the Fermi level and the enlarged electrochemical active surface area, endowing a superior OER performance as indicated by the satisfactory 221 mV of overpotential required at 10 mA/cm(2). After integration with our earlier-developed HER-active NiCo-based phosphate catalyst, a remarkable 1.61 V is obtained to drive the overall water splitting to reach 10 mA/cm(2) in 1 M KOH. This work highlights the promotion effect of S incorporation for OER and offers a robust and efficient catalytic system for practical hydrogen production through water electrolysis.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			2468-8231			WOS:000579529100002

Although the cuffing-edge transition metal-based layered hydroxides have been intensively investigated towards oxygen evolution reaction, the non-negligible issues of low electronic conductivity and idiopathic aggregation of hydroxide layers are not well addressed, which likely lead to significant ohmic resistance and mass transfer limitation, respectively. Herein, we report a three-dimensional composite catalyst of FeNi layered double hydroxide propped by Fe, N co-doped carbon nanofibers. The introduction of a spacer, Fe, N co-doped carbon nanofibers, not only improves the conductivity, but also exposes more active sites and provides rich porous structures for mass transfer. Reasonably, the composite catalyst demonstrates an excellent activity towards oxygen evolution reaction with only 0.263 V in overpotential at the current density of 10 mA cm(-2); meanwhile, such a catalyst presents almost no fading after 1000 cycles between 1.0 and 1.6 V. In addition, a synergy between Fe, N co-doping in carbon nanofibers and FeNi layered double hydroxide is revealed to account for the enhanced activity and durability in this report.									17	0	0	0	1	0	17			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000472183900006		
J	Jiang, Xue; Wang, Yong; Jia, Baorui; Qu, Xuanhui; Qin, Mingli								Using Machine Learning to Predict Oxygen Evolution Activity for Transition Metal Hydroxide Electrocatalysts								ACS APPLIED MATERIALS & INTERFACES											10.1021/acsami.2c13435		AUG 2022			2022	Electrocatalytic water splitting is an attractive way to generate hydrogen and oxygen for obtaining clean energy. Oxygen evolution reaction (OER), as one of the half reactions of oxygen evolution, is kinetically unfavorable involving the transfer of four electrons. Hydroxides are promising candidates for efficient OER electrocatalysts toward water splitting because of their high intrinsic activity and active surface area. However, quantitative prediction of hydroxide electrocatalytic performances from high-dimensional component spaces remains a challenge, severely hindering the performance-oriented precise composition and process design. Herein, we introduce a machine learning-based OER activity prediction method for hydroxide catalysts under extensive doping space for the first time. The relationship among composition, morphology, phase, pH value of the electrolyte, type of the working electrode, and overpotential was successfully fitted by the random forest algorithm. The model shows a good precision on the forecast of new experiments with a mean relative error of 4.74%. Furthermore, a new high-activity hydroxide catalyst Ni0.77Fe0.13La0.1 was rationally designed and experimentally prepared, showing an ultra-low OP of 226 mV for a current density of 10 mA cm(-2). This work provides an effective and novel way for hydroxide electrocatalyst prediction, which can further enhance the electrocatalyst design toward high catalytic performance.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000860408200001	36044226

Herein, an amorphous ternary Co-Ni-Cu lamellar hydroxide was synthesized using a facile co-precipitation method.

At these polarizations, the main reaction is oxygen evolution on a porous deposit of PbO2, or PbO2 + MnO2 in Mn2+-containing electrolytes. in all cases, the electrode impedance reveals a slow electrode activation with increasing polarization, probably related to the deposit conductivity. With lead-silver anodes it also appears an inhibition process of the main reaction, which becomes more important and turns into passivation, when the electrolyte contains Mn2+ ions. This process has been assigned to the formation of inhibiting adsorbates on the oxide layers.									28	7	0	0	1	0	34			0013-4686			WOS:A1996TJ13800011

However, bifunctional electrocatalytic activities for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) remain challenging in COFs. In this study, imidazolium-rich COFs (IMCOFs) with well-defined active sites and characteristic three-dimensional assembly structures were readily prepared, and their electronic structures were tuned by Co incorporation to elicit bifunctional electrocatalytic activities for the ORR and OER. The Co nanoparticle-incorporated spherical IMCOF-derived electrocatalyst (CoNP-s-IMCOF) exhibited lower overpotentials for the ORR and OER compared with the atomic Co-incorporated planar IMCOF-derived electrocatalyst (Co-p-IMCOF). Computational simulations revealed that the imidazole carbon sites of CoNP-s-INICOF rather than the triazine carbons were the active sites for the ORR and OER, and its p-band center downshifted via charge transfer, facilitating the chemisorption of oxygen intermediates during the reactions. A Zn-air battery with CoNP-s-IMCOF exhibited a small voltage gap of 1.3 V with excellent durability for 935 cycles. This approach for control over the three-dimensional assembly and electronic structures of IMCOFs can be extended to the development of diverse catalytic nanomaterials for applications of interest.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000820834800001	35584866

In this regard, developing electrocatalysts with considerable oxygen reaction activity (ORR/OER) is urgently needed. By virtue of the high specific surface area and enhanced electrical conductivity, carbon-based candidates have garnered considerable research attention. In this regard, the development of effective strategies to enhance the intrinsic site activity is the mainstream direction and has made great progress. Recently, doping engineering has been demonstrated as an effective strategy to promote the catalytic performance. In this review, we focus on the recent progress in developing carbon-based oxygen electrocatalysts for ZABs. And the relationship between doping engineering and the intrinsic activity of oxygen electrocatalysis is particularly outlined.

The important feature of the above composite material is the availability of oxygen vacancy as well as the presence of dual oxidation state of Mn (Mn4+, Mn3+) which enhances surface activity as well as chemical reaction output of the material. Among the synthesized materials a-MnO2@B/O-g-C3N4 (MBOCN-20) shows best photocatalytic activity by following Z-Scheme charge dynamics towards water oxidation (295.1 mmol h(-1)) and reduction (560.1 mmol h(-1)) reactions in presence of methanol (hole scavenger) and AgNO3 (electron scavenger) as sacrificial agent. However, 44.2 and 86.5 mmol h(-1 )of O-2 and H-2 evolution was observed in absence of any sacrificial agent.

For the generally proposed adsorbate evolution route, the universal scaling relation between the adsorption energies of *OOH and *OH leads to an OER efficiency limitation based on the "volcano curve". A possible solution to bypass the scaling relation is to avoid the formation of the *OOH intermediate in the OER with the participation of lattice oxygen from catalysts. In this work, the lattice oxygen in (Bi0.5Co0.5)(2)O(3)is activated through adjusting the Fermi energy level and the strong overlap between Co 3d and O 2p, by means of increasing the oxygen vacancy concentration. Compared to oxygen-vacancy-poor (Bi0.5Co0.5)(2)O-3, the oxygen-vacancy-rich (Bi0.5Co0.5)(2)O(3)exhibits a significantly lower Tafel slope (43 mV dec(-1)), 15 times higher mass activity, 18 times higher turnover frequency, and excellent long-term stability in alkaline media, superior to those of the benchmark OER electrocatalyst IrO2. This work provides a feasible strategy to activate lattice oxygen with fast OER kinetics and puts forward the development of efficient and stable catalysts towards water oxidation.									23	1	0	0	0	0	23			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000546391600022

However, if Pb(II) ions are present as an impurity in the electrolyte, the oxidation of Pb(II) ions occurs as an anodic side reaction, leading to deposition of PbO(2)onto the conventional anodes. Herein, we prepared IrO2-Ta2O5/Ti anodes by thermal decomposition at the low temperature of 380 degrees C and investigated their crystallographic structure, surface morphology, and polarization behaviors for oxygen evolution as well as their suppression effect for anodic PbO(2)deposition in sulfuric acid/lead sulfate solutions. SEM observations with low accelerated incident electrons revealed that the nano/amorphous hybrid structure consisting of nanosized IrO(2)particles highly dispersed in the amorphous Ta(2)O(5)matrix can be prepared at 380 degrees C. Oxygen evolution was accelerated with an increasing Ir ratio in the anodes prepared at 380 degrees C in sulfuric acid solutions. Anodic PbO(2)deposition on the anodes prepared at 380 degrees C in lead sulfate solutions, which assumed the conditions of practical use, was completely suppressed.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0013-4651	1945-7111		WOS:000576931200001

One of the best-performing catalysts reported to date is nickel oxyhydroxide (NiOOH). However, during operating conditions, NiOOH has varying hydrogen content. To understand how hydrogen vacancies affect catalytic efficiency, we use density functional theory + calculations that model oxygen evolution reaction catalysis for NiOOH with hydrogen vacancies. Our calculations reveal that these defects destabilize the surface by altering local oxidation states and therefore reduce the overpotential. Our results agree with a very recent experiment that shows enhanced OER activity of NiOOH upon deprotonation.									38	1	0	0	0	0	39			1932-7447			WOS:000387737900026

Here, Co9-xFexS8/Co,Fe-N-C hybrids wrapped by reduced graphene oxide (rGO) (abbreviated as S-Co9-xFexS8@rGO) are synthesized through a semivulcanization and calcination method using graphene oxide (GO) wrapped bimetallic zeolite imidazolate framework (ZIF) Co,Fe-ZIF (CoFe-ZIF@GO) as precursors. Benefiting from the synergistic effect of OER active CoFeS and ORR active Co,Fe-N-C in a single component, as well as high dispersity and enhanced conductivity derived from rGO coating and Fe-doping, the obtained S-Co9-xFexS8@rGO-10 catalyst shows an ultrasmall overpotential of approximate to 0.29 V at 10 mA cm(-2) in OER and a half-wave potential of 0.84 V in ORR, combining a superior oxygen electrode activity of approximate to 0.68 V in 0.1 M KOH.									104	6	0	0	2	0	105			1613-6810	1613-6829		WOS:000426872300014	29318748

In particular, only a few OER electrocatalysts, such as expensive and scarce iridium (Ir)-based materials, have been developed to function in acidic media. Therefore, the exploration of efficient and stable electrocatalysts with decreased precious metal content for the OER in acid is desired. Herein, chromium (Cr)-incorporated IrOx solid solution nanowires not only exhibit high catalytic activity with a low overpotential of 250 mV at 10 mA cm(-2), but also display robust catalytic performance without a decay in activity throughout 25 h of testing at 10 mA cm(-2) in 0.5 M H2SO4. This improved catalytic performance for the Cr-incorporated IrOx electrocatalysts is ascribed to an abundance of exposed active sites, tuned electronic states, optimized binding energy for intermediates on the catalyst surface and the consequent facile reaction kinetics.									27	1	0	0	1	0	28			1867-3880	1867-3899		WOS:000499783200001

Herein, a series of Co-N doped bi-functional hierarchical porous electrocatalysts were synthesized using polyvinyl pyrrolidone (PVP) as soft template to assist the Zn/Co bimetal Zeolitic Imidazolate Framework (BMZIF) to form micro-/mesoporous carbon nanospheres via a convenient one-step solution synthesis method, followed by pyrolysis to form carbon nanospheres catalysts. The as-prepared Co/N co-doped carbon exhibits outstanding performances in the ORR and OER due to the formed hierarchical pores architecture and the high surface area.

Comparative Study of Ru-Transition Metal Alloys and Oxides as Oxygen Evolution Reaction Electrocatalysts in Alkaline Media								ACS APPLIED ENERGY MATERIALS											10.1021/acsaem.2c01545		SEP 2022			2022	The oxygen evolution reaction (OER), as the anodic reaction in water electrolyzers, generally exhibits much higher overpotentials than the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and thus requires the development of more active, robust, and stable electrocatalysts. In this work, a series of carbon-supported Ru-M alloy nanoparticles (M = Ir, Co, Ni, and Fe), transition metal (TM)-doped RuO2 nanoparticles such as Ru1-xMnxO2, Ru1-xCoxO(2), Ru1-x-yMnxCoyO(2), Ru1-xFexO2, Ru1-xNixO2, and Ru1-xVxO2/C, as well as RuO2, MnO2, Co3O4, and Co3-xMnxO4 nanoparticles have been synthesized with comparable nanoparticle sizes and compared for their OER intrinsic activities in alkaline media. All studied Ru-M alloy nanoparticles exhibited higher OER activity than pure Ru nanoparticles, and among them, Ru1-xIrx/C (x = 0.3-1) catalysts were found to be the most active. All studied Ru-TM oxide nanoparticles exhibited higher OER activity than the corresponding Ru-TM alloy nanoparticles with 30-50 atom % Co-doped RuO2/C catalysts being the most active. The OER enhancement on Ru-TM oxides is ascribed to the weaker O adsorption to their surfaces relative to the respective Ru-TM alloys. Small amounts of Mn (<= 0.15 atom %)-doped RuO2 nanoparticles also slightly enhanced the OER kinetics. In contrast to Co and Mn, Ni-, Fe-, and V-doped RuO(2 )nanoparticles inhibited the OER. Among Ru-TM oxide nanoparticles, Ru0.7Co0.3O2/C and Ru(0.85)Mn(0.1)5O(2)/C represent promising bifunctional catalysts for both the OER and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR).									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2574-0962			WOS:000854482400001

The greatest challenge is to develop a cost-effective strategy for hydrogen generation. Water electrolysis driven by renewable resource-derived electricity and direct solar-to-hydrogen conversion are promising pathways for sustainable hydrogen production. All of these techniques require highly active noble metal-free hydrogen and oxygen evolution catalysts to make the water splitting process energy efficient and economical. In this review, we highlight recent research efforts toward synthesis and performance optimization of noble metal-free electrocatalysts in our institute over the last 3 years. We focus on (1) hydrogen evolution catalysts, including transition metal phosphide, sulfides, selenides, and carbides; (2) oxygen evolution catalysts, including transition metal phosphide, sulfide, and oxide/hydroxides; and (3) bifunctional catalysts, mainly comprising transition metal phosphides, selenides, sulfides, and so on. Finally, we summarize the challenges and prospective for future development of non-noble metal catalysts for water electrolysis.									25	21	0	0	1	0	37			1000-6818			WOS:000384081400004

The unique composite morphology of IT-CCBC not only enhances the charge transport property by providing rapid electron-conduction pathway but also facilitates in diffusion of hydroxyl and oxygen reactants through the highly porous framework. Confirmed by electrochemical half-cell testing, IT-CCBC in fact exhibits very strong synergy between LaNiO3 NP and NCNT demonstrating bifunctionality with significantly improved catalytic activities of oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Furthermore, when compared to the state-of-art catalysts, IT-CCBC outperforms Pt/C and Ir/C in terms of ORR and OER, respectively, and shows improved electrochemical stability compared to them after cycle degradation testing. The practicality of the catalyst is corroborated by testing in a realistic rechargeable zinc-air battery utilizing atmospheric air in ambient conditions, where IT-CCBC demonstrates superior charge and discharge voltages and long-term cycle stability with virtually no battery voltage fading. These improved electrochemical properties of the catalyst are attributed to the nanosized dimensions of LaNiO3 NP controlled by simple hydrothermal technique, which enables prolific growth of and encapsulation by highly porous NCNT network. The excellent electrochemical results presented in this study highlight IT-CCBC as highly efficient and commercially viable bifunctional catalyst for rechargeable metal-air battery applications.									142	5	0	0	4	0	142			1944-8244			WOS:000348085200108	25494945

The as-synthesized Co3O4 catalyst can improve the electrocatalytic activity towards oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). The as-prepared catalyst exhibits the superior ORR/OER stability for which the relative current decays only 7% and 14% for OER and ORR, respectively. By contrast, the OER stability of the RuO2 catalyst presents the significant decay in relative current about 20%. The ORR stability of Pt/C also remarkably decreases to 29%.

However, the development of nonprecious metal catalysts with comparable activities to noble metals is still challenging. Here we report a one-step wet-chemical synthesis of Ni-/Mn-promoted mesoporous cobalt oxides through an inverse micelle process. Various characterization techniques including powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD), N-2 sorption, transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) confirm the successful incorporation of Ni and Mn leading to the formation of Co-Ni(Mn)-O solid solutions with retained mesoporosity. Among these catalysts, cobalt oxide with 5% Ni doping demonstrates promising activities for both ORR and OER, with an overpotential of 399 mV for ORR (at -3 mA/cm(2)) and 381 mV (at 10 mA/cm(2)) for OER. Furthermore, it shows better durability than precious metals featuring little activity decay throughout 24 h continuous operation. Analyses of cyclic voltammetry (CV), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), Raman, and O-2-temperature-programmed desorption (O-2-TPD) reveal that redox activity of Co3+ to Co4+ is crucial for OER performance, while the population of surface oxygen vacancies and surface area determine ORR activities. The comprehensive investigation of the intrinsic active sites for ORR and OER by correlating different physicochemical properties to the electrochemical activities is believed to provide important insight toward the rational design of high-performance electrocatalysts for ORR and OER reactions.									147	9	0	0	3	0	148			1944-8244			WOS:000381715900034	27458646

The use of Ni/based composites instead of pure Ni is one of the ways for improving the electrocatalytic activity of Ni electrode material. In this work, composite Ni/Co3O4 layers were electrodeposited from a conventional Watts' electrolyte containing Co3O4 powder, and their electrochemical properties towards hydrogen evolution reaction were investigated and compared with pure Ni layers under the same conditions. The composite electrodes are characterized by enhanced electrochemical activity with respect to hydrogen evolution reaction in an alkaline electrolyte: they feature a higher hydrogen evolution rate, as well as a lower overpotential as compared with pure Ni electrodes. The composite Ni/Co3O4 electrodes also show higher catalytic activity towards oxygen evolution reaction, which makes them perspective for application not only in alkaline electrolyzers for hydrogen production, but also for oxygen production or as electrodes in fuel cells.					15th International Symposium on Advanced Semiconductor-On-Insulator Technology and Related Physics/219th Meeting of the Electrochemical-Society/Symposium on Electrodeposition for Energy Applications 215th International Symposium on Advanced Semiconductor-On-Insulator Technology and Related Physics/219th Meeting of the Electrochemical-Society/Symposium on Electrodeposition for Energy Applications 2	MAY 01-06, 2011MAY 01-06, 2011	Electrochem Soc (ECS); Electrochem Soc (ECS), Elect & Photon Div; Electrodeposit; Energy TechnolElectrochem Soc (ECS); Electrochem Soc (ECS), Elect & Photon Div; Electrodeposit; Energy Technol	Montreal, CANADAMontreal, CANADA	4	0	0	0	0	0	4			1938-5862	1938-6737	978-1-60768-281-3; 978-1-56677-923-4	WOS:000300767200009

In this paper, we successfully construct Ru-incorporated oxygen-vacancy-enriched MoO2 nanosheets (Ru/MoO2_x) for the HER through a "one stone two birds " strategy. This strategy can solve two urgent problems simultaneously, the intrinsic electrochemical activity of original MoO2 is far from satisfactory and the H2O adsorption/dissociation abilities of Ru are weak. Specifically, the oxygen-vacancy-enriched MoO3 serves as an excellent platform for anchoring and trapping Ru ions. In-depth analyses indicate that the incorporation of Ru nanoclusters induces transition from MoO3 to MoO2, generates oxygen vacancies, and creates Ru-O-Mo sites. The synergistic effect of Ru nanoclusters, Ru-O-Mo sites and oxygen-vacancy-enriched MoO2 will endow the obtained catalyst excellent electrocatalytic activity. In particular, the optimal Ru/MoO2_x electrocatalyst delivered a low overpotential of 29 mV at 10 mA cm(_2) in a basic electrolyte.									15	0	0	0	1	0	15			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000787898800002

RuO2 is the most active material for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in electrolysers aiming at producing 'green' hydrogen, however it encounters critical electrochemical oxidation and dissolution issues during reaction. It remains a grand challenge to achieve stable and active RuO2 electrocatalyst as the current strategies usually enhance one of the two properties at the expense of the other. Here, we report breaking the stability and activity limits of RuO2 in neutral and alkaline environments by constructing a RuO2/CoOx interface. We demonstrate that RuO2 can be greatly stabilized on the CoOx substrate to exceed the Pourbaix stability limit of bulk RuO2. This is realized by the preferential oxidation of CoOx during OER and the electron gain of RuO2 through the interface. Besides, a highly active Ru/Co dual-atom site can be generated around the RuO2/CoOx interface to synergistically adsorb the oxygen intermediates, leading to a favourable reaction path. The as-designed RuO2/CoOx catalyst provides an avenue to achieve stable and active materials for sustainable electrochemical energy technologies.RuO2 encounters critical electrochemical dissolution issues during oxygen evolution reaction and it remains a grand challenge to achieve stable and active RuO2 electrocatalyst. Here, the authors report breaking stability and activity limits of RuO2 by constructing a RuO2/CoOx interface.									1	0	0	0	1	0	1				2041-1723		WOS:000854793700006	36114207

Herein, we report a facile in-situ electrochemical self-optimization strategy to produce carbon-fiber-supported defective CoOx (E-CoOx/CF), in which the partial self-dissolution of acidic oxides under alkaline OER operational conditions and releasing of in-situ generated oxygen molecules are taken as advantages for reconstruction of Co species with abundant defects, Co2+ and oxygen vacancies. The resultant E-CoOx/CF can achieve 10 mA cm(-2) at a low overpotential of 249 mV with a remarkable stability (> 100 h without performance decay). Moreover, this electrochemical etching method can also be extended to the preparation of highly active transition metal nickel oxides for enhanced OER. This study represents a new yet efficient strategy for rationally designing and developing advanced transition metal oxides for various electrochemical applications and beyond.									64	1	0	0	6	0	64			2211-2855	2211-3282		WOS:000461433600088

NiFe materials appeared as interesting catalytic materials for this reaction in alkaline electrolyzers and have been studied, particularly in the form of NiFe Layered Double Hydroxides (LDH). However, the impact of the specificity of the atomic arrangement in the LDH and of its composition on the catalytic efficiency of the material are still unknown. Herein, LDH are synthesized with Ni/Fe ratios from 2 to 4 and different levels of crystallinity to assess their electrocatalytic behavior in 0.1 M KOH. Statistical analysis of the electrochemical results allows to highlight that, while no effect from the atomic ratio is observed, an increase in the crystallinity of the LDH seem detrimental to the catalytic efficiency.

J	Pan, Kefeng; Zhai, Yingying; Zhang, Jiawei; Yu, Kai								FeS2/C Nanowires as an Effective Catalyst for Oxygen Evolution Reaction by Electrolytic Water Splitting								MATERIALS				12	20					3364	10.3390/ma12203364				OCT 2019	2019	Electrolytic water splitting with evolution of both hydrogen (HER) and oxygen (OER) is an attractive way to produce clean energy hydrogen. It is critical to explore effective, but low-cost electrocatalysts for the evolution of oxygen (OER) owing to its sluggish kinetics for practical applications. Fe-based catalysts have advantages over Ni- and Co-based materials because of low costs, abundance of raw materials, and environmental issues. However, their inefficiency as OER catalysts has caused them to receive little attention. Herein, the FeS2/C catalyst with porous nanostructure was synthesized with rational design via the in situ electrochemical activation method, which serves as a good catalytic reaction in the OER process. The FeS2/C catalyst delivers overpotential values of only 291 mV and 338 mV current densities of 10 mA/cm(2) and 50 mA/cm(2), respectively, after electrochemical activation, and exhibits staying power for 15 h.									11	0	0	0	0	0	11				1996-1944		WOS:000498402100087	31618909

Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) and their derivatives have been extensively applied to design and synthesize nanostructures and nanomaterials with high catalytic activities in various electrochemical reactions. However, there are few literatures reviewing corresponding progress in using MOFs and derivative to prepare noble metal-based electrocatalysts. Thus, in this review, a concise and lucid introduction of this field is provided. We mainly introduce different synthetic methods that emerged in representative achievements and discuss the roles of MOFs and their derivatives. The existing problems and future perspectives toward the design of diversified noble metal-based electrocatalysts via this approach are addressed at the end.

Thus, urge the development of clean and renewable energy sources such as based on solar energy and water in a cyclic way, by photoinduced water-splitting and regeneration in fuel cells. In this context, energy storage devices such as hybrid supercapacitors become fundamental for realization of a sustainable society. In this review, the early discovery and recent advances concerning synthetic strategies, hierarchical structures, and oxygen evolution reaction (OER)/hydrogen evolution reactions (HER) catalytic performances of nickel-vanadium double hydroxides (NiV-LDHs) based nanomaterials are summarized. A discussion about the role of vanadium ions in HER/OER was also included, highlighting the recent progress in theoretical calculations in this field. Finally, some hybrid supercapacitor electrode materials based on NiV-LDHs are described, including the strategies to circumvent the parasitic oxygen evolution reaction during charge-discharge of those energy storage devices. In short, catalysts for HER/OER and hybrid supercapacitor electrode materials based on NiV-LDHs were reviewed considering their key multifunctional role in the way to a more sustainable society.(c) 2020 Science Press and Dalian Institute of Chemical Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences.

Graphene-supported single-atom catalysts (SACs) have been widely explored; however, either experiments or density functional theory (DFT) computations cannot screen catalysts at high speed. Herein, based on DFT computations of 104 graphene-supported SACs (M@C-3, M@C-4, M@pyridine-N-4, and M@pyrrole-N-4), we built machine learning (ML) models to describe the underlying pattern of easily obtainable physical properties and limiting potentials (mean square errors = 0.027/0.021/0.035 V for the ORR/OER/HER, respectively) and employed these models to predict the catalytic performance of 260 other graphene-supported SACs containing metal-NxCy active sites (M@NxCy). We recomputed the top catalysts recommended by ML towards the ORR/OER/HER by DFT, which confirmed the reliability of our ML model, and identified two OER catalysts (Ir@pyridine-N3C1 and Ir@pyridine-N2C2) outperforming noble metal oxides, RuO2 and IrO2. The ML models quantitatively unveiled the significance of various descriptors and quickly narrowed down the candidate list of graphene-supported single-atom catalysts. This approach can be easily used to screen and design other SACs and significantly accelerate the catalyst design for many other important reactions.									50	3	0	0	1	0	49			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000521109000025

Herein, we prepared a series of Fe/Ni-based trimetallic MOFs (Fe/Ni/Co(Mn)-MIL-53 accordingly to the Material of Institute Lavoisier) by solvothermal synthesis, which can be directly adopted as highly efficient electrocatalysts. The Fe/Ni/Co(Mn)-MIL-53 shows a volcano-type oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity as a function of compositions. The optimized Fe/Ni-2.4/Co-0.4-MIL-53 can reach a current density of 20 mA cm(-2) at low overpotential of 236 mV with a small Tafel slope of 52.2 mV dec(-1). In addition, the OER performance of these MOFs can be further enhanced by directly being grown on nickel foam (NF).									444	21	0	0	15	0	447			1433-7851	1521-3773		WOS:000424212300023	29155461

The IrO2:F thin film on Ti foil has been studied as a promising oxygen evolution anode electrocatalyst for proton exchange membrane (PEM) based water electrolysis. Studies reveal that F-doped IrO2 with different F content displays remarkably higher electrochemical activity and comparable electrochemical durability in contrast to pure undoped IrO2 electrocatalyst. Specifically, thin film IrO2:F with 20 wt.% F shows similar to 19% higher electrocatalytic activity and comparable durability compared to pure IrO2 clearly suggesting that F-doped IrO2 is a better anode and a more efficient electrocatalyst for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in PEM based water electrolysis.

We demonstrated that the electron transfer (delta) from CoTa2O6 to graphene substrate can be utilized to boost the reactivity of Co-site, leading to an OER overpotential as low as 0.30 V when N-doped graphene is employed.

Although palmeirite oxide A(2)Mo(3)O(8) as OER catalyst has been explored, the correlation between its active sites (tetrahedral or octahedral) and OER performance has been elusive. Now, magnetic Co2Mo3O8@NC-800 composed of highly crystallized Co2Mo3O8 nanosheets and ultrathin N-rich carbon layer is shown to be an efficient OER catalyst. The catalyst exhibits favorable performance with an overpotential of 331 mV@10 mA cm(-2) and 422 mV@40 mA cm(-2), and a full water-splitting electrolyzer with it as anode catalyst shows a cell voltage of 1.67 V@10 mA cm(-2) in alkaline. Combined HAADFSTEM, magnetic, and computational results show that factors influencing the OER performance can be attributed to the tetrahedral Co sites (high spin, t(2)(3)e(4)), which improve the OER kinetics of rate-determining step to form *OOH.									120	14	0	0	2	0	123			1433-7851	1521-3773		WOS:000533305300001	32337761

The as-synthesized Ni0.85Se films supported on graphite substrate exhibited excellent activities for both hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER). It needs over potentials of 200 and 302 mV to drive 10 mA cm(-2) for HER and OER in 1.0 M NaOH, respectively, and shows competitive activity among non-noble electrocatalysts with strong durability. The marvellous performance of cost-effective Ni0.85Se in HER and OER enables it to serve as competitive bifunctional electrode in alkaline water electrolyzer.

The goethite-catalyzed decomposition of unstabilized hydrogen peroxide formulations resulted in more rapid hydrogen peroxide loss and oxygen evolution relative to systems containing a highly stabilized hydrogen peroxide formulation. Systems at neutral pH and those containing higher goethite concentrations were characterized by higher rates of hydrogen peroxide decomposition and by more oxygen evolution. The stabilized hydrogen peroxide formulation showed greater hydroxyl radical production relative to the unstabilized formulations. Furthermore, hydroxyl radical production rates were greater at neutral pH than at the acidic pH regimes. The results suggest that when stabilized hydrogen peroxide is injected into the subsurface during in situ bioremediation, naturally occurring minerals such as goethite may initiate Fenton-like reactions. While these reactions may prove to be toxic to microorganisms, they have the potential to chemically oxidize contaminants in soils and groundwater. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V.

The high charge overpotentials of the cathodic oxygen evolution reaction of insulator lithium peroxide is one of the critical challenges for practical implementation of lithium-oxygen batteries, which results in low energy efficiency and poor stability of cathodes and electrolytes. Transition metal oxides are known to be the most active electrocatalysts that can dramatically decrease the charging overpotentials of rechargeable lithium-air batteries. However, the poor electrical conductivity of these oxide electrocatalysts, such as RuO2, MnO2 and Co3O4, limits the charge transport of cathodic reactions and the full utilization of their catalytic activities. Herein, we exploit the high oxygen evolution reaction activities of oxides by incorporating insulator oxides into the pore channels of highly conductive nanoporous gold to form three-dimensional nanoporous core-shell composites. The hybrid catalysts as the cathodes of rechargeable lithium-oxygen batteries show highly reversible cathodic reactions at extremely lower overpotentials for high efficiency lithium-air batteries, arising from the synergistic effect of high conductive nanoporous gold (NPG) and catalytically active metal oxides.									39	4	0	0	2	0	39			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000349447200048

Compared with atomically dispersed single Fe and Ni catalysts, the bimetallic FeNi catalysts exhibit outstanding performance for reversible OER and ORR, achieving a low potential gap (Delta E) of 0.81 V to deliver an OER current density of 10 mA cm(-2) and an ORR current density of 3 mA cm(-2). The FeNi electrodes also show a much better stability in the cyclic tests, compared to that of the state-of-the-art Pt/C and Pt/C+Ir/C electrodes for reversible OER and ORR. The high performance is likely due to the significantly enhanced OER activity contributed by the introduction of Ni atoms, forming bridged FeNi bimetallic dual atom active sites for OER. This study provides a new platform for the development of highly active bimetallic atomic catalysts based bifunctional electrocatalysts for metal-air batteries. The modified one-pot synthesis methods demonstrated in this study can also be applicable to other atomically dispersed catalysts on CNTs or graphenes.									38	3	0	0	2	0	38			2196-0216			WOS:000475512500032

However, most electrocatalysts require complex synthesis processes, which prohibit mass production. Herein, NiCoFeP nanofibers are synthesized by phosphating the electrospun Ni,Co precursor nanofibers and subsequent displacement reaction of Ni and Fe3+ via impregnation of Fe(NO3)(3) solution. The obtained NiCoFeP nanofibers catalyst possesses high intrinsic activity, abundant active sites, and superior kinetics, which shows excellent oxygen evolution reaction (OER) performance with low overpotential of 0.309V at 50mAcm(-2) in 1 m KOH solution. It also exhibits a long-term cycling performance for 200h at 10mAcm(-2) as the cathode for zinc-air battery. Furthermore, it is demonstrated that this displacement reaction method is also suitable for preparing other catalysts NiMnP and NiCuP to enhance their OER performance. This work presents a novel approach for the fabrication of multimetallic catalysts for electrocatalysis.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			2699-9412			WOS:000783857000006

Here, the pH gradient effect was determined by developing electrode reaction equations, considering the overpotential assigned to the pH gradient called pH overpotential. The pH gradient effect was revealed to involve two aspects: (1) the Nernst pH overpotential, accounting for the common Nernst relationship with pH, and (2) the pH-dependent function of the electron-transfer coefficient (alpha(pH)). Both parts were verified experimentally using oxygen reduction reaction and hydrogen evolution reaction, obviously, with different alpha(pH) functions. Detailed alpha(pH) function effect was clarified based on numerical calculations of the electrode reaction equations. We found that the effect could be assessed suitably by an apparent constant (alpha(app)) and a nonlinear fitting method proposed for alpha(app) value estimation. The results of this study provide the kinetic fundamentals of electrode reactions involving H+/OH- and contribute to the understanding and assessment of their performance with the H+/OH- transport effect.[GRAPHICS].									2	0	0	0	1	0	2				2096-5745		WOS:000794257100030

In this study, a tri-functional additives 1-methyl, 3-benzyl, 1H imidazolium bromide (IMPBr) is dissolved in the dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO)-based electrolyte to solve the problems of the slow dynamic process of ORR and OER, and protect the lithium anode by suppressing the dendrite formation in O-2 atmosphere. During discharging, IMP+ has a strong binding ability to the intermediate product O-2(-), and Br- is highly associated with Li+, helping drive the solvation mechanism. During charging, Br- mediates the decomposition of battery discharge products and reduces the charge over-potential. Meanwhile, the positively charged IMP+ can be attracted to the surface of the anode via electric attraction, in situ forming a stable SEI layer to prevent DMSO, Br-3(-), and Br-2 from attacking the lithium metal and growth of lithium dendrites. The synergy effect of the IMP+ and Br- improves the cycle and rate performance of the Li-O-2 battery.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			2405-8297	2405-8289		WOS:000797828900003

While nanostructure engineering has been a widely used strategy to enhance the performance of TMOs, it is still not well-understood whether the reaction kinetics remain the same after shrinking the material size to nanometers. Herein, we report a modulated reaction pathway on SrNb0.1Co0.7Fe0.2O3-delta (SNCF) by shrinking its size to nanometers, leading to strongly enhanced OER activity. SNCF nanofibers with different diameters were synthesized by the electrospinning approach. In comparison to the bulk reference sample, more oxygen vacancies were observed on the surface of SNCF nanofibers. These oxygen vacancies lead to a decoupled proton and electron transfer on the surface of SNCF nanofibers, as revealed by the combination of the pH dependence study and H/D isotopic labeling experiments. The knowledge obtained in this work can be applied to guide the design of highly active catalysts for other reactions for energy and environmental devices.									4	0	0	0	1	0	3			0887-0624	1520-5029		WOS:000692131800036

Wet electrolytic oxidation of organic sludge								JOURNAL OF HAZARDOUS MATERIALS				146	3	SI		646	651		10.1016/j.jhazmat.2007.04.107				JUL 31 2007	2007	Electrolysis of an aqueous solution at subcritical water conditions, referred here as wet electrolytic oxidation (WEO), results in a completely different reaction product compared to that from usual water electrolysis. Oxygen, hydrogen and chlorine evolution is almost completely suppressed when carrying out the electrolysis of aqueous NaCl solution at temperatures higher than 250 degrees C. Chemical oxygen demand (COD) compounds can be completely mineralized by this electrolytic reaction, but this work focused in partial oxidation of organic sludge and combining with biological process. The treatment of organic sludge by WEO increased the biodegradability of organic sludge due to the formation of organic acids. The electrochemical reaction of WEO suppressed the evolution of color that often appears in subcritical water treatment of organic waste. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V.

In this work, a series of Fe-Co-B nanosheets with different molar ratio of Fe/Co precursor have been recombined with bacterial cellulose based carbon nanofiber (BCCNF) through simple electroless deposition method at room temperature. It is indicated that, when the Fe/Co molar ratio is 1:3, Fe-Co-B/BCCNF exhibits an excellent catalytic property with overpotential of only 160 mV at 10 mA cm-2. Furthermore, it displays a prominent electrochemical stability, even over 30 h of OER process under alkaline condition.

Molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) has been extensively studied as a promising low-cost catalyst for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), whereas HER is only catalyzed at the edge for pristine MoS2, leaving a large area of basal plane useless. Herein, on-surface self-assembly is demonstrated to be an effective, facile, and damage-free method to take full advantage of the large ratio surface of MoS2 for HER by using multiscale simulations. It is found that as supplement of edge sites of MoS2, on-MoS2 M(abt)(2) (M = Ni, Co; abt = 2-aminobenzenethiolate) owns high HER activity, and the self-assembled M(abt)(2) monolayers on MoS2 can be obtained through a simple liquid-deposition method. More importantly, on-surface self-assembly provides potential application for overall water splitting once the self-assembled systems prove to be of both HER and oxygen evolution reaction activities, for example, on-MoS2 Co(abt)(2). This work opens up a new and promising avenue (on-surface self-assembly) toward the full exploitation of the basal plane of MoS2 for HER and the preparation of bifunctional catalysts for overall water splitting.									42	2	0	0	1	0	42				2198-3844		WOS:000418385800007	29270345

Here, two trifunctional catalysts based on M (Co, Ni), N and S tridoped carbon nanoplates (Co/N/S-CNPs and Ni/N/S-CNPs) are reported. Due to the relatively higher catalytic site content, graphitization degree and smaller charge-transfer resistance, the Co/N/S-CNPs catalyst shows higher activity and stability for ORR (onset potential of 0.99 V and half-wave potential of 0.87 V us. RHE (reversible hydrogen electrode)), OER (overpotential at 10 mA cm(-2) of 0.37 V) and HER than the Ni/N/S-CNPs catalyst. Furthermore, when constructed with the Co/N/S-CNPs and commercial 20 wt% Pt/C + Ir/C cathodes, respectively, Zn-air battery (ZnAB) based on the Co/N/S-CNPs cathode displays better performance, including a higher power density of 96.0 mW cm(-2) and cycling stability at 5 mA cm(-2). In addition, an alkaline electrolyzer assembled with the Co/N/S-CNPs catalyst as a bifunctional catalyst can reach 10 mA cm(-2) at 1.65 V for overall water splitting and maintain excellent stability even after cycling for 12 h. The present work proves the potential of the Co/N/S-CNPs catalyst for many clean energy devices. (C) 2018 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

The optimum pH for oxygen evolution in mixed whole saliva was around 8. Oxygen evolution was also observed in dialysed saliva, suggesting that free SCN- is not essential. The optimum pH was around pH 6. Sodium thiocyanate inhibited the oxygen evolution under acidic conditions in dialysed saliva, increasing the K-m of hydrogen peroxide and decreasing the V-max. Ferric chloride (1 mM), a chelator of SCN-, also inhibited oxygen evolution in dialysed saliva; activity was completely restored by 10 mM sodium citrate. Under alkaline conditions, NaSCN slightly enhanced the oxygen evolution without affecting the K-m of hydrogen peroxide but increasing the V-max. Hydrogen peroxide-induced oxidation of SCN- in dialysed saliva was much faster at pH 5 than pH 8. These findings suggest that a function of peroxidase in stimulated saliva where the pH is typically between 7 and 8 is the scavenging of hydrogen peroxide to produce molecular oxygen but without producing OSCN- plus HOSCN.

At present, only some noble-metal oxide materials (IrO2 and RuO2) have been reported as efficient OER electrocatalysts for OER. However, the high cost and scarcity of these noble-metal oxide materials greatly hamper their large-scale practical application. Herein, we synthesize 100% (111) faceted NiFe2O4 single crystals with multiple vacancies (cation vacancies and O vacancies). The (111) facets can supply enough platform to break chemical bonds and enhance electrocatalytic activity, due to its high density of atomic steps and kink atoms. Compared to NiFe2O4 (without vacancies), the as-synthesized NiFe2O4-Ar (with vacancies) exhibits a dramatically improved OER activity. The NiFe2O4-Ar-30 shows the lowest onset potential (1.45 V vs RHE) and the best electrocatalytic OER activity with the lowest overpotential of 234 mV at 50 mA cm(-2). Furthermore, based on the theoretical calculations that the introduction of multiple vacancies can effectively modulate the electronic structure of active centers to accelerate charge transfer and reaction intermediates adsorption, which can reduce the reaction energy barrier and enhance the activity of electrochemical OER.									13	0	0	0	0	0	13			1861-4728	1861-471X		WOS:000585920400001	32497378

Electronic interactions between these catalysts and chemical reactants control the activity and efficiency and hence need to be optimized, but only the cation components have been of interest. Here, through the optimization of both the cation and anion components, we demonstrate that a Ruddlesden-Popper-type oxychloride Sr2Co0.8Fe0.2O3Cl successfully outperforms Ba0.5Sr0.5Co0.8Fe0.2O3-delta, which is a well-known highly active OER catalyst. Moreover, Sr2Co0.8Fe0.2O3Cl also catalyzes the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and minimizes the overpotentials of both the ORR and OER, compared with previously reported conventional perovskite-type catalysts. We discuss possible descriptors of the catalytic activity of Sr2Co0.8Fe0.2O3Cl to clarify the origin of its activity and highlight a new reaction pathway for OER that involves catalysis by both Co and Fe.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			0897-4756	1520-5002		WOS:000580949200013

Morphologies and structures of as-prepared films were characterized by different methods. Results show that ordered oxygen vacancies was observed in hematite nanobelts with a periodicity of 1.48 nm corresponding to ten times of (11 (2) over bar) interplanar spacing. The PEC performance of the hematite nanobelts exhibits stable photocurrent density of 3.3 mA center dot cm(-2), the corresponding hydrogen evolution rate of 29.46 mu mol center dot cm(-2)center dot h(-1), and an early onset potential of 0.587 V (vs. RHE) without additional oxygen evolution reaction cocatalysts. The enhanced performance can be attributed to the introduced ordered oxygen vacancies which can increase the carrier density, greatly accelerate the surface holes transfer, and act as surface active sites to significantly promote the surface water oxidation reaction.									4	0	0	0	1	0	4			1000-324X			WOS:000722149600008

Herein, it is demonstrated that the electrocatalytic OER performance of CoP can be greatly improved by constructing a hybrid CoP/TiOx heterostructure. The CoP/TiOx heterostructure is fabricated using metal-organic framework nanocrystals as templates, which leads to unique hollow structures and uniformly distributed CoP nanoparticles on TiOx. The strong interactions between CoP and TiOx in the CoP/TiOx heterostructure and the conductive nature of TiOx with Ti3+ sites endow the CoP-TiOx hybrid material with high OER activity comparable to the state-of-the-art IrO2 or RuO2 OER electrocatalysts. In combination with theoretical calculations, this work reveals that the formation of CoP/TiOx heterostructure can generate a pathway for facile electron transport and optimize the water adsorption energy, thus promoting the OER electrocatalysis.									79	2	0	0	3	0	79			1613-6810	1613-6829		WOS:000501277800001	31814261

Herein, a facile and ultrafast interfacial reaction was performed on n-Si/Ni for stable and high-performance Si photoanode by regulating both the Ni electrocatalyst and Si surface. The calculated and experimental results reveal that highly catalytic oxygen vacancies-rich Fe:NiOOH layer will be formed on Ni surface during the hot Fe ions exchange reaction, which can create abundant active sites for oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The interfacial reaction also can modulate the interfacial state of Si photoanode to increase barrier height for n-Si/Ni/Fe:NiOOH photoanode, thereby accelerating the charge separation and transportation. More significantly, a thin iron silicide (FeSi2) layer will be generated on Si surface (Ni-free region), which is beneficial for the stability of Si photoanode. This work provides a low-cost and straightforward approach to design high-performance Si photoanodes by interface engineering and electrocatalyst defects regulation.									8	0	0	0	2	0	8			2211-2855	2211-3282		WOS:000521052900084

Aiming at enhancement of oxygen electrode kinetics and durability, composite support materials for iridium oxide are synthesized via in situ phosphorization reaction on tin doped indium oxide and possess functionalities of high electronic and intrinsic proton conductivity. At 130 degC under a water vapor atmosphere an overall conductivity of 0.72 S cm-1 is achieved with a contribution of around 10-2 S cm-1 proton conductivity. The support structure of three-dimensionally ordered hexagonal arrays displays a high specific surface area of 180 m2 g-1. Benefiting from the mixed conductivities and porous structure in the composite support materials, the supported IrO2 catalysts exhibit about five times enhancement of the OER activity in acidic electrolytes. The improved catalytic performance for the OER was further confirmed by PEM electrolyzer tests at 130 degC. A test of such a steam electrolyzer cell at 350 mA cm-2 shows good durability within a period of up to 1150 hours.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			1754-5692			INSPEC:15010345

In this study, bacterial-cellulose-derived carbon nanofiber-supported CoFe2O4 (CFO/CNF) has been prepared via a facile and green method. The three dimensional (3D) interconnected CNF network support with high surface area not only provides high electronic conductivity but also promotes the mass transfer of O-2 and electrolyte during the ORR and OER. Furthermore, the strong coupling between CFO and CNF allows for fast charge transfer, facilitating the electrocataltyic processes. These lead to the high electrocatalytic activity of as-prepared CFO/CNF nanocomposite toward both the ORR and OER, outperforming CFO and CNF, respectively. Meanwhile, the stability of CFO/CNF nanocomposite toward the ORR and OER is much higher than that of benchmark Pt/C (20 wt.%) and RuO2/C (20 wt.%), respectively.

Herein, for the first time, the asymmetric zigzag structure of {111} faceted Ni3S2 is elucidated, which is predicted by DFT calculation to have high electrocatalytic activity for both the hydrogen evolution reaction and oxygen evolution reaction. Such Ni3S2 nanostructures are then in situ fabricated on a robust 3D scaffold via a one-step hydrothermal treatment of porous Ni foam in a Na2S aqueous solution, which effectively avoids the hydrogen brittleness of the Ni foam skeletons and guarantees the robustness of the 3D scaffold. As expected, the as-prepared Ni3S2 exhibits appealing catalytic performance for both the hydrogen evolution reaction (eta = 189 mV at j = 10 mA cm(-2) with a Tafel slope of 89.3 mV dec(-1)) and oxygen evolution reaction (eta = 296 mV at j = 10 mA cm(-2) with a Tafel slope of 65.1 mV dec(-1)), which is comparable to that of the commercial noble-metal-based catalyst Pt/C and better than that of the commercial catalyst IrO2. The self-supported Ni3S2 electrodes are further used for overall water-splitting, demonstrating high efficiency and durable stability. This work will provide new insights for tailoring crystallographic facets and fabricating advanced energy materials.									45	2	0	0	3	0	45			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000477988200028

Additionally, the synthesis of materials that can exhibit more than one electrocatalytic reaction is notable. In this work, stepwise electrodeposited nickel-iron hydroxide nanoarrays are investigated as anode electrocatalysts with enhanced performance towards the oxidation of water, urea, and hydrazine. The stepwise electrodeposited nickel-iron hydroxide (NiFe(OH)(2)-SD/NF) electrodes show excellent electrocatalytic activity and stability for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) with a low potential of 1.45 V (vs RHE) at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2). These electrodes further display excellent catalytic activity towards the urea oxidation reaction (UOR) and hydrazine oxidation reaction (HzOR) with potentials lower than 1.32 V (vs RHE) and 0.06 V (vs RHE), respectively. Owing to synergistic effects, a porous structure for mass transport leads to excellent electrocatalytic performance. This non-precious-metal nickel-iron hydroxide, prepared by a simple synthesis approach, is promising for hybrid water electrolysis applications and the development of environmentally friendly clean energy reactions.

Experimental results show that operating temperature has a strong influence on the HER rate. In particular, compared with V3+ reduction reaction, HER is more sensitive to temperature variation. It is also found that, contrary to the conventional wisdom that side reactions occur at the late stage of the charge process, H-2 evolves at a relatively low SOC. About 0.26 and 1.94 mL H-2 were collected at an early (SOC lower than 20%) and end of the charge process, respectively, suggesting that attention to the hydrogen formation at the negative electrode in the early charge process should also be paid to during longterm battery operations. Moreover, the produced hydrogen gas at the negative side prefers to form macroscopically observable bubbles onto the electrode surface, covering the active sites for vanadium redox reactions, while oxygen evolution (including CO2 production) at the positive side corrodes electrode surface and introduces certain oxygen-containing functional groups.

Herein, based on light-induced electrochemistry, a laser-assisted, continuous, solution route for the simultaneous reduction and modification of graphene oxide with catalytic nanoparticles is reported. Electrochemical graphene oxide (EGO) is used as starting material and electron-hole pair source due to its low degree of oxidation, which imparts structural integrity and an ability to withstand photodegradation. Simply illuminating a solution stream containing EGO and metal salt (e.g., H2PtCl6 or RuCl3) with a 248 nm wavelength laser produces reduced EGO (rEGO, oxygen content 4.0 at%) flakes, decorated with Pt (~2.0 nm) or RuO2 (~2.8 nm) nanoparticles. The RuO2-rEGO flakes exhibit superior catalytic activity for the oxygen evolution reaction, requiring a small overpotential of 225 mV to reach a current density of 10 mA cm-2. The Pt-rEGO flakes (10.2 wt% of Pt) show enhanced mass activity for the hydrogen evolution reaction, and similar performance for oxygen reduction reaction compared to a commercial 20 wt% Pt/C catalyst. This simple production method is also used to deposit PtPd alloy and MnOx nanoparticles on rEGO, demonstrating its versatility in synthesizing functional nanoparticle-modified graphene materials.

In this work, boron doping into nickel-iron layered double hydroxide (NiFe LDH) was evaluated for the enhancement of OER electrocatalytic activity. To fabricate boron-doped NiFe LDH (B:NiFe LDH), gaseous boronization, a gas-solid reaction between boron gas and NiFe LDH, was conducted at a relatively low temperature. Subsequently, catalyst activation was performed through electrochemical oxidation for maximization of boron doping and improved OER performance. As a result, it was possible to obtain a remarkably reduced overpotential of 229 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) compared to that of pristine NiFe LDH (315 mV) due to the effect of facile charge-transfer resistance by boron doping and improved active sites by electrochemical oxidation.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3				2046-2069		WOS:000622073000043	35423321

The impact of electrochemical parameters in PRED on HER and OER activities is explored, indicating that changes in two activities of PRED dissolution step are opposite. An increase in dissolution amount during PRED enhances OER while decreasing HER activity. The Mott-Schottky analysis reveals that improvement in HER by adopting PRED is due to an increase in the reactivity of active sites. On the contrary, OER is enhanced due to the number of active sites on the surface of NiP films increased by the excess dissolution during PRED. Surface analyses suggest that the opposite response of HER and OER is caused by different factors; uniform formation of NiP governs HER activity while removability of phosphate determines the exposure of OER-active Ni oxide phases.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000787898900001

Here, an excellent OER catalyst of 2D ultrathin alpha-Co(OH)(2) nanosheets was synthesized via a reduction-oxidation strategy. The 2D ultrathin alpha-Co(OH)(2) nanosheets could effectively catalyse the OER in alkaline media with an overpotential of only 278 mV at 10 mA/cm(2) and a relatively small Tafel slope (77 mV/dec) as well as extraordinary stability, much greater than that of the alpha-Co(OH)(2) nanoflower and no-load Ni foam.

Herein, a facile and cost-effective strategy was employed to prepare the mesoporous nitrogen doped NiFe layered double hydroxide/reduced graphene oxide (NiFe-LDH/NrGO) nanospheres via an one-pot solvothermal reaction by using GO, protonated g-C3N4 nanosheets (p-CNNS), mixed metal salts and alkali as precursors in presence of surfactant. The doping of p-CNNS resulted in the superior ORR activity compared to pristine NiFe-LDH and NiFe-LDH/rGO. The ORR results demonstrated that the NiFe-LDH/NrGO hybrid involved a perfect 4e mechanism with better durability and methanol tolerance ability than commercial 20% Pt/C catalyst in 0.1 M KOH. NiFe-LDH/NrGO also displayed the excellent OER activity with a close onset over potential to NiFe-LDH/rGO, but a more negative overpotential and a higher current density at eta > 300 mV in the same alkaline medium. Overall, the outstanding catalytic performance toward both ORR and OER suggested that the NiFe-LDH/NrGO composite can be a new non-precious metal bifunctional catalyst in the related renewable energy fields.

Measurement of the time variation of catalytic current for oxygen evolution reaction in aqueous alkaline media provides a direct estimate of fractional conversion of the reactant in the course of the reaction for testing different reaction kinetic models. This methodology is applied to analyze the formation of monoclinic zirconia and praseodymia-doped zirconia from tetragonal precursors.

In this work, we reported the design and synthesis of oxygen vacancies engineered CoMoO4 nanosheet arrays grown on three-dimension (3D) porous Ni foam (NF) support by hydrothermal synthesis followed by reducing gas heat treatment used H-2 or NH3, and explored their practical application as bifunctional electrocatalysts for water splitting. The unique 3D nanosheet array can facilitate the interfacial electron transfer and ion transport, as well as promote hydrogen and oxygen gas diffusion, and the formation of oxygen vacancies in CoMoO4 nanosheets can significantly improve efficiency of both hydrogen evolution reaction and oxygen evolution reaction. When using as self-supported bifunctional electrocatalyst to make an electrolyzer, NF/H-CoMoO4 approached 10 mA cm(-2) under the cell voltages of 1.56 V, along with excellent durability in an alkaline water electrolyzer, which hold great promise in energy conversion application.

Herein, an advanced class of CoNi selenides containing rich oxygen vacancies, with a hierarchical bundle-like and holey nanosheets as noble-metal-free catalysts were first synthesized through a facile hydrothermal method. Benefitting from abundant oxygen vacancies, bundle-like nanostructure, as well as strong synergistic effects, such CoNi selenides demonstrate a greatly enhanced surface area to supply more electrocatalytic active sites to contact with electrolyte, accompanied by largely promoted reaction kinetics, which show outstanding electrocatalytic performances for OER. Remarkably, the optimal Co1Ni0.5Se can display outstanding OER activity with the small Tafel slope of 48 mV dec(-1) and low over potential of 250 mV (at 10 mA cm(-2)), which are much superior to those of Co/Ni-based catalysts. This electrocatalyst can also maintain high activity and structure stability during long-term electrolysis of 35 h, demonstrating a desirable electrocatalyst for OER.

Therefore, the development of cost-effective and visible-light-driven water splitting photo catalysts is highly desirable. Herein, the Co nanoparticles decorated with nitrogen doped carbon nanotubes (Co-NCNT-T, T = pyrolysis temperature) were rationally designed by a simple pyrolysis process at different temperature using for boosting photocatalytic oxygen evolution and hydrogen evolution. The results show that as-obtained Co-NCNT-800 exhibits a considerable hydrogen evolution rate of 14.7 mmol h(-1) g(-1) and oxygen yield of 51%. In addition, a turnover number (TON) of 25.8 and turnover frequency (TOF) of 0.86 s(-1) for water oxidation are attained under optimized conditions. The excellent activity is mainly ascribed to the effective electron transfer between the catalyst and photosensitizer, which is verified by photoluminescence (PL) spectra and transient photocurrent responses experiments. Overall, this work provides a novel strategy for expanding highly efficient water splitting catalysts.									28	2	0	0	1	0	28			2168-0485			WOS:000455288800186

The trimetallic spinel-type Co0.5Ni0.5Mn2O4 shows higher bifunctional electrocatalytic activity towards ORR and OER than bimetallic oxides such as CoMn2O4 and NiMn2O4. The insitu X-ray absorption spectroscopy was applied to observe the change in the oxidation number of Mn, Ni, and Co during the reactions to demonstrate the active metals on the ORR and OER. The Co plays a more important role in the ORR process than the Ni and Mn, while the three metals exhibit an equivalent contribution on the OER activity as observed from the oxidation state shift. Additionally, the practicality of Zn-air batteries using the trimetallic spinel catalyst is demonstrated to power light-emitting diode and spinning motor with a nominal voltage of 3V. Bifunctional trimetallic electrocatalysts in this work may be useful for other metal-air batteries.									7	0	0	0	0	0	7				2566-6223		WOS:000550061100008

We present a strategy for improving the bifunctional ORR/OER activity of supported FeCoOx nanoparticles by tuning the properties of multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNT) via nitrogen doping during their synthesis in the presence of ammonia and subsequent oxidative functionalization. In-depth structural characterization indicates that oxidative treatment provides fine control of the dispersion and localization of FeCoOx nanoparticles in MWCNT, while the optimal degree of nitrogen doping leads to increased bifunctional activity due to enhanced electrical conductivity as well as improved catalyst stability, in both OER and ORR conditions, for nanoparticles formed by two different synthesis routes. The findings reported can be strategically considered for the design of high-performance reversible ORR/OER electrocatalysts.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			2196-0216			WOS:000657201400001

Herein, the hierarchical heterostructure bifunctional electrocatalyst for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is fabricated by coupling NiCo-layered double hydroxide (NiCo-LDH) nanosheets with NiCoP nanotubes on Ni foam. The NiCo-layered double hydroxide (NiCo-LDH) nanosheets/NiCoP nanotubes/Ni foam exhibits excellent electrocatalytic performance in alkaline environment, which is determined by a low overpotential of 112 mV and 219 mV to reach 10 mA.cm(-2) for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER), respectively. The as-prepared electrocatalyst as the anode and cathode only requires a cell voltage of 1.54 V to afford 10 mA.cm(-2).

Carbon-supported nonprecious metals (C@NPMs) with variable metal sizes (single atom, cluster, and nanoparticle) are attracting significant interest for catalyzing these reactions. Therefore, a systematic summary of the recent advances in this field is necessary; however, C@NPMs have seldom been comprehensively reviewed. Herein, the most recent progress (in the years 2015-2020) of C@NPMs for ORR/OER/HER/CO2RR catalysis are reviewed. The review begins with the introduction of various synthesis methods for C@NPMs. Next, promising design strategies to modulate the electrochemical properties of C@NPMs are elaborated, including defect engineering, porosity fabrication, metal size modulation, carbon shell tuning, and multimetal coupling. Subsequently, the recent advances in C@NPMs for ORR, OER, HER, and CO2RR catalysis are analyzed, covering the fundamentals (elemental steps, performance metrics, and catalytic mechanisms) of these reactions. This review not only analyzes the progress in the field but also conveys methods and provides insights, which can guide the future development and practical applications of C@NPMs.									44	2	0	0	2	0	45			2366-9608			WOS:000564841600001

Such a feat is achieved by exsolution of the B-site cations to bimetallic nanoparticles (NPs) decorated on the perovskite surface. Sr0.95Nb0.1Co0.9-xNixO3-delta (0.1 <= x <= 0.4) was prepared by calcination at 1000 degrees C and treated under 10% H-2/N-2 to create <30 nm Co-Ni exsolved NPs. Oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activities are facilitated with x = 0.1 composition whereas hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) activity is boosted when x = 0.2. NP exsolution at 400 degrees C results in remarkable improvement in the activities such that the overpotentials drop by 58, 48 and 91 mV from their preceding parent compositions to 380, 347 and 208 mV at 10 mA cm(-2), -3 mA cm(-2) and -10 mA cm(-2) for the OER, ORR and HER, respectively at pH 14. In terms of pH universality, HER overpotential is redressed to 183 mV at pH 0. The improved catalytic activity as compared to several reported perovskite oxide and non-perovskite based systems could be attributed to the simultaneous regulation of an optimal e(g) orbital filling, cation vacancies at catalytically active B-sites, lower metal-oxygen bond hybridization, oxygen non-stoichiometry, surface oxygen vacancies, and ionic and charge-transfer abilities.									46	1	0	0	1	0	45			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000482139000023

The nanochains, which consist of uniform nanospheres connecting each other, can range up to several micrometers. The thickness of Co9S8 shell can be changed by regulating the sulfurization time. In this heterostructure of Co@Co9S8, Co nanochains function as a conductive network and can inject electrons into Co9S8, which manipulates the work function of Co9S8 and makes it more apposite for catalysis. The density functional theory calculation also reveals that coupling with Co can significantly reduce the overpotential needed to drive the oxygen evolution process. On the basis of the exclusive structure, Co@Co9S8 nanochains have shown high catalytic activity in the oxygen evolution reaction. Co@Co9S8 reaches an overpotential of 285 my at 10 mA cm(-2), which is much lower than that of Co nanochains (408 mV) and Co9S8 (418 mV). Co@Co9S8 also shows higher catalytic activity and robustness compared to state-of-the-art noble-metal catalyst RuO2.									34	1	0	0	0	0	34			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000430156000020	29521497

The systematic trends in OER activity as a function of composition, defect-order, and electrical conductivity have been demonstrated, leading to a methodical increase in OER catalytic activity: Ca2Fe2O6-<CaSrFe2O6-<Sr2Fe2O6-. Sr2Fe2O6- also has the highest electrical conductivity and a unique type of defect-order. In conventional experiments using glassy carbon electrode, Sr2Fe2O6- shows better OER activity than the current state of the art catalysts, Ba0.5Sr0.5Co0.8Fe0.2O3- and RuO2. It also offers a high intrinsic electrical conductivity, which allows it to act as a catalyst without the need for glassy carbon electrode or carbon powder. Pure disks of this material exhibit an outstanding activity for OER, without any additives or need for electrode preparation.									38	0	0	0	0	0	36			1433-7851	1521-3773		WOS:000458828000031	30576041

The design and synthesis of materials with such features is highly desirable, but challenging. Here, we successfully synthesized PdPtIr porous nanotubes (PdPtIr PNTs-400, PdPtIr PNTs annealed at 400 degrees C) combining the advantages of abundant twin defects, HIF5, and an ultrahigh surface/volume ratio. The mass activity of PdPtIr PNTs-400 is 1.26 A mg(pd+pt+lr)(-1) and the specific activity is 1.3 A cm(-2) in acidic media. PdPtIr PNTs-400 are also stable in acidic electrolyte, and show little change after 30 000 cycles. Specifically, the overpotential gap between the ORR overpotential at -3 mA cm(-2) and OER overpotential at 10 mA cm(-2) (ORR-OER) is 642 mV, which is the lowest when compared with catalysts reported in the literature. Such an ultra-low overpotential gap reveals their superior oxygen reduction and evolution reaction activity. The DFT calculation results show that the adsorption energy E-0 of oxygen upon introducing Ir atoms into a Pt and Pd composite is optimal on the (211) facet. This study provides a new strategy for the effective design of multiple "active sites" in 1D nanomaterials, which is helpful when preparing oxygen electrocatalysts with superior performance.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000790481500001

A synergistic doping and architecture engineering strategy by nanosecond laser ablation is used to generate a unique kind of highly disordered Ni-doped Fe3O4 nanoparticle clusters. Ni dopant and increased oxygen vacancies are simultaneously incorporated into Fe3O4 frameworks and thereby modulate the electronic configuration for an optimal binding affinity towards OER intermediates. Nanoparticles with average size of around 5 nm assemble randomly during laser ablation and construct a fluffy and porous architecture, which not only optimizes the number of exposed active sites but also accelerates mass transfer. Consequently, Ni-doped Fe3O4 clusters are revealed as a superior OER catalyst with a small overpotential of 272 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) and a small Tafel slope of 39.4 mV dec(-1), surpassing almost all spinel Fe-based OER catalysts. This work provides a new strategy to fabricate advanced cation-doped metal oxide nanostructures for related energy applications.									20	5	0	0	1	0	21			1864-5631	1864-564X		WOS:000473944000001	31190424

Herein, a facile ultrafast (5 s) synthetic approach is reported that produces a novel, efficient, non-noble metal oxygen-evolution nano-electrocatalyst that is composed of amorphous Ni-Fe bimetallic hydroxide film-coated, nickel foam (NF)-supported, Ni3S2 nanosheet arrays. The composite nanomaterial (denoted as Ni-Fe-OH@Ni3S2/NF) shows highly efficient electrocatalytic activity toward oxygen evolution reaction (OER) at large current densities, even in the order of 1000 mA cm(-2). Ni-Fe-OH@Ni3S2/NF also gives an excellent catalytic stability toward OER both in 1 m KOH solution and in 30 wt% KOH solution. Further experimental results indicate that the effective integration of high catalytic reactivity, high structural stability, and high electronic conductivity into a single material system makes Ni-Fe-OH@Ni3S2/NF a remarkable catalytic ability for OER at large current densities.									362	23	0	0	6	0	370			0935-9648	1521-4095		WOS:000402963400026	28370573

In this study, based on first principles calculations, the oxygen evolution (OER) and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) catalytic performance of different transition-metal (TM) atoms embedded into the surface of the self-intercalation structure Ta9Se12 (TM-Ta9Se12) were evaluated. The results demonstrate that the self-intercalated Ta-layer obviously improves the stability and catalytic activity of the system. Remarkably, Pd-Ta9Se12 under a tensile strain of 3 % was identified as an efficient bifunctional catalyst for OER and ORR with overpotentials of 0.65 and 0.42 V, respectively. Mechanistically, the intercalation structure of Ta9Se12 leads to a charge accumulation in the inner layer. But divertingly, under an external force, the charge in the inner layer will diffuse to the surface. This curious phenomenon can provide the possibility for directional and continuous regulation of the catalytic performance of the catalysts. This work elucidates a new approach for designing high-efficient and stable bifunctional SACs for OER and ORR.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000861070000003

Herein, we fabricate ultrathin nickel-incorporated cobalt phosphide porous nano-sheets (Ni-CoP) featuring an atomic heterometallic site (NiCo16-xP6) via a boron-assisted method. The presence of boron induces a release-and-oxidation mechanism, resulting in the gradual exfoliation of hydroxide nanosheets. After a subsequent phosphorization process, the resultant Ni-CoP nanosheets are implanted with unsaturated atomic heterometallic NiCo16-xP6 sites (with Co vacancies) for alkaline hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The optimized Ni-CoP exhibits a low overpotential of 88 and 290 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) for alkaline HER and OER, respectively. This can be attributed to reduced free energy barriers, owing to the direct influence of center Ni atoms to the adjacent Co/P atoms in NiCo16-xP6 sites. These provide fundamental insights on the correlation between atomic structures and catalytic activity.									50	1	0	0	3	0	50			1530-6984	1530-6992		WOS:000611082000111	33398997

Here, a sequential self-templating method to synthesize CoNiFe trimetallic carbonate hydroxide hierarchical hollow microflowers (CN-xFe HMs) with oxygen vacancies (V-O) is reported. The synergistic merits of hollow structure, Fe substitution, and V-O endow the CN-xFe HMs with high active-site exposure density and increased electrical conductivity. Specially, the optimized CN-xFe HMs validate the excellent OER performance with an overpotential of 258 mV to drive 10 mA cm(-2) and a Tafel slope of 48.7 mV dec(-1). Theoretical calculations reveal that Fe substitution and V-O can synergistically regulate the electronic states to achieve near-ideal adsorption/desorption capacity for oxygenated intermediates. Moreover, the successful synthesis of other six metals substituted CoNiM (M = Cu, Zn, Cr, Mo, Er and La) carbonate hydroxides provides a universal protocol to construct transition multimetallic electrocatalysts with hollow structures for gaining highly efficient energy conversion reactions.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			1616-301X	1616-3028		WOS:000804088700001

Although water splitting and fuel cells are commercially mature technologies, they are still limited on large scale primarily due to the abundancy of the currently utilized expensive materials as well as the sluggish kinetics of the underlaying reactions, oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), and thus the required large observed overpotentials. Therefore, an efficient inexpensive catalyst is necessary. In the last decade, metal chalcogenides have been attractive materials in electrocatalysis of OER and ORR. Herein, we provide an overview on the recent advances on particularly metal-rich chalcogenides such as heazlewoodite- and pentlandite-types including their electrochemical activities and OER mechanisms. Likewise, examples of state-of-the-art metal chalcogenides revealing bifunctional activity for both OER and ORR are also presented. Diverse strategies to improve the catalytic performance are discussed and current challenges and future perspectives towards further development in this field are addressed.									12	0	0	0	0	0	12			1434-1948	1099-0682		WOS:000539016800001

The development of suitable oxygen evolution materials driven by sunlight is hence the most challenging research topic in the field of photocatalysis. Herein, photocatalytic O-2 production from water at a rate of 22.6 mu mol h(-1) was performed by using a pyrene-based organic molecule constructed through the Ullmann coupling reaction. Its significantly improved light-harvesting ability and notably accelerated separation and transfer of photogenerated charges enhanced the O-2 evolution efficiency.

Here, we report a partially oxidized Co in situ anchored in a porous nitrogen-doped nano carbon dodecahedron and its application in electrocatalytic overall water splitting. The Co3O4 shell worked as an efficient charge separation layer while the metallic Co inner core transported the separated charges immediately to the N-carbon framework. By constructing a Schottky barrier between the Co3O4 shell and metallic Co core, the charge separation and transport processes were speeded up and thus the electrocatalytic activities were dramatically enhanced.									60	1	0	0	1	0	60			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000401930100007

These metal di-selenides are actively being used as target material for increasing the number of electrocatalytic active sites and in turn to improve the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activities by increasing the ratio of edges to the basal plane. In present work, we have studied the activity of pristine and alkali atoms (Na, K and Ca) doped-SnSe2 for HER and OER catalyst. The state-of-art density functional theory (DFT) based computations are performed for estimating the catalytic activity of the pristine and doped SnSe2 by means of evaluating the adsorption and Gibbs free energies subjected to hydrogen and oxygen adsorption. Further, to get better prediction of adsorption energy on the individual catalytic surface, we have included the dispersion correction term to exchange-correlation functional. Results show that the pristine SnSe2 is not a good HER catalyst when hydrogen is adsorbed on its basal plane. However, edge-sites show the good hydrogen adsorption and indicates that the edges of SnSe2 are the most preferential site for hydrogen adsorption. As far as the catalytic activity of SnSe2 with dopants is concerned, the Na-doped SnSe2 among all shows the best catalytic activity over its edge-site; whereas K and Ca doped SnSe2 show basal plane as preferred catalytic site. It is interesting to note that the disadvantage of low catalytic activity on basal plane of SnSe2 can be improved by selective doping of alkali metals. (C) 2019 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC.

In this work, we report a novel nanocoral-like NiSe2/g-C3N4 composite as highly efficient catalyst for water oxidation in 1.0 M KOH solution. Based on the support of multi-layered g-C3N4, NiSe2/g-C3N4 composite exhibits favorable electrocatalytic performances with low overpotential of 290 mV at current density of 40 mA cm(-2) and low onset potential of 1.38 V (vs. RHE). In addition, NiSe2/g-C3N4 composite delivers higher current density (199 mA cm(-2)) than those of pure NiSe2 (142 mA cm(-2)) and multi-layered g-C3N4 (112 mA cm(-2)) at potential of 2.0 V (vs. RHE). Furthermore, NiSe2/g-C3N4 composite exhibits an excellent long-term electrochemical stability for 10 h.

The produced NiO@RuO2@mC nanoparticles (NPs) display a loose porous structure, which can remarkably facilitate mass transfer and bubble diffusion during electrocatalysis. RuO2 NPs can tune the electronic structure of Ni and decrease charge-transfer resistance, further leading to fast electron transport and enhancing the intrinsic electrocatalytic activities. The developed NiO@RuO2@mC catalyst demonstrates good stability, long-term durability, and excellent electrocatalytic oxygen evolution reaction and promising hydrogen evolution reaction in alkaline medium. For oxygen evolution reaction, the catalyst shows a low overpotential of 170 mV for obtaining a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) and a small Tafel slope of 57 mV dec(-1); for hydrogen evolution reaction, it shows an overpotential of -129 mV for delivering a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) and a Tafel slope of 120 mV dec(-1). Consequently, when NiO@RuO2@mC catalyst is used as a two-electrode alkaline electrolyzer for water splitting, a current density of 30 mA cm(-2) is achieved at a low cell voltage of 1.52 V.

However, their application is greatly hampered by the slow kinetics of oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) of air electrode. It is of great importance to develop good oxygen electrocatalysts with long durability as well as low cost. Here, A-site deficient (SmSr)(0.95)Co0.9Pt0.1O3 perovskites have been studied as potential OER electrocatalysts prepared by EDTA-citrate acid complexing method. OER electrocatalytic performance of (SmSr)(0.95)Co0.9Pt0.1O3 was also evaluated. (SmSr)(0.95)Co0.9Pt0.1O3 electrocatalysts exhibited good OER activities in 0.1 M KOH with onset potential and Tafel slope of 1.50 V and 87 mV dec(-1), similar to that of Ba0.5Sr0.5Co0.8Fe0.2O3 (BSCF-5582). Assembled rechargeable Zn-air batteries exhibited good discharge potential and charge potential with high stability, respectively. Overall, all results illustrated that (SmSr)(0.95)Co0.9Pt0.1O3 is an excellent OER electrocatalyst for zinc-air batteries. Additionally, this work opens a good way to synthesize highly efficient electrocatalysts from A-site deficient perovskites.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0				2073-4344		WOS:000832176000001

In the mathematical model, a two-dimensional steady-state was used to predict the crevice pH profile by taking into account dissolved oxygen and hydrogen ions within the crevice. It consists of six parallel electrochemical reactions: multi anodic reactions(Fe, Cr, Ni dissolution reactions) and three cathodic reactions(the oxygen reduction, the hydrogen reaction and water dissociation). Current density distribution and oxygen concentration distribution were determined to be corresponding to the evolution of potential distribution within the crevice. The contribution of each metal reaction to the overall corrosion process was in proportion to the mole fraction, and the simulation provided a good agreement with published experimental results for the crevice corrosion of stainless steel in sodium chloride solution.									9	2	0	0	0	0	10			1005-9040	2210-3171		WOS:000283618500029

This system shows highperformance for both phenol degradation and hydrogen evolution.We demonstrate that the degradation rate of phenol on the activeanode is governed by the mass transfer rate at a low phenolconcentration (0.5-2 mM) and by the electro-oxidation rate at ahigh phenol concentration (5 mM). The anodic oxygen evolutionreaction (OER) can promote the phenol degradation throughenhanced mass transfer efficiency. More importantly, the commondeactivation issue of phenol electro-oxidation on the inert anodecan be eliminated by the high OER activity of the active anode. Theconstructed full electrolytic cell only needs a low potential of 1.498V to achieve 10 mA/cm2for water electrolysis. The reported promotion effect of phenol degradation by OER as well as theimproved anode resistance to deactivation offer new insights into efficient and robust waste-to-resource electrolysis system for water treatment.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			0013-936X	1520-5851		WOS:000798709200045	35420409

The factors affecting the growth and electrocatalytic properties of the latter are described. In particular, steady-state Tafel plot analysis and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy have been used to elucidate the kinetics and mechanism of oxygen evolution. Tafel slopes of ca. 60 mV dec(-1) and 40 mV dec(-1) are found at low overpotentials depending on the oxide growth conditions, with an apparent Tafel slope of ca. 120 mV dec(-1) at high overpotentials. Reaction orders of ca. 0.5, 1.0 and 1.5 are observed at low and high overpotentials, again depending on the oxide growth conditions. A mechanistic scheme involving the active participation of octahedrally coordinated anionic iron oxyhydroxide surfaquo complexes, which form the porous hydrous layer, is proposed. The latter structure contains considerable quantities of water molecules which facilitate hydroxide ion discharge at the metal site during active oxygen evolution. This work brings together current research in both heterogeneous electrocatalysis and homogeneous molecular catalysis for water oxidation. (C) 2013 The Electrochemical Society.

However, its development is seriously hampered by the sluggish kinetics of oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER), resulting in notorious overpotential and mediocre cycle stability. Here, we elaborately design the free-standing NiSe2 @ NiO heterostructure on conductive carbon cloth as oxygen electrode for Li-O-2 batteries. The electronic redistribution at the interface between NiSe2 and NiO caused by the strong electronic interaction can strengthen electron transfer and optimize the adsorption energy of reaction intermediates, thereby immensely boosting the ORR/OER kinetics. Therefore, Li-O-2 batteries with NiSe2 @NiO oxygen electrodes show the highly discharge capacity of 11512 mAh g(-1) at 500 mA g(-1) and outstanding stability of over 360 h. This work enriches the understanding on the influence of electronic structure modulation of heterostructural transition metal dichalcogenides on their catalytic activity towards oxygen electrode reactions in Li-O-2 batteries.

Identifying the intrinsic composition/structure-property relationship of the oxide layer on the cobalt pnictides is critical to design better and cheaper electrocatalysts for the commercial viability of OER technologies. In this work, the restructured oxide layer on the cobalt pnictides and its effect on the activity and mechanism for OER is systematically analyzed. In-situ electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and near edge x-ray absorption fine structure (NEXAFS) spectra indicate that a higher OER performance of cobalt pnictides than Co3O4 is attributed to the more structural disorder and oxygen defect sites in the cobalt oxide layer evolved from cobalt pnictides. Using angle resolved x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (AR-XPS) further demonstrates that the oxygen defect sites mainly concentrate on the subsurface of cobalt oxide layer. The current study demonstrated promising opportunities for further enhancing the OER performance of cobalt-based electrocatalysts by controlling the subsurface defects of the restructured active layer.									39	1	0	0	6	0	39			1613-6810	1613-6829		WOS:000538008500006	32162756

In this work, to investigate the bifunctionality of the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), Ni-substituted LaMnO3 perovskite oxides (LaNixMn1-xO3, x = 0.1, 0.3, 0.5, 0.7, and 0.9) and pristine LaNiO3 and LaMnO3 were synthesized using a sol-gel process. After the compositional optimization and electrochemical characterizations, we identified that LaNi0.3Mn0.7O3 (SG LNM-3) within the compositions exhibited balanced intrinsic activity for bifunctional ORR and OER. To further improve the apparent activity of the optimized SG LNM-3, electrospinning was used to prepare one-dimensional nanostructured LaNi0.3Mn0.7O3 (ES LNM-3). ES LNM-3 had a higher specific surface area and continuous electron-transfer pathways, resulting in much improved bifunctional activity in comparison to SG LNM-3. In addition to the morphological effect, we ascribed the high electrochemical performance of ES LNM-3 to the high-spin Mn3+ and low-spin Ni3+ with electron configurations of t(2g)(3)e(g)(1) and t(2g)(6)e(g)(1) (a well-recognized design descriptor), as well as the high degree of Jahn-Teller distortion. After assembling ES LNM-3 within Zn-air batteries, promising electrochemical performances such as high power density and rate capability were obtained. Our findings will advance the development of high-performance and inexpensive oxygen electrocatalysts and associated ECS devices.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2574-0962			WOS:000820421200001

Unfortunately, photoelectron based spectroscopies are not directly compatible with the liquids required to investigate electrochemical processes, especially in the soft X-ray regime. To overcome this issue, different approaches based on photoelectron spectroscopy have been developed in our group over the last few years. The performance and the degree of information provided by these approaches are compared with those of the well established bulk sensitive spectroscopic approach of total fluorescence yield detection, where the surface information gained from this approach is enhanced using samples with large surface to bulk ratios. The operation of these approaches is exemplified and compared using the oxygen evolution reaction on IrOx catalysts. We found that all the approaches, if properly applied, provide similar information about surface oxygen speciation. However, using resonant photoemission spectroscopy, we were able to prove that speciation is more involved and complex than previously thought during the oxygen evolution reaction on IrOx based electrocatalysts. We found that the electrified solid-liquid interface is composed of different oxygen species, where the terminal oxygen atoms on iridium are the active species, yielding the formation of peroxo species and, finally, dioxygen as the reaction product. Thus, the oxygen-oxygen bond formation is dominated by peroxo species formation along the reaction pathway. Furthermore, the methodologies discussed here open up opportunities to investigate electrified solid-liquid interfaces in a multitude of electrochemical processes with unprecedented speciation capabilities, which are not accessible by one-dimensional X-ray spectroscopies.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1359-6640	1364-5498		WOS:000789340800001	35485389

Here a simple yet cost-effective strategy is developed to fabricate nitrogen and phosphorus dual-doped graphene/carbon nanosheets (N,P-GCNS) with N,P-doped carbon sandwiching few-layers-thick graphene. The as-prepared N,P-GCNS shows outstanding catalytic activity toward both ORR and OER with a potential gap of 0.71 V between the OER potential at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) and the ORR potential at a current density of -3 mA cm(-2), illustrating that it is the best metal-free bifunctional electrocatalysts reported to date. The superb bifunctional catalytic performance is attributed to the synergistic effects between the doped N and P atoms, the full exposure of the active sites on the surface of the N,P-GCNS nanosheets, the high conductivity of the incorporated graphene, and the large surface area and hierarchical pores for sufficient contact and rapid transportation of the reactants.									550	39	0	0	20	0	561			2155-5435			WOS:000357626800029

The high concentration of surface active sites afforded by their high surface area, intrinsically variable oxidation state and good electron transport lead to promising electrocatalytic properties for oxygen evolution in Li-O2 cells, yielding rechargeable discharge capacities over 10 000 mAh g-1 and lowering anodic overpotentials significantly. The discharge capacity of the Li-O2 cell is increased further when a small amount of gold is deposited on the pyrochlore oxide, which serves as a more efficient oxygen reduction catalyst. The amount of catalyst necessary for oxygen evolution performance is reduced to as little as 5 wt% by supporting the highly-divided pyrochlore oxide crystallites on carbon using in-situ deposition methods.									152	15	0	0	10	0	160			1614-6832			WOS:000306311100017

Doping selenium atoms into cobalt sulfide not only is favourable for accelerating the transition from *OH to *O via increasing the electron density around cobalt centers, but also induces the formation of effective metal-oxygen and selenite/selenate species, resulting in significantly increasing the oxygen evolution reaction activity without the obvious deterioration of the oxygen reduction reaction activity. Moreover, graphene nanofoam supports with hierarchical porosity and high crystallinity provide large ion-accessible surface area for sufficiently exposing active sites to the electrolyte and prevents the deactivation of active sites via the formation of a 3-e5 layered graphene at the surface as a protective layer. Hence, a superior catalytic performance is achieved with a comparable mass activity to Pt/C catalyst and an overpotential of 347 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) for the oxygen evolution reaction. This work gives an insight into the design of efficient and robust first-row transition-metal electrocatalysts via structural engineering and anionic doping. (C) 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

However, such undertaking has been a huge challenge due to the high cost of noble metals (e.g. Pt, Ir) and their stability when used as catalysts. Herein, we report CoMn2O4 embedded on three-dimensional (3D) hierarchical porous carbon (HPC) derived from waste corn cobs as a possible noble metal-free bifunctional electrocatalyst. The hybrid catalyst is fabricated by solvothermal reaction of as-prepared N-doped 3DHPC and CoMn2O4. The template-free approach in preparing N-3DHPC ensures ample nitrogen doping using melamine to improve electronic conductivity of carbon and formation of threedimensional, interconnected pore network, which is favorable for CoMn2O4 crystal dispersion. The same hybrid material also presents good OER activity, rendering an active and inexpensive dual-function electrocatalyst.

Pt-Ir-based bimetallic compounds along with carbon-supported titanium oxides (C-TiO2) have been synthesized for the application as electrocatalysts in lithium oxygen batteries. Transition metal oxide-based bimetallic nanocomposites (Pt-Ir/C-TiO2) were prepared by an incipient wetness impregnation technique. The as-prepared electrocatalysts were composed of a well-dispersed homogenous alloy of nanoparticles as confirmed by X-ray diffraction patterns and Fourier transform scanning electron microscopy analyses. The electrochemical characterizations reveal that the Pt-Ir/C-TiO2 electrocatalysts were bifunctional with high activity for both ORR and OER. When applied as an air cathode catalyst in lithium-air batteries, the electrocatalyst improved the battery performance in terms of capacity, reversibility, and cycle life compared to that of cathodes without any catalysts.									7	2	0	0	0	0	7			1432-8488	1433-0768		WOS:000374840400020

Herein, the NaCl template synthesis of individual nickel (Ni) SACs is reported, bonded to oxygen sites on graphene-like carbon (denoted as Ni-O-G SACs) with superior activity and stability for OER. A variety of characterizations unveil that the Ni-O-G SACs present 3D porous framework constructed by ultrathin graphene sheets, single Ni atoms, coordinating nickel atoms to oxygen. Consequently, the catalysts are active and robust for OER with extremely low overpotential of 224 mV at current density of 10 mA cm(-2), 42 mV dec(-1) Tafel slope, oxygen production turn over frequency of 1.44 S-1 at 300 mV, and long-term durability without significant degradation for 50 h at exceptionally high current of 115 mA cm(-1), outperforming the state-of-the-art OER SACs. A theoretical simulation further reveals that the bonding between single nickel and oxygen sites results in the extraordinary boosting of OER performance of Ni-O-G SACs. Therefore, this work opens numerous opportunities for creating unconventional SACs via metal-oxygen bonding.									126	7	0	0	9	0	125				2198-3844		WOS:000507977100001	32154084

Herein, a hybrid electrocatalyst of FeCo alloy nanoparticles embedded in a porous N-doped carbon was prepared via a pyrolysis process of low-cost melamine sponge and mass-produced metal-polyphenol network. Benefting from the metal coordination of metal-polyphenol network and abundant N source of melamine sponge, the metal-N moiety and FeCo alloy nanoparticles (wtih a diameter around 50 nm) encapsulated in a N-doped graphene-like carbon layer were formed in-situ. Such intimate integration of graphene-like carbon-encapsulated FeCo alloys, metal-N active species, and porous structure is conducive to improve the catalytic activity and increase the catalytic durability in alkaline media. As a consequence, the as-prepared electrocatalyst exhibits the pronounced activity toward ORR, OER, and HER simultaneously under alkaline condition, particularly on the performances of potential, stability, and methanol tolerance.

Transition metal-based electrocatalysts have demonstrated a highly promising catalytic performance in electrochemical HER or OER. Moreover, their electrocatalytic performance can be further improved using a self-supported structure of the electrocatalyst, owing to strong physicochemical contact between the catalyst and current collector. In this context, we propose vanadium-incorporated cobalt phosphide (CoVP) self-supported catalysts on carbon cloth (CoVP@CC) as highly efficient bifunctional electrocatalysts for alkaline HER and OER. In CoVP@CC, V plays a crucial role in modulating the surface electronic structure of the self-supported CoP nanosheets, leading to excellent catalytic activity in both HER and OER. The self-supported CoVP@CC demonstrates a promising overall water-splitting performance, requiring only 1.61 V to afford a current density of 10 mA cm(-2). (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

Whilst there is a plethora of multi-elemental 2D materials, the number mono-elemental 2D materials is rather limited. Herein, we demonstrate that aqueous shear exfoliation can be used to obtain As, Sb, and Bi exfoliated nanosheets. Morphological and chemical characterization of the exfoliated materials shows a decrease in thickness, sheet-to-nanosheet scale, and partial oxidation owing to a higher surface area. The electrochemical performance is tested in terms of inherent electrochemistry, electron transfer, and sensing applications as demonstrated with ascorbic acid. Potential energy-related applications are evaluated in the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), oxygen evolution reaction (OER), and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), with shear-exfoliated Sb having the best electrochemical performance overall. These findings will have a profound impact on the preparation and application of 2D mono-elemental materials.									191	8	0	0	9	0	193			1433-7851	1521-3773		WOS:000414764600010	28755460

Here, we develop a type of electrocatalyst with core@shell structure in the form of binary FeNi alloy nanoparticles coated by highly defective nitrogen-doped carbon shell with mesoporous architecture. The composite annealed at 800 degrees C with Fe/Ni ratio of 1:2 presents extremely high catalytic activity and durability for oxygen evolution in 1.0 M KOH electrolyte, which delivers a low overpotential of 273 mV to achieve a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) and a small Tafel slope of 37.82 mV dec(-1). We find that appropriate Fe-doping to regulate the surface electronic structure around the active sites is responsible for boosting the electrocatalytic performance. Remarkably, hydroxyl groups introduced along with the Fe doping, acting as an active 0 radical to facilitate the adsorption of intermediates, are identified as another decisive factor to promote the intrinsic activity for the oxygen evolution reaction. Moreover, such an N-doped carbon shell endows the composite with enriched defects, high conductivity and satisfactory stability, favoring fast electron transfer kinetics. The substantially high catalytic performance of the fabricated binary metallic electrocatalyst makes it potential application in energy storage and conversion devices.									27	3	0	0	1	0	28			0378-7753	1873-2755		WOS:000490030800043

Manganese oxide is an interesting candidate as an oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalyst, but the minimum thickness above which MnOx thin films become OER-active has not yet been established. In this work, ultrathin (<10 nm) manganese oxide films are grown on silicon by atomic layer deposition to study the origin of OER activity under alkaline conditions. We found that MnOx films thinner than 1.5 nm are not OER-active. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy shows that this is due to electrostatic catalyst-support interactions that prevent the electrochemical oxidation of the manganese ions close to the interface with the support, while in thicker films, Mn-III and Me oxide layers appear as OER-active catalysts after oxidation and electrochemical treatment. From our investigations, it can be concluded that one Mn-III,Mn-IV-O monolayer is sufficient to establish oxygen evolution under alkaline conditions. The results of this study provide important new design criteria for ultrathin manganese oxide oxygen evolution catalysts.									8	1	0	0	1	0	8			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000612551400025	33426879

Herein, a durable metal-organic framework (MOF) with minor atomically dispersed ruthenium and an optimized electronic structure is constructed as an efficient electrocatalyst. Significantly, the obtained NiRu0.08-MOF with doping Ru only needs an overpotential of 187 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) with a Tafel slop of 40 mV dec(-1) in 0.1 M KOH for the oxygen evolution reaction, and can work continuously for more than 300 h. Ultrahigh Ru mass activity is achieved, reaching 56.7 A g(Ru)(-1) at an overpotential of 200 mV, which is 36 times higher than that of commercial RuO2. X-ray adsorption spectroscopy and density function theory calculations reveal that atomically dispersed ruthenium on metal sites in MOFs is expected to optimize the electronic structure of nickel sites, thus improving the conductivity of the catalyst and optimizing the adsorption energy of intermediates, resulting in significant optimization of electrocatalytic performance. This study could provide a new avenue for the design of efficient and stable MOF electrocatalysts.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0				2637-9368		WOS:000860249900001

Hyperbranched NiCoP architecture organized by hierarchical nanorod-on-nanosheet arrays is rationally prepared as a demonstration via a facile solvothermal and phosphorization approach. A strong synergistic benefit from the multiscale building blocks is achieved to enable outstanding electrocatalytic properties in an alkaline electrolyzer, including low HER and OER overpotentials of 71 and 268 mV at 10 mA cm(-2), respectively, which significantly outperforms the counterparts of individual nanorods and nanosheets. The bifunctional catalysts also show highly efficient and durable overall water electrocatalysis with a small voltage of 1.57 V to drive a current density of 10 mA cm(-1). The present study will open a new window to engineering hyperbranched architectures with exceptional electrocatalytic activities toward overall water splitting.									76	2	0	0	4	0	77			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000452694100031	30398830

Herein, a novel PdNi carbon nanofiber (PdNi/CNF) catalyst was synthesized by facile electrospinning and carbonization processes. The size and homogeneity of the Pd-Ni alloy nanoparticles (NPs) could be effectively tuned by controlling the molar feed ratio of metal precursors. The morphology and structure of the PdNi/CNFs were characterized, and the working electrodes fabricated from the prepared catalyst mats were directly employed in the HER and OER. The PdNi/CNFs-1:2 catalyst exhibits high catalytic activity in the HER with a low overpotential of 55 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) in an acidic solution. Moreover, under 1 M KOH electrolyte, an overpotential of 187 mV is required in the HER over the catalyst to arrive 10 mA cm(-2) and an overpotential of 289 mV is achieved in the OER at the same current density. The superior HER and OER activities of the PdNi/CNFs are attributed to the synergistic effects of the PdNi alloy nanoparticles (NPs) assembled on the CNFs.

Herein, an ultrathin Co3O4 nanosheet is uniformly deposited on the chemical exfoliated MoS2 nanosheet (ex-MoS2) via an in-situ hydrolysis and epitaxial growth. These novel noble-metal-free OER catalysts were proposed as an excellent platform for water splitting to promote the oxygen evolution activity and stability. MoS2 introduction can improve the conductivity of Co3O4 nanosheets, generate more Co3+ species in Co3O4 nanosheets during electrochemical activation and render high durability against dissolution of Co3O4 nanosheets in high potential polarization. As a result, these novel Co3O4/ex-MoS2 hybrids exhibit an excellent OER activity with a remarkable low Tafel slope (ca. 36 mV dec(-1)), and a substantially small overpotential (ca. 290 mV required for 10 mA cm(-2)). Their OER stability is also outstanding, with 95.2% OER activity retention for 10000 potential cyclings. The superior OER performance is compatible to, and even better than state of art OER catalysts reported recently. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

The experimental parameters suggest that the mechanism is presumably similar to that put forward earlier by Krishtalik [51] for RuO2 layers, but a step common to oxygen evolution, like the case of polycrystalline samples, is present only with the (230) face. Reasons for this difference and for the apparent lower activity of the (110) face with respect to the (230) are discussed. A detailed analysis of the surface behavior of the two faces in Cl- free acid and alkaline solutions has also been carried out by cyclic voltammetry.									37	2	0	0	3	0	38			1432-8488	1433-0768		WOS:000229504200012

However, artificially developed oxygen evolution catalysts (OECs) show much less activity, and the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is now becoming a bottleneck in many energy-related issues. Here, the PSII is mimicked to design an efficient OER system in neutral environments by introducing an oleylamine (OAm) organic layer to cap the Co3O4 OEC, and employing buffers as proton shuttles in the system. Consequently, the activity is largely enhanced. The current density can reach 10 mA cm(-2) at an overpotential (eta) of 390 mV in the best case in neutral environment. The turnover frequency is 0.0117 at eta of 400 mV, almost the same as that in 1 M KOH solutions. The surface chemistry of the Co3O4 OEC indicates that the OAm can promote the activity. The reason that buffers as proton shuttles can greatly facilitate the reaction is ascribed to the proton-coupled electron transfer process in the OER mechanism. These results may stimulate new perspectives on mimicking natural systems as well as new insights in electrocatalysis.									16	0	0	0	1	0	16			1614-6832	1614-6840		WOS:000430163100003

Among them, water splitting is very appealing, and is receiving more and more attention. The critical challenge of this renewable-energy technology is to expedite the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) because of its slow kinetics and large overpotential. Therefore, developing efficient electrocatalysts with high catalytic activities is of great importance for high-performance water splitting. In the past few years, much effort has been devoted to the development of alternative OER electrocatalysts based on transition-metal elements that are low-cost, highly efficient, and have excellent stability. Here, recent progress on the design, synthesis, and application of OER electrocatalysts based on transition-metal elements, including Co, Ni, and Fe, is summarized, and some invigorating perspectives on the future developments are provided.									1092	55	0	0	38	0	1103			0935-9648	1521-4095		WOS:000391174600002	27569575

The oxides were analyzed by TGA, XRD, BET, and SEM. The cations distribution of CuxCo3-xO4 was discussed according to the change of the copper content (x). As x value increases from 0.7 to 0.9, more Co3+ ions enter the tetrahedral sites of spinel structure. Electrochemical measurements show that the occupation of Co3+ ions in tetrahedral sites is helpful to increase the electrocatalytic activities of the spinel oxides for oxygen evolution reaction in alkaline water electrolysis.

Here, we report NiFe Prussian blue analogue (PBA) as a promising electrocatalyst for OER in alkaline conditions. This material has an impressively low overpotential of 258 mV that reaches a current density of 10 mA cm(-2). Post-mortem characterization showed that the as-prepared catalyst is entirely transformed into amorphous nickel hydroxide after the electrochemical treatment, and Ni(OH)(2) acts as the active species. Operando X-ray spectroscopic studies further found that this in situ generated Ni(OH)(2) displays an unique feature that allows deprotonation under applied potential creating NiOOH2-x that contains Ni4+ ions. The deprotonation reaction is reversible and potential-dependent, i.e., the amount of Ni4+ increases with increasing applied potential. Theoretical calculations were used to show that the role of Ni4+ is to trigger oxidized oxygen ions as electrophilic centers with the subsequent activation of anion redox reactions for OER.									233	14	0	0	18	0	235			0002-7863	1520-5126		WOS:000444793400026	30111100

Here, we theoretically predict that carbon-based support could achieve the phase engineering regulation of catalysts by suppressing specific phase transformation. Taken single-walled carbon nanotube (SWCNT) as typical support, combined with calculated E-pH (Pourbaix) diagram and advanced synchrotron-based characterizations technologies prove there are two different active phases source from cobalt selenide which demonstrate that the feasibility of using support effect regulating the potential advantageous catalysts. Moreover, it is worth noting that the phase engineering derived Co3O4-SWCNT exhibits a low overpotential of 201 mV for delivering the current density of 10 mA/cm(2) in electrocatalytic oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Also, it reaches a record current density of 529 mA/cm(2) at 1.63 V (vs. RHE) in the electrocatalytic urea oxidation reaction (UOR), overwhelming most previously reported catalysts.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			1998-0124	1998-0000		WOS:000682660400006

The influence of the doping agent (Sb, F, Cl) and doping level on the oxygen-evolution reaction was studied in terms of Tafel slope, oxygen-overpotential and exchange current densities for the Ce3+ --> Ce4+ reaction. Tafel slopes of about 300 mV decade-1 were found and the oxygen evolution overpotential was 600 mV higher than that of platinum. While the doping level had no significant influence of Tafel slopes and oxygen overpotentials the stability of the SnO2 electrode increased with charge carrier density. The oxidation of phenol was investigated as a test for the oxidizing power of the new anode material when compared to Pt or PbO2. The rate of phenol removal was much higher for SnO2 than for PbO2 or Pt.									353	30	0	0	85	4	368			0021-891X	1572-8838		WOS:A1991EP14600004

The synthesis of affordable electrocatalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) involved in electrochemical water splitting, the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) for fuel cells in energy research and the detection of glucose in the sensor field are of high importance. Herein, we demonstrate the single step electrochemical formation of a gold doped-Co(OH)(2) electrocatalyst on a carbon support which is highly active for the three aforementioned electrocatalytic reactions. The distribution of gold within the Co(OH)(2) film can be controlled by electrochemical potential cycling and was measured by depth-profiling X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. The optimised Au-Co(OH)(2) films showed enhanced OER/ORR activity in alkaline conditions due to synergy between the materials. This resulted in excellent bifunctional activity for oxygen electrochemistry where a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) for the OER was reached at a potential of 1.55 V and -3 mA cm(-2) was achieved for the ORR via a 4 electron pathway at 0.69 V giving a combined overpotential eta(total) = eta(OER) + eta(ORR) of only 0.86 V in 0.1 M NaOH. In addition, due to the distribution of gold active sites within a Co(OH)(2) framework, the material was also active for the hydrogen evolution reaction as well as being sensitive and selective to glucose detection in the presence of common interfering species.									46	1	0	0	2	0	46			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000415990800042

However, the rational design and synthesis of OER catalysts to further enhance the electrochemical activity and durability remain major challenges. Herein, novel Co9S8 hollow spheres were successfully obtained through a template-and surfactant-free method, and they exhibit impressive electrocatalytic properties for the OER. Notably, the as-prepared material has superior OER performance with a low overpotential of 285 mV reached at 10 mA cm(-2), a Tafel slope of 58 mV decade(-1), and improved stability in 1 M aqueous solution KOH. Impressively, the unique hollow structure of Co9S8 hollow spheres imparts large surface area and abundant active sites, resulting in the superior catalytic activity. Thus, this work provides promising alternative cobalt sulfide-based oxygen evolution electrocatalysts to substitute for precious metal-based electrocatalysts.									55	3	0	0	2	0	58			2168-0485			WOS:000424728300039

Here, we synthesized a series of LaFe1-xMnxO3(x= 0, 0.1, 0.3, 0.5, 0.7, 0.9 and 1) perovskite oxides by doping Mn into LaFeO3(LF). The results show that the doping amount of Mn has a significant effect on the catalytic performance. Whenx= 0.5, the catalyst LaFe0.5Mn0.5O3(LFM) exhibits the best performance. The limiting current density in 0.1 mol center dot L-1KOH solution is 7 mA center dot cm(-2), much larger than that of the commercial Pt/C catalyst (5.5 mA center dot cm(-2)). Meanwhile, the performance of the doped catalyst is also superior to that of commercial Pt/C in terms of the long-term durability. The excellent catalytic performance of LFM may be ascribed to its abundant O2-/O(-)species and low charge transfer resistance after doping the Mn element.									4	1	0	0	0	0	4			2095-025X	2095-0268		WOS:000574072400002

Experimental methods have been developed for determining both the current of the electrochemical reduction of oxygen and the current of the oxygen cycle. Through these methods it has been established experimentally that the reduction of oxygen that results in the formation of water proceeds through an electrochemical mechanism of oxygen reactions and a chemical mechanism of reactions between the intermediate products of the oxygen and hydrogen reactions at the negative plate. A general mechanism has been proposed which involves the elementary reactions of oxygen reduction and of hydrogen evolution. The first stage of the reduction of oxygen results in formation of hydrogen peroxide that reacts (through a chemical reaction) with the atomic hydrogen evolved by the decomposition of water (chemical mechanism of water formation). Hydrogen peroxide can be reduced to H2O by an electrochemical reaction as well (electrochemical mechanism of water formation). Both mechanisms of water formation (chemical and electrochemical) are in competition as they use the same intermediate product (H2O2) of the oxygen reaction. At low temperatures, the electrochemical mechanism is the dominating one and at high temperatures, it is the chemical mechanism. A modified version of the general mechanism of oxygen reduction is proposed in which OH radicals and oxygen atoms are formed as intermediate products. Which of the above mechanisms will be activated, depends on the potential of the negative plate, the temperature and the catalytic properties of the lead surface (and of the alloying additives used) as well as on the saturation of the negative plate with electrolyte. The proposed mechanism indicates that the hydrogen reaction plays an important role in determining the efficiency of the oxygen cycle. (c) 2004 Elsevier B.V.

In this work, alternatively stacked self-assembled CoAl LDH/MoS2 nanohybrid has been successfully synthesized by an exfoliation-flocculation method from positively charged CoAl LDH nanosheets (CoAl-NS) with negatively charged MoS2 nanosheets (MoS2-NS). The CoAl LDH/MoS2 hybrid material exhibits an enhanced catalytic performance for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) compared with original constituents of CoAl LDH nanosheets and MoS2 nanosheets. The enhanced OER catalytic performance of CoAl LDH/MoS2 is demonstrated to be due to the improved electron transfer, more exposed catalytic active sites, and accelerated oxygen evolution reaction kinetics.									1	1	0	0	0	0	1			0254-5861			WOS:000452480400010

The electrodeposition mechanism and the morphology changes of the S-LDHs on different conductive substrates are discussed.

In particular, Janus catalysts simultaneously facilitating the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) are desirable. Herein, we fabricated a unique hierarchical heterostructure via growing Ni4W6O21(OH)(2)center dot 4H(2)O (denoted as Ni-W-O) nanosheets on NiMoO4 rods, which was indispensable for regulating the morphology of the Ni-W-O structure.

Herein, a triphasic nanocomposite with the encapsulated Ag-CoFe heterointerface in the graphitic carbon shell is developed via an electronic modulation strategy. The combination of Ag, the CoFe alloy and the carbon layer not only improves charge transfer, but also generates a synergistic effect and more active sites at the interface, significantly boosting the electrocatalytic activity. The obtained catalyst Ag-CoFe@NC-700 exhibits superior trifunctional catalytic activity for oxygen reduction, oxygen evolution and hydrogen evolution reactions (ORR/OER/HER). Interestingly, it reveals remarkable catalytic activity for oxygen electrocatalysis with a low overpotential (0.72 V), and displays good catalytic performance for the HER under alkaline conditions.

Here, we report a unique method to create abundant oxygen vacancies in hierarchical Ag/TiO2 nanoflowers during photocatalytic reaction, which is accompanied by light absorption variation and surface plasmon resonance (SPR) enhancement. Its high efficiency of photocatalytic H-2 evolution (the highest apparent quantum yield reaches 3.2% at 365 nm) and rhodamine B degradation can be considered as benefits from the synergistic effects of the well-arranged hierarchical structure, the photogenerated oxygen vacancies, and the SPR of cocatalyst Ag. This work proposes an effective strategy to optimize the synthesis of regular hierarchical structures and enriches the research on the vital function of oxygen vacancies in photocatalytic reactions.									12	1	0	0	1	0	12			2470-1343			WOS:000542223300056	32566866

However, its potentials for important electrochemical applications such as hydrogen evolution and oxygen reduction reactions have not been systematically studied. Till date, such applications have mainly applied precious metal and oxides with perovskite- or spinel-based structures. In this work, we synthesized a misfit layered mixed oxide in the form of Ca3Co4O9 and investigated its structural, morphological, and electrochemical properties. The misfit layered Ca3Co4O9 has promising capabilities as electrocatalyst for hydrogen evolution and oxygen reduction processes. A Tafel slope of 87 mV/decade for hydrogen evolution reaction was achieved by Ca3Co4O9, while the overpotential for oxygen reduction reaction was lowered up to 38 mV in comparison to glassy carbon. Moreover, a comparably higher heterogeneous electron transfer rate of 3.76 x 10(-4) cm s(-1) was achieved for Ca3Co4O9 compared to 3.11 x 10(-4) cm s(-1) for glassy carbon. The affordability and electrocatalytic properties have endowed Ca3Co4O9 as a potential replacement for precious metal in electrocatalysis and electrochemical sensing applications.									62	2	0	0	0	0	61			0897-4756	1520-5002		WOS:000339471400014

Among all the transition-metal-based electrocatalysts, the C@NCF-900 exhibits the highest ORR performance in terms of half-wave potential (0.93 V) in 0.1 m KOH. Moreover, C@NCF-900 exhibits negligible activity decay after 10 000 voltage cycles with minor reduction (0.006 V). In ZABs, C@NCF-900 outperforms the mixture of Pt/C 20 wt% and IrO2, cycled over 100 h under 58% depth of discharge condition.

Here, using 3d-M hydr(oxy)oxides, with distinct stoichiometries and morphologies in the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) regions, we establish the overall catalytic activities for these reaction as a function of a more fundamental property, a descriptor, OH-M2+delta bond strength (0 <= delta <= 1.5). This relationship exhibits trends in reactivity (Mn < Fe < Co < Ni), which is governed by the strength of the OH-M2+delta energetic (Ni < Co < Fe < Mn). These trends are found to be independent of the source of the OH, either the supporting electrolyte (for the OER) or the water dissociation product (for the HER). The successful identification of these electrocatalytic trends provides the foundation for rational design of 'active sites' for practical alkaline HER and OER electrocatalysts.									1923	78	0	0	115	0	1942			1476-1122	1476-4660		WOS:000304320300023	22561903

Herein, a facile two-step rheological phase reaction strategy was proposed to synthesize metallic cobalt modified MnO-C nanocrystalline composites (Co/MnO-C) for efficiently catalyzing oxygen reduction reactions (ORR) and oxygen evolution reactions (OER).

Incorporating low coordination atoms (LCAs) on the catalyst surface has shown great potential in improving electrocatalytic performance. Herein, MoS2/NiS2 heterostructure with abundant LCAs is designed toward efficiently promote oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Adopting the MoS2/NiS2 heterostructure as the oxygen electrode, Li-O-2 batteries exhibit a high discharge capacity of 12377.4 mAh g(-1) at 200 mA g(-1) and long cycling life over 1101 h. Density functional theory calculations uncover that the modulated d-band center of interfacial MoS2 and NiS2 originated from the electron interaction between LCAs and adjacent atoms can result in the strong adsorption of oxygen intermediates on the catalyst surface, which contributes to the outstanding catalytic performance.

It plays a pivotal role in achieving high-efficiency clean-energy production and energy storage in these devices. Transition metal-based bimetallic MOFs (TMB MOFs) with two different metal ions possess specific synergistic effects, which could exhibit OER performance and stability superior to those of the corresponding monometallic MOFs for water oxidation.

Herein, a Chlorella-derived catalyst with a nestlike framework, composed of bamboolike nanotubes that encapsulate cobalt nanoparticles, has been prepared through a facile pyrolysis process. It achieves perfect bifunctional catalysis both in ORR and OER on a single catalyst. For our optimal catalyst Co/M-Chlorella-900, its ORR half-wave potential is positively shifted by 40 mV compared to that of a commercial Pt/C catalyst, and the overpotential at 10 mA cm(-2) for the OER is 23 mV lower than that of a commercial IrO2/C catalyst in an alkaline medium. This superior bifunctional catalytic performance is benefited from the simultaneous increase of pyridinic N sites for ORR and graphitic N sites for OER In addition, N-doped carbon-encapsulated Co nanoparticles improve both ORE. and OER performance by forming new active centers. The unique nestlike carbon nanotube framework not only afforded highly dense ORR and OER active sites but also promoted the electron and mass transfer. Our catalyst also displays notable durability during the ORR and OER, making it promising for use in ORR/OER-related energy conversion systems.									43	1	0	0	3	0	43			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000411771400102	28845976

They are prepared with the aid of pollen, using a two-step annealing method. The interaction between NiMnO3 and NiMn2O4 nanoparticles results in an enhanced charge transfer between nanoparticles and active species in electrolytes, which is favorable for their electrocatalytic activities. The surface oxidation states of Ni and Mn for the hybrid oxides can be tuned by pollen, which greatly influences the OER and ORR activities and the overall bifunctional activity. The surface Ni3+ facilitates OER activity, while the surface Mn3+ with a small amount of Mn4+ favors ORR processes. Through optimization, 0.61NiMnO(3)/NiMn2O4 shows the highest OER activity, while 1.57NiMnO(3)/NiMn2O4 can outperform the others in promoting ORR processes. Between them, 0.61NiMnO(3)/NiMn2O4 exhibits the higher overall bifunctional activity. Furthermore, both of the optimized hybrid oxides show excellent durability during both OER and ORR processes.

The electrode is a key component that controls the efficiency of water splitting. Although noble metals such as Pt, Ru and Ir can achieve high energy efficiencies, their application in water splitting is limited by their high cost. Thus, developing efficient noble-metal-free electrodes is necessary to achieve sustainable hydrogen societies. Here, we report a technique of graphene encapsulation of NiMo alloys for realizing both high catalytic activity and high chemical stability in non-noble metal anodes in transition metal impurities-free aqueous KOH electrolyte. Electrochemical analysis showed that graphene encapsulation significantly enhanced the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activities of the NiMo anodes and provided long electrode lifetimes and performances comparable to those of commercially available anodes. Density functional theory calculation revealed that graphene encapsulation significantly reduced the adsorption energy of intermediates onto the NiMo surface, thereby remarkably enhancing the OER activity. The graphene encapsulation method provides a promising electrode design to improve the performance in water splitting electrolyzers.									38	4	0	0	1	0	38			2155-5435			WOS:000506725100086

J	Li, Xia; Hou, Mengxia; Qu, Xinbo; Zhang, Yunqiang; Li, Mei								Electric-Field Assisted Hydrolysis-Oxidation of MOFs: Hierarchical Ternary (Oxy)hydroxide Micro-Flowers for Efficient Electrocatalytic Oxygen Evolution								SMALL				18	6					2104863	10.1002/smll.202104863		DEC 2021		FEB 2022	2022	Water oxidation is the key process of electrocatalytic water splitting owing to its inherently slow kinetics. The ingenious design of microstructures for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalysts is an important way to accelerate the kinetics of the water splitting reaction. In this work, a facile electric-field assisted alkaline hydrolysis-oxidation strategy is proposed to prepare 3D layered micro-flowers in situ constructed from ultra-thin CoNiFe (oxy)hydroxide (CoNiFe-OH) hexagonal plates by using Co/Ni/Fe metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) as sacrificial templates and metal sources. The growth of the ballflowers can be accurately controlled by matching the hydrolysis rate of MOFs templates and the coprecipitation rate of metal ions. More importantly, continuous oxidation voltage can drive transformation of some hydroxides into oxyhydroxide with abundant oxygen vacancies. Benefiting from the open structure with multiple electroactive sites and optimized chemical composition, the layered CoNiFe-OH micro-flowers show appealing OER electrocatalytic performance with a low overpotential of 207 mV@10 mA cm(-2) and robust durability over 60 h. This work provides a strategy to prepare non-noble hierarchical nanostructured electrocatalysts for electrochemical energy conversion.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			1613-6810	1613-6829		WOS:000727232300001	34873836	
J	Yamaki, Jun-ichi; Shinjo, Yohei; Doi, Tayuki; Okada, Shigeto								The Rate Equation for Oxygen Evolution by Decomposition of LixCoO2 at Elevated Temperatures								JOURNAL OF THE ELECTROCHEMICAL SOCIETY				161	10			A1648	A1654		10.1149/2.0621410jes				2014	2014	The oxygen evolution from Li0.5CoO2 cathodes at elevated temperatures was investigated by mass spectrometry coupled with thermogravimetry (TG-MS). The rate equation for the oxygen evolution from Li0.5CoO2 (particle diameters: 1-5 mu m) was found to be d alpha/dt = 1.88 x 10(8) (exp(-114 x 1000/RT))(1- alpha)(1.62), where a is the fractional degree of conversion of reactants; the values obtained using this equation showed a good agreement with the experimental ones for the dependency of the oxygen evolution speed on the temperature rising speed. With minor parameter changes of the rate equation, the equations could explain the dependence of the oxygen evolution speed on x in LixCoO2. Nano-sized Li0.5CoO2 (particle diameters: 200-400 nm) was prepared and the influence of the particle size on the oxygen evolution speed was investigated. The nano-sized Li0.5CoO2 Showed a shift of the onset temperatures of O-2 evolution from 240 degrees C to 210 degrees C. When the frequency factor is optimized, the values calculated using the modified equation were coincident with the experimental ones for the nano-sized Li0.5CoO2.

The purpose of the given work was to identify the relationship between the chemical and phase composition of materials based on lead dioxide, their physicochemical properties, and their electrocatalytic activity. The main research methods were quasi-stationary polarization and impedance spectroscopy, photocolorimetry, fluorescent and spectrophotometry in the UV and visible regions, atomic absorption spectroscopy, and high performance liquid chromatography (analysis of the solutions). It was shown that the modification of lead dioxide by ionic additives results in significant changes in the electrocatalytic activity of the system in respect to the oxygen evolution reaction and electrochemical oxidation reactions of organic compounds. It was found that, at low polarizations, the oxygen evolution reaction is limited by the electrochemical desorption step (the second electron transfer), and its overpotential at PbO2-modified electrodes increases in the order that coincides with the dependence in which the number of oxygen-containing particles strongly bound to the electrode surface increases. It was found that the rate of oxidation of organic substances on the anode materials involved is directly proportional to the amount of oxygen-containing radicals formed on the electrode during the water oxidation.									6	0	0	0	3	0	6			1068-3755	1934-8002		WOS:000431798300006

Hetero-structured transition metal sulfides are regarded as quite promising electrocatalytic materials, considering their intrinsic activity and prominent synergistic effect. However, the essential surface reconstruction process of transition metal sulfides renders a great challenge to reveal the real active sites and the relative electrocatalytic reaction mechanism. Herein, novel sea urchinlike NiCo bimetallic sulfide (denoted as NiS/Co3S4) catalysts with highly exposed heterogeneous interface is designed for efficient OER. The high electrochemical active surface as well as effectual charge-transfer effect ensures NiS/Co3S4 catalysts with superior activity and durability, such as a low overpotential of 285 mV at 100 mA/cm(2), a small Tafel slope of 66 mV/dec as well as the long-term stability for 60 h. The post OER characterizations confirm that high valence of Ni dominated metal sites expedite the surface reconstruction process and the formed Ni (oxy)hydroxides significantly accelerate the process of oxygen evolution reaction.

Herein, the NiFe Prussian blue analogue (NiFe-PBA)-F catalyst with a multilevel structure was obtained from NiFe-PBAs via a fluorination strategy, which presents an ultralow OER overpotential of 190 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) in alkaline solution, with a small Tafel slope of 57 mV dec(-1) and excellent stability. Interestingly, surface fluorination engineering could achieve a controllable removal of ligands of the cyan group, contributing to keep the framework structure of NiFe-PBAs. Particularly, NiFe-PBAs-F undergoes a dramatic reconstruction with the dynamic migration of F ions, which creates more active sites of F-doped NiFeOOH and affords more favorable adsorption of oxygen intermediates. Density functional theory calculations suggest that F doping increases the state density of Ni 3d orbital around the Fermi level, thus improving the conductivity of NiFeOOH. Furthermore, based on our experimental results, the lattice oxygen oxidation mechanism for NiFe-PBAs-F was proposed. Our work not only provides a new pathway to realize the controllable pyrolysis of NiFe-PBAs but also gives more insights into the reconstruction and the mechanism for the OER process.									24	1	0	0	1	0	24			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000618153100034	33480252

Here, we report A-site lanthanum-doped oxygen-rich quinary oxide CaLaScRuO6+delta synthesized by adopting the solid-state reaction method and characterized by various techniques such as powder X-ray diffraction, neutron diffraction, energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, inductively coupled plasma-atomic emission spectrometry, Raman spectroscopy, and temperature-programmed reduction in the presence of a hydrogen atmosphere (H-2-TPR). X-ray absorption study confirms the existence of mixed valent Ru ions in the structure, which enhances the oxygen stoichiometry for the partial balance of an extra cationic charge. Neutron powder diffraction and reduction of the material in a hydrogen atmosphere (H-2-TPR) can confirm the oxygen overstoichiometry of the catalyst. The present material works as an efficient and robust oxygen bifunctional electrocatalyst for ORR/OER (oxygen evolution reaction/oxygen reduction reaction) followed by four-electron transfer pathway in a strong (1 M KOH) alkaline medium. The catalytic nature of the designed structural and chemical flexible perovskite is a novel example of an electrocatalyst for the oxygen bifunctional activity.									21	0	0	0	1	0	21			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000517360000023	32045211

However, the complex reaction mechanism of NiFe-catalyzed OER has not been fully explored yet. Detection of intermediate species can bridge the gap between OER performances and catalyst component/structure properties. Here, we performed label-free surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopic (SERS) monitoring of interfacial OER process on Ni3FeOx nanoparticles (NPs) in alkaline medium. By using bifunctional Au@Ni3FeOx core-satellite superstructures as Raman signal enhancer, we found direct spectroscopic evidence of intermediate O-O- species. According to the SERS results, Fe atoms are the catalytic sites for the initial OH- to O-O- oxidation. The O-O- species adsorbed across neighboring Fe and Ni sites experiences further oxidation caused by electron transfer to Ni-III and eventually forms O-2 product.									27	0	0	0	1	0	27			1433-7851	1521-3773		WOS:000678187400001	34184371

However, the sluggish kinetic process of oxygen evolution reaction (OER) involving four-electron proton coupling severely limits the improvement of electro-driven water splitting efficiency. High-efficiency and stable OER electrocatalysts can significantly improve the electrocatalytic activity, thereby improving the efficiency of electrocatalytic water splitting. Particularly, layered double hydroxides (LDHs) have received widespread attention due to their unique layer-stacking structure, tunable chemical composition and diversity of anion filling. Here, this review summarizes the recent strategies to design LDHs, including regulation of geometric morphology, construction of heterostructure, regulation of crystallinity, modulation of LDH composition, vacancy engineering, surfactant modification and crystal plane engineering. Moreover, future research methods and directions on LDHs oxygen evolution catalysts are also discussed.

Oxygen evolution reaction (OER) tests were carried out against the sacrificial oxidant cerium-(IV) ammonium nitrate (CAN), and higher TOF values were obtained for the treated samples in relation to the pure oxide, showing an influence of the Co3+/Co2+ ratio in the catalytic activity.

Among the spinel-type transition metal oxides, Cu0.7Co2.3O4 powders were evaluated as a potential replacement for expensive dimensionally stabilized anode materials. Cu0.7Co2.3O4 powder for use as an electrode material for oxygen evolution in an alkaline anion-exchange membrane water electrolyzer was prepared using a thermal decomposition method. The Cu0.7Co2.3O4 powders heat-treated at 250 A degrees C exhibited the same X-ray diffraction patterns without any secondary phases as the Co3O4 spinel structure did. The Cu0.7Co2.3O4 powders heat-treated at 250 A degrees C for 30 minutes showed the smallest mean particle size of approximately 376 nm with the powders having a homogeneous shape and size distribution. The fine powders with a relatively homogeneous size distribution showed a higher current density during the oxygen evolution reaction. The lifetime of the Cu0.7Co2.3O4 electrode was relatively long at a low current density, but was quickly shortened due to physical detachment of the Cu0.7Co2.3O4 powders as the current density was increased. This study showed that the efficiency and the stability of Cu0.7Co2.3O4 powders during the oxygen evolution reaction were related directly to the active electrode area.									3	0	0	0	0	0	4			0374-4884	1976-8524		WOS:000419615800009

It affords a current density of 10 mA/cm(2) at a small overpotential of 0.34 V, in 1 M KOH aqueous solution at room temperature. This enhanced OER activity may relate to the strong structural and effective electronic coupling between the single-crystal core and the shell.									45	5	0	0	2	0	46			1998-0124	1998-0000		WOS:000407860600017

The results show that an ion exchange membrane can effectively prevent Ag+ and Pb2+ from penetrating into the cathode chamber and depositing on the cathode. The addition of Ag+ in diaphragm electrolysis significantly lowers the overpotential of oxygen evolution reaction and improves the corrosion resistance of Pb and PbeAg (0.6 wt%) anodes. This is mainly attributed to the formation of Ag2O2 on the surface of the anode, which provides good catalytic activity for the oxygen evolution reaction (Ag2O2 can form Ag2O2 hydrate in sulfuric acid solution, Ag2O2 hydrate loses electrons and H+ during electrification, and then Ag2O2 is formed again after electron rearrangement).									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			0304-386X	1879-1158		WOS:000527360600008

Both electrode materials were phase pure with tetragonal structure of rutile type. Characteristic particle size estimated from XRD pattern ranged between 15 and 45 nm in the case of RuO2 and 20 and 60 nm in the case of Ru0.8Co0.2O2-x. Both electrode materials show acceptable stability in acid media and are active electrocatalysts for oxygen evolution. Despite similar structure and chemical composition the oxygen evolution on RuO2 is controlled by charge transfer processes; the oxygen evolution on Ru0.8Co0.2O2-x is controlled by chemical steps of the electrode process. The oxygen evolution is in both cases affected by the particle size. Increasing particle size suppresses oxygen evolution on RuO2, but enhances it on Ru0.8Co0.2O2-x anodes. The opposite trends in electrochemical behavior of RuO2 and Ru0.8Co0.2O2-x are attributed to a specific effect of cobalt, which substitutes the Ru in the structure of the surface.

The rational design of efficient electrocatalysts requires an in-depth understanding of the underlying mechanism and the structure-activity relationship of key electrocatalytic processes such as oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), oxygen evolution reaction (OER), hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CO2RR), and nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR). To gain a comprehensive understanding of these electrochemical systems, in situ characterization techniques capable of determining catalyst states as well as important reaction intermediates under operando conditions are necessary. Vibrational spectroscopic methods, including Raman and FTIR-based techniques, are powerful tools to monitor surface transformation, active sites, and interfacial intermediates under reaction conditions. Here, recent developments of in situ/operando vibrational spectroscopic techniques in the probing of various electrochemical reactions and processes are described and summarized. The outlook for future research directions in this field is also discussed. The aim is to attract increasing attention of the wider community to in situ/operando characterization techniques and promote the fundamental understanding of reaction mechanisms and structure-activity relationships in electrocatalytic energy conversion systems.

Investigation of stable and highly efficient electrocatalysts for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is targeted in this study at cobalt oxide nanoparticle modified glassy carbon (nano-CoOx/GC) electrodes. The effect of the preparation (T-p) and measuring temperature (T-m) on the electrocatalytic activity of nano-CoOx/GC towards the OER is investigated under various operating conditions. Linear sweep voltammetry (LSV), cyclic voltammetry (CV) as well as SEM and XRD techniques were used to probe the electrocatalytic and morphological characteristics of nano-CoOx prepared under various conditions. Increasing T-p and/or T-m results in improving the kinetics and electrocatalytic activity of the proposed anodes towards the OER as demonstrated in the value of the the onset potential of the OER and the OER currents recorded at a fixed potential. The morphology as well as the surface characterization of the prepared catalyst are reported herein and evaluated.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			1452-3981			WOS:000551732800045

The screening process significantly accelerates the discovery of new promising materials without the need of time-consuming real-cell analysis. In commonly employed tests, a conclusion on the catalyst stability is drawn solely on the basis of electrochemical data, for example, by evaluating potential-versus-time profiles. Herein important limitations of such approaches, which are related to the degradation of the backing electrode material, are demonstrated. State-of-the-art Ir-black powder is investigated for OER activity and for dissolution as a function of the backing electrode material. Even at very short time intervals materials like glassy carbon passivate, increasing the contact resistance and concealing the degradation phenomena of the electrocatalyst itself. Alternative backing electrodes like gold and boron-doped diamond show better stability and are thus recommended for short accelerated aging investigations. Moreover, parallel quantification of dissolution products in the electrolyte is shown to be of great importance for comparing OER catalyst feasibility.									74	1	0	0	1	0	74			1864-5631	1864-564X		WOS:000414810200003	28922570

Specifically, the in-situ synthesized NiCo2S4 NPs confined in cages of CNNs create a well-defined electron transfer hetero-interface with more exposed active sites. The combined NiCo2S4 NPs with the CNNs generate a synergistic effect, which provides effective electron transfer pathways to enhance the electrocatalytic behaviors, yielding a more positive half-wave potential (0.83 V) for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and a lower overpotential (360 mV at 10 mA cm(-2)) for oxygen evolution reaction (OER). As a proof of concept, the equipped ZABs exhibit a high peak power density of 92 mW cm(-2) and a superior energy density of 1025 Wh kg(-1) with robust cycling stability over 1000 cycles for 180 h, which are better than that of a commercially available Pt/C-RuO2 catalyst. The findings highlight the practical viability of the NiCo2S4/CNNs composites in rechargeable ZABs and provide a new approach for the efficient synthesis of bifunctional oxygen electrocatalyst in the future.

Catalytic sites, while effective in lowering reaction barriers, often become deactivated when placed on the surface of an oxygen electrode due to passivation by solid products. Here we investigate a mechanism for alleviating catalyst deactivation by dispersing Pd catalytic sites away from the oxygen electrode surface in a well-structured anodic aluminum oxide (AAO) porous membrane interlayer. We observe the cross-sectional product growth and evolution in Li-O-2 cells by characterizing products that grow from the electrode surface. Morphological and structural details of the products in both catalyzed and uncatalyzed cells are investigated independently from the influence of the oxygen electrode. We find that the geometric decoration of catalysts from the conductive electrode surface significantly improves the reaction reversibility by chemically facilitating the oxidation reaction through local coordination with PdO surfaces. The influence of the catalyst position on product composition is further verified by ex situ X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and Raman spectroscopy in addition to morphological studies.									20	0	0	0	1	0	20			1530-6984	1530-6992		WOS:000381331900010	27326464

During the solvothermal synthesis of NiFe-LDH, the organic ligand decomposes and transforms to amorphous carbon with graphitic nanodomains by catalytic effect of Fe. The confined growth of both NiFe-LDH and carbon in one single sheet results in fully integrated amorphous NiFe-LDH/C nanohybrid, allowing the harness of the high intrinsic activity of NiFe-LDH due to (i) amorphous and distorted LDH structure, (ii) enhanced active surface area, and (iii) strong coupling between the active phase and carbon. As such, the resultant NiFe-LDH/C exhibits superior activity and stability. Different from postdeposition or electrostatic self-assembly process for the formation of LDH/C composite, this method offers one new opportunity to fabricate high-performance oxygen evolution reaction and possibly other catalysts.									159	14	0	0	12	0	159			0935-9648	1521-4095		WOS:000423793100019	29226560

Following electrochemical adsorption of oxygen species, ZZ edges with S-coverage are found to undergo surface oxidation that significantly reduces the percentage of S-coverage under applied oxidative potential. The most stable morphology at the relevant potential for oxygen evolution corresponds to the oxygenated ZZ-Mo-edge with 0% S-coverage. Depending upon the reaction site, different concerted catalytic pathways are observed on this edge, with minimum thermodynamic overpotential values varying between 0.5 and 0.8 V. By performing a systematic exploration of the edge reactivity, optimal two-site catalytic pathways are observed, for which the OER overpotentials are found to be considerably reduced compared to the basal plane and S-covered ZZ edges.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			1932-7447	1932-7455		WOS:000655640900022

However, designing the catalyst with enhanced electrocatalytic activity remains one of the major challenges. Here, we examined the oxygen evolution reaction activities of geometrically designed (with and without step-textured morphology) thin films of an electrocatalytically active correlated metallic SrRuO3 perovskite grown on c- and r-plane sapphire substrates. On c-plane sapphire, as compared to the uniform surface, the step-textured films endowed with active Ru-sites show remarkable decrease in the overpotential (similar to 25 mV). Interestingly, the behavior is opposite for the r-plane case, highlighting the significance of the active sites, in addition with the polar surface termination of selective crystal facets. Density functional theory calculation confirms the favorable energy reaction pathway for the active site dependent enhancement in OER. Our strategy might pave the way towards designing the surfaces of various oxide thin films for high performance energy conversion based devices.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000564114000013

Recent research studies have mostly focused on the traditional methods to tune the OER performance, such as cation/anion doping, A-/B-site ordering, epitaxial strain, oxygen vacancy, and so forth, leading to reasonable yet still limited activity enhancement. Here, we report a novel strategy for promoting the OER activity for perovskite LaNiO3 by crystal phase engineering, which is realized by breaking long-range chemical bonding through amorphization. We provide the first and direct evidence that perovskite oxides with an amorphous structure can induce the self-adaptive process, which helps enhance the OER performance. This is evidenced by the fact that an amorphous LaNiO3 film on glassy carbon shows a 9-fold increase in the current density compared to that of an epitaxial LaNiO3 single crystalline film. The obtained current density of 1038 mu A cm(-2) (@a 1.6 vs RHE) is the largest value among the literature reported values.

So far no OER mechanism has been fully explained atomistically with both thermodynamic and kinetics. IrO2 is the only known OER catalyst with both high catalytic activity and stability in acidic conditions. This is important because PEC experiments often operate at extreme pH conditions. In this work, we performed first-principles calculations integrated with implicit solvation at constant potentials to examine the detailed atomistic reaction mechanism of OER at the IrO2 (110) surface. We determined the surface phase diagram, explored the possible reaction pathways including kinetic barriers, and computed reaction rates based on the microkinetic models. This allowed us to resolve several long-standing puzzles about the atomistic OER mechanism.									169	1	0	0	17	0	169			0002-7863			WOS:000392036900031	27936679

Herein, the alpha phase nickel-iron oxyhydroxide (alpha-NiFeOxHy) rich of nickel active edge sites is electrochemically in situ generated from Fe-square acid metal-organic framework precursor deposited on nickel-containing electrode matrixes, which revealed superior oxygen evolution reaction performance signified by an overpotential of 167 mV to achieve a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) in alkaline electrolytes. Notably, the as-prepared metal oxyhydroxide exhibits long-term electrochemical durability in 10 mA cm(-2) for over 1080 h. By integrating the electrochemical evidence, Mossbauer spectroscopy, X-Ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and density functional theory calculations, the nickel species enriched on the exposed edge facet of the as-synthesized alpha-NiFeOxHy are proposed to be the highly catalytic active site. This work provides an expedient and energy-efficient approach to in situ electrochemical fabrication of high-performance NiFeOxHy oxygen evolution reaction catalysts from metal-organic frameworks.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0				2688-4062		WOS:000821629300001

Owing to the negatively charged surface, graphene oxide can preferably adsorb Co2+ in the initial solution, subsequently inducing the in-situ nucleation and growth of the Co3O4 nanocubes at the elevated hydrothermal temperature. During this process, the graphene oxide is reduced to graphene, thus the fabrication of the Co3O4/G composite is finished. Compared with the Co3O4 irregular particles, the Co3O4/G composite shows enhanced electrocatalytic performance for oxygen evolution, resulting from more active sites and higher charge-transfer efficiency.

Nitrogen-agitation is less efficient at promoting this product removal. In contrast, oxygen gas evolution from the same electrode in 1M H2SO4 not only fails to be enhanced by ultrasound in these conditions, but the electrode continues to be deactivated by oxidative processes on successive scans despite sonication. Thus sonoelectrochemistry probes mechanistic distinction between these reaction systems. Copyright (C) 1996 Elsevier Science Ltd.									41	2	0	0	2	0	45			0013-4686			WOS:A1996VE19900011

Herein, the design of a multilayered oxygen-evolution electrode is reported to meet the multiple needs of anode material for saline water splitting. The multilayered electrode is synthesized through direct thermal boronization of commercially available NiFe alloy plate with boron powder, followed by electrochemical oxidation. And this electrode is composed of the surface oxidized NiFeBx alloy layer, the NiFeBx alloy interlayer, and the NiFe alloy substrate. The boron species are present in the form of metaborate in the outermost oxidized NiFeBx layer, and their existence is conductive to the generation and stabilization of the catalytic active phase gamma-(Ni,Fe)OOH. The introduction of NiFeBx interlayer effectively prevents the excessive oxidative corrosion of the anode material in the electrolyte containing chloride ions.									40	2	0	0	0	0	40			1616-301X	1616-3028		WOS:000642316900001

In this study, thermal subtraction method and six sets of characteristic temperatures were introduced to explore the intrinsic reaction between coal and oxygen which provides the main heat source responsible for coal self-heating. The heat evolution and mass change during coal spontaneous combustion were measured in real time using a sensitive differential scanning calorimeter (DSC) and a thermogravimetric analyzer (TG), respectively. The DSC and TG subtraction curves obtained from subtracting the results of nitrogen atmosphere from those of air atmosphere can reveal the heat change and mass change due only to the reaction between coal and oxygen. The term of q/m defined as the amount of heat release by the change of per unit of coal mass was introduced to study the intrinsic relationship between heat evolution and mass change during coal spontaneous combustion. The q/m values of the three coals show different evolution trends as coal temperature increases and are related to the mechanism of coal spontaneous combustion. The kinetics analysis of this intrinsic relationship was also carried out based on experimental data. Moreover, q/m can be used in the evaluation of spontaneous combustion propensity with respect to different coal types.									5	0	0	0	1	0	5			0010-2202	1563-521X		WOS:000524042300001

Recently, several alternative reaction mechanisms with lower overpotentials were proposed for highly active catalysts. While for such reaction mechanisms additional intermediates leading to nonelectrochemical reaction steps could be considered, they are usually neglected when the thermodynamic overpotential of such mechanisms is investigated. We show here that this is a valid approximation for endothermic nonelectrochemical steps, which only affect the kinetics, while exothermic nonelectrochemical steps can also affect the thermodynamic overpotential. We show this on the basis of density functional theory calculations for one of those proposed mechanisms on surfaces of different perovskite oxides and oxynitrides. We find that for weakly binding surfaces the *O adsorbate spontaneously adopts a bidentate bridged dimer structure in a nonelectrochemical step with an energy gain in excess of 1 eV. This decrease in free energy needs to be compensated by an equivalent increase in magnitude of the electrochemical steps, which can affect the thermodynamic overpotential. This change may result in reaction mechanisms without nonelectrochemical steps having smaller thermodynamic overpotentials and thus being more favorable.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2155-5435			WOS:000743174500001

The metallic Co nanoparticles with abundant exposed active sites are segregated uniformly on VN nanosheets in situ so that they adhere strongly to the VN substrate leading to accelerated charge transfer and enhanced stability. The carbon shell of the composite acts as a buffer layer to alleviate the volume expansion and the battery shows a stable capacity of 335.5 mAh g(-1) after 500 cycles at 0.5 A g(-1). After testing at different rates, the current density reverts back to 0.1 A g(-1) and the capacity of the Co-VN@C electrode returns to 588.0 mAh g(-1). Besides, Co-VN@C has excellent electrochemical catalytic activity in the oxygen evolution reaction. This work sheds light on the long cycle stability and high rate capacity electrode materials for future development of LIBs and the strategy provides insights into the design of high-performance electrode materials for electrochemical catalysis.									12	0	0	0	0	0	12			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000580627000118

Herein, we prepared an atomically dispersed cobalt coordinated with oxygen and sulfur species on the conductive polymer polythiophene (PTh) via Co-S bond as a stable noble-metal-free electrocatalyst for the OER. A novel cobalt-based catalytic site structure, CoxOyS4, is successfully fabricated. The resulting electrocatalyst, Co@PTh, exhibits an excellent OER performance with overpotential of 338 mV versus reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) and the Tafel slope of 52 mV dec(-1) in alkaline electrolyte. This performance is better than that of the commercial RuO2 and even comparable with the state-of-the-art catalyst IrO2.

However, the high OER overpotential reduces the efficiency of water splitting and becomes the bottleneck of water splitting technology. The exploration of highly efficient OER electrocatalysts and small overpotential reaction is crucial to develop the water splitting technology. Here the defective (Ni - Co) Ox/NiCo2S4 3D heterogeneous nanosheets were successfully prepared by hydrothermal method, and their catalytic activity for OER was tested. (Ni- Co)O,/NiCo2S4 shows excellent OER catalytic activity in alkaline medium (1 moVL KOH). The overpotential is 370 mV at current density of 10 mA . cm-2.

The evolution of pore structure was characterized by quenched solid density functional theory(QSDFT)method using nitrogen adsorption and the surface ablation by scanning electronic microscopy(SEM). The results indicate that the absorption isotherms of semi-char samples possess some fea-tures of isotherms of typesⅠ andⅣ. Appropriate oxygen concentration and steam concentration are beneficial to the development of pore structure. The mechanism of oxygen and steam is different during the preparation of active semi-char. Oxygen is involved in the reaction on the surface and its surface ablation is stronger,while steam is involved in the reaction in the pores.			采用烟煤为原料,在沉降炉试验台上研究快速加热条件下,水蒸气和氧气复合气氛对活性半焦孔隙结构的影响。通过氮气吸附、骤冷固体密度泛函方法研究活性半焦孔隙结构的演化,通过扫描电镜的方法研究活性半焦的表面烧蚀特性。结果表明,活性半焦的低吸附等温线的类型具备Ⅰ型和Ⅳ型等温线的特征。一定体积分数氧气与水蒸气对孔隙结构发展都有促进作用。氧气与水蒸气在活性半焦制备过程中作用机理不同,氧气参与表面反应,水蒸气参与孔隙中反应,氧气对表面烧蚀作用强。						1	3	0	0	0	0	4			1006-8740			CSCD:5525910

The highest OER current density was recorded at Co coating with a low Tafel slope of 60 mV.dec(-1). Furthermore, these coatings proved to be stable under HER and OER polarization conditions.									7	0	0	0	0	0	7				1996-1944		WOS:000606220000001	33379230

Iridium oxide/graphitic carbon nitride (IrO2/GCN) heterostructures are designed with low-coordinate IrO2 nanoparticles (NPs) confined on superhydrophilic highly stable GCN nanosheets for efficient acidic OER. The GCN nanosheets not only ensure the homogeneous distribution and confinement of IrO2 NPs but also endows the heterostructured catalyst system with a superhydrophilic surface, which can maximize the exposure of active sites and promotes mass diffusion. The coordination number of Ir atoms is decreased owing to the strong interaction between IrO2 and GCN, leading to lattice strain and increment of electron density around Ir sites and hence modulating the attachment between the catalyst and reaction intermediates. The optimized IrO2/GCN heterostructure delivers not only by far the highest mass activity among the reported IrO2-based catalysts but also decent durability.									120	8	0	0	7	0	121			1433-7851	1521-3773		WOS:000481305400001	31318124

Herein we report a facile and direct route for synthesizing spinel NiCo2O4 nanostructure on conductive substrates by electrospray technique. By simply altering the substrate temperature, film thickness and voltage, NiCo2O4 with different morphology and electrocatalytic performance was obtained. The optimal performance showed a low overpotential of 375 mV at 10 mA/cm(2) and an excellent stability over 15 h.

Thermal treatment in the temperature range of 473-773 K was applied in order to obtain a stable oxide structure. The synthesized coatings were examined for their electrocatalytic application in both oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) under alkaline conditions. These tests proved coating bifunctionality in water splitting half reactions along with their long-term stability. A multiple composition with a variety of oxo-species and oxidation states promotes coating application as pseudocapacitors by storing electric charge through the Faradaic reactions on the surface. During capacitance tests, copper-cobalt oxide films exhibited specific power as high as 1000 W kg(-1) at 1 A g(-1) current density.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1868-2529	1868-5994		WOS:000761840800001

Here, this study reports its findings in the development of a nanostructured perovskite oxide as OER/HER bifunctional electrocatalyst for overall water splitting. Prepared by a facile electrospinning method, SrNb0.1Co0.7Fe0.2O3- perovskite nanorods (SNCF-NRs) display excellent OER and HER activity and stability in an alkaline solution, benefiting from the catalytic nature of perovskites and unique structural features. More importantly, the SNCF-NR delivers a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at a cell voltage of merely approximate to 1.68 V while maintaining remarkable durability when used as both anodic and cathodic catalysts in an alkaline water electrolyzer. The performance of this bifunctional perovskite material is among the best ever reported for overall water splitting, offering a cost-effective alternative to noble metal based electrocatalysts.									283	13	0	0	14	0	284			1614-6832	1614-6840		WOS:000399721700013

In ether-based electrolytes, the CaMnO3/C cathode exhibits a high discharge capacity of 9560 mA h g(-1) at a current density of 100 mA g(-1), high rate capability (a capacity of 1940 mA h g(-1) at 1000 mA g(-1)), and considerable cyclability up to 80 cycles. Two discharged species of NaO2 and Na2O2 are detected at the discharged state. The remarkable electrocatalytic activity of CaMnO3 both for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is attributed to the porous micro-nanostructures in stable ether-based electrolytes.									74	6	0	0	2	0	74			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000349447200014

Owing to the structural and compositional advantages, the optimized trimetallic NiCo2-xFexO4 NBs (x is about 0.117) deliver superior electrocatalytic performance for OER with an overpotential of 274 mV at 10 mA cm(-2), a small Tafel slope of 42 mV dec(-1), and good stability in alkaline electrolyte, which is much better than that of Co-based bi/monometallic spinel oxides and even commercial RuO2.									107	1	0	0	4	0	108			1433-7851	1521-3773		WOS:000640175200001	33739587

However, complete stoichiometric oxidation is very difficult to realize experimentally in almost all cases there are significant fractions of oxygen vacancies present. Here, using first-principles calculations we study oxygen vacancies in perovskite SrCoO3 from thermodynamic, electronic, and kinetic points of view. We find that an oxygen vacancy donates two electrons to neighboring Co sites in the form of localized charge. The formation energy of a single vacancy is very low and is estimated to be 1.26 eV in the dilute limit. We find that a vacancy is quite mobile with a migration energy of similar to 0.5 eV. Moreover, we predict that oxygen vacancies exhibit a tendency toward clustering, which is in accordance with the material's ability to form a variety of oxygen-deficient structures. These vacancies have a profound effect on the material's ability to facilitate OER, increasing the overpotential from similar to 0.3 V for the perfect material to similar to 0.7 V for defective surfaces. A moderate compressive biaxial strain (2%) is predicted here to increase the surface oxygen vacancy formation energy by ca. 30%, thus reducing the concentration of surface vacancies and thereby preserving the OER activity of the material.									70	1	0	0	1	0	71			2155-5435			WOS:000381236700086

In this work, efforts are devoted to exploring a new flexible structure that is competent in providing large amounts of oxygen vacancies as well as offering the freedom to manipulate the electronic structure of metal cations. This is demonstrated by anchoring low valence state Co at high valence state Nb sites in the tetragonal tungsten bronze (TTB)-structured Sr0.5Ba0.5Nb2-xCoxO6-delta, with different ratios of Co to Nb to optimize the Co substitution proportion. It is found that the occupation of Co in the Nb(5+)sites gives rise to the generation of massive surface oxygen vacancies (O-vac), while Co itself is stabilized in Co(2+)by adjacent O-vac. The coexistence of O(vac)and LS Co(2+)enables an oxygen intercalation mechanism in the optimal SBNC45 with specific activity at 1.7 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode that is 20 times higher than for the commercial IrO2. This work illuminates an entirely new avenue to rationally design OER electrocatalysts with ultrafast kinetics.									8	0	0	0	1	0	8				2198-3844		WOS:000573387400001	33240771

However, its sluggish kinetics usually results in large voltage polarization and unnecessary energy loss. Therefore, designing efficient catalysts that could facilitate this process has become an emerging topic. Here, we present a unique Pt-Cu core-shell nanostructure for catalyzing the nonaqueous OER. The catalysts were systematically investigated with comprehensive spectroscopic techniques, and applied in nonaqueous Li-O-2 electrochemical cells, which exhibited dramatically reduced charging overpotential (<0.2 V). The superior performance is explained by the robust Cu(I) surface sites stabilized by the Pt core in the nanostructure. The insights into the catalytic mechanism of the unique Pt-Cu core-shell nanostructure gained in this work are expected to serve as a guide for future design of other nanostructured bimetallic OER catalysts.									36	1	0	0	0	0	36			1530-6984	1530-6992		WOS:000368322700119	26709945

Following potential cycling to positive potential upon which oxidation of Pt is barely observable in contrast to Au, which is characterized by a well-defined oxidation wave, both electrodes showed on the return scan a cathodic wave corresponding to the electrochemical reduction of corresponding metal oxides. In the potential region more negative than about 0 V, voltammograms recorded by avoiding scanning to a positive potential limit reaching the onset of the oxygen evolution reaction, show no well-defined cathodic waves prior to hydrogen evolution reaction. This provides strong evidence that TFSI anions are not electrochemically reduced in this potential region at Pt, Au and glassy carbon electrodes. Furthermore, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy measurements of electrode surface, following potential cycling to a value negative enough to reach the onset of hydrogen evolution, showed formation of surface layer with a high fluorine/sulfur ratio (higher than 3 expected for TFSI) that could be explained by chemical degradation of TFSI by species generated during hydrogen evolution with preferential dissolution of sulfur-based compounds.									8	0	0	0	0	0	8			1572-6657	1873-2569		WOS:000502883500006

Moreover, even if the mechanism by which nitrogen improves the activities is not completely understood, a strong electronic interaction between nitrogen and active sites has been found in these composites. Herein, we demonstrate a case in which nitrogen improves the electroactivity, but in the absence of a strong interaction with other components. The overpotentials of the ORR and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) on perovskite oxide catalysts were significantly reduced simply by mixing the catalyst particles with polypyrrole/carbon composites (pPy/C). Any strong interactions between pPy (a nitrogen-containing compound) and active sites of the catalysts are not confirmed. A scenario based on the sequential task allocation between pPy and oxide catalysts for the ORR was proposed: (1) molecular oxygen is incorporated into pPy as a form of superoxide (pPy(+)O(2)(-)), (2) the superoxide is transferred to the active sites of perovskite catalysts, and (3) the superoxide is completely reduced along the 4e ORR process.									52	1	0	0	1	0	53			1754-5692	1754-5706		WOS:000395679100010

Single atom catalysts (SACs) derived from metal-organic framework (MOF) are emerging extraordinary materials in electrochemical catalytic applications. Covering the merits of unique electronic structure, low-coordination environment, quantum size effect, and metal-support interaction, SACs promise enhanced electrocatalytic activity, stability, and selectivity in the field of clean energy conversion. In this article, MOF synthesis routes to afford well-dispersed SACs along with the respective synthesis mechanism are systematically reviewed first, and typical examples of each strategy are carefully discussed. Then the characterization techniques in understanding the isolated and spatial distribution, local electronic structure, coordination environment for SACs, and insights into stable mechanisms provided by density functional theory (DFT) calculations are summarized. In addition, several important electrocatalytic applications and electrocatalytic mechanisms of the MOF-derived SACs, including for the oxygen reduction reaction, CO(2)reduction reaction, nitrogen reduction reaction, hydrogen evolution reaction, oxygen evolution reaction, etc., are highlighted. To facilitate the future development of high-performing SACs, several technical challenges and corresponding research directions are proposed.									135	14	0	0	12	0	136			1614-6832	1614-6840		WOS:000558845500001

Because of the strong electronic interaction between the components of Co-CoMoSx, Co-CoMoSx nanosheet arrays show an outstanding electrocatalytic oxygen evolution performance (Tafel slope b = 64.79 mV dec(-1), eta(100) = 292 mV, eta(1000) = 402 mV) and remarkable stability in alkaline solution. Remarkably, the Co-CoMoSx||PS-MoNi (phase-separated Mo-Ni alloy) electrolytic cell can facilitate water splitting at a low voltage of 1.48 V to deliver a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) and exhibits durability for up to 150 hours. This study puts forward a promising direction for the synthesis of high performance heterostructure catalysts for oxygen evolution.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2398-4902			WOS:000864801000001

Iron based electrodes are attractive candidates, but elevating their activity faces great challenges in weak intermediate adsorption. Herein, we demonstrated that ultrathin FeP nanosheets with Fe defects on nickel foam (FeP-NS/NF) exhibited a remarkable electrocatalytic oxygen evolution performance. The overpotential of FeP-NS/NF only requires 220 mV to achieve a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) in 1 M KOH solution. Moreover, it possessed excellent durability during the 85 h stability test. Fe defects over ultrathin FeP evidenced by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and electron spin resonance (ESR) have been experimentally demonstrated to promote oxygenated intermediate adsorption, which largely reduce the overpotential of OER.									27	1	0	0	0	0	27			2574-0962			WOS:000529190300053

Water, a green solvent, provided hydrogen and the photocatalyst Pd-g-C3N4 facilitated hydrogenation with excellent yield and selectivity for a wide range of olefins and nitro compounds (>99%). The robust catalyst is stable with excellent reusability for five consecutive runs. Besides recognition for its excellent photocatalytic ability, Pd-g-C3N4 has also been introduced as an efficient bifunctional electrocatalyst towards overall water splitting (both the hydrogen evolution and the oxygen evolution reaction) with excellent durability; it can catalyze both half-cell reactions in the same media (0.5 M H2SO4 solution) with Tafel slopes for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) for the catalyst being 36 and 72 mV dec(-1), respectively. The enhanced catalytic activities may be due to the synergistic effect among Pd and C and N of the C3N4 material. These findings point to a promising pathway to assemble a robust and efficient catalyst for both photochemical and electrochemical reactions and pave a new avenue for the development of a bifunctional photo/electrocatalyst for hydrogenation and overall water splitting.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			1463-9262	1463-9270		WOS:000815218400001

Chalcogenophosphites, also designated as metal phosphorus chalcogenides (MPX), have attracted great interest because of not only their magnetic properties but also promising capabilities in energy applications. Herein, bulk crystals of different layered metal triselenophosphites, with a general formula MPSe3 (M = Cd, Cr, Fe, Mn, Sn, Zn), were synthesized. Structural and morphological characterization was performed prior to testing their electrochemical performance. From the set of ternary layered materials, FePSe3(,) followed by MnPSe3, yielded the highest efficiency for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) both in acidic and alkaline media with good stability after 100 cycles. MnPSe3 also holds the lowest oxidation potential for cysteine, although this is due to the presence of MnO2 in the structure as detected by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. For the oxygen evolution reaction, the best performance was observed for FePSe3, although the stability of the material was not as good as in the case of HER. These findings have profound implications in the application of these layered ternary compounds in energy-related fields.									50	1	0	0	1	0	50			2155-5435			WOS:000417230500016

There is a need for cheaper and more efficient catalysts for this process. Ni hydroxide-based OER catalysts are promising, but further research is required. This paper describes the use of a simple chemical bath deposition method for the preparation and characterization of three-dimensional microstructured Ni-Fe hydroxide electrochemical OER catalysts on nickel plates. The influences of the Fe ion content and pH of the chemical bath on the performance of the catalysts are addressed, allowing the preparation of an efficient and highly active catalyst.

EDTA serves not only as a resource to tune the morphology in terms of the complexation constant for M-EDTA, but also as a nitrogen and oxygen source for nitrogen doping and metal oxide formation, respectively. When the materials are used as electrocatalysts for the oxygen electrode reaction, Co@CoO/NDC-700 and MnO/NDC-700 show superior electrocatalytic activity towards the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), while Co@CoO/NDC-700 and Ni@NiO/NDC-700 exhibit excellent oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activities. Taken together, the resultant Co@CoO/NDC-700 exhibits the best catalytic activity with favorable reaction kinetics and durability as a bi-functional catalyst for the ORR and OER, which is much better than the other two catalysts, Pt/C and Ir/C. Moreover, as an air electrode for a homemade zinc-air battery, Co@CoO/NDC700 shows superior cell performance with a highest power density of 192.1 mW cm(-2), the lowest charge-discharge overpotential and high charge-discharge durability over 100 h.									22	0	0	0	0	0	22			2398-4902			WOS:000422783100015

Activation of the inert basal plane of TMDs is crucial to improving the catalytic efficiency. Herein, introduction of in-plane sulfur vacancies (S-v) and 3d transition metal dopants in concert activates the basal planes of MoS2 (M-S-v-MoS2) to achieve high activities in the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Acetate introducing mild wet chemical etching removes surface S atoms facilitating subsequent cation exchange between the exposed Mo atoms and targeted metal ions in solution. Density-functional theory calculation demonstrates that the exposed 3d transition metal dopants in MoS2 basal planes serve as multifunctional active centers, which not only reduce Delta G(H*) but also accelerate water oxidation. As a result, the optimal Ni-S-v-MoS2 and Co-S-v-MoS2 electrocatalysts show excellent stability and alkaline HER and OER characteristics such as low overpotentials of 101 and 190 mV at 10 mA cm(-2), respectively. The results reveal a strategy to activate the inert MoS2 basal planes by defect and doping co-engineering and the technique can be extended to other types of TMDs for high-efficiency electrocatalysis beyond water splitting.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1613-6810	1613-6829		WOS:000844805400001	36026534

Herein, a series of homonuclear and heteronuclear transition metals and nitrogen codoped graphene (M,N-6-Gra, FeMN6-Gra, M = Ru, Rh, Pd, Ag) serving as bifunctional electrocatalysts for ORR and OER are investigated by means of the density functional method. For ORR, FeRhN6-Gra has the best performance. The formation of *OH is the rate-determining step with a low energy barrier of 0.40 eV (compared with 0.80 eV for pure Pt) and a small overpotential of 0.26 V. For OER, Pd2N6-Gra has the best catalytic activity with a small overpotential of 0.30 V, followed by 0.43 V for FeRhN6-Gra. Therefore, FeRhN6-Gra shows excellent bifunctional catalytic activity toward both ORR and OER. Further experimental study of this compound should be rewarding. Interestingly, the ratio between electronegativity and the atomic radius of transition metals is found to be a good descriptor for evaluating the catalytic activity.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			1932-7447	1932-7455		WOS:000529873300007

However, the activity still needs further improvement and related fundamentals remain untouched. The fact that spinel oxides tend to form cation deficiencies can differentiate their electrocatalysis from other oxide materials, for example, the most studied oxygen-deficient perovskites. Here, a systematic study of spinel ZnFexCo2-xO4 oxides (x = 0-2.0) toward the OER is presented and a highly active catalyst superior to benchmark IrO2 is developed. The distinctive OER activity is found to be dominated by the metal-oxygen covalency and an enlarged CoO covalency by 10-30 at% Fe substitution is responsible for the activity enhancement. While the pH-dependent OER activity of ZnFe0.4Co1.6O4 (the optimal one) indicates decoupled proton-electron transfers during the OER, the involvement of lattice oxygen is not considered as a favorable route because of the downshifted O p-band center relative to Fermi level governed by the spinel's cation deficient nature.									214	17	0	0	15	0	215			0935-9648	1521-4095		WOS:000440813300029	29939436

Here, we report a facile fabrication of a series of cobalt-nickel phosphide nanowires (CoNiP NWs) containing different compositions of Co and Ni, which is accomplished by hydrothermal growth of cobalt-nickel-carbonate-hydroxide NWs and a subsequent post-phosphorization treatment. We investigate and compare the electrocatalytic performance of the CoNiP NWs for the OER and HER in alkaline solution. The results show that CoNiP NWs with equimol Co and Ni, i.e. CoNiP-1:1, show the best apparent and intrinsic activities for both OER and HER, compared to CoNiP NWs with other Co/Ni ratios as well as the mono-metallic CoP and Ni5P4 controls. The CoNiP-1:1 can deliver the benchmark apparent current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at an overpotential of 301 and 252 mV for the OER and the HER, respectively, and show good stability over 24 h without obvious degradation, holding substantial promise for use as an effective and inexpensive alternative in alkaline water electrolysis.									30	3	0	0	1	0	30			0920-5861	1873-4308		WOS:000600845700011

In this work, cobalt and tungsten dual metal-loaded N-doped porous carbon electrocatalysts derived from silk fibroin were successfully prepared through facile carbonization and chemical activation by KCl and applied as efficient electrocatalysts for HER and OER. After chemical activation, the resulting catalysts present a unique hierarchical porous structure with micro-, meso-, and macropores, which is able to expose more implantation sites for catalytic active metals and will in turn promote the efficient diffusion of the electrolyte. The catalyst under the optimized condition (CoW@ ACSF) has a specific area of 326.01 m(2) g(-1). The overpotential at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) of CoW@ACSF is 138.42 +/- 10.39 mV toward HER and 492.05 +/- 19.04 mV toward OER. Furthermore, the overpotential only increases 101.2 mV toward HER and 66.00 mV toward OER after the long-term stability test of chronopotentiometric test over 10 h, which confirms the excellent stability of the CoW@ACSF, owing to its unique carbon shell structure. This work gives an insight into the design and engineering of silk fibroin-derived carbon materials for electrocatalysis toward HER and OER.									5	0	0	0	1	0	5			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000672492800040	34167298

Herein, the ionic modulation of cobalt pentlandite coupled with nitrogen-doped bowl-like hollow carbon sphere is well designed on octahedral and tetrahedral sites. The robust FexCo9-xS8-NHCS-V with iron replacing at the octahedron possesses prolonged metal sulfur bond and exhibits excellent bifunctional electrocatalytic performance towards oxygen reduction reaction (ORR, E-1/2 = 0.80 V vs. RHE) and excellent oxygen evolution reaction (OER, E-j=10 = 1.53 V vs. RHE) in 0.1 mol/L KOH. Accordingly, a rechargeable Zn-air battery of FexCo9-xS8-NHCS-V cathode endows high energy efficiency (102 mW cm(-2)), and a microbial fuel cell achieves a high-power density (791 +/- 42 mW m(-2)), outperforming the benchmark Pt/C catalyst.

Combining electrochemical flow cell measurements with online mass spectrometry analysis (differential electrochemical mass spectrometry) allows us to separate catalytic O-2 evolution from other electrochemical reactions such as catalyst oxidation. Materials with different nitridation levels were fabricated via thermal treatment of titanium oxide in gaseous ammonia. The resulting materials, which cover a wide range of O:N ratios, were characterized by X-ray diffraction, elemental carbon-hydrogen-nitrogen analysis, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, yielding information about bulk crystallinity, chemical composition, and surface species present, respectively. They show increasing oxidation current densities starting at about 1.2 V, with a peak maximum at 1.7 V. Online mass spectrometry analysis, however, reveals that this current results from oxidation of the electrode surface rather than from O-2 evolution, while O-2 evolution occurs only at potentials > 1.7 V. Increasing nitride contents were found to increase the electrochemical electrode oxidation reaction, while the onset of O-2 evolution is independent of the extent of nitridation. Consequences of these findings on the suitability of these materials as OER catalysts will be discussed. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

However, most of the high-efficiency catalysts reported to date only are catalytically active for either the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) or the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), which makes the development of multifunctional catalysts more meaningful. Here, for the first time, Co(CO3)(0.5)OH(.)0.11 H2O (CHCH) as precursor with different microstructures on the surface of nickel foam (NF) was obtained using a facile hydrothermal method. The CoP/NF catalyst was obtained after thermal phosphating that retained the microhierarchical structure of the precursor and greatly improved the catalytic performance, with a highly efficiency performance as HER and OER dual-functional catalyst. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations showed that the possible reason for the excellent performance of the CoP/NF layered structure is an increase in the number of of surface defects and an increased active surface area. The results reported in this paper show that CoP/NF, a layered bifunctional electrocatalyst, is a cost-effective and efficient water-splitting electrode. This finding can offer the opportunity for the commercial use of excess electric energy for large-scale water splitting hydrogen production.									9	1	0	0	0	0	10			1864-5631	1864-564X		WOS:000605419600001	33369250

In view of this, the present work is focused on the synthesis of mixed-phase (2H/1T) molybdenum sulfide (MoS2) using a simple facile hydrothermal method followed by its impregnation with CuO and doping with ruthenium. The nanostructured Ru-doped CuO/MoS2 (MSCR) prepared in this manner has been characterized and studied for HER and OER in an alkaline medium. The MSCR catalyst showed overpotentials of similar to 198 mV, 201 mV, and 1.68 V to achieve 10 mA/cm(2) current density in HER, OER, and overall water splitting. respectively. Tafel slopes of MSCR in HER (113 mV dec(-1)) and OER (229 mV dec(-1)) were found to be comparable enough to those of Pt/C and Ir/C, respectively. Such lower overpotentials and Tafel slopes arise as a consequence of proliferated electrochemical active surface area; different electronic couplings of molybdenum, copper, and ruthenium; abundant vacancies and defects; homogeneous distribution of copper oxide; higher conductivity of the structure; and unique ultrathin 3d flowerlike morphology.									7	0	0	0	0	0	7				2574-0970		WOS:000692034900012

It is essential to develop bifunctional electrode materials with low cost and high activity. Herein, tremella-like MoS2-AB particles on nickel foam substrate were fabricated through a one-step Solvothermal reaction and exhibited excellent electrocatalytic performance for over-water electrolysis in alkaline media, i.e., overpotentials of 77 and 248 mV to achieve catalytic current density 10 mA cm-2 for hydrogen evolution reaction and oxygen evolution reaction, respectively. Moreover, the two-electrode device demanded 1.51 V cell voltage to reach 10 mA cm-2 and showed good stability of 12 h without iR compensation.

To simulate oxygen generation of single PLPS piece in a confined space, five groups of experimental studies under different temperatures and humidities were performed in a simulator. Under these experimental conditions, temperature and humidity were proportional to the increase rate of oxygen concentration and inversely proportional to the effective time of oxygen generation. A kinetic model of single potassium superoxide was established based on the experimental data and their description by reaction kinetics. The evolution of oxygen was divided into fast and slow reaction stages. The explanation of the behavior of the fast reaction stage is controlled by interfacial reaction and the slow reaction stage by internal diffusion. The suitable ranges of the kinetic model and three application parameters were determined from the oxygen concentration build-up using PLPS pieces.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			1203-8407			WOS:000394869900022

Herein, we have integrated the active components for OER (Ni(OH)_2) and HER (NiS_2 and Ni(OH)_2) into Ni(OH)_2@NiS_2 heterostructures by a facile reflux method. The in-situ formed Ni(OH)_2 thin layer is coated on the surface of hollow NiS_2 nanosphere. The uniform Ni(OH)_2@NiS_2 hollow sphere processes enlarge the electrochemically active specific surface area and enhance the intrinsic activity compared to NiS_2 precursor, which affords a current density of 10 mA cm-2 at the overpotential of 309 mV and 100 mA cm-2 at 359 mV for OER. Meanwhile, Ni(OH)_2@NiS_2 can reach 10 mA cm-2 at 233 mV for HER, superior to pure NiS_2. The enhanced performance can be attributed to the synergy between Ni(OH)_2 and NiS_2. Specifically, Ni(OH)_2 has three functions for water splitting: providing active sites for hydrogen adsorption and hydroxyl group desorption and working as real OER active sites. Moreover, Ni(OH)_2@NiS_2 displays great stability for OER (50 h) and HER (30 h).									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0254-5861			CSCD:7270868

In recent years, this has led to an explosion in reports on electrochemical water splitting, most of them focused on improving the efficiency of the electrochemical reactions themselves. However, efficient generation of hydrogen and oxygen is of little use if these products cannot be kept separate and the community is now coming to realize that there are considerable challenges associated with maintaining adequate separation between H(2)and O(2)during electrolysis driven by intermittent renewable sources. Decoupled electrolysis (whereby oxygen production occurs with reduction of a suitable mediator and hydrogen production is then paired with the reoxidation of this mediator) offers a solution to many of these challenges by allowing O(2)and H(2)to be produced at different times, at different rates, and even in completely different electrochemical cells. In this review, an overview of recent progress in the field of decoupled electrolysis for water splitting is given and the potential that this approach has for enabling a range of other sustainable chemical processes is explored.									52	1	0	0	3	0	53			1614-6832	1614-6840		WOS:000578788700001

We synthesized a nickel-based oxygen evolution catalyst derived from pulse-electrodeposited nickel sulfide. This catalyst was found to produce current densities of 10 mA/cm(2) at the relatively low overpotential of 320 mV in alkaline electrolyte (1 M KOH). Importantly, we found that the sulfur anion in the nickel sulfide is depleted in the active form of the electrocatalyst and that the NiS is converted into an amorphous nickel oxide in the potential range where water is oxidized to oxygen. The superior catalytic activity of this nickel sulfide is thus unrelated to the sulfur anions in the active catalyst but is instead related to the metal sulfide's ability to act as a precursor to a highly active nickel oxide OER electrocatalyst. The nickel oxide derived from nickel sulfide was found to be amorphous with a relatively high surface area, two factors that have been previously shown to be important in oxygen evolution electrocatalysis.									240	9	0	0	7	0	241			2380-8195			WOS:000389617700032

The as-grown Co3O4@CNT, Co3O4@GO, Co3O4@G were investigated for H2O oxidation. The nanoparticles displayed high activity toward oxygen evolution. Further, the stability of the catalysts were tested in alkaline solution, which exhibited good stability. Among all nanoparticles, Co3O4@G exhibited higher current density at lower overpotential and also exhibited lower Tafel slope (157.1 mV dec(-1)) as compared to Co3O4@CNT and Co3O4@GO. The Co3O4@G delivered a current density of 10 mAcm(-2) at 0.8V (overpotential 535 V versus Ag/AgCl) in 0.1 M KOH solution, which is superior than many electrocatalysts reported for oxygen evolution so far. The good electrocatalytic performance might be due to the structural features of Co3O4@G, which cause enhancement of oxygen evolution activity.									15	0	0	0	1	0	15			0272-8842	1873-3956		WOS:000469151800091

Herein, fine Co2P/FeCo nanoparticles (NPs) anchored on Mn, N, P-codoped bamboo-like carbon nanotubes (Co2P/FeCo/MnNP-BCNTs) are constructed in the coexistence of melamine, poly(4-vinylpyridine) and adenosine-5'-diphosphate disodium salt (ADP) by convenient pyrolysis and follow-up acid treatment. The as-prepared catalyst exhibits the higher onset potential (E-onset = 0.97 V vs. RHE) and half-wave potential (E-1/2 = 0.88 V vs. RHE) for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), coupled with excellent oxygen evolution reaction (OER) with the lower overpotential of 324 mV at 10 mA cm(-2). Notably, the home-made Zn-air battery delivers the greater peak power density of 220 mW cm(-2), together with the outstanding cycling stability. The excellent performances of Co2P/FeCo/MnNP-BCNTs catalyst are mainly attributed to the highly conductive carbon nanotubes and the synergistic effects between carbon nanotubes and Co2P/FeCo NPs.

In this study, we report NiCo-LDH ultrathin nanosheets grown on nickel foam as a bifunctional electrocatalyst for overall water splitting. When used as OER and HER electrodes, NiCo-LDH/NF demonstrated excellent water splitting performance, achieving a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at 1.66 V. Thus, the synthesis of hierarchical 3D porous structure composed of 2D ultrathin nanosheets in NiCo-LDH/NF demonstrated the significance of structural features for achieving a high electrocatalytic activity in overall water splitting.									96	8	0	0	3	0	98			1477-9226	1477-9234		WOS:000404860300008	28561853

In the present work we employ density functional theory to examine a variety of two-dimensional materials, including, carbon based materials, hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN), transition metal dichalcogenides (e.g. MoS2, MoSe2) and layered oxides, to give an overview of the trends in adsorption energies. By examining key reaction intermediates relevant to the oxygen reduction, and oxygen evolution reactions we find that binding energies largely follow the linear scaling relationships observed for pure metals. This observation is very important as it suggests that the same simplifying assumptions made to correlate descriptors with reaction rates in transition metal catalysts are also valid for the studied two-dimensional materials. By means of these scaling relations, for each reaction we also identify several promising candidates that are predicted to exhibit a comparable activity to the state-of-the-art catalysts.Scaling relationship for the chemisorption energies of OH* and OOH* on various 2D materials.[GRAPHICS].									40	0	0	0	0	0	40			1011-372X	1572-879X		WOS:000385196700011

This system shows a tunable surface reactivity toward oxygen evolution reaction (OER) through changing the A-site composition (A = Sr2-xCax) and the oxygen vacancy content, delta. We use solid-state synthesis to control the structural ordering and the content of oxygen vacancy. Samples with chemical compositions of x >= 0.75 crystallize in the brownmillerite-type structure, while those with low calcium content (x < 0.75) crystallize in either perovskite or brownmillerite structure. Our electrochemical analysis shows that compounds with mixed A-site compositions outperform Ca2Fe2O6-delta and Sr2Fe2O6-delta and reveal several compounds with higher activity than LaCoO3-delta (measured at 2 mA cm(-2)). The oxygen vacancy content (delta) of the compounds was quantified using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. The delta vs A-site composition trend shows a transition point where the structural transition was also observed, i.e., x similar or equal to 0.75. Interestingly, electrochemical activity correlates with delta, and compounds with delta -> 1 tend to show higher activity. Our results show how short-range and long-range structural ordering and oxygen vacancy content can be employed to tune catalytic properties of Fe-based perovskites.									10	0	0	0	1	0	10			2574-0962			WOS:000487770000003

Different from previous design strategies based on single parameter, here the necessary and sufficient conditions are proposed to develop bulk non-noble metal oxides which are generally considered inactive toward HER in alkaline solutions: i) multiple active sites for different reaction intermediates and ii) a short reaction path created by ordered distribution and appropriate numbers of these active sites. Computational studies predict that a synergistic interplay between the ordered oxygen vacancies (at pyramidal high-spin Co3+ sites) and the O 2p ligand holes (OLH; at metallic octahedral intermediate-spin Co4+ sites) in RBaCo2O5.5+ ( = 1/4; R = lanthanides) can produce a near-ideal HER reaction path to adsorb H2O and release H-2, respectively. Experimentally, the as-synthesized (Gd0.5La0.5)BaCo2O5.75 outperforms the state-of-the-art Pt/C catalyst in many aspects. The proof-of-concept results reveal that the simultaneous possession of ordered oxygen vacancies and an appropriate number of OLH can realize a near-optimal synergistic catalytic effect, which is pivotal for rational design of oxygen-containing materials.									65	2	0	0	8	0	65			1616-301X	1616-3028		WOS:000471335500019

In lieu of this, we evaluated heterostructured copper selenide and zinc selenide enwrapped in carbon nanofibers (CZSe@C-450) as bifunctional electrocatalysts synthesized by electrospinning and selenization. CZSe@C-450 demonstrated superior electrochemical performance with a low overpotential of 260 mV at 10 mA cm(-2), high stability (1.2% loss in 12 hours and 9.9% loss in 50 hours) for oxygen evolution reaction, a half-wave potential (E-1/2) of 0.88 V, and high stability (14.35% loss in 50 hours) for oxygen reduction reaction. The enhanced performance is attributed to the formation of a heterogeneous phase boundary between copper selenide and zinc selenide, which increases both the built-in potential and local atomic disorder. The lattice mismatch/disorder reduces the surface energy and leads to the creation of an ample number of active sites that participate in both oxygen evolution and reduction reactions.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2044-4753	2044-4761		WOS:000831314100001

Despite its lower cost, palladium (Pd) has attracted much less attention due to relatively lower activity and stability than Pt. Great efforts have been focusing on developing more active and stable Pd-based electrocatalyts aiming to partially or completely replace costly Pt for the past decade. This paper overviews the recent advances in Pd-based electrocatalysts for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), and fuel cell reactions including hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR), oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), ethanol oxidation reaction (EOR) and formic acid oxidation reaction (FAOR).

Herein, we reported a Ni-Co phosphide @phosphate nanocages (NCPP NCs) catalyst prepared by phosphorization of Ni-Co layered double hydroxide (Ni-Co LDH) with in-situ formation of phosphate. The NCPP NCs exhibited an improved wettability with a contact angle of approximately 0 degrees compared with those of Ni-Co LDH (52 degrees) and nickel-cobalt phosphides (NiCoP) (99 degrees). NCPP NCs have been used for enhancing the water-splitting efficiency, and it only required the overpotentials of 291 mV and 140 mV for OER and HER in 0.1 M KOH to achieve the current densities of 10 mA cm(-2), respectively. Impressively, the overpotential of NCPP NCs decreased by 42 mV and 64 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) for OER in comparison with those of Ru0 2 and NiCoP (without phosphate phase). Consequently, NCPP NCs, as the bifunctional catalysts, displayed an outstanding performance for the whole water-splitting process with a small potential of 1.60 V at 10 mA cm(-2) and long-term stability. These performances enabled this material to be a promising catalyst for overall water electrolysis. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

Journal of colloid and interface science				629	Pt B			896	907		10.1016/j.jcis.2022.09.125				2022-Sep-28	2022	Exploring high-efficiency electrocatalysts for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is one of the most important concerns to produce hydrogen in water electrolysis. Herein, the FNM/Co2P-0.4 heterostructure was designed as an electrocatalyst for the OER process by the combination of MoO42- intercalating NiFe LDH and Co2P on nickel foam (NF). The surface reconstruction and MoO42- leaching can induce the conversion of Co2P and NiFe LDH on FNM/Co2P-0.4 to generate Co/NiOOH with more oxygen vacancies. Beyond, CoOOH and NiOOH can also synergize to reduce the energy barrier of OER, optimize conductivity, and improve stability. The surface reconstruction and the formation of OOH⁎ were further unveiled by in-situ UV-vis absorption spectra and Fourier-transformed alternative current voltammetry (FTACV). The integration of interfacial synergies and oxygen vacancies can facilitate the adsorption/desorption of intermediates, regulate the d-band center, and expose more active sites. And as a result, FNM/Co2P-0.4 shows a significant low overpotential (240mV) at 50mAcm-2, a small Tafel (74mV dec-1), low activation energy (Ea) and remarkable durability. This work provides a new pathway to improve the OER performance by using interfacial synergies and rich oxygen vacancies derived from the self-sacrificial reconstruction of heterostructured electrocatalysts.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0				1095-7103		MEDLINE:36206678	36206678

Here we introduce Ag into Sm0.5Sr0.5CoO3-delta (SSC) to form a Ag-SSC catalyst by ultrasonication and apply it as the air electrode for a Zn-air battery. It finds that the introduction of Ag into SSC can transform the Ag-SSC into a good bifunctional electrocatalyst toward ORR as well as OER. For instance, a more active half-wave potential with a value of 0.76 V for ORR is obtained at 1,600 rpm, while the OER overpotential is 0.43 V at I = 10 mA cm(-2). Further characterization demonstrates that the improved catalyst activity of the Ag-SSC can be assigned to the synergistic effect generated between the Ag and SSC phases. The Zn-air battery with the Ag-SSC as an electrode not only gives a same discharge-charge voltage gap (1.33 V) with that of commercial Pt/C (1.33 V) but also presents an equivalent current efficiency (45.7% for Ag-SSC and 45.3% for Pt/C) at 10 mA cm(-2). Moreover, the stability for 110 cycles is better. This result indicates that the Ag-SSC catalyst shows promise for use as a bifunctional electrocatalyst toward OER and ORR.									20	1	0	0	0	0	20			2296-2646			WOS:000476785400001	31396508

Catalysts for electrocatalytic reactions, including hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), oxygen evolution reaction (OER), oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR), carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CO2RR), play a significant role in the advanced energy conversion technologies, such as water splitting devices, fuel cells, and rechargeable metal-air batteries. Developing low-cost and highly efficient electrocatalysts is closely related to establishing the composition-structure-activity relationships and fundamental understanding of catalytic mechanisms. Density functional theory (DFT) is emerging as an important computational tool that can provide insights into the relationship between the electrochemical performances and physical/chemical properties of catalysts. This article presents a review on the progress of the DFT, and the computational simulations, within the framework of DFT, for the electrocatalytic processes, as well as the computational designs and virtual screenings of new electrocatalysts. Some useful descriptors and analysis tools for evaluating the electrocatalytic performances are highlighted, including formation energies, d-band model, scaling relation, e(g) orbital occupation, and free energies of adsorption. Furthermore, the remaining questions and perspectives for the development of DFT for electrocatalysis are also proposed.									20	0	0	0	0	0	20				2575-0356		WOS:000690669600001

However, further improvement of their catalytic activity is challenging due to their low conductivity and the similarity among the electronic structures of neighboring 3d metal modulators. Herein, FeCo-(oxy)hydroxide nanosheet arrays containing Mo grown directly on Fe foam (FF) are synthesized by a cost-effective and energy-efficient corrosion engineering method, which is realized via the controlled oxygen corrosion reaction of FF. Furthermore, the introduction of high-valence Mo can efficiently regulate the electronic coordination environment, and the control of the corrosion time can fabricate amorphous-crystalline heterostructures. Therefore, the as-prepared catalyst exhibits superior catalytic performance with an ultralow overpotential of 212 mV to reach a current density of 100 mA cm(-2). The results show that the corrosion engineering method and introduction of high-valence metal modulators are favorable directions for the development of high-activity and cost-effective electrocatalysts. Interestingly, this method is universal and can be easily extended to other metal oxide composites.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			2168-0485			WOS:000696378200020

Here we report the facile synthesis of a novel bifunctional catalyst, mesoporous Co3O4 with surface decorated epitaxial S-doped CoO layers (S-CoO/Co3O4), via a simple solution-combustion and thioacetamide-sulfidation method. S-CoO/Co3O4 shows excellent electrochemical catalytic activity and stability in 1 M KOH with small overpotentials of 275 mV for OER and 181 mV for HER at 10 mA cm(-2) on a rotating disk electrode. Moreover, when loaded on nickel foam and used as both cathode and anode for overall water splitting, the current density reaches 10 mA cm(-2) at a relatively low voltage of 1.60 V and degrades for only similar to 5.7% after 20 h operation. The excellent electrochemical performance is mainly attributed to the highly active surface S-doped CoO species, which also acts as the protective buffer layer for the inner bulk phase and results in enhanced stability. Density functional theory calculations show that the S-doping in CoO and Co3O4 can accelerate the carrier transport, promoting the overall electronic conductivity and electrochemical catalytic activity.									31	2	0	0	3	0	31			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000522640100012

Unfortunately, because of an apparent coupling between their key binding intermediates, the two reactions can easily occur simultaneously, which is never an attractive outcome. In this work, using a series of iridium-based double perovskites and rotating ring-disk voltammetry to deconvolute parallel OER and CER currents, we explored the interdependence of CER and OER in dilute acidic chloride solutions of up to 120 mM, where both reactions may occur in parallel with similar current densities. We also employed online inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) measurements to probe the material stability and its dependence on chloride concentration. For all studied materials, we found a strong linear correlation between CER and OER activity as well as a comparable selectivity, strengthening the suggestion that OER and CER follow a scaling relationship. It was also found that chloride selectively enhances the dissolution of the noble metal component. A reaction order analysis was performed to gain insight into the CER mechanism, the effect of surface area changes due to adventitious leaching, and the observed suppressing effect of chloride on OER.									48	1	0	0	5	0	49			2155-5435			WOS:000485090400095		
J	Liu, Taifeng; Zhang, Qingyan; Zhao, Qianyu								Theoretical insight into the anion vacancy healing process during the oxygen evolution reaction on TaON and Ta3N5								PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY CHEMICAL PHYSICS				24	22			13999	14006		10.1039/d2cp01615j		MAY 2022		JUN 8 2022	2022	Anion vacancies are common defects in materials, and they are usually much more stable on the outermost surface. These vacancies are sometimes taken as active sites in some reactions during catalysis. During the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), these vacancies may be healed by oxygen atoms from water. But this healing process is not well understood yet. In this work, we investigated the details of the anion vacancy healing process in the OER using TaON and Ta3N5 as models. In the OER process, we found that the vacancies are stable and cannot be healed without an applied potential. But with the equilibrium potential of 1.23 V, the vacancies on the outermost top surface will be healed. The oxygen vacancies, after healing, revert back to a clean surface. The nitrogen vacancies become an oxygen doped surface after vacancy healing. We also investigated the vacancy healing process on other well-known photocatalysts, like TiO2, BiVO4, WO3, alpha-Fe2O3, NaTaO3 and SrTiO3, and we found that the vacancies on the top surface of these materials will also be healed in the OER with an applied equilibrium potential of 1.23 V. The results presented here could expand to other materials used for the OER in (photo) electro-catalysis and photocatalysis. This work provides a new insight for understanding the role of vacancies in the OER.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1463-9076	1463-9084		WOS:000802836900001	35635533

Herein, the enhancement in the electrocatalytic water splitting and nonenzymatic glucose sensing in alkaline media was realized from the synergistic effect of porous Ni/Co hydr(oxy)oxide structures grown on nickel foam via a facile bubble-templated electrodeposition approach followed by catalytic activation. The effect is likely due to synergy between the low overpotential of nickel and higher adsorption of hydrogen for cobalt in combination with enhanced surface area, where better diffusion of electrolyte in the interconnected pores and low charge-transfer resistance is best realized with the Ni/Co = 1:1 electrode. The overpotential for catalytic current density of 20 mA cm(-2) is 132 mV for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and 338 mV for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) with the corresponding Tafel slopes of 55.3 and 66.1 mV dec(-1), respectively. In a two-electrode configuration, the same Ni/Co = 1:1 electrodes allow the current density of 10 mA cm(-2) to be achieved at a stable cell potential of 1.71 V. Moreover, the same electrode shows an excellent glucose sensitivity of 6.6 mA mM(-1) cm(-2) with minimal interference from uric and ascorbic acids.									18	1	0	0	2	0	18			2168-0485			WOS:000474474800030

However, the OER suffers from sluggish kinetics and high overpotential due to its complex 4-electron/proton transfer mechanism. Thus, developing efficient electrocatalysts is particularly urgent to accelerate OER catalysis but still remains a great challenge. Herein, we have synthesized the novel cobalt molybdate nanoflakes (CoMoO4-O-v-n@GF) with adjustable oxygen vacancies contents by in situ constructing CoMoO4 nanoflakes on graphite felt (GF) and annealing treatment under the reduction atmosphere. The best-performing CoMoO4-O-v-2@GF with optimal oxygen vacancies content shows splendid electrocatalytic performance with the low overpotential (296 mV at 10 mA cm(-2)) and also small Tafel slope (62.4 mV dec(-1)) in alkaline solution, which are comparable to those of the RuO2@GF. The experimental and the density functional theory calculations results reveal that the construction of optimal oxygen vacancies in CoMoO4 can expose more active sites, narrow the band-gap to increase the electrical conductivity, and modulate the free energy of the OER-related intermediates to accelerate OER kinetics, thus improving its intrinsic activity.

However, the nature of active sites of SACs under realistic reaction conditions is ambiguous. In this work, high loading Pt single atoms on graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4)-derived N-doped carbon nanosheets (Pt-1/NCNS) is achieved through atomic layer deposition. Operando X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) is performed on Pt single atoms and nanoparticles (NPs) in both the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). The operando results indicate that the total unoccupied density of states of Pt 5d orbitals of Pt-1 atoms is higher than that of Pt NPs under HER condition, and that a stable Pt oxide is formed during ORR on Pt-1/NCNS, which may suppress the adsorption and activation of O-2. This work unveils the nature of Pt single atoms under realistic HER and ORR conditions, providing a deeper understanding for designing advanced SACs.									33	3	0	0	7	0	34			1613-6810	1613-6829		WOS:000619446600001	33605070

Herein, cobalt phosphide/N-doped carbon (CoP/NC) was synthesized by an extremely convenient approach. Compared with pure CoP, NC wrapped around CoP nanoparticles, which prevented the agglomeration and improved electron transfer of CoP. The obtained CoP/NC exhibited better activity than pure CoP, which has a low overpotential (eta(10)=139/248 mV) and a small Tafel slope (59/82 mV dec(-1)) in 0.5 M H2SO4 and 1 M KOH for the HER. CoP/NC exhibited excellent stability with no obvious change in activity for the HER after 5000 cycles. CoP/NC also had high ORR activity, which gave a more positive half-potential (0.85 V) and onset potential (0.9 V) than pure CoP at 1600 rpm in 0.1 M KOH.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1452-3981			WOS:000813979300028

These processes involve complicated bond breaking and formation at the surfaces as well as charge transfer through interfaces which are challenging to track under operational conditions. We address the nature of these interfacial processes using ambient pressure X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy by leveraging both its chemical and surface sensitivity. Herein, we give several examples of fuel cell and electrolysis reactions to demonstrate the importance of probing the surface under operating conditions. Oxygen reduction reaction taking place on the platinum cathode in proton exchange membrane fuel cells, water splitting reactions including oxygen evolution reaction over IrO2 and hydrogen evolution reaction over MoSx reveal that different species dominate on the surface under different operational conditions and surface activities are directly related to the stabilities of those intermediate species and possible structural rearrangements of the catalyst material.									18	0	0	0	1	0	18			1022-5528	1572-9028		WOS:000371424800004

The CoOOH/Cu/Ni foam durability test shows almost no decay after 1000 cycles. The cell using the CoOOH/Cu/Ni foam for water electrolysis demonstrates a very stable current density of about 110 mA cm(-2) at the cell potential of 1.8 V during 100 h of operation. The operando XAS analysis is carried out to understand the OER mechanism of the CoOOH/ Cu/Ni foam. The hydrangea-like and amorphous CoOOH of the CoOOH/Cu/Ni foam shows the potentialdependent deprotonation reaction during the OER, forming a highly active phase. The thin-layer Cu of the CoOOH/Cu/Ni foam increases the conductivity and adsorbs oxygen intermediates after the initial reaction at onset potential to positively affect the OER.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			2168-0485			WOS:000696378200026

Here, we utilized copper (Cu) weaving mesh to in situ fabricate earth abundant elements-based integrated electrodes for high performance water splitting, where NiFe layered double hydroxide (NiFe-LDH) ultrathin nanoarrys for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and Cu3P nanowires for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) were successfully constructed on the Cu mesh. Notably, large stable current densities are obtained for both OER (600 mA cm(-2)) and HER (200 mA cm(-2)) electrodes under low overpotential, which is superior to most of the nanoparticle-based electrodes. The large current density is mainly because of the excellent conductivity and clean surface (binder free) of the Cu mesh-based electrode, and which is extremely important for industrial application. The prepared integrated electrodes are coupled with a macroscopic porous sieve and microscopic nanostructures. The assembled NiFe-LDH vertical bar vertical bar Cu3P electrolyzer exhibits a small cell working voltage of 1.72 V under the current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at room temperature, as well as long-term stabilities (>10 h) in 1 M KOH. These excellent performances of our earth-abundant elements-based weaving mesh electrode result from their improved charge transfer, surface area, mass transport, and faster kinetics of catalytic reactions.									66	1	0	0	2	0	66			2168-0485			WOS:000419536800041

In this work, the feasibility of stabilizing FeNC catalysts with small quantities of Ir was explored. With iridium being present, instead of COR the oxygen evolution reaction should be favored. The impact on structure and morphology was investigated by Fe-57 Mossbauer spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy and transmission electron microscopy. The catalytic activity and durability for the oxygen reduction reaction was evaluated by rotating ring disc electrode experiments and accelerated stress tests mimicking the start-up and shutdown cycle (SSC) conditions, respectively. For selected samples the stability was analysed for SSCs in proton exchange membrane fuel cells. Moreover, the faradaic efficiency towards oxygen evolution reaction vs. COR was determined and the resistance towards COR analysed by in situ Raman spectroscopy. The results indicate indeed a suppression of the COR; however, specifically for fuel cell applications, further optimization is necessary.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000712540200001

An optimized synthesis of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalysts may lead to a cost efficient production, promoting the commercialization of new catalyst materials. This work compares the electrochemical characteristics of Ir nanoparticles synthetized in different purities of ethanol and deionized (DI) water as solvents. The use of cetyltrimethyl ammonium bromide (CTAB) as a surfactant is discussed as well. In general, the absence of the surfactant and use of either low ethanol purity or water is detrimental for electrocatalytic properties of the materials. Changes in the Tafel slope are observed, while the analysis of the specific exchange current can be misleading. The active sites from the IrIII/IrIV oxidation peak do not correlate exactly with the OER activities, while the capacitive current provides more meaningful information.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			1938-5862			INSPEC:16872419

The research has been performed on devices having an Ir concentration between 20 and 90 mol% of noblemetal, at different temperatures (in the range from 2 to 60 degrees C) and at four different [H+] concentrations (between 1.0 and 10(-3) moll(-1)). Approximately constant activation energies have been obtained, with values close to 12.4 kcal mol(-1); moreover, the electrode composition proved not to affect the reaction pathway in a significant manner. At all devices, the OER appears to take place with one and the same mechanism, as suggested by the relative constancy of Tafel slopes and reaction orders with respect to H+. The mechanistic path has been confirmed also on the basis of the reaction order with respect to the active site. The effective catalytic activity of the mixed-oxide coating is not influenced by the noble-metal content. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Herein, iron phosphate (Fe-7(PO4)(6)) was prepared via microwave radiation using ionic liquid (IL) as iron and phosphorus dual-source. This method is simple and rapid, and the product can be directly used as electrocatalysts without further treatment. The experimental results show that the IL can influence the morphology and electrocatalytic performance. Moreover, the addition of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) is favorable for formation of iron phosphate nanoparticles to improve the catalytic activities. As hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) catalyst, this iron phosphate/CNTs exhibits an onset overpotential of 120 mV, Tafel slope of 32.9 mV dec(-1), and current densities of 10 mA cm(-2) at overpotential of 185 mV. Then, it obtains a good activity for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) with a low onset potential of 1.48 V, Tafel slope of 73.3 mV dec(-1), and it only needs an overpotential of 300 mV to drive the 10 mA cm(-2). This bifunctional catalyst also shows good durability for HER and OER. This microwave-assisted method provides an outstanding strategy to prepare iron phosphate in a simple and fast process with good catalytic performance for water splitting. (C) 2021 The Author(s).

In this study, a new catalyst Ni2P/Mn2O3 nanofibers with the advantages of ultra-high electrochemical active area were successfully synthesized. We explored effective strategies that are constructing one-dimensional nanostructures and composite oxides to promote the electrocatalytic performance of transition metal phosphides. The Ni2P/Mn2O3 nanofibers only require a low over-potential of 280 mV to deliver a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) in 1 M KOH for oxygen production. As a result, it is worthily mentioned that the activity of Ni2P/Mn2O3 nanofibers is virtually unchanged after 2000 cycles of voltammetry measurements with a stable nanostructure. This research provides a feasible solution for the design and realization of nanostructured electrocatalysts for the enhancing performance of the OER process. (C) 2022 Elsevier Inc.

Especially, unlocking the catalytic site, in turn, helps design the available catalysts. Herein, the nanorod cobalt telluride with sulfur incorporation grown on a carbon cloth (S-CoTe/CC) as catalysts for OER, which displays extraordinary catalytic activity, is reported. Significantly, the in situ formed CoOOH species on the surface of S-CoTe merited from the structure evolution during the OER process serves as the active species. Furthermore, density functional theory calculations demonstrate that sulfur incorporation can tailor the electronic structure of active species and substantially optimize the free energy, accelerating the OER kinetics. This work provides an in-depth understanding of enhanced OER mechanism through foreign elements incorporating into precatalysts and is beneficial for the guiding design of more efficient catalysts.									20	0	0	0	0	0	19			1613-6810	1613-6829		WOS:000668589400001	34197035

However, they are seldom investigated for overall water splitting. Additionally, it is a significant challenge to increase the heteroatom content in carbon and achieve performance comparable or superior to precious metal-based catalysts. Here, NiFe-decorated, nitrogen, phosphorus, sulfur tri-doped nanocarbon with oxygen-containing groups, i.e., NiFe-N, P, S/C is reported as a highly-active electrocatalyst for overall water splitting. The carbons are prepared by one-step template-free pyrolysis. Alfalfa, one of the natural biomass with highest N: C ratio and significant P and S, works as the sole carbon and heteroatom source. During preparation, crucial factors including total amount of added transition metals, Ni to Fe molar ratio, and pyrolysis temperature, are optimized. Ni0.75Fe0.25-N, P, S/C prepared at 900 degrees C exhibits the best oxygen evolution reaction, hydrogen evolution reaction, and overall water splitting activity and stability. This material even exceeds the benchmark RuO2 in catalysing oxygen evolution reaction. Its overall water splitting activity is comparable to Pt/C-RuO2, making it one of the best water splitting electrocatalysts. This exciting performance is attributed to the high heteroatom level ((N + P + S + 0): C = 27.6 at.%), as well as the bimetal decoration.									31	1	0	0	1	0	32			0378-7753	1873-2755		WOS:000449444500036

In this work, we have synthesized Iridium nanorods (Ir-NR/C) by annealing Ir nanoparticles at 300 degrees C requiring comparatively low overpotentials of 290 mV, 296 mV and 305 mV to achieve current density of 10 mA cm(-2) for OER catalysis in 0.5 M H2SO4 , 1 M KOH and 1 M PBS with a low Ir loading of 14 mu g cm(-2), respectively, resulting in similar to 30 times higher mass activity compared to commercial IrO2. Moreover, stable OER performance is recorded due to the formed thin amorphous Iridium oxides (IrOx) layer protecting the underneath metallic Ir from direct electrochemical dissolution and coalescences. Besides, IrOx layer negligibly affects the HER performance in acidic medium; but promotes the HER catalytic activities in alkaline and neutral electrolytes since the Volmer step (water dissociation) is efficiently catalyzed by IrOx layer enabling a 6-fold better mass activity than benchmarked PVC. Ir-NR/C performs superior stability during HER catalysis in a wide pH range ascribed the prevention of Ir migration and aggregation. Finally, the assembled water splitting device by Ir-NR/C shows robust activity and exceptional stability than benchmarked PVC-IrO2 in pH-universal electrolytes.									36	0	0	0	1	0	36			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000566452900009

Metalacetylacetonates were used as precursors and oxygen as the reactant gas. Appropriate deposition conditions for obtaining bi-metallic oxide films were found to be deposition temperature (T-dep), 673 K and total pressure (P-tot), 133.32 Pa. X-Ray diffraction (XRD), Rielveld refinement and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) results demonstrated that the MOCVD method is a viable alternative to grow RuxIr1-xO2 films consisted of a single-phase with a very homogeneous distribution of elements. The electrocatalytic activity of the RuxIr1-xO2 films was investigated by' cyclic voltammetry and anodic polarization curves in a 0.5 M H2SO4 solution at room temperature. The single-phase Ru0.4Ir0.6O2 films showed to be very promising for the oxygen evolution reaction due to a synergistic effect.

We approach this problem by applying structure-property analysis to a series of hematite samples synthesized under either O-2 or N-2 environments such that they exhibit highly variable performance for photoelectrocatalytic oxygen evolution. X-ray absorption fine-structure spectroscopy and Raman spectroscopy provide parameters describing the structure of samples across the series. Systematic comparisons of these parameters to those describing photoelectrochemical performance reveal different defects in samples prepared under N-2 or O-2. Distinct correlations between both the iron oxidation state and charge carrier density with photoelectrocatalytic performance lead to assignment of the primary defects as oxygen vacancies (N-2) and iron vacancies (O-2). Differences in the structural distortions caused by these defects are seen in correlations between short-range structural parameters and photoelectrochemical behavior. These distortions are readily observed by Raman spectroscopy, suggesting that it may be possible to calibrate the width, energy, and intensity of peaks in Raman spectra to enable direct analysis of defects in hematite photoanodes.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000758000600001	35099916

Although tetragonal phase (t-phase) in the multiple crystallographic structures of HfO2 outperforms monoclinic phase (m-phase) most common phase that can be formed at low temperature in physicochemical properties such as dielectric constant, bandgap, high resistance to corrosion and hardness, it is extremely hard to stabilize t-phase below 1670 degrees C. Herein, we synthesized oxygen-deficient tetragonal hafnium oxide nanofibers (t-HfO2-x NFs) using the electrospinning technique, which included the polymer-blended precursors and a magnesium-thermic reaction at a low processing temperature (< 600 degrees C). The small grain size (< 10 nm) of the t-HfO2-x NFs and oxygen vacancies (V-oxygen) synergistically stabilized t-phase in the nanofibrous structure. Oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) performances of the t-HfO2-x NFs in alkaline and acid media were evaluated as a potential application, which were higher than those of the m-HfO2 NFs. Our straightforward approach to make t-phase in HfO2-based materials can be broadly applied for many future applications.									7	0	0	0	0	0	7			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000580616900058

However, both perovskites and spinels show unsatisfactory performance even at the optimal spin states. In comparison, some oxides with a rock salt structure (e.g., (NiCoO2)-Co-II-O-II) exhibit higher activity than perovskites and spinels, nevertheless, the rock salt structure excludes valence changes of the transition metals, obstructing further e(g) optimization and performance enhancement. Herein, an innovative strategy is demonstrated to regulate the spin states of Co-II in NiCoO2 via crystallinity manipulation, thus providing a new strategy for e(g) optimization. Remarkably, the catalyst (CNO-8) with a moderate e(g) occupancy (approximate to 1.2) achieves the best electrocatalytic activity, which is among the highest achieved by the state-of-the-art electrocatalysts, namely, an overpotential of approximate to 269 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) for oxygen evolution reaction and an onset potential of 935 mV for oxygen reduction reaction. As an efficient bifunctional catalyst for rechargeable Zn-air batteries, CNO-8 even outperforms the noble metal catalyst (Pt/C + RuO2), demonstrating high potential for practical applications in electrochemical energy conversion.									30	1	0	0	0	0	30			1614-6832	1614-6840		WOS:000440805400001

No significant difference in the oxygen evolution efficiency between in magnetoelectrolysis at 5T and in no magnetic field is observed for an electrolysis time of 30 sec. When magnetoelectrolysis at 5T is carried out for 90 sec the oxygen evolution efficiency became higher by about 5% than that at 0T. The imposed magnetic field seems to have an effect of increasing the oxygen evolution efficiency, cancelling out the effect of the decrease in pH of the anolyte during electrolysis.

Recently, an advanced material-screening approach, entitled ESSI-descriptor activity maps, has been introduced by the author. This methodology goes beyond the thermodynamic framework of Volcano plots, as the concept of ESSI-descriptor activity maps evaluates, besides binding energies, the kinetics, applied overpotential, and catalytic symmetry in terms of the electrochemical-step symmetry index (ESSI). Herein, the concept of ESSI-descriptor activity maps is exerted to the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) to derive universal relationships. In contrast to the common procedure in the literature, a suitable range of values for the linear scaling relation's offset is a priori included in the presented model, which enables high-throughput screening of OER catalysts and determination of the rate-determining reaction step (rds) at overpotentials corresponding to typical reaction conditions (eta(OER)=0.40 V).									13	0	0	0	1	0	13			1867-3880	1867-3899		WOS:000515397200001

Electrochemical technology can achieve high-efficiency, low-cost clean energy conversion, mainly relying on highly efficient electrocatalysts, including noble metals such as Au, Pt, Pd. MXenes, an emerging class of two-dimensional materials, have been widely used in electrocatalysis due to their high conductivity, large specific surface area, and good hydrophilicity. In particular, MXenes and their derivatives have been widely used to support various noble metal nanomaterials. They have shown outstanding catalytic performances and good stability in the hydrogen evolution reaction, oxygen evolution reaction, oxygen reduction reaction, nitrogen reduction reaction, and methanol oxidation reaction. Herein, we review the strategies for the synthesis of noble metal MXene-based catalysts, emphasize the application of noble metal MXene-based catalysts in the field of electrocatalysis, and focus on the strategy of enhancing the electrocatalytic performance of noble metal MXene-based catalysts. Based on this, the limitations and future development of noble metal MXene-based catalysts in electrocatalysis are discussed.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000811626300001

It offers a low cost, light weight cathode that minimizes the loss in specific energy of lithium-oxygen batteries as well. To date, however, carbon dioxide evolution has been an unavoidable event during the operation of non-aqueous lithium-oxygen batteries with carbon electrodes, due to the reactivity of carbon against self-decomposition and catalytic decomposition of electrolyte. Here we report a simple but potent approach to eliminate carbon dioxide evolution by using an ionic solvate of dimethoxyethane and lithium nitrate. We show that the solvate leads to deactivation of the carbon electrode against parasitic reactions by electrochemical doping of nitrogen into carbon. This work demonstrates that one could take full advantage of carbon by mitigating the undesired activity.									72	2	0	0	6	0	73			2041-1723			WOS:000337505200002	24849589

Series of ultrathin metallic nickel-based holey nitride nanosheets were designed as bifunctional catalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). They exhibit improved catalytic properties owing to the inherent advantages of their plentiful active reaction sites resulting from the complete exposure of the atoms in the large lateral surfaces and from the edges of pore areas, together with expanded lattice spacing distance. This obtained three-dimensional conductive integral architecture can not only accelerate the electron transportation by the highly orientated crystalline structure but also facilitate the diffusion of intermediate and gases. In terms of the OER electrocatalytic properties, a quite low overpotential (300 mV) is required for the holey two-dimensional (2D) Ni3Fe nitride nanosheets to deliver a current density of about 100 A g(-1) with an enhanced improvement over IrO2 by a factor of nearly 25 times. The holey 2D Ni3Fe nitride nanosheets also exhibit enhanced catalytic performance toward the HER, with a tiny overpotential (233 mV) to achieve a current density of about 100 A g(-1) with much better kinetic properties in comparison to those of highly active Pt/C.									56	3	0	0	3	0	56			2155-5435			WOS:000447224100078

Herein, an efficient catalyst was prepared via in situ immobilizing Co and MnO hetero-nanoparticles onto N-doped hierarchical activated carbon (abbreviated as Co@C,MnO-NAC) using broussonetia papyrifera as the carbon source. The different redox properties of Co and Mn induced the selective wrapping of carbon shells on nanoparticles. The Co@C,MnO-NAC composite via selective wrapping possesses relatively independent oxygen reduction reaction (ORR)/oxygen evolution reaction (OER) active centers and displays outstanding electrocatalytic activity for the synergistic effect between MnO, Co@C and NAC. It presents excellent ORR and OER catalytic performance with a small overpotential gap (E-OER - E-ORR = 0.72 V). An aqueous zinc-air battery based on Co@C,MnO-NAC exhibits an open-circuit voltage of 1.46 V and long-term stability of 110 cycles. This work provides a selective wrapping strategy for designing efficient metallic compound-activated carbon-based electrocatalysts to apply in energy conversion facilities.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2398-4902			WOS:000741035800001

Herein, we report a simple method for the synthesis of graphene-reinforced CoS/C nanocomposites and the evaluation of their electrocatalytic performance for typical electrocatalytic reactions. Nanocomposites of CoS embedded in N, S co-doped porous carbon and graphene (CoS@C/Graphene) were generated via simultaneous sulfurization and carbonization of one-pot synthesized graphite oxide-ZIF-67 precursors. The obtained CoS@C/Graphene nanocomposites were characterized by X-ray diffraction, Raman spectroscopy, thermogravimetric analysis-mass spectroscopy, scanning electronic microscopy, transmission electronic microscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and gas sorption. It is found that CoS nanoparticles homogenously dispersed in the in situ formed N, S co-doped porous carbon/graphene matrix. The CoS@C/10Graphene composite not only shows excellent electrocatalytic activity toward ORR with high onset potential of 0.89 V, four-electron pathway and superior durability of maintaining 98% of current after continuously running for around 5 h, but also exhibits good performance for OER and HER, due to the improved electrical conductivity, increased catalytic active sites and connectivity between the electrocatalytic active CoS and the carbon matrix. This work offers a new approach for the development of novel multifunctional nanocomposites for the next generation of energy conversion and storage applications.									7	0	0	0	0	0	7			2095-0179	2095-0187		WOS:000702622100002		
J	Wang, Haizhen; Zhou, Meng; Choudhury, Pabitra; Luo, Hongmei								Perovskite oxides as bifunctional oxygen electrocatalysts for oxygen evolution/reduction reactions - A mini review								APPLIED MATERIALS TODAY				16				56	71		10.1016/j.apmt.2019.05.004				SEP 2019	2019	Energy crisis due to the depletion of fossil fuel as well as the increased population has stimulated researchers to search for new energy resources and energy storage and conversion systems, including fuel cells, electrolyzers and metal-air batteries. Oxygen evolution reaction ( OER) and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) are two reactions that dominate the overall performance of these devices. However, the sluggish kinetics of these two reactions still impedes the practical application of these devices. Therefore, electrocatalysts, especially non-noble metal oxides are needed to expedite the reactions. Perovskite oxides, as a member of the mixed metal oxide family, show promising electrocatalytic performance toward both ORR and OER. However, there are only a few articles regarding the recent progress of perovskites as bifunctional electrocatalysts till now. In this mini-review, we summarize the recent research status and progress of perovskite oxides as electrocatalysts for ORR/OER, including the basic mechanism behind the catalytic reactions, different approaches to synthesize perovskites as well as the various strategies that researchers have developed to promote their electrocatalytic activities. Besides, the related theoretical calculation method, density functional theory (DFT), which is used to understand the mechanism behind these reactions, has also been discussed. It is believed that this mini-review can not only offer researchers guidance to synthesize perovskite oxides as demanded, but also provide researchers more insights into how to rationally design new perovskite-based catalysts with improved bifunctional electrocatalytic properties.

However, because of the multi-electron transfer in the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) process, the kinetics of the reaction is seriously hindered. To address this issue, we designed and synthesized hollow CoP/FeP4 heterostructural nanorods interwoven by carbon nanotubes (CoP/FeP4@CNT) via a hydrothermal reaction and a phosphorization process. The CoP/FeP4@CNT hybrid catalyst delivers prominent OER electrochemical performances: it displays a substantially smaller Tafel slope of 48.0 mV dec(-1) and a lower overpotential of 301 mV at 10 mA cm(-2), compared with an RuO2 commercial catalyst; it also shows good stability over 20 h. The outstanding OER property is mainly attributed to the synergistic coupling between its unique CNT-interwoven hollow nanorod structure and the CoP/FeP4 heterojunction, which can not only guarantee high conductivity and rich active sites, but also greatly facilitate the electron transfer, ion diffusion, and O-2 gas release and significantly enhance its electrocatalytic activity. This work offers a facile method to develop transition metal-based phosphide heterostructure electrocatalysts with a unique hierarchical nanostructure for high performance water oxidation.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4				2079-4991		WOS:000666203100001	34070770

However, the concomitant oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is unavoidable by using the noble metal-based dimensionally stable anodes (DSAs) as CER benchmark catalysts. Through purposely screening six TMN4 complexes embedded graphene with the demonstrated low performance of OER, our density functional theory (DFT) results predict that NiN4 complex embedded graphene (NiN4@G) can efficiently catalyse the CER. This single-atom catalyst (SAC) shows superior CER activity with the ultralow thermodynamic overpotential of 0.014 V via the Cl* intermediate instead of the formation of the ClO*. Moreover, its high theoretical overpotential of OER inherently promotes the selectivity of chlorine evolution. The analyses of the bonding mechanism between TM and Cl atoms reveal that their electrostatic attraction forces can be a good descriptor for the discovery of high-performance CER electrocatalysts. Our findings may broaden the scope of CER catalysts design beyond DSAs with the maximized metal atom utilization.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			1572-6657	1873-2569		WOS:000767855800007

However, it is challenging to combine these strategies in one system to realize the full catalytic potential. Now, an Ar/O-2 plasma method is used to simultaneously induce exfoliation, surface reorganization (formation of an oxidative layer with rich oxygen vacancies), and phase transformation (cubic-to-orthorhombic) on CoSe2 to generate an exceptionally outstanding OER electrocatalysts. The as-made samples require an overpotential of only 251 mV at 10 mA cm(-2), outperforming commercial RuO2 and most reported OER catalysts. The striking catalytic activity originates from the optimized chemical and electronic environment. This work provides valuable insights into the design of promising OER electrocatalysts with high natural abundance via multilevel structural modulation.									85	8	0	0	3	0	86			1433-7851	1521-3773		WOS:000453346300029	30332523

The synthesized catalysts exhibit excellent activity for electrochemical oxygen evolution reaction due to the hierarchical heterostructures and synergistic effects of CoFe-OOH and Co2P.

In this work, a simple two-step biomass-assisted impregnation-calcination strategy was adopted to prepare a series of porous nickel/nickel oxide-nitrogen self-doped carbon (Ni/NiO-NC) nanosheet composites using waste corn stalks (CSs) as a multifunctional template, reductant, and carbon and nitrogen sources. The contents of carbon, nickel, and nickel oxide components can be adjusted by varying the calcination temperature and CS amount. When they are applied as electrocatalysts in the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), the optimal Ni/NiO-NC nanosheet obtained at 300 degrees C and 1.00 g of CS displays the best OER and HER activities in 1.0 M KOH media with low overpotentials of 293 and 179 mV at 10 mV cm(-2), small Tafel slopes of 141 and 111 mV dec(-1), respectively, and good stability. Furthermore, a water electrolyzer is also fabricated by utilizing cheap nonprecious Ni/NiO-NC-300 as both OER and HER catalysts to investigate the water-splitting performance. This as-reported simple, environmental, and cheap strategy could be extended to develop other two-dimensional transition-metal-based nanosheet electrocatalysts for a high-performance water-splitting reaction.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6				2574-0970		WOS:000757904100001

The CFPs covered with CoFe204 NPs show orders of magnitude higher OER performance than bare CFP due to high activity of CoFe2O4 NPs, leading to a small overpotential of 378 mV to get a current density of 10 mA/cm(2). Significantly, the CoFe2O4 NPs-on-CFP electrodes exhibit remarkably long stability evaluated by continuous cycling (over 15 h) and operation with a high current density at a fixed potential (over 40 h) without any morphological change and with preservation of all materials within the electrode. Furthermore, the CoFe2O4 NPs-on-CFP electrodes also exhibit hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) performance, which is considerably higher than that of bare CFP, acting as a bifunctional electrocatalyst. The achieved results show promising potential for efficient, cost-effective, and durable hydrogen generation at large scales using earth-abundant materials and cheap fabrication processes.									107	3	0	0	3	0	107			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000360027100039	26217939

The replacement of Mn4+ ion with more electronegative Re4+ one is quite effective in weakening adjacent (Mn-O) bonds in terms of bond competition, leading to the stabilization of Jahn-Teller active Mn3+ species, as well as in providing electrocatalytically active Ru sites. The resulting Ru-substituted alpha-Mn1-xRuxO2 nanowires show much higher electrocatalyst activities for both oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) than does the physical mixture of alpha-MnO2 and RuO2, indicating the main role of (Mn-O) bond covalency in the optimization of the bifunctional electrocatalyst activity of manganese oxide. The present study underscores that, like the previous strategy of structural disorder enhancement, the substitution of highly electronegative cation can provide a novel efficient way of improving the electrocatalyst performance of manganese oxide via the bond competition between adjacent (Ru-O) and (Mn-O) bonds.									31	1	0	0	3	0	31			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000437965900011

Herein, we design and synthesize amorphous NiFe nanotube arrays on nickel foam (NiFe NTAs-NF) with high electrocatalytic activity and excellent durability for both OER and HER in overall water splitting. The as-synthesized NiFe NTAs-NF only requires relatively low overpotentials of 216 mV for the OER and 181 mV for the HER to reach current densities of 50 and 10 mA cm(-2), respectively. Moreover, when used as bifunctional catalysts for water splitting, the designed electrode only needs a low cell voltage of 1.62 V to obtain 10 mA cm(-2) for the overall water splitting, with an extremely excellent durability. The excellent performance of the NiFe NTAs-NF might be attributed to the synergistic effect and amorphous phase of NiFe alloy as well as the well-defined nanotube array architecture with large surface area, abundant active sites, and sufficient gas and electrolyte diffusion channels.									50	2	0	0	0	0	50			2574-0962			WOS:000458705200036

The porous, 3-dimensional conductive and free standing nature of the graphene sponge makes it become excellent skeleton of cathode for lithium-oxygen battery. The Fe-N-C catalyst nanoparticles dispersed uniformly on the graphene sheets show excellent catalytic reactivity in both discharge and charge processes. This kind of composite material greatly improves the capacity and cyclability of the lithium-oxygen battery. With dimethyl sulphoxide as electrolyte, the capacity reaches 6762 mAh g(-1) which is twice of the pure graphene sponge. In addition, the cell containing Fe-N-GS air electrode exhibits stable cyclic performance and effective reduction of charge potential plateau, indicating that Fe-N-GS is promising as an OER catalyst in rechargeable lithium-air batteries.

The hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) by water splitting are feasible ways to produce clean sustainable energy. Here, atomic structures and related scanning tunneling microscope images of Se defects in PtSe2 are systematically explored. The equilibrium fractions of vacancies under variable conditions are predicted in detail. In addition, it is found that the vacancies are highly kinetically stable, without recovering or aggregation. The Se vacancies in PtSe2 can dramatically enhance the HER performance, comparing to Pt(111). It is also revealed that a PtSe2 monolayer with Se vacancies is also a good OER catalyst. The excellent bipolar catalysis of Se vacancies is further confirmed by experimental measurements. A defective PtSe2 made via direct selenization of Pt foil at 773 K using a chemical vapor deposition process is produced. It is shown that the HER and OER performance of defective PtSe2 is much more efficient than Pt foils by a series of measurements.

This is hindered by the large overpotentials of the oxygen evolution reaction ( OER) and oxygen reduction reaction ( ORR) in alkaline media, where peroxide is an undesired side product. We study the suitability of epitaxial ( 001)- oriented La0.6 Sr0.4MnO3 perovskite surfaces as a bifunctional catalyst using a rotating- ring disk electrode ( RRDE) assembly and focus particularly on the selectivity of the ORR. The peroxide yield is above 50% during ORR- only investigations in the scan range of 0.69 to 0.99 V vs. RHE where the CV traces are reproducible. In contrast, the peroxide yield is drastically reduced during OER- ORR cycling where a peroxide yield below 10% is reached during the ORR in the scan range of 0.74 V to 1.74 V vs. RHE. Our study highlights the importance of the electrode history and thus clearly demonstrates that separate studies of the OER and ORR are insufficient to optimize bifunctional electrocatalysts.									9	0	0	0	0	0	9				2566-6223		WOS:000477087800009

The defect concentrations depend on the gas phase and can be modified by the overpotential. These interrelationships make a mechanistic analysis of partial pressure-dependent. current-voltage experiments challenging. In this contribution it is described how to exploit this complex situation to unravel the kinetic roles of surface adsorbates and electrode point defects. Essential is a counterbalancing of oxygen partial pressure and dc electrode polarization such that the point defect concentrations in the electrode remain constant despite varying the oxygen partial pressure. It is exemplarily shown for La0.6Sr0.4FeO3-delta (LSF) thin film electrodes on yttria-stabilized zirconia how mechanistically relevant reaction orders can be obtained from current-voltage curves, measured in a three-electrode setup. This analysis strongly suggests electron holes as the limiting defect species for the oxygen evolution on LSF and reveals the dependence of the oxygen incorporation rate on the oxygen vacancy concentration. A virtual independence of the reaction rate from the oxygen partial pressure was empirically found for moderate oxygen pressures. This effect, however, arises from a counterbalancing of defect and adsorbate concentration changes.									21	0	0	0	1	0	21			0897-4756	1520-5002		WOS:000438653300009	30100672

In this paper, the nickel cobalt phosphide (CoNiP) microstructure was prepared by the "in situ growth-ion exchange-phosphating" method. Due to the flake structure and the synergistic effect of the bimetal, the synthesized CoNiP microstructure exhibited high electrocatalytic activity and stability for hydrogen and oxygen evolution in alkaline electrolyte. The optimized CoNiP showed low overpotential of 116 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) for hydrogen evolution reaction and 400 mV at 50 mA cm(-2) for oxygen evolution reaction in KOH solution. In addition, it exhibited long-term stability at a high constant current density of 100 mA cm(-2) for 48 hours at room temperature and for 65 hours at 80 degrees C without significant degradation. Theoretical results showed that the introduction of Co and P atoms could reduce the reaction barrier and improve the electron transfer ability. This work provides a simple and economical way for the synthesis of electrocatalytic bimetal phosphide catalysts.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1				2046-2069		WOS:000771710200001	35424856

Herein, we prepared a unique composite structure, uniformly spherical Ni-MOF decorated with NiMoO4 nanorods on Ni foam (NF), and assessed its performance toward oxygen evolution reaction. The synergistic effect between NiMoO4 and Ni-MOF remarkably promoted the OER intrinsic activity. Moreover, introducing NiMoO4 endowed the composite structure with enhanced electrical conductivity and exposed more active sites. The NiMoO4/Ni-MOF/NF electrode exhibited exceptional electrocatalytic activity in 1.0 M KOH aqueous solution, with a low overpotential of 218 mV to drive the current density of 10 mA cm(-2) and a low Tafel slope (67.75 mV dec(-1)), surpassing the benchmark RuO2 .

Taking the advantages of sputter deposition, a high entropy alloy (HEA) thin film electrocatalyst is hereby reported for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The catalyst characteristics are investigated not only in its as-deposited state, but also during and after the OER. For comparison, unary, binary, ternary, and quaternary thin film catalysts are prepared and characterized. The surface electronic structure modification due to the addition of a metal is studied experimentally and theoretically using density functional theory calculation. It is demonstrated that sputtered FeNiMoCrAl HEA thin film exhibits OER performance superior to all the reported HEA catalysts with robust electrocatalytic activity having a low overpotential of 220 mV at 10 mA cm(-2), and excellent electrochemical stability at different constant current densities of 10 and 100 mA cm(-2) for 50 h. Furthermore, the microstructure transformation is investigated during the OER, which is important for the understanding of the OER mechanism provided by HEA electrocatalyst.

We observe the HBB reaction and also Oxygen depletion (massive stars) or Oxygen production (like Carbon) during the 3rd dredge-up (more efficient at lower metallicity).

The effects of Ni content on the morphology, structure and catalyst performance for oxygen evolution reaction are investigated by scanning electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction spectroscopy and electrochemical techniques including cyclic voltammetry, chronopotentiometry and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. A transformation from nanowire arrays to nanoplate arrays is found with the increase of the atomic ratio of Ni to Co in the preparation solution. The NixCo3-xO4 electrode obtained at 1:1 of Ni:Co in the preparation solution exhibits nanowire array structure and has better catalytic performance for oxygen evolution reaction than other NixCo3-xO4 and Co3O4 electrodes. The catalytic activities of the NixCo3-xO4 and Co3O4 electrodes are correlated with their surface roughness. Superior stability of the NixCo3-xO4 nanowire array electrode is demonstrated by a chronopotentiometric test. The reaction orders with respect to OH- on the NixCo3-xO4 electrode are close to 2 and 1 at low and high overpotentials, respectively. (C) 2010 Professor T. Nejat Veziroglu.

Nickel oxide (NiO) nanoparticles are a potential low-cost oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrocatalyst, and its catalytic activity and stability are still to be further improved. The construction of interfacial catalysts can improve their electrocatalytic activity. In this work, we report that nickel oxide (NiO) nanoclusters supported on chromium oxide (Cr2O3) nanosheets form a novel NiO-Cr2O3 heterostructure as an effective electrocatalyst for OER. Compared with pristine NiO and Cr2O3, NiO-Cr2O3 exhibits higher OER activity with smaller overpotential of 270 mV and lower Tafel slope of 30 mVdec(-1), as well as durability under alkaline conditions. The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, In-situ Raman spectra and theoretical calculations reveal a source of high catalytic activity of NiO-Cr2O3. The results show that the activity site is located at Cr-Ni site of the NiO-Cr2O3. Due to the obvious charge transfer between Cr and Ni atoms at the interface, the change of Ni and Cr electronic structure reduces the adsorption energy of oxygen species and increases their catalytic activity. This work constructs a new Cr-Ni interface coupling method through NiO-Cr2O3 heterostructure, which provides a new strategy for designing new efficient and inexpensive OER catalysts.

However, the efficiency of the whole device is largely limited by the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) at the anode due to its sluggish kinetics. Thus, it is imperative to develop inexpensive, highly active OER catalysts to lower the reaction barriers. By examining the underlying critical factors for OER performance, this review outlines general principles for designing efficient nanosized OER catalysts, including (1) enhancing the intrinsic activity of active site by electronic modulation, crystallinity modulation, phase control, defect engineering and spin state engineering; (2) designing appropriate micro/meso/macro structure with high electrical conductivity and mechanical stability to maximize the quantity of accessible active sites, and to promote electron transfer during OER process, as well as to achieve high durability especially at high current density. A series of highly efficient OER catalysts developed by our and other groups are then exemplified to demonstrate the guidance of these principles. At last, some perspectives are highlighted in the further development of efficient OER electrocatalysts, of which can contribute greatly to the achievement in large-scale commercialization of electrocatalytic water-splitting technology.			电催化水分解反应是可以实现规模化制取氢气的一种重要绿色无污染的手段, 但是其效率极大地受制于阳极析氧反应. 因此,发展廉价、高效的析氧反应催化剂是当下的研究热点. 通过分析决定析氧反应催化活性的因素,本综述总结了低成本、高效、稳定的析氧电催化剂的一些通用设计与制备策略,包括:1)通过电子结构调控、结晶度调控、相调控、缺陷位调控以及自旋态调控提升单个催化活性位点的本征催化活性;2)设计与构筑先进电极结构,以实现活性位点数量最大化,获得大电流下稳定的电极材料. 进而,选取了一些具有代表性的高效析氧催化剂作为例子来阐述这些策略的实用性. 最后,对高效、可在大电流密度下稳定工作的析氧催化剂的理性设计、可控制备和发展方向提出了展望,以期为新型高性能析氧催化剂的设计提供指导.						7	0	0	0	0	0	7			1006-3471			CSCD:6368174

Developing efficient, inexpensive and durable electrocatalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) has been one of the major focuses of applied electrochemistry and has attracted considerable research attention in the past decades. Non-oxide based transition metal compounds, typically transition metal phosphides (TMPs) and chalcogenides (TMCs), have recently emerged as new categories of OER pre-catalysts, demonstrated outstanding electrocatalytic performance as compared to the conventional oxide- or hydroxide-based OER catalysts for alkaline water electrolysis, and even shown promise to replace noble metals for proton-exchange membrane (PEM) water electrolysis. In this feature article, we will summarize the latest advances in the development of TMP- and TMC-based OER electrocatalysts. In particular, we will discuss the electrochemical stability of TMPs and TMCs predicted using Pourbaix diagrams and their morphological, structural and compositional evolution under OER conditions.

In this context, this work reports mixed-valence oxide samples of the MnXCo3-XO4 type (0 <= X <= 1) synthesized for the first time by the proteic sol-gel method using Agar-Agar as a polymerizing agent. The powders were calcined at 1173 K, characterized by FESEM, XRD, RAMAN, UV-Vis, FT-IR, VSM, and XPS analyses, and were investigated as electrocatalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Through XRD analysis, it was observed that the pure cubic phase was obtained for all samples. The presence of Co3+, Co2+, Mn2+, Mn3+, and Mn4+ was confirmed by X-ray spectroscopy (XPS). Regarding the magnetic measurements, a paramagnetic behavior at 300 K was observed for all samples. As far as OER is concerned, it was investigated in an alkaline medium, where the best overpotential of 299 mV vs. RHE was observed for the sample (MnCo2O4), which is a lower value than those of noble metal electrocatalysts in the literature, together with a Tafel slope of 52 mV dec(-1), and excellent electrochemical stability for 15 h. Therefore, the green synthesis method presented in this work showed great potential for obtaining electrocatalysts used in the oxygen evolution reaction for water splitting.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0				2079-4991		WOS:000856736900001	36144958

Melamine pyrolysis together with a Co precursor results in MWCNTs, with the addition of sulfur during synthesis enhancing the surface area, pore size, and oxygen vacancy defects in the nanotubes. The hierarchical structure of Co/Co9S8/CNT products boosted the electron mobility and mass transport for both the oxygen evolution (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in alkaline medium. Doping the catalyst surface with Pyridinic-N atoms, Graphitic-N atoms and thioamide S-atoms dramatically improved the bifunctional electrocatalytic performance by lowering the overpotentials for OER and HER reactions. The Co/Co9S8/CNT generated a current density of 10 mAcm(-2) water-splitting current by applying a cell voltage of only 1.5 V. Further, Co/Co9S8/CNT showed excellent stability. The mechanism of Co8S9 nanowire formation in the MWCNT was also investigated. (C) 2020 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Ltd.									17	1	0	0	0	0	17			0013-4686	1873-3859		WOS:000608744400001

At present, developing low-cost and highly efficient electrocatalysts has attracted increasing attention. Herein, a novel composited catalyst of ZnxNi1-xS@Mo2C loaded on conductive carbon cloth (ZnxNi1-xS@Mo2C/CC) is successfully prepared by the hydrothermal method. Due to the abundant active sites of defect structures induced by the surface engineering, the prepared ZnxNi1-xS@Mo2C/CC shows outstanding electrocatalytic performances in hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) of water splitting, with low overpotential of 230 mV and 150 mV at 10 mA cm(-2), respectively. The ZnxNi1-xS@Mo2C/CC as an OER/HER bifunctional catalyst for overall water splitting affords a stable voltage of 1.56 V@current density of 10 mA cm(-2). Moreover, the catalyst shows an outstanding stability after a series of electrochemical tests. This work expands the multi-field applications of carbon cloth-supported materials as efficient non-precious metal-based electrocatalysts, with great importance in sustainable energy-relative technologies.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0042-207X	1879-2715		WOS:000747122900002

However, no matter in hydrogen production, storage, transportation or application, there are still huge challenges hindering the development of hydrogen energy. Transition metal carbides (TMCs) and nitrides (TMNs) have been received widespread attention in electrocatalytic water splitting to obtain hydrogen due to its noble-metal-like characteristic. In this review, we make a basic introduction including the structure, physical properties, and common prepared method of TMCs/TMNs. Then briefly introduce the reaction mechanism and evaluation criteria of electrochemical water splitting. After that, this paper reviews the recent progress of in the de-velopment of transition metal carbides and nitrides which discussion focused on the different modification methods such as nanostructuring, heteroatom doping, heterostructure construction and defect engineering. Furthermore, this review summarizes the electrocatalytic performances of recent reported TMCs and TMNs in hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and overall water splitting.

The conditions for Ni electrodepositon are determined on the basis of the results of half-cell tests for hydrogen and oxygen evolution reactions. An MEA fabricated by the direct electrodeposition of an extremely low Ni amount of 8.5 mu g(Ni) cm(-2) exhibits a high cell performance of 150 mA cm(-2) at 1.9 V when a 1.0 M KOH solution is supplied to the cathode. Electrodeposited Ni is uniformly distributed on the surface of CP fibers, thereby providing a large electrochemical surface area for gas evolution reactions and thus maintaining high catalyst utilization. It is suggested that control of bubble generation and AEMs with higher ionic conductivity would further increase MEA performance. (c) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Moreover, the anode product, O-2, which is of rather low value, may lead to dangerous explosions and the generation of membrane-degrading reactive oxygen species. Herein, to address these issues of electrocatalytic H-2 production, we summarize the most recent advances in three stages based on the benefit increments and various electron donation routes, which are: 1) electron donation by traditional OER: developing efficient catalysts for water oxidation to promote H-2 production; 2) electron donation by the oxidation of sacrificial agents: using sacrificial agents to assist H-2 production; 3) electron donation by electrosynthesis reaction: achieving electrosynthesis in parallel with cathodic H-2 production. Present challenges and related prospects will also be discussed, hopefully to benefit the further progress of electrocatalytic H-2 generation.									66	1	0	0	6	0	66			1433-7851	1521-3773		WOS:000630077000001	32914487

Developing efficient, durable, low-cost, and earth-abundant electrocatalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is of great urgency. To achieve the rapid synthesis of transition-metal nitride nanostructures and improve their electrocatalytic performance, a new strategy has been developed to convert cobalt oxide precursors into cobalt nitride nanowires through N-2 radio frequency plasma treatment. This method requires significantly shorter reaction times (about 1 min) at room temperature compared to conventional high-temperature NH3 annealing which requires a few hours. The plasma treatment significantly enhances the OER activity, as evidenced by a low overpotential of 290 mV to reach a current density of 10 mA cm(-2), a small Tafel slope, and long-term durability in an alkaline electrolyte.									560	31	0	0	24	0	564			1433-7851	1521-3773		WOS:000383253500033	27254484

Along with the edge and surface sites of NiFe-LDH for both oxygen evolution reaction and oxygen reduction reaction activities, the unprecedented activity of the ReS2/NiFe-LDH heteronanosheets for the hydrogen evolution reaction emerges from the S-O bonds at the heterointerfaces, together with the strong coupling effect and vertical alignment of NiFe-LDH and ReS2. The outstanding trifunctional activities and a well understood mechanism ensure the use of ReS2/NiFe-LDH heteronanosheets for the development of integrated cascade battery/electrolyzer systems, in which electricity storage in the battery mode and H-2 production in the electrolyzer mode are efficiently switched with high round-trip efficiency (61%) and Faraday efficiency (96%).

Herein, a composite electrocatalyst consisting of highly dispersed Co/CoP heterojunction embedded within a hierarchically ordered macroporous-mesoporous-microporous carbon matrix (Co/CoP@HOMC) is rationally designed through the pyrolysis of polystyrene sphere-templated zeolite imidazolate framework-67 (ZIF-67) assemblies. The combined experimental and theoretical calculations reveal that Co/CoP interfaces not only provide richly exposed active sites but also optimize hydrogen/water absorption free energy via electronic coupling, while the interconnected macroporous structure enables a superior mass transfer to all accessible active sites. As a result, the as-developed Co/CoP@HOMC composites exhibit outstanding catalytic activity with overpotentials of only 120 and 260 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) for the hydrogen evolution reaction and oxygen evolution reaction in 1.0 m KOH, respectively. Moreover, an alkaline electrolyzer constructed by Co/CoP@HOMC requires an ultralow cell voltage of 1.54 V to achieve 10 mA cm(-2), outperforming that of the Pt@C||IrO2@C couple (1.64 V).									35	1	0	0	1	0	34			1614-6832	1614-6840		WOS:000705034900001

The NF supported heterostructure possesses three-dimensional (3D) catalytic space and strained heterointerface. Thereinto the Co1-xS layer provides extra active sites over the original NiFe LDH. Besides, the lattice mismatch in the surface of NiFe LDH induces the formation of lattice strain in Co1-xS, which thus modulates the local electronic structures. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations validate that the strained heterointerface has advantageous OER activity. From the results of electrochemical tests, the NiFe LDH/Co1-xS possesses large number of active sites and fast charge transfer. More importantly, optimized structure and interface characteristics improve the electrocatalytic stability, resulting in long-term durability with almost no attenuation after 150 h constant current test.

Here, we report a new and facile one-step electrodeposition of nanocrystalline spinel-type ZnxCo3-xO4 films from an alkaline Zn2+- Co2+-tartrate solution. The electrodeposited ZnxCo3-xO4 electrode could be directly used as the anode for the water electrolysis without any post treatment. The ZnxCo3-xO4 film shows a low and stable overpotential of, similar to 0.33 V at 10 mA cm(-2) (and similar to 0.35 V at 20 mA cm(-2)) for over 10 h and a Tafel slope of similar to 39 mV dec(-1) toward the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in 1 M NaOH, comparable to the best performance of the nonprecious OER catalysts reported for alkaline media. The enhanced OER activity of ZnxCo3-xO4 compared to Co3O4 could be attributed to the surface structural modification and higher density of the accessible active Co3+ sites induced by the incorporation of Zn2+.

The oxidation half-reaction, the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), is a complex four-electron process that constitutes an efficiency bottleneck in water splitting. Here we report a highly active OER catalyst, cobalt vanadium oxide. The catalyst is designed on the basis of a volcano plot of metal-OH bond strength and activity. The catalyst can be synthesized by a facile hydrothermal route. The most active pure-phase material (a-CoVOx) is X-ray amorphous and provides a 10 mA cm(-2) current density at an overpotential of 347 mV in 1 M KOH electrolyte when immobilized on a flat substrate. The synthetic method can also be applied to coat a high-surface-area substrate such as nickel foam. On this three-dimensional substrate, the a-CoVOx catalyst is highly active, reaching 10 mA cm(-2) at 254 mV overpotential, with a Tafel slope of only 35 mV dec(-1). This work demonstrates a-CoVOx as a promising electrocatalyst for oxygen evolution and validates M-OH bond strength as a practical descriptor in OER catalysis.									159	8	0	0	2	0	160			2155-5435			WOS:000419751100065	29333330

This distribution cannot be reached with charge recombination reactions between the higher S states and the electron acceptor Q(B)(-). We measured flash-induced oxygen evolution to understand how S-3 and S-2 are converted to lower S states when the electron required to reduce the manganese cluster does not come from Q(B)(-). Thylakoid samples preconditioned to make the concentration of the S-1 state 100% and to oxidize tyrosine Y-D were illuminated by one or two laser preflashes, and flash-induced oxygen evolution sequences were recorded at various time intervals after the preflashes. The distribution of the S states was calculated from the flash-induced oxygen evolution pattern using an extended Kok model. The results suggest that S-2 and S-3 are converted to lower S states via recombination from S(2)Q(B)(-) and S(3)Q(B)(-) and by a slow change of the state of oxygen-evolving complex from S-3 and S-2 to S, and So in reactions with unspecified electron donors. The slow pathway appears to contain two-electron routes, S(2)Q(B) -> S(0)Q(B), and S(3)Q(B) -> S(1)Q(B). The two-electron reactions dominate in intact thylakoid preparations in the absence of chemical additives. The two-electron reaction was replaced by a one-electron-per-step pathway, S(3)Q(B) -> S(2)Q(B) -> S(1)Q(B) in PS II-enriched membrane fragments and in thylakoids measured in the presence of artificial electron acceptors. A catalase effect suggested that H2O2 acts as an electron donor for the reaction S(2)Q(B) -> S(0)Q(B) but added H2O2 did not enhance this reaction.									11	0	0	0	10	0	11			0006-3495			WOS:000266650400031	19486689	
J	Guo, YL; Groiss, R; Doring, H; Garche, J								Rate-determining step investigations of oxidation processes at the positive plate during pulse charge of valve-regulated lead-acid batteries								JOURNAL OF THE ELECTROCHEMICAL SOCIETY				146	11			3949	3957		10.1149/1.1392575				NOV 1999	1999	The kinetic processes of both PbSO4 oxidation and the oxygen evolution reactions were studied under pulse charging conditions. Three hinds of diffusion processes appeared in the positive active mass. The time intervals required to relax the respective concentration polarizations were about 0.1, 300. and more than 10000 s. At the beginning of the pulse charge, the passivation layer formed between the grid and active mass at the positive plates exhibited a poor electronic conductivity and impeded the diffusion of O atoms. Thus, the electrode polarization increased and oxygen evolution accelerated. Following the initial pulse, the diffusion of O atoms became rapid while the concentration of ions such as HSO4- and SO42- at the reaction surface increased gradually so that their dif fusion became dominant in the solution near the reaction surface. For longer times, the charge rate was controlled by the diffusion of these ions in the micropores of the active mass. The electrode polarization. oxygen evolution, and loss of water can be inhibited by using a pulse discharge or/and prolonging the off-time of pulse charge. (C) 1999 The Electrochemical Society.

Herein, bimetallic transition metal oxide incorporated three-dimensional (3D) nitrogen-doped graphene/carbon nanotube (CNT) conducive matrix has been developed via dry synthesis and applied as a potential catalyst for the oxygen and hydrogen evolution reactions. The key features of the structure as well as its 3D network, nitrogen doping, and metal oxide formation were confirmed using various characterization techniques such as scanning electron and transmission electron microscopies, X-ray diffraction, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. A nickel cobalt oxide-incorporated 3D nitrogen-doped graphene/CNT conducive matrix (NCGC) exhibits low overpotentials of 290 and 214 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) to drive the oxygen and hydrogen evolution reactions, respectively. Furthermore, the NCGC electrocatalyst maintains a reasonably long-term water electrolysis performance over 20 h, thought to be as a result of an improvement in the activity and stability of NCGC through the synergetic effects of the bimetallic transition oxide and 3D nitrogen-doped graphene/CNT. The overall electrochemical activity and stability of the prepared NCGC make it a good economical substitute for commercial noble metal-based catalysts for use in renewable energy production.									30	0	0	0	1	0	30			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000510846500166

The complex is solvothermally decomposed in octadecylamine (ODA) to yield ternary copper molybdenum sulfide nanoparticles and successfully grafted onto 2D materials, namely, reduced graphene oxide (rGO) or polyaniline (PANI), and these composites are utilized for oxygen evolution half-cell reaction (OER). The copper molybdenum sulfide nanoparticles as well as their composites with rGO and PANI and rGO + PANI were characterized using powder X-ray diffraction, SEM, and EDX analyses. Electrochemical measurements suggested that the modified electrodes have notable electrocatalytic activity toward OER with onset overpotential 400 mV for CMS + PANI and 395 mV for CMS + rGO + PANI. This is the first study on the use of copper molybdenum sulfide nanoparticles composites with rGO and PANI as electrocatalysts for OER displaying substantial synergistic activity.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0268-2605	1099-0739		WOS:000779947200001

Herein, the bimetallic zinc-cobalt layered double hydroxide nanosheets (ZnCo-LDH NS) have been facilely synthesized using 2-methylimidazole as a bifunctional alkali source (OH-) and a morphological controlling reagent by the one-step room-temperature reaction. The mechanism study shows that the weak organic base of 2-methylimidazole-induced slow release of OH- in water/ethanol is the controlling factor for the formation of the LDH nanosheets. The ZnCo-LDH NS modified on glassy carbon electrode exhibited an overpotential of 385 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) and a Tafel slope of 108 mV dec(-1) in 1.0 M KOH for oxygen evolution reaction, outperforming the corresponding the monometal oxides of Zn-OH, Co-OH, the NaOH produced ZnCo-LDH microparticles, and even the benchmark catalyst of RuO2 at high current density. Characterization experiments indicated that the outstanding electrocatalytic activity can be ascribed to the nanosheet-induced surface area effect, excellent electronic conductivity, and the coupling effect between Zn2+ and Co2+ in the material. This work offers a facile and environmental-friendly method for synthesising LDH nanosheets bearing enhanced oxygen evolution reaction activity. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc.

However, most OER cocatalysts are based on noble metal oxides. Besides, the loose interface between semiconductor and cocatalyst results in inefficient charge transfer. The fabrication of photocatalysts with integrated light-harvesting and catalytic centers for OER is therefore desired. Herein, we provide a photocarving strategy to create nitrogen vacancies (NVs) on polymeric carbon nitride (PCN). It is confirmed that the embedded NVs can function as active sites to catalyze OER, while promoting the transfer of the photogenerated charge for OER. As a result, PCN-NVs without any extra noble-metal cocatalyst assistance exhibit an enhanced oxygen evolution rate compared with the pristine PCN. Additionally, the PCN obtained from other precursors can also be engineered by this photocarving method, while promoting oxygen photosynthesis. This work provides an avenue to design light-transducers with combined light-harvesting and catalytic configurations for oxygen synthesis chemistry.									57	2	0	0	3	0	57			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000483451200013

But there is a huge unexplored area of research where phosphorene-based catalysts could find new applications. Among these are the urgency of making new functionalized phosphorene materials and studying their catalytic (including photo and electrocatalytic) activities in various types of reactions. Phosphorene has a wide range of emerging applications in the field of energy conversion and storage, photovoltaic devices, and biomedical applications. However, the application of 2D phosphorene-based catalyst in the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), oxygen evolution reaction (OER), reduction of CO2 into green fuels, and the nitrogen electroreduction reaction (N2RR) have not been explored further. Herein, state-of-the-art synthetic strategies of 2D phosphorene produced from allotropes of black phosphorus with their significant role as nanocatalysts in the HER, OER, hydrogen storage, electrochemical reduction of CO2 into valuable green fuels, and the N2RR are focused on.

To improve its efficiency, highly robust catalysts are required to reduce the overpotential for low electrical power consumption. Heteroatom modification is one of the most effective strategies for boosting catalytic performance, as it can regulate the physicochemical properties of host catalysts to improve their intrinsic activity. Herein, aiming to provide an overview of the impact of heteroatoms on catalytic activity at the atomic level, we present a review of the key role of heteroatoms in enhancing reaction kinetics based on the reaction pathways of the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in alkaline media. In particular, the introduction of heteroatoms can directly and indirectly optimize the interactions between the active sites and intermediates, thus improving the intrinsic activity. To clearly illustrate this influence in detail, we have summarized a series of representative heteroatom-modified electrocatalysts and discussed the important roles of heteroatoms in the OER and HER reaction pathways. Finally, some challenges and perspectives for heteroatom-modified electrodes are discussed. We hope that this review will be helpful for the development of efficient and low-cost electrocatalysts for water electrolysis and other energy conversion applications.

J	Chen, Yen-Jhih; Chen, Liang-Yih								The study of carrier transfer mechanism for nanostructural hematite photoanode for solar water splitting								APPLIED ENERGY				164				924	933		10.1016/j.apenergy.2015.08.105				FEB 15 2016	2016	Due to the band gap of hematite (alpha-Fe2O3) (E-g = 2.1 eV) in visible light region, it is regarded as suitable n-type semiconductor material for solar water splitting. Although theoretical conversion efficiency can achieve 12.9%, the drawbacks of hematite, such as short hole diffusion length (similar to 10 nm), poor charge transport and slow oxygen evolution kinetic rate, cause the generated holes being trapped in photo anodes for low conversion efficiency. In this study, hematite nanorods photoanode was prepared via hydrothermal method and the grain sizes of hematite nanorods increased by adding absolute ethanol into growth aqueous solution. In addition, the morphologies observed by SEM showed that hematite nanorods transformed to nanocorals due to the addition of ethanol. To improve the electrical conductivity for reducing carrier recombination, Ti4+ ions were doped into hematite nanocorals photoanode. Herein, the photocurrent density of Ti-doped hematite nanocorals photoanode could achieve 1.72 mA/cm(2) at 1.23 V (vs. RHE). Finally, the surfaces of hematite nanocorals photoanode was decorated by ZnFe2O4 heterojunction layer and Co-Pi oxygen evolution catalysts (OECs) to improve the oxygen evolution reaction. The current density and power conversion efficiency could furthermore improve to 3.60 mA/cm(2) at 1.23 V and 0.33%, respectively. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Here, we report a novel strategy with erbium-doped NiCoP nanowire arrays in situ grown on conductive nickel foam (Er-NiCoP/NF). Significantly, the developed electrode shows exceptional bifunctional catalytic activity, which only requires overpotentials of 46 and 225 mV to afford a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), respectively. Density functional theory calculations reveal that the appropriate Er incorporation into the NiCoP lattice can significantly modulate the electronic structure with the d-band centers of Ni and Co atoms by shifting to lower energies with respect to the Fermi level, and optimize the Gibbs free energies of HER/OER intermediates, thereby accelerating water-splitting kinetics. When assembled as a solar-driven overall water-splitting electrolyzer, the as-prepared electrode shows a high and stable solar-to-hydrogen efficiency of 19.6%, indicating its potential for practical storage of intermittent energy.									1	0	0	0	1	0	1				2637-9368		WOS:000807975000001

It has been shown that CeO2 nanoplates with an average diameter of 18.6 nm have uniform contact with Co(OH)(2). The objective of the present study was to comprehensively investigate CeO2/Co(OH)(2) hybrid catalysts using various structural and electrochemical analysis to understand the synergetic effect between CeO2 and Co(OH)(2) beneficial interaction on oxygen evolution and hydrogen evolution reaction (OER and HER) characteristics. OER/HER results showed excellent catalytic activity of CeO2/Co(OH)(2) hybrid catalysts with an overpotential of 410 (OER) and 317 mV (HER) compared to pure CeO2 nanoplates and Co(OH)(2) powder. Corresponding Tafel slopes of CeO2/Co(OH)(2) hybrid catalysts for OER and HER were 66 and 140 mV dec(-1), respectively, lower than those of evaluated CeO2 nanoplates and Co(OH)(2) powder. Compared to bare CeO2 nanoplates and Co(OH)(2), CeO2/Co(OH)(2) hybrid catalysts exhibited remarkably enhanced electrocatalytic activity for OER and HER. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

The effects of oxygen on the electrochemical cycling are not well understood. Here, the detailed reaction scheme following oxygen evolution was established using real-time gas analysis and ex situ chemical analysis of the surface of the electrodes. A series of electrochemical/chemical reactions involving oxygen radicals constantly produced and decomposed lithium carbonate during cell operation. Moreover, byproducts, including water, affected the cycle life and rate capability: hydrolysis of the electrolyte salt formed hydrofluoric acid that attacked the surface of the electrode. This finding implies that protection of the electrode surface from damage, for example, by a coating or removal of oxygen radicals by scavengers, will be critical to widespread usage of Li-excess transition metal oxides in rechargeable lithium batteries.									216	9	0	0	10	0	226			0897-4756	1520-5002		WOS:000306674200010

Electrocatalytic oxygen reduction/evolution reactions (ORR/OER) are the cornerstone for renewable energy conversion and storage devices, such as fuel cells, electrolyzers, unitized regenerative fuel cells, and metal-air batteries. High-performance electrocatalysts are required to improve the ORR and OER activity and stability, and thus the device performance. Therefore, appropriate strategies and methods are crucial for the rational design and synthesis of highly efficient ORR/OER electrocatalysts. On the other hand, the conventional platinum-group-metal-based (PGM-based) catalysts, such as Pt and Ir/Ru (oxides), have been facing great challenges, including limited resources and high cost, leading to them being less competitive in the market. Thus, a lot of effort has been devoted to developing alternative PGM-free ORR/OER catalysts, which, however, still suffer from low activity and insufficient stability. In this review paper, the strategies for engineering high-performance PGM-free ORR and OER electrocatalysts are discussed by reviewing the most recent advances. At the end, perspectives on the methods to rationally design PGM-free ORR and OER catalysts are provided.									43	3	0	0	0	0	43			2366-9608			WOS:000540806600019

However, their catalytic properties are often limited by their poor electrical conductivity. Here, we present a strategy for enhancing the electrical conductivity of NiFe layered double hydroxide (LDH) in order to further improve its properties as an electrocatalyst for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in alkaline media. We show that NiFe LDH containing metal tetrasulfonate phthalocyanine in the interlayers between the NiFe oxide galleries can be coupled with graphene during liquid-phase exfoliation by taking advantage of their pi-pi stacking capabilities. A substantial enhancement in the electrocatalytic activity of NiFe LDH with respect to the OER was observed. Moreover, the activity and selectivity of the catalyst materials towards the oxygen reduction reaction were investigated, demonstrating that both the metal hydroxide layer and the interlayer species contribute to the electrocatalytic performance of the composite material.									9	1	0	0	1	0	9			1439-4235	1439-7641		WOS:000480860000001	31339219

The electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction is a major pathway to obtain ultra-pure hydrogen, and it vastly relies on the development of inexpensive electrocatalysts. In recent years, graphene has been proposed as a "metal-free" catalyst for the hydrogen evolution reaction. Here, we showed that metallic impurities are introduced during the synthesis process and these impurities act as the catalyst for the hydrogen evolution reaction.									15	1	0	0	0	0	15			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000471722100004	31144694

Herein, a low-cost, integrated composite of a Ni-Co metal-organic framework decorated with thin MoS2 nanosheets was synthesized by a simple hydrothermal method followed by carbonization and phosphorization for electrochemical oxygen and hydrogen evolution reactions. Such a composite heterostructure exhibits outstanding performance in the electrocatalysis process with a lower overpotential of 184 mV for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and 84 mV for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in 1.0 M KOH and 0.5 M H2SO4 electrolytes to reach a current density of 10 mA cm(-2), with a slight Tafel slope of 63 mV dec(-1) for the OER and 96 mV dec(-1) for the HER. The obtained results are far better than those of the commercial benchmark catalyst. Furthermore, online gas chromatography quantifies the amount of hydrogen generation in a symmetric cell as equal to 0.002121 moles with an energy efficiency of about 2.237 mg/kWh. Thus, the composite electrode's remarkable performance is further demonstrated as a potentially viable alternative non-noble electrocatalyst for energy conversion reactions.									11	0	0	0	1	0	11			0020-1669	1520-510X		WOS:000675430900071	34196173

J	Cui, Peng								Adiabatic and nonadiabatic charge separation dynamics in graphene oxide quantum dots for overall water splitting								NANOTECHNOLOGY				30	4					045201	10.1088/1361-6528/aaebcd				JAN 25 2019	2019	Chemical functionalization and heteroatom doping are two effective strategies for improving the conductivity of a graphene lattice. Nitrogen-doped graphene oxide quantum dot (GOQD) has been reported to possess both p- and n-conductivity that is induced by an oxygen functional group and nitrogen doping, respectively, and is suitable for catalyzing hydrogen and oxygen evolution reactions for complete water splitting. The experimental study shows that the hydrogen evolution reaction occurs considerably faster than the oxygen evolution reaction. However, the mechanism of this phenomenon remains unknown, which poses a challenge to the chemical modification of such classes of materials. In the present work, we perform nonadiabatic ab initio molecular dynamics to explore the charge separation dynamics in N-doped GOQD with oxygen functional groups. Our results show that there exists multiple charge decay channels governed by different mechanisms, which complicates the overall charge separation dynamics in N-doped GOQD. The intramolecular electron transfer mainly occurs through the nonadiabatic channel, whereas the intramolecular hole transfer mainly occurs through the adiabatic channel. There is an additional adiabatic decay channel in the p-domain, which accelerates electron-hole recombination in the p-domain. We further calculated the decoherence times and found that the decoherence of intramolecular electron transfer occurs considerably faster than that of hole transfer, which slows the quantum transition of intramolecular electron transfer. Finally, we simulated the carrier relaxation times and found that the electron relaxation is approximately one order of magnitude longer than that of the hole relaxation. Our calculation rationalizes the experimentally observed higher catalytic activity towards the hydrogen evolution compared to the oxygen evolution. More importantly, the calculation explains the fundamental roles of nitrogen doping and oxygen functional groups in the adiabatic and nonadiabatic charge decay mechanisms.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			0957-4484	1361-6528		WOS:000450909300001	30457975

The structure of the PLP cofactor allows for the stabilization of carbanions through resonance. A small number of PLP-dependent enzymes employ molecular oxygen as a cosubstrate. Here, we review the biological roles and possible mechanisms of these enzymes, and we observe that these enzymes are found in multiple protein families, suggesting that reaction with oxygen might have emerged de novo in several protein families and thus could be directed to emerge again through laboratory evolution experiments.									16	0	0	0	14	0	16			1742-464X	1742-4658		WOS:000521443500001	32142210

The work presented deals with the development of efficient PEM water electrolyzers, employing high specific surface area IrxPt1-xO2 electrocatalysts synthesized by the modified Adams fusion method. A typical three-electrode cell was used to evaluate the performance of the materials for water splitting. The performance of electrodes for oxygen evolution reaction was assessed by steady-state current potential measurements while their electrochemical characteristics and stability were studied by cyclic voltammetry. It was found that Ir-Pt bimetallic oxide electrodes present a stable performance for oxygen evolution reaction. Their intrinsic electrocatalytic activity in combination with their large surface area and stability are quite promising for the development of economically feasible electrocatalysts for PEM water electrolyzers.

J	Li, Yifan; Wang, Ting; Qin, Lingshuang; Yang, Shujiao; Zhang, Wei; Cao, Rui								Cu, Fe Dual-modified Ni3S2 nanosheets on nickel foam for bifunctional electrocatalytic water spitting								FLATCHEM				33						100368	10.1016/j.flatc.2022.100368				MAY 2022	2022	There are three fundamental issues in heterogeneous electrocatalysis, including the mass transport, the charge transfer and the electrochemical reaction kinetics. For 2D materials, the anisotropy brings advantage in charge transfer. However, the mass transport is often affected by the random stack of the 2D structures; the reaction kinetics is hampered by the exposed low-energy facets. Herein, we applied a two-step hydrothermal strategy to engineer the surface of nickel foam (NF) to prepare a bifunctional Cu3Fe7-Ni3S2/NF electrode for water electrolysis. This electrode combined several merits in electrocatalysis. The nanosheet structure of Ni3S2 is arrayed on the NF, and the surface is roughened by the doping. The roughened nanosheet array structure is efficient for mass transport; the autologous Ni3S2 provides rapid charge transfer between electrocatalyst and the metal substrate; the mixed metal sulfides display high intrinsic activity for water splitting. By the engineering of the 2D nanosheets, the prepared electrode has superior electrocatalytic performance and stability for overall water splitting under alkaline conditions. The bifunctional electrode exhibits an overpotential (eta) of 267 mV to drive a current density of 100 mA cm-2 for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and an overpotential of 148 mV to drive a current density of 10 mA cm-2 for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). It can be installed in two-electrode water electrolyzer to achieve a current density of 20 mA cm-2 with a cell voltage of 1.56 V.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2452-2627			WOS:000802032700005

The surface of three-dimensional copper foam is successfully roughened via one-step sulfurization reaction, and cuprous sulfide is formed on copper foam accordingly, which is denoted as Cu2S@Cu. The as-prepared Cu2S@Cu electrocatalyst exhibits remarkable performance on oxygen evolution reaction in basic solution, with a low overpotential of 345 mV to achieve 20 mA cm(-2). Cu2S@Cu also shows enhanced performance on hydrogen production, compared to the original copper foam. Furthermore, Cu2S@Cu can work as both cathode and anode in full water splitting, with superior activity to the noble metal-based electrocatalysts under large current densities. This study demonstrates that surface roughening technique on copper foam by sulfurization reaction can be valuable for developing novel copper-based electrocatalysts for water splitting.

Ranga								Review-Strategic Design of Layered Double Hydroxides and Graphitic Carbon Nitride Heterostructures for Photoelectrocatalytic Water Splitting Applications								JOURNAL OF THE ELECTROCHEMICAL SOCIETY				169	4					046515	10.1149/1945-7111/ac65b8				APR 1 2022	2022	The layered double hydroxides/graphitic carbon nitride (LDH/g-C3N4) heterostructures stand as promising photo- and electro-catalysts for water oxidation and reduction. These materials containing metal ions (Mp+ and M'q+), represented as Mp+M'q+- LDH/g-C3N4, have unique advantages over single component catalysts. This review provides the necessary insights on the material selection and mechanisms involved in electrocatalytic, photocatalytic, and photoelectrocatalytic water splitting processes. The importance of heterojunctions and interfacial chemistry in the water splitting mechanism is explained in detail by taking CuTi-LDH@g-C3N4 and Bi2O2 CO3/NiFe-LDH@g-C3N4 as examples. There is a synergistic effect between g-C3N4 and LDH layers that improves the performance of the hybrid materials over individual catalysts. This effect is due to the formation of Type II heterojunction in CuTi-LDH@g-C3N4 for oxygen evolution reaction, and of S-scheme mechanism in Bi2O2CO3/NiFe-LDH@g-C3N4 for both hydrogen and oxygen evolution reactions. Comparison of these two photoelectrocatalysts reveals new insights related to the role of synthesis method (hydrothermal vs coprecipitation), surface active sites (binary vs ternary heterostructures) and type of heterojunctions (Type II vs S-scheme), specifically, in the photoelectrocatalytic oxygen evolution reaction. These insights pave the way for further research in such multi-component hybrid materials to augment the progress in designing highly efficient heterogeneous photo/electro-catalysts for generating renewable fuels.

For the use in future lithium air batteries with an aqueous alkaline electrolyte the activity of such electrodes must be improved significantly. As Co3O4 is a promising metal oxide catalyst for oxygen evolution in alkaline media, silver electrodes were modified with Co3O4. For comparison silver electrodes were also modified with IrO2. Due to the poor stability of carbon materials at high anodic potentials these gas diffusion electrodes were prepared without carbon support to improve especially the long-term stability. Gas diffusion electrodes were electrochemically investigated in an electrochemical half-cell arrangement. In addition to cyclic voltammograms electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was carried out. SEM and XRD were used for the physical and morphological investigations. Investigations showed that silver electrodes containing 20 wt.% Co3O4 exhibited the highest performance and highest long-term stability. For comparison, rotating ring disc electrode experiments have been performed using model electrodes with thin catalyst layers, showing that the amount of hydrogen peroxide evolved is negligible.

Alternative pathways to the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) are found, with multiple pathways determined at each step of the four proton-coupled electron transfer reaction. Of particular interest is the detailed characterization of a co-adsorption pathway utilizing neighboring, adsorbed O, OH species in order to evolve oxygen; activation energies of this pathway are <0.5 eV and therefore easily surmountable at the high operating potentials of OER. We also determined that surface Ir atoms can potentially participate in deprotonating an OOH* intermediate; the activation energy to this is 0.67 eV on the oxygen-terminated surface. These theoretical findings explain in part the high activity present in iridium oxide catalysts and also provide insight into the mechanistic pathways available on metal oxide catalysts, which may require the concerted interaction of nearest neighbor co-adsorbates to produce chemicals of interest.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			0013-4651	1945-7111		WOS:000617323800001

In this direction, a wide range of materials have been explored, especially under more favorable alkaline conditions, and several metal chalcogenides have particularly demonstrated excellent performances. However, chalcogenides are thermodynamically less stable than the corresponding oxides and hydroxides under oxidizing potentials in alkaline media. Although this instability in some cases has prevented the application of chalcogenides as oxygen evolution catalysts and it has been disregarded in some others, we propose to use it in our favor to produce high-performance oxygen evolution catalysts. We characterize here the in situ chemical, structural, and morphological transformation during the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in alkaline media of Cu2S into CuO nanowires, mediating the intermediate formation of Cu(OH)(2). We also test their OER activity and stability under OER operation in alkaline media and compare them with the OER performance of Cu(OH)(2) and CuO nanostructures directly grown on the surface of a copper mesh. We demonstrate here that CuO produced from in situ electrochemical oxidation of Cu2S displays an extraordinary electrocatalytic performance toward OER, well above that of CuO and Cu(OH)(2) synthesized without this transformation.									73	4	0	0	3	0	74			0897-4756	1520-5002		WOS:000487859200068

Herein, a covalent organic framework (COF)-derived bifunctional electrocatalyst toward the ORR and the OER is demonstrated, in which the COF-derived carbon on carbon nanotubes is used as the support to anchor active bimetal Ni/Fe clusters and nanoparticles. Since Ni/Fe ions are immobilized in the pore channels of the COFs, the aggregation and migration of ions under pyrolysis are effectively hindered. In addition, the COF-derived carbon-made catalyst features abundant nitrogen content and a high mesoporous volume. As a result, the catalyst displays ultrahigh ORR activity, with a half-wave potential of 0.87 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode in 0.1 m KOH electrolyte. Moreover, the catalyst achieves a low operating potential of 1.55 V at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2), with a Tafel slop of 61 mV decade(-1) for OER in 0.1 m KOH, superior to most oxygen electrocatalysts. Furthermore, the catalyst also exhibits remarkable performance in Zn-air batteries. This work demonstrates a new insight into developing bifunctional catalysts from COFs.									18	1	0	0	2	0	18			2366-7486			WOS:000538618300001

Pt or PtNi nanoparticles were anchored on each support, creating a set of nine samples that were tested for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). PtNi/Mn2O3-NiO showed the most promising results for ORR as evidenced by the lowest Tafel slope, the highest diffusion-limited current density and number of electrons exchanged, along with the highest stability. The best performance of PtNi/Mn2O3-NiO reflects its highest electrochemical surface area and the lowest charge-transfer resistance. Furthermore, this catalyst showed high activity for the OER as evidenced by the low Tafel slope and high current density at an overpotential of 400 mV. The present study indicated different active sites for the two reactions, i.e., PtNi NPs for the ORR and NiO for the OER.									8	0	0	0	0	0	8			1388-2481	1873-1902		WOS:000633165300005

Herein we present a family of triple-perovskite oxygen evolution electrocatalysts with a general formula of Ba3M'M '' O-2(9), where the face-shared, doubly linked M '' O-2(9) octahedral subunits are alternatively connected to the single M'O-6 octahedra in a cornershared mode (M' = Ti, In, or Zn; M ''(2) = IrIr, IrTi, IrRu, or RuRu). Our experimental and theoretical results reveal that the face-shared Ir2O9 octahedral dimers are the essential subunits to achieve reasonable catalytic activity and stability for OER under acidic conditions, and the M'O-6 octahedra as the auxiliary subunits can regulate the covalency as well as the oxygen p-band structure of the material-the important structural properties relative to the catalytic performances. Our results further identify a particular triple-perovskite Ba3TiIr4O9 as an active low-iridium catalyst for OER in acid, which comprises 47 wt % less iridium than IrO2, while giving 28 times higher catalytic activity.									17	2	0	0	0	0	17			0897-4756	1520-5002		WOS:000535241800025

Herein, a series of novel composite catalysts (TiCP-PCP@Co1-xS) by coupling Co1-xS with porphyrin based porous titanium coordination polymer (TiCP-PCP) was designed and prepared, and was characterized by different spectroscopic techniques. The introduction of TiCP-PCP can significantly increase the number of active sites and tune the electronic structure of Co1-xS to reach affluent surface Co3+ active sites center for boosting OER intrinsic activity. The present study indicates that there is an optimum concentration of TiCP-PCP in the composites to maximize OER performance; the optimized 0.2TiCP-PCP@Co1-xS composite with 20 wt% TiCP-PCP exhibits the best OER activity with a low overpotential of 157 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) and excellent long-term stability in alkaline solution. The OER performance of 0.2TiCP-PCP@Co1-xS outperforms state-of-the-art nonprecious-metal catalysts (i.e. IrO2 and RuO2) and most previous reported cobalt-based catalysts.									33	1	0	0	4	0	33			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000569324500005

However, this technology has always been impeded by the lack of a highly efficient and stable electrocatalyst. Amorphous materials, which possess long-range disorder and only short-range order over a few atoms, are often superior to their crystalline counterparts in electrocatalysis owing to their more active sites, broader chemical composition range, and more structural flexibility. This review first introduces some assessment criteria for the OER and then presents theoretical modeling of the OER mechanisms and the state-of-the-art amorphous transition metal-based OER electrocatalysts, involving oxides, hydroxides, sulfides, phosphides, borides, and their composites, as well as their practical applications in the OER. Finally, recent development, existing challenges, and future perspectives for amorphous transition metal-based OER electrocatalysts are discussed. This paper offers valuable guidance in designing highly efficient and stable amorphous OER electrocatalysts for future energy applications.									12	0	0	0	0	0	12			1614-6832	1614-6840		WOS:000789335100001

There is a constant search for a replacement for Pt/C with better ORR electrocatalytic performance but thus far, most materials show poorer electrocatalytic activity than Pt/C. Herein, we present electrocatalytical studies of platinum (Pt) dichalcogenides as alternative electrocatalyst for ORR. Interestingly, not only have we found that PtTe2 demonstrates similar electrocatalytic performance for ORR but its toxicity is significantly lower than the toxicity of Pt/C. This study shows that layered transition metal dichalcogenide family members have strong application potential not only for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER - proton reduction), but also, unexpectedly, for oxygen reduction reaction. We demonstrate PtTe2 as a safer alternative electrocatalyst material for ORR. These studies can allow better understanding of the electrocatalytic performance and toxicological profiles of Pt dichalcogenides in comparison to Pt/C to aid future mass application and commercialization in clean energy reactions such as ORR.									39	1	0	0	1	0	39			2168-0485			WOS:000434491600029

Formation of an edge-sharing CoO6 octahedral structure nanocluster in the Co-P-i cocatalyst was verified by the Co K-edge XAFS spectra under the photoelectrochemical reaction. The P K-edge XAFS spectrum for the Co-P-i cocatalyst showed a pre-edge peak derived from the hybridization of Co(3d)-O(2p)-P(3p) valence orbitals. Therefore, it was spectroscopically demonstrated that a phosphate species binds to the Co edge of the CoO6 cluster in the Co-P-i cocatalyst. The phosphate species is likely to stabilize the CoO6 cluster for efficient oxygen evolution activity.									18	0	0	0	0	0	18			0366-7022	1348-0715		WOS:000371556600011

The formation of C-12 through the so-called triple-alpha reaction is quite well understood. The next step, the formation of O-16 through the alpha capture reaction C-12(alpha,gamma) O-16 on the other hand, still has an experimental uncertainty of similar to 30%. Direct measurements of the C-12(alpha,gamma)O-16 reaction by detecting either the outgoing gamma radiation in a high acceptance Ge-detector array or the residual O-16 nuclei in a mass spectrometer do not allow for order-of-magnitude improvements. In this contribution, the possibility of using superheated bubble detectors for a measurement of the time-inverse O-16(gamma,alpha) C-12 reaction is being discussed. The first results of a 'proof-of-principle' experiment of the 19 F(gamma,alpha) N-15 reaction are also being presented.					5th Biannual Conference on Nuclear Physics in Astrophysics (NPA)/24th Nuclear Physics Divisional Conference of the European-Physical-Society (EPS)5th Biannual Conference on Nuclear Physics in Astrophysics (NPA)/24th Nuclear Physics Divisional Conference of the European-Physical-Society (EPS)	APR 03-08, 2011APR 03-08, 2011	European Phys Soc (EPS), Nucl Phys Div; Hebrew Univ; Soreq Nucl Res Ctr; Tel Aviv Univ; Weizmann Inst SciEuropean Phys Soc (EPS), Nucl Phys Div; Hebrew Univ; Soreq Nucl Res Ctr; Tel Aviv Univ; Weizmann Inst Sci	Eilat, ISRAELEilat, ISRAEL	2	0	0	0	0	0	2			1742-6588		*****************	WOS:000300434600006

In-depth understanding of the nanoscale catalytic effect at electrode/electrolyte interfaces is of great significance for guiding a design of functionally optimized catalyst. Here, using electrochemical atomic force microscopy, we present the real-time imaging of interfacial evolution on nanostructured Au electrodes in a working battery, revealing that the nanostructure of Au is directly related to the catalytic activity toward oxygen reduction reaction (ORR)/oxygen evolution reaction (OER). In situ views show that nanoporous Au with a size of similar to 14 nm for ligaments and similar to 5 nm for nanopores promote the nucleation and growth of discharge product Li2O2 with large size at a high discharge voltage, yet densely packed Au nanoparticles with a diameter of similar to 15 nm could catalyze Li2O2 to fully decompose via the top-bottom approach at a low charge potential. In addition, the difference in the nucleation potential of Li2O2 on the electrode with hybrid nanostructures could result in an uneven distribution of discharge products, which is alleviated at a large discharge rate and the capacity of the battery is improved significantly. These observations provide deep insights into the mechanisms of Li-O-2 interfacial reaction catalyzed by nanostructured catalysts and strategies for improving Li-O-2 batteries.									21	3	0	0	0	0	22			0002-7863	1520-5126		WOS:000573374400042	32815719

The investigation of kinetic isotope effects has long been established for mechanistic studies of various such reactions. However, so far natural isotope abundance determination of O-2 produced at solid electrode surfaces has not been applied. Here, we demonstrate that such measurements are possible. Moreover, they are experimentally simple and sufficiently accurate to observe significant effects. Our measured kinetic isotope effects depend strongly on the electrode material and on the applied electrode potential. They suggest that in the case of iron oxide as the electrode material, the oxygen evolution reaction occurs via a rate-determining O-O bond formation via nucleophilic water attack on a ferryl unit.									40	3	0	0	4	0	41			2041-1723			WOS:000448940100006	30385759

Electrochemical properties such as discharge capacity and high-rate dischargeability of the positive electrode were generally improved by surface modification. Cyclic voltammetric studies indicated that due to the presence of cobalt coating on the surface of Ni(OH)(2) particles, the electrode exhibited a better reversibility of Ni(OH)(2)/NiOOH redox reaction and the higher oxygen evolution overpotential.

When electric current flows through the closed oxygen cycle, a certain amount of electric energy is converted via electrochemical processes into chemical energy, i.e. the products obtained may interact spontaneously as a result of which the system returns to its initial state. During these spontaneous reactions, the chemical energy is converted into heat. Depending on the type of the reactions involved in oxygen reduction on the negative plate, the closed oxygen cycle may proceed in two different electrochemical systems: (i) oxygen is reduced through electrochemical reactions yielding the electrochemical system PbO2/H2O/O-2//O-2/H2O/Pb, and (ii) oxygen is reduced through chemical reactions forming the electrochemical system PbO2/H2O/O-2//PbSO4/Pb. The energy introduced into the system for activation of the closed oxygen cycle is different for the two electrochemical systems. The quantity of this energy is calculated in the present work using thermodynamic data. During the closed oxygen cycle the electric energy is transformed into chemical energy which, in turn, is converted into heat. Part of this heat causes the cell temperature to increase and another part dissipates into the surrounding air. The amount of the former heat depends on the heat capacity of the battery and is influenced most strongly by the quantity of the electrolyte. It has been established that the rate of oxygen evolution on the positive plate depends strongly on the temperature. When the heat exchange between the battery and the surrounding medium is poor, the reactions of the closed oxygen cycle may enter (through the heat and oxygen flows between the positive and the negative plates) into self-accelerating interrelations, which may lead to thermal runaway. To avoid this, an adequate heat exchange should be maintained between the battery and the surrounding medium, the rate of the oxygen reaction should be kept down and a high heat capacity of the battery and small water loss on its operation should be ensured.

The colloidal crystals were plated with Ni, followed by selective removal of PS microspheres to fabricate inverse opals. With adjustments in relevant processing parameters, we were able to obtain inverse opals in multiple layers with excellent surface uniformities. The inverse opals were used as the electrode material for water electrolysis. Results from current-potential polarizations in 1 M KOH aqueous solution indicated that the catalytic abilities for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) increased with the layers of inverse opals. Estimation of the effective current densities determined that the entire area of the inverse opals was available for electrochemical reactions. In galvanostatic measurements for both OER and HER, the inverse opals demonstrated stable voltage profiles without notable degradations for 120 h. Compared with a planar Ni plate, the inverse opals exhibited a significantly reduced overpotential for the water electrolysis.									41	4	0	0	1	0	41			0013-4651			WOS:000274321900115

The high catalytic activity is intrinsically associated with the presence of Fe in both nanosheets and nanoparticles, which has triggered the occurrence of coordinative effects between Fe-N-C and FeCoNi that are beneficial for HER and OER, as revealed by electrochemical techniques. In an overall water splitting electrolyzer, FeCoNi@FeNC is employed as both the cathode and anode catalysts, achieving 12 mA cm(-2) at 1.63 V for a duration of more than 12 h.									21	0	0	0	1	0	21			0934-0866	1521-4117		WOS:000455414600016

The NiO samples were characterized by X-ray diffraction, transmission electron microscopy, N-2-adsorption, scanning electron microscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. The critical synthesis parameters like hydrothermal reaction temperature, time and molar ratio of precursors were varied using Taguchi experimental method to investigate their effect on morphology and specific surface area of mesoporous NiO samples. The characterization data illustrated the formation of nanoplates, nanorods, and nanoparticles. All the NiO samples exhibited mesoporosity and the specific surface area values in the range of 88-156 m(2)/g. One of the synthesized mesoporous NiO samples, largely constituting of nanoplates and nanorods with high porosity, exhibited a Tafel slope of 62 mV/dec and achieved a current density of 41.6 mA/cm(2) at 1.6 V (vs. RHE).

In this study, we demonstrate that a defect network present within high pure polycrystalline graphite can work as a wonderful matrix of electrocatalysts. The electrodes were prepared simply by drop-casting binder-free catalyst precursor solutions on the graphite surface. The precursor ions can infiltrate into the defect channels up to about 3.6 mm deep. Excellent electrocatalytic activity and robust stability were verified using hydrogen and oxygen evolution reactions with different electrocatalysts. The depth-dependent catalytic activities were measured and the depth-profile analyses were performed. The rigid defect network structure significantly improves structural integrity and robust stability and minimizes the electron transfer barrier. Such sustainable electrocatalysts fixed in a rigid defect network have the potential to provide all the features necessary for industrial applications. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

In this paper, a facile surface modification strategy of nanometerscale iron oxyhydroxide (FeOOH) clusters depositing on the surface of LaNiO3 (LNO) perovskite is reported, and it can obviously promote hydroxyl adsorption and weaken Ni-O bond of LNO. The above relevant evidences are well demonstrated by the experimental results and DFT calculations. The excellent hydroxyl adsorption ability of FeOOH-LaNiO3 (Fe-LNO) can obviously optimize OH" filling barriers to promote lattice oxygen-participated OER (LOER), and the weakened Ni-O bond of LNO perovskite can obviously reduce the reaction barrier of the lattice oxygen participation mechanism (LOM). Based on the above synergistic catalysis effect, the Fe-LNO catalyst exhibits a maximum factor of 5 catalytic activity increases for OER relative to the pristine perovskite and demonstrates the fast reaction kinetics (low Tafel slope of 42 mV dec(-1)) and superior intrinsic activity (TOFs of similar to 40 O2S-1 at 1.60 V vs. RHE).									112	2	0	0	6	0	113				2639-5274		WOS:000547342600001	32728668

Owing to their unique features including tunable porosity, abundant accessible active sites, synthetically controllability, and pre-designed topological structures, COFs have been widely employed in various fields including catalysis, energy storage and conversion, gas adsorption, and optoelectronics. The incorporation of porphyrin (Por-) and phthalocyanine (Pc-) building units into COFs endows COFs with unique structural characteristics, excellent optical and electrical properties. Recent years have witnessed significant pro-gress in reasonable design and construction of Por-and Pc-based COFs for electrocatalytic water splitting, CO2 reduction, and oxygen reduction. Herein, the synthetic strategies of Por-and Pc-based COFs are first summarized, which includes the rational design of building units and linkers, and the reaction types used in constructing Por-and Pc-based COFs. A systematic overview of the application of Por-and Pc-based COFs in the electrocatalytic reactions including CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR), hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), oxygen evolution reaction (OER), and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) are then performed. Lastly, the current challenges and directions to tailor Por-and Pc-based COFs for efficient and stable elec-trocatalysis are presented. (C)& nbsp;2022 Elsevier B.V.

Herein, a molybdenum (Mo) and phosphorous (P) co-doped highly efficient and durable electrocatalyst is grown on nickel foam (P-NiCo2O4/CoMoO4/NF, for simplicity G-3) for hydrogen and oxygen evolution reactions (HER and OER, respectively). The dual doping of Mo and P prompts the formation of nanosheet array structures and modifies the surface electronic states, which subsequently enhance the active sites, facilitate the charge transfer, and accelerate the reaction kinetics. As a result, the G-3 sample requires a low overpotential of 78.7 mV and 248.6 mV to reach a current density of 25 mA cm(-2) for the HER and OER, respectively. Furthermore, a cell voltage of 1.729 V is required at 100 mA cm(-2), and the catalyst demonstrates long-term stability of 54 h for overall water splitting.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			2196-0216			WOS:000634878200001

Nature											10.1038/s41586-022-05296-7				2022-Oct-26	2022	Realizing an efficient electron transfer process in the oxygen evolution reaction by modifying the electronic states around the Fermi level is crucial in developing high-performing and robust electrocatalysts1-3. Typically, electron transfer proceeds solely through either a metal redox chemistry (an adsorbate evolution mechanism (AEM), with metal bands around the Fermi level) or an oxygen redox chemistry (a lattice oxygen oxidation mechanism (LOM), with oxygen bands around the Fermi level), without the concurrent occurrence of both metal and oxygen redox chemistries in the same electron transfer pathway1-15. Here we report an electron transfer mechanism that involves a switchable metal and oxygen redox chemistry in nickel-oxyhydroxide-based materials with light as the trigger. In contrast to the traditional AEM and LOM, the proposed light-triggered coupled oxygen evolution mechanism requires the unit cell to undergo reversible geometric conversion between octahedron (NiO6) and square planar (NiO4) to achieve electronic states (around the Fermi level) with alternative metal and oxygen characters throughout the oxygen evolution process. Utilizing this electron transfer pathway can bypass the potential limiting steps, that is, oxygen-oxygen bonding in AEM and deprotonation in LOM1-5,8. As a result, the electrocatalysts that operate through this route show superior activity compared with previously reported electrocatalysts. Thus, it is expected that the proposed light-triggered coupled oxygen evolution mechanism adds a layer of understanding to the oxygen evolution research scene.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0				1476-4687		MEDLINE:36289339	36289339

Although much progress has been achieved in the development of platinum-based electrocatalysts for ORR and iridium-based electrocatalysts for OER, they are still not yet viable for large-scale commercialization because of the high cost and scanty supply of the noble metals. Here, it is demonstrated that carbon nanodots surface-modified with either phosphorus or amidogen can respectively achieve electrocatalytic activity approaching that of the benchmark Pt/C and IrO2/C catalysts for ORR and OER. Furthermore, phosphorus (amidogen)-modified carbon nanodots with attached Au nanoparticles exhibit superior ORR (OER) activity better than commercial Pt/C (IrO2/C) catalysts as well as excellent electrochemical stability under visible light.									82	6	0	0	8	0	84			1614-6832	1614-6840		WOS:000379306400002

One of these alternative energies was the use of water splitting. Since the oxidation reaction of water suffers from a delayed reaction, it is important to use efficient and low-cost electrocatalysts in the process. In this work we report the synthesis of ZnFe2O4@ZnFe2S4 by the hydrothermal method. Here, we suc-cessfully synthesize the ZnFe2O4@ZnFe2S4 core-shell nanosheet on Ni Foam via a novel and facile process for oxygen evolution reactions (OER). The metal-based electrode made of ZnFe2O4@ZnFe2S4 is efficient for the electrochemical reaction of water oxidation due to its electrical strength and high catalytic activity.

The electrolysis of water using ZnFe2O4@ZnFe2S4/NF a current density of 5 mA cm(-2) can be achieved by cell voltage of 1.45 V (vs. RHE) volts in a solution of 1 M KOH.

However, desirable electronic properties along with chemical stability can be achieved through coupling with various conducting substrates or modification of surface properties. The electrocatalytic activity of g-C3N4 was greatly enhanced by doping of hetero atoms, alloying with conducting substrates, noble metals, and other nanostructures. As such, composites of g-C3N4 have attracted widespread attention due to their great potential in environment and energy sectors as electro and photoelectrocatalysts. The electro catalytic applications are diverse enough to include hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), oxygen evolution reaction (OER), oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), fuel cells, supercapacitors and electro/photoelectrochemical sensors. This review presents the basic aspects of various studies on g-C3N4 composites in electro and photoelectrochemical applications such as energy conversion reactions, storage and sensors along with a discussion of their future prospects.									5	0	0	0	2	0	5			0959-6526	1879-1786		WOS:000721408800006

In this work, we have successfully synthesized a novel heterostructure material of snowflake-like Co3O4 nanomaterials attaching on the tip of CuO nanorod arrays supported on three-dimensional copper foam via facile and effective approach. The obtained Co3O4-CuO NRs/CF has been used as efficient electrocatalyst for accelerating the oxygen evolution reaction in alkaline condition, in which a very low overpotential of 340 mV, which was even lower than that of the benchmark RuO2 catalyst, was required to achieve a current density of 20 mA cm(-2), together with a small Tafel slope value of 73.3 mV dec-1. The unique heterostructure and excellent mesoporous characteristic of the Co3O4-CuO NRs/CF materials were the main reasons for its large electrochemical active surface area. Furthermore, the Co3O4-CuO NRs/CF exhibited a much higher electrocatalytic activity than those of the CuO NRs/CF (384 mV at 20 mA cm(-2), 139.6 mV dec(-1)) and Co3O4/CF (360 mVat 20 mA cm(-2), 95.3 mV dec(-1)), as its courterparts. This deomstrated that formation of hetorostructure between snowflake Co3O4 and CuO NRs resulting in enhancing OER performance. In addition to excellent catalytic activity, this catalyst also showed remarkable stability toward the oxygen evolution reaction for at least 30 h under constant potential of 1.6 V in the alkaline condition. The highly catalytic performance for the OER reaction was ascribed to the merits of a unique heterostructure, 3D nanoarrays feature and the synergistic effect between Co3O4 and CuO.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			1572-6657	1873-2569		WOS:000554922000004

In this work, oxygen vacancy engineered leaf-templated CaTiO3 materials have been synthesized by using NaBH4 as a reductant and the formation of oxygen vacancies was confirmed by using different spectroscopic and morphological techniques. Leaf-templated CaTiO3 with the optimum amount of oxygen vacancies showed improved photocatalytic H-2 evolution and N-2 fixation abilities in comparison to pristine CaTiO3. Density functional theory calculations suggested that the O-vacancies present in the TiO2 plane played a crucial role in enhancing the photocatalytic performance than the O-vacancies present in the CaO plane of CaTiO3. The optimized material showed good structural stability but with a loss in morphological features. It is concluded that the benefits of efficient light absorption by the three-dimensional morphology of leaf-templated semiconductor materials could not be utilized in the studied solid-liquid binary phase reactions. The enhanced photocatalytic performance could solely be attributed to the optimum oxygen vacancy sites, which promote the surface reactions and improve the separation of photogenerated charge carriers. This work is expected to provide a future direction in the smart design of application-oriented three-dimensional photocatalysts and other materials.									38	0	0	0	4	0	38			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000680102700001

However, despite a thermodynamic potential of only 1.23 V required at standard conditions, driving the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) typically requires 1.5-1.8 V resulting in a significant loss. Over the past decade, numerous researchers have begun to re-explore the idea of replacing water oxidation with more kinetically facile oxidation reactions in photoelectrochemical and photocatalytic solar H-2 production systems. Alternate photo-oxidation reactions can be employed as a means of chemical valorization, in addition to providing electrons for H-2 production from water while reducing the losses associated with the OER. In this Perspective, we discuss other possible oxidation reactions, and in particular, we highlight recent progress in the investigation of organic-based photo-oxidation reactions. We focus on oxidation reactions that have potential applications as a form of chemical valorization and that can take place in aqueous solutions to allow concurrent H-2 production via water reduction at a (photo)cathode. A critical assessment and an outlook toward the prospective large-scale implementation of this technology is finally considered.									67	1	0	0	5	0	67			2155-5435			WOS:000460600600039

It provides an effective method for producing high-purity hydrogen as a sustainable energy source. In order to solve the growing energy shortage and environmental damage, the development and synthesis of efficient and inexpensive hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) electrocatalysts is urgently needed. Traditional reaction catalysts such as Pt/Rh/Ir and their oxides (such as IrO2, RuO2) have limited their wide application as electrocatalysts due to their high prices and small reserves. In this work, CoP nanocrystals by phosphating the Co3O4 nanocubes precursor were successfully synthesized. CoP nanocrystals are a new type of non-metallic HER catalyst that can work under alkaline conditions. Its initial potential is only 87 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2), and the Tafel slope is 105 mV dec(-1). The catalyst can maintain the catalytic performance for 12 h in 1M KOH solution, and the performance can still be maintained above 95.44%.									8	0	0	0	0	0	8			0927-7757	1873-4359		WOS:000544065500008

Tremendous efforts have already been invested in the syntheses and applications of metal organic framework-based (MOF) electrocatalysts, due to their fascinating functionalities and diversities. Recent advances demonstrate keen interests and ambitions to achieve bifunctional catalytic activity in MOF-based catalysts, particularly targeting specific energy conversion applications, namely, ORR/OER for metal-air batteries, HER/OER for electrocatalytic water splitting. The unique characteristics of MOFs make it possible to design and grant MOF-based catalysts excellent bifunctional catalytic performance by means of incorporating bimetallic components, associating with non-metallic elements, hosting and exposing bifunctional active sites/species. Herein, this review aims to summarize recent explosive number of researches on MOF-based bifunctional catalysts with particular attention to the origin of bifunctionalities and the fundamental principles in designing bifunctional MOF-based catalysts. Current challenges and future prospects for bifunctional MOF-based catalysts are proposed before the conclusion of this review as well. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

EO water is generated by electrolysis of an extremely dilute NaCl solution. Therefore, it is necessary to enhance the selectivity of chlorine evolution reaction (CER), which the oxygen evolution side reaction (OER) needs to be minimized. In the present study, the TiO2 doped IrO2-Ta2O5 (IrO2-Ta2O5-TiO2) electrode was prepared by the thermal decomposition method. X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and X-ray fluorescence (XRF) characterizations were employed to study the performances the IrO2-Ta2O5-TiO2 electrode. The electrochemical behaviors and actives of the IrO2-Ta2O5-TiO2 electrode coupled with the IrO2-Ta2O5 electrode was investigated using cyclic voltammetry (CV) and linear sweep voltammetry (LSV). Furthermore, the selectivity of CER was analyzed through the potential difference between the CER and OER at a constant current density to illustrate the discrepancy in available chlorine content (ACC) of two kinds of oxide electrodes in the EO water preparation. In addition, the accelerated service lifetime of the IrO2-Ta2O5-TiO2 electrode was also discussed in this article.									11	0	0	0	1	0	11			1572-6657	1873-2569		WOS:000456759300057

The incorporation of iron reduced the overpotential required for oxygen evolution by as much as 300 mV at a current density of 100 mA/cm(2)-compared to undoped nickel oxide deposited under similar conditions. Tafel slopes were reduced from 95 mV/dec in undoped NiOx films to less than 40 mV/dec for films containing 1.6 to 5.6 mole percent (m/o) iron, indicating a change in the rate-limiting step from the primary discharge of OH- ions to the recombination of oxygen radicals. Resistivity, structural, and compositional measurements indicate that high oxygen content is necessary to gain the full benefit of the iron dopant. Initial tests in KOH indicate excellent long-term stability. A film deposited from the FeNi alloy target, which exhibited low oxygen overpotentials and a Tafel slope of 35 mV/dec, had not degraded appreciably following more than 7000 h of operation at an anodic current density of 20 mA/cm(2). Taken together, the low oxygen evolution reaction overpotentials, the excellent stability in KOH, and the relative insensitivity to iron content indicate that reactively sputtered iron-doped nickel oxide is promising as an oxygen catalyst.									183	12	0	0	11	0	188			0013-4651			WOS:A1997XY20000035

Moreover, the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) properties for the MnO2 nanoarrays were studied. The results showed that the performance of alpha-MnO2 nanowires outperformed delta-MnO2 nanosheets in alkaline medium and the overpotential of alpha-MnO2 was 444 mV under 10 mA.cm(-2) current density (the overpotential of delta-MnO2 was 522 mV). According to the analysis of X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, the higher content of Mn3+ and more abundant oxygen vacancies on the surface are the reasons for the higher catalytic activity of alpha-MnO2 nanowires.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1001-4861			WOS:000792139200016

With similar to 8.0 wt % of metal in the composite catalyst, efficient catalysis toward the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) can be achieved with a pseudo-four-electron transfer per oxygen molecule, outperforming the benchmark catalyst, Pt/C, by a more positive onset potential, and smaller half-wave potential and Tafel slope. A rechargeable battery stack built from five zinc-air cells in series gives a power output of up to 28.5 W. Benefiting from its low internal resistance, the battery stack can deliver a high current of 8.4 A and a stable discharge voltage above 5.5 V over 180 cycles, showing potential as a basic unit for grid-scale energy storage.									33	2	0	0	3	0	33			2168-0485			WOS:000434491600061

However, the lack of high performance and inexpensive electrocatalysts for kinetically sluggish oxygen evolution reaction (OER) hinder the practical application. Here, the noteworthy enhancement of electrodeposited cobalt boride (CoB) nanosheets from the combined effect of using gadolinium as a dopant and thin film of gold as prudent support is demonstrated. The free-standing Gd-CoB@Au exhibits remarkable electrochemical performance, high intrinsic activity, and lower reaction resistance, which are confirmed by lower onset potential, small charge transfer resistance, lower Tafel slope value, and high turnover frequency. Furthermore, the post-OER characterization signpost, no observable change in the chemical structure or morphology of nanosheets during the long-lasting oxidation process. Because of the inexpensive, facile, and scalable one-step preparation processes, the catalyst is highly encouraging for large-scale practical applications.									34	0	0	0	1	0	34			1616-301X	1616-3028		WOS:000515669900001

Herein, RhCu nanotubes (NTs) with rich structural defects are successfully synthesized by a mixed-solvent strategy, which display superior activity and excellent stability for both the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction in all pH values. In particular, it only needs 8, 12, and 57 mV to deliver the current density of 10 mA cm(-2) for HER in alkaline, acidic, and neutral conditions, respectively. Experiments combined with density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that the exposure of a suitable composition of a highly active Rh3Cu1 alloy phase through acid etching is the key to improve electrocatalytic performance, since it weakens the adsorption free energy of atomic oxygen and hydrogen, as well as facilitating the dissociation of water molecules. In addition, the structural defects can also boost the catalytic performance because the adsorption of reactants can be largely enhanced. The results provide a simple method to prepare alloy NTs as highly efficient electrocatalysts for overall water splitting in all pH values.									56	4	0	0	3	0	56			1614-6832	1614-6840		WOS:000510053000001

In this paper, a set of epitaxial rare-earth nickelates (RNiO3) thin films is investigated with controlled A-site isovalent substitution to correlate their structure and physical properties with ORR/OER activities, examined by using a three-electrode system in O-2-saturated 0.1 m KOH electrolyte. The ORR activity decreases monotonically with decreasing the A-site element ionic radius which lowers the conductivity of RNiO3 (R = La, La0.5Nd0.5, La0.2Nd0.8, Nd, Nd0.5Sm0.5, Sm, and Gd) films, with LaNiO3 being the most conductive and active. On the other hand, the OER activity initially increases upon substituting La with Nd and is maximal at La0.2Nd0.8NiO3. Moreover, the OER activity remains comparable within error through Sm-doped NdNiO3. Beyond that, the activity cannot be measured due to the potential voltage drop across the film. The improved OER activity is ascribed to the partial reduction of Ni3+ to Ni2+ as a result of oxygen vacancies, which increases the average occupancy of the e(g) antibonding orbital to more than one. The work highlights the importance of tuning A-site elements as an effective strategy for balancing ORR and OER activities of bifunctional electrocatalysts.									81	4	0	0	8	0	82			1616-301X	1616-3028		WOS:000445327300023

A DFT-based investigation								COMPUTATIONAL MATERIALS SCIENCE				169						109110	10.1016/j.commatsci.2019.109110				NOV 2019	2019	Iron oxyhydroxides (FeOOH) are the general form of iron element existing on the earth that has many applications, including organic pollutant degradation, water treatment, solar cell, photocatalysis and so on. Recent research found that FeOOH exhibits remarkable oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activities in photocatalysis, which indicate that FeOOH could be a suitable candidate for overall water splitting reaction. However, the theoretical understanding of different phases iron oxyhydroxides are still insufficient. In this work, we apply the ab initio calculations based on density functional theory (DFT + U and HSE06) to goethite (alpha-FeOOH), akaganeite (beta-FeOOH) and lepidocrocite (gamma-FeOOH) with an aim to select the promising photocatalyst for overall water splitting reactions. The results of surface energy manifest that akaganeite is more accessible for crystal engineering. Moreover, the band edge calculation shows the valence band maximum (VBM) and conduction band minimum (CBM) of akaganeite can both satisfy the requirements of hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution OER at the same time.									19	1	0	0	2	0	19			0927-0256	1879-0801		WOS:000483683900060

Such activation was either spontaneous (in situ: slow surface modification upon OER operation), or accelerated (ex situ, by alternating potential steps at low/high potential). Both techniques enable formation of a catalytic surface from the SS bulk components in experimental conditions close to those of usage, which guarantees long-term-stability and high-activity of the surfaces. Ex situ activated electrodes show comparable performances than in situ-activated electrodes, the resulting OER activities in KOH electrolytes being high compared to other noble-metal-free electrocatalysts. Activated 316 L electrodes are remarkably stable in long-term OER operation ( > 300 h). Therefore, cheap and widely-available activated SS may be very competitive OER materials for alkaline water electrolyzers. These results open the way to the development of highly-active and low-cost OER materials for hydrogen production, or metal-air batteries.									29	1	0	0	1	0	29			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000487570000017

Rational fabrication of effective oxygen electrocatalysts is crucial for the development of oxygen related energy devices, such as fuel cells and rechargeable metal-air batteries. Recently, owing to their tunable compositions and microstructures, metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) based materials have drawn extensive attention as nonprecious oxygen electrocatalysts. Various strategies have been developed to fabricate MOF-based electrocatalysts and regulate their active sites, such as heterometal doping, defect engineering, morphology tuning, heterostructure construction, and hybridization. In this review, by focusing on various modulation strategies aiming at active sites, the recent advances of MOF-based electrocatalysts are summarized. The synthetic methods used to synthesize various MOF-based oxygen electrocatalysts are discussed, followed by the underlying engineering mechanisms required to allow performance enhancement, and finally some existing challenges that hinder for their practical applications are discussed alongside a perspective on their possible future.									44	0	0	0	1	0	44			1614-6832	1614-6840		WOS:000627075300001

The as obtained materials were further sintered at 450 degrees C in air and then utilized for physicochemical and electrochemical characterizations. X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns showing sharp peaks confirmed the formation of single phase cubic spinel structure. TEM image reveals the formation of nanocrystalline particles having size in range of 10-20 nm. Further, the electrocatalytic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) of as-synthesized materials was studied by linear sweep voltammetry in alkaline solution. The OER results showed that co-substitution of Cr in NiFe2O4 matrix improved the electrocatalytic activity of the oxides towards OER. The NiCr0.5Fe1.5O4 shows the best OER performance in 1.0 M KOH solution. It achieved a low overpotential of about 320 mV at 10 mA/cm(2) current density, which is comparable to other reported electrocatalysts. Tafel parameters and order of reaction were also in close agreements with literature values.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			1984-6428			WOS:000579752900007

Much research on oxidation rates of various graphite grades under a number of conditions has been undertaken to address such an event. However, consequences to the reactor result from the microstructural changes to the graphite rather than directly from oxidation. The microstructure is inherent to a graphite's properties and ultimately degradation to the graphite's performance must be determined to establish the safety of reactor design. To understand the oxidation induced microstructural change and its corresponding impact on performance, a thorough understanding of the reaction system is needed. This article provides a thorough review of the graphite-molecular oxygen reaction in terms of kinetics, mass and energy transport, and structural evolution: all three play a significant role in the observed rate of graphite oxidation. These provide the foundations of a microstructurally informed model for the graphite-molecular oxygen reaction system, a model kinetically independent of graphite grade, and capable of describing both the observed and local oxidation rates under a wide range of conditions applicable to air-ingress.

In addition, the impact of incorporating foreign metals in these layers on the electrochemical performance will be highlighted.Using EQCM much information can be obtained, as both the electrochemical response and accompanying mass changes can be measured simultaneously. EQCM was extensively used to investigate the effect of the conditions on the formation of Ni(OH)(2) thin layers, the alpha-to-beta modification changes and the details of the redox mechanism. The proposed redox mechanisms differ in whether H+ or OH- is transferred, the reactants and/or products are hydrated and cations from the solution take part in the reaction.By incorporation of other metals in the structure, the characteristics of thin Ni(OH)(2) layers can be tuned. This affects the oxidation and reduction potential, the reversibility, the stability of the structure and the oxygen evolution side reaction. Co2+ and Fe2+ were shown to replace Ni-sites in the hydrous oxide lattice, thereby forming very dense structures with higher stability. However, structural changes still occur in most cases. Due to this inhomogeneity, the layers are usually a combination of different structures, depending on the distribution of the incorporated metal(s). Suppression of the oxygen evolution reaction is reported for Co, Pb, Pd, Zn and Mn. The effects of Co and Mn are shown to depend on the incorporated amount. Co shifts the standard redox potential for the oxygen evolution reaction towards more cathodic potentials and decreases the oxygen overpotential significantly. Light-weight rare-earth elements also catalyze the oxygen evolution reaction. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.									171	3	0	0	9	1	171			0013-4686	1873-3859		WOS:000237647300001

Herein, we report a ball-milling induced defect assisted with ZnCl2 strategy for fabricating defect-rich iron/nitrogen co-doped graphene-based materials (Fe-N-G). The substantial mechanical shear forces and the constant corrosion to the carbon matrix by ZnCl2 lead to the creation of abundant defects in graphene-based materials, which facilitates doping for heteroatoms. The defect-rich Fe-N-G catalyst with abundant Fe-N-x active sites displays excellent ORR performance. For OER, the over potential for Fe-N-G outperforms that of RuO2 in 1 M KOH at 10 mA cm(-2). The Density Functional Theory calculations unravel that the impressive OER performance is attributable to the introduction of abundant defects. Additionally, the liquid and all-solid-state zinc-air batteries equipped with the prepared material as the air cathode demonstrate high power density, high specific capacity, and long charge-discharge stability. This work offers a practical method for manufacturing high-performance electrocatalysts for environmental and energy-related fields. (C) 2021 Elsevier Inc.

Electrocatalysts for water splitting must have active catalytic performance as well as high stability in strong alkaline or acidic media to be used in commercial elecrolyzer. Transition metal based electrocatalysts are considered as highly promising candidates due to their excellent oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) performance and stability with low materials cost. Recently, binder free self-supported electrocatalysts based on transition metals have emerged as state-of-the-art catalytic electrodes due to their high activity and robustness. These properties are attributed to lack of catalyst powder aggregation and a strong synergetic effect between the electrode surface and catalyst. In this mini review, recent development in self-supported electrocatalysts for OER, HER and also bifunctional OER & HER are reviewed in terms of superior activity and robust stability. Material design strategies, structural and compositional properties, and catalytic performance of recently reported self-supported electrocatalysts are summarized. Finally, overview of recent studies, challenges and prospects related to self-supported electrocatalysts are discussed.									29	2	0	0	2	0	29			1867-3880	1867-3899		WOS:000517212500007

In this work, a non-precious composite (i.e., Ba0.5Sr0.5Co0.8Fe0.2O3-delta (BSCF), g-C3N4 and Vulcan carbon (VC)) labeled as BSCF/g-C3N4-VC was developed via ultrasonically mixing. The formed BSCF/g-C3N4-VC exhibited improved ORR and OER activity compared with the individual g-C3N4 and BSCF, as well as the composites of g-C3N4-VC and BSCF/VC. The critical roles of BSCF, g-C3N4, and VC for boosting ORR and OER have been clearly demonstrated. Apparently, the prepared composite overcame major limitations of perovskite-type BSCF and g-C3N4, i.e., the relatively low specific surface area (similar to 0.27 m(2) g(-1)) of the former and the extremely low electronic conductivity of the latter. Moreover, the significantly enhanced electrocatalytic activity could be attributed to the synergistic effect between g-C3N4, BSCF, and VC. Our results suggest that facilely compositing carbon materials (e.g. VC and g-C3N4) with perovskite-type oxides (e.g. BSCF) will open a new path for the development of highly efficient oxygen electrocatalysts.									10	1	0	0	0	0	10			0022-4596	1095-726X		WOS:000508288400028

Herein, composites composed of Co and carbon nanotubes (Co NPs@CNT) are fabricated by one-step chemical vapor deposition (CVD) using commercial Co nanoparticles and benzene as precursors. In the alkaline medium, Co NPs@CNT exhibits a small overpotential of 380 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2), small Tafel slope of 82.2 mV dec(-1), and excellent structural and electrochemical durability and the properties are better than those of most previously reported Co-based electrocatalysts and commercial Co nanoparticles. The CNTs not only provide high conductivity, but also decrease the adsorption energy of OH* on the surface of Co NPs@CNT. The small energy barrier is responsible for the enhanced OER performance of Co NPs@CNT. In addition to the revelation of the synergistic effects between Co and CNTs, our results provide insights into the development of metal-carbon electrocatalysts and the simple and effective strategy described here has large commercial potential.									24	0	0	0	1	0	24			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000520021200126

However, most studied oxygen vacancies are unstable and susceptible under the oxygen circumstance. Here, we fabricated cobalt-defected Co3-xO4 in situ for an efficient oxygen evolution reaction (OER). XAFS and PALS characterizations show that the crystals have abundant Co vacancies and a distorted structure. DFT calculations indicate that the metal defects lead to obvious electronic delocalization, which enhances the carrier transport to participate in water-splitting reactions along the defective conducting channels and the water adsorption/activation on the catalyst surface. Therefore, cobalt-defected Co-3-xO(4) shows remarkably high OER activity by delivering a much lower overpotential of 268 mV@ 10 mA cm(-2) (with a small Tafel slope of 38.2 mV/dec) for OER in KOH electrolyte, in comparison with normal Co3O4 (376 mV), IrO2 (340 mV), and RuO2 (276 mV). This work opens up a promising approach to construct electronic delocalization structures in metal oxides for high-performance electrochemical catalysts.									283	22	0	0	13	0	285			2155-5435			WOS:000431727300009

Significantly low overpotentials are required for Ru/N-BP2000 to catalyze HER (15 mV vs. RHE) and OER (285 mV vs. RHE) in 1 M KOH with current density of 10 mA cm(-2), which outperforms Ru/BP2000 (HER: 54.2 mV vs. RHE; OER: 337 mV vs. RHE) as well as the benchmark Pt/C (52 mV vs. RHE) and IrO2 (301 mV vs. RHE). Moreover, ignorable losses in electrocatalytic activities toward HER and OER are recorded for Ru/N-BP2000 electrocatalyst ascribed to the electronically delocalized Ru atoms induced by the nitrogen atoms. Only 1.53 V is needed for Ru/N-BP2000 electrocatalyst to drive overall water splitting with stable current density of 10 mA cm(-2) for 50 h, which is comparably lower than Pt/C-IrO2 demanding 1.59 V to attain 10 mA cm(-2).

Although significant progresses have been realized in the development of various composite modulation to improve their properties for oxygen evolution, to boost their poor catalytic activity for oxygen evolution reaction is still challenging, which unambiguously limits the wide utilization of cobalt sulfides. Here, we present the facile growth of metal-doping (Fe, Ni) into Co9S8 supported on nickle foam (NF) through a one-step simple hydrothermal process. The effect of (Fe, Ni)-doping on the morphology and the catalytic activity of Co9S8 has been thoroughly investigated. Fe-Co(9)S(8 )nano-microspheres supported on NF (Fe-Co9S8 NM/NF) have been obtained with the remarkable electrocatalytic activity, which only requires a lower overpotential of 270 mV to reach a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) and exhibits the smaller Tafel slope of 70 mV dec(-1) as well as robust stability. The excellent OER performance of FeCo9S8 NM/NF could be attributed to the synergistic interaction of Fe dopants withCo(9)S(8) nano-microspheres and faster charge transfer rate derived from NF support. This work provides a new and effective way to design metal-doped Co9S8-based heterostructures supported on conducive support as efficient OER electrocatalysts.									64	3	0	0	2	0	64			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000436944500005

Herein, we introduce a low-cost conducting polymer material polyaniline (PANI) as a solid-state redox mediator for decoupling the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in acidic media. It allows these two half-reactions to be separated from each other in time during the electrolysis of water. As an intermediary material for charge storage, the PANI electrode exhibits a remarkable reversible discharge capacity of 125 mA h g(-1) at a current density of 0.2 A g(-1). Moreover, an approach by controlling the equilibrium potential of the PANI electrode is developed to balance the separate cell voltages. In this way, the decoupled HER and OER can be sequentially driven at close cell voltages of only 0.8 V. Considering the low cost of PANI and its excellent electrochemical performance, this study paves the way for the practical application of this state-of-the-art decoupling strategy.									23	2	0	0	1	0	23			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000471010900021

In this work, we investigate the stability of both the metal atoms and, by quantitative and highly sensitive O-18 isotope labelling experiments, the oxygen atoms in a series of RuOx and IrOx electrocatalysts during the OER in the mechanistically interesting low overpotential regime. We show that materials based on RuOx have a higher dissolution rate than the rate of incorporation of labelled oxygen from the catalyst into the O-2 evolved ("labelled OER"), while for IrOx-based catalysts the two rates are comparable. On amorphous RuOx, metal dissolution and labelled OER are found to have distinct Tafel slopes. These observations together lead us to a full mechanistic picture in which dissolution and labelled OER are side processes to the main electrocatalytic cycle. We emphasize the importance of quantitative analysis and point out that since less than 0.2% of evolved oxygen contains an oxygen atom originating from the catalyst itself, lattice oxygen evolution is at most a negligible contribution to overall OER activity for RuOx and IrOx in acidic electrolyte.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			1754-5692	1754-5706		WOS:000776271300001	35706421

Herein, representative progress achieved in MXenes as hydrogen evolution reaction electrocatalysts is reviewed both experimentally and theoretically. Briefly, termination modification and heteroatom incorporation are applied to optimize the chemical and electronic configurations of active sites for intrinsically enhanced catalytic kinetics while various nanostructures and hybridizations are fabricated to increase the density and accessibility of active sites. Then, the achievements of MXene-based catalysts in other electrocatalysis processes are also summarized, including the oxygen evolution/reduction reaction, carbon dioxide reduction reaction and nitrogen reduction reaction.

However, both reactions are severely restricted by their sluggish kinetics, thus requiring highly active, cost-effective, and durable electrocatalysts. Herein, we develop novel bifunctional nanocatalysts through surface nanoengineering of dealloying-driven nanoporous gold (NPG). Pd overlayers were precisely deposited onto the NPG ligament surface by epitaxial layer-by-layer growth. More importantly, the obtained NPG-Pd overlayer nanocatalysts exhibit remarkably enhanced electrocatalytic activities toward both the ORR and OER in alkaline media, benchmarked against a stateof- the-art Pt/C catalyst. The improved electrocatalytic performance is rationalized by the unique three-dimensional nanoarchitecture of NPG, enhanced Pd utilization efficiency from precise control of the Pd overlayers, and change in electronic structure, as revealed by density functional theory calculations.									32	6	0	0	0	0	32			1998-0124	1998-0000		WOS:000388114400018

The viability of the technology depends on the availability of low-cost alternatives to the platinum group metals (PGMs); which are the best known electrocatalysts for both the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). In this study, borate doping of nickel sulfide was found to yield catalysts which are effective for total water electrolysis. For the borate-doped nickel sulfides ((BO3)(x)-Ni3S4, x=0, 0.57, 0.78 and 1.08), the strong affinity of borate for hydroxyl groups facilitates the dissociation of adsorbed water molecules to oxygen. Consequently, the borate-doped nickel sulfide catalyst with the best performance in this study, (BO3)(1.08)-Ni3S4, requires only a small overpotential of 306 mV to support a current density of 10 mAcm(-2) in OER. This, together with a small Tafel slope of 36.5 mVdecade(-1) and a stable extended operation; places (BO3)(1.08)-Ni3S4 among the top non-PGM OER electrocatalysts reported to date. At the same time (BO3)(1.08)-Ni3S4 also shows good HER activity and stability for it to be used as a standalone catalyst for efficient total water splitting in alkaline electrolyte (1.69 V at 10 mAcm(-2)).									15	0	0	0	0	0	15			2196-0216			WOS:000462598900023

From transmission and scanning electron microscopy analyses, it was observed that the layered two-dimensional VS2 nanoparticles successfully grew over the layered graphene matrix. The as-synthesized NComp displayed excellent electrocatalytic activities towards ORR with a four-electron transfer pathway, and OER in alkaline medium. The synthesized nanocatalyst exhibits lower Delta E value (0.75 V) as compared to other literature values, high catalytic current density (-6.26 mA cm(-2) for ORR) with a lower Tafel slope (59 mV dec(-1)), as compared to Pt/C, and lower overpotential (eta=0.31 V at 10 mA cm(-2) for OER) with a smaller Tafel slope (68 mV dec(-1)) than those of RuO2. Moreover, it displays high electrochemically active surface area, long-term stability in alkaline medium and good resistance to the methanol crossover effect. The enhanced bifunctional electrocatalytic properties of the synthesized nanocatalyst may be owing to the synergistic effect of combining VS2 and rGO, which improves the surface area, adsorption of reaction intermediates, active sites density, and electrical conductivity. Along with the high stability of the hybrid NComp, these advantages provide immense promise for triggering breakthroughs in fuel-cell electrocatalysis.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2196-0216			WOS:000835489400001

We focus on water splitting by metal-oxide semiconductors and discuss topics such as theoretical calculations of light absorption, band gap/band edge, charge transport, and electrochemical reactions at the electrode-electrolyte interface. In particular, we review the mechanisms of the oxygen evolution reaction, strategies to lower overpotential, and computational methods applied to PEC systems with particular focus on multiscale modeling. The current challenges in modeling PEC interfaces and their processes are summarized. At the end, we propose a new multiscale modeling approach to simulate the PEC interface under conditions most similar to those of experiments. This approach will contribute to identifying the limitations at PEC interfaces. Its generic nature allows its application to a number of electrochemical systems.									69	1	0	0	10	0	69			1864-5631	1864-564X		WOS:000378633800001	27219662

Despite the many benefits of nanostructured catalysts, their use in practical systems has not yet been fully realized due to their many technical challenges. A great deal of effort has been made to overcome the hurdles of nanomaterials, but we postulate that the solution to these problems may not necessarily result from technology based on nanomaterials. In this work, we demonstrate this by demonstrating a new thermal route that can produce an electrocatalytically active material for the oxygen evolution reaction from its bulk form that has a very low catalytic activity. In our synthesis protocol, the oxidation and subsequent sulfidation of bulk cobalt sulfide (CoSx) are delicately exploited so that its composition and porous structure are manipulated to make bulk CoSx as active as the state-of-the-art IrO2 catalyst. Given the simplicity and mass productivity, this re-engineering strategy based on sulfur/oxygen exchange reactions will pave a new avenue for designing cost-effective, active electrocatalysts. We also anticipate this method to provide an opportunity to reassess the potential of bulk materials for electrocatalysis.									15	1	0	0	1	0	15			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000530495500010

Here, 3D hierarchical porous graphene (hpG)-based materials with micro-, meso-, and macroporous features have recently attracted extensive research efforts due to unique porosities, controllable synthesis, versatile functionalization, favorable mass/electron transport, and superior performances in which corresponding electrochemical performances are strongly dependent on the nature of the building blocks and structural hierarchy of the assemblies.

Furthermore, applications of 3D hpG materials in various electrochemical energy storage and conversion systems will be summarized, including lithium-ion batteries, lithium-sulfur batteries, lithium metal anodes, oxygen reduction reaction, oxygen evolution reaction, hydrogen evolution reaction, and nitrogen reduction reaction. Overall, this review will comprehensively present the property advantages, design principles and synthesis strategies of 3D hpG-based energy materials and provide guidance in the development of various 2D graphene-analogous materials and nanomaterials for advanced electrochemical energy storage and conversion systems.Graphical Abstract									61	10	0	0	2	0	61			2520-8489	2520-8136		WOS:000606752000006		
J	Pak, Chanho; Lee, Seung Woo; Baik, Chaekyung; Lee, Bong Ho; You, Dae Jong; You, Eunyoung								New strategy for reversal tolerant anode for automotive polymer electrolyte fuel cell								CHINESE CHEMICAL LETTERS				30	6			1186	1189		10.1016/j.cclet.2019.02.020				JUN 2019	2019	Since the commercialization of the fuel cell electric vehicles (FCEVs), the polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cell system has been actively improved as a powertrain for ultimate environment-friendly vehicle. During the FCEV operation, various transient conditions such as start-up/shut-down and fuel starvation occur irregularly, which deteriorates the durability of the membrane electrode assembly. In particular, when fuel starvation occurs, the carbon support in the anode is oxidized within few minutes, thus the mitigation of this phenomenon is essential for securing the durability. This short review introduces the concept of reversal tolerant anode (RTA), which is a mitigation method using an oxygen evolution catalyst and reviews some previous reports. In addition, new approach for RTA suggested by authors recently, which is the replacement of Pt anode catalyst by multifunctional IrRu alloy catalyst that simultaneously exhibits the activities for the hydrogen oxidation reaction and the oxygen evolution reaction is introduced.

Recently, many upscaling synthesis strategies for the development of a variety of respectable control atomically precise heterogeneous catalysts are reported and explored for various important applications in catalysis for energy and environmental remediation. Precise atomic-scale control of catalysts has allowed to significantly increase activity, selectivity, and in some cases stability. This approach has proved to be relevant in various energy and environmental related technologies such as fuel cell, chemical reactors for organic synthesis, and environmental remediation. Therefore, this review aims to critically analyze the recent progress on single-atom catalysts (SACs) application in oxygen reduction reaction, oxygen evolution reaction, hydrogen evolution reaction, and chemical and/or electrochemical organic transformations.

In this work, we report a series of novel nanocomposites comprising CeO2 nanorods decorated with CoSe2 nanoparticles. The nanocomposites were prepared via a conventional hydrothermal synthesis or a rapid electrodeposition process, and their structure, morphology, and electrochemical performance toward OER in alkaline solution were compared. To tune the electrocatalytic activity, the mass ratio of CoSe2 to CeO2 was systematically varied. Compared with the hydrothermal synthesis, the much faster electrodeposition method yielded a nanocomposite with a similar or slightly better performance in OER. This nanocomposite exhibited an overpotential of 290 mV (at 10 mA cm(-2) current density), a Tafel slope of 53 mV dec(-1), and excellent electrochemical stability for 15 h. Overall, these findings demonstrate the great potential of CoSe2/CeO2 nanocomposites as effective OER electrocatalysts for future applications. (C) 2022 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC.

However, to date, the electrochemical activities of these electrocatalysts are mainly attributed to different active dopants (e.g. N, B, P or S), leading to a common concept that heteroatom doping is essential for carbon-based electrocatalysts. Recently, we presented a new concept where the specific topological defects could activate the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and developed a facile method to create such unique defects. Subsequent research has extended this new mechanism to other reactions, such as the hydrogen and oxygen evolution reactions (HER and OER) and confirmed that heteroatom doping is not essential but that these defects can serve as actives sites for electrochemical reactions. This new theory then creates a new research direction in electrocatalysis. In this short review, we summarise the origin and presentation of the defect mechanism concept, the possible topological defect structures that are effective for electrochemical reactions, the formation of desirable defects, the challenges in the synthesis and characterization of typical defects and future research directions on the electrochemical defect mechanism.									83	13	0	0	7	0	84				2052-1537		WOS:000436821100001

In this study, we synthesize spinel-type MnCo2O4 (MCO) nanoparticles on highly graphitized platelet-type carbon nanofibers (pCNF) via a solvothermal method. The pCNF is selected as carbon support in this study because of the excellent stability against anodic degradation under the OER condition. The MCO nanoparticles of 2-5 nm in diameter are uniformly dispersed on pCNF and the catalyst exhibits high activities for ORR due to strong interaction pCNF and MCO, in addition to the improvement of OER activities.

Here, we propose a multielements composition-engineering approach to construct phosphorous (P) doped cobalt iron sulfide (CoFeS) hybrids for efficient water electrocatalysis. Through the combination of Co and P co-doping, nanostructuring, and hybridization with carbon nanotubes (CNTs), we demonstrate that the designed CoFeSP/CNT with optimum composition is superior bifunctional electrocatalyst for both hydrogen and oxygen evolution reaction (HER and OER). When employed as a hydrogen-evolution electrode, the assynthesized CoFeSP/CNT are found to be stable and active in both acid and alkaline electrolytes. When used as an oxygen-evolution electrode, the in-situ electrochemical generated CoFe-oxyhydroxides exhibits excellent performance where low overpotentials of 262 and 309 mV achieved at a current density of 10 and 100 mA cm(-2), respectively. Moreover, a two-electrode alkaline water electrolyzer constructed with three dimensional CoFeSP nanorods on carbon cloth (CoFeSP/CC) can afford a current density of 50 mA cm(-2) at a voltage of 1.62 V.

It is pointed out that although a modest electron transfer in an alloy enhances the reactions synergistically, too large a charge transfer binds surface species adsorbed from the electrolyte too tightly to allow the reactants access to the electrode surface. This latter phenomenon is demonstrated on a Ni-Ti electrode, which is inactive for all three fuel cell reactions. However, Ni-Ti is stable in acid and gives normal electrolytic reactions, but with onset potentials and exchange-current densities lowered or raised in predictable directions. Chronopotentiograms for oxygen evolution and methanol oxidation reactions on 75-25 Pt-Ru electrodes are interpreted; they support the prediction that charge transfer enhances the adsorption of oxygen species from the electrolyte to the surface, which is the rate-limiting step in methanol oxidation.									119	4	0	0	1	1	119			0897-4756	1520-5002		WOS:000677542600003

As a vital rare-earth oxide, CeO2 has shown great promise in catalysis for its feasible redox feature, high oxygen storage capacity, abundant surface oxygen defects, and structural robustness. The structural characteristics will boost the electrocatalytic activity and durability of CeO2-based hybrids. In this Review, relevant research results focusing on recent hybrid materials between CeO2 and other functional species, including metal, metal oxides/hydroxides, metal sulfides and phosphides, towards the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), and nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR) are summarized. This Review also highlights the key role of CeO2 and the structural design strategies in the hybrid electrocatalysts, including ion doping, interface and defect engineering, electronic structure optimization, and morphology control for catalytic output enhancement. Lastly, some scientific challenges and perspectives have been proposed, aiming to promote the development of other CeO2-based hybrids for energy related electrocatalysis.									15	0	0	0	0	0	15			2196-0216			WOS:000607560400001		
J	Bae-Jung Kim; Fabbri, E.; Castelli, I.E.; Borlaf, M.; Graule, T.; Schmidt, T.J.								Fe-Doping in Double Perovskite PrBaCo2(1-x)Fe2xO6-delta: Insights into Structural and Electronic Effects to Enhance Oxygen Evolution Catalyst Stability								Catalysts				9	3			263 (17 pp.)	263 (17 pp.)		10.3390/catal9030263				March 2019	2019	Perovskite oxides have been gaining attention for its capability to be designed as an ideal electrocatalyst for oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Among promising candidates, the layered double perovskite-PrBaCo2O6-delta (PBC)-has been identified as the most active perovskite electrocatalyst for OER in alkaline media. For a single transition metal oxide catalyst, the addition of Fe enhances its electrocatalytic performance towards OER. To understand the role of Fe, herein, Fe is incorporated in PBC in different ratios, which yielded PrBaCo2(1-x)Fe2xO6-delta (x = 0, 0.2 and 0.5). Fe-doped PBCF's demonstrate enhanced OER activities and stabilities. Operando X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) revealed that Co is more stable in a lower oxidation state upon Fe incorporation by establishing charge stability. Hence, the degradation of Co is inhibited such that the perovskite structure is prolonged under the OER conditions, which allows it to serve as a platform for the oxy(hydroxide) layer formation. Overall, our findings underline synergetic effects of incorporating Fe into Co-based layered double perovskite in achieving a higher activity and stability during oxygen evolution reaction.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2073-4344			INSPEC:19215374

However, how to realize the stable and effective fabrication of the composite structure is urgently required but still a challenge. In this work, we constructed a novel electrocatalyst that abundant nitrogen-doped graphene quantum dots (NGQDs) are uniformly anchored on Ni(Fe)OxHy nanosheets through the strong M-N-C bonding. The synergistic effect between composite components greatly modifies the metal charge center with higher chemical valence and accelerates the hydroxylation process (*O ->*OOH) during OER process. Meanwhile, the smaller apparent activation energy (Ea) and faster proton coupled electron transfer (PCET) verify that the NGQDs/Ni(Fe)OxHy has more favorable reaction kinetics. Consequently, NGQDs/Ni(Fe)OxHy demonstrates an ultralow overpotential of 200 mV at 10 mA cm-2 with a long stability of 36 h. This work provides a viable method to realize the strong combination of carbon materials and metal hydroxides for excellent OER performance.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000741175000006

The sluggish four-electron process is known to be the bottleneck for enhancing the efficiency of OER. In this regard, tremendous efforts have been devoted to developing effective catalysts for OER. In addition to Ir- or Ru-based oxides taken as the benchmark, transition metal carbides have attracted ever-increasing interest due to the high activity and stability as low-cost OER electrocatalysts. In this review, the transition metal carbides for water oxidation electrocatalysis concerning design strategies and synthesis are briefly summarized. Some typical applications for various carbides are also highlighted. Besides, the development trends and outlook are also discussed.

In both cases increasing temperature seems to be an option. In this work, similarities and differences of the temperature-dependence of the kinetic overpotential of the oxygen evolution and reduction reactions are investigated. While both overpotentials decrease with temperature, only in PEWE a significant cell performance gain is obtained at relevant current densities due to the decreasing reversible thermodynamic cell voltage with temperature. Furthermore, for both reactions, the corresponding activation energies at constant overpotentials and constant cell voltages are determined according to the Butler-Volmer equation and transition state theory. At constant overpotentials a similar decrease in the activation energy from equilibrium conditions (approx. 67 kJ/mol) to an overpotential of about 0.3 V (approx. 40 kJ/mol) is observed and considered as a coincidence. That is, the activation energy of the supposed rate determining steps behaves similar with increasing the OER/ORR overpotential. Considering the technically important situation of constant cell voltage, the activation energy for PEFC is decreasing more rapidly due to the temperature induced decrease of the reversible thermodynamic cell voltage.

Due to the limitation of the OER process involving multiple electron transfer and multiple intermediates. Catalysts with a single active component can hardly exhibit high activity in this process. Here, we report an N, P-doped multiphase transition metal sulfide composite electrocatalyst (N, P-Co9S8/CoS2/Co1-xS) by an atmosphere conversion pyrolysis strategy. The multiple active components not only provide abundant catalytic active sites for the reaction at the catalytic interface but also the coupling tuning of the heterogeneous interface optimizes the valence orbital of the catalyst, which results in the catalyst exhibiting excellent catalytic activity. Both theoretical calculations and experimental investigations confirm the excellent adsorption kinetics of the intermediates at the interface. When used as an electrocatalyst for OER in alkaline environments, it exhibits robust activity (eta(10): 285 mV, Tafel slope: 70 mV dec(-1)) and long-term stability. Our study illustrates that compared with single-component cobalt-based sulfide, N, P-Co9S8/CoS2/ Co1-xS catalyst is favorable as highly efficient OER catalytic activity.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000775632700001

The efficiency of the overall process is usually limited by the sluggish kinetics of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) due to a complex four-electron/proton transfer mechanism. Therefore, the most crucial step for water electrolysis to become a widespread industrial process is to develop efficient electrocatalysts capable of driving the OER at a low overpotential. In this article, we present a review of the recent understanding of low-cost transition metal oxide-based catalysts for electrochemical OER. Our main focus is on the fundamental understanding of the electronic structure of these materials and its relationship with the catalytic activity and the reaction mechanism. We detail the electronic structure descriptors of the OER performance that have provided guidelines for the development of advanced electrocatalysts. Strategies to enhance the activity based on such electronic structure guidelines, including doping, strain and defect engineering are also discussed. Finally, we summarize the existing challenges and present perspectives for the future development of the field.									23	0	0	0	0	0	22			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000681375500001

Herein, a novel cactus-like NiCo2S4@NiFe LDH hollow sphere assembled by one-dimensional (1D) NiFe LDH nanowires and two-dimensional (2D) NiFe LDH nanosheets on the NiCo2S4 hollow spheres is prepared by a facile hydrothermal method. The outer NiFe LDH nanowires and NiFe LDH nanosheets can effectively suppress the collapse and corrosion of inner NiCo2S4 hollow structure during long-term stability tests. The integration of the effective OER electrocatalyst NiFe LDH into NiCo2S4 to form hetemstructures, as well as the strong electronic interaction between NiCo2S4 and NiFe LDH, can greatly boost both ORR and OER activities. Due to the above merits, the NiCo2S4@NiFe LDH achieves remarkably a small potential gap (Delta E = Ej=10-E-1/2) of only 0.667 V. This work offers a facile strategy to design efficient catalysts with heterostructures.									71	0	0	0	4	0	71			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000621624900001

Under normal conditions, oxygen reduction is the major cathodic reaction for carbon steel in SFGE. Hydrogen evolution, confirmed by hydrogen permeation test, is activated by de-aeration and at much higher cathodic overpotential. The dissociation of acetic acid in SFGE enhances the proton related cathodic reactions. Water in ethanol can increase the proton dissociation rate, resulting in a higher cathodic current density. At potentials close to free corrosion potential, the reduction of surface oxidized products contributes to the cathodic activities in SFGE. Based on this study, the possible effects of cathodic reactions on corrosion of carbon steel in SFGE are also discussed. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

We identified the catalyst as manganese (III) oxide with some alpha-Mn2O3 crystallinity in its initial state, but needed to further characterize the catalyst to understand its properties under reaction conditions. In this work, we performed cyclic voltammetry in an inert gas environment to identify electrochemical features of the catalyst and used ex-situ x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) to probe the surface oxidation state of manganese after exposing the catalyst to ORR or OER potentials. XPS did not detect a surface oxidation state difference between samples tested at ORR and OER potentials, while electrochemical methods could discern a difference in the oxidation state upon re-insertion of the samples into an electrochemical cell. This result suggested an extremely shallow depth of electrochemical oxidation.					11th Polymer Electrolyte Fuel Cell Symposium (PEFC) Under the Auspices of the 220th Meeting of the ECS11th Polymer Electrolyte Fuel Cell Symposium (PEFC) Under the Auspices of the 220th Meeting of the ECS	OCT, 2011OCT, 2011	ECS; Energy Technol (ETD); Phys & Analyt Electrochem (PAED); Battery (BATT); Ind Electrochem & Electrochem Engn (IEEE); Corros (CORR)ECS; Energy Technol (ETD); Phys & Analyt Electrochem (PAED); Battery (BATT); Ind Electrochem & Electrochem Engn (IEEE); Corros (CORR)	Boston, MABoston, MA	7	0	0	0	0	0	7			1938-5862		978-1-60768-255-4	WOS:000309598800163

Cheap and sustainable cellulose filter paper, infiltrated with nickel acetate as the nickel source, and phenanthroline as a ligand and nitrogen source are carbonized together. Nitrogen functionalities turn out to be crucial coordination sites for the supported Ni/NiO(OH) particles. This simple and scalable one step procedure leads to powders, but also to complete membranes made of approximate to 10 wt% Ni, supported on nitrogen functionalized carbon. The non-noble catalyst shows a low onset potential (330 mV vs reversible hydrogen electrode), high current density (e.g., j > 25 mA cm(-2) at = 430 mV), excellent kinetics (Tafel slope of 44 mV dec(-1)), and a very favorable stability (<5% decay after 10 h electrolysis) in the oxygen evolution. The performance is similar or even better compared to state-of-the-art noble metal catalysts (e.g., IrO2, Ir/C, Ru/C, and Pt/C). Because of the simple, cheap, and scalable preparation procedure the catalyst is highly promising for practical low price/tech applications. Interestingly, the system is also active in the hydrogen evolution reaction, leading to a promising bifunctional catalyst. The benchmark characteristics are (10) = 390 mV for oxygen evolution and (10) = 190 mV for hydrogen evolution, that is, an overall efficiency of 68% at 10 mA current density.									130	8	0	0	2	0	131			1614-6832	1614-6840		WOS:000351613200009

In an effort to develop an economical material for replacing precious-metal-based catalysts, a novel and self-standing amorphous ultrathin nanosheet (NS) of bimetallic iron-nickel boride (Fe-Ni-B NSs) on Ni foam is presented, which displays a better oxygen-evolving activity compared to the precious-metal catalyst RuO2. In 1.0 m KOH electrolyte solution, it requires an overpotential of only 237 mV to reach a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) with a small Tafel slope of 38 mV dec(-1) and shows prominent long-term electrochemical stability. A synergistic effect between highly abundant catalytically active sites on the 3D porous substrate improved the electron transport arising from the presence of highly negative boron, and the high conductivity of the substrate results in an outstanding electrocatalytic activity. The advanced catalytic activity, facile electrode fabrication, and low costs make it a potential oxygen-evolving material, which may be extended to other energy-conversion and storage technologies.									59	4	0	0	1	0	59			0947-6539	1521-3765		WOS:000452614800033	29797380

Synthetic Fe porphyrins have been extensively studied as ORR catalysts, but activity improvement is required. On the other hand, Fe porphyrins have been rarely shown to be efficient for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). We herein report an enzyme-inspired Fe porphyrin 1 as an efficient catalyst for both ORR and OER. Complex 1, which bears a tethered imidazole for Fe binding, beats imidazole-free analogue 2, with an anodic shift of ORR half-wave potential by 160 mV and a decrease of OER overpotential by 150 mV to get the benchmark current density at 10 mA cm(-2). Theoretical studies suggested that hydroxide attack to a formal Fe-V=O form the O-O bond. The axial imidazole can prevent the formation of trans HO-Fe-V=O, which is less effective to form O-O bond with hydroxide. As a practical demonstration, we assembled rechargeable Zn-air battery with 1, which shows equal performance to that with Pt/Ir-based materials.									66	7	0	0	3	0	67			1433-7851	1521-3773		WOS:000621803600001	33462971

Electrocatalysts for OER based on non-precious transition metals are highly desirable. Herein, iron and nickel mixed oxides with surface oxygen vacancies were fabricated using (NiFeII)-Fe-II-Prussian blue analog as the precursors by a facile two-step thermal-assisted method. The precursor compositions and calcination temperatures exert great impact on the structure and morphology of the derivatives, as well as the electrocatalytic performances for OER. Both the higher content of Ni ions during the synthesis of precursors and lower calcination temperature favor the electrocatalytic performance of the corresponding derivatives. The porous metal oxides consisting of nickel oxide and nickel ferrite exhibited the remarkable electrocatalytic property toward OER in an alkaline solution, which can be attributed to the nanosized and porous structure, the co-existence of spinel NiFe2O4 and cubic NiO, the high content of surface oxygen vacancies, and the low charge transfer resistance. This study will provide new inspiration for the facile design of low-cost active catalysts for OER in the future.									17	0	0	0	1	0	17			2296-2646			WOS:000477873700001	31428599

Based on isobaric projections in the Ag-CuO-Cu2O system, two invariant reactions, L-1 = CuO + Cu2O + Ag and L-2 = CuO + Cu2O + L-1, were deduced.									37	1	0	0	0	0	37			0002-7820			WOS:000075368600025

Here, we present a nanostructured LSCF@Pd matrix of nanostructured LSCF (Nano-LSCF) with palladium to enhance the bifunctional catalytic activity in Li-O-2 battery applications. Pd nanoparticles can be perfectly supported on the surface of the Nano-LSCF, and the ORR catalytic activity was properly improved. When Nano-LSCF@Pd was applied to a cathode catalyst in Li-O-2 batteries, the first discharge ability (16912 mA h g(-1)) was higher than that of Nano-LSCF (6707 mA h g(-1)) and the cycling property improved. These results demonstrate that the Pd-deposited nanostructured perovskite is a capable catalyst to enhance the ORR activity of LSCF as a promising bifunctional electrocatalyst.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			2574-0962			WOS:000504953500033

Herein, we report a highly active monometallic Fe catalyst by constructing Fe3O4/FeS(2)heterostructures. Particularly, anin situsulfuration route leads to a series of heterostructured Fe3O4/FeS(2)materials which have tunable sulfuration degrees and variable contents of heterogeneous interfaces. At the OER conducted in an alkaline system, the acquired Fe3O4/FeS2-2.5 catalyst with the most abundant hetero-interfaces, exhibits superior performance by delivering ultralow overpotentials and good durabilities. Density functional theory computation reveals that charge redistribution at the interface region decreases the activation barrier for forming oxygen-containing intermediates which greatly accelerates the sluggish OER kinetics. This work clarifies that monometallic Fe based materials can deliver a high OER activity, and Fe should be the actual active site in this reaction. Besides, constructing heterogeneous structures with different anion species which received less attention before, may represent a promising strategy for designing highly active monometallic catalysts.									23	2	0	0	1	0	24			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000551538000026

Herein, regulation of electronic structure is realized by introducing oxygen vacancy into SnO2 on Ti3C2Tx MXene (Vo-SnO2/Ti3C2Tx), which acts as physical scaffold to form a stable interface. The fully exposed active sites combining the heterogeneous interface is favorable for optimizing the adsorption capability of Vo-SnO2/Ti3C2Tx for intermediate species and promoting interfacial charge transfer, which will accelerate the kinetics of both oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The high round-trip efficiency (84%), large specific capacity (18648 mA h g-1) and extended cyclability with low overpotential (200 cycles) of the Vo-SnO2/Ti3C2Tx based LOBs experimentally confirm its superior electrocatalytic activity. This study provides a general approach for developing superior electrocatalysts via electronic structure modulation for high performance LOBs.

Herein, the coupling between oxygen vacancies and interface engineering is highlighted to fabricate a novel amorphous/crystalline CrOx-Ni3N heterostructure grown on Ni foam for accelerating the alkaline hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that the electron transfer from amorphous CrOx to Ni3N at the interfaces, and the optimized Gibbs free energies of H2O dissociation (Delta G(H-OH)) and H adsorption (Delta G(H)) in the amorphous/crystalline CrOx-Ni3N heterostructure are conducive to the superior and stable HER activity. Experimental data confirm that numerous oxygen vacancies and amorphous/crystalline interfaces in the CrOx-Ni3N catalysts are favorable for abundant accessible active sites and enhanced intrinsic activity, resulting in excellent catalytic performances for HER and OER. Additionally, the in situ reconstruction of CrOx-Ni3N into highly active Ni3N/Ni(OH)(2) is responsible for the optimized OER performance in a long-term stability test. Eventually, an alkaline electrolyzer using CrOx-Ni3N as both cathode and anode has a low cell voltage of 1.53 V at 10 mA cm(-2), together with extraordinary durability for 500 h, revealing its potential in industrial applications.									15	0	0	0	1	0	15			1613-6810	1613-6829		WOS:000754186800001	35150071

However, the rational design and facile fabrication of metal oxides shell with high activity and high surface area remain challenging. Here, we report a facile halides-assisted electrooxidation method for the synthesis of three dimensional (3D) Cu/Cu2O/CuO hybrid foams as free-standing OER electrodes. The hybrid foams are composed of Cu core with high conductivity and Cu2O/CuO hybrid shell with nanoarray architectures which can increase the surface area and enhance the diffusion of liquid reactants and gas products. As expected, the as-prepared Cu/ Cu2O/CuO electrocatalyst exhibits an overpotential of 0.289 V at 10 mA cm(-2) as well as a long-term durability. The results of this study may be beneficial for the fabrication of hybrid hierarchical electmcatalysts and the designing of core-shell structures for gas-involving electrocatalytic reactions.									16	0	0	0	0	0	16			0378-7753	1873-2755		WOS:000523642000011

It is crucial to develop alternative and efficient anode materials for SOEC5. Herein, a series of novel Y0.95-xSrxCo0.3Fe0.7O3-delta (YSCF-x) orthorhombic perovskite oxides in the Pnma (62) space group are synthesized as anode materials of SOEC5. Physicochemical characterizations and density functional theory calculations reveal that the partial substitution of Y3+ by Sr2+ increases the oxygen vacancy concentration and mobility as well as improves the electrical conductivity, which contributes to the excellent OER activity of YSCF-x. At 800 degrees C, the current density of SOEC with YSCF-0.05-Ce0.8Sm0.2O2-delta anode can reach 1.32 A cm(-2) at 1.6 V, about twice that of SOEC with Y0.95Co0.3Fe0.7O3-delta-Ce0.8Sm0.2O2-delta anode.

Whereas the presence of Fe ions is essential to the high activity, the functions of Fe are currently under debate. Using oxygen isotope labeling and operando Raman spectroscopic experiments, we obtain turnover frequencies (TOFs) of both Ni and Fe sites for a series of Ni and NiFe layered double hydroxides (LDHs), which are structurally defined samples of the corresponding oxyhydroxides. The Fe sites have TOFs 20200 times higher than the Ni sites such that at an Fe content of 4.7% and above the Fe sites dominate the catalysis. Higher Fe contents lead to larger structural disorder of the NiOOH host. A volcano-type correlation was found between the TOFs of Fe sites and the structural disorder of NiOOH. Our work elucidates the origin of the Fe-dependent activity of NiFe LDH, and suggests structural ordering as a strategy to improve OER catalysts.									152	7	0	0	16	0	156			1433-7851	1521-3773		WOS:000536953100016	32078226

Herein, a series of different ratio of Se doped Co3O4 nanoparticles XSe-Co3O4 are prepared by hydrothermal method and applied as OER electrocatalysts. Se2xe003; is doped into the Co3O4 crystal lattice by substituting of O2xe003; and a large number of oxygen vacancies are generated, which provides more available activity sites for OER. Se doping increases the surface ratio of Co2 thorn / Co3 thorn and accelerates the electron transport that favors OER activity promotion. The optimized doping ratio of 6%Se-Co3O4 presents low overpotential of 281 mV at 10 mA cmxe003;2, as well as a low Tafel slope of 70 mV decxe003;1 in 1 M KOH solution, which has great advantages compared to the recently reported Co3O4-based OER electrocatalysts.

Herein, oxygen vacancy-rich nanoporous nickel foam (NF) electrodes decorated with nanosized NiFe layered double hydroxide are fabricated by a facile and scalable electrochemical treatment using FeCl3 solutions as OER and HER electrocatalysts in an alkaline medium. The roles of Cl- and Fe3+ ions are analyzed by electrochemical and surface-enhanced X-ray analysis techniques. The Cl anions increase the active sites by producing nanopores on the NF surface and promote oxygen vacancies, while the Fe cations enhance the inherent catalytic activity for water oxidation. The FeCl3-treated NF shows enhanced catalytic activities and maintains an overpotential of 520 mV at 100 mA cm(-2) for 150 h in a 10 cm(2) single cell. The results demonstrate that the simple electrochemical treatment is a promising method to produce oxygen vacancy-induced scalable electrodes with large surface areas for various applications.									9	0	0	0	1	0	9			2168-0485			WOS:000575352800021

It is constructed from graphene sheets evenly covered with TiONx on which PtCu, Ir, and Ru nanoparticles are immobilized. It enables high performances for oxygen reduction, hydrogen and methanol oxidation, and also hydrogen and oxygen evolution. Its activity is either higher or comparable to the monofunctional benchmark catalysts, namely, Pt, PtRu, and Ir nanoparticles. An important part of this study is the advanced electrochemical degradation investigation. With the use of an electrochemical flow cell coupled to ICP-MS and combining these results with identical location electron microscopy, we reveal not only potential shortcomings but also opportunities for our material. As a result, we also put forward general guidelines for the appropriate use of multifunctional electrocatalysts.									10	1	0	0	0	0	10			2155-5435			WOS:000502169900080

We performed a systematic characterization on the nature of the IrxCu1-x solid-solution alloys using powder X-ray diffraction, scanning transmission electron microscopy coupled with energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. The results showed that the IrxCu1-x alloys had a face-centered-cubic structure; charge transfer from Cu to Ir occurred in the alloy nanoparticles, as the core-level Ir 4f peaks shifted to lower energy region with the increase in Cu content. Furthermore, we observed that the alloying of Ir with Cu enhanced both the electrocatalytic oxygen evolution and oxygen reduction reactions. The enhanced activities could be attributed to the electronic interaction between Ir and Cu arising from the alloying effect at atomic-level.									62	2	0	0	5	0	62			1433-7851	1521-3773		WOS:000430165700007	29436095

Cost-effective transition-metal oxides with reasonable activity are raising attention. Recently, OER reactants' and products' differing spin configurations have been thought to cause slow reaction kinetics. Catalysts with magnetically polarized channels could selectively remove electrons with opposite magnetic moment and conserve overall spin during OER, enhancing triplet state oxygen molecule evolution. Herein, antiferromagnetic inverse spinel oxide LiCoVO4 is found to contain d(7) Co2+ ions that can be stabilized under active octahedral sites, possessing high spin states S = 3/2 (t(2g)(5)e(g)(2)). With high spin configuration, each Co2+ ion has an ideal magnetic moment of 3 mu(B), allowing the edge-shared Co2+ octahedra in spinel to be magnetically polarized. Density functional theory simulation results show that the layered antiferromagnetic LiCoVO4 studied contains magnetically polarized channels. The average magnetic moment (mu(ave)) per transition-metal atom in the spin conduction channel is around 2.66 mu(B). Such channels are able to enhance the selective removal of spin-oriented electrons from the reactants during the OER, which facilitates the accumulation of appropriate magnetic moments for triplet oxygen molecule evolution. In addition, the LiCoVO4 reported has been identified as an oxide catalyst with excellent OER activity.									50	1	0	0	4	0	51			0935-9648	1521-4095		WOS:000510215800001	32003079

Note here that the difference between dopant and impurity is merely semantic-dopant is an impurity deliberately added to the material. We contest the general belief that all doping has a positive effect on electrocatalysis. We show that in many cases, dopants actually inhibit the electrochemistry of 2D materials.

The difference in OER overpotential for the three surface orientations, (200), (002) and (020), is found to be very small (0.07 V). The presence of oxygen vacancies in the first WO3 sub-layer do not favor OER, while vacancies in the second sub-layer do reduce the OER overpotential. A volcano plot with all overpotentials calculated in this study shows that the OER is favored at the Mo doped (200) surface (reactions happen at the Mo site). This paper demonstrates that DFT calculations of the electrochemical activity are an efficient method to identify active surfaces and can therefore save a lot of experimental effort in designing more efficient photoelectrodes for water splitting.									39	1	0	0	4	0	39			0920-5861	1873-4308		WOS:000451030700014

The key electrochemistry of a nonaqueous Li-O-2 battery highly relies on the formation of Li2O2 during discharge and its reversible decomposition during charge. The properties of Li2O2 and its formation mechanisms are of high significance in influencing the battery performance. This review article demonstrates the latest progress in understanding the Li2O2 electrochemistry and the recent advances in regulating the Li2O2 growth pathway. The first part of this review elaborates the Li2O2 formation mechanism and its relationship with the oxygen reduction reaction/oxygen evolution reaction electrochemistry. The following part discusses how the cycling parameters, e.g., current density and discharge depth, influence the Li2O2 morphology. A comprehensive summary of recent strategies in tailoring Li2O2 formation including rational design of cathode structure, certain catalyst, and surface engineering is demonstrated. The influence resulted from the electrolyte, e.g., salt, solvent, and some additives on Li2O2 growth pathway, is finally discussed. Further prospects of the ways in making advanced Li-O-2 batteries by control of favorable Li2O2 formation are highlighted, which are valuable for practical construction of aprotic lithium-oxygen batteries.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			2366-9608			WOS:000720734800001	35041287

Layered double hydroxides (LDHs), due to their unique lamellar structure and flexibility of chemical component, are very competing material candidates for OER. Herein, the morphology structure and the electronic structure of LDHs were simultaneously tuned to improve the OER catalytic activity by mild solvothermal reduction using ethylene glycol. The increased surface area, the introduction of oxygen vacancies and the construction of hierarchical structure greatly enhanced the electro-catalytic activity of LDHs for OER. The as-prepared LDHs showed a lower over-potential as low as 276 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2), and a small Tafel slope of 40.3 mV dec(-1) accompanied with good stability. This work provides an efficient way to the design and optimization of advanced catalysts in the future.									58	14	0	0	1	0	58			1674-7291	1869-1870		WOS:000489889900013

However, we currently lack efficient electrocatalysts to selectively perform the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) over the oxidation of the chloride ions that are the main components of seawater. In this contribution, we report an engineering strategy to synthesize heterogeneous electrocatalysts by the simultaneous formation of separate chalcogenides of nickel (NiSx, x = 0, 2/3, 8/9, and 4/3) and cobalt (CoSx, x = 0 and 8/9) onto a carbon-nitrogen-sulfur nanostructured network. Specifically, the oxidative aniline polymerization in the presence of metallic cations was combined with the calcination to regulate the separate formation of various self-supported phases in order to target the multifunctional applicability as both hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and OER in a simulated alkaline seawater. The OER's metric current densities of 10 and 100 mA cm(-2) were achieved at the bimetallic for only 1.60 and 1.63 V-RHE, respectively. This high-performance was maintained in the electrolysis with a starting voltage of 1.6 V and satisfactory stability at 100 mA over 17 h. Our findings validate a high selectivity for OER of similar to 100%, which outperforms the previously reported data of 87-95%.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3				1420-3049		WOS:000707964500001	34641469

Herein, a hierarchical CuO@Cu3P/CF nanowire core-shell heterostructure with transferable active centers was developed for a bifunctional electrocatalyst with high activity. In this system, the transfer of electrochemically active centers between Cu3P and CuO is used to facilitate the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), respectively. Particularly, Cu3P acts as the active center for HER, while the active center shifts to CuO for OER reaction, and Cu3P acts as a co-catalyst to improve the conductivity of the system. Benefit from superhydrophilicity's high electrochemical surface area and synergistic effect of CuO core and Cu3P shell, and CuO@Cu3P/CF shown significant catalytic activity for hydrogen or oxygen evolution, requiring low overpotentials of 144 and 267 mV to achieve a current density of 10 mA cm-2. In addition, the assembled CuO@Cu3P/CF-based electrolyzer exhibit excellent overall water splitting performance with a low operating voltage of 1.75 V at 10 mA cm-2 and a negligible decrease in catalytic activity. This gives encouraging evidence for the utility of our catalysts in application areas. All rights reserved Elsevier.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			1879-3487			INSPEC:21867843

Here, we propose that for beta-Ni(OH)(2) and NiO, the NOR activity origins are beta-Ni(OH)O containing electrophilic lattice oxygen and NiO(OH)ads containing electrophilic adsorption oxygen, respectively. For beta-Ni(OH)(2), NOR is a two-step, one-electron reaction, including an electrogenerated catalyst dehydrogenation reaction and a spontaneous nucleophile dehydrogenation reaction. Therefore, the NOR activity of beta-Ni(OH)(2) can be markedly regulated by tuning the lattice oxygen ligand environment. For beta-Co0.1Ni0.9(OH)(2), the onset potential of NOR with different nucleophiles is similar to 1.29 V (1 M KOH), which breaks the bottleneck of similar to 1.35 V for most nickel-based catalysts. Overall, we identify the activity origins and propose the design principles of nickel-based catalysts for NOR. These provide theoretical guidance for the development of NOR and organic electrosynthesis in practical industrial applications.									99	7	0	0	13	0	101			2451-9294			WOS:000588426900013

In order to realize their practical applications, highly efficient and inexpensive non-noble metal-based oxygen electrocatalysts are urgently required. Herein, we report a novel iron-chelated urea-formaldehyde resin hydrogel for the synthesis of Fe-N-C electrocatalysts. This novel hydrogel is prepared using a new instantaneous (20 s) one-step scalable strategy, which theoretically ensures the atomic-level dispersion of Fe ions in the urea-formaldehyde resin, guaranteeing the microstructural homogeneity of the electrocatalyst. Consequently, the prepared electrocatalyst exhibits higher catalytic activity and durability in the oxygen reduction (ORR) and evolution (OER) reactions than the commercial Pt/C catalyst. Furthermore, the above catalyst also shows a much better performance in rechargeable Zn-air batteries, including higher power density and better cycling stability. The developed synthetic approach opens up new avenues toward the development of sustainable active electrocatalysts for electrochemical energy devices.									72	4	0	0	2	0	73			1998-0124	1998-0000		WOS:000417196000032

Herein an overview of their potential in energy storage systems in place of precious metals is conducted. The most recent progress on vdW electrocatalysis covering the last three years of research is evaluated, with an emphasis on their catalytic activity towards the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), oxygen evolution reaction (OER), and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). This analysis is conducted in pair with the most active Pt-based commercial catalyst currently utilized in energy systems that rely on the above-listed electrochemistry (metal-air battery, fuel cells, and water electrolyzers). Based on current progress in HER catalysis that employs vdW materials, several recommendations can be stated. First, stacking of the two types vdW materials, with one being graphene or its doped derivatives, results in significantly improved HER activity. The second important recommendation is to take advantage of an electronic coupling when stacking 2D materials with the metallic surface. This significantly reduces the face-to-face contact resistance and thus improves the electron transfer from the metallic surface to the vdW catalytic plane. A dual advantage can be achieved from combining the vdW heterostructure with metals containing an excess of d electrons (e.g., gold). Despite these recent and promising discoveries, more studies are needed to solve the complexity of the mechanism of HER reaction, in particular with respect to the electron coupling effects (metal/vdW combinations). In addition, more affordable synthetic pathways allowing for a well-controlled confined HER catalysis are emerging areas.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4				1996-1944		WOS:000671135500001	34279324

Alkaline systems allow the use of non-noble metals, which favors a considerable reduction of the system cost. In this work, a cost-effective perovskite, La0.6Sr0.4Fe0.8CO0.2O3, has been investigated as bifunctional catalyst in a 6 M KOH alkaline solution. The perovskite was mixed with an experimental carbon black, characterized by a graphitic structure and a specific surface area of 220 m(2) g(-1). The perovskite-carbon composite was compared to a Pd/C catalyst (employing the same carbon black as support). Generally, bifunctional catalysts are subjected to high electrochemical potentials, particularly during the oxygen evolution. In order to assess the stability of the bifunctional catalyst, several accelerated degradation tests were performed. Results proved that the perovskite-carbon composite showed good performance for both reactions, in particular for the oxygen evolution. Furthermore, it also presented enhanced stability vs. Pd/C when subjected to degradation tests, maintaining a constant potential over time, even working at high current densities (80 and 125 mA cm(-2)). This material is envisaged as a very promising bifunctional catalyst, in particular in terms of durability. (C) 2017 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Many efforts put in place in addressing this problem have resulted in huge successes by employing different routes for synthesizing electrocatalysts, using different families of atoms and compounds. In this regard, this review describes the conceptual study of OER and an overview of electrocatalytic kinetics and theoretical modeling for oxygen evolution reaction.

The study also includes some tutorial manuals for describing various parameters needed in electrochemical OER processes. We do hope they will be the useful guiding principles for the newcomers in this field. Interestingly, the emphasis is focused on describing different families of compounds used to synthesize high-performance OER electrocatalysts: which include transition metal compounds, polyoxometalates, carbon nanotubes, single atoms, layered double hydroxide, and non-metal compounds. Conclusively, important future perspectives to foster the advancement of this field are discussed. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V.

Here, a facile approach is reported to transform wood into hierarchical porous graphene using CO2 laser scribing. Studies reveal that the crosslinked lignocellulose structure inherent in wood with higher lignin content is more favorable for the generation of high-quality graphene than wood with lower lignin content. Because of its high electrical conductivity (approximate to 10 Omega per square), graphene patterned on wood surfaces can be readily fabricated into various high-performance devices, such as hydrogen evolution and oxygen evolution electrodes for overall water splitting with high reaction rates at low overpotentials, and supercapacitors for energy storage with high capacitance. The versatility of this technique in formation of multifunctional wood hybrids can inspire both research and industrial interest in the development of wood-derived graphene materials and their nanodevices.									269	26	0	0	16	0	279			0935-9648	1521-4095		WOS:000412184100010	28737226

Herein we demonstrate that nanostructured Nickel Selenide (NiSe2) exhibits excellent capability for OER owing to the high compatibility between (200) plane and alkaline solution. The dendrite-like nickel selenide achieves a specific current density of 10 mA/cm(2) at an overpotential low to similar to 299 mV. The NiSe2 has high stability, in which overpotential decreased similar to 2 mV after 10 000 cycles. We demonstrated that the catalytic efficiency of OER could be promoted by increasing the exposure ratio of (200) plane. This work discloses that kinetics of OER are related to specific facets exposure, in which it opens up the possibility of designing active and stable catalysts for OER utilization.

Moreover, these processes can often be driven by renewable energy under ambient conditions as a sustainable alternative to traditional high-temperature and high-pressure synthesis methods. In addition to the extensive studies on catalyst development, increasing attention has been paid to the regulation of gas transport/diffusion behaviors during gas-involving (photo)electrocatalytic reactions towards the goal of creating industrially viable catalytic systems with high reaction rates, excellent long-term stabilities and near-unity selectivities. Biomimetic surfaces and systems with special wetting capabilities and structural advantages can shed light on the future design of (photo)electrodes and address long-standing challenges. This article is dedicated to bridging the fields of wetting and catalysis by reviewing the cutting-edge design methodologies of both gas-evolving and gas-consuming (photo)electrocatalytic systems. We first introduce the fundamentals of various in-air/underwater wetting states and their corresponding bioinspired structural properties. The relationship amongst the bubble transport behavior, wettability, and porosity/tortuosity is also discussed. Next, the latest implementations of wetting-related design principles for gas-evolving reactions (i.e. the hydrogen evolution reaction and oxygen evolution reaction) and gas-consuming reactions (i.e. the oxygen reduction reaction and CO2 reduction reaction) are summarized. For photoelectrode designs, additional factors are taken into account, such as light absorption and the separation, transport and recombination of photoinduced electrons and holes. The influences of wettability and 3D structuring of (photo)electrodes on the catalytic activity, stability and selectivity are analyzed to reveal the underlying mechanisms. Finally, remaining questions and related future perspectives are outlined.									13	1	0	0	0	0	13			0306-0012	1460-4744		WOS:000683063100001	34369513

Bulk-scale solid-state compounds can be readily produced using high-temperature reactions and therefore used to expand the scope of earth-abundant OER catalysts capable of operating under strongly acidic conditions. Here, we show that high temperature arc melting and powder metallurgy reactions can be used to synthesize electrodes consisting of intermetallic Ni2Ta that can catalyze the OER in 0.50 M H2SO4. Arc melted Ni2Ta electrodes evolve oxygen at a current density of 10 mA/cm(2) for >66 h with corrosion rates 2 orders of magnitude lower than that of pure Ni. The overpotential required for pellets of polycrystalline Ni2Ta to produce a current density of 10 mA/cm(2) is 570 mV. This strategy can be generalized to include other first-row transition metals, including intermetallic Fe2Ta and Co2Ta systems.									39	1	0	0	2	0	40			0020-1669	1520-510X		WOS:000433013600031	29714476

However, tuning ligand fields of the active center by single-site metal cation regulation and identifying the effects on the resulting electronic configuration is seldom explored. Herein, we propose a single-site Ru cation coordination strategy to engineer the electronic properties by constructing a Ru/LiCoO2 SAC with atomically dispersed Ru-Co pair sites. Benefitting from the strong electronic coupling between Ru and Co sites, the catalyst possesses an enhanced electrical conductivity and achieves near-optimal oxygen adsorption energies. Therefore, the optimized catalyst delivers superior oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity with low overpotential, the high mass activity of 1000 A g(oxide)(-1) at a small overpotential of 335 mV, and excellent long-term stability. It also exhibits rapid kinetics with superior rate capability and outstanding durability in a zinc-air battery.									10	0	0	0	0	0	10			1433-7851	1521-3773		WOS:000813613700001	35638304

In this work, oxygen-containing free-standing carbon cloth with abundant pores (e-CC-H-2) has been obtained through a facile two-step electrochemical oxidation and hydrogen etching method. Compared to the previous activation strategies of carbon cloth (such as chemical activation), this method has the advantages of simplicity, time-saving, low-cost and energy-saving. Benefiting from the abundance of defects and oxygen-containing functional groups that are active sites for oxygen evolution reaction, the obtained e-CC-H-2 shows excellent electrocatalytic activity, with a low overpotential of 350 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2), a low Tafel slope (127 mV dec(-1)) and stable electrochemical activity.

With the unique properties of polyoxometalate and MOFs materials as well as rich transition metal contents, herein we successfully synthesize a novel bi-phase structure of cobalt and molybdenum carbide coated with nitrogen-doped graphite (Co-Mo2C@NC) which possesses excellent activity as water splitting electrocatalyst at neutral pH. This noble metal-free, bi-phase electrocatalyst exhibits Hydrogen Evolution Reaction (HER) and Oxygen Evolution Reaction (OER) overpotentials of 260 mV and 440 mV at 10 mA cm(-2), respectively. The two-electrode system using Co-Mo2C@NC as both the anode and cathode drives 10 mA cm(-2) at a cell voltage of 1.83 V with a remarkable long-term stability. Besides, the Co-Mo2C@NC also shows promising activity in alkaline condition that reaches 10 mA cm(-2) at a cell voltage of 1.66 V.

Accordingly, substantial endeavors have been made to explore advanced electrode materials over the past decade. Recently, RuO2 and RuO2-based materials have been demonstrated to be promising for OER due to their remarkable electrocatalytic activity and pH-universal application. Herein, the great achievements and progresses of this flourishing spot are comprehensively reviewed, which are started by a general description of OER to understand the reaction mechanism in detail. Subsequently, the key advantages and issues of RuO2 towards OER are also introduced, followed by proposing many advanced strategies for further promoting the electrocatalytic OER performance of RuO2. Finally, the daunting challenges and future progresses of RuO2 electrocatalysts toward practical water oxidation are highlighted, aiming to provide guidance for the fabrication of desirable RuO2-based electrocatalysts toward OER.

In this study, we report an electro-spinning method by adding supramolecular coordination polymers to selected polyacrylonitrile (PAN) and cellulose acetate (CA) spinning systems. Benefiting from the difference in the thermal decomposition temperature of each component during the pyrolysis process, CA was applied as a sacrificial template to prepare a high-efficiency ORR/OER bifunctional electro-catalyst (Co-N@PCNFs-0.2) with directional hollow channels and a hierarchical pore structure. This unique multichannel carbon nanofiber morphology and hierarchical pore structure led to abundant active sites while also boosting the electron transfer rates. Notably, applying Co-N@PCNFs-0.2 as an air electrode to Zn-air batteries results in a large specific discharge capacity of 884 W h kgZn(-1) and a maximum power density of 151 mW cm(-2).									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			2168-0485			WOS:000731040100001

The preoxidized amorphous Ni-Co alloys showed Tafel behaviour characteristic of Co oxides. However, after potential cycling, the electrocatalytic activity of amorphous and crystalline Ni-Co alloys increased drastically and their Tafel behaviour showed characteristics similar to pure Ni electrodes. Nickel-rich amorphous alloys showed particularly high activity towards the OER in comparison with their crystalline counterparts and the Co-rich amorphous alloy. In addition, Ni and the amorphous Ni-Co alloys showed good stability as electrocatalysts while crystalline Ni-Co alloys were not stable upon potential cycling.									53	1	0	0	3	0	54			0013-4686			WOS:A1992GU70500025

The surface reconstruction of a-CoW and its evolution were described by regulating oxygen vacancies. With continuous dissolution of W species, oxygen vacancies on the surface were generated rapidly, the surface reconstruction was promoted, and the OER performance was improved significantly. During the surface reconstruction, W species also played a role in electronic modulation for Co. Due to its rapid surface reconstruction, a-CoW exhibited excellent OER performance in alkaline electrolyte with an overpotential of 208 mV at 10 mAcm(2) and had long-term stability for at least 120 h. This work shows that the transition metal dissolution-oxygen vacancy strategy is effective for preparation of high-performance catalysts.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			1864-5631	1864-564X		WOS:000722255600001	34709735

In this work, a facile in-situ partial reduction strategy is proposed to fabricate Co/CoSe Schottky junctions encapsulated in carbon (Co/ CoSe@NC). The heterojunction in the Co/CoSe@NC can tune Fermi level and charge redistribution to accelerate the charge transfer, while the metal-organic framework derived skeleton provides well-defined structure and abundant mesopores to facilitate mass transport. The accelerated charge transfer through the Mott-Schottky heterostructure can improve the intrinsic electrocatalytic activities for both electron-gaining ORR and electron-losing OER, which are confirmed by systematic characterizations and density functional theory calcu-lations. Furthermore, the Zn-air battery with the as-prepared Co/CoSe@NC heterojunction shows better per-formance than the Pt/RuO2-based counterpart, demonstrating good feasibility for practical applications.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000830496400003

The electron transfer numbers were range from 3.2 to 3.8,close to four electron transfer mechanism. This indicates that electrocatalytic properties of the NiCo_2O_4 electrode is excellent,which probably due to the unique structural feature with more edge defect.			以水热法并进一步焙烧合成脊椎状NiCo_2O_4纳米棒,通过透射电子显微镜(TEM) 、X射线衍射仪(XRD) 、X射线光电子能谱仪(XPS)和热重分析仪(TG)等来表征其结构形态及热稳定性.采用线性扫描法(LSV) 、循环伏安(CV)研究所制备催化剂的在玻碳和旋转圆盘电极上的电催化活性:在0.1 mol·L~(-1) KOH溶液中的电催化析氧反应(OER)和电催化氧还原反应(ORR).研究结果表明,所制备的脊椎状NiCo_2O_4纳米棒有大量的不饱和态,200 ℃焙烧制备的脊椎状NiCo_2O_4纳米棒析氧过电位最小可达309 mV,Tafel斜率145.6 mV/dec,其氧还原极限电流密度在1600 rmp可达到5.095 mA·cm~(-2),电子转移数在3.2~ 3.8之间,接近四电子转移机理,其优良电化学性能可能是由于暴露了更多的边缘缺陷的缘故.						0	1	0	0	0	0	1			1001-3555			CSCD:6444266

The highest heats were observed when the metals were treated with micromole quantities of argon, prior to absorption of hydrogen, as well as its interactions with metal particles reaching nanometer size. In the latter case the heat evolutions due to the interactions with hydrogen were approaching 5000 kJ/mol. The interactions with oxygen in inert gas environments, such as that of argon, yielded higher heat evolutions than those given by pure O-2 pulses injected into nitrogen carrier gas.The results revealed an important role of argon in increasing the intensity of atomic hydrogen-oxygen reactions to a level several times higher than the heat of water formation from molecular hydrogen and oxygen.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			0929-5607	1572-8757		WOS:000317620800005

The changes of their electrochemical activity for oxygen evolution (OE) reaction with accelerated electrolysis time have been studied. The results show that the activity of the electrodes decreases with increasing electrolysis time. This can be attributed to the conductivity variations, which are caused by the decrease of the oxygen vacancy concentration in PbO2 films during OE. The mechanism of the decrease of the oxygen vacancies has been investigated. For F-PbO2 film electrodes, though its electrochemical activity is somewhat lower than that of undoped one, its activity stability is much higher in comparison with that of PbO2. The influence of F- doping on the activity of PbO2 film electrodes has been also discussed. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

Herein, we demonstrate such a catalyst material in the form of carbon confined iron-nickel alloy/iron fluoride doped by oxygen (C/O-FeNi/FeF2) derived from the Fe2Ni MIL MOF via facile carbonization and fluorination for efficient oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in the water-splitting reaction. The structural transformation from the Fe2Ni MIL MOF to the C/O-FeNi/FeF2 is demonstrated by the spectroscopic analysis and correlated to their electrochemical catalytic performance. Because of some combined merits resulting from the carbon confined active phase, increased polarity, strong electronic effect and efficient synergism of metal and metal fluoride for the facile active phase reconstruction in this hybrid system, this catalyst exhibits many good characteristics for electrochemical measurements in terms of improved conductivity, high intrinsic activity and stability, fast catalytic kinetics, increase surface area and rapid charge transfer ability. Specifically, the C/O-FeNi/FeF2 catalysts have a low overpotential of ca. 250 mV when loaded on a glass carbon electrode to offer the current density of 10 mA cm(-2) in the alkaline electrolyte for OER; and no obvious performance decay is observed in the long-term stability test conducted at different potentials. The current results will be instructive for novel carbon confined catalyst and MOF derived catalyst design and fabrication in the energy catalysis reaction.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000799813100003

Constructing heterostructure and oxygen vacancies have demonstrated great promises to boost the OER performance. Herein, we report a facile strategy to fabricate hetero-structured NiFe2O4/Ni(3)S(4)nanorods, where NiFe(2)O(4)can be derived from Fe-based metal-organic frameworks (MOFs). The NiFe2O4/Ni(3)S(4)catalyst exhibited excellent OER performance, evidenced by an overpotential value of 357 mV at the current density of 20 mA cm(-2), and a small Tafel slope of 87.46 mV dec(-1)in 1 M KOH, superior to the benchmark IrO(2)catalyst. Moreover, NiFe2O4/Ni(3)S(4)outperformed with regard to long-term durability for OER than IrO2. Such outstanding OER performance is mainly accounted by the interface between NiFe(2)O(4)and Ni3S4, and the presence of rich oxygen vacancies. When employed as air-cathode in zinc-air batteries, the NiFe2O4/Ni(3)S(4)decorated battery had a high round-trip efficiency of 62.1% at 10 h, and possessed long-term stability of >50 h. This study may pave the way for fabricating non-noble-metal-based cost-effective, efficient and durable electrocatalysts for OER, zinc-air batteries, and beyond.									10	0	0	0	0	0	10			1861-4728	1861-471X		WOS:000579582100001	32929867

The major challenges in these technologies arise due to the poor kinetics of the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and the oxygen evolution reactions (OER), besides the high cost of the catalysts. Attempts to address these issues have led to the development of many novel and inexpensive catalysts as well as newer mechanistic insights, particularly so in the last three-four years when more catalysts have been investigated than ever before. With the growing emphasis on bifunctionality, that is, materials that can facilitate both reduction metal-free materials developed during this period in a single platform, while also directing the and evolution of oxygen, this review is intended to discuss all major families of ORR, OER, and bifunctional catalysts such as metals, alloys, oxides, other chalcogenides, pnictides, and readers to specific and detailed review articles dealing with each family. In addition, each section highlights the latest theoretical and experimental insights that may further improve ORR/OER performances. The bifunctional catalysts being sufficiently new, no consensus appears to have emerged about the efficiencies. Therefore, a statistical analysis of their performances by considering nearly all literature reports that have appeared in this period is presented. The current challenges in rational design of these catalysts as well as probable strategies to improve their performances are presented.									40	2	0	0	1	0	40			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000447355300001	30222309

Here, we demonstrate that the origin of the OER activity in a La(1-x)SrxCoO(3) model perovskite arises from a thin surface layer of Co hydr(oxy)oxide (CoOxHy) that interacts with trace-level Fe species present in the electrolyte, creating dynamically stable active sites. Generation of the hydr(oxy)oxide layer is a consequence of a surface evolution process driven by the A-site dissolution and O-vacancy creation. In turn, this imparts a 10-fold improvement in stability against Co dissolution and a 3-fold increase in the activity-stability factor for CoOxHy/ LSCO when compared to nanoscale Co-hydr(oxy)oxides clusters. Our results suggest new design rules for active and stable perovskite oxide-based OER materials.									68	1	0	0	4	0	66			0002-7863	1520-5126		WOS:000623246000020	33399469	
J	Yang, Siwei; Cheng, Yaxuan; Liu, Huiling; Huang, Xuri								Heteroatom-doped fullerene C-70 as non-metal electrocatalysts for oxygen reduction and oxygen evolution from computational study								DIAMOND AND RELATED MATERIALS				124						108954	10.1016/j.diamond.2022.108954				APR 2022	2022	Here, we report on computational oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) efficiencies of a series of heteroatom-doped fullerene C-70 (X(Cn), with B, N, O or Si as dopant X, replacing five different types of carbon atoms (Cn, n = 1-5) on C-70). It is clarified that the X(Cn) is thermodynamically stable. delta G*OH shows a good linear relationship with delta G(*OOH) and delta G(*O). It is worth noting that the ORR overpotential values of N(C1), N(C2), N(C3) and N(C4) are 0.87 V, 0.75 V, 0.67 V and 0.73 V, respectively, which are all greater than Pt (eta(ORR) = 0.45 V), but it shows that ORR can still be catalyzed. Compared with the pristine C-70, both B and N doping can reduce OER overpotential value and improve OER performance. In particular, N(C4) (eta(OER) = 0.55 V) has the closest overpotential to traditional noble metal OER catalysts such as RuO2 (eta(OER) = 0.42 V), indicating that it can be used as a potential candidate for OER catalysts. According to the volcano plots, the best ORR and OER activities of X(Cn) appear at delta G(*OH) = 0.56 eV and delta G(*O) -delta G(*OH) = 1.78 eV, respectively. This work can provide some clues for the design and discovery of new non-metal carbon-based electrocatalysts.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0925-9635	1879-0062		WOS:000790959600003

Metal-oxygen batteries (M=Li, Na) arise, therefore, as promising alternatives to widely used lithium-ion batteries, due to their high theoretical energy density, which approaches that of gasoline. Although significant progress has been made in recent years, there are still several challenges to overcome to reach the final commercialization of this technology. One of the most limiting and challenging factors is the development of bifunctional cathodes towards oxygen reduction and evolution reactions. In this sense, graphene, which is very promising and tunable, has been widely explored by the research community as a key material for this technology. Herein, a wide literature overview is presented and analyzed with the aim of guiding future research in this field.									12	1	0	0	0	0	12			1864-5631	1864-564X		WOS:000521252700007	31872539

Interface engineering of transition metal-based heterostructures via composition modulation, crystal facet tuning and heteroatom doping has received more attention in improving oxygen electrocatalytic activity. The interface in heterostructures offers great advantages for the electrocatalysis, such as optimizing chemisorption of reaction intermediates, controlling the electron/mass transportation, and preventing active components from aggregating. In this review, we summarize recent progress in the design and synthesis of transition metal-based heterostructures for the oxygen reduction and oxygen evolution. First, the mechanisms and advantages of the interface engineering on oxygen electrocatalysts are briefly introduced. Then, the recent works on the heterostructures for oxygen reduction and oxygen evolution are systematically summarized and discussed. Finally, the challenges and perspectives on future advanced development of transition metal-based heterostructures for the oxygen electrocatalysis are presented.

However, the measured mass spectrometric signals typically do not directly correspond to the partial current density toward the analyte due to mass transport effects. Here, we introduce a mathematical framework, grounded on a mass transport model, to obtain a quantitative and truly dynamic partial current density from a measured mass spectrometer signal by means of deconvolution. Furthermore, it is shown that the time resolution of electrochemistry-mass spectrometry is limited by entropy-driven processes during mass transport to the mass spectrometer. The methodology is validated by comparing the measured impulse responses of hydrogen and oxygen evolution to the model predictions and subsequently applied to uncover dynamic phenomena during hydrogen and oxygen evolution in an acidic electrolyte.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			0003-2700	1520-6882		WOS:000651517700017	33905662

The structure consists of three levels of hierarchy i.e., zero-dimensional nanoparticle with a diameter of about 6 nm, one-dimensional chain, and three-dimensional hollow urchin, respectively. Nanoparticle aggregates of NiCo2O4 (NA-NiCo2O4) were also synthesized by the same procedure in the absence of the hard template. Relative to NA-NiCo2O4, HU-NiCo2O4 features a well-connected three-dimensional porous structure, which is beneficial for diffusion of oxygen.. Consequently, HU-NiCo2O4 displayed superior electrocatalytic activity towards oxygen evolution processes with lower overpotential, higher current density, and higher stability than NA-NiCo2O4.

Here, cotton-based, highly porous electrocatalytic electrodes are introduced with extremely low overpotentials and fast reaction kinetics using metal nanoparticle assembly-driven electroplating. Hydrophobic metal nanoparticles are layer-by-layer assembled with small-molecule linkers onto cotton fibrils to form the conductive seeds for effective electroplating of non-noble metal electrocatalysts. This approach converts insulating cottons to highly electrocatalytic textiles while maintaining their intrinsic 3D porous structure with extremely large surface area without metal agglomerations. To prepare hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrodes, Ni is first electroplated onto the conductive cotton textile (HER electrode), and NiFe is subsequently electroplated onto the Ni-electroplated textile (OER electrode). The resulting HER and OER electrodes exhibit remarkably low overpotentials of 12 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) and 214 mV at 50 mA cm(-2), respectively. The two-electrode water electrolyzer exhibits a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at a low cell voltage of 1.39 V. Additionally, the operational stability of the device is well maintained even at an extremely high current density of 1 A cm(-2) for at least 100 h.									4	0	0	0	1	0	4			1616-301X	1616-3028		WOS:000660402600001

Herein, an amorphous CoSe film electrodeposited on a Ti mesh (a-CoSe/Ti) is demonstrated to exhibit high electro-catalytic activity and stability for both reactions in 1.0 M KOH. It needs overpotentials of 292 and 121 mV to drive 10 mA cm(-2) for OER and HER, respectively.

Herein, we developed a facile chemical solution deposition method to prepare a highly active Co3O4 thin film electrode for OER, showing a low overpotential of 377 mV at 10 mA/cm(2) with good stability. An optimal loading of ethyl cellulose additive in a precursor solution was found to be essential for the morphology control and thus its electrocatalytic activity. Our results also show that the distribution of Co3O4 nanoparticle catalysts on the substrate is crucial in enhancing the inherent OER catalytic performance.									75	6	0	0	5	0	76			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000364726400019	26489005

This requires that development of two photosystems and the oxygen evolution capability occurred very early in the earth's history, and that a presumed phase ot evolution involving non-oxygen evolving photosynthetic organisms took place even earlier. The evolutionary relationships of the reaction center complexes found in all the classes of currently existing organisms have been analyzed using sequence analysis and biophysical measurements. The results indicate that all reaction centers fall into two basic groups, those with pheophytin and a pair of quinones as early acceptors, and those with iron sulfur clusters as early acceptors. No simple linear branching evolutionary scheme can account for the distribution patterns of reaction centers in existing photosynthetic organisms, and lateral transfer of genetic information is considered as a likely possibility. Possible scenarios for the development of primitive reaction centers into the heterodimeric protein structures found in existing reaction centers and for the development of organisms with two linked photosystems are presented.									326	4	5	0	254	0	343			0166-8595	1573-5079		WOS:A1992JP73200003	24408571

Here, we demonstrate a bifunctional CoNiP nanosheet integrated electrode (CoNiP-NIE) to boost HER and replace OER by 5-hydroxymethylfurfural oxidation reaction (HMFOR) to obtain high-valued 2,5-furandicarboxylic acid (FDCA). The as-developed CoNiP-NIE exhibits a constant high Faradaic efficiency more than 82% for HMFOR in a wide potential from 1.40 V to 1.70 V vs. RHE, which stand at the top level among the reported electrocatalysts. Moreover, the low overpotential for HER further indicates its high efficiency in the H2 generation. Based on the bifunctional activity of CoNiP, an electrochemical hydrogen evolution coupled with biomass oxidation device is constructed, which delivers lower voltage (1.46 V) for anode oxidation and higher evolution rate of H-2 (41.2 L h(-1) m(-2)) than water splitting (1.76 V, 16.1 L h(-1) m(-2)).									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000798989400001

The prepared Fe-CoSe2/ NF electrode demands an overpotential of only 220 and 256 mV to attain the current density of 10 and 100 mA cm(-2), respectively. Moreover, the Fe-CoSe2/NF exhibits negligible tafel slope (35.6 mV dec(-1)) and good stability.									11	0	0	0	0	0	11			1572-6657	1873-2569		WOS:000593969600009

Herein, a salt-template strategy is prepared to synthesize nitrogen-doped carbon nanosheets encapsulated with dispersed CoSe2 nanoparticles (CoSe2-NC NSs), while the thickness of CoSe2-NC NSs is only about 3.6 nm. Profiting from the ultrathin morphology, large surface area, and promising electrical conductivity, the CoSe2-NC NSs exhibited excellent electrocatalytic of 10 mA center dot cm(-2) current density at small overpotentials of 247 mV for OER and 75 mV for HER. Not only does the nitrogen-doped carbon matrix effectively avoid self-aggregation of CoSe2 nanoparticles, but it also prevents the corrosion of CoSe2 from electrolytes and shows favorable durability after long-term stability tests. Furthermore, an overall water-splitting system delivers a current density of 10 mA center dot cm(-2) at a voltage of 1.54 V with resultants being both the cathode and anode catalyst in alkaline solutions. This work provides a new way to synthesize efficient and nonprecious bifunctional electrocatalysts for water splitting.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0				1422-0067		WOS:000794370700001	35563630

At present, no single metal oxide can catalyze both oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) with low overpotential between them. Here, the composite concept is employed to address this problem in conjunction with well-defined quantification of the onset of both reactions utilizing thin-film rotating disk electrode technique. This work is built up on the idea of utilizing a good ORR catalyst (e. g. PdO) and a good OER catalyst (e. g. RuO2) in alkaline solution. Four electron mechanism and two electron mechanism are implied for the ORR catalyzed using PdO containing compounds and RuO2, respectively. (C) 2012 The Electrochemical Society.

However current development on LOBs is suffering from unsuitable catalysts. In particular, carbon-based catalysts were found to perform poorly in this system. Here, we show that metal-free mesoporous nitrogen-doped carbons (meso-NdCs) offer highly promising performances in both ORR and OER; they act as bifunctional catalysts, and can be synthesized by a very simple method. The efficient electrocatalytic activity of ORR and OER was used in a LOB cell during discharge and charge, respectively, and the present system showed a lower overpotential comparable to metal-based catalysts in LOB system. Thus, we demonstrate that meso-NdCs act as a new and affordable candidate for the efficient bifunctional oxygen catalysis, therefore can be applied to many energy-related applications.									79	6	0	0	3	0	81			1864-5631	1864-564X		WOS:000352734800006	25739370

STUDIES ON OXYGEN EVOLUTION								INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY				18	6			467	473		10.1016/0360-3199(93)90002-R				JUN 1993	1993	Thin films of electrodeposited nickel - iron alloys containing 15.6 - 38.5 % Fe were obtained on mild steel at 30-degrees-C. The films were uniform, porous and p-type semiconducting. Cyclic voltammograms showed the formation of a single quasireversible redox couple, Ni(III)/Ni(II), on each film electrode in the anodic region (0-0.6 V) in IM KOH. Oxygen evolution studies demonstrated a substantial increase in the electrocatalytic activity of Ni in the presence of 17.9 % Fe additive. The Tafel slopes were 40 +/- 5 mV decade-1. The reaction order with respect to OH- ion concentration was observed to be approximately 2. The results suggest that the oxygen evolution reaction occurs on the oxidized Ni(III) sites on the electrode surface with a mechanism involving an electrochemical adsorption of OH- ions in a fast step and their subsequent electrochemical desorption in the slow step.									48	1	0	0	3	0	48			0360-3199			WOS:A1993LE48700002

Thus, as the key technology barrier, the development of a low-cost and high-performance bifunctional transition metal electrocatalyst toward water splitting is still a challenge. In this work, aiming to enhance electrocatalytic performance, the nickel molybdenum nitride heterostructure nanowire arrays were synthesized on nickel foam (Ni3N-Mo2N/NF) via hydrothermal strategy followed by a direct nitridation, from which the heterostructure nanowire was achieved. The self-supporting Ni3N-Mo2N/NF electrodes exhibits very low over potentials of 66 and 252 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) for the hydrogen evolution reaction and oxygen evolution reaction, respectively. When the cathode and anode were both Ni3N-Mo2N/NF, a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) was achieved with only 1.55 V.

J	Jing, Minghua; Qin, Ye; Shi, Quan; Liu, Jianguo; Yan, Chuanwei								A new insight into electrode processes of vanadium redox flow battery by thermo-electro-chemistry method								JOURNAL OF ENERGY STORAGE				14				163	167		10.1016/j.est.2017.10.008				DEC 2017	2017	In this study, the electrochemical reactions along with the corresponding temperature change in the vanadium acid solutions have been investigated by the thermo-electro-chemistry method for the first time. It turned out that the electrochemical oxidation of V(II) and reduction of V(V) are both exothermic, so substantial heat could be created by the electrochemical reaction during the discharging process, which may adversely affect the stability and efficiency of the VRFB. The temperature change characters of different electrochemical redox reactions imply that lower temperature may be advantageous for the discharge process, while higher temperature is helpful to the charge process. Besides, oxygen evolution as a main side reaction along with the oxidation of V(IV) is seen to occur at a relatively lower potential and highly depends on the vanadium ion concentration in the electrolyte. Moreover, it is found that the V(III)/V(IV) solution is more likely to suffer from oxygen evolution in oxidation processes and hydrogen evolution in reduction processes than pure V(IV) and V(III) solutions. These results demonstrate that the thermo-electro-chemistry method shows great significance and application prospect in investigating the electrode kinetics and will be helpful to optimize the work conditions and related components in a VRFB.

The formed 1D, 2D, and 3D Co3O4 were systematically probed using a structure sensitive electrochemical oxygen evolution reaction (OER), revealing that the 2D nanosheets exhibited higher catalytic activities in contrast to the 1D and 3D Co3O4, due to their high electrochemically active surface area and rich oxygen deficiencies. This study also showed that there was a tradeoff between the 2D and 3D Co3O4 in terms of OER activity and stability.									56	2	0	0	0	0	56			1359-7345	1364-548X		WOS:000463755900010	30849132

Herein, a trifunctional electrocatalyst is synthesized by anchoring individually dispersed Co atoms on N and S codoped hollow carbon spheres (CoSA/N,S-HCS), which exhibits outstanding catalytic activity and stability for the oxygen reduction reaction, oxygen evolution reaction, and hydrogen evolution reaction. When equipped in liquid or flexible solid-state rechargeable Zn-air batteries, CoSA/N,S-HCS endows them with high power and energy density as well as excellent long-term cycling stability, outperforming benchmark batteries based on a commercial Pt/C + RuO2 dual catalyst system. Furthermore, a self-driven water splitting system powered by flexible Zn-air batteries is demonstrated using CoSA/N,S-HCS as the sole catalyst, giving a high H-2 evolution rate of 184 mmol h(-1). The state-of-art experimental characterizations and theoretical calculations reveal synergistic cooperation between atomically dispersed Co-N-4 active sites, nearby electron-donating S dopants, and the unique carbon support to single-atom catalysts (SACs). This work demonstrates a general strategy to design various multifunctional SAC systems with a tailored coordination environment.									124	3	0	0	9	0	124			1614-6832	1614-6840		WOS:000587349700001

However, their successful utilization of hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and the reaction of overall water-splitting is rather unexplored. Herein, presented is a crystalline cobalt phosphate, Co-3(OH)(2)(HPO4)(2), structurally related to the mineral lazulite, as an efficient precatalyst for OER, HER, and water electrolysis in alkaline media. During both electrochemical OER and HER, the Co-3(OH)(2)(HPO4)(2) nanostructure was completely transformed in situ into porous amorphous CoOx(OH) films that mediate efficient OER and HER with extremely low overpotentials of only 182 and 87 mV, respectively, at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2). When assemble as anode and cathode in a two-electrode alkaline electrolyzer, unceasing durability over 10 days is achieved with a final cell voltage of 1.54 V, which is superior to the recently reported effective bifunctional electrocatalysts. The strategy to achieve more active sites for oxygen and hydrogen generation via in situ oxidation or reduction from a well-defined inorganic material provides an opportunity to develop cost-effective and efficient electrocatalysts for renewable energy technologies.									102	1	0	0	2	0	102			1616-301X	1616-3028		WOS:000484251200013

However, the anodic reaction of oxygen evolution has a high overpotential and low value products are obtained. Therefore, the exploration of decoupling hydrogen evolution and oxygen evolution and coupling with a value-added anodic reaction has received tremendous attention. Herein, we employ an in situ electrochemical anion-oxidation strategy to synthesize cobalt oxyhydroxide (CoOOH) nanosheets from cobalt carbonate hydroxide nanoarrays. With the use of CoOOH nanosheets as the anodic electrocatalyst in a hybrid water electrolyzer with 5-hydroxymethylfurfural, a high value product of 2,5-furandicarboxylic acid can be produced on the anode with similar to 100% conversion, similar to 100% selectivity and similar to 100% Faraday efficiency at an operating voltage as low as 1.423 V.									12	0	0	0	2	0	12			1463-9262	1463-9270		WOS:000634559500023

Improving the intrinsic activity of the OER and increasing the number of active sites are two strategies used to enhance the OER performance. However, combining these two strategies to improve the catalytic activity of the OER for CoO catalysts has rarely been reported. Herein, we introduce a simple strategy to prepare CoO for the OER by fine tuning the calcination temperature of the Co(OH)2 precursor. The physical and chemical characterizations of these materials confirm the formation of oxygen vacancies and porous structures. Among the Co-based oxides prepared at different temperatures (300-600 ?), CoO prepared at 500 ? shows the best OER performance. The intrinsic catalytic activity and number of active sites of the CoO nanoflowers are also improved, which is attributed to the formation of oxygen vacancies and porous structures. This work introduces a simple strategy to improve the catalytic activity of the OER for transition metal-based oxides by improving their intrinsic catalytic activity and simultaneously increasing the number of active sites.

Herein, we developed a facile and cost-effective strategy to prepare a cobalt and nitrogen codoped three-dimensional (3D) graphene catalyst through inserting carbon nanospheres into the interlayers of graphene sheets. The catalyst exhibited not only excellent ORR performance but also excellent OER performance, and both were greatly enhanced by the insertion of carbon nanospheres. Its activities for the ORR/OER ranked among the best for doped carbon catalysts thus far reported. Its overall oxygen electrode activity parameter (Delta E) was as low as 0.807 V, which was much lower than that of Pt/C, and made it comparable with the best nonprecious metal based catalysts to date. Furthermore, the catalyst exhibited excellent stability toward ORR and OER, making it a new noble-metal-free bifunctional catalyst for future applications in the fields of alternative energy conversion and storage systems.									86	2	0	0	5	0	86			2168-0485			WOS:000380869800008

Herein, we reported a three-dimensional (3D) porous nanosphere Mn-NiCo2S4/NF catalyst for OER. As a result, the simple Mn doping strategy results in good electrocatalytic performance and outstanding stability. During the OER, the Mn-NiCo2S4/NF only needs a small overpotential of 220 mV (40 mV lower than pure NiCo2S4/NF) to achieve the current density of 10 mA cm(-2), which is mainly due to a large number of exposed active sites and adequate pathways for mass diffusion and oxygen gas release. Moreover, Mn doping optimizes the electronic structure and thus facilitates electron transport, leading to superior electrocatalytic performance. The catalyst exhibits incredible corrosion resistance in 1 M KOH solution for 60 h or more. This work provides a valuable method to synthesize a low cost, high-efficiency, and corrosion resistant transition metal electrocatalyst for oxygen evolution using heteroatom doping strategy.

X-ray diffraction and transmission electron microscopy show that ultrafine and narrow distributed Pt/Ir-3(IrO2)(7) nanocomposites are formed. Electrochemical measurements demonstrate that among the series of catalysts studied, Pt/Ir-3(Iro(2))(7) catalyst possesses the highest electrochemical surface area (24.74 m(2) g(-1)) and the highest activity towards oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) (21.71 mA mg(-1) at 0.85 V). Meanwhile, considerably high activity towards oxygen evolution reaction (OER) (42.35 mA mg(-1) at 1.55V) is also observed for Pt/Ir-3(IrO2)(7) catalyst.

The nanoflowers are assembled by dozens of 2D nanoplates. Each nanoplate is formed by numerous Zn-doped CoO nanoparticles. Zn-doped CoO catalyst is highly efficient for electrocatalytic water oxidation with a low overpotential (eta=293 mV at j=10 mA cm(-2)) and long-term stability, which is comparable to the commercial RuO2 catalysts in alkaline media. The 3D hierarchical structure provides abundant surface catalytic sites, while the density functional theory (DFT) calculations show that the Zn doping is also beneficial for the enhanced oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activities. This series of novel hierarchical porous nanoflowers is a promising anode material for water oxidation.									14	1	0	0	1	0	14			1867-3880	1867-3899		WOS:000460471000012

Herein, we demonstrate the synthesis of spinel Co3O4 mesoporous nanosheets aggregation with tunable Ov by a simple phosphorus (P) doping strategy. It is found that a trade-off between Ov and electronic conductivity plays an important role in improving OER electrocatalytic activity. The optimized Co3O4-xP0.15 electrocatalyst delivers a current density of 20 mA cm(-2) in alkaline media within a small overpotential of only 338 mV, which is much lower than the corresponding Co3O4 (395 mV) and the commercial RuO2 (368 mV) catalysts. The Tafel slope is 52 mV dec(-1) and the overpotential gives negligible increase even through 8 h OER at 10 mA cm(-2). The superior OER catalytic activity is mainly attributed to the 2D mesoporous nanosheets (rich active sites) and appropriate Ov (fast electrons transfer). This work provides a simple and effective strategy to control Ov concentration in spinel electrocatalysts for enhancing water oxidation capability. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

A well-defined rhombic dodecahedral structure with abundant oxygen vacancies was constructed based on the coprecipitation, carbonization, oxidation, and partial reduction process. The proposed synthetic method is effective for fabricating a bimetallic hierarchical structure with a rough surface and a moderately controlled electronic structure, which significantly facilitates charge and mass transfer and appropriately exposes the active sites for efficient electrocatalysis. Subsequently, the as-obtained defect-rich Fe-doped Co3O4 nanoparticles was found to be a superior OER electrocatalyst, with a small overpotential of 318 mV required for a current density of 10 mA cm(-2), a low Tafel slope of 76.8 mV dec(-1), a turnover frequency of 0.1553 s(-1) at an overpotential of 370 mV, and outstanding long-term durability in 1.0 M KOH. The proposed strategy will offer a new approach in the design and development of electrochemically active non-noble materials as advanced catalysts for various energy storage and conversion applications.									21	0	0	0	2	0	21			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000707037200067

Iridium (Ir) nanodots with a typical diameter of 2 nm were colloid chemically deposited on ruthenium oxide (RuO2) nanoparticles as oxygen evolution catalyst and on platinum (Pt) nanorods to yield bifunctional oxygen catalysts. The stepwise synthesis allows a higher control of the composite nanoparticles morphology and thus their activity and stability. The stability toward oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) was studied with cyclic voltammetry. Structural characterization was carried out with X-ray diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) spectroscopy before and after the stability protocols. Ir nanodots as well as Ir-decorated RuO2 nanoparticles were found to be less stable toward the OER stability protocol than pure RuO2 nanoparticles. Bifunctional catalysts made of Ir deposited on Pt nanorods showed different behavior than the individual components. Concerning the OER, the stability decreased compared to unsupported Ir (monometallic OER catalyst), whereas improved stability was observed for the ORR in comparison to pure Pt nanorods (monometallic ORR catalyst).									45	0	0	0	0	0	45			1932-7447			WOS:000368754700036

In this paper, we report the synthesis of self-supported VOB-Co3O4/NF nanowire arrays directly grown on Ni foam, which can serve as a trifunctional catalyst for producing hydrogen and oxygen by electrolyzing water in alkaline media or producing hydrogen via hydrolyzing alkaline NaBH4 solution. The engineered boron and oxygen defects in Co3O4 nanowires prove to effectively modulate their electronic structure leading to the increased electrical conductivity and create a large quantity of electroactive sites. The resulting self-supported VOB-Co3O4/NF electrode delivers a current density of 50 mA cm(-2) at overpotentials of 184 mV for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and 315 mV for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in 1.0 M KOH with excellent stability and durability. The VOB-Co3O4/NF as both cathode and anode requires 1.67 V to achieve a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) for overall water splitting reaction. Besides, VOB-Co3O4/NF presents much higher hydrogen generation rate (HGR) of 7055 mL min(-1) gcatalyst(-1) with activation energy (Ea) of ca. 29.7 kJ mol(-1). for hydrolytic dehydrogenation of alkaline NaBH4 solution, outperforming most of the reported non-noble metal-based catalysts and even precious metal catalysts.									44	2	0	0	4	0	45			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000600984500002

The commercialization of this technology, however, is hindered by a variety of technical hurdles, including low obtainable capacity, poor energy efficiency, and limited cycle life of the electrodes, especially the cathode (or oxygen) electrode. During the last decade, tremendous efforts have been devoted to the development of new cathode materials. Among them, perovskite oxides have attracted much attention due to the extraordinary tunability of their compositions, structures, and functionalities (e.g., high electrical conductivities and catalytic activities), demonstrating the potential to achieve superior battery performance. This article focuses on the recent advances of perovskite oxides as the electrode materials in nonaqueous lithium-oxygen batteries. The electrochemical mechanisms of oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) on the surface of perovskite oxides are first summarized. Then, the effect of nanostructure and morphology on ORR and OER activities is reviewed, from nanoparticles to hierarchical porous structures. Moreover, perovskite-oxide-based composite electrodes are discussed, highlighting the enhancement in electrical conductivities, catalytic activities, and durability under realistic operating conditions. Finally, the remaining challenges and new directions for achieving rational design of perovskite oxides for nonaqueous lithium-oxygen batteries are outlined and discussed.									103	7	0	0	2	0	104			1614-6832	1614-6840		WOS:000404751700016

Here, we highlight a new halogen-chlorine (Cl)-anion doping strategy to boost the OER activity of perovskite oxides. As a proof-of-concept, proper Cl doping at the oxygen site of LaFeO3 (LFO) perovskite can induce multiple favorable characteristics for catalyzing the OER, including rich oxygen vacancies, increased electrical conductivity and enhanced Fe-O covalency. Benefiting from these factors, the LaFeO2.9-delta Cl0.1 (LFOCl) perovskite displays significant intrinsic activity enhancement by a factor of around three relative to its parent LFO. This work uncovers the effect of Cl-anion doping in perovskites on promoting OER performance and paves a new way to design highly efficient electrocatalysts.

However, the electrocatalytic performance of Co-MOF-derived composite (Co@NC) for oxygen evolution remains unsatisfactory owing to its insufficient active sites and the detachment of Co nanoparticles. As catalytic reactions are mostly dominated by surface atoms, it is important to artificially control the surface catalytic sites of Co@NC composites to obtain highly efficient electrocatalysts. Herein, we proposed an in-situ electrochemical treatment to change the surface of Co nanoparticles to catalytic Co3+/Co4+ couple exchange states, thus obtaining a core/shell structure consisting of conductive Co metal and a highly active CoOOH layer. To achieve this, pyrolyzed Co@NC composites were subjected to a two-step in-situ electrochemical treatment; in the first step, the naturally formed inactive oxidation states were removed, and in the second step, the core/shell-structured nanoparticles were formed. The electrochemically designed Co@NC composite exhibited excellent electrocatalytic reaction with desirable overpotential (eta(10) = similar to 320 mV) and Tafel slope (78-80 mV.dec(-1)), in addition to long-term durability.									5	0	0	0	1	0	5			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000647735100002

Using site-directed mutagenesis we have produced the mutant W167S which lies in loop C of CP 97. This strain exhibited a 75% loss in oxygen evolution activity and grew extremely slowly in the absence of glucose. Examination of normalized oxygen evolution traces indicated that the mutant was susceptible to photoinactivation. Analysis of the variable fluorescence yield indicated that the mutant accumulated very few functional PS If reaction centers. This was confirmed by immunoblotting experiments. Interestingly, when W167S was grown in the presence of 20 mu M DCMU, the mutant continued to exhibit these defects. These results indicate that tryptophan 167 in loop C of CP 47 is important for the assembly and stability of the PS II reaction center.									12	0	0	0	10	0	12			0167-4412	1573-5028		WOS:A1996VY66300014	8980503

Among promising candidates, the layered double perovskitePrBaCo(2)O(6-) (PBC)has been identified as the most active perovskite electrocatalyst for OER in alkaline media. For a single transition metal oxide catalyst, the addition of Fe enhances its electrocatalytic performance towards OER. To understand the role of Fe, herein, Fe is incorporated in PBC in different ratios, which yielded PrBaCo2(1-x)Fe2xCo6- (x = 0, 0.2 and 0.5). Fe-doped PBCF's demonstrate enhanced OER activities and stabilities. Operando X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) revealed that Co is more stable in a lower oxidation state upon Fe incorporation by establishing charge stability. Hence, the degradation of Co is inhibited such that the perovskite structure is prolonged under the OER conditions, which allows it to serve as a platform for the oxy(hydroxide) layer formation. Overall, our findings underline synergetic effects of incorporating Fe into Co-based layered double perovskite in achieving a higher activity and stability during oxygen evolution reaction.									15	0	0	0	2	0	15			2073-4344			WOS:000465012800047

However, the ideal electrocatalysts are noble metal based catalysts. Their high cost and scarcity in earth seriously restrict the large deployments. NiFe-based materials have attracted great attention in recent years due to their excellent catalytic properties for OER and HER. Nevertheless, their conductivity and electrochemical stability at high current density are unsatisfactory, resulting in ineffective water splitting due to high impedance and low stability. Recently, a series of catalysts coating NiFe-based materials on 3D nickel foam were found to be extremely stable under the circumstance of high current density. In this review, we summarized the recent advances of NiFe-based materials on nickel foam for OER and HER, respectively, and further provided the perspectives for their future development.

A key issue in the WE is to develop suitable catalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), where a relatively large energy loss occurs. The Ir-doped NiCo2O4 catalysts exhibit the formation of a solid solution and a porous nanostructure. The oxygen vacancies formed by Ir doping can enhance the electrocatalytic activity for the OER owing to increased electrical conductivity and tunable adsorption energies of OH- and H2O.

Herein, an electrode composed of NiCo2O4 nanoneedle and molybdenum carbide coated on carbon cloth (NiCo2O4/Mo2C/CC) is prepared based on the hydrothermal process. The CC enhances the electric conduction ability of the system. The heterojunction between Mo2C and NiCo2O4 makes NiCo2O4 nanoneedle diminished and leads to production of richened oxygen vacancies. Therefore, NiCo2O4/Mo2C/CC presents the low overpotential of 120 mV for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and 220 mV for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) at 10 mA cm(-2) used in water splitting. Meanwhile, NiCo2O4/Mo2C/CC shows remarkable oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) performance. With NiCo2O4/Mo2C/CC used as catalyst in air cathode, the prepared Zn-air battery exhibits a capacity of 778 mAh g(-1) and an energy density of 104 mW cm(-2), showing promising applications to replace the expensive rare-metal catalysts.									4	0	0	0	1	0	4			0379-6779			WOS:000697682600002

Since the catalyst in the air-electrode must simultaneously catalyze oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), mass transfer structure of the air-electrode catalyst would significantly affect the ZAB performance. A facile selectively etching strategy is therefore proposed to in situ adjusting the mass transfer structure of the CoFe OER/ORR bi functional catalyst encapsulated in graphene cage. This graphene encapsulated CoFe catalyst with optimized mass transfer channel exhibits superior OER and ORR activity to IrO2 and Pt/C, respectively. The corresponding ZAB performance is therefore tripled compared with that equipped with Pt/C-IrO2 catalysts in terms of maximum power density (206 mW/cm(2)). Together with the satisfied stability, this facilely synthesized CoFe catalyst shows promising application potential in metal-air batteries. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

Water oxidation can take place in neutral electrolyte operating with modest overpotential. The doping of other transitional metal cations affords mix valences and thus more intimate electronic interactions for reversible chemisorption of dioxygen molecules.

Herein, we investigate the crystallization mechanism of bismuth ruthenate pyrochlore (BRO), a well-known active OER catalyst, in a hot oxygen-saturated alkaline reactor. A dissolution-recrystallization mechanism is proposed. From this insight, BRO is epitaxially grown onto bismuth titanate pyrochlore (BTO) seed nanoparticles. This original material displays metallic electrical conductivity (> 1 S cm(-1)) for a low ruthenium loading (< 10 wt %). The activity and durability of BRO/BTO toward the OER in acidic and alkaline conditions are evaluated and compared to unsupported BRO pyrochlore and benchmark catalysts. Pyrochlore BRO displays exceptionally high OER activity but relatively low durability, making it not yet a suitable catalyst for the OER. More interestingly, no trade-off between the activity and stability is observed as the deposition of BRO onto BTO enhances both the activity and the durability of the catalyst.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2574-0962			WOS:000849818400001

By using a compressed sensing approach, we here identify descriptors in the form of algebraic expressions of surface-derived features for predicting adsorption enthalpies of oxygen evolution reaction (OER) intermediates at doped RuO2 and IrO2 electrocatalysts. Our descriptors significantly outperform previously highlighted single descriptors both in terms of accuracy and computational cost. Compared to standard scaling relations that employ the oxygen adsorption enthalpy as a unique reactivity descriptor, our analysis reveals that the consideration of features related to the local charge transfer leads to significantly improved refined scaling relations. These allow us to screen for improved OER electrocatalysts with an uncertainty in the theoretical overpotential similar to the expected intrinsic DFT error of 0.2 V.									31	0	0	0	2	0	30			2155-5435			WOS:000611450000023

Here we report a robust and highly active electrocatalyst that is constructed by deposition of the ternary metal phosphide FeMnP onto graphene-protected nickel foam by metal-organic chemical vapor deposition from a single source precursor. FeMnP exhibits high electrocatalytic activity toward both the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Utilizing FeMnP/GNF as both the anode and the cathode for overall water splitting, a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) is achieved at a cell voltage of as low as 1.55 V with excellent stability. Complementary density functional theory (DFT) calculations suggest that facets exposing both Fe and Mn sites are necessary to achieve high HER activity. The present work provides a facile strategy for fabricating highly efficient electrocatalysts from earth-abundant materials for overall water splitting.									91	4	0	0	3	0	93			2211-2855	2211-3282		WOS:000408878200047

Homogeneous dispersion and reducing size to nanoscale by modulating the combinations of metal and nonmetal P would benefit to explore their intrinsic activities. Based on size-confined synthesis strategy, nanostructured bimetallic phosphide NiFeP with dimensions of several nanometers has been synthesized via controlled pyrolysis of a green organophosphorus source. The highly dispersed Ni0.65Fe0.35P electrocatalyst exhibited relatively low oxygen evolution reaction overpotential of 270 mV while supporting the current density of 10 mA/cm(2) (without iR-drop corrections). Additionally, current density of 200 mA/cm(2) at overpotential of 500 mV was achieved in alkaline solutions, which was 4-fold and 5-fold OER activity higher (eta = 500 mV) than their single-metal counterparts Ni2P and FeP, respectively, and even better than a conventional method compound and noble metal benchmark.									36	3	0	0	1	0	36			2168-0485			WOS:000434491600003

We have fabricated a self-supporting electrode by decorating CeO2 on Co-Mn-S nanosheets grown on nickel foam (CeO2/Co-Mn-S/NF). As-prepared material shows preeminent electrocatalytic activity toward OER, with minor overpotential (239 mV at 10 mA cm(-2)) and Tafel slope (93.2 mV dec(-1)). Particularly, CeO2/Co-Mn-S/NF exhibits small charge transfer resistance, revealing quick Faradic process and favorable OER kinetics. Moreover, during uninterrupted water oxidation process, CeO2/Co-Mn-S/NF remains long-term stability. The strategy of decorating CeO2 on Co-Mn-S nanosheets opens a new perspective for designing highly efficient electrocatalysts toward OER. (C) 2022 Elsevier B.V.

Oxygen defect engineering has been reported as an effective approach to regulate the OER activity of transition metal oxides. Generating oxygen defects in a controllable manner, however, remains a challenging task, and the impact of oxygen defects on the OER kinetics still requires further investigation. Herein, taking the PrBa0.5Sr0.5Co1.5Fe0.5O5+delta (PBSCF) perovskite thin film as a model material, we generate oxygen vacancies with various concentrations in the material by Ar and H-2 plasma treatment. Electrochemical tests showed that the OER activity of PBSCF was significantly boosted with addition of oxygen vacancies. In addition, the pH dependence test showed that oxygen defect formation in PBSCF leads to decoupled proton and electron transfer in the OER process. The surface adsorption characteristics modified by oxygen defects are believed to be the reason for enhanced performance and modified reaction kinetics. In addition, we applied plasma processing to the powder material. At a current density of 35 mA cm(-2), the overpotential of the obtained defective PBSCF powder is 90 mV lower than that of commercialized IrO2 catalysts, suggesting its good OER performance at high current density. The methodology used in this work can be generally applied to understanding and controlling anionic defects in other oxide, sulphide and phosphide catalysts for a variety of energy and environmental applications.									36	1	0	0	4	0	36			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000538143000032

In this work, manganese cobalt spinel oxides with a general formula of MnxCo3-xO4 (x = 0, 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2) were synthesised via a soft chemistry method. Non-equilibrium mixed powder compositions were produced, resulting in high electrocatalytic activity. The oxygen evolution reaction was evaluated in an alkaline medium (1 M KOH). It was shown that the addition of Mn (up to x <= 1) to the cubic Co3O4 phase results in an increase of the electrocatalytic performance. The lowest overpotential was obtained for the composition designated as MnCo2O4, which exhibited a dual-phase structure (similar to 30% Co3O4 + 70% Mn1.4Co1.6O4): the benchmark current density of 10 mA cm(-2) was achieved at the relatively low overpotential of 327 mV. The corresponding Tafel slope was determined to be similar to 79 mV dec(-1). Stabilities of the electrodes were tested for 25 h, showing degradation of the MnCo2O4 powder, but no degradation, or even a slight activation for other spinels. (C) 2020 The Author(s).

However, conventional electrode materials often show high overpotential and low conductivity. To solve this problem, we fabricate a NiMo(x)Co(2-x)layered double hydroxide (LDH)/Ni foam (NF) product through a facile hydrothermal route. The as-prepared NiMo-Co-LDH/NF catalyst possesses an overpotential of 123 mV for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) at 10 mA cm(-2)and 279 mV for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) at 20 mA cm(-2). The as obtained product exhibits excellent overall water splitting performances. Meanwhile, as the electrode material for supercapacitor, it delivers high specific capacitance and excellent cyclic performance. The asymmetric supercapacitor assembled with NiMoCo-LDH/NF//active carbon exhibits 93% of its initial capacity after 8000 cycles.									53	3	0	0	2	0	54			2095-8226	2199-4501		WOS:000570074300001

Herein, we report the fabrication of three different metal phosphates, e. g. Co-phosphate (CoPO), Ni-phosphate (NiPO), and Ni-Co-phosphate (NiCoPO) using the corresponding metal sources and phosphoric acid as a phosphorus source under hydrothermal conditions without using any structure-directing agent. Since the as-prepared metal-based phosphates exhibit high surface area with good interparticle porosity and contain transition metals in the material frameworks, these materials have been investigated for electrocatalytic oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Among the three metal phosphates, the as-synthesized CoPO catalyst shows efficient electrocatalytic activity toward OER, with an overpotential of 350 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) in 1.0 M KOH solution and a relatively low Tafel slope of 60.7 mV dec(-1). The good electrocatalytic performance of CoPO is attributed to its higher specific surface area and pore volume compared to other two catalysts. The CoPO-modified electrode also shows a high stability up to 15 h at a constant potential of 1.58 V, suggesting its promising future for OER catalysis.									65	1	0	0	2	0	64			1867-3880	1867-3899		WOS:000512470000001

The resulting nanocarbons can serve as model catalysts to investigate the structural effect on the evolution and chemical nature of oxygen functional groups for oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. We studied in situ reactions and characterization data and found that the initial existence of oxygen-containing groups on a catalyst surface had a low contribution to the catalytic performance. The active oxygen species can be generated promptly in situ by the chemisorption of O-2 under the reaction conditions and involved in catalytic dehydrogenation process following a redox mechanism. For different hybridized nanostructures, the same types of generated active oxygen groups show different catalytic capabilities, which can be regulated by the sp(2)-hybridized carbon fraction of nanodiamond. The ketonic carbonyl groups formed on graphitic onion-like carbon surface are more active and can improve the selectivity to alkenes significantly compared with the initial nanodiamond and traditional carbon nanotubes.									24	3	0	0	1	0	24			1867-3880	1867-3899		WOS:000340574600021

Therefore, developing an alternative anodic reaction with accelerating kinetics to produce value-added chemicals, especially coupled with HER, is of great importance. Now, a thermodynamically more favorable primary amine (-CH2-NH2) electrooxidation catalyzed by NiSe nanorod arrays in water is reported to replace OER for enhancing HER. The increased H-2 production can be obtained at cathode; meanwhile, a variety of aromatic and aliphatic primary amines are selectively electrooxidized to nitriles with good yields at the anode. Mechanistic investigations suggest that Ni-II/Ni-III may serve as the redox active species for the primary amines transformation. Hydrophobic nitrile products can readily escape from aqueous electrolyte/electrode interface, avoiding the deactivation of the catalyst and thus contributing to continuous gram-scale synthesis.									181	14	0	0	14	0	183			1433-7851	1521-3773		WOS:000445445700028	30118157

Herein, facile and scalable hydrothermal synthesis of bifunctional electrocatalyst of polyoxometalate anchored zinc cobalt sulfide nanowire on Ni-foam (NF) for overall water splitting is reported for the first time. The electrochemical analysis of POM@ZnCoS/NF displays significantly low HER and OER overpotentials of 170/337 and 200/300 mV to attain a current density of 10/40 and 20/50 mA cm(-2), respectively, demonstrating the notable performance of POM@ZnCoS/NF toward H-2 and O-2 evolution reaction in alkaline medium. Additionally, the electrolyzer consisting of the POM@ZnCoS/NF anode and cathode shows an appealing potential of 1.56 V to deliver 10 mA cm(-2) current density for overall water splitting. The high electrocatalytic activity of the POM@ZnCoS/NF is attributed to modulation of the electronic and chemical properties, increment of the electroactive sites and electrochemically active surface area of the zinc cobalt sulfide nanowires due to the anchorage of polyoxometalate nanoparticles. These results demonstrate the advantage of the polyoxometalate incorporation strategy for the design of cost-effective and highly competent bifunctional catalysts for complete water splitting.									20	0	0	0	1	0	20			1616-301X	1616-3028		WOS:000689683800001

Although the deposition of metals is still the main goal in the most metals electroplating, the applicability of these byproducts might be an interesting field which is not explored in detail so far. In this work, the significance of water splitting reaction in clean energy production, employing NiFe hydroxides formed during the metals electrodeposition, is demonstrated for oxygen evolution reaction. The synthetized materials are composites of three components easily prepared in one-step by means of electrodeposition. Specifically, a granular NiFe alloy is obtained over which local pH variation and chloride presence induce the formation of a layered double hydroxide structure. The study of the influence of solution composition, deposition time, and deposition potential on the catalytic properties of the composites with respect to the oxygen evolution reaction are analyzed. Deposition times of few seconds, deposition potentials in the range -1.4 to -1.6 V vs. Ag/AgCl/KCl3M, and solutions containing Fe(II), Ni(II) and high chloride concentrations, lead to the best catalysts, showing an eta(10 mA cm 2) about 0.280 V.

Strong acid electrolytes are desirable for many implementations of these technologies, although the deployment of such device designs is often hampered by the lack of non-precious-metal oxygen evolution electrocatalysts, with Ir-based oxides comprising the only known catalysts that exhibit stable activity at low overpotential. During our exploration of the Mn-Sb-O system for precious-metal-free electrocatalysts, we discovered that Mn can be incorporated into the rutile oxide structure at much higher concentrations than previously known, and that these Mn-rich rutile alloys exhibit great catalytic activity with current densities exceeding 50 mA cm(-2) at 0.58 V overpotential and catalysis onset at 0.3 V overpotential. While this activity does not surpass that of IrO2, Pourbaix analysis reveals that the Mn-Sb rutile oxide alloys have the same or better thermodynamic stability under operational conditions. By combining combinatorial composition, structure, and activity mapping with synchrotron X-ray absorption measurements and first principles materials chemistry calculations, we provide a comprehensive understanding of these oxide alloys and identify the critical role of Sb in stabilizing the trivalent Mn octahedra that have been shown to be effective oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalysts.									54	2	0	0	3	0	54			2155-5435			WOS:000453491100001

Nanoscale											10.1039/d2nr04880a				2022-Oct-27	2022	Single-atom catalysts (SACs) are promising as efficient electrocatalysts for clean energy technologies such as fuel cells, water splitting, and metal-air batteries. Still, the unsatisfactory loading density and stability of the catalytic active centers limit their applications. Herein, a doping strategy is explored to achieve highly efficient and stable SACs for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The stability, electronic structures, and ORR/OER overpotentials of S-doped transition metal-nitrogen-carbon SAC structures were investigated using first-principles calculation methods. An intrinsic descriptor linking the intrinsic properties of catalysts and the catalytic activity was established for screening the best SACs. The theoretical predictions are well consistent with the experimental results, which provide a theoretical basis for understanding the catalytic mechanism and an approach for the rational design of SACs for clean energy conversion and storage.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0				2040-3372		MEDLINE:36301010	36301010

Particularly, the bifunctional ORR/OER catalysts are core components in rechargeable metal-air batteries, which have shown great promise in achieving "carbon emissions peak and carbon neutrality" goals. However, the sluggish ORR and OER kinetics at the oxygen cathode significantly hinder the performance of metal-air batteries. Although noble metal-based catalysts have been widely employed in accelerating the kinetics and improving the bifunctionality, their scarcity and high cost have limited their deployment in the market. In this review, we will discuss the ORR and OER mechanisms, propose the principles for bifunctional electrocatalysts design, and present the recent progress of the state-of-the-art bifunctional catalysts, with the focus on non-noble metal-based materials to replace the noble metal catalysts in Zn-air batteries. The perspectives for the future R&D of bifunctional electrocatalysts will be provided toward high-performance Zn-air batteries at the end of this paper.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0				2073-4344		WOS:000846077700001		
J	Wu, Jingjing; Zhao, Huining; Tang, Xin								The regulation mechanism of V-shaped 103 nano-twin grain boundary on OER performance of rutile RuO2								APPLIED SURFACE SCIENCE				578						151900	10.1016/j.apsusc.2021.151900		NOV 2021		MAR 15 2022	2022	During the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), surface oxygen adsorption plays a crucial role in electrocatalysis. The stability of surface adsorption is closely related to the surface morphology of the catalyst. As one of the Vshaped nanotwins, 103 nano-twin grain boundary (103-TGB) has a special roof structure, which results in the presence of double dangling-O atoms at the junction of 103-TGB with (110) surface. In contrast to the ideal RuO2, the d-band center of Ru atoms located on the surface of 103-TGB is shifted to the Fermi level by 1.66 eV. Moreover, the key intermediates, namely *OH, *O, and *OOH, have suitable adsorption energies, providing a lower overpotential of OER (I(over cap)center dot(OER)), via adsorbate evolving mechanism (AEM), of just 0.45 eV. Therefore, the OER via AEM is strongly focused on site 02 with double dangling-O atoms, revealing a synergistic effect due to the presence of both the 103-TGB defect and (110) surface.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000729879600002

In this study, the oxygen plasma-activated hybrid structure of Ni-Fe Prussian blue analogue (PBA) interconnected by carbon nanotubes (O-CNT/NiFe) is reported as a highly effective electrocatalytic material for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The electrocatalytic performance is significantly influenced by different mass ratios of CNTs to Ni-Fe PBA. Benefiting from the conductive and oxygen plasma-activated CNTs as well as ordered and distributed metal sites in the framework, the optimized O-CNT/NiFe 1:18 exhibits a competitive overpotential of 279 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) and a low Tafel slope of 42.8 mV dec(-1) in 1.0 M KOH. Furthermore, the composite shows superior durability for at least 100 h. These results suggest that the O-CNT/NiFe 1:18 possesses promising potential as a highly active electrocatalyst.									17	1	0	0	3	0	17			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000575557800018	32845608

Here, we fabricate component tunable rutile-anatase TiO2/reduced graphene oxide (RGO) nanocomposites with high OER activity which exhibit a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at an overpotential of 283 mV. The performance is superior to the previous reported TiO2 (600 mV) and comparable with the leading results of other active materials. The catalytic mechanism is suggested according to our experimental results that the interactions between rutile and anatase, as well as RGO and TiO2 result in the enhancement of adsorption of hydroxyl. Such an adsorption is advantageous to provide a surface reaction environment and reduce the activation energy of the electrochemical process, resulting in the best OER performance. This work should stimulate the design of more materials for the improvement of OER activity.									11	0	0	0	0	0	11			2199-692X			WOS:000452398900004

Herein, we report on the fabrication of the urchin-like NiCoS nanorod arrays supported on nickle foam (NF) by electrodeposition-hydrothermal reaction process. Notably, during the hydrothermal process, molybdate and P123 are used directly as indispensable structure-directing agents for the growth of urchin-like nanorods. Moreover, the obtained urchin-like NiCoS nanorod presents as a highly active oxygen evolution reaction anode with a current density of 100 mA cm(-2) at the overpotential of 360 mV. Combined with its excellent catalytic performance as hydrogen evolution reaction cathode with 50 mA cm-2 at an overpotential of 200 mV in 1 M KOH. XRD show that the mixed phases of CoS, Co9S8 and Ni3S2 coexisted in the NiCoS/NF. SEM images illustrate that the average diameter of urchin-like NiCoS nanorod is about 100 nm, demonstrating the successful fabrication of urchin-like NiCoS nanorod arrays. The enhanced electrocatalytic activity of NiCoS may drive from the synergistic effect of the mixed transition metal sulfides and the unique urchin-like nanostructure of NiCoS.

The question is whether widespread computational electrochemistry models based on adsorption thermodynamics are capable of reproducing such observations. Making use of DFT results of revised Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof (RPBE) and Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof (PBE) functionals from six different codes and various types of pseudopotentials, we show that whereas IrO2 is consistently predicted to have low overpotentials, RuO2 is predicted to have large overpotentials. A new methodology based on adsorption-energy scaling relations shows that the inaccurate prediction for RuO2 stems from its anomalous adsorption energies of oxygen/oxygenates. Including explicit water solvation and using functionals that account for van der Waals interactions such as vdW-DF, vdW-DF2 and optPBE-vdW modifies appropriately the adsorption energies so that both oxides are predicted to be highly active.									67	0	0	0	2	0	67			1867-3880	1867-3899		WOS:000398859500016

Atomic site electrocatalysts (ASCs), including single-atomic site catalysts (SASCs) and diatomic site catalysis (DASCs), are being pursued as economical alternatives to noble-metal-based catalysts for these reactions by virtue of their exceptionally high atom utilization efficiencies, well-defined active sites and high selectivities. In this review, we start from a systematic review on the fabrication routes of ASCs followed by an overview of some new and effective characterization methods to precisely probe the atomic structure. Then we give a comprehensive summary on the current advances in some typical clean energy reactions: water splitting, including hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER); oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), including selective 4e(-) - ORR toward H2O/OH- and 2e(-) - ORR toward H2O2/HO2-; selective electrooxidation of formic acid, methanol and ethanol (FAOR, MOR and EOR).

Fabricating adequate electrocatalysts for water splitting is fervently preferred to curtail their overpotentials and hasten practical utilizations. In this work, a series of Ce-MOF, GO@Ce-MOF, calcinated Ce-MOF, and calcinated GO@Ce-MOF were synthesized and used as high-proficient electrocatalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction. The physicochemical characteristics of the prepared samples were measured by diverse analytical techniques including SEM, HRTEM, FTIR, BET, XPS, XRD, and EDX. All materials underwent cyclic voltammetry tests and were evaluated by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and oxygen evolution reaction. Ce-MOF, GO@Ce-MOF, calcinated Ce-MOF, and calcinated GO@Ce-MOF have remarkable properties such as enhanced specific surface area, improved catalytic performance, and outstanding permanency in the alkaline solution (KOH). These factors upsurge ECSA and intensify the OER performance of the prepared materials. More exposed surface active-sites present in calcinated GO@Ce-MOF could be the logic for superior electrocatalytic activity. Chronoamperometry of the catalyst for 15 & DEG;h divulges long-term stability of Ce-MOF during OER. Impedance measurements indicate higher conductivity of synthesized catalysts, facilitating the charge transfer reaction during electrochemical water splitting. This study will open up a new itinerary for conspiring highly ordered MOF-based surface active resources for distinct electrochemical energy applications.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2296-2646			WOS:000875631200001	36277339

Main results indicate that the OER is strongly influenced by the nature and amount of the doping agent in addition to the interaction with the electrolyte media, which also conditioned the Area(D)/Area(G) (A(D)/A(G)) ratio and the position of the D- and G-bands. Additionally, an exhaustive Raman characterization of powder materials and catalyst inks in the presence of air, water and sodium hydroxide is reported. Finally, the percentage of molecular oxygen production is estimated by a novel procedure. This work is not intended to reveal the best catalysts toward the OER, but to show novel techniques to study the OER at graphene-based catalysts. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

First International Telecommunication Energy Special Conference								463	70						1994	1994	The main reactions involved in the charge process of positive and negative lead-acid battery plates are associated with electrochemical decomposition of water. To avoid falling electrolyte level, the battery must be regularly topped up with water, i.e. it requires maintenance. In principle, two methods have been developed to reduce water loss during battery operation. The first involves increasing the overvoltage of hydrogen and oxygen evolution by the use of special alloys, and limiting the charge voltage to below the voltage of water decomposition. The second approach to maintenance-free operation is to encourage the recombination of the hydrogen and oxygen released in the cell. This can be achieved through: (a) an oxygen cycle, whereby the oxygen released on the positive plate is reduced on the negative one; (b) recombination of the released gases to water on the catalytic plug; and (c) oxygen reduction and hydrogen oxidation on the partially-immersed catalytic electrodes. It was established in the 1970s that tungsten carbide (WC) had good catalytic activity towards the H2 reaction in H2SO4 electrolyte. The aims of the present study are to investigate the catalytic activity of WC towards hydrogen and oxygen released during lead-acid battery operation, and to develop a lead-acid battery with partially immersed WC electrodes.

Here, a facile strategy to fabricate Ir-based gas diffusion electrodes (GDEs) is proposed using electrochemical methods and subsequent oxidation processes. In brief, the spontaneous displacement of Ir on Ni supported by a carbon paper facilitates the simple fabrication of a metallic Ir GDE with an Ir loading mass of 53.9 mu gIr/cm2. Further, electrochemical and thermochemical oxidation processes enable modulation of the Ir oxidation state. Based on half-cell measurements, it is revealed that the Ir3+ and Ir4+ ratios play an important role in the activity and stability, respectively, of the oxygen evolution reaction. Compared with the state-of-the-art Ir-based anodes, the Ir-based GDE employed as an anode for PEMWE singlecell operation demonstrates a superior mass activity of 6.8 A/mgIr at a cell voltage of 1.6 Vcell, originating from the structural advantage of GDEs for achieving high Ir utilization. Moreover, the PEMWE shows acceptable stability during long-term (12 h) operations at a current density of 1.00 A/cm2.									6	1	0	0	1	0	7			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000664255400003

Compared with SACs, DACs have higher metal loading and more complex and flexible active sites, thus achieving better catalytic performance and providing more opportunities for electrocatalysis. This review introduces the research progress in recent years on how to design new DACs to enhance the performance of electrocatalysis. Firstly, the advantages of DACs in increasing metal loading are introduced. Then, the role of DACs in changing the adsorption condition of reactant molecules on metal atoms is discussed. Moreover, the ways in which DACs can reduce the reaction energy barrier of key steps and change the reaction path are explored. Catalytic applications in different electrocatalytic reactions, including the carbon dioxide reduction reaction, oxygen reduction reaction, oxygen evolution reaction, hydrogen evolution reaction, and nitrogen reduction reaction are followed. Finally, a brief summary is made and the key challenges and prospects of DACs are introduced.									24	0	0	0	0	0	24			1614-6832	1614-6840		WOS:000743875100001

Notably, the electric current density of the oxygen evolution reaction rapidly increases from 9.4 to 31.0 mA cm( )(-2)at 1.8 V and the Tafel slope reduces from 150 to 87 mV dec(-1), originating from electrochemically delaminating the thick 2D MOF precursors into ultrathin (similar to 4 nm) nanosheets to expose more catalytic active sites. Furthermore, the electrocatalytic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity of these 2D heterometallic MOF nanosheets can be effectively manipulated through precisely altering the lanthanide component of the Ni(4)Ln SBU in the layered MOFs. Density functional theory calculations reveal that the lanthanide ion of the SBU affects the adsorption and desorption capacity of active nickel centers to OER-relevant species, leading to the difference of the catalytic activity.									15	2	0	0	1	0	15			2168-0485			WOS:000553241400026

However, this reaction is kinetically unfavorable and requires a large overpotential when conducted in the absence of a precious metal catalyst. Substituting these precious metal catalysts with more abundant transition metal oxide such as Fe2O3 is a key challenge for widespread applications of water splitting. The catalytic activity of the Fe2O3 for water oxidation is mostly limited by the poor electric conductivity and low electrolyte permeability on catalyst surface. To overcome these limitations in this work, we have synthesized a composite between Fe2O3 nanorods and oxidized multi-walled carbon nanotubes via a simple urea assisted co-precipitation method. The Fe2O3 nanorods with hollow interior and low crystallinity provided improved electrochemically active surface area and larger number of transportation channels for diffusion of electrolyte. While, introduction of the carbon nanotube caused significant drop in resistance associated with faradic process. Consequently, the Fe2O3/carbon nanotube composite displayed excellent catalytic activity which is superior to Fe2O3, carbon nanotubes and their physical mixture. It is noted that the present work provides a simple strategy for the development of high performance oxygen evolution catalyst based on Fe2O3. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

In this work, we fabricate the Ni-Fe alloy dendritic array matrix by the facile electrodeposition process for the first time. It can provide a large number of vertical paths for electrolyte ions, electron transfer and gas overflow, which further helps to improve the electrochemical performance of electrode. Whereafter, the metal on the surface of dendrite is converted into NiFe2O4 via in situ calcination oxidation method. The NiFe2O4@NiFe dendrite matrix electrode is characterized by Field emission scanning electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analysis. During the oxygen evolution reaction measurement, the as-prepared NiFe2O4@NFM-3 requires a low overpotential of 234 mV (vs.RHE) to arrive 10 mA cm(-2) current density. Furthermore, the NiFe2O4@NFM-3 electrode reveals the high area capacitance about 1560 mF cm(-2) at current density of 1 mA cm(-2). The electrochemical performances test results demonstrate that this fiber electrode can serve as the bifunctional electrode in oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and energy storage.

Choosing a suitable carbon source and spinning process to prepare carbon fiber can maximize the electrocatalytic performance and resource recycling rate. Here, we use the waste lignin from the pulping industry to prepare lignin-based functional materials, electrospinning after blending with PEO. The obtained nanocomposite fiber exhibits the characteristics of anisotropic network structure and metal anchored by carbon fiber, improves conductivity, and provides a convenient channel for electron transmission. Furthermore, both the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in this study show that the prepared LFC-Ni/Co has good catalytic activity.

Oxide coated amorphous alloys were produced by applying a cyclic potential routine to the amorphous alloys immersed in alkaline solution at 30 degrees C. Oxide coatings were characterized by electrochemical techniques and ir spectroscopy. The electrocatalytic activity of oxide coated amorphous alloy electrodes was tested for the oxygen evolution reaction in alkaline solution at 30 degrees C. The high electrocatalytic activity of these electrodes is explained through the development of a porous hydrous oxide film with a spinel-type structure.

Among the active metals, iridium oxide provides the best compromise in terms of activity and stability. The limited availability and usage in other applications demands an efficient utilization of this precious metal. Forming mixed oxides with titania promises improved Ir utilization, but often at the cost of a low catalyst surface area. Moreover, the role of Ir in establishing a sufficiently conductive mixed oxide has not been elucidated so far. We report a new approach for the synthesis of Ir/TiOx mixed-oxide catalysts with defined template-controlled mesoporous structure, low crystallinity, and superior oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity. The highly accessible pore system provides excellent Ir dispersion and avoids transport limitations. A controlled variation of the oxides Ir content reveals the importance of the catalysts electrical conductivity: at least 0.1 Sm-1 are required to avoid limitations owing to slow electron transport. For sufficiently conductive oxides a clear linear correlation between Ir surface sites and OER currents can be established, where all accessible Ir sites equally contribute to the reaction. The optimized catalysts outperform Ir/TiOx materials reported in literature by about a factor of at least four.									21	0	0	0	0	0	21			1864-5631	1864-564X		WOS:000439757800012	29813183

Side reactions take place during the oxidation of Zry-2 and Zry-4 in phosphate electrolytes. With Zry-2, oxygen evolution occurs at high anodic potentials. The oxidation of the alloys in nitric acid shows dissolution of their minor alloying elements but no oxygen evolution at high potentials.

We discovered that iron phosphide is far superior to its counterparts with an onset potential lower by 150 mV. Furthermore, we found that the anodic voltammetric scan with associated oxidation of Fe(II) in the phosphide generates OER active sites; however, ambient oxidation of iron phosphide prior to that anodic scan deactivates the catalyst.									6	1	0	0	0	0	6			2574-0962			WOS:000458706400010

The cobalt intercalation was verified by employing state-of-the-art characterization techniques such as X-ray diffraction, Raman spectroscopy, and electron microscopy. It is demonstrated that the Co2+/birnessite electrocatalyst can reach 10 mA cm(-2) at an overpotential of 360 mV with near-unity Faradaic efficiency. This overpotential is lower than that which can be achieved by using a pure cobalt hydroxide electrocatalyst for the OER.

Herein, partially amorphous NiFe hydroxide nanoparticles were synthesized via a facile solvothermal method for application as a highly efficient and stable electrocatalyst to produce oxygen by water decomposition. The partially amorphous phase and tunable component ratio of the NiFe-based hydroxide nanoparticles contributed to their excellent electrocatalytic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity. Overpotentials of 265 and 296 mV were required to deliver current densities of 10 and 50 mA cm(-2), respectively, and the Tafel slope was as low as 58.6 mV dec(-1) in 1.0 M KOH. Besides, the OER performance of the nanoparticles was stable for more than 35 h. Ex situ Raman spectroscopic and electrochemical analyses revealed that the defect sites were the electrochemically formed in the metal hydroxide. The proposed approach provides a reliable method for enhancing the performance of other NiFe-based catalysts for water oxidation.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0947-8396	1432-0630		WOS:000710215400001

However, their poor catalytic activity and time-consuming synthesis remain a challenge. Herein, we report a facile and green technique using pulsed laser ablation for preparing Ni-doped multi-walled carbon nanotubes (Ni-MWCNTs) as OER catalysts. Ni-MWCNTs exhibit high surface area, oxygen-rich functional groups (e.g., hydroxyl and carboxyl), and successful doping of Ni in the carbon framework. The as-prepared Ni-MWCNTs exhibited excellent OER catalytic performance, with an overpotential of 320 mV at the current density of 10 mA cm(-2) in an alkaline medium, which is lower than that of the commercial RuO2 catalyst. Furthermore, Ni-MWCNTs displayed the initial electrocatalytic activity after 10-h stability tests, demonstrating good electrochemical durability. We believe that this work provides a simple protocol for fabricating heteroatom-doped carbon nanotubes as high-performance OER electrocatalysts.									4	1	0	0	1	0	5			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000631644700003

Water splitting catalysts are largely developed with noble-based transition metals to lower the energy requirement for the overall water splitting reactions. However, the high cost of precious metal-based catalyst necessitated ongoing search for cheap and efficient oxygen and hydrogen evolution reaction catalysts. NiCuCoS3 were prepared by solventless solid state method and was well characterized by several techniques including field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), X-ray diffraction spectroscopy (XRD), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), Fourier Transform infrared red spectroscopy (FTIR), energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (XEDS). The as-prepared NiCuCoS3 was applied for water splitting activities with satisfactory performance. The onset for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in 1 M KOH was noticed at the electrode potential E = 1.78 V-/RHE (vs. the reversible hydrogen electrode corresponding to an overpotential eta = 0.55 V, with a current density of 10 mA cm(2) obtained at E = 1.92 V-/RHE (eta = 0.69 V). Similarly, the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) occurred at an onset of E = 0.58 V-/RHE, with a current density of 10 mA/cm(2) obtained at E = 0.60 V-/RHE (with h equal to E vs. RHE for the HER). Likewise, OER and HER had Tafel slopes (130 mV/dec and 116 mV/dec respectively). The developed catalyst also showed high stability as established by linear sweep voltammetry, chronoamperometry and chronopotentiometry. This approach is seen as the right track of making water electrolysis for hydrogen energy feasible through provision of low-energy requirement for electrolytic process. (C) 2021 The Author(s).

The resulting material, possessing a high surface area of 251 m(2) g(-1) and a large carbon content of 52.1 wt %, can be directly used as the working electrode for oxygen evolution reaction without employing extra substrates or binders. This novel oxygen evolution electrode can smoothly operate in alkaline solutions (e.g., 0.1 and 1.0 M KOH), affording a low onset potential of 1.47 V (vs reversible hydrogen electrode) and a stable current density of 10.0 mA cm(-2) at 1.52 V in 0.1 M KOH solution for at least 30 h, associated with a high Faradaic efficiency of 99.3%. The achieved ultrahigh oxygen evolution activity and strong durability, with superior performance in comparison to the state-of-the-art noble-metal/transition-metal and nonmetal catalysts, originate from the unique nanowire array electrode configuration and in situ carbon incorporation, which lead to the large active surface area, enhanced mass/charge transport capability, easy release of oxygen gas bubbles, and strong structural stability. Furthermore, the hybrid Co3O4-carbon porous nanowire arrays can also efficiently catalyze oxygen reduction reaction, featuring a desirable four electron pathway for reversible oxygen evolution and reduction, which is potentially useful for rechargeable metal-air batteries, regenerative fuel cells, and other important clean energy devices.									1494	77	0	0	64	0	1511			0002-7863			WOS:000342608800072	25216300

A single cell is assembled by IrO2/TNO Hx as anode catalyst, commercial Pt/C as cathode catalytic and Nafion 117 membrane as electrolyte. At a low loading mass of IrO2, the IrO2/TNO H750 sample shows the optimum oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity (1.832 V at 1 A . cm(2)), which is superior to that of unsupported IrO2 (1.858 eV at 1 A . cm(2)), and remains stable for 100 h operating at a current density of 1 Acm 2. This work provides a rational design strategy for developing low cost and efficient anode catalysts support.									8	0	0	0	0	0	8			1867-3880	1867-3899		WOS:000472232800017

Herein, Ni-nanofiber-based three-dimensional (3D) network is prepared by a magnetic-field-assisted reduction reaction and then a fast surface modification within only 3 s at room temperature is developed to prepare Fe@Ni-nanofiber-based 3D porous electrode. The unique structure of the nanofiber-based 3D electrode ensures large electrochemical active surface area, short electron diffusion pathway, and fast mass transportation, while the introduction of Fe enhances the activity of each active site with abundant Ni(Fe) (oxy)hydroxide on the surface. Hence, the obtained Fe@Ni nanofiber electrode exhibits excellent activity and stability toward oxygen evolution reaction and hydrogen evolution reaction, with overpotentials as low as 230 and 55 mV to achieve a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) in alkaline electrolyte, respectively. Moreover, when assembled into a two-electrode configuration, the cell voltage of only 1.53 V is needed to drive the water-splitting cell at 10 mA cm(-2).									20	2	0	0	1	0	21			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000469288300028	31046220

To establish efficient electrocatalytic water splitting, the overall overpotential for this reaction must be minimized via developing efficient catalysts to promote oxygen and hydrogen evolution at the anode and the cathode, respectively. However, the overpotentials (eta(10)(O2)) for oxygen evolution are insufficiently low (162-300 mV for a current density of 10 mA cm(-2)), and the eta(10)(O2) value less than 100 mV still remains untracked. Here, we report the unprecedentedly low eta(10)(O2) of 32 mV for oxygen evolution attained by the formation of a unique motif of nickel sulfide nanowires stuffed into carbon nitride scabbards (NiSx/C3N4), demonstrating electrocatalytic water splitting at the lowest overall overpotential of 72 mV using the NiSx/C3N4 anode. This motif provides a key to guided thought for the development of efficient catalysts for oxygen evolution.									29	0	0	0	1	0	29			1754-5692	1754-5706		WOS:000656887200001

In this study, iron induction into cobalt oxide (Co₃O₄) has resulted composite structure by wet chemical method. The iron impurity has brought an electronic disorder into Fe₃O₄/cobalt oxide composite thereby efficient oxygen evolution reaction is demonstrated. An addition of iron content into composite resulted the alternation of morphology from Nano rods to clusters of nanoparticles. The successive addition of iron into composite system reduced the onset potential of OER as compared to the pristine cobalt oxide. A Tafel slope of 80 mVdec-1 indicates the favorable oxygen evolution reaction kinetics on the sample 4. An over-potential of 370 mV is required to reach a 10 mAcm-2 current density which is acceptable for a nonprecious catalyst. The catalyst is highly durable and stable for 30 hours. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy further provided a deeper insight on charge transfer resistance and sample 4 has low charge transfer resistance that supported the OER polarization curves. The sample 4 has more electrochemical active surface area of 393.5 cm. These obtained results are exciting and highlighting the importance of composite structure and leave a huge space for the future investigations on composite materials for energy related applications.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2				1533-4899		MEDLINE:33500092	33500092

Here, a series of boron-doped graphene (BG)-supported bimetallic oxides of Co and Ni were obtained and served as OER electrocatalysts. Surprisingly, the annealed Co-Ni-O-x/BG with a Co/Ni ratio of 1:1 exhibits high performance toward oxygen evolution in alkaline electrolyte. The overpotential is only 310 mV at the current density of 10 mA cm(-2), superior to many mono-metallic oxides reported before, and even comparable to the commercial RuO2. The regulation of charge distribution in bimetallic oxides and the strong synergistic coupling effects together contribute to the superior electrocatalytic performance of the Co-Ni-O-x/BG toward OER.

Herein, NiCoO2/CoO/Ni3N nanosheet arrays (NiCoON NSAs/NF) are fabricated in situ on the 3D nickel foam. In the alkaline solution, the NiCoON nanocomposite has excellent catalytic OER properties such as a small overpotential of 247 mV (at 10 mA cm(-2)) and Tafel slope of 35 mV dec(-1), which are better than those of NixCo3-xO4 and most Ni- and Co-based catalysts. There are more active sites with oxygen vacancies on NiCoON NSAs after the treatment with NH3 and the face-centered cubic NiCoO2 enhances the formation of active Ni-Co layered hydroxide/oxyhydroxide species (NiOOH) in comparison with spinal NixCo3-xO4 during the electrochemical process. In addtion, the Ni3+-rich surface together with Co incorporation facilitates the formation of beta-NiOOH. Our study reveals that control of active species on NiCoON NSAs/NF leads to high activity and stability in OER catalysis.									92	4	0	0	1	0	93			2211-2855	2211-3282		WOS:000444859700039

Bifunctional or even multifunctional catalysts have higher performance and lower cost than monofunctional catalysts, which is currently an emerging focus in the development of electrocatalysts. The single-atom catalysts (SACs) of two-dimensional (2D) materials-supported transition metal (TM) atoms have attracted great attention because of their ability to make full use of metal atoms and remarkable catalytic performance. In this work, the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) catalytic properties of B4N and B2O monolayers supported TM atoms have been systematically evaluated based on first-principles calculations. The adsorption free energy of key intermediates (OOH*, O* and OH*) on the catalyst determines the catalytic activity toward OER and ORR. The calculation results exhibit that Ni@B4N and Pd@B2O systems are potential bifunctional electrocatalysts with the overpotential (eta) of OER/ORR being just 0.45/0.43 V and 0.56/0.47 V, respectively, which are comparable to the known noble metal catalysts. Therefore, the study of catalytic activity of SACs on 2D substrate materials provides a broad prospect for the development of stable, low-cost, high-activity noble metal-free electrocatalysts, and provides help for solving energy and environmental problems.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0022-2461	1573-4803		WOS:000737779800029

Lattice-strain engineering constructs high-efficiency oxygen redox catalysts by tuning the physicochemical properties of nanomaterials. However, the randomness and complexity of lattice mismatch make it difficult to effectively identify the structure-activity relationship between the strain and catalyst. Herein, a strategy of Ru triggered partial coordination environment mutation of ZnIn2S4 (R(0.1)ZIS) to regulate the d-band center of catalytic sites is provided, which dramatically activates intrinsic activity and accelerates electron transfer. Density functional theory calculations and system characterizations reveal that local lattice strain causes anti-bonding orbital to occupy more electrons and narrower bandwidth, reduce the migration energy barrier of *OH deprotonation and optimize the adsorption/desorption process of oxygen-containing intermediates, thus demonstrating extraordinary catalytic performance in oxygen reduction reaction and oxygen evolution reaction. Expectedly, the R(0.1)ZIS-based cell delivers the open circuit potential of 1.587 V almost identical to the theoretical voltage, and an ultralow voltage gap of 0.71 V after undergoing 262 h operation. This work offers a promising avenue for building lattice-strain engineering to realize robust bifunctional electrocatalysts.									7	0	0	0	1	0	7			1616-301X	1616-3028		WOS:000749350600001

Herein, we prepared a bifunctional three-dimensional graphene-like iron-nitrogen doped oxygen electrocatalyst (3D Fe/N-G#4, polyacrylamide (PAM):-NaCl = 1:4, mass ratio) by a facile synthesis with PAM and iron as precursors and NaCl as template. The NaCl template melted during the pyrolysis process, which could fabricate a stable 3D network structure in the precursors to form more mesopores, higher specific surface area, and more exposed active sites and prevent the loss of precursors. The low-cost and water-soluble PAM as the N precursor provided abundant N and dissolved adequately with NaCl solution. The Fe precursor coordinated with the N to form Fe-N-x active sites that were investigated by HR-TEM, XRD, XPS, and RDE techniques. The 3D Fe/N-G#4 exhibited excellent electrochemical activity with a high half-wave potential (0.852 V vs RHE) for ORR and a low overpotential (393 mV at 10 mA cm(-2)) for OER in the alkaline conditions. In addition, the homemade rechargeable ZAB based on the prepared 3D Fe/N-G#4 exhibits high power density (168.2 mW cm(-2)) and excellent discharge-charge cycling stability (over 60 h) at 20 mA cm(-2). This work provides a cost-efficient, simple, and eco-friendly method to synthesize excellent bifunctional non noble electrocatalysts for commercialization of ZABs.									34	1	0	0	0	0	34			2168-0485			WOS:000482173100027

Based on density functional theory, the catalytic activity of TM3(HHTP)(2) (2,3,6,7,10,11-hexahydroxytriphenylene) monolayer and its variations (TMX4, where TM = Fe, Co, Ni, X = O, S, Se) for bifunctional ORR/OER have been investigated. The adsorption ability is dominated by the metal center, in the order of Fe > Co > Ni while the ligand shows the minor contribution. Due to the presence of linear relations between the intermediates, the activity of TMX4 for the ORR/OER follows a dual volcano curve as a function of the OH adsorption strength. Considering the overpotential, CoO4 and CoS4 possess superior bifunctional activity, implying their promise as candidates for the oxygen electrode reaction. This systematical work may open new avenues for the development of high-performance non-PGM catalysts for practical applications of ORR and OER.									19	1	0	0	0	0	19			2046-2069			WOS:000416827600005

Herein, the unique lasagna-like structured copper-cobalt sulfides wrapped with N-doped reduced graphene oxide (CuCoS/N-rGO) were first fabricated through in situ controllable growth of bimetallic metal-organic frameworks (CuCo-BTC) on GO followed by further pyrolysis and sulfuration. The interconnected structure was formed because the bimetallic ions and carboxyl groups in the CuCo-BTC precursor combine with the functional groups (-COOH, -OH, etc.) on the surface of GO to interconnect the graphene sheets to avoid agglomeration of subsequent pyrolysis. In turn, the carbonized graphene was used as a space-constrained reactor to wrap CuCoS particles to prevent their aggregation and the electronic distribution changed between them to produce an excellent synergistic effect. In the exploration of the molar ratios of bimetallic ions, the optimal CuCoS-4/N-rGO with n(Co)/n(Cu) of 4:1 possessed a unique structure, a larger specific surface area (150 m(2) g(-1)), and splendid electrocatalytic activity, with the highest onset potential of 0.97 V (vs reversible hydrogen electrode, RHE), the largest limiting current density of 5.2 mA cm(-), outstanding durability toward the oxygen reduction reaction, and the smallest overpotential of 288 mV (vs RHE) at 10 mA cm(-2) toward the oxygen evolution reaction.

Two categories of beta-MoO2 NSs are grown on a silicon substrate via a hydrogenation process from pregrown alpha-MoO2 structures. The postgrown MoO2 system gets OH- occupancy after 7 h of annealing (MoO2+OH-). On increasing the annealing duration to 9 hrs, both oxygen vacancies and OH - occupancy have been made into the MoO2 system (MoO2-x+OH-). The as grown materials have been assessed for promising energy conversion applications toward electrocatalytic OER. The as-grown MoO2-x+OH-. very efficiently catalyzes the OER at a lower overpotential and yields a higher current density compared to the as-grown MoO2+OH- and commercial MoO2. Both the oxygen vacancy and OH- occupancy in the MoO2 system play a synergistic role in enhancing the OER properties. The experimental observations are validated theoretically and plausibly explained with the help of a state-of-the-art density study. The simulation calculations reveal that the introduction of oxygen vacancy and OH- occupancy lowers the overpotential of OER The OH- ions act passively on the surfaces of MoO2 that decrease the binding of reaction intermediates and aid in easy desorption of O-2 molecules. Besides, the oxygen defect sites reduce the charge-transfer resistance, which eventually reduces the OER overpotential. Our empirical findings with theoretical supports render a significant shrewdness to the electrocatalytic performances of the defect-engineering MoO 2 systems toward OER applications.									29	1	0	0	2	0	29			2574-0962			WOS:000543715100016

We demonstrate the effect of Co nanoparticles and/or the porous carbon matrix in pristine CoFe2O4(CFO) electrocatalysts towards the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The Co/CoFe2O4-carbon network (CCFOC) with a high surface area and good conductivity offered more active sites for oxygen adsorption as well as accelerated electron transfer kinetics, leading to superior ORR and OER activities. A Li-air battery split cell was fabricated using the CCFOC as an air-breathing electrode, which exhibited a high discharge capacity of 4320 mAh g(-1)at a high current density of 100 mA g(-1)with an acceptable cycling stability and columbic efficiency.

This work presents bimetal cobaltite hollow nanofiber electrocatalysts as the photocathodes in the ZABs. Among all catalysts, the NiCo2O4 hollow nanofiber exhibits superior performances towards OER and ORR. Under light irradiation (AM1.5), the NiCo2O4 can absorb photon energy and generate free electrons and photogenerated carriers or holes, reducing the energy barrier enhancing the kinetic activity of OER/ORR. The NiCo2O4 hollow nanofiber decreases the OER and ORR overpotentials for 14.3% and 8.1%, respectively and improves the OER and ORR kinetics for 19.3% and 20.8%, respectively compared with those under dark condition. The in situ electrochemical X-ray absorption spectroscopy results reveal that light can enhance both Ni and Co catalytic activities but Ni is found to be the main active species for the OER. The as-fabricated ZAB cell with the NiCo2O4 photocathode exhibits the decreasing voltage gap from 0.85 V (Dark) to 0.64 V (Light) due to the highly active hole and the excited electron increasing the specific capacity up to 11.4% as compared to that under dark condition.

However, the development of flexible zinc-air batteries is stagnant due to the lack of efficient bifunctional catalysts with high oxygen catalytic activity and flexible solid-state electrolytes with high mechanical stability and ionic conductivity. In this work, Co3O4/Ag@NrGO composite was synthesized by a facile one-pot method, and the catalyst shows remarkable oxygen reduction reaction (ORR)/oxygen evolution reaction (OER) bifunctional catalytic activity and good long-term stability. In particular, the OER overpotential of Co3O4/Ag@NrGO reaches 437mV, outperforming that of the commercial IrO2 catalyst. This can be attributed to the combined effects of Co3O4, Ag, and N-rGO. Furthermore, PAA (polyacrylic acid) and PVA (polyvinyl alcohol) based gel-electrolytes have been developed as flexible solid-state electrolytes for zinc-air batteries. The results show that PAA-based electrolyte is more favorable to the flexible zinc-air battery with a high power density due to its relatively high ionic conductivity. The maximum power density of flexible zinc-air batteries with Co3O4/Ag@NrGO catalyst and PAA-based electrolyte can reach 108mWcm(-2), which is almost the highest value reached in recent reports. This work will provide valuable guidance for the development of flexible rechargeable zinc-air batteries with high power density and stability.									34	1	0	0	1	0	35			0947-6539	1521-3765		WOS:000446067800032	30063103

Herein, substituent position effect of Co porphyrins on oxygen electrocatalysis, including the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), was investigated. Two Co porphyrins, namely 2,4,6-OMe-CoP and 3,4,5-OMe-CoP, were selected as the research objects. The ORR and OER performance was evaluated by drop-coating molecular catalysts on carbon nanotubes (CNTs). The resulted 3,4,5-OMe-CoP/CNT exhibited high bifunctional electrocatalytic activities and better long-term stability for both ORR and OER than 2,4,6-OMe-CoP/CNT. Furthermore, when applied in the Zn-air battery, 3,4,5-OMe-CoP/CNT exhibited comparable performance to that with precious metal-based materials. The enhanced catalytic activity may be attributed to the improved charge transfer rate, mass transfer and hydrophilicity. This work provides an effective strategy to further enhance catalytic activity by introducing substituent position effect, which is of great importance for developing more efficient energy-related electrocatalysts.

In this review, we present and discuss a universal origin of inductive effect associated with metal substitution in Ni, Co, Fe, Mn-based complexes, (hydr-) oxides, and lithium intercalation compounds by alignment of the electron levels of metal complex redox with partially filled metal d-state and oxygen p-state of oxides on the absolute energy scale. Increased redox potentials of metal complexes and oxides are shown to correlate with the increased electronegativity of the substituting metal, which results in the enhancement of the ORR/OER activity. Such observations provide new insights into potential strategies to optimize ORR/OER catalytic activity by tuning the redox properties of metal sites.									161	7	0	0	11	0	164			2542-4351			WOS:000435090900008

It is highly desirable to develop inexpensive and efficient electrocatalyst for both the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER). In this paper, nanostructured Ni-Co-Sn alloys were electrodeposited on copper foil and the excellent electrocatalytic performances for both HER and OER in alkaline media were achieved. The optimized Ni-Co-Sn electrode shows a low onset overpotential of -18 mV and a small Tafel slope of 63 mV/dec for the HER, comparable to many state-of-the-art non-precious metal HER catalysts. For the OER, it produces an overpotential of 270 mV (1.50 V us. RHE) at current density of 10 mA/cm(2), which is better than that of the commercial Ir/C catalyst. In addition to high electrocatalytic activities, it exhibits good stability for both HER and OER. This is the first report that Ni-Co-Sn is served as a cost-effective and highly efficient bifunctional catalyst for water splitting and it will be of great practical value.

In this prospect, we report on the effective trifunctional electrocatalytic properties of nitrogen (N) doped graphitic carbon nanofibers (CNFs). The CNFs were synthesized on a nichrome (NiCr) foil by chemical vapor deposition (CVD) process. Incorporation of Ni and Cr was observed in the N doped CNFs sample from microscopic and spectroscopic analysis. The metal nanoparticles can be significant in boosting the trifunctional electrocatalytic behavior. The effective oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) activities were obtained for the CNFs sample with relatively good overpotential values. The electron transfer number per O-2 molecule calculated from Koutecky-Levich (K-L) plot was found to be 2e(-) for the ORR reaction. The OER activity of the CNFs is comparable to commercially available iridium oxide (IrO2), signifying the effectiveness of the developed catalyst. Our study revealed that N doped CNFs with incorporation of metal particles synthesized on a binary metal substrate can be significant as ORR, OER, HER trifunctional electrocatalyst.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			2365-6549			WOS:000656866500001

However, tuning MXenes towards superb hydrogen/oxygen evolution reaction (HER/OER) activity has remained elusive. Using first-principles calculations along with machine learning (ML) based descriptors, it is shown that late transition metal doping is able to significantly promote HER/OER activities. Both single-atom adsorption onto a stable hollow site above the outer oxygen layer single-atom catalyst 1 (SAC1), and single-atom replacement at a sub-surface metal layer (SAC2) are considered. An adsorbate evolving mechanism (AEM) is preferred for SAC1, while the increased M-O bond covalency for SAC2 makes lattice oxygen mechanism (LOM) favored. It is found that a single Ni or Co atom embedded into MXenes provides a suitable number of electrons for optimal AEM and raises the O 2p band towards activated LOM. The stability and superb bifunctional catalytic capability of MXene combinations (Ni-doped Sc3N2O2 and Ni-doped Nb3C2O2) towards both HER and OER are demonstrated. The electronic and geometric descriptors used in the ML analysis work universally for classification of high-performing HER/OER catalysts. This work provides a rational strategy for promoting bifunctional electrocatalytic activities based on low-cost MXenes metals.									23	1	0	0	0	0	23			1614-6832	1614-6840		WOS:000715156800001

Herein, we present the directed-evolution-enabled bifunctional turnover of ChaP, which is a homotetramer and represents an unprecedented VOC enzyme class. Unlike the ChaP catalysis of extradiol-like o-quinone cleavage and concomitant alpha-keto acid decarboxylation, a group of ChaP variants (CVs) catalyze intradiol-like o-quinone deconstruction and CO2 liberation from the resulting o-hydroxybenzoic acid scaffolds with high regioselectivity.

The as-obtained Ni/Co-S electrodes show exceptional HER performance with excellent durability in both acidic and alkaline solutions, acquiring a hydrogen evolving current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at overpotentials of merely 85 mV and 102 mV in 0.5 M H2SO4 and 1.0 M KOH, respectively. For the OER, the as-designed electrocatalyst can afford an oxygen evolving current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at an overpotential as low as 170 mV in 1.0 M KOH solution. Furthermore, an alkaline water splitting electrolyzer constructed with two pieces of Ni/Co-S electrodes can deliver a full water splitting current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at a voltage of 1.47 V. Moreover, a Faradic efficiency close to 100% is obtained. The as-revealed simple design, easiness to large-scale preparation and superior electrocatalytic performance enable the bifunctional Ni/Co-S act as promising electrode materials for overall water splitting.

Significant efforts have been made to decrease the amount of iridium in OER catalysts without sacrificing their catalytic performances. In this frontier paper, we present the main common issues relevant to the iridium-catalyzed OER, including catalytically active species, catalytic mechanisms and activity-stability relation. We also take iridium-based perovskites as an example, and summarize the recent theoretical and experimental advances in available strategies that can lead to highly efficient, low-iridium oxygen evolution electrocatalysts under acidic conditions. Finally, we propose the remaining challenges and future directions for exploring acidic OER catalysts.									2	1	0	0	0	0	3			1477-9226	1477-9234		WOS:000590136500003	33112324

The significant progress achieved by the interfacial engineering is mainly derived from its great ability on tuning the intermediate adsorption, controlling the electron and mass transportation, preventing catalysts from serious aggregation, as well as providing advanced promoter for the rational design of highly efficient catalysts. Here, the recent works on the interfacial engineered strategy for developing highly efficient bimetal based electrocatalysts are outlined. The advantages of interfacial engineered strategy on manipulating the activity, selectivity, and stability of catalysts are first discussed. The recent synthetic approaches for controlling the interface structures and the related hydrogen evolution reaction, oxygen evolution reaction, oxygen reduction reaction, and electroreduction of carbon dioxide are elaborated based on three major categories, involving metal/metal, metal/metal compound, and metal/support interfaces.

Density functional theory calculations reveal that the ferrocene units within the MOF crystalline structure enhance the overall electron transfer capacity, thereby leading to a theoretical overpotential of 0.52 eV, which is lower than that (0.81 eV) of the state-of-the-art NiFe double hydroxides.									37	0	0	0	2	0	37			1433-7851	1521-3773		WOS:000645286000001	33768623

The combination of the two techniques allows identifying both the surface and bulk modifications on the oxides and relating them to the activity loss during extended cycling. The results show that Co-Fe spinels experience a surface irreversible phase evolution under oxygen evolution reaction (OER) conditions, resulting in the formation of an amorphous layer composed of new stable Co(iii) and Fe(iii) species. Accelerated ageing tests show that the durability, intended as the performance loss during cycling treatments, is not directly related to the structural/chemical stability of the spinels but to the new species formed at the surface due to the electrochemical work. Thus, the material that experienced more significant changes was also the most durable one, demonstrating that the understanding of the chemical and/or structural evolution of the materials during the catalytic process can be the key for the design of highly active and stable catalysts.									33	2	0	0	3	0	33			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000431003600035

Herein, a CeO2/ Co4N heterostructure is rationally synthesized through the direct calcination of Ce[Co(CN)6], followed by thermal nitridation. The in situ electrochemically generated CoOOH on the surface of Co4N serves as the active site for the OER, and the coupled CeO2 with oxygen vacancy can optimize the energy barrier of intermediate reactions of the OER, which simultaneously boosts the OER performance. Besides, electrochemical measurement results demonstrate that oxygen vacancies in CeO2 and optimized absorption free energy originating from the electron transfer between CeO2 and CoOOH contribute to enhanced OER kinetics.

Herein, a hierarchical NiCo-LDH/NiCo2S4/CC electrode is prepared on carbon cloth by coupling NiCo-LDH nanosheets with NiCo2S4 nanoneedles through a simple process. This NiCo-LDH/NiCo2S4/CC electrode serves as an efficient bifunctional electrocatalyst for overall water splitting with excellent activity and stability in alkaline media. The enhanced electrocatalytic performance is ascribed to the hierarchical structure, the synergistic effect of NiCo-LDH and NiCo2S4 as well as the phase transformation of NiCo2S4 in alkaline condition. The NiCo-LDH/NiCo2S4/CC electrode requires overpotentials of 254 and 219 mV to deliver the current density of 50 mA cm(-2) for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in 1 M KOH aqueous solution, respectively. The Tafel results further reveal favorable reaction kinetics during electrolysis. When used as the bifunctional electrode for overall water splitting, the NiCo-LDH/NiCo2S4/CC performs superior activity with a voltage of 1.64 V at the current density of 50 mA cm(-2).

But the key issue limiting the large-scale application is that it demands a much higher overpotential than the theoretical oxygen evolution potential. Herein, we report an efficient electrochemical catalyst of NiFeBO synthesized via a facile one-step process, presenting remarkable catalytic activity and long-term stability. In this work, we discussed the effects of the doping of Fe and the insertion of BO2- in the as-synthesized NiFeBO. According to the experimental results, NiFeBO shows a very low overpotential of 256 mV and a Tafel slope of 53 mV dec(-1) with remarkable stability over 60 h of chronopotentiometry test. The inserted anion of BO2- can adsorb OH- in electrolyte around the catalyst to increase the concentration of OH- around the active sites, thereby improving the effectivity of oxygen evolution reaction. In addition, diffused microcrystalline with different lattice formed during the oxidation of the as-synthesized catalyst, providing more active sites than the pristine amorphous.

Under both conditions, a comma shaped polarization curve, corresponding to depletion of oxygen, was followed by an increase in current as the cell voltage was lowered. This characteristic was measured under potentiostatic mode, where no current is forced through the cell, and at a positive cell voltage (<100 mV in steady-state and similar to 300 mV in dynamic condition). With a theoretical model, we show that at these positive cell voltages and upon the depletion of oxygen, a shift in the Nernst potential occurs allowing for the hydrogen evolution reaction to take place in the cathode catalyst layer. The results of the model are complemented with experimental measurements of produced hydrogen at the cathode outlet. Copyright (C) 2013, Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

In this paper, nanoarchitecture consisted of Fe-based metal-organic frameworks (MIL-53) and metal-phenolic networks were created. Metal (Mn2+, Co2+, and Ni2+) phenolic networks were assembled on the surface of MIL-53 to form heterostructures. Among them, MIL-53(Fe)/Ni-phenolic network nanoarchitectures revealed the best electrochemical performance. The existence of MIL-53 enhanced the adsorption ability for OH center dot in the nanoarchitectures. The electron transfer between MIL-53 and Ni-phenolic networks adjusted the filling degree of eg orbitals to optimize the bonding strength between Fe3+/Ni2+ and oxygen intermediate species. MIL-53/Ni-phenolic networks nanoarchitectures exhibited well OER performance with a potential of 282 mV at 10 mA cm(-2). This work provided an efficient insight into the structure-properties relation of a promising heterostructure catalyst for water splitting.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000875305300001

Currently, the major challenge lies in establishing new design concepts to enhance the sluggish alkaline HER kinetics. Herein, we reported the synthesis of oxygen vacancy-rich CeO2 nanoparticles supported on Co4N nanorod arrays (CeO2/Co4N), and its remarkable HER performances and long-term stability. Density functional theory (DFT) and experiment results indicate that the promoted water adsorption/dissociation ability derived from the abundance of oxygen vacancies in CeO2, together with the optimized hydrogen adsorption free energy (Delta G(*H)) derived from electron transfer between CeO2 and Co4N, contribute to the outstanding HER activity with an overpotential of 30 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) under 1.0 M KOH. We believe the present work could provide new insight for rational design of other efficient non-noble metal based HER electrocatalysts and beyond.									83	3	0	0	5	0	83			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000552015900087

We have synthesized Ni2P nanoparticles anchored on Mg2O(OH)(2)-like phase supported on carbon paper. During the oxygen evolution reaction, the well-defined Ni2P nanoparticles serve as precursors for the immediate formation of active and stable nanostructured nickel hydroxide catalyst. As the anode for the oxygen evolution reaction in an alkaline electrolyte, the electrode shows a modest Tafel slope of 48 mV dec(-1) and a large turnover frequency of 0.05 s(-1) at an overpotential of 0.4 V. Microstructure and composition studies of the catalyst suggest that interfacial strain between Mg- and Ni-containing phases is responsible for high catalytic activity. A significant increase in catalytic activity upon the combination of magnesium compound and transition-metal phosphide suggests an interesting strategy for the controlled and reproducible preparation of active Earth-abundant oxygen-evolving catalysts.									64	3	0	0	0	0	65			2155-5435			WOS:000407309100061

In this study, this issue was investigated by synchrotron radiation powder X-ray diffraction. The evolution of Li2O2 morphology and structure was observed under actual electrochemical conditions of battery operation. By quantitatively tracking Li2O2 during discharge and charge, a two-step process was suggested for both growth and oxidation of Li2O2 owing to different mechanisms during two stages of both oxygen reduction reaction and oxygen evolution reaction. From an observation of the anisotropic broadening of Li2O2 in XRD patterns, it was inferred that disc-like Li2O2 grains are formed rapidly in the first step of discharge. These grains can stack together so that they facilitate the nucleation and growth of toroidal Li2O2 particles with a LiO2-like surface, which could cause parasitic reactions and hinder the formation of Li2O2. During the charge process, Li2O2 is firstly oxidized from the surface, followed by a delithiation process with a faster oxidation of the bulk by stripping the interlayer Li atoms to form an off-stoichiometric intermediate. This fundamental insight brings new information on the working mechanism of Li-O-2 batteries.									25	2	0	0	3	0	26			1864-5631	1864-564X		WOS:000398838600037	28247542

However, conventional catalysts are mostly based on precious metals, while those based on earth-abundant elements that are efficient in alkaline solution generally suffer from dissolution in such media. Herein, we show that novel manganese silicate-based film materials prepared from thermal vapor deposition and a subsequent microwave reaction can act as potential oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalysts in near-neutral media. Pristine manganese silicate displays excellent intrinsic catalytic activity. With W doping, the catalysts exhibit remarkably better apparent catalytic activity as it leads to the exposure of more active sites without impairing the bulk conductivity. W doping also serves to significantly adjust the elementary valence states of Mn and enrich the surface hydroxyl groups, resulting in much improved stability. DFT calculations reveal that the theoretical overpotential of manganese silicate is comparable to that of other reported manganese oxide OER catalysts. These results demonstrate manganese silicates as a new class of OECs for stable water splitting in near-neutral media. They also illustrate a new pathway of improving stability in near-neutral media by introducing high-valency metal elements for the design of nonprecious OEC.									6	0	0	0	1	0	6			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000683814600001

The Ni2Mo3N/NF catalyst was obtained by annealing a mixture of a Mo precursor, Ni foam, and urea at 600 degrees C under N-2 flow using one-pot synthesis. Moreover, the Ni2Mo3N/NF exhibited high OER activity with low overpotential values (336.38 mV at 50 mA cm(-2) and 392.49 mV at 100 mA cm(-2)) and good stability for 5 h in Fe-purified alkaline electrolyte. The Ni2Mo3N nanoparticle surfaces converted into amorphous surface oxide species during the OER, which might be attributed to the OER activity.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1				1996-1944		WOS:000690977500001	34443289

However, most of the reported bifunctional catalysts are only applicable to alkaline electrolyzer, although a few are effective in acidic or neutral media that appeals more to industrial applications. Here, a lithium-intercalated iridium diselenide (Li-IrSe2) is developed that outperformed other reported catalysts toward overall water splitting in both acidic and neutral environments. Li intercalation activated the inert pristine IrSe2 via bringing high porosities and abundant Se vacancies for efficient hydrogen and oxygen evolution reactions. When Li-IrSe2 was assembled into two-electrode electrolyzers for overall water splitting, the cell voltages at 10 mA cm(-2) were 1.44 and 1.50 V under pH 0 and 7, respectively, being record-low values in both conditions.									72	5	0	0	4	0	72			1433-7851	1521-3773		WOS:000485591500001	31452325

Herein, we report adding Nb to pristine CoP nanowires enhances the material's catalytic activities towards HER and OER. Density functional theory (DFT) calculation unravels that the Nb atoms not only optimize hydrogen binding abilities on CoP surface, but also modulate the surface electron densities of in situ formed b-CoOOH during anodic oxidation, thereby greatly accelerate both the HER and OER kinetics in alkaline solutions. In addition, an alkaline electrolyzer using Nb-doped CoP nanowires as cathode and anode for overall water splitting, delivers 100 mA cm(-2) at low cell voltage of 1.70 V, superior to Pt// RuO2 couple. This doping strategy can be extended to other transition metal phosphides as multifunctional catalysts towards overall water splitting and beyond. (C)& nbsp;2022 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC.

However, very little is known about the catalyst shape dependent activities for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in the cathode of Li-O-2 battery. Hence, we synthesized Pt3Co nanocube (NC) for the comparison with Pt3Co nanoparticle (NP) by regulating the ratio of reducer (hexadecanediol; HDD) amount. Consequently, we could report on very high capacity (10,000 mA h g(carbon)(-1)), superb rate capability (3500 mA h g(caribon)(-1) at 2000 mA g(caribon)(-1)) and high reversibility of Lithium-O-2 batteries using Pt3Co NC catalysts. Particularly, the Pt3Co NCs catalyst exhibited a low OER potential of 3.1 V, providing the highest round trip efficiency of similar to 86.5% at a current density of 200 mA g(caribon)(-1) which is much superior to NPs catalyst.

Here, we report the efficient OER performance of copper and cobalt co-doped Ni3S2 supported on nickle foam (CuCo-Ni3S2/NF). The nanoparticles of Ni3S2 grown on NF are synthesized by simple hydrothermal method and liquid phase vulcanization method. Direct hydrothermal growth results in a strong bonding between CuCo-Ni3S2 and the substrate, which has strong electrical conductivity and long-term stability. The different ratio of copper to cobalt doping has been investigated. The optimized CuCo-Ni3S2/NF (1:1 of molar ratio of copper to cobalt) demonstrates superior catalytic activity to OER in 1.0M KOH with the lowest overpotential of 400 mV at a current density of 100 mA cm(-2). CuCo-Ni3S2/NF has the largest electrochemically active surface area (ECSA) of 513 cm(2) and excellent conductivity. The enhanced mechanisms may be ascribed to the incorporation of copper and the strong electron interaction among copper, cobalt and nickel element. The intrinsic activity of CuCo-Ni3S2/NF may be determined by cobalt and nickel sulfide. This low-cost and efficient electrocatalyst can be used as a promising electrode material for the oxygen evolution reaction.									32	3	0	0	0	0	33			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000498639000013

Here, bifunctional ORR/OER electrocatalysts based on CoxP (0 x < 2, i.e., Co2P, Co2P/CoP mixture, and CoP) nanoparticles (NPs) anchored on N,P-doped carbon framework (CoxP@NPC) are developed via one-step carbonization of the mixture of as-synthesized ZIF-67 and melamine-phytic acid supermolecular aggregate (MPSA). The stoichiometric ratio of resultant CoxP NPs can be rationally designed by adjusting the introduced ratio of ZIF-67 to MPSA, enabling their fabrication in a controlled manner.

Herein, we describe a fast, cost-effective and efficient method to construct an oxygen evolution electrocatalyst with a "bivalve hollow nanoellipsoid" structure, namely three dimensional (3D) bi-shells Co9S8/Fe3O4 embedded in S/N co-decorated hollow carbon nanoellipsoid (H-Co9S8/Fe3O4@SNC). The bivalve metallic compounds hollow structure decreases the proton-electron transfer kinetics on carbon nanoellipsoid, and promoting the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Specifically, the H-Co9S8/Fe3O4@SNC reveals an excellent catalytic activity with a low overpotential of 280 mV at the current density of 10 mA cm(-2) and a small Tafel slope of 87 mV dec(-1).

Following that, the mechanism is investigated and reveal the excellent catalytic activity is mainly owed to the hollow structure and the catalytic synergistic effects of the double shell Co9S8/Fe3O4, simultaneously, the introduction of oxygen vacancy during the pyrolysis process to the formation of Fe3O4.									24	1	0	0	0	0	24			0378-7753	1873-2755		WOS:000440265800007

It was found that the improved electrocatalytic performance of 1D-CoP/3D-NiF for hydrogen and oxygen evolutions was achieved follow-on from more active sites and higher charge-transfer efficiency of the product.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			0957-4522	1573-482X		WOS:000664412700001

Here, we report a bifunctional oxygen electrocatalyst derived from Ni-Fe dual-metal zeolitic imidazole frameworks, Ni3Fe nanoalloys embedded in N-doped carbon (Ni3Fe/N-C) containing carbon nanotube and porous carbon, which exhibits superior oxygen reduction and evolution reaction electrocatalytic performance. For oxygen reduction reaction, the onset potential and the half-wave potential of Ni3Fe/N-C are 0.92 V and 0.85 V, respectively, which are well consistent with those of commercial Pt/C. For oxygen evolution reaction, a low overpotential of 330 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) is obtained for Ni3Fe/N-C, prominently better than that of commercial RuO2/C. Moreover, the oxygen reduction and evolution stability of Ni3Fe/N-C distinctly overmatches that of commercial Pt/C and RuO2/C. Benefiting from the favorable electrocatalytic activity and stability, the rechargeable Zn-air battery based on Ni3Fe/N-C exhibits smaller voltage gap (-0.8 V) than the one based on commercial Pt/C and RuO2/C, and remarkable stability during 300-cycle discharge-charge test. The excellent performance can be attributed to the interaction between Ni3Fe nanoalloy and N-doped carbon, the unique nanostructure composed of carbon nanotube and porous carbons, and high graphitization degree.

Here, we propose that the localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) of silver nanoparticles (Ag NPs) induced the plasmonic thermal and hot electron effects can simultaneously enhance reaction kinetics of ORR, OER, reduce the reaction activation energy and promote the discharge product selectivity to mitigate unfavourable side reactions, which greatly improves the catalytic performance of Ag NPs. Furthermore, we also calculated the photochemical conversion coefficient and the quantitative contribution of the ratio of two effects towards the catalytic activity. Notably, by accelerating both oxygen reduction and evolution reactions, the discharge voltage is significantly increased to 3.2174 V, which is surpass the thermodynamic limit of 2.96 V, and the charge voltage is reduced to 3.2487 V (overpotential of 0.0331 V), resulting in a high round-trip efficiency of 99%. The concept can be extended to other types of batteries, such as Zn-air battery, thus contributing to the development of advanced energy storage systems.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			2405-8297			WOS:000703796200005

The physicochemical properties of the carbon materials were investigated by X-ray Diffraction analysis (XRD), High-Resolution Transmission Electron Microscopy (HRTEM), Raman spectroscopy, X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS), and Cyclic Voltammetry (CV) including the use of a rotating disk electrode (RDE). CV was used to determine capacitance values in the studied materials. The CV and RDE studies for ORR indicate that o-CNOs exhibit better catalytic performance than p-CNOs and MWCNTs. HER studies showed that o-CNOs catalyze the reaction with higher current density values (5 mA.cm(-2) at 0.6 V) and the lowest onset potential (0.43 V) than those observed for the other studied materials. Impedance studies correlated with Tafel analysis, where p-CNOs and o-CNOs are the most active materials for this reaction.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			0925-9635	1879-0062		WOS:000684377500003

However, the practical applications of MOFs for OER are significantly constrained due to their poor charge transfer property and insufficient inherent activity. Herein, we utilized caffeic acid as a bridging agent to covalently bond FeNi-MOF with NiMoO4 in order to tune the charge transfer properties for efficient OER. The optimized organic-inorganic heterocatalyst demonstrates superior OER performance with a low overpotential of 256 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) and long-term stability, outperforming the benchmark IrO2 catalyst and single counterparts. Both experimental and theoretical results indicate that electrons can be transferred from FeNi-MOF to NiMoO4 via a caffeic acid bridging agent, which improves not only the electrical conductivity but also the adsorption capacity of OH- intermediates on MOFs. Therefore, the enhanced OER activity of the heterocatalyst is attributed to the synergistic effects of the multi-components. This study paves the way for the rational design of MOFs-based heterostructures towards efficient electrocatalytic oxygen evolution. (C)& nbsp;2022 Elsevier Inc.

However, wide-scale implementation of this technology demands discovery of new electrode materials that strike a good balance between efficiency, stability, and cost. In the pool of inexpensive electrodes capable of catalyzing hydrogen and oxygen evolution reactions, metal borides/borates have made a big splash in the last decade. However, the research in this family of electrocatalysts remains unorganized owing to the diversity of reports. This review summarizes the past and present research progress in metal borides/borates for electrocatalytic water-splitting. The fundamental reasons for electrochemical behavior in different metal borides/borates are highlighted here, also including some comments regarding erroneous practices in the performance evaluation of metal borides/borates. Various strategies used to enhance the electrocatalytic performance of metal borides/borates are discussed in detail. Different methods evolved over the years for the synthesis of metal borides/borates are also discussed. Finally, an assessment of the commercial viability of metal borides/borates is made and future research directions are suggested.									174	9	0	0	13	0	175			1616-301X	1616-3028		WOS:000493163600001

An iconic member of this type of material is porous graphene. Herein, a unique 2D layered double hydroxide (LDH) nanomesh is designed and synthesized as a new class of 2D holey materials. It represents the first case of exfoliation method for preparing 2D holey materials among all published reports. As an oxygen evolution reaction electrocatalyst, the 2D CoCo-LDH nanomesh has apparently lower onset overpotential (220 mV) than that of compact nanosheets without holes (270 mV) owing to the pores through the plane that offer more highly active edge sites with lower coordination number and promote the mass diffusion. This work opens up a new avenue for designing 2D porous materials for energy conversion and storage.									71	4	0	0	1	0	70			1614-6832	1614-6840		WOS:000454769900018

Microwave-assisted Co-3(CH3COO)(5)(OH) has been used as precursor to increase the surface area of Co3O4. The as-prepared samples were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), Transmission electron microscope (TEM) and scanning electron microscope (SEM). The original Co3O4 (O-Co3O4) nanoparticles have been prepared by annealing of Co-3(CH3COO)(5)(OH). After treatment by NaBH4, O-Co3O4 transforms into the reduced Co3O4 (R-Co3O4). Electrochemical measurements for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) show that R-Co3O4 has more excellent electrocatalytic activity with the lower onset potential of 1.5 V (vs. RHE) and larger current density by over 6.4 times than that of O-Co3O4, which may be ascribed to the more oxygen vacancies derived from reduction treatment of NaBH4. Therefore, increasing the number of oxygen vacancies of metal oxides by facile reduction treatment may be a promising way to prepare the efficient electrocatalysts for OER.

Currently, high efficient electrocatalysts are mainly foused on noble-metal-based materials, which, however, are not suitable for further practical applications due to their high cost and terrestrial scarcity. Herein, we highlighted abundant oxygen vacancy containing Co3O4 quantum dots as an advanced OER electrocatalyst benefiting from the collaborative optimization of active sites and electronic structure by defect engineering. The abundant oxygen vacancy containing Co3O4 quantum dots exhibit excellent catalytic activity for the OER with a lower overpotential (315 mV at 10 mA cm(-2)) along with faster reaction kinetics (Tafel slope of 49 mV dec(-1)) in alkaline medium. Moreover, the stability test shows that after 1000 cycles of cyclic voltammetry (CV), there is about 7 mV positive shift for achieving a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) in the OER, which demonstrates the good stability of the electrocatalyst. Essentially, introducing abundant oxygen vacancies in Co3O4 quantum dots will decrease the valence state of cobalt from Co(iii) to Co(ii) which promotes the formation of the catalytic active center. Moreover, the electronic conductivity test confirms that the electron transfer capability becomes better as the content of oxygen vacancies increases. This work not only provides advanced OER catalysts, but also opens a general avenue for designing low-cost OER catalysts.									49	5	0	0	2	0	50			2052-1553			WOS:000479129600015

Here, we introduce delafossite oxides A 2IrO3 (A = Li, Na, Cu) as a family of oxygen evolution reaction electrocatalysts in alkaline media. We show that, in Cu2IrO3, the intrinsic intersite charge transfer between Cu and Ir improves the electrocatalytic activity by simultaneously increasing the conductivity and reducing the Tafel slope down to 51 mV dec(-1) with an overpotential eta (10) = 361 mV. Through a comparative study, the improved activity of Cu2IrO3 is attributed to the increase of Ir 5d projected electronic density of states with extended Ir-O bond length. This study provides insights into advanced catalyst design through tailoring the active site of oxides by the modulation of electronic states in a given structural motif.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0013-4651	1945-7111		WOS:000800666500001

However, the sluggish kinetics of the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) have limited the practical application of rechargeable metal-air batteries. Most of reviews were focused on single functional electrocatalysts while few on bifunctional electrocatalysts. It is indispensable but challenging to design a bifunctional electrocatalyst that is active and stable to the two reactions. Recently, attempts to develop high active bifunctional electrocatalysts for both ORR and OER increase rapidly. Much work is focused on the micro-nano design of advanced structures to improve the performance of bifunctional electrocatalyst. Transition-metal materials, carbon materials and composite materials, and the methods developed to prepare micro-nano structures, such as electrochemical methods, chemical vapor deposition, hydrothermal methods and template methods are reported in literatures. Additionally, many strategies, such as adjustments of electronic structures, oxygen defects, metal-oxygen bonds, interfacial strain, nano composites, heteroatom doping etc., have been used extensively to design bifunctional electrocatalysts. To well understand the achievements in the recent literatures, this review focuses on the micro-nano structural design of materials, and the related methods and strategies are classed into two groups for the improvement of intrinsic and apparent activities. The fine adjustment of nano structures and an in-depth understanding of the reaction mechanism are also discussed briefly. (C) 2020, Dalian Institute of Chemical Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences.

However, the sluggish kinetics caused by insufficient active surface and limited charge transfer hinder OER's wide applications. In this work, a novel selftemplating strategy for the fabrication of composite CoO-MoO2 nanocages with enhanced OER performance is proposed. By designing a nanocage structure and incorporating conductive MoO2 to promote both mass and charge transfer, high OER activity (eta = 312 mV at 10 mA cm(-2)) as well as good stability in the resulting CoO-MoO2 composite nanostructure can be achieved. This versatile synthetic strategy can also be extended to other metals (such as W) to provide greater opportunities for the controlled fabrication of mixed metal oxide nanostructures for electrochemical applications.									191	8	0	0	1	0	194			1616-301X	1616-3028		WOS:000410162200015

Contact angle measurements reveal a spreading interface during ORR, whereas the droplet figure remains unchanged during OER. The microscopy results demonstrated the formation of many fine droplets in the vicinity of the meniscus boundary during ORR, which was attributed to vapor condensation on the surface. Correlation of these observations with electrochemical data and differences in the results between ORR and OER suggest that the motion of the three-phase interface is induced by local pH and temperature gradients in the meniscus, presumably caused by ORR uniformity under the limitation of dissolved oxygen.

Confinement engineering is the most effective strategy for the precise chemical synthesis of electrocatalysts through the modulation of electron transfer properties, atomic arrangement, and molecular structure in a confined region. It not only alters the coordination environments to adjust the formation mechanism of active centers, but also regulates the physicochemical properties of electrocatalysts. Consequently, the nucleation, transportation, and stabilization of intermediate species in electrocatalysis are optimized, and then improve the performance covering activity, stability, and selectivity. In this review, confinement engineering is introduced in terms of confined definition, classification, construction, and basic principles. Then, the latest advances in the confinement engineering of electrocatalysts for the oxygen reduction reaction, hydrogen evolution reaction, oxygen evolution reaction, nitrogen reduction reaction, and carbon dioxide reduction reaction are systematically evaluated. Furthermore, using representative experimental results and theoretical calculations, the structure-activity relationships between confinement engineering and electrocatalytic performance are illustrated. Finally, potential challenges and future development prospects of confined electrocatalysts are highlighted, with a focus on controlling the construction of confined environments, investigating uncommon catalytic properties in confined regions, and practical applications.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			1616-301X	1616-3028		WOS:000851859600001

Herein, based on the density functional theory calculation, the ORR/OER activity of the functional graphene is systematically investigated where the 3d transition metal elements (Sc, Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu and Zn) are selected as the doping components, aiming to screen out the efficient candidates for the oxygen electrocatalysis.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			1452-3981			WOS:000455046500047

Herein, ultra-small and nitrogen-doped molybdenum carbide (N-Mo2C) nanoparticles with oxidized surfaces are facilely synthesized with the assistance of cationic surfactants and simultaneously anchored onto three-dimensional nitrogen-doped flower-like carbon nanospheres (NFCNS), and the N-Mo2C/NFCNS composites are further investigated as HER electrocatalysts. Analysis results reveal that nitrogen atoms are doped into both the lattice and the carbon framework of Mo2C, resulting in low desorption energy of Mo-H bond for the easy evolution of hydrogen gas. Moreover, the high specific area of NFCNS enables enrichment of N-Mo2C nanoparticles, and its open framework facilitates fast ion diffusion. As a result, the N-Mo2C/NFCNS composites exhibit impressive HER activities with low overpotential, small Tafel slope, and excellent durability in both acidic and alkaline media, which outperform most of the reported Mo-based HER catalysts and are also highly comparable to the commercial Pt/C catalyst. Not limited to HER electrocatalysts, this work should open a new avenue for tailoring highly-efficient carbon/metal compounds-based electrocatalysts for oxygen reduction reaction, oxygen evolution reaction, nitrogen reduction reaction, etc.									30	1	0	0	0	0	30			2211-2855	2211-3282		WOS:000672565700004

Understanding the mechanistic origin of the different activities and stabilities of Ir-based catalysts is, therefore, crucial for a scale-up of green hydrogen production. It is known that structure influences the dissolution, which is the main degradation mechanism and shares common intermediates with the OER. In this Minireview, the state-of-the-art understanding of dissolution and its relationship with the structure of different iridium catalysts is gathered and correlated to different mechanisms of the OER. A perspective on fixture directions of investigation is also given.									8	0	0	0	0	0	8			1433-7851	1521-3773		WOS:000753274600001	34942052

The results proved that the presence of phosphorus vacancies is a crucial factor enabling formation of Co-O-C bonds. The direct coupling of edge Co of CoP with the oxygen from functional groups on the carbon layer was proposed. As a catalyst for electrocatalytic water splitting, the manufactured Fe2O3@C@CoP core-shell structure manifested a low overpotential of 230 mV, a low Tafel slope of 55 mV dec(-1), and long-term stability. Density functional theory calculations verified that the Co-O-C bond played a critical role in decreasing the thermodynamic energy barrier of reaction rate-determining step for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). This synthetic route might be extended to construct metal-O-C bonds in other transition metal phosphides (or selenides, sulfides)/carbon composites for highly efficient OER catalysts.									10	0	0	0	0	0	10			1864-5631	1864-564X		WOS:000634975100001	33650205

This study reports the first application of Co(2)YZ-type Heusler compounds as electrocatalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). A range of Co(2)YZ crystals was synthesized through the arc-melting method and the e(g) orbital filling of Co was precisely regulated by varying Y and Z sites of the compound. A correlation between the e(g) orbital filling of reactive Co sites and OER activity was found for Co(2)MnZ compounds (Z=Ti, Al, V, and Ga), whereby higher catalytic current was achieved for e(g) orbital filling approaching unity. A similar trend of e(g) orbital filling on the reactivity of cobalt sites was also observed for other Heusler compounds (Co(2)VZ, Z=Sn and Ga). This work demonstrates proof of concept in the application of Heusler compounds as a new class of OER electrocatalysts, and the influence of the manipulation of the spin orbitals on their catalytic performance.									12	1	0	0	0	0	12			1433-7851	1521-3773		WOS:000614351500001	33300643

Here the authors introduce Fe-In-S clusters onto the surface of photoanode to effectively lower the electrochemical reaction barrier.Vast bulk recombination of photo-generated carriers and sluggish surface oxygen evolution reaction (OER) kinetics severely hinder the development of photoelectrochemical water splitting. Herein, through constructing a vertically ordered ZnInS nanosheet array with an interior gradient energy band as photoanode, the bulk recombination of photogenerated carriers decreases greatly. We use the atomic layer deposition technology to introduce Fe-In-S clusters into the surface of photoanode. First-principles calculations and comprehensive characterizations indicate that these clusters effectively lower the electrochemical reaction barrier on the photoanode surface and promote the surface OER reaction kinetics through precisely affecting the second and third steps (forming processes of O* and OOH*) of the four-electron reaction. As a result, the optimal photoanode exhibits the high performance with a significantly enhanced photocurrent of 5.35 mA cm(-2) at 1.23 V-RHE and onset potential of 0.09 V-RHE. Present results demonstrate a robust platform for controllable surface modification, nanofabrication, and carrier transport.									11	0	0	0	0	0	11				2041-1723		WOS:000695649500009	34475386

Fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) electrodes modified with hematite nanorod (450 nm of thickness) showed a photocurrent with 0.9 mA cm(-2) at 0.4 V vs Ag/AgCl. Also, we have done electrochemical characterizations under dark conditions in order to understand the catalytic properties of the photoanode. Based on cyclic voltammetry results we have proposed a new mechanism to explain the evolution of molecular oxygen onto oriented hematite surfaces, in which is not inconsistent with thermodynamical parameters extracted from the Pourbaix diagram. A chemical interaction between OH- and iron oxide from the surface suggested that the chemical reaction is first governed by oxy-hydroxides on the electrode/electrolyte interface. In other word, molecular oxygen evolution is preceded by the formation of oxy-hydroxide groups, a slow and possibly limiting step. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

The catalysts were characterized using techniques such as XRD, SEM, TEM, FTIR spectroscopy and cyclic as well as linear voltametry measurements. The results indicated that chemically synthesized Mo-x(CO)(n) does not possesses much catalytic activity for oxygen reduction. But it may be used as catalyst for hydrogen evolution reaction. Incorporation of sulfur to the carbonyl compound seems to nullify the catalytic activity of the material. Mo-x(CO)(n) is formed in amorphous form, where as, addition of sulfur to this material transforms it into polycrystalline in nature.

Herein, a pollen biomass-derived carbon electrocatalyst with a three-dimensional porous framework, coupled with uniform distribution of FeSe nanoparticles, has been prepared by pyrolysis of the pollen precursor, followed by selenylation. The optimal catalyst FeSe/NC-PoFeSe exhibits a superb ORR activity with a half-wave potential of 0.86 V versus a reversible hydrogen electrode and OER activity with a low overpotential (330 mV at 10 mA cm(-2)) in alkaline media, compared with commercial Pt/C and IrO2/C catalysts, respectively. On the basis of the characterization results, we ascribe the enhanced ORR performance to sufficient Fe-N-x, pyridinic N, and graphitic N and the excellent OER performance in the presence of FeSe nanoparticles uniformly mounted on the N-doped carbon materials. In addition, we believe that the coupling effect between the FeSe nanoparticles and biocarbon led to a further improvement in the electrochemical performance. Significantly, the prominent ORR and OER stability of FeSe/NC-PoFeSe shows great promise in renewable energy devices.									20	2	0	0	3	0	20			1944-8244			WOS:000446142100034	30178660

Although much effort has been devoted to the development of improved bifunctional electrocatalysts, an inexpensive, highly active oxygen electrocatalyst, however, remains to be a challenge. In this paper, we present a facile and robust method to create gently reduced graphene oxide incorporated into cobalt oxalate microstructures (CoC2O4/gRGO) and demonstrate its excellent and stable electrocatalytic activity in both OER and ORR, arising from the inherent properties of the components and their physicochemical interaction. Our synthesis technique also explores a single pot method to partially reduce graphene oxide and form CoC2O4 structures while maintaining the solution processability of reduced graphene oxide. While the OER activity of CoC2O4/gRGO is exclusively due to CoC2O4, which transformed into OER-active Co species, the combination with gRGO significantly improves OER stability. On the other hand, CoC2O4/gRGO exhibits synergistic effect towards ORR, via a quasi-four-electron pathway, leading to a slightly higher ORR limiting current than Pt/C. Remarkably, gRGO offers dual functionality, contributing to ORR activity via the N-functional groups and also enhancing OER stability through the gRGO coating around CoC2O4 structures. Our results suggest a new class of metal-carbon composite that has the potential to be alternative bifunctional catalysts for regenerative fuel cells and metal-air batteries. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Herein, we focus on an effect that is usually neglected, namely, how the local reaction conditions are shaped by nonspecifically adsorbed cations. We scrutinize the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) at nickel (oxy)hydroxide catalysts, using a physicochemical model that integrates density functional theory calculations, a microkinetic submodel, and a mean-field submodel of the electric double layer. The aptness of the model is verified by comparison with experiments. The robustness of model-based insights against uncertainties and variations in model parameters is examined, with a sensitivity analysis using Monto Carlo simulations. We interpret the decrease in OER activity with the increasing effective size of electrolyte cations as a consequence of cation overcrowding near the negatively charged electrode surface. The same reasoning could explain why the OER activity increases with solution pH on the RHE scale and why the OER activity decreases in the presence of bivalent cations. Overall, this work stresses the importance of correctly accounting for local reaction conditions in electrocatalytic reactions to obtain an accurate picture of factors that determine the electrode activity.									8	0	0	0	0	0	8				2691-3704		WOS:000711198900024	34723278

Herein, the reduced graphene oxide-supported MoO42- modified amorphous cobalt metaphosphate cubes (a-Co(PO3)2/MoO4/rGO) as bifunctional OER/HER catalyst is prepared by anion exchange and phosphating, using the Prussian blue analogue (PBA) as a precursor. The resulting composite exhibits the low overpotentials (g) that of 290 and 50 mV for OER and HER in 1.0 M KOH solution at 10 mA cm-2, respectively. The electrochemical test and density functional theory (DFT) results reveal that the MoO42--modified optimizes the adsorption/desorption energy of H* of Co(PO3)2, thus enhance the HER activity. Benefiting from efficient HER and OER performances, an efficient and stable alkaline water electrolysis operation using a-Co(PO3)2/MoO4/rGO used as bifunctional catalyst can be carried out, which can deliver a current density (j) of 20 mA cm-2 at 1.65 V cell voltage and work continuously for 24 h.

Oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) play a paramount role in the operation of these devices, but are notoriously sluggish even with precious metals-based catalysts. Here we report our findings in the development of a bifunctional catalyst based on phosphorus-doped LaFeO3-delta for ORR and OER in alkaline solutions. The remarkable electrocatalytic performance is attributed to larger amount of O-2(2-)/O- species, trace amount of Fe4+ species, and optimized e(g) electron filling (approximate to 1), benefiting from the doping effect of phosphorus. Both the mass activity and the specific activity are nearly doubled after P-doping. Density functional theory calculations also confirm that the increase in valence state of Fe ions is due mainly to phosphorus doping. These results demonstrate that non-metal element doping is an effective approach to optimizing the electronic configuration, changing valence states of ions, and thus enhancing activities of perovskite electrocatalysts.									130	11	0	0	11	0	132			2211-2855	2211-3282		WOS:000430057000020

Herein, we have developed a transformation method for growing NiMn-based bimetal-organic framework (NiMn-MOF) nanosheets on multi-channel carbon fibers (MCCF) as a bifunctional oxygen electrocatalyst. Owing to the desired components and architecture, the MCCF/NiMn-MOFs manifest comparable electrocatalytic performance towards oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) with the commercial Pt/C electrocatalyst and superior performance towards oxygen evolution reaction (OER) to the benchmark RuO(2)electrocatalyst.

Herein, we report three-dimension (3D) Rosa centifolia-like CeO2 encapsulated with N-doped carbon (NC) composites (CeO2@NC) for enhancing oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activities. This synthetic method allows CeO2 to tune the oxygen vacancy concentration and electronic structure of a series of CeO2@NC catalysts due to its large oxygen-storage-capacity (OSC) property. Moreover, benefiting from the exposed active sites in NC as well as the synergy between CeO2 and NC, among as-prepared samples, the resultant CeO2@NC-900 delivers a half-wave potential (E-1/2) of 0.854 V, which is more positive compared with counterpart of NC-900 (0.806 V) and even comparable to that of commercial Pt/C catalyst (0.855 V). This indicates that the ORR electrocatalytic activity of CeO2@NC-900 is significantly improved. Meanwhile, CeO2@NC-900 exhibits satisfactory performance toward OER. For practical application, the CeO2@NC-900 involved rechargeable Zn-air battery possesses excellent energy efficiency, superior stability, and large energy density (666.1 Wh kg(Zn)(-1) at 5 mA cm(-2)). This approach provides a valid way to develop advanced rare earth oxides-based materials for energy applications. (C) 2020 Elsevier Inc.

Tremendous efforts have been devoted to exploring highly efficient and abundant metal oxide electrocatalysts for oxygen evolution and hydrogen evolution reactions to lower the energy consumption in water splitting. In this review, we summarize the recent advances on the development of metal oxide electrocatalysts with special emphasis on the structural engineering of nanostructures from particle size, composition, crystalline facet, hybrid structure as well as the conductive supports. The special strategies relay on the transformation from the metal organic framework and ion exchange reactions for the preparation of novel metal oxide nanostructures with boosting the catalytic activities are also discussed.

The oxide catalysts followed the rhombohedral hexagonal crystal geometry. Sr-substitution (0.2-0.4 mol) increased the oxide roughness as well as the apparent electrocatalytic activity greatly. The oxygen evolution on each oxide catalyst showed two Tafel slopes, one (b(1) congruent to 65 mV/decade) at low and the other (b(2) congruent to 103 mV/decade) at higher overpotentials. The reaction order w. r. t. OH- concentration was approximately unity.

The high charge overpotential, in particular, not only causes problems by increasing the possibility of electrolyte decomposition but also induces a low round-trip efficiency and coulombic efficiency. Here, by choosing the right component proportion in Pt-Cu bimetallic electrocatalysts that optimize electrocatalytic activity of electrochemical reactions, especially of oxygen evolution reactions, a superior electrochemical behavior is demonstrated, with a low charge overpotential of 0.2 V and cycleability of 50 discharge/charge cycles before capacity fading. The optimized Pt-Cu bimetallic electrocatalysts significantly reduce the charge overpotential and furthermore enhance the efficiency, stability, and cycleability of an aprotic Li-O-2 battery.									22	0	0	0	1	0	22			1614-6832	1614-6840		WOS:000438706700003

J	Schwab, Josiah; Quataert, Eliot; Bildsten, Lars								Thermal runaway during the evolution of ONeMg cores towards accretion-induced collapse								MONTHLY NOTICES OF THE ROYAL ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY				453	2			1910	1927		10.1093/mnras/stv1804				OCT 21 2015	2015	We study the evolution of degenerate electron cores primarily composed of the carbon burning products O-16, Ne-20, and Mg-24 (hereafter ONeMg cores) that are undergoing compression. Electron capture reactions on A = 20 and 24 isotopes reduce the electron fraction and heat the core. We develop and use a new capability of the Modules for Experiments in Stellar Astrophysics (MESA) stellar evolution code that provides a highly accurate implementation of these key reactions. These new accurate rates and the ability of MESA to perform extremely small spatial zoning demonstrates a thermal runaway in the core triggered by the temperature and density sensitivity of the Ne-20 electron capture reactions. Both analytics and numerics show that this thermal runaway does not trigger core convection, but rather leads to a centrally concentrated (r < km) thermal runaway that will subsequently launch an oxygen deflagration wave from the centre of the star. We use MESA to perform a parameter study that quantifies the influence of the Mg-24 mass fraction, the central temperature, the compression rate, and uncertainties in the electron capture reaction rates on the ONeMg core evolution. This allows us to establish a lower limit on the central density at which the oxygen deflagration wave initiates of rho(c) greater than or similar to 8.5 x 10(9) g cm(-3). Based on previous work and order-of-magnitude calculations, we expect objects which ignite oxygen at or above these densities to collapse and form a neutron star. Calculations such as these are an important step in producing more realistic progenitor models for studies of the signature of accretion-induced collapse.									71	3	0	0	0	0	71			0035-8711	1365-2966		WOS:000363486000058

It is synthesized by a mixed solvothermal approach and characterized by physicochemical techniques. Cubic shaped particles of MgCoSiO4 are observed in microscopy images. The catalytic activity of MgCoSiO4 is studied in alkaline (KOH solution) and neutral (phosphate buffer solutions) media. The effects of the electrolyte concentration and loading level on OER are studied. Additionally, the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) of MgCoSiO4 is studied in aqueous and non-aqueous electrolytes. Oxygen follows the 4e(-) and 1e(-) reduction pathways in aqueous and non-aqueous electrolytes, respectively. Li-O-2 cells are assembled with MgCoSiO4 as the oxygen electrode catalyst in non-aqueous electrolyte and subjected to charge-discharge cycling at several current densities. A discharge capacity of 7221 mA h g(-1) (8.272 mA h cm(-2)) was obtained at 0.3 mA cm(-2). The results suggest that MgCoSiO4 is a good non-platinum based catalyst, which is useful for Li-O-2 cells.									8	0	0	0	0	0	8			2044-4753	2044-4761		WOS:000382025300028

In this study, a novel, unconventional, one-step self-regulating acid-etching strategy was developed to prepare two-tiered hierarchical Fe-doped and Pt-decorated nickel hydroxide nanosheets selectively for efficient oxygen evolution and hydrogen evolution reactions. The combinatorial hydrolysis of Ni ions in a self-limiting acidic environment induces selective growth of disparate dimension nanosheets. The proposed strategy, avoiding multifold structural design challenges, delivers highly exposed active sites and robust catalyst/support interfaces. Moreover, the exquisite structure and synergetic heterostructure modulation afford kinetically favorable electrolyte mass transport, and gas bubble release. Consequently, the structurally well-designed and hetero-coordinated electrodes attest highly efficient oxygen evolution with a low Tafel slope of 70.6 mV dec(-1) and overpotential of 300 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2), while it 30.4 mV dec(-1) and 37 mV for hydrogen evolution, which rival performances of state-of-the-art electrocatalysts.									20	2	0	0	1	0	20			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000416340300014

However, it is a big challenge to introduce defects into ultrafine catalysts because of the surface tension and self-purification effect of the nanoparticles. In the present work, physical laser fragmentation with chemical oxidization reaction is combined to synthesize Co3O4 nanoparticles (L-CO) with ultrasmall size (approximate to 2.1 nm) as well as abundant oxygen vacancies, thus providing an effective solution to the long-standing contradiction between the size reduction and defect generation. The ultrasmall particle size allows more catalytic sites to be exposed. The surficial oxygen vacancies enhance the intrinsic activity, while the internal oxygen vacancies improve the electron transfer, and all of these benefits make L-CO an active and durable bifunctional catalyst for oxygen reduction/evolutions. As the air cathode of zinc-air battery, L-CO displays excellent rechargeable performance with a power density of approximate to 337 mW cm(-2), outperforming the commercial noble metal couple (Pt/C+RuO2).									78	6	0	0	4	0	79			1616-301X	1616-3028		WOS:000474472200001

Herein, a series of hierarchical ZnCo2O4/Co3O4/NC-CNT (NC-CNT=nitrogen-rich carbon nanotube) mesoporous dodecahedrons grafted to carbon nanotubes have been synthesized from ZnCo bimetallic zeolitic imidazolate frameworks (ZnCo-ZIFs) through sequential pyrolysis in nitrogen and mild oxidation in air. The simultaneous modulation of oxygen vacancies, composition, and hierarchical mesoporous architecture remarkably enhanced their electronic conduction and the amount and reactivity of accessible actives; thus boosting their intrinsic activity in the OER. The optimal ZnCo2O4/Co3O4/NC-CNT-700 sample exhibited a large current density of 50 mA cm(-2) at a potential of 1.65 V, a small Tafel slope of 88.5 mV dec(-1), and superior stability in alkaline media.

The standard carbon-manganese steel was phosphorized superficially, which led to the formation of a unique 3 D interconnected nanoporous surface with a high specific area that facilitated the electrocatalytically initiated oxygen evolution reaction. The prepared 3 D S235-P steel exhibited enhanced electrocatalytic OER activities in the alkaline regime, as confirmed by a low overpotential (326 mV at a 10 mA cm(-2)) and a small Tafel slope of 68.7 mV dec(-1). Moreover, the catalyst was found to be stable under long-term usage conditions, functioning as an oxygen-evolving electrode at pH 13, as evidenced by the sufficient charge-to-oxygen conversion rate (faradaic efficiency: 82.11 and 88.34% at 10 and 5mAcm(-2), respectively). In addition, it turned out that the chosen surface modification delivered steel S235 as an OER electrocatalyst that was stable under neutral pH conditions. Our investigation revealed that the high catalytic activities likely stemmed from the generated Fe/(Mn) hydroxide/oxohydroxides generated during the OER process. Phosphorization treatment therefore not only is an efficient way to optimize the electrocatalytic performance of standard carbon-manganese steel but also enables for the development of low-costing and abundant steels in the field of energy conversion.									20	1	0	0	1	0	20			1864-5631	1864-564X		WOS:000448064300014	30095243

While previous studies have shown the catalytic performance can be greatly benefited from incorporating multiple elements, high-entropy polyanionic materials such as high-entropy phosphates (HEPi) have never been reported due to the harsh synthetic requirement of a short high-temperature heating duration. Herein we for the first time report the synthesis of HEPi catalyst (i.e., CoFeNiMnMoPi) in the form of highly uniform spherical particles through a high-temperature fly-through method. Our approach enables (1) uniformly confined metal and phosphorous precursors in one aerosol droplet, (2) in-sita oxide-tophosphate transformation at high temperature, and (3) homogenous mixing of multi-metallic elements in a phosphate structure in milliseconds. As a proof-of-concept, we apply the HEPi catalyst in a model oxygen evolution reaction (OER), where much lower overpotential (270 mV at 10 mA cm-2) and faster kinetics (Tafel slope of 74 mV dec-1) were measured compared to the commercial IrOx and the high-entropy oxide (HEO) counterpart. This study paves a new way toward synthesizing a library of high-entropy polyanionic compounds for a range of applications in energy and catalysis.									28	0	0	0	1	0	28			2211-2855	2211-3282		WOS:000672567700005

The films were adherent and of p-type semiconducting. Cyclic voltammetric studies indicated the formation of a quasireversible surface redox couple, Ni(III)/Ni(II), on these films before the onset of oxygen evolution in 1 m KOH. The anodic Tafel slopes were approximately 40 and approximately 65 mV decade-1, on the sprayed LaNiO3 film and on the film obtained by a layer method, respectively. The reaction order with respect to OH- was found to be 2.2 on the sprayed oxide film and 1.2 on the layer film. The sprayed oxide film was found to be electrocatalytically more active. It is suggested that the oxygen evolution reaction proceeds on both the film electrodes via the formation of the physisorbed H2O2 as an intermediate in the rate determining step.									46	0	0	0	1	1	46			0021-891X			WOS:A1994MW00300009

Herein, we have synthesized tri-metal-based FeMoV oxide nanosheets on three- dimensional nickel foam (FeMoV/NF) for the OER by a simple hydrothermal method. Thanks to the decreased charge-transfer resistance and modified electronic structure, the optimized Fe0.5Mo0.1V0.4/NF electrode exhibits excellent OER performance with a low overpotential of 296 mV to deliver a current density of 100 mA cm(-2) and a small Tafel slope of 48.9 mV dec(-1) in a 1 M KOH solution; both values are much lower than those of commercial RuO2 supported on nickel foam (392 mV and 129 mV dec(-1), respectively). This work may provide a promising strategy for the design of highly efficient and low-cost electrocatalysts for the OER.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2574-0962			WOS:000731064000001

In this study, we employ electrochemical methods and synchrotron techniques to systematically investigate interactions between metal oxides and noble metals that lead to enhanced OER catalysis for water oxidation. In particular, we synthesize porous MnOx films together with nanoparticles of Au, Pd, Pt, or Ag and observe significant improvement in activity for the combined catalysts. Soft X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) shows that increased activity correlates with increased Mn oxidation states to 4+ under OER conditions compared to bare MnOx, which exhibits minimal OER current and remains in a 3+ oxidation state. Thickness studies of bare MnOx films and of MnOx films deposited on Au nanoparticles reveal trends suggesting that the enhancement in activity arises from interfacial sites between Au and MnOx.									81	0	0	0	7	0	81			1948-7185			WOS:000363083900031	26722794

It has been found for the Ag/HAP/Pt contact that at negative potentials on Ag, molecular oxygen reduction currents are observed, which are limited by O-2 diffusion to silver. Anode reaction on silver is a formation reaction of Ag+ ions which accumulate near the interface by ion-exchange. At negative potentials on Pt, molecular oxygen reduction currents were also observed; at positive potentials on Pt, there was an oxygen evolution due to crystal water decomposition. The U voltage value generated in the Ag/HAP/Pt system at an O-2 pressure of 1 atm and 18 degrees C was 0.48 V. Increase in U values with rising temperature is attributed to the temperature dependence of the overpotential of oxygen reduction on Pt.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0167-2738			WOS:A1997YA31400011

In this work, Co3O4 nanoparticles with narrow size distribution were uniformly deposited onto graphene oxide materials with different reduction degrees, by using a microwave-assisted hydrothermal method. The physicochemical characterization of these nanocomposites indicates that oxygenated groups grafted onto a reduced graphene oxide surface allow creating strong interactions between the carbon-based substrate and Co3O4 nanocrystals. The obtained results denote that the electrocatalytic activity and stability of these nanocomposites toward the ORR and OER depend on the entanglement between the strength of the carbon/oxide interaction and the electronic conductivity of the substrate.

The sluggish kinetics of water-splitting reactions, namely, hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER), however, remains a bottleneck to the water electrolysis technology. High-entropy materials, due to their compositional flexibility, structural stability, and synergy between various elemental components, have recently aroused considerable interest in catalyzing the water-splitting reactions. Herein, a timely review of the recent achievements is provided in high-entropy materials for water electrolysis. An overview of different kinds of high-entropy materials for catalyzing the HER and OER half-reactions is introduced, followed by a discussion of theoretical and experimental efforts in understanding the fundamental origins of the enhanced catalytic performance observed on high-entropy catalysts. Various materials design strategies, including control of size and shape, construction of a porous structure, engineering of defect, and formation of hybrid/composite structure, to develop high-entropy catalysts with improved catalytic performance are highlighted. Finally, the remaining challenges are pointed out and the corresponding perspectives to address these challenges are put forward to promote the development of the research field of high-entropy water-splitting catalysts.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			2194-4288	2194-4296		WOS:000854300300001

Compared with other catalysis reactions, a relatively larger activation barrier for oxygen evolution/reduction reactions (OER/ORR), where multiple electron transfers are involved, is noted. Many works over the past decade thus have been focused on the atomic-scale control of the surface structure and the precise identification of surface composition change in catalyst materials to achieve better conversion efficiency. In particular, recent advances in various analytical tools have enabled noteworthy findings of unexpected catalytic features at atomic resolution, providing significant insights toward reducing the activation barriers and subsequently improving the catalytic performance. In addition to summarizing important surface issues, including lattice defects, related to the OER and ORR in this Review, we present the current status and discuss future perspectives of oxide- and alloy-based catalysts in terms of atomic-scale observation and manipulation.									22	2	0	0	3	0	22			1936-0851	1936-086X		WOS:000595533800005	33151068

The reaction rate was significantly influenced by the oxygen partial pressure and the gas flow rate. Little evolution of CO gas was observed in the initial 5 seconds of the oxidation; however, this was followed by a period of high evolution rate of CO gas. The partial pressure of CO gas decreased with further progress of the decarbonization. The overall reaction is decomposed to two elementary reactions: the decarbonization and the dissolution rate of oxygen. The assumptions were made that these reactions are at equilibrium and that the reaction rates are controlled by mass transfer rates within and around the gas bubble. The time variations of carbon and oxygen contents in the melt and the CO partial pressure in the off-gas under various bubbling conditions were well explained by the mathematical model. Based on the present model, it was explained that the decarbonization rate of molten iron was controlled by gas-phase mass transfer at the first stage of reaction, but the rate controlling step was transferred to liquid-phase mass transfer from one third of reaction time.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			1738-8228			WOS:000263762800006

Technical issues associated with lithium-air batteries, however, are rather complex. Apart from the sluggish oxygen reaction kinetics which demand efficient oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalysts, issues are also inherited from the nature of an open battery system and the use of reactive metal lithium as anode. Lithium-air batteries, which exchange oxygen directly with ambient air, face more challenges due to the additional oxidative agents of moisture, carbon dioxide, etc. which degrade the metal lithium anode, deteriorating the performance of the batteries. In order to improve the cycling performance one must hold a full picture of lithium-oxygen electrochemistry in the presence of carbon dioxide and/or moisture and fully understand the fundamentals of chemistry reactions therein. Recent advances in the exploration of the effect of moisture and CO2 contaminants on Li-O-2 batteries are reviewed, and the mechanistic understanding of discharge/charge process in O-2 at controlled level of moisture and/or CO2 are illustrated. Prospects for development opportunities of Li-air batteries, insight into future research directions, and guidelines for the further development of rechargeable Li-air batteries are also given.									236	9	0	0	5	0	237			1614-6832	1614-6840		WOS:000379306400005

Nickel phosphides are a promising catalysts family and are known to develop a thin active layer of oxidized Ni in an alkaline medium. Here, Ni12P5 was recognized as a suitable platform for the electrochemical production of gamma-NiOOH-a particularly active phase-because of its matching crystallographic structure. The incorporation of tungsten by doping produces additional surface roughness, increases the electrochemical surface area (ESCA), and reduces the energy barrier for electron-coupled water dissociation (the Volmer step for the formation of H-ads). When serving as both the anode and cathode, the 15% W-Ni12P5 catalyst provides an overall water splitting current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at a cell voltage of only 1.73 V with good durability, making it a promising bifunctional catalyst for practical water electrolysis.									7	0	0	0	0	0	7			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000737859500001	34963045

Herein, Pt/Fe was grown on gold (Au) nanorods by a simple wet-chemistry process, producing either dumbbell-like nanorods (Pt/Fe-Au) or core-shell nanorods (Au@Pt/Fe). Using hydrogen evolution reaction as a model, these nano-structures were examined as an electrocatalyst with/without light irradiation. As a result, dumbbell-like nanorods exhibited the best performance under light irradiation due to plasmon-induced enhancement. Then, CV curves, activation energy at zero potential, i-t responses to light irradiation and j-t evolution revealed that the plasmon-excited electron-transfer rather than the photothermal effect resulted in the electrocatalysis enhancement. This enhancement was also demonstrated for oxygen evolution reaction, suggesting its great potential in other electrocatalysis applications.									30	0	0	0	2	0	30			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000431621700006

The obtained products are characterized by various techniques, and their electrocatalytic performances are also assessed by the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). According to the electrochemical characterization, it is demonstrated that ZNCO-0.15 (i.e., Zn0.15Ni0.85Co2O4) nanoflowers show a lower overpotential, smaller Tafel slope, higher electrochemical active surface area (ECSA), as well as a larger turnover frequency (TOF) value than those of Co3O4, NiCo2O4, and ZnCo2O4 nanoflowers, indicating that introduction of an optimal content of zinc ions plays an important role in enhancing electrocatalytic performances for OER. The enhanced OER performance of ZNCO-0.15 could be attributed to the increased number of active sites (Co3+), accelerated kinetic rate, and promoted conductivity of the catalyst with the incorporation of zinc ions.									36	5	0	0	2	0	37			0947-6539	1521-3765		WOS:000443382500032	29893018

They represent one of the most promising future power sources. However, many barriers restrict their application on a large scale. One of the main challenges is the sluggish rates of the oxygen-reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen-evolution reaction (OER), which govern the discharging and charging processes of the battery, respectively. Here, recent advances related to oxygen electrocatalyst materials for ZABs are discussed. Detailed discussions will focus on unifunctional ORR electrocatalysts and bifunctional ORR and OER electrocatalysts. Pt-based nanomaterials, as the best ORR electrocatalysts, possess the virtue of high activity, but have the disadvantages of high cost, scarcity, and poor stability. Thus, materials based on transition metals (alloys, metal oxides, metal nitrides, and spinel oxides) and metal-free materials are widely investigated as nonprecious ORR catalysts owing to their promising catalytic activities. As for bifunctional ORR and OER electrocatalysts, the following two categories are introduced: (i) metal-based materials, including single metal/metal-oxides-based materials and mixed-metal/metal-oxides-based materials; and (ii) metal-free materials. Finally, perspectives on the continuous research and limitation of the current ZAB technology are provided.									160	13	0	0	8	0	160			2366-9608			WOS:000417489400009

Here we synthesized a telluride (Te)-doped porous carbon catalyst (ZnCo-Te@NC) through pyrolyzing ZnCo-MOF-coated Te nanotubes. The as-prepared ZnCo-Te@NC exhibited excellent bi-functional electrocatalytic performance with an impressive half-wave potential (E-1/2 ) of 0.873 V for ORR and a low overpotential of 400 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) for OER, outperforming most non-noble metal-based catalysts previously reported. When using ZnCo-Te@NC as the air cathode catalyst in a self-assembled battery, it demonstrated smaller charge-discharge voltage gap (0.932 V at 50 mA cm(-2)) and higher peak power density (259.7 mW cm(-2)) with robust long-term (100 h) cycle stability, surpassing the benchmark precious metal catalyst-based batteries. This is the first report that telluride has been doped into a highly graphitized porous carbon for use in zinc-air batteries. This work provides an effective strategy to develop high graphitized carbon materials by telluride modification to enhance the performance of bifunctional electrocatalysts for Zn-air batteries.

Herein, N,P co-doped hollow carbon nanofiber (N,P-HCNF) membranes were facilely prepared via coaxial electrospinning technology, which are bestowed with a hierarchical porous architecture, turbostratic structures, and abundant catalytically active sites such as doping, defects, and edges. Benefiting from structural features of the one-dimensional (1D) carbon hollow nanoarchitecture, which affords plentiful active sites, continuous conducing pathways, and benign mass transfer channels, the resultant catalyst reveals an excellent trifunctional electrocatalytic activity for ORR, OER, and HER. Impressively, it exhibits one of the best metal-free bifunctional electrocatalytic activities in oxygen electrocatalysis as characterized by a low potential deviation (Delta E) of 0.73 V between the half-wave potential (E-1/2) for ORR and the potential reaching 10 mA cm(-2) (E-j=10) for OER. Significantly, further investigations demonstrate that the effect of mass transfer makes a great difference to electrocatalytic activity, mainly through enlarged specific surface area to affect intrinsic catalytic activity and the ionic resistance in pores. This work sheds light on the design, fabrication, and regulation of highly active metal-free electrocatalysts with abundant active sites and tuned pore structures for electrocatalysis and other applications.									66	9	0	0	2	0	68			2211-2855	2211-3282		WOS:000487931500047

Our Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations of the intermediate energetics for hydrogen evolution and oxygen evolution suggest that none of the proposed materials has the ideal combination of bandgap and surface chemical properties that should allow for total water splitting in a single material. This result suggests that co-catalysts are necessary to overcome the kinetic limitations of the both reactions, although some materials may catalyze one half-reaction, as has been observed in experiment.									48	2	0	0	3	0	49			1463-9076	1463-9084		WOS:000346906700039	25502921

The surface state of the electrodes was monitored in situ by recording voltammetric curves before and after each experiment. Stability was tested by cycling the electrodes between 0.4 and 1.4V (the). For all compositions the anodic-to-cathodic charge ratio, q(a)/q(c), was close to one. Variation of the negative potential limit did not reveal the occurrence of the cathodic dissolution phenomena previously observed with a similar RuO2-based system. Tafel slopes were independent of the CeO2 content, with a value around 30 mV. The reaction order with respect to H+ was zero at constant overpotential and ionic strength. Some inhibition of the oxygen evolution reaction is observed as Ti is replaced by Ce.

Herein, a one-pot hydrothermal synthesis of cobalt sulfide/nickel sulfide heterostructure supported by nickel foam (CoSx/Ni3S2@ NF) was performed. The Ni foam acted as the three-dimensional conducting substrate as well as the source of nickel for Ni3S2. The formation of CoSsx/Ni3S2@NF was confirmed by X-ray diffraction and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. The formation of CoSx/Ni3S2@NF facilitated easy charge transport and showed synergistic electrocatalytic effect toward HER, OER, and overall water splitting in alkaline medium. Remarkably, CoSx/Ni3S2@NF showed catalytic activity comparable with that of benchmarking electrocatalysts Pt/C and RuO2. For CoS,INi3S2@NF, overpotentials of 204 and 280 mV were required to achieve current densities of 10 and 20 mA cm(-2) for HER and OER, respectively, in 1.0 M KOH solution. A two-electrode system was formulated for overall water splitting reaction, which showed current densities of 10 and 50 mA cm(-2) at 1.572 and 1.684 V, respectively. The prepared catalyst exhibited excellent durability in HER and OER catalyzing conditions and also in overall water splitting operation. Therefore, CoSx/Ni3S2@NF could be a promising noble-metal-free electrocatalyst for overall water splitting application.									179	7	0	0	5	0	181			1944-8244			WOS:000442706600018	30044090

Under cathodic polarization, the oxygen reduction and the hydrogen evolution reactions were observed. It was found that the activity of the electrode toward the electron transfer increased with decreasing the electrode surface charge. The polarization curves recorded in serum displayed the same features as those observed in inorganic buffered solutions. However, organic molecules were likely adsorbed onto the titanium surface and the adsorption reactions were potential dependant. Additionally, it was noticed that the buffer capacity of serum could be overwhelmed by the progressive interface alkalinization during cathodic polarization. Furthermore, serum affected the corrosion current of the implant materials and the effect was pH-dependent. (C) 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

In particular, we introduce for the first time a novel La5Ni4O13-delta with a 4-layered perovskite structure (n = 4) for use as a highly active and durable bifunctional oxygen catalyst for OER/ORR. Concretely, La5Ni4O13-delta catalysts has demonstrated performance of 1.65 V at 10 mA.cm(-2) and 0.66 V at near half-wave potential (-3 mA.cm(-2)) for OER and ORR, respectively, this indicates excellent intrinsic OER/ORR kinetics. Furthermore, by controlling the fuel-to-oxidizer ratio (using extremely fuel-rich conditions) in the glycine-nitrate combustion technique, the 4-layered perovskite La5Ni4O13-delta catalysts are synthesized as a single Ruddlesden-Popper phase with various dopants to further boost its bifunctional oxygen electrode activity. Among OER/ORR catalysts, La5Ni3CoO13-delta catalysts exhibit exceptional electrocatalytic activity with low overpotential and Tafel slope (35/76 mV.dec(-1) for OER/ORR). Outstandingly, the La5Ni3CoO13-delta is able to achieve an extremely low overpotential of 370 mV at 10 mA.cm(-2) in 0.1 M KOH for OER, surpassing Ir/C catalysts and any metal oxide catalyst ever reported. The high catalytic performance of La5Ni3CoO13-delta can be attributed to its favorable electronic structure enriched with oxygen defects and electronic charge carriers (increased Ni oxidation state) as well as to the promoted lattice-oxygen oxidation mechanism pathway that comes from strong metal-oxygen covalency (high oxygen-ion diffusion rate).									10	0	0	0	0	0	10			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000618080300001

Essential components of this approach are: 1)combining an active (unstable Ru) component with a dopant (Zn)-activated passive (stable Ti) element, 2)blending these elements by co-electrodeposition in an acidic environment in which dissolution of the unstable component (excess Ru) promotes roughness, and 3)further increasing the roughness of the resultant electrode through chemical inhomogeneity by the incorporation of Ti and through structural inhomogeneity by incorporation of Zn in RuO2. The composition of the electrode with the maximal activity is Ru0.258Ti0.736Zn0.006Ox, and its activity is four times higher than that of RuO2. The electrochemical stability towards the OER follows the order RuTiZn>RuTi>RuZn>Ru. This design strategy provides a facile method to improve activity without compromising stability.									21	0	0	0	0	0	21			2196-0216			WOS:000364707700029

In this work, non-precious Nickel/Nickel Ferrite on carbon matrix (NNFOC) nanocomposite as bifunctional air-breathing electrode for rechargeable Li-air battery is proposed. The NNFOC composite on rotating ring disc electrode (RRDE) exhibited good oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activities. The synergistic contribution from Ni, nickel ferrite and porous carbon network that resulted more reaction sites, high conductivity and fast diffusion pathways, lead to enhanced ORR and OER activities. The CR-2032 coin-type and conventional split cell Li-air battery were fabricated using the NNFOC composite as air-breathing oxygen electrode and lithium metal as anode. The open-circuit voltage of the coin cell was invariant for more than 5 days, while the split cell exhibited high discharge capacity of 3820 mAh g(-1) at a current density of 50 mA g(-1). The charged split cell could power a commercial 2.8 V LED bulb for more than 5 h continuously.									8	1	0	0	0	0	9			2365-6549			WOS:000522352200006

Herein, via systematic firstprinciples calculations, we propose a general two-step strategy for developing highly active single-atom catalyst (SACs) supported on a prototypical substrate (g-C3N4) for bifunctional oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Our results show that the intrinsic activity can be properly evaluated by a robust screening rule, and, particularly, the descriptor can be readily calculated by a few handy and basic properties. According to the knowledge, we propose an effective approach (i.e., creating an N vacancy in the cavity of g-C3N4) that enables further activity improvement. Specifically, the predicted ORR/OER activity on Ag and Rh based SACs are comparable or even outperforms that of respective benchmark catalysts. This study not only provides several promising candidates for bifunctional ORR/OER, but also directs a new avenue for rational design of high-performance catalysts.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000651207500007

We report a high-performance electrocatalyst with an orthorhombic double perovskite structure (i.e., PrBaCo2O5+delta, delta =similar to 0.52), which shows superior activity and durability towards hydrogen evolution reaction in comparison to a cubic perovskite oxide (i.e., Pr-0.5 Ba0.5CoO3-delta) and a tetragonal one (i.e., PrBaCo2O5+delta, delta = similar to 0.76), despite the similar composition. The improvement of the electrocatalytic activity for hydrogen evolution reaction is mainly attributed to a high-degree structure distortion resulted from the high oxygen vacancy concentration, a large electrochemical active surface area, and a low charge transfer resistance. In addition, lattice oxygen species may provide an extra contribution to the enhancement of the hydrogen evolution reaction for Pr0.5Ba0.5CoO3-delta sintered at 1000 degrees C. Furthermore, a considerable correlation between O p-band centers and HER overpotentials is observed, and PBC-1100 with the highest O p-band center exhibits the best HER activity. These results indicate that the electrochemical performance of perovskite oxides could be effectively enhanced. Especially orthorhombic double perovskite oxides could be a new class of promising electrocatalysts.									30	1	0	0	1	0	30			0378-7753	1873-2755		WOS:000474327300021

In this work, we took advantage of the high intrinsic oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activity of La0.8Sr0.2MnO3-delta (LSMO) and the high intrinsic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity of Ba0.5Sr0.5Co0.8Fe0.2O3-delta (BSCF) to develop a novel bifunctional catalyst. We used pulsed laser deposition to fabricate well-defined surfaces composed of BSCF on thin-film LSMO grown on (001)-oriented Nb-doped SrTiO3. These surfaces exhibit bifunctionality for oxygen electrocatalysis with enhanced activities and stability for both the ORR and OER that rival the state-of-the-art single- and multicomponent catalysts in the literature.									165	7	0	0	8	0	169			0002-7863			WOS:000334572200013	24649849

Here, we report a simple and effective strategy for enhancing ORR and OER electrocatalytic activity in alkaline solution by introducing A-site cation deficiency in LaFeO3 perovskite; the enhancement effect is more pronounced for the OER than the ORR Among the A-site cation deficient perovskites studied, La0.95FeO3-delta (L0.95F) demonstrates the highest ORR and OER activity and, hence, the best bifunctionality. The dramatic enhancement is attributed to the creation of surface oxygen vacancies and a small amount of Fe4+ species. This work highlights the importance of tuning cation deficiency in perovskites as an effective strategy for enhancing ORR and OER activity for applications in various oxygen-based energy storage and conversion processes.									466	20	0	0	24	1	469			0897-4756	1520-5002		WOS:000372856600013

Herein, we report FeOOH-decorated NiMoO4 nanowires as OER pre-catalysts. In-situ Raman spectroscopy elucidates that modified NiMoO4 undergoes fast reconstruction, including significant Mo leaching and simultaneous formation of Ni(Fe)OOH intermediates, which are determined as the real active species toward the OER. Rapid and deep reconstruction results in amorphous nanowires with uniform Fe distribution and great size expansion. Impressively, the reconstructed pre-catalyst exhibits outstanding catalytic activity, ultra-low overpotential, and extraordinary long-term stability under high current densities. Our work provides a facile and effective surface engineering approach of pre-catalysts and highlights the evolution of self-reconstruction chemistry for accelerating the kinetics of the OER.

Nevertheless, how the solid catalyst successively catalyzes solid Li2O2 formation and decomposition, confronting passivation and loss of RuO2/Li2O2 contact, during discharging and charging remains a mystery. Here we report operando observations of RuO2 catalyzed oxygen reduction and evolution reactions of Li2O2 by utilizing a liquid cell scanning transmission electron microscope. Upon discharging, RuO2 obviously accelerates formation of soluble LiO2 intermediates and acts as preferential sites of Li2O2 precipitation. During charging, the catalytic activation of RuO2 takes place at electrolyte-RuO2-Li2O2 triple-phase interfaces. Importantly, RuO2 not only catalyzes the decomposition of directly contacted Li2O2, but also promotes oxidation of soluble LiO2 for rapid dissolution of isolated Li2O2 nanoparticles by a chemical comproportionation reaction. The observation unveils how RuO2 catalyzes the formation and decomposition of Li2O2 during discharging and charging and provides nanoscale insights into cathodic reactions of Li-O-2 batteries with solid catalysts.									34	2	0	0	1	0	35			2211-2855	2211-3282		WOS:000430057000045

Herein, we found the catalytic performance of FeNi nanoparticles, as proof of concept, for OER can be optimized via surface structure regulation by rational thermal oxidation and/or reduction approaches. Surface structure of FeNi pre-catalyst in a fully oxidized or metallic state is not active while proper synergism of these states is favorable as supported by some spectroscopic techniques and electrochemical measurements. The as-optimized FeNi catalyst requires only 230 mV overpotentials to offer 10 mA cm(-2), with faster catalytic kinetics, good stability and high active site efficiency. The efficient high valence state of Fe/Ni species synergism generated from the optimized FeNi pre-catalyst is revealed by the post and in-situ Raman spectrum analysis. The results could answer the varied performance of FeNi reported for OER and are also instructive for their performance optimization.									37	1	0	0	4	0	37			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000696992700001

Herein, cerium phosphate (CePO4) is demonstrated to be a novel cocatalyst that significantly enhances the OER performance of NiCo2O4 nanowire arrays on Ni foam. The high durability of OER performance over 1000 h and the low overpotential of 281 mV required to maintain a catalytic current density of 20 mA cm(-2) can be attributed to the synergetic effect between CePO4 and NiCo2O4. Explicitly, CePO4 as a cocatalyst efficiently tunes the surface states of NiCo2O4 and facilitates water adsorption and the conversion of intermediates, leading to a substantial OER performance enhancement. All results exhibit the potential of integrating CePO4 into NiCo2O4 to improve the water oxidation activity of NiCo2O4 and illustrate wide domains of application by combining rare earth elements into electrocatalysts.									19	0	0	0	0	0	19			2574-0962			WOS:000483434700050

Chemical storage, with energy stored in the bonds of chemical compounds such as hydrogen or carbon-containing molecules, is promising as these energy vectors can be reserved and transported easily. In this review, we aim to present the advantages and drawbacks of the main water electrolysis technologies available today: alkaline and PEM electrolysis. The choice of electrode materials for utilization in very basic and very acid conditions is discussed, with specific focus on anodes for the oxygen evolution reaction, considered as the most demanding and energy consuming reaction in an electrolyzer.

Herein, we prepared a porous and well dispersed spinel MnCo2O4 (MCO) catalyst through a facile solvothermal method followed by a calcination process. CH3COONH4 used in solvothermal process played an important role in control of the size and morphology of MCO. The as -prepared MCO submicrospheres feature a porous structure and a high specific surface area. Tested by the rotating ring disk electrode (RRDE) technique, the sample MCO-10 and MCO-5 shows best catalytic towards ORR and OER, respectively. In particular, MCO-10 exhibits a high diffusion limiting current density (5 mA cm(-2)) and a better stability comparable to commercial Pt/C (20 wt% Pt on carbon) catalyst.

In this regard, tuning activity at the molecular level is one of the most challenging problems. Here, we have strategically employed two isophthalate-based ligands to tune the molecular structure and chemical bonding of three Co-based MOFs at the atomic level. MOFs were well characterized by single-crystal X-ray diffraction, IR spectroscopy, and X-ray absorption spectroscopy. The assembly of Co in these three novel MOFs at the atomic level dictates the catalytic activity towards the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). The catalytic activity of these MOFs has been boosted further upon annealing thereby forming highly efficient noble-metal-free Co-single atom catalysts where the amount of cobalt is extremely low.									9	0	0	0	0	0	9			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000634845800001

Herein, the heterojunction electrocatalyst consisting of FeNi3/Ni2P nanoparticles encapsulated in N-doped carbon nanotubes (FeNi3/Ni2P@NCNTs) was obtained by a simple synthetic method. FeNi3/ Ni2P@NCNTs heterojunction effectively promoted the interface charge transfer between different components. Moreover, the prepared catalyst FeNi3/Ni2P@NCNTs exhibited extraordinary catalytic activity for OER in alkaline medium. The eta(10), Tafel slope, C-dl for OER were 298 mV, 81.82 mV dec(-1) and 14.35 mF cm(-2), respectively. Besides, no visible variation after stability test for 100 h continuously.

Herein, we demonstrate that the surface active electron density of Co3O4 can be effectively regulated by an argon-ion irradiation method. X-ray photoelectron and synchrotron x-ray absorption spectroscopy, UV photoelectron spectrometry, and DFT calculations show that the surface active electron density band center of Co3O4 has been upshifted, leading to a significantly enhanced absorption capability of the oxo group. The optimized Co3O4-based catalysts exhibit an excellent overpotential of 260 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) and Tafel slope of 54 mV dec(-1), superior to the capability of the benchmark RuO2, representing one of the best Co-based OER catalysts. This approach could guide the future rational design and discovery of ideal electrocatalysts.									83	7	0	0	4	0	86			1433-7851	1521-3773		WOS:000520526600001	32100367

However, their application as bifunctional catalysts for overall water splitting is still hindered by their limited activity. In this paper, via the surface defect engineering strategy, a bifunctional electrocatalyst based on oxygen vacancy enriched CoFe2O4 (r-CFO) nanosheets was successfully fabricated, exhibiting desired overall water splitting activity. DFT calculations demonstrated that benefitting from the incorporation of oxygen vacancies, the adsorption energy (Eads) of H2O and the Gibbs free energy change for hydrogen adsorption (Delta G(H*)) are both well optimized, leading to the fine modulation of active site activity. Meanwhile, along with oxygen vacancy doping, the density of states across the Fermi level increased as well, which would be conducive to fast electron transportation. As expected, the r-CFO catalyst afforded obviously lower overpotentials of 280 mV and 121 mV to achieve a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), respectively. Furthermore, r-CFO exhibited excellent overall water splitting activity with a voltage of 1.53 V to reach a current density of 10 mA cm(-2). This work highlights the vital role of surface defect engineering based on transition metal oxides toward advanced electrocatalysts.									44	2	0	0	1	0	45			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000490235800053

Here, we report a scalable approach to prepare welldefined Ni nanoparticles supported by nitrogen-doped carbon (Ni/NC), which possess superior catalytic activity and durability for OER, especially for the sample pyrolyzed at 600 degrees C. Moreover, the dynamic surface reconstruction of as-prepared catalysts during OER was detailedly investigated by ex-situ characterizations and operando X-ray absorption spectroscopy combined with the difference method that is a novel technique to probe the subtle structural changes. Our findings demonstrate that a surface oxidation to Ni(OH)2 on Ni nanoparticles occurs at the beginning of OER, and then a reversible phase transitions between Ni(OH)2 and NiOOH depends on the applied potential. Thus, this work develops a new method for preparing low-cost Ni-based electrocatalyst and sheds light on the direct observation of surface structure evolution during the OER.									7	0	0	0	1	0	7			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000728401100005

Modification of such structures was achieved by controlling the MnO2 incorporation during an anodic co-deposition process. The results indicate the anodic co-oxidation of Pb2+ and Mn2+ yielded a P-(PbO2-MnO2) deposit with a flat, compact and smooth surface. Meanwhile, the anodic composite deposition of Pb2+ and MnO2 particles resulted in the bicontinuous (P-PbO2)-MnO2 composite with a well-defined microporous morphology. Tafel and EIS were used to characterize their electrocatalytic performances for the oxygen evolution reaction in a typical anodic water-splitting process. The results indicate that such a novel bicontinuous (P-PbO2)-MnO2 composite anode exhibits significantly improved electrocatalytic activity as compared to the P-PbO2 and P-(PbO2-MnO2) anodes. The oxygen evolution kinetics and possible reaction mechanism are further described.									36	3	0	0	1	0	38			2046-2069			WOS:000338042500012

The absorption edge of the XAFS spectrum shifted to higher energy values during the photocatalytic reaction as the sacrificial reagent was consumed. This indicates that the MnOx cocatalyst was oxidized by the transfer of photogenerated holes, resulting in a positive potential shift of the cocatalyst throughout the oxygen evolution reaction.									7	1	0	0	0	0	7			0366-7022	1348-0715		WOS:000345059200015

Three comparable two-dimensional (2D) metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) were designed and synthesized to explore the underlying mechanism. Among the examined 2D MOFs,CoFe-MOFexhibited the best OER performance compared withCo-MOFandCoNi-MOF. The proposed model of bimetallic and monometallic electrocatalysts affecting their OER performance can help to explore precise structure-performance relationships for a rational catalyst design at the atomic/molecular levels and understand the related catalytic mechanisms as well.									25	2	0	0	0	0	26			2044-4753	2044-4761		WOS:000543417300005

Intuitively, alkaline environments lead to milder degradations than acidic ones, although carbon-supported Pt-group metal nanoparticles are particularly degraded even in dilute alkaline electrolytes. To date, PtNi catalyst durability has not been characterized for alkaline oxygen reduction and evolution reactions (ORR and OER). Herein, carbon-supported shape-controlled PtNi catalysts were compared in terms of activity and durability during alkaline ORR and OER. The PtNi catalysts are shape-controlled Pt-rich alloy, Ni-rich alloy, and Pt core/Ni shell (Pt@Ni) nanoparticles synthesized on Vulcan XC72R carbon. Their morphology and composition were evaluated by identical-location transmission electron microscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and X-ray diffraction pre- and post-accelerated stress tests. Compared to Pt/C and Ni/C benchmark catalysts, the core-shell and Ni-rich alloy catalysts gave high and stable OER activities. After the accelerated stress test, the catalysts show two features that are believed to play a major role in the durability: a Ni enrichment at the nanoparticles' surface and an improved attachment of the catalyst to the carbon support.									9	0	0	0	0	0	9			2574-0962			WOS:000576676900079

Herein, Na/Al codoped Li-excess Li-Ru-Ni-O layered electrodes are demonstrated with defects/dislocations as an efficient bifunctional electrocatalyst toward lithium-ion battery (LIB) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Toward LIB cathode, specific capacity of 173 mAh g(-1) (0.2C-rate), cyclability (>95.0%), high Columbic efficiency (99.2%), and energy efficiency (90.7%) are achieved. The codoped electrocatalyst has exhibited OER activity at a low onset potential (270 mV@10 mA cm(-2)), with a Tafel slope 69.3 mV dec(-1), and long-term stability over 36 h superior to the undoped and many other OER electrocatalysts including the benchmark IrO2. The concurrent doping resides in the crystal lattice (where Na shows the pillaring effect to improve facile Li diffusion), Al improves the stabilization of the layered structure, and defective structures provide abundant active sites to accelerate OER reactions.									9	1	0	0	0	0	9			1613-6810	1613-6829		WOS:000634638000001	33783095

In the synthesis process, a great quantity of uniform NiMnO3 nanosheets generated by a universal hydrothermal method acts as precursors and templates and the cheap, environmentally friendly and recyclable glucose functions as a green carbon source. Via subsequent hydrothermal reaction and thermal annealing, sandwiched nanocomposites with Ni-Mn nanoparticles embedded inside and carbon sheets encapsulating outside can be massively prepared. The novel sandwich-like CS@Ni-Mn possesses numerous advantages, such as an intrinsic porous feature, large specific surface area, and enhanced electronic conductivity. Moreover, as a promising NiMn-based oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalyst, the special sandwiched nanostructure demonstrates improved electrochemical properties in 1 M KOH, including a low overpotential of about 250 mV, a modest Tafel slope of 40 mV dec(-1), excellent stability over 2000 cycles, and durability for 40 h.									26	0	0	0	0	0	26			1944-8244			WOS:000375521000025	27101350

Herein, a simple method is used to synthesize a non-noble metal-based electrocatalyst for OER by synergistically coupling a catalytically active cobalt layered double hydroxide (Co-LDH) with a highly electrically conducting 2D transition metal carbide, Ti3C2Tx MXene. The synergy between these two bidimensional materials (Co-LDH and Ti3C2Tx), evidenced by coupling electron energy loss spectroscopy and density functional theory simulations, results in superior electrocatalytic properties and makes possible having an excellent and stable oxygen evolution electrocatalyst. Moreover, the oxidative-sensitive MXene structure is preserved during the synthesis of the composite and the formation of a well recovering Co-LDH phase avoids the irreversible oxidation of MXene at high potential values, which may affect its conductivity. With an overpotential of approximate to 330 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) the catalyst exhibits a higher catalytic activity toward OER than commercial IrO2 catalysts.									45	3	0	0	1	0	46			2196-7350			WOS:000491123100001

Herein, we report the utilization of a high entropy nanocatalyst alloy for the electrooxidation of hydrazine. The high entropy nanocatalyst comprising five elements (Ag, Au, Pt, Pd, Cu) shows profound activity toward this molecule at a low overvoltage. An intriguingly high-entropy nanocatalyst prepared by the casting-cum-cryomilling method is endowed with the unique catalytic activity for the HzOR. A detailed analysis of gaseous product points to the formation of nitrogen as well as oxygen as the oxidation product, a sign of accompanying the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Interestingly, a significant amount of oxygen is detected at 1.13 V (reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE)) in a neutral buffered medium, confirming that the OER is functional at a voltage near the thermodynamic voltage of 1.23 V (RHE). The quantitative contribution of each hydrazine and OER is ascertained, which explains a vital insight into this reaction. Density functional theory calculations showed that both HzOR and OER assist each other where the electron-donating effect of H2O to the surface can reduce the endothermicity of the HzOR. However, the electron acceptance of *NHNH2 helps in a favorable overlap of the HEA Fermi level and vacant states with the HOMO of H2O.									5	0	0	0	1	0	5			2155-5435			WOS:000758012900010

During the last decade, they emerged as potential routes to sustain the ever-growing needs of the future clean energy market. Unfortunately, the state-of-the-art OER and ORR electrocatalysts, which are based on noble metals, are noticeably limited by a generally high activity towards one type of reaction only, high costs and relatively low abundance. Therefore, the development of (bi)functional low-cost non-noble metal or metal-free electrocatalysts is expected to increase the practical energy density and drastically reduce the production costs. Owing to their pore properties and high surface areas, mesoporous materials show high activity towards electrochemical reactions. Among all synthesis methods available for the synthesis of non-noble mesoporous metal oxides, the hard-templating (or nanocasting) approach is one of the most attractive in terms of achieving variable morphology and porosity of the materials. In this review, we thus focus on the recent advances in the design, synthesis, characterization and efficiency of non-noble metal OER and ORR electrocatalysts obtained via the nanocasting route. Critical aspects of these materials and perspectives for future developments are also discussed.									9	0	0	0	0	0	9				2304-6740		WOS:000482965600012

In the present study, we synthesized NiCoMnO4 nanoparticles anchored on nitrogen-doped graphene nanosheets as highly efficient bifunctional electrocatalysts for the Oxygen Reduction Reaction (ORR) and for the Oxygen Evolution Reaction (OER). Proper anchoring of NiCoMnO4 nanoparticles on graphene layers was probed with various characterization techniques including X-ray diffraction, energy dispersive X-ray (EDX), Raman, and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy as well as transmission electron microscopy (TEM). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was also employed to shed light on the oxidation states of metallic atoms and types of doped nitrogen on graphene layers. According to the obtained results, the NiCoMnO4/N-rGO hybrid showed excellent electrocatalytic activity towards ORR (E-onset = 0.92V vs. RHE and high current density of 0.84 mA cm(-2)) and OER (E-onset = 1.5 V vs. RHE and high current density of 14 mA cm(-2)), much better than other evaluated catalysts. It has been shown that the NiCoMnO4/N-rGO catalyzes ORR mostly through 4e process, just as the commercial Pt based catalyst. Moreover, it outperforms the commercial catalyst with very little decay in ORR activity over long continuous operation and shows excellent catalytic selectivity and methanol tolerance.

The charge state of Co species and the electrocatalytic performance of the prepared catalysts are manipulated by controlling Co to Se mass ratio. Mechanistic studies show that a high Co charge state favors oxygen evolution reaction performance and a low Co charge state promotes hydrogen evolution reaction activity for as-prepared cobalt selenide electrocatalysts. The resultant materials can act as free-standing bifunctional electrocatalytic electrodes for oxygen evolution reaction and hydrogen evolution reaction in alkaline media. Moreover, a 10.3 mA cm(-2) current density at 1.8 V is achieved for overall seawater electrolysis through exploiting as-synthesized cobalt selenide electrodes as both anode and cathode, which is three times higher than that for novel-metal-based seawater electrolyzer at the same voltage (2.9 mA cm(-2)). Experimental results reveal that the cobalt selenide electrodes show significantly higher electrocatalytic performance than that of integrated Ni/Ir-C and Ni/Pt-C electrodes. Consequently, these novel bifunctional electrodes are promising candidates for realistic large-scale water electrolysis.									155	12	0	0	8	0	157			1614-6832	1614-6840		WOS:000447257000015

However, achieving good ORR/OER bifunctionality with single materials has proven challenging. Here we report a composite material as a bifunctional oxygen electrode for ORR and OER. The composite oxygen electrode consists of an ORR-active 20 wt% Pt/C and an OER-active perovskite La0.6Sr0.4CoO3-delta (LSCO). The study focuses on identifying the optimal LSCO: Pt/C ratio through electrochemical DC voltammetry techniques. The results show that the addition of Pt/C into the LSCO catalyst greatly enhances the ORR activity, due to Pt/C's superior ORR capabilities, while LSCO retains good OER performance, which is known to be poor for Pt/C. The optimal LSCO: Pt/C ratio among the seven compositions studied is found to be 60: 40 (wt%) and is tested for stability through using a square-wave potentiostatic method. Overall, this study demonstrates a synergetic effect between LSCO and Pt/C, with each one contributing towards one of the electrode reactions in a positive manner.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			2352-152X			WOS:000468900700049

NiO films were obtained by thermal treatment of Ni electrodeposited from electrolytic solutions containing glycine at different pH values. NiO films were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The grain size of electrocatalysts decrease from 160 to 70 nm and the oxygen vacancies content increases, as the pH of the solution was increased during the synthesis. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) and Chronoamperometry techniques were employed to evaluate the electrocatalytic activity of the films. NiO electrocatalysts obtained at pH values higher than 5 exhibit a better electrocatalytic performance than the obtained at pH values less than 4, such as an overpotential to reach 1 mAcm(-2) of 450 mV and 530 mV, respectively. NiO synthesized under alkaline conditions exhibit the best stability performance with a loss of current density of 7% after 2 h of water electrolysis, whereas NiO synthesized under acidic conditions loss 50% of current density. The improvement is associated to the presence of oxygen vacancies that promote the activity and stability of the electrocatalysts towards the OER. (c) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

The materials were studied in an alkaline environment, where it was discovered that the oxygen evolution (OER) and the oxygen reduction (ORR) activity of the catalysts can be severely influenced by changing the parameters of the peat carbonization procedure. High OER activity was achieved with a minimally treated catalyst which seemed to be because of a Co-rich FeCo alloy species. In both rotating disc electrode and anion exchange membrane fuel cell ex-periments, the catalyst based on ZnCl2-activated peat-derived carbon showed superior ORR performance with a peak power density of 51 mW cm (-2). It was found that the peak power densities of the catalysts correlated with several physical parameters. Above all, we demonstrate the possibility of fabricating advanced functional carbon materials for oxygen electrocatalysis from peat. (c) 2022 The Authors.

The unusual properties of high entropy oxides endow their potential application in clean-energy-related electrocatalysis. However, the possible fundamental relationship between configuration entropy and the underlying catalytic mechanism is still not well understood and established. Herein, a high entropy perovskite cobaltate consisting of five equimolar metals in the B-site (Mg, Mn, Fe, Co, and Ni) is employed as an electrocatalyst for oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The configuration entropy serves as an effective tool to promote the intrinsic activity of the Co reactive site and manipulate the OER mechanism. The high entropy cobaltate demonstrates a lower overpotential of 320 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2), outperforming other counterparts. The X-ray spectroscopies disclose the synergistic charge-exchange effect among different cations and the formation of a new oxygen hole state. Combinatorially computational and experimental results unveil the enigma that the high configuration entropy leads to the random occupation of cations, facilitates the surface reconstruction, and benefits the formation of stable surface oxygen vacancies. Owing to these merits, the O-2 formation is found to be kinetically favorable via the lattice oxygen mechanism.									9	0	0	0	0	0	8			1616-301X	1616-3028		WOS:000782293200001

Therefore, developing the oxygen electrocatalysts which can accelerate oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is a critical issue. Mn-based perovskite has drawn extensive interests though their ORR and OER catalytic activity still needs to be improved. In this work, a new family of Mn-based perovskite (La1-xYxMnO3, LYM) is developed which demonstrates an improved ORR and OER catalytic activity compared with the representative strontium-doped Mn-based perovskite (LSM). For La0.9Y0.1MnO3 (LYM-10), the onset potential and half-wave potential during ORR can reach 0.909 V and 0.750 V (vs. RHE), respectively, which are more positive than those of LSM reported in most of the recent reports. Furthermore, LYM-10 also shows a better OER catalytic activity than La0.7Sr0.3MnO3 (LSM-30). In addition to its good bifunctional property, LYM-10 also achieves the superior durability compared with Pt/C during ORR, and the current retention of LYM-10 is as high as 97.3% after 43000 s. Using LYM-10 as the cathode catalyst, the alunimum-air battery can reach the maximum power density of 266 mW/cm(2), and zinc-air battery can obtain low charge-discharge overpotential and the good cycling stability.

Using first-principles calculations, we demonstrated the recently-synthesized two-dimensional (2D) metal organic frameworks (MOFs) of transition metals (TM = Cr-Zn, Ru-Ag, Ir, and Pt) atoms and tetraaza[14]annulene (TAA) can deem as multi-functional photocatalysts. Fe-TAA and Rh-TAA MOFs show the bi-functional catalytic activity towards ORR/OER and HER/OER, respectively, while Ir-TAA MOF is a promising tri-functional catalyst for HER/OER/ORR. The catalytic activity of TM-TAA MOFs was revealed to be governed by the binding strength between the TM atom and reaction intermediates, which can be correlated to the d-band center of the TM atoms. Remarkably, the electronic band structures and the photocatalytic activity of Ir-TAA and Rh-TAA MOFs fulfil the requirements of overall water splitting under visible light irradiation. Our findings proposed a new family of 2D MOFs as efficient catalysts for the OER, ORR, and HER in clean energy technologies, offering a promising perspective in catalyst design.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000621407000040

Previous work focuses mainly on the effect of electronic structure modulation on the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) performance of 3d-transition-metal-based electrocatalyst. However, high-atomic-number W-based compound with complex electronic structure for versatile modulation is seldom explored because of its instability in OER-favorable alkaline solution. Here, codoping induced electronic structure modulation generates a beneficial effect of transforming the alkaline-labile WO2.72 (WO) in to efficient alkaline-solution-stable Co and Fe codoped WO2.72 (Co&Fe-WO) with porous urchin-like structure. The codoping lowers the chemical valence of W to ensure the durability of W-based catalyst, improves the electron-withdrawing capability of W and O to stabilize the Co and Fe in OER-favorable high valence state, and enriches the surface hydroxyls, which act as reactive sites. The Co&Fe-WO shows ultralow overpotential (226 mV, J = 10 mA cm(-2)), low Tafel slope (33.7 mV dec(-1)), and good conductivity. This catalyst is finally applied to a photovoltaic-water splitting system to stably produce hydrogen for 50 h at a high solar-to-hydrogen efficiency of 16.9%. This work highlights the impressive effect of electronic structure modulation on W-based catalyst, and may inspire the modification of potential but unstable catalyst for solar energy conversion.									39	3	0	0	0	0	39				2198-3844		WOS:000474834400001	31453064

The low-crystalline CoOOH nanosheets were assembled randomly by numerous short-range (1-5 nm) ordered grains with different orientations, inducing abundant grain boundaries (edge sites of CoOOH). Moreover, a certain number of structural defects (oxygen vacancies) were also engineered on the low-crystalline CoOOH nanosheets. Benefiting from these abundant edge sites of CoOOH and oxygen vacancies, LC-CoOOH NAs/CFC exhibit much improved OER activity compared to the high-crystallinity CoOOH NAs/CFC with a perfect structure. This research provides a new way to synthesize the defective materials with a short-range ordered structure and lays a valuable theoretical foundation for the structure and property of OER catalysts.									37	1	0	0	1	0	37			2155-5435			WOS:000656056200019

The photocatalytic water splitting mechanism on a BeN2 monolayer has here been investigated by using state-of-the-art density functional theory calculations. For all possible reaction intermediates, the calculated changes in Gibbs free energy showed that the oxygen evolution reaction will occur at, and above, the potential of 2.06 V (against the NHE) as all elementary steps are exergonic. In the case of the hydrogen evolution reaction, a potential of 0.52 V, or above, was required to make the reaction take place spontaneously. Interestingly, the calculated valence band edge and conduction band edge positions for a BeN2 monolayer are located at the potential of 2.60 V and 0.56 V, respectively. This indicates that the photo-generated holes in the valence band can oxidize water to oxygen, and the photo-generated electrons in the conduction band can spontaneously reduce water to hydrogen. Hence, the results from the present theoretical investigation show that the BeN2 monolayer is an efficient bifunctional water-splitting catalyst, without the need for any co-catalyst.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			2045-2322			WOS:000600132400015	33293563

Currently, precious-metal-based catalysts such as Pt, IrO2, and RuO2 are being used for water electrolysis limiting its wide range of applicability due to their high cost and rare-earth abundance. In this research, we have used nanowires of cobalt sulfide as an efficient electrocatalyst for overall water splitting. Directly grown nanowires of cobalt sulfide on nickel foam provided superior electrocatalytic activities favoring electron transfer. High surface area and porosity of the nanowires allowed easy escape of the generated oxygen and hydrogen. Cobalt sulfide nanowires required an overpotential of 299 and 217 mV to achieve a current density of 10 mA/cm(2) for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), respectively. Furthermore, nanowires of cobalt sulfide required a low cell voltage of 1.66 V to achieve a current density of 10 mA/cm(2) which is among the best-reported value. A facile preparation method, outstanding bi-functionality, and electrochemical stability of cobalt sulfide as both HER and OER electrocatalyst, suggest that cobalt sulfide could be a promising material for commercial applications in water electrolysis.									23	2	0	0	0	0	23			2199-692X			WOS:000452048600007

SiP2S6 monolayer holds a moderate band gap of 2.78 eV and suitable band edge positions for overall water splitting. Also, it harbors excellent optical absorption, even comparable to that of g-C3N4 monolayer. More remarkably, the photocatalytic hydrogen and oxygen evolution half reactions on the surface of SiP2S6 monolayer can occur spontaneously with only solar light irradiation, without needing sacrificial reagents or co-catalysts. This discovery not only reveals the great potential of SiP2S6 monolayer in photocatalytic applications but also broadens the scientific impact of two-dimensional photocatalysts.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			0022-3727	1361-6463		WOS:000498651700001

These fct-FePt NPs show strong ferromagnetism with room temperature coercivity reaching 33 kOe. They serve as a robust electrocatalyst for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in 0.1 M HClO4 and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in 0.5 M H2SO4 with much enhanced activity (the most active fct-structured alloy NP catalyst ever reported) and stability (no obvious Fe loss and NP degradation after 20 000 cycles between 0.6 and 1.0 V (vs RHE)). Our work demonstrates a reliable approach to FePt NPs with much improved fct-ordering and catalytic efficiency for ORR and HER.									302	27	0	0	11	0	308			1530-6984	1530-6992		WOS:000352750200039	25723811

The experimental results suggest that the order of sensitivity to heat is as follows: evolution of oxygen > reactions of Photosystem II almost-equal-to synthesis of ATP > reaction involving cytochrome b6/f > reactions of Photosystem I. Glycinebetaine was effective in protecting the evolution of oxygen, but none of the other reactions against heat inactivation. The heat stability of the electron-transport and phosphorylation reactions was also examined in cells that had a mutation in fatty-acid desaturation. The results suggest that the unsaturation of fatty acids of the membrane lipids had no effect on the heat stability of the elect-ron-transport and phosphorylation reactions examined.									85	6	0	0	74	0	92			0006-3002			WOS:A1993KW77500001

The size of the obtained Ni12P5 nanocapsules is about 20 nm, and the wall thickness is about 3 nm. The XPS spectra of Ni12P5 samples were measured to identify the surface chemical composition and valence states. Oxygen evolution reaction results show that the onset overpotential of Ni12P5 is 290 mV and clearly demonstrates the Tafel slope of 49.8 mV dec(-1). Meanwhile, the Ni12P5 nanocapsules show excellent electrochemical properties with specific capacitance of 949 F g(-1) at 1 A g(-1) and 81% of the initial value after cycles. Excellent electrochemical performances demonstrate that the nickel phosphide from a facile synthesis strategy could be a candidate for high performance energy storage and conversion.

Hence, a thermodynamic analysis of oxygen binding with hemoglobins from different species reveals a series of adaptive mechanisms which are based on the thermodynamic connection between the binding of heterotropic effecters and the reaction with oxygen.The examples reported, from fishes to human fetus, illustrate how evolution can alter the structural basis of the heterotropic interactions to optimize the oxygenation-deoxygenation cycle in dependence of the physiological needs of the particular organisms. Moreover they show that a thermodynamic analysis of the reaction with oxygen overcomes the meaning of a detailed structural and functional characterization going deeper into the physiology of the specific organism.									24	0	0	0	23	0	24			0014-2956			WOS:A1994NY14900001	7519981
