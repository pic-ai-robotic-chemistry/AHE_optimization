The IrO2 NP surface coverage can be fine-tuned by controlling the number of bilayers. The IrO2 NP films were amorphous, with the NPs therein being well-dispersed and retaining their as-synthesized shape and sizes. UV/vis spectroscopic and spectro-electrochemical studies confirmed that the total surface coverage and electrochemically addressable surface coverage of IrO2 NPs increased linearly with the number of bilayers up to 10 bilayers. The voltammetry of the modified electrode was that of hydrous iridium oxide films (HIROFs) with an observed super-Nernstian pH response of the Ir(III)/Ir(IV) and Ir(IV)-Ir(IV)/Ir(IV)-Ir(V) redox transitions and Nernstian shift of the oxygen evolution onset potential. The overpotential of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) was essentially pH independent, varying only from 0.22 V to 0.28 V (at a current density of 0.1 mA cm(-2)), moving from acidic to alkaline conditions. Bulk electrolysis experiments revealed that the IrO2/PDDA films were stable and adherent under acidic and neutral conditions but degraded in alkaline solutions. Oxygen was evolved with Faradaic efficiencies approaching 100% under acidic (pH 1) and neutral (pH 7) conditions, and 88% in alkaline solutions (pH 13). This layer-by-layer approach forms the basis of future large-scale OER electrode development using ink-jet printing technology.									13	1	1	0	0	0	13			1463-9076	1463-9084		WOS:000373000100056	26977761

The catalyst film is one of the most active nonprecious metal materials for electrochemical hydrogen evolution, drawing 10 mA/cm(2) at similar to 200 mV overpotential. To identify the active phase of the material, we perform X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy after testing under a variety of conditions. As deposited, the catalyst resembles amorphous MoS3, but domains resembling MoS2 in composition and chemical state are created under reaction conditions and may contribute to this material's high electrochemical activity. The activity scales with electrochemically active surface area, suggesting that the rough, nanostructured catalyst morphology also contributes substantially to the film's high activity. Electrochemical stability tests indicate that the catalyst remains highly active throughout prolonged operation. The overpotential required to attain a current density of 10 mA/cm(2) increases by only 57 mV after 10 000 reductive potential cycles. Our enhanced understanding of this highly active amorphous molybdenum sulfide hydrogen evolution catalyst may facilitate the development of economical electrochemical hydrogen production systems.									863	33	1	0	47	1	873			2155-5435			WOS:000308577300011

Because of the unique properties of the single-atom-site, using the single atoms as catalysts to synthesize SACs is promising. In this work, we have successfully achieved Co-1 SAC using Pt-1 atoms as catalysts. More importantly, this synthesis strategy can be extended to achieve Fe and Ni SACs as well. X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) results demonstrate that the achieved Fe, Co, and Ni SACs are in a M-1-pyrrolic N-4 (M= Fe, Co, and Ni) structure. Density functional theory (DFT) studies show that the Co(Cp)(2) dissociation is enhanced by Pt-1 atoms, thus leading to the formation of Co-1 atoms instead of nanoparticles. These SACs are also evaluated under hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER), and the nature of active sites under HER are unveiled by the operando XAS studies. These new findings extend the application fields of SACs to catalytic fabrication methodology, which is promising for the rational design of advanced SACs.Synthesizing single-atom catalysts through a general method presents a great challenge. Here the authors report that Fe, Co and Ni single-atom catalysts can be obtained using pre-located isolated Pt atoms as the catalyst and identify the role of Pt single atoms in the synthesis process.									17	0	0	0	1	0	16				2041-1723		WOS:000723149100007	34815417

The raw solid residue (RS) contains moisture (21.5%) and residual oil (6.4%). Therefore, from RS, raw samples without water (RSWW) and without oil (RSWO) were produced. Thermal analyses of samples were performed at different heating rates over a temperature range of 150-1050 degrees C. Pyrolysis behavior of the sample was studied in an argon atmosphere, whereas the combustion and gasification studies were conducted in oxygen and steam atmospheres, respectively. The effects of heating rate on the reaction rate and gas evolution were analyzed. Thermal degradation of RS showed that nearly 90% of the conversion occurred at below 700 degrees C. Gases produced in the three processes mainly consisted of hydrogen, hydrocarbons and carbon oxides. Alcohols and sulfur compounds were also detected in the temperature range of 300 to 500 degrees C for pyrolysis. Activation energies were determined from non-isothermal multi-heating rate thermogravimetric measurements. The variation in gas evolution was observed between the samples during gasification.									5	0	0	0	1	0	5			1759-7269	1759-7277		WOS:000693803000013

Carbon-based Photocathode Materials for Solar Hydrogen Production [arXiv]								arXiv								94 pp.	94 pp.						21 March 2019	2019	Hydrogen is considered a promising environmentally friendly energy carrier for replacing traditional fossil fuels. In this context, photoelectrochemical (PEC) cells effectively convert solar energy directly to H2 fuel by water photoelectrolysis, thereby monolithically combining the functions of both light harvesting and electrolysis. In such devices, photocathodes and photoanodes carry out hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER), respectively. Here, we focus on photocathodes for HER, traditionally based on metal oxides, III-V group and II-VI group semiconductors, Si and copper-based chalcogenides as photoactive material. Recently, carbon-based materials have emerged as reliable alternatives to the aforementioned materials. Here, we provide a perspective on carbon-based photocathodes, critically analysing recent research progresses and outlining the major guidelines for the development of efficient and stable photocathode architectures. In particular, we discuss the functional role of charge-selective and protective layers, which enhance both the efficiency and the durability of the photocathodes. We afford an in-depth evaluation of the state-of-the-art fabrication of photocathodes through scalable, high-throughput, cost-effective methods. The most critical issues regarding the recently developed light-trapping nanostructured architectures are also addressed. Finally, we analyse the key challenges on future research directions in terms of the potential performance and manufacturability of photocathodes.

Herein, we develop a strategy of micro-spherical cobalt-doped Fe5(PO4)4(OH)3 center dot H2O (Co-FPOH), synthesized by a novel water-oil two-phase hydrothermal method, which was used as ORR/OER bifunctional electrocatalyst for ZABs. The change of local electronic distribution is identified by doping of Co into Fe5(PO4)4(OH)3 center dot H2O (FPOH), effectively improving the electrocatalytic performance of the resulted Co-FPOH. The OER overpotential of Co-FPOH (290 mV) far outperforms state-of-the-art RuO2 (350 mV); the ORR catalytic reaction of Co-FPOH is near 4e-, almost reaching the theoretical value of Pt/C (n = 4.00). The ZAB assembled with Co-FPOH as an air electrode exhibits an ultralong cycling lifetime of 450 h at 5 mA cm-2, a super high peak power density of 167.8 Wh cm- 2, a high open circuit voltage of about 1.42 V and a large discharge specific capacity of 817 mAh gZn- 1 at 10 mA cm-2. The proposed Co-FPOH is expected to outperform precious metal electrocatalysts as a potential bifunctional electrocatalyst for advanced ZABs. Also, this work offers a novel strategy to synthesize excellent bifunctional electrocatalysts for this kind of energy-related electrocatalytic reactions.									15	0	0	0	2	0	15			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000703600800002

Hybrid DFT (UB3LYP and UBHandHLYP) Calculations								INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF QUANTUM CHEMISTRY				112	1	SI		321	343		10.1002/qua.23261				JAN 2012	2012	Very recently Umena et al. have determined the X-ray diffraction (XRD) structure of the CaMn4O5 cluster in the oxygen evolution complex (OEC) of photosystem II (PSII) refined to 1.9 angstrom resolution. We have performed theoretical attempts to elucidate possible electronic and spin states of their new XRD structure of the CaMn4O5 cluster. For the purpose, hybrid density functional theory (UB3LYP and UBHandHLYP) calculations have been performed for the mixed-valence (MV) CaMn(III)(4-omega) (IV)(omega)O-5(H2O)(4) (1) and CaMn(III)(4-omega)(IV)(omega)O-4(OH)(H2O)(4) (2) clusters as active catalytic site for water splitting reaction in OEC of PSII. Full geometry optimizations of 1a (omega = 2) and 2a (omega = 2) have been performed to elucidate scope and limitation of the cluster models. Both charge and spin fluctuated structures (48 UB3LYP solutions) have been considered for the MV 1a (omega = 2). Total energies obtained by these calculations have elucidated quasi-degenerated electronic and spin states that are characterized by charge and spin density populations. The energy levels revealed by hybrid DFT are analyzed on the basis of the Heisenberg spin Hamiltonian model, providing the effective exchange integrals between manganese ions at a uniform or MV structure. The spin projections for hybrid DFT solutions are performed using the effective exchange integrals. The charge fluctuation model is introduced to analyze relative stabilities among MV structures of 1a and 2a. These computational results for 1a and 2a have explored several characteristic electronic properties of the species that are used for theoretical elucidation of possible mechanisms of water splitting reaction. Orbital and spin correlation diagrams are derived for the O-O bond formation and oxygen evolution in the reaction. Implications of the computational results are also discussed in relation to available experiments and theoretical results by other groups. (C) 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Simulation results have indicated that the region of high electric field intensity moves in the direction of the plane electrode with the formation and propagation of an ionization wave. The region of low electric field intensity exists between the needle electrode and the head of the ionization wave, and its area increases continuously. The obvious voltage drop and local electric field enhancement occur between the head of the ionization wave and the plane electrode. Electron attachment reactions e + O-2 -> O + O- and e + 2O(2) -> O-2(-) + O-2 produce negative ions O- and O-2(-).

Electrolyte pH and electrode potential are key reactor operating conditions used to tune water-splitting kinetics whose influence remains incompletely understood. Here, we develop a microkinetic model, based on the Marcus theory of electron transfer, to predict the anodic oxygen-evolution-reaction (OER) current density (water-splitting rate) as a function of solution pH and electrode potential. Our model offers startling new insights into OER kinetics on Fe-doped b-nickel oxyhydroxide (beta-NiOOH), a promising, inexpensive candidate for electrocatalyzing the OER, under alkaline solution conditions. Only four fitting parameters with clearly defined physical meaning - reorganization free energies (l) for H+- and OH--based reactions and work terms (w) for transporting H+/OH- ions and water from the bulk solution to the electrocatalyst surface - are required to reproduce experimental polarization curves (i.e., current-density vs. potential plots) at multiple alkaline pHs. The inclusion of work terms renders multiple steps rate-determining for the OER. The predicted lambda H+ = 0.744 eV is much smaller than lOH = 2.474 eV, and wions = 0.607 eV is much larger than wwater = 0.065 eV, suggesting that the OER occurs primarily but not exclusively via water oxidation, rather than hydroxide oxidation, even under alkaline conditions. We show unequivocally that hydroxide oxidation also must occur as a minor channel, as accurate reproduction of polarization curves is impossible without it. We conclusively demonstrate the need to use the reversible, rather than the standard, hydrogen electrode as a reference in microkinetic models. Moreover, we deduce that the electrocatalyst surface is positively charged, contrary to inferences made in previous reports. Finally, we predict the following properties for the OER under high overpotential (\0.3 V) conditions on Fe-doped b- NiOOH: a Tafel slope of B76 mV per decade, an effective charge transfer coefficient of 0.77, and an exchange current density of 3.5 mA cm2 rivaling that of RuO2, one of the best noble-metalcontaining water-splitting electrocatalysts. Our work substantially deepens the mechanistic understanding of water-splitting kinetics on inexpensive iron/nickel-oxyhydroxide-based electrocatalysts, which may help optimize operating conditions for their widespread deployment.									25	0	0	0	0	0	25			1754-5692	1754-5706		WOS:000599751100025

Among the catalyst candidates, metal sulfides have been extensively explored as an emerging electrocatalyst material for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in water splitting reaction, because of their abundant active centers, good electrical conductivity, and high intrinsic activity. By optimizing the structure and chemical states, some advanced catalysts have been reported recently, which was instructive and inspiring for novel catalyst development. Herein, the recent advances in electrocatalytic performance and optimization strategies of transition-metal sulfide for OER are reviewed systematically and comprehensively. The fundamental catalytic mechanism and key parameters of OER are first presented and then followed by the physicochemical properties of metal sulfides, which could be helpful in understanding the correlation between the structure and catalytic performance. Importantly, the intrinsic activity of metal sulfides boosted by the general strategies, in terms of the defect/vacancy effect, lattice mismatch, phase engineering, heterostructure, and the doping effect, is mainly discussed in this work. The challenges and opportunities related to the further development of metal sulfide materials with high activity and long-term durability are finally proposed. It can be concluded that these regulatory strategies could largely improve the electrocatalytic performance by increasing the active site exposure and reducing the energy barrier of catalytic reactions. In addition, the problems and future challenges in improving the catalytic performance of metal sulfide materials are presented, which provides beneficial enlightenment and guidance for the development of efficient and low-cost electrocatalysts in the future. Hopefully, this effort would be helpful to the design and preparation of metal sulfides catalyst for OER.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			0887-0624	1520-5029		WOS:000818890300001

Herein, tremella-like Ni3S2@RuO2 and Ni3S2@NiFeOOH heterostructures catalysts are constructed on Ni foams (NF) by coupling RuO2 and NiFeOOH on Ni3S2 nanoflake arrays. The resulting Ni3S2@RuO2/NF electrode exhibits top-level hydrogen evolution reaction electrocatalysis with an extremely low overpotential of 12 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) and a Tafel slope of 30.7 mV dec(-1), as well as the as-obtained Ni3S2@NiFeOOH/NF electrode with tunable binding energy for OH* intermediates shows remarkable oxygen evolution reaction electrocatalysis with an overpotential of 227 mV at 10 mA cm(-2). The electrolyzer employing Ni3S2@RuO2/NF electrode for cathodic H-2 production and Ni3S2@NiFeOOH/NF for anodic O-2 production merely needs a low voltage of 1.47 V to drive 10 mA cm(-2) with excellent durability. The combined theoretical calculation and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy investigation reveal that heterogeneous configuration can induce electron transfer from Ni3S2 to RuO2 through Ni-Ru/S-Ru bonds, and thus tailor the d-band center and optimize the activated H2O/H* Gibbs free energies for enhanced hydrogen evolution reaction on Ni3S2@RuO2. This study may shed new light on the construction of heterostructures as highest-performing electrocatalysts and offer unique insight into the theory mechanism.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2366-9608			WOS:000829995200001	35869613

The reason lies in that the elemental phosphorous precursor favors to form c-BP, which is the thermodynamically stable phase. Herein, we report a facile ethylenediamine intercalation-and- deintercalation strategy to realize gram-scale preparation of a-BP. The atomic disordering in a-BP can be handily tuned by controlling the reaction time. Interestingly, the a-BP demonstrates atomic disordering-dependent oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity. The a-BP with higher atomic disordering delivers higher OER performance. Such enhanced OER activity is ascribed to more low-coordination sites and unpaired electrons which usually served as active sites, as verified by electrochemically active surface area measurement results and electron spin resonance. Density functional theory calculation further reveals the enhancement for OER activity is mainly attributed to boosting conversion from O* to OOH*. Our results not only create a controllable wet-chemical approach to scalable production of a-BP but provide insights into structure-property relationship and its underlying mechanisms.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2053-1583			WOS:000770434600001

The cyclic voltammetry experiments indicated that the diffusion coefficient of Ce(III) ions was 0.5 x 10(-6) cm(2) s(-1) and that the electrochemical kinetics for the oxidation of Ce(III) and the reduction of Ce(IV) was slow. The reversibility of the redox reaction depended on the electrolyte composition and improved at higher electrolyte temperatures. At higher methanesulfonic acid concentrations, the degree of oxygen evolution decreased by up to 50% when the acid concentration increased from 2 to 5 mol dm(-3). The oxidation of Ce(III) and reduction of Ce(IV) were also investigated during a constant current batch electrolysis in a parallel plate zinc-cerium flow cell with a 3-dimensional platinised titanium mesh electrode. The current efficiencies over 4.5 h of the process Ce(III) to Ce(IV) and 3.3 h electrolysis of the reverse reaction Ce(IV) to Ce(III) were 94.0 and 97.6%, respectively. With a 2-dimensional, planar platinised titanium electrode (9 cm(2) area), the redox reaction of the Ce(III)/Ce(IV) system was under mass-transport control, while the reaction on the 3-dimensional mesh electrode was initially under charge-transfer control but became mass-transport controlled after 2.5-3 h of electrolysis. The effect of the side reactions (hydrogen and oxygen evolution) on the current efficiencies and the conversion of Ce(III) and Ce(IV) are discussed. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

To evaluate the effect of particle size on Li-air cells, deposition times are 3, 10, 30, and 300 s. When cycled at a current density of 0.032 mA cm(-2), the Ag-deposited electrode for 300 s shows very low polarization corresponding to the oxygen evolution reaction potential at 3.6 V. X-ray diffraction studies confirm that the main discharge product is Li2O2, and the results of scanning electron microscopy and transmission electron microscopy of the discharged electrodes show lithium peroxides at different positions due to the limitation of active sites on silver particles.									19	3	0	0	1	0	19			1932-7447			WOS:000357964900025		
J	Beerkens, Ruud								Sulphur chemistry and sulphate fining and foaming of glass melts								GLASS TECHNOLOGY-EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF GLASS SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY PART A				48	1			41	52						FEB 2007	2007	Sulphate partly reacts during batch melting, dependent on the presence of reducing agents in the glass forming batch. These reactions cause early sulphur losses from the batch or primary melts, thus it reduces the sulphate content available for fining of the fresh melt. The fining mechanism of sulphate containing glass melts is described and a simulation model is derived to calculate gas evolution from thermodynamic properties of gases and fining agents in glass melts at equilibrium conditions. Modelling results have been validated by experimental data, comparing modelled gas evolution with experimentally observed bubble size changes during fining. The model and experiments are consistent for the determined fining gas evolution, and sulphate retention after fining. The influences of sulphate content and water infiltration in the glass melt on fining temperatures and gas evolution have been modelled for float glass type melts. The fining gas evolution depends significantly on the sulphur content of the freshly prepared melt just after batch fusion is completed. Also, the water content is decisive for the fining onset temperature and fining gas formation. An increase of the water content from 300 mg/kg float glass (typical for air fired furnaces) up to more than 450 mg/kg, typical for oxygen-fired furnaces, can lead to an increased gas release of a factor 1.5 to even 3 at fining temperatures. This may even lead to increased float glass melt foaming at surface temperatures above 1450 degrees C.					8th Conference of the European-Society-of-Glass-Science-and-Technology8th Conference of the European-Society-of-Glass-Science-and-Technology	SEP 10-14, 2006SEP 10-14, 2006	European Soc Glass Sci & TechnolEuropean Soc Glass Sci & Technol	Sunderland, ENGLANDSunderland, ENGLAND	16	0	0	0	0	0	16			0017-1050			WOS:000246295600006

Herein, we constructed the hybrid interface structure of NiSe2 and Ni nanoparticles and embedded them into an N,S-codoped carbon nanosheet framework (NiSe2/Ni-NSC). The partial selenization treatment endows the catalyst with an abundant interface, resulting in optimal electronic structure and hydrogen adsorption energy due to the strong interaction between Ni metal and metallic NiSe2. The ultrafine nanoparticle size allows the active edge sites to be fully exposed and their utilization efficiency to be improved. Benefiting from the structure characteristics, interface engineering, and high electroconductivity, the NiSe2/Ni-NSC exhibits superior and stable hydrogen evolution performances in pH-universal media, especially in acidic solution with an overpotential as low as 53 mV to achieve 10 mA cm(-2) current density, compared favorably with most Pt-free catalysts. Our work may pave a novel pathway to design heterostructure catalysts with high performance toward hydrogen evolution in the all-pH range.									21	2	0	0	0	0	21			2168-0485			WOS:000459367400053

Tremendous efforts have been made to improve ORR activity by designing bimetallic nanocatalysts, which have been limited to only alloys of platinum and transition metals (TMs). The Pt-TM alloys suffer from critical durability in acid-media fuel cells. Here a new class of mesostructured Pt-Al catalysts is reported, consisting of atomic-layer-thick Pt skin and Pt3Al or Pt5Al intermetallic compound skeletons for the enhanced ORR performance. As a result of strong Pt-Al bonds that inhibit the evolution of Pt skin and produce ligand and compressive strain effects, the Pt3Al and Pt5Al mesoporous catalysts are exceptionally durable and approximate to 6.3- and approximate to 5.0-fold more active than the state-of-the-art Pt/C catalyst at 0.90 V, respectively. The high performance makes them promising candidates as cathode nanocatalysts in next-generation fuel cells.									116	15	1	0	1	1	117			1616-301X	1616-3028		WOS:000347790600008

Additionally, doping LaNbON2 with cations of lower valence than that of the parent cation was performed to inhibit reduction of Nb5+. Various characterization methods indicated that crystallinity, particle morphology, and absorption edge of the product, that is, the factors possibly affecting photocatalytic activity, were not significantly changed by the doping of a lower-valence cation. Nevertheless, the doped LaNbON2 synthesized using the ammonothermal method evolved hydrogen, suggesting that this type of doping decreases the formation of reduced niobium species and consequently enhances the photocatalytic activity of LaNbON2. In case of doped LaNbON2 synthesized using conventional method, no hydrogen evolution was observed. This difference is probably due to the higher crystallinity of ammonothermally synthesized LaNbON2. Therefore, we successfully produced LaNbON2 with improved potential for photocatalytic activity for hydrogen evolution under visible light irradiation using ammonothermal synthesis and lower-valence cation doping.									17	1	0	0	0	0	17			1687-8434	1687-8442		WOS:000347334300001

However, the additional utilization of a reductant and/or the operation at the elevating temperature causes the over-growth and agglomer-ation of Pt clusters, thus losing the high catalytic performance. Herein, we report that V dopant not only favors self-reducing Pt clusters on NiFe layered double hydroxide (LDH) (Pt/NiFeV) at room temperature, but also regulates interfacial charge redistribution to enhance the water-splitting performance. Experimental and theoretical studies reveal that V dopant into NiFe LDH triggers more electrons to trans-fer to adjacent Fe atoms, thus leading to a higher reducing ability compared to that without V-doping. When used as water-splitting electrocatalyst, V doping promotes electron loss of Pt clusters in Pt/ NiFeV, optimizing the free energy of hydrogen adsorption and proton recombination kinetics at the cath-ode. Meanwhile, it also moves the d-band center of Ni away from the Fermi level to optimize the adsorp-tion of *OH intermediates and facilitate the desorption of oxygen molecules at the anode. Thereby, Pt/ NiFeV exhibits much higher bifunctional performance than V-free Pt/NiFe LDH toward both the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER). This work can spark inspiration of design-ing other bifunctional electrocatalysts for energy conversion and storage.

The Ni incorporation to Co to form the NiCo2O4 spinel decreased the crystallite size from 32.4 (Co3O4) to 15.3 nm (for NiCo2O4). The NiCo2O4 spinel displayed a rosette-like hierarchical shape, the Co3O4 presented a semispherical shape. Additionally, NiCo2O4 material presented 1.7-fold higher BET surface area than Co3O4. These physicochemical changes had a direct impact on the electrocatalytic activity for ORR/OER in alkaline media. The NiCo2O4 displayed an onset potential of 0.91 V vs. RHE during the ORR, which is 100 mV more positive to that obtained by the Co3O4 (0.81 V), and 110 mV lower to that displayed by Pt/C as reference material (1.02 V). Additionally, the NiCo2O4 material showed superior activity for OER in contrast to Co3O4 and Pt/C displaying a potential difference of 155 mV@10 mA cm(-2). Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) revealed that the improved activity of NiCo2O4 was not only related to surface area differences, but also to the improvement of the electrical properties because NiCo2O4 displayed a lower charge transfer resistance than the Co3O4 material (785.1 vs. 921.5 Omega cm(2)).									48	1	0	0	3	0	48			1572-6657	1873-2569		WOS:000482532200033

Compared with other materials, NiFe PBA-S/NF has better catalytic performance. We believe that the enhanced catalytic activity is due to the use of Prussian blue derivatives (PBAs), NiFe PBA has excellent electron transport capacity. Larger specific surface area provides a large number of active sites. Sulfur doping enhances the stability of the material. The combination of the two comprehensively improves the catalytic activity and stability of the catalyst.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1878-5190	1878-5204		WOS:000867552800002

Two types of IrO2-coated electrodes were used: anodically grown oxides on an It substrate and commercially available IrO2 nanoparticles, dispersed in a Nafion (R) polymer electrolyte layer on a glassy carbon substrate. EIS data indicate that both formulations behave as porous electrodes and their response can be described by variants of the classic transmission line model both at potentials outside and within the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) potential range; however, in the latter case, useful parameters could also be obtained by the use of common Randles models. An alternative approach to obtain capacitance values (free from the assumptions and geometric formulations of a model) has been based on plots of -1/(omega Z(Im)) vs. Z(re) that acquire or approach a limiting total capacitance value C-t at low or intermediate frequencies; the latter scales well with the charge associated with IrO2 surface electrochemistry and with oxide layer thickness or oxide particle loading. C-t can be taken as a measure of the catalyst electroactive surface area and the product RctCt (where R-ct is the OER charge transfer/polarization resistance) as the appropriate parameter to characterise the catalyst intrinsic catalytic activity. C-t can also be used to correct direct current vs. electrode potential OER data for electroactive surface area effects. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Results indicate that, above the oxygen evolution potential of BDD filmelectrode (2.4 V in 0.5 mol center dot L-1 H2SO4 solution), the generation rate of center dot OH increases as the applied potential or current density increases. However, there was no center dot OH ESR response when the applied potential was below 2.4 V center dot Compared to H center dot terminated surface, the O center dot terminated surface has a higher center dot OH generation efficiency because it is hydrophilic and this favors the water splitting reaction. The degradation processes for organic pollutants are always operated under high potential or current density, which allow the BDD film electrode surface to maintain its O center dot terminated condition. These conditions favor the center dot OH generation reaction and the reaction takes place with high activity. The pH value of the solution also influenced the center dot OH generation reaction. BDD filmelectrode has a stronger center dot OH generation ability in an acidic medium than in a neutral or alkaline medium. We also found that O-3(-) OH can be produced on the surface of BDD film electrode.This article provides new insights into the mechanism of OH generation on the surface of BDD film electrode and evidence of a highly efficient electrochemical oxidation process during the treatment of organic pollutants.									16	7	0	0	3	0	19			1000-6818			WOS:000278106600006

The process and kinetic behavior of thermal decomposition of ultrafine silver peroxide powders were studied by means of thermogravimetry and linear temperature theory. The results show that the prepared silver peroxide belongs to monoclinic system. The particle size is distributed in the range of 45 similar to 551 nm with a flake morphology and the most probable distribution is around 200 nm. The decomposition of silver peroxide is in two steps. First decomposition begins at 158 degrees C and silver oxide is formed by oxygen evolution. Further decomposition into silver begins at 413 degrees C. The decomposition reaction obeys random nucleation and subsequent growth mechanism (A2) with an apparent activation energy of 90.26 kJ.mol(-1) and a reaction frequency factor of 1.64x10(8) s(-1).									2	4	0	0	0	0	4			1001-4861			WOS:000282806700010		
J	Hona, Ram Krishna; Ramezanipour, Farshid				HONA, RAM/S-1829-2019				Effect of the Oxygen Vacancies and Structural Order on the Oxygen Evolution Activity: A Case Study of SrMnO3-delta Featuring Four Different Structure Types								INORGANIC CHEMISTRY				59	7			4685	4692		10.1021/acs.inorgchem.9b03774				APR 6 2020	2020	We report the facile synthesis methods of four materials, with the general formula SrMnO3-delta, which have previously been synthesized in multiple steps, involving switching between different oxidizing and reducing gases, quenching, the use of zirconium metal as a reductant, etc. However, we have shown that it is possible to synthesize all of these materials by facile processes without unnecessary complications. In fact, we have found methods of synthesizing the oxygen-deficient phases in only one step. Given the diverse range of structures that are formed for SrMnO3-delta, we have investigated the correlations between the structural order and electrocatalytic activity for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) of water splitting. We have uncovered a systematic trend in the OER activity, where the most oxygen-deficient compound, SrMnO3-delta, which features square-pyramidal coordination geometry around manganese, shows the highest OER performance. The next OER activity belongs to SrMnO2.5, which contains both MnO5 trigonal bipyramids and MnO6 octahedra. SrMnO3 (cubic), containing only corner-sharing MnO6 units, shows the third best OER performance. The least activity is observed in SrMnO3 (hexagonal), featuring both face- and corner-sharing MnO6 octahedra. We have also studied the electrochemically active surface area, as well as the kinetics of OER for all four materials, and found that the trend in these properties is the same as the trend in the OER activity. These findings indicate that the electrocatalytic activity is correlated with the degree of oxygen deficiency, as well as the polyhedral connectivity.									14	1	0	0	0	0	15			0020-1669	1520-510X		WOS:000526414400054	32212686

Cryptomelane-type alpha-(K)MnO2 is one of the few oxides of manganese with promising electrocatalytic activity for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). We report a strategy to boost the performance of cryptomelane-type alpha-(K)MnO2 in OER electrocatalysis in alkaline electrolyte by thermal treatments in specific gas atmospheres. The thermal treatment of alpha-(K)MnO2 at 300 degrees C in He, H2O/He and air can lower the potential required to reach a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) for the OER by up to 60 mV. We discuss the structural changes on the atomic level, by combining X-ray diffraction, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, X-ray absorption spectroscopy, transmission electron microscopy and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. The simultaneous presence of three structural features for MnOx-based water oxidation catalysts is considered essential: (i) Mn3+. sites, (ii) structural defects, and (iii) mono- and dip-oxo bridges, which can be tailored on the surface and in the bulk. Notably, extended X-ray absorption fine structure measurements suggest that more Mn(3+ )sites are detected in the corner-sharing positions, which are suggested to be the favorable sites for the electrocatalytic water oxidation.

The nanomaterials are studied by atomic force microscopy, scanning electron microscopy, and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy. The energy efficiency of hydrogen and oxygen generation is estimated on a test stand for AWE. The optimal load of platinum metals and the temperature conditions of the operation of the membrane electrode assemblies are determined to reach a higher current density, a longer lifetime of the alkaline water electrolyzer, and the lowest hydrogen and oxygen overpotential. This work demonstrated that membrane electrode assemblies for AWE can be made of porous nickel electrodes modified with platinum-nickel and palladium-nickel bimetallic nanoparticles.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0040-5795	1608-3431		WOS:000734182700012

Here, by means of infrared spectroscopy, we investigated the properties of the two main radiation-induced defects in Czochralski-Si (Cz-Si) the oxygen-vacancy (VO) and the carbon-oxygen (CiOi) centres. In particular, we investigated the effect of isovalent doping on the production, the thermal evolution, and the thermal stability of the VO and the CiOi defects. Additionally, we studied the reactions that participate upon annealing and the defects formed as a result of these reactions. Upon annealing VO is converted to VO2 defect although part of the CiOi is converted to CsO2i complexes. Thus, we studied the conversion ratios [VO2]/[VO] and [CsO2i]/[CiOi] with respect to the isovalent dopant. Additionally, the role of carbon in the above processes was discussed. A delay between the temperature characterizing the onset of the VO decay and the temperature characterizing the VO2 growth as well the further growth of VO2 after the complete disappearance of VO indicate that the VO to VO2 conversion is a complex phenomenon with many reaction processes involved. Differences exhibited between the effects of the various dopants on the properties of the two defects were highlighted. The results are discussed in view of density functional theory calculations involving the interaction of isovalent dopants with intrinsic defects, the oxygen and carbon impurities in Si.

In present study, nanostructured NiO/PdO particles were synthesized using the greener synthesis approach. The phase purity and composition of prepared NiO/PdO was confirmed by X-ray diffraction spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), scanning electron microscope coupled energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) which confirmed the elemental composition of synthesized material. The calculated band gap value using Tauc equation was 2.2 eV. Moreover, the as synthesized material was tested as nanocatalyst which proclaimed significant electrochemical response with an over potential (O.P) of 376 mV and 108 mV for oxygen and hydrogen evolution reaction (OER, HER), respectively. Thus on the basis of present electrochemical scrutinization, it was proposed that NiO/PdO based mixed oxides could be used as efficient electro-catalyst for water splitting studies.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0026-265X	1095-9149		WOS:000573644400001

It is believed that the incorporation of a MOF network into a fibrous matrix results in the improvement of the electrocatalytic properties of the material. Herein, we have synthesized a Co-incorporated MOF-5-based fibrous material by a simple wet-chemical method, followed by an electrospinning (ES) process. The as-prepared Co-incorporated MOF-5 microfibers were employed as an electrocatalyst for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in 1 M KOH electrolyte. The catalyst demands a lower overpotential of 240 mV to attain a current density of 10 mA/cm(2) with a lower Tafel slope value of 120 mV/dec along with a charge transfer resistance value of 2.9 Omega from electron impedance spectroscopy (EIS) analysis. From these results, it has been understood that the incorporation of Co metal into the MOF-5 microfibrous network has significantly improved the OER performance, which made them a potential entrant in other energy-related applications also.									13	0	0	0	1	0	13			0020-1669	1520-510X		WOS:000671099600065	34134481

The resulting g-C(3)N(4)nanosheets were further employed as carriers for the growth of carbon quantum dots (CQDs) and (110) exposed alpha-Fe(2)O(3)through the PVP-enabled adsorption effects by a solvothermal process. It was discovered that the so fabricated ternary photocatalyst alpha-Fe2O3/CQD@g-C(3)N(4)presented a broad-spectrum absorption range (up to 800 nm) and particularly enhanced active sites of photogenerated electrons for highly efficient photocatalytic oxygen reduction toward H(2)O(2)evolution in pure water. A H(2)O(2)production rate of 1.16 mu M min(-1)could be expected for the developed photocatalyst under visible light irradiation, which is about 19 times faster than that of pure ultrathin g-C3N4. Herein, the loaded Fe(2)O(3)could transform the H(2)O(2)evolution from two-step single-electron reduction into one-step two-electron one, as verified by the various active species experiments and rotating ring-disk electrode tests. This work presents a new perspective in designing ultrathin g-C(3)N(4)through a simple method of precursor-regulated calcination, which features more outstanding advantages than the conventional exfoliation of bulk g-C(3)N(4)towards ultrathin g-C3N4. More importantly, it provides an optimized photocatalytic reaction route of two-electron oxygen reduction for efficient H(2)O(2)production in pure water under visible light irradiation, without the need for noble metals or organic sacrificial agents.									32	1	0	0	4	0	32			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000572173300024		
J	Li, Ming; Twardowski, Zbigniew; Mok, Felix; Tam, Norbert								Sodium molybdate - a possible alternate additive for sodium dichromate in the electrolytic production of sodium chlorate								JOURNAL OF APPLIED ELECTROCHEMISTRY				37	4			499	504		10.1007/s10800-006-9281-1				APR 2007	2007	Sodium dichromate is commonly used in sodium chlorate production to maintain high current efficiency; however, it is also a well documented carcinogen. To reduce the environmental impact, identification of a suitable alternative with similar buffering characteristics to dichromate and without adverse effect on the electrolytic performance of sodium chlorate production is important; sodium molybdate is a good candidate. Molybdate ion and its conjugated acid work as a buffer pair at pH 5-6, a lower and slightly narrower pH window than the typical buffer region of dichromate. Nonetheless, the molybdate buffer works effectively during the electrolytic process by maintaining pH at similar to 5.9. Although the use of molybdate buffer will lower the overpotential of hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) by similar to 100 mV, the average off-gas oxygen content is noticeably compromised at 3.6-4.6%, measured using a pilot cell operated at 3 kA m(-2) and 80 degrees C during a 3-day trial. The resulting current efficiency of 91 similar to 92% is significantly lower than when dichromate is employed as the process additive (> 96%). Mixtures of different dichromate and molybdate ratio were also investigated in terms of the resulting cathode surface potential.									13	0	0	0	1	0	14			0021-891X			WOS:000244689100011		
J	Li, Xinxin; Cong, Linchuan; Lin, Haibo; Liu, Fangbing; Han, Fuyu; Lin, Nan								Electrochemical conversion of furfural to furoic acid: a more stable, efficient and energy-saving system								SCIENCE CHINA-CHEMISTRY											10.1007/s11426-022-1404-x		OCT 2022			2022	The paired electrolytic system is constructed by combining the valuable organic electro-oxidation and electro-reduction reactions, which can replace the ineffective water splitting half-reaction. By reducing the energy consumption of the electrolytic cell, the value-added electrolysis is realized. The indirect electrolysis method greatly reduces the dependence of the organic electrolysis reaction on electrode potential by introducing the redox mediators, which solves the problem on the matching of anode and cathode current under potentiostatic conditions. Here, we report a more stable, efficient and energy-saving linear paired electrochemical synthesis system that can simultaneously convert furfural to furoic acid at both the anode and cathode at higher current densities. Stable three-dimensional networked PbO2 is used as the anode and the catalytic amount of 2,2,6,6-tetramethyl-1-piperidinyloxy (TEMPO) is used as the mediator to realize the efficient conversion of furfural to furoic acid in a wide potential range. The cathode catalyzes two-electron oxygen reduction to hydrogen peroxide using Pb/RHPC gas-diffusion electrode, which mediates the oxidation of furfural to furoic acid simultaneously. In potentiostatic electrolysis, the selectivity of the furoic acid in the cathode and anode is 33.2% and 99.3%, respectively, and the total electron efficiency is 127.1%. The properties of the cathode and anode remain stable after the long-time electrolysis in a flow cell. By choosing a stable anode with high oxygen evolution overpotential and a gas-diffusion cathode with high hydrogen evolution overpotential, the electrolytic cell can be operated efficiently and stably by introducing reasonable mediated reactions. The two half-reactions have good compatibility during the electrolysis process, saving energy consumption by about 12.3%, for certain industrial application prospects.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1674-7291	1869-1870		WOS:000866329100003

Recent advances in catalysts and anion exchange membranes (AEM) have made alkaline devices increasingly competitive with their acidic counterparts. However, less attention has been paid to the anion conductive ionomers (ACI) used in the fabrication of electrodes for AEM electrolyzers. The ACI contributes to ion conduction between the catalyst and bulk electrolyte and serves as a binder for adhering the catalyst to the gas diffusion layer and AEM. Ionic conductivity, water uptake and ionomer swelling are critical properties for electrode performance. High ion exchange capacity (IEC) in the ionomer is desired for reduced electrode resistance, however, it can lead to excess water uptake (WU) and disruptive ACI swelling. In this study, a series of poly(norbornene)-based ionomers were synthesized, characterized and used to fabricate oxygen evolving anodes for low-temperature AEM water electrolysis. The IEC of the ionomers (0 to 4.73 meq g(-1)) was adjusted by controlling the ratio of ion conducting to non-ion conducting norbornene monomers in the ACI tetrablock copolymers. Low conductivity ionomers are shown to yield the best-performing oxygen evolution electrodes, in the absence of ACI polymer cross-linking because they do not experience excessive water swelling. Light cross-linking within the anode ACI was used as a means to independently lower WU of the ionomer without compromising ionic conductivity. This control over water swelling allows higher ionic conductivity within the ACI to be used in water-fed electrolyzer applications. Other methods of water management were compared including the use of hydrophobic additives and adjustment of the ionomer concentration in the electrode. It was shown that the cell performance greatly benefits from a highly conductive ionomer in the oxygen evolution reaction electrode if the WU is managed.									21	1	0	0	0	0	21			0013-4651	1945-7111		WOS:000600947200001

In this work, the first-principles calculation was used to investigate the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) performance of transition metal (TM) single atom catalysts (SACs) on 2D SnO nanosheets. Among the TM considered (TM = V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu and Pt), V, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu and Pt can effectively improve the catalytic activity of SnO. More importantly, the low-cost Co can exhibit promising HER performance with the Gibbs free energy as low as similar to 0.015 eV, which is competitive with the precious catalyst Pt. The theoretical exchange current densities of Co SACs can reach similar to 10(-16) A/site. The exciting HER activity is mainly facilitated through the d-d hybridization between the TM and Sn atoms on the SnO surface, which introduces new electron states near the Fermi level. Our work highlights the complexity and diversity of the effect of TM SACs on SnO nanosheets and implies their potential applications as efficient HER electrocatalysts.

Neither is it clear why the sluggish HER/HOR of Pt in a base can be improved by mixing Pt with some transition metals. Herein, we constructed dealloyed carbon-supported Pt-Cu nanoclusters (DPtCu3/C) with a core-shell Cu@Pt structure wherein the Pt-Cu alloying core is surrounded by Pt shells as a model HER/HOR catalyst to interpret these puzzles. Combined microscopy and in situ X-ray absorption spectroscopy verified the Cu@Pt structure in association with the compressive strain in D-PtCu3/C during the HER/HOR. The superior oxygen reduction reaction activity of the D-PtCu3/C to that of Pt/C in both acid and alkaline solution confirmed that the compressive strain weakens the Pt-O binding energy (E-pt(-O)) of the D-PtCu3/C. The D-PtCu3/C with compressed Pt shells exhibited inferior HER/HOR activity and a positive shift of the sharp hydrogen adsorption/desorption peaks toward higher potential in comparison with Pt/C in alkaline solution. These results verified that the compressive strain reduces the HER/HOR activity of Pt by weakening Ept-O. This conclusion indicates that the HER/HOR kinetics of Pt in a base is mainly limited by the overly weak Ept-O rather than overly strong Pt-H binding energy.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			2155-5435			WOS:000670659900046

Physicochemical characterization of the synthesized MOFs was done by high-resolution transmission electron microscopy, energy dispersive X-Ray, powder X-ray diffraction, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, and thermogravimetric analysis, which depicts that the monometallic and bimetallic MOFs have a similar crystal structure. Among the synthesized MOFs, NiCo-MOF (1 : 1) (where the 1 : 1 ratio indicates Ni : Co ratio) exhibits efficient bifunctional electrocatalytic properties, i.e. it electrocatalytically oxidizes water and hydrazine (HZ). Electrocatalytic water oxidation leading to oxygen evolution can be exploited in the production of green hydrogen. NiCo-MOF (1 : 1) exhibits a low overpotential of 330 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2), a low Tafel slope of 32 mV dec(-1), and high stability for water oxidation. Electrocatalytic oxidation of HZ leads to its sensitive amperometric determination in real samples. For the electrochemical detection of HZ, NiCo-MOF (1 : 1) displays a low limit of detection (1.1 mu M), broad linear range (1-2000 mu M) and high selectivity and stability. Thus, the present results demonstrate a new scheme to fabricate an economical and high-performance oxygen evolution catalyst and HZ sensor.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1144-0546	1369-9261		WOS:000811012700001

The anodically formed oxy-hydroxide material is known to age over time causing a decrease in performance. However, this deactivation can be mitigated by temporarily reducing the potential for brief periods. This work looks at continuous rejuvenation of nickel anodes in 30 wt.% KOH solution and it is shown that rejuvenation at 0.5 V vs. HgHgO for 10 minutes every 100 minutes can prevent ageing of the anode, thus maintaining a low overpotential during galvanostatic oxygen evolution at 50 mA cm(-2). It is suggested that the short potentiostatic rejuvenation periods at regular intervals prevents the ratio of Ni(IV) to Ni(III) from increasing, thereby maintaining the intrinsic activity of the material. The rejuvenation potential must be above 0.36 V vs. HgHgO to ensure it is effective in obtaining good performance (i.e. the material must not reduce to Ni(II)). These findings suggest that electrolysis systems using nickel anodes could benefit from direct coupling to fluctuating power sources such as solar or wind, where the variability in their power output could facilitate the rejuvenation of the nickel anode. We estimate that by using the rejuvenation steps, an energy saving of 9% is possible in an alkaline water electrolyser using nickel anodes. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Using 5 M NaOH solution as the reaction medium, a fine powder of polycrystalline Bi2Ir2O7 with an average crystal size of 10 nm and surface area of similar to 46 m(2) g(-1) is produced. Structure refinement against powder, neutron diffraction reveals a stoichiometric pyrochlore with no evidence for significant oxide ion defects. X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) spectra recorded at both metal L-III-edges show that, although Bi is present solely as Bi3+, there is evidence for the oxidation of iridium slightly beyond +4. This would suggest some surface oxidation of iridium, which is also shown by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements. Magnetization data, as a function of temperature, show that the system is paramagnetic down to a temperature of 2 K, while the electrical conductivity shows hydrothermal Bi2Ir2O7 to be a metallic conductor. In electrochemical tests, performed on rotating disk electrodes fabricated from the powdered iridate and Nafion solution, the material shows oxygen evolution activity in acidic solution, comparable to the most active precious-metal oxide materials, with reproducibility over. >1000 cycles, demonstrating the formation of robust electrodes.									84	2	0	0	2	0	86			0897-4756	1520-5002		WOS:000311239300024

In this regard, various metal oxides based electrocatalysts that contain precious metals such as Pt, Ir, Rh, and Ru have been developed for OERs in the literature In this work, Ir nanoparticles were impregnated on the surface of metal oxides (MO2; M = Ti, Zr, and Ce) using a simple and ecologically acceptable approach (reduction and impregnation in water). The electrocatalytic performance of the prepared catalysts (Ir/MO2) was tested for OER in an alkaline medium. The results show that the onset potentials of Ir/MO2 catalysts have slight variations (1.552 V vs RHE for Ir@CeO2, 1.554 V vs RHE for Ir@ZrO2, and 1.598 V vs RHE for Ir@TiO2) in this reaction. The overpotential and the Tafel slope values of these catalysts were also compared and it was found that the Ir@CeO2 catalyst provided the lowest overpotential value (eta(10) = 0.379 V vs RHE) and the lowest Tafel slope value (b = 93.4 mV.dec(-1)). Herein, the activity and stability of Ir@CeO2 towards OER in alkaline media were investigated in detail with electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, chronoamperometry, and linear sweep voltammograms taken at different temperatures.

Physical Barricading at the Nanoscale: Protecting Pyrite from Weathering toward Efficient and Stable Electrocatalysis of the Oxygen Evolution Reaction								ACS SUSTAINABLE CHEMISTRY & ENGINEERING				8	41			15584	15594		10.1021/acssuschemeng.0c04756				OCT 19 2020	2020	The unique atomic arrangement and excellent charge transfer properties of two-dimensional (2D) metal chalcogenides (MX2; M = transition metal, X = S, Se) make them effective electrocatalysts toward water splitting. But, so far, none of them have been able to replace noble-metal catalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), and it remains a great challenge to develop these catalysts. Specifically, cost-effective and earth-abundant FeS2 has shown potential, but it is less acknowledged due to the associated weathering process. Here, we report a spin-coated TiO2 layer on hydrothermally synthesized 2D-FeS2 nanoplates to control weathering through physical barricading at the nanoscale. Notably, the electrochemical and chemical weathering studies suggest that the TiO2 layer stabilized FeS2 oxidation in alkaline solution, while the latter gets oxidized without TiO2 overlayers. To the best of our knowledge, this would be the first report on an FeS2/TiO2 photoanode for efficient and stable OER without any composite or doping. It displayed improved long-term durability of OER activity. Moreover, the annealed crystalline leaky TiO2 layer (similar to 72 nm) remarkably displayed enhanced charge transfer at the FeS2/TiO2 interface. Also, Mott-Schottky measurements confirmed that the leaky TiO2 served as a protective layer (physical barrier) against the weathering of FeS2. The current study may provide new insights into the rational design of low-cost FeS2/TiO2 layered electrocatalysts for OER and renewable energy applications.									8	0	0	0	0	0	8			2168-0485			WOS:000584349900017		
J	Wang, Yaqin; Xu, Xinxin; Liu, Luyao; Chen, Jin; Shi, Guimei								A coordination polymer-derived Co3O4/Co-N@NMC composite material as a Zn-air battery cathode electrocatalyst and microwave absorber								DALTON TRANSACTIONS				48	21			7150	7157		10.1039/c8dt03792b				JUN 7 2019	2019	Zn-air batteries, promising energy storage equipment with high energy density, light weight and a compact structure, are a perfect power source for electric vehicles. For a Zn-air battery, the activity of the air cathode electrocatalyst plays an important role in its performance. Here, employing a coordination polymer as a precursor, a composite material built from Co3O4 and Co-N active centres with nitrogen-doped mesoporous carbon as a matrix has been synthesized successfully. This composite material possesses outstanding activity and stability in the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) processes. It possesses a small half-wave potential (ORR1/2 = 0.786 V) and low overpotential (OER10 = 1.575 V) for the ORR and OER, respectively. With this composite material as an air cathode electrocatalyst, a rechargeable Zn-air battery was assembled successfully. During the discharge process, the maximum power density of this Zn-air battery is 122 mW cm(-2) at 0.76 V. The specific capacity of this battery is 505 mA h g(-1) at 25 mA cm(-2). The voltage gap between the charge and discharge processes is only 0.744 V at 10 mA cm(-2) and 1.308 V at 100 mA cm(-2). This rechargeable battery also shows promising stability after long-term charge-discharge experiments. Furthermore, the composite material also exhibits outstanding microwave adsorption properties. Its maximum reflection loss (RL) arrives at -13.9 dB with a thickness of only 1.0 mm. Thus, we find that coordination polymers are an ideal precursor for Zn-air battery cathode electrocatalysts and microwave absorbers.									11	1	0	0	0	0	11			1477-9226	1477-9234		WOS:000472454100014	30334054

Herein, the reaction of cyclohexanediamine with 5,15-di[3',5'-diformyl(1,1'-biphenyl)]porphyrin affords a porphyrin tubular organic cage, PTC-1(2H). Transient absorption spectroscopy in solution reveals much prolonged triplet lifetime of PTC-1(2H) relative to monomer reference, illustrating the unique photophysical behavior of cagelike photosensitizer. The long triplet lifetime ensures high-efficiency singlet oxygen evolution according to homogeneous photo-bleach experiment, electron spin-resonance spectroscopy, and aerobic photo-oxidation of benzylamine. Furthermore, microporous supramolecular framework of PTC-1 (2H) is able to promote the heterogeneous photo-oxidation of various primary amines with conversion efficiency above 99% under visible light irradiation. These results indicate the great application potentials of porous organic cages in heterogeneous phase.									70	1	0	0	5	0	70			2041-1723			WOS:000564290500001	32103004

As a cheaper alternative to platinum (Pt), ruthenium (Ru) has similar bond strength with hydrogen. In this work, we develop carbon fiber-supported cobalt carbonate hydroxides nanowires for the deposition of Ru (CF@Ru-CoCH NWs) and achieve high HER performance under alkaline condition. Such novel catalyst exhibits a low Tafel slope (65 mV dec(-1)), small overpotential of, respectively, 66 and 121 mV at geometrical current density of -10 and -100 mA cm(-2). The superior performance, comparable to commercial Pt for HER, is attributed to the synergistic effect from Ru nanoparticles (NPs) and cobalt carbonate hydroxides nanowires (CoCH NWs). Dual-pathway kinetic analysis confirms that the CoCH NWs are able to lower the energy barrier of the Volmer step while Ru improves the Heyrovsky step to form hydrogen gas, thereby enhancing overall HER activity.

Combination of alpha-Co(OH)(2) and carbon nanotubes (CNTs) can improve their conductivity, but it is difficult to build sufficient interface contact between them due to the mismatched hydrophobicity. Herein, we demonstrate a facile method to in situ grow alpha-Co(OH)(2) nanosheets (NSs) on graphene nanoribbons (GNRs), an intriguing belt-like conductive material after oxidative unzipping of CNTs. Owing to the rich of functional groups, the GNRs can be utilized as substrate in solution to prepare dispersive alpha-Co(OH)(2) nanosheets on their surface. The developed alpha-Co(OH)(2) NSs are well contact with the conductive GNRs substrate and offer sufficient active surface area, showing obviously better OER performance than the alpha-Co(OH)(2) and CNTs/Co(OH)(2) prepared under the same condition. The composite electrocatalysts have been characterized by various apparatuses, and their OER activities are explored in detail.									9	1	0	0	0	0	9			0022-2461	1573-4803		WOS:000460069500023

Small amount oxygen in situ doping narrows the bandgap of the GaN hollow sphere which significantly enhances the utilization of visible light. The large surface area of the hollow spheres provides more activity sites for the photoreduction reaction. The specific hollow structure also allows the trapping of the incident light for a longer time during photocatalysis process, which provides more opportunities for light absorption. Loading of Pt and RuO2 cocatalysts further enhances the separation of photogenerated electrons and holes to improve the CO2 reduction activity.									8	2	0	0	0	0	9			0934-0866	1521-4117		WOS:000382859400018

J	Steegstra, Patrick; Ahlberg, Elisabet								In situ pH measurements with hydrous iridium oxide in a rotating ring disc configuration								JOURNAL OF ELECTROANALYTICAL CHEMISTRY				685				1	7		10.1016/j.jelechem.2012.07.040				OCT 1 2012	2012	Many chemical reactions are pH dependent and for electrochemical reactions taking place at an electrode surface, changes in the near surface pH can be decisive for their outcome. Near surface pH changes have successfully been utilised for formation of oxide films and to control the shape and morphology of the deposit. The mechanistic insight into such processes is hampered by the difficulty to measure the local pH in situ. In the present paper the rotating ring disc electrode (RRDE) configuration is used to measure the near surface pH for two model reactions, hydrogen evolution and oxygen reduction. Iridium oxide is electrodeposited on the titanium ring and used as the pH sensing material. At low current densities and therefore low hydroxide ion concentrations, the pH response is rather slow, limiting the applicability of potentiodynamic sweep experiments under such conditions. At higher current densities a linear relationship between the logarithm of the current and pH is found. Tracking of small pH changes can be made by step experiments where the response is measured as a function of time and steady state conditions can be assured. Key issues for successful use of the RRDE configuration with iridium oxide as the pH sensing material are pre-conditioning of the ring electrode to obtain well defined redox properties of the film and choice of ring substrate onto which the iridium oxide is deposited.

The subsequent push for multi-electron reactivity has led to the recognition of the extremely versatile role of oxide ligands in charge compensation when there is a large redox swing. Li3IrO4 is a unique model of such activity because it can reversibly cycle between Li1IrO4 and Li4.7IrO4. Here, X-ray spectroscopy, magnetic measurements and computational simulations uncover the evolution of O states in the different steps, compared to the involvement of Ir. While the process between Li1IrO4 and Li3IrO4 is dominated by the unconventional lattice oxygen redox, the process between Li3IrO4 and Li4.7IrO4 involves a conventional change of the formal oxidation state of Ir, which affects O due to the high covalency. The O states of Li3IrO4 exhibit a very high reversibility after the whole 3.7-electron process, completely restoring the pristine state.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0013-4651	1945-7111		WOS:000667227400001

The results show that the hydrogenation process occurs in four stages: drying and degassing,hydropyrolysis,rapid hydrogasification,and slow hydrogasification. With increasing hydrogen pressure,hydrogenation of volatile radicals is promoted and decomposition of oxygen-containing functional groups forming carbon oxides is inhibited. During hydropyrolysis stage,the weight loss rate increases with hydrogen pressure for FG coal,while the hydrogen pressure has little influence on that for HLE coal. During the rapid hydrogasification stage,the evolution rate of CH_4 increases with hydrogen pressure; for HLE coal the evolution rate of CH_4 doesn't increase with hydrogen pressure any more at high pressures (3 ~ 5 MPa). The HLE coal with higher oxygen content contains more active sites provided by the oxygen-containing groups in the semichar. The FG coal with higher H/C atomic ratio is able to provide more hydrogen by itself during hydrogenation reactions. The kinetic data of the slow hydrogasification stage is k_0 = 2.38 * 10~7 (min~(-1)·MPa~(-1)), E = 231 kJ /mol,n = 1 for the FG coal and k_0 = 2.64 * 10~3(min~(-1)·MPa~(-0.736)), E = 127 kJ /mol,n = 0.736 for the HLE coal.			采用加压热重分析仪和气相色谱仪联用的方法研究了府谷烟煤和海拉尔褐煤加氢反应过程中的失重规律和主要气体产物析出规律,升温速率15℃/min,压力0.1~5.0MPa,反应终温1000℃。实验结果表明,煤粉加氢反应主要分为初始干燥脱气、热分解及挥发分加氢,半焦加氢气化和焦炭加氢气化四个阶段。氢气压力的提高促进了挥发分自由基的加氢反应,抑制了含氧官能团脱除形成碳氧化物。在热分解及挥发分加氢阶段,府谷烟煤失重速率随氢气压力的升高而减小,氢气压力对海拉尔褐煤失重速率的影响不大。在半焦加氢气化阶段,CH_4生成速率随氢气压力的升高而增大,当氢气压力较高时(3~5MPa),海拉尔褐煤CH_4生成速率随氢气压力的升高不再增大。海拉尔褐煤O_(daf)较高,其半焦中含氧官能团提供的活性位较多。府谷烟煤H/C原子比较高,能提供更多的内部氢。府谷烟煤和海拉尔褐煤焦炭加氢反应动力学参数分别为k_0=2.38*10~7(min~(-1)·MPa~(-1)),E=231kJ/mol,n=1和k_0=2.64*10~3(min~(-1)·MPa~(-0.736)),E=127kJ/mol,n=0.736。						0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0253-2409			CSCD:5511432

Herein, a novel metal-organic framework (MOF)-based growth-etching-phosphorization strategy is reported to construct hierarchical porous CoP nanostructure arrays on nickel foam substrate (HP-CoP NA/NF) for overall water splitting (OWP). Interconnected 2D cobalt-based MOF are fabricated via an aqueous solution reaction at room temperature, and then solid MOFs are uniformly converted into porous CoP arrays with hierarchical 3D configuration through a Co2+-etching process with subsequent phosphorization treatment. This unique array architecture is beneficial for providing highly exposed active sites, shortening ion diffusion path and promoting gas release during the electrochemical reactions. Resultantly, this MOFs-derived CoP catalyst exhibits an outstanding electrocatalytic activity in catalyzing not only hydrogen and oxygen evolution reactions with the low overpotentials of 70 and 258 mV at 10 mA cm(2), respectively, but also some other small molecules electro-oxidation reactions, especially for urea oxidation reaction. Furthermore, the two-electrode electrolyzer comprising bifunctional HP-CoP NA/NF electrode delivers a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at an ultralow cell voltage of 1.38 V in the presence of urea, which is 180 mV smaller than that of pure water splitting. This work introduces a reference for the development of MOF-derived hierarchical nanostructured catalysts for energy-saving water splitting. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

The as-obtained M16-ZIF-67-CNT-P sample possesses large specific surface area, quick ion diffusion, high electrical conductivity, and abundant exposed active sites, which exhibits the highest electrocatalytic capability in comparison with the control counterparts. Meanwhile, this type of nanocomposite possesses a superb anodic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) performance requiring 260 mV for 10 mA cm(-2). Overall, MOF-impregnated clusters-derived M16-ZIF-67-CNT-P exhibits an efficient water splitting performance. This method can be further extended into other systems of high-nuclear clusters with MOF materials for energy conversion and storage applications.									8	1	0	0	0	0	8			2194-4288	2194-4296		WOS:000520287000001

The effect of method of incorporation of Fe in Ni-oxo/hydroxide on the electrochemical behavior and OER activity is interrogated, and the sustainability of OER catalysis at NiFe-oxo/hydroxide is examined in the absence of Fe in solution. Ni(Fe)-oxo/hydroxide ultrathin films of a few monolayers and thicker films of tens of monolayers of Ni(OH)(2) were deposited at anodic bias from potassium borate buffer containing Ni nitrate or Ni and Fe nitrates at a 6:4 Ni:Fe ratio and were conditioned and studied in 1 M KOH containing Fe or purified from Fe. Fe was incorporated in NiFe-oxo/hydroxide during codeposition but removed from solution during conditioning and catalysis, was included postdeposition during conditioning and catalysis in Fe-containing solution, or was incorporated postdeposition by conditioning in Fe-containing solution and then removed from solution during catalysis. Ultrathin and thicker NiOxHy and Ni0.6Fe0.4OxHy films exhibited high OER currents and low Tafel slopes in the range of 40 mV/dec in 1 M KOH after activation that included Fe from solution. However, ultrathin and thicker codeposited Ni0.6Fe0.4OxHy films exhibited low OER currents in Fe-purified KOH, which further decreased with the application of anodic bias, and exhibited high Tafel slopes of ca. 100 mV/dec or higher, in a behavior similar to that of NiOxHy in Fe-free KOH. Fe included postdeposition or surface-Fe is therefore indicated to be responsible for high OER catalysis in ultrathin and thicker NiFe-oxo/hydroxide films. The sustainability of OER catalysis at postdeposition activated Ni(Fe)-oxo/hydroxide still required the presence of Fe in solution. NiOxHy films activated for OER postdeposition in Fe-containing electrolyte did not sustain their high OER catalysis in Fe-free KOH but were deactivated with potential cycling. An exchange that causes surface-Fe to move into higher coordination bulk-Fe is proposed to cause the loss of OER activity of activated NiFe-oxo/hydroxide in Fe-free electrolyte.									61	1	0	0	2	0	61			2155-5435			WOS:000506725100004

The electrochemical oxidation of Cibacron Marine FG (CMFG) was carried out during recirculation through a plug-flow reactor, using electrolyte-free dye solutions. An influence of the Sb content on the electrochemical oxidation of CMFG was verified. The highest combustion rate of CMFG was obtained using an electrode containing 6.57 mol% Sb. Studies were carried out as a function of the initial dye concentration (IDC) and the applied current density U) for this particular electrode composition. It was verified that the decolourisation and mineralisation reactions were affected considerably by IDC and j. In trying to interpret the experimental findings, an electrode mechanism was proposed for the irreversible parallel reactions comprising the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and the advanced oxidation process (EAOP). The instantaneous current efficiency (ICE) for the mineralisation reaction was calculated for the different cases using the average mass-transport coefficient (<k(L)>) and the initial limiting current (j(L)(0)) values. The energy consumption (EC) was also calculated for the mineralisation reaction. It was confirmed that ICE and EC are strongly affected by IDC and j. Analysis of the reactor voltage (U) under galvanostatic conditions revealed that the OFM-Sb-SnO2 electrode (6.57 mol% Sb) is more stable when the OER is partially suppressed during the electrochemical oxidation of CMFG.

The splitting of water into molecular hydrogen (H-2) and oxygen (O-2) using light involves two half-reactions: the oxidation of water to O-2 and the reduction of protons to H-2. To take advantage of the full range of the solar spectrum, researchers have extensively investigated artificial photosynthesis systems consisting of two photosensitizers and two catalysts with a Z-configuration: one photosensitizer-catalyst pair for H-2 evolution and the other for O-2 evolution.This type of complete artificial photosynthesis system is difficult to build and optimize; therefore, researchers typically study the reductive half-reaction and the oxidative half-reaction separately. To study the two half-reactions, researchers use a sacrificial electron donor to provide electrons for the reductive half-reaction, and a sacrificial electron acceptor to capture electrons for the oxidative half-reaction. After optimization, they can eliminate the added donors and acceptors as the two half reactions are coupled to a complete photocatalytic water spitting system.Most photocatalytic systems for the H-2 evolution half-reaction consist of a photosensitizer, a catalyst, and a sacrificial electron donor. To promote photoinduced electron transfer and photocatalytic H, production, these three components should be assembled together in a controlled manner. Researchers have struggled to design a photocatalytic system for H-2 evolution that uses earth-abundant materials and is both efficient and durable.This Account reviews advances our laboratory has made in the development of new systems for photocatalytic H evolution that uses earth-abundant materials and is both efficient and durable. We used organometallic complexes and quantum-confined semiconductor nanocrystals (QDs) as photosensitizers, and [FeFe]-H(2)ase mimics and inorganic transition metal salts as catalysts to construct photocatalytic systems with sacrificial electron donors. Covalently linked Re(I) complex-[FeFe]-H(2)ase mimic dyads and ferrocene-Re(I) complex-[FeFe]-H(2)ase mimic triads could photocatalyze H-2 production in organic solutions, but these photocatalytic systems tended to decompose. We also constructed several assemblies of CdTe and CdSe QDs as photosensitizers with [FeFe]-H(2)ase mimics as catalysts. These assemblies produced H-2 in aqueous solutions photocatalytically and efficiently, with turnover numbers (TONs) up to tens of thousands. Assemblies of 3-mercaptopropionic acid (MPA)-capped CdTe QDs with Co2+ ions formed Co-h-CdTe hollow nanospheres, and MPA capped-CdSe QDs with Ni+ ions produced Ni-h-CdSe/CdS core/shell hybrids in situ in aqueous solutions upon irradiation. The resulting photocatalytic systems proved robust for H-2 evolution. These systems showed excellent activity and impressive durability in the photocatalytic reaction, suggesting that they can serve as a valuable part of an overall water splitting system.									203	13	0	0	24	0	204			0001-4842	1520-4898		WOS:000339227100023	24873498

In this work, a three-dimensional, highly efficient, and durable NiFe/Cu2O nanowires/Cu foam anode (NiFe/Cu2O NWs/CF) for water oxidation in 1.0m KOH was developed. The obtained electrode exhibited a current density of 10mAcm(-2) at a uniquely low overpotential of =215mV. The average specific current density (j(s)) was estimated, on the basis of the electrocatalytically active surface area, to be 0.163mAcm(-2) at =310mV. The electrode also displayed a low Tafel slope of 42mVdecade(-1). Moreover, the NiFe/Cu2O NWs/CF electrode could maintain a steady current density of 100mAcm(-2) for 50h at an overpotential of =260mV. The outstanding electrochemical performance of the electrode for the OER was attributed to the high conductivity of the Cu foam and the specific structure of the electrode with a large interfacial area.									49	1	0	0	0	0	49			1864-5631	1864-564X		WOS:000398838600024	28101949

Hence, to gain a deeper insight into the structure-activity relationship of acidic OER catalysts, we fabricated Zn-doped RuO2 (Zn-RuO2) nanospheres to trace their structure evolution by actively strengthening the etching process of Zn-RuO2 during the catalytic process. We found that compared to pure pickling (C-Zn-RuO2), in situ electrochemical etching (E-Zn-RuO2) enables a more thorough surface evolution of the Ru center, ensuring superior OER activity through well-dispersed nanocrystals, more defects and an appropriate electronic structure. The resulting E-Zn-RuO2 only requires 190 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2). Furthermore, E-Zn-RuO2 underwent a pre-oxidation and irreversible surface reconstruction to form a stable active surface, thus it can steadily operate for 60 h at the constant 10 mA cm(-2), obviously surpassing C-Zn-RuO2 (15 h). Here, Zn atoms can not only promote the change of electronic structure during electrical activation, but they also elevate the OER activity in acidic media. Theoretical calculation confirms that the Ru-O band has been shortened after Zn doping, which is conducive to a longer lifetime. Besides, the water oxidation proceeds via a new mechanism, where the deprotonation of the -OH species can stabilize the -OO groups on the Ru sites.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000827156000001

Thus, its valorization is important. Additives such as Al2O3 can be utilized to modify the composition and mineralogy of the slag provided that a fast and effective dissolution of these additives in molten slags can be ensured. With this in mind, the dissolution of Al2O3 particles in molten BOF slag has been investigated between 1500 and 1600 degrees C. In all cases, a dissolution zone forms around the dissolving particle which limits the dissolution rate in the melt under natural convection conditions. The dissolution in the current system is found to be an indirect process, wherein crystalline reaction products like CaAl4O7 (CA(2)) and CaAl2O4 (CA) form on the surface of the particles. CA forms at 1500 degrees C and CA(2) at 1600 degrees C. These reaction products form a continuous layer on the surface of the dissolving particles but the thickness of this reaction layer remains limited. The experimental data have been utilized to evaluate the dissolution paths. Near the Al2O3/slag interface, the inter-diffusion of Al2O3 and CaO occurs due to which the dissolution path shifts towards the Al2O3-CaO binary system. A phenomenological model is presented to explain the evolution of the dissolution process in the current system, wherein the kinetics of the process is used to explain the reaction products formed at 1500 degrees C and 1600 degrees C.									4	1	0	0	0	0	5			1073-5615	1543-1916		WOS:000475698700026

We describe here a significant extension of this work to the study of bimolecular reactions initiated in a similar manner. Specifically, we have observed the infrared activated CO oxidation reaction (CO(ads) + O-(ads) -> CO2(g)) on isolated platinum oxide cations, PtnOm+. Small platinum cluster oxides PtnOm + (n = 3-7, m = 2, 4), have been decorated with CO molecules and subjected to multiple photon infrared excitation in the range 400-2200 cm(-1) using the Free Electron Laser for Infrared eXperiments (FELIX). The PtnOmCO+ clusters have been characterised by infrared multiple photon dissociation spectroscopy using messenger atom tagging. Evidence is observed for isomers involving both dissociatively and molecularly adsorbed oxygen on the cluster surface. Further information is obtained on the evolution of the cluster structure with number of platinum atoms and CO coverage. In separate experiments, PtnOmCO+ clusters have been subjected to infrared heating via the CO stretch around 2100 cm(-1). On all clusters investigated, the CO oxidation reaction, indicated by CO2 loss and production of PtnOm-1+, is found to compete effectively with the CO desorption channel. The experimental observations are compared with the results of preliminary DFT calculations in order to identify both cluster structures and plausible mechanisms for the surface reaction.									22	0	0	0	1	0	22			1359-6640			WOS:000309137600012	23230771

Correlation with Hill's reaction activities								JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL AND FOOD CHEMISTRY				44	1			290	295		10.1021/jf950337y				JAN 1996	1996	The redox behavior of cacalol, a natural product, and its semisynthetic derivatives, which were found acting as electron transport inhibitors in photosystem II, was examined by cyclic voltammetry. The studied compounds were cacalol (1), 2-acetylcacalol (2), cacalol acetate (3), 2-acetylcacalol acetate (4), and cacalol methyl ether (5). The voltammograms of 1 and 2 in a protic solvent were indicative of an electrochemically irreversible oxidation of the phenolic system. The electrooxidation of compounds 1-5 in an aprotic solvent was irreversible and more complex than in the protic solvent but presented similar oxidation patterns; however, compounds containing an unsubstituted phenolic system presented E(pa), which is near the potential for the water-splitting enzyme. This suggests that these compounds suffer oxidation and act as inhibitors to the oxygen evolution complex enzyme. Compounds 3-5 with higher oxidation potentials could not form a redox pair with the enzymes of photosystem II. Therefore, it is believed that these derivatives acted as inhibitors without any oxidation or reduction reaction.									14	0	0	0	10	0	14			0021-8561	1520-5118		WOS:A1996TR36000053

Potentiodynamic polarization measurements in solutions buffered at pH 4.6 and 9.2 indicate that the Tafel slopes for these two reactions are 120 and 180 mV decade-1 respectively. The anodic Tafel slope is consistent with oxygen evolution involving a rate-limiting one-electron transfer step. The higher value of the cathodic Tafel slope suggests that the cathodic process is partially diffusion-limited. Addition of Cl-, SO42- and F- ions to the electrolytes indicate that solution pH, film formation on the superconductor surface, the solubility of degradation products and complexing of ions in solution play important roles in the corrosion behaviour of YBa2Cu3O7-x.

Inspired by the oxygen evolution cluster of photosystem II in nature, Li+-doped NiFe layered double hydroxide modified with carboxylate is constructed by in situ growth on Ni foam (NFCL(70)- LDH @ NF) via one-pot redox synthesis. Herein, lithium acetate is introduced to regulate the electronic structure and improve proton transfer kinetics, thus "Two birds with one stone". The targeted product exhibits highly improved OER performance in 1 M KOH at room temperature (159 and 224 mV at 10 and 100 mA cm(-2)), as well as dramatically decreased Tafel slope (47.9 mV dec(-1)). Control experiments and theoretical calculations uncover that the presence of Li+ modulates the local electronic structure and stabilizes the OOH* intermediate. Specifically, the carboxylate ligands serve as relays to promote proton transfer efficiency, which is similar to the concerted proton electrons transfer in photosystem II. Moreover, NFCL(70)- LDH @ NF maintains the excellent performance over a month under the simulated industrial condition. The exploration of high performance, triggered synergistically by Li+ doping and acetate-modifying, sheds light on the design of organic-inorganic hybrid electrocatalysts for highly efficient OER.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			1616-301X	1616-3028		WOS:000779584800001		
J	XU, XP; FRIEND, CM								PARTIAL OXIDATION OF OLEFINS - CONVERSION OF ISOBUTENE TO TERT-BUTYL ALCOHOL ON OXYGEN-COVERED RH(111)								JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY				95	26			10753	10759		10.1021/j100179a043				DEC 26 1991	1991	The selective oxidation reactions of isobutene on oxygen-covered Rh(111) have been investigated by temperature-programmed reaction and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopies. Isobutene is selectively oxidized to tert-butyl alcohol by atomic oxygen on Rh(111) with coverages in the range of 0.3-0.5. Desorption of isobutene and combustion to carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, and water are competing processes. One C-O, one C-H and one O-H bond are formed during the oxidation of isobutene to tert-butyl alcohol. No reversible C-H bond activation and, specifically, no allylic C-H bond breaking is induced in the isobutene that reacts to produce tert-butyl alcohol. We propose that oxygen directly adds to the 2-carbon of isobutene followed by C-H bond formation to afford tert-butoxide at approximately 250 K. The C-H bond breaking of tert-butoxide and the other hydrocarbon fragments is proposed to be the rate-limiting step for the evolution of tert-butyl alcohol, isobutene, and water at approximately 370 K. Nonselective dehydrogenation occurs at the clean Rh sites of the oxygen-covered surfaces at approximately 250 K and involves both methylenic and allylic C-H bond breaking to provide a source of hydrogen for tert-butoxide formation. The product yields and selectivity depend on the oxygen coverage, and a maximum tert-butyl alcohol yield is observed on Rh(111) with an oxygen coverage of approximately 0.4 monolayers. Intermediate oxygen coverages optimize the requirements for C-O addition, without dehydrogenation, and some dehydrogenation to produce a source of adsorbed hydrogen. Isobutene oxidation on Rh(111) is dramatically different from that on Ag or metal oxides, in particular, because the oxygen on Rh(111) does not serve as a Bronsted base.									28	0	0	0	0	0	28			0022-3654			WOS:A1991GY16400043

Herein, we report a simple strategy for in situ assembly of ultrathin NiCo2O4 nanosheets with enriched surface active sites on graphene surface in a vertical orientation way by employing polyaniline (PANI) as the structure coupling bridge between the two components (denoted by NiCo2O4-P-G). The as-made ultrathin NiCo2O4 nanosheets are rich in metal ions in high valence state and oxygen defective sites, and feature 3D open frameworks with hierarchical pore structure. It has been found that the nitrogen species derived from PANI building blocks as bridging sites tend to bond with metal ions, which effectively tune the electronic structural states and result in strong coupling effects with the NiCo2O4 nanosheets. Benefiting from these structural characteristics, the as-made NiCo2O4-P-G hybrids, when used as pseudocapacitive electrode materials, can deliver a high specific capacitance of 966 F g(-1) (based on the mass of the active NiCo2O4 component) and an excellent rate capability of ca. 84% even the current density increased by 100 times and long-term stability. As the precious metal-free electrocatalyst for the oxygen evolution (OER) reaction, the NiCo2O4-P-G hybrids are also able to deliver a low overpotential of 0.32 V at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) in 0.1 M KOH aqueous electrolyte (only 70% iR compensation), holding promise for high performance yet cheap electrocatalysts for the OER reaction.									96	4	0	0	4	0	96			0897-4756	1520-5002		WOS:000381960300033

Brock, Stephanie/0000-0002-0439-302X			Role of Noble- and Base-Metal Speciation and Surface Segregation in Ni2-xRhxP Nanocrystals on Electrocatalytic Water Splitting Reactions in Alkaline Media								CHEMISTRY OF MATERIALS				34	10			4414	4427		10.1021/acs.chemmater.2c00041				MAY 24 2022	2022	Transition-metal phosphides have proven to besurprisingly active electrocatalysts for electrochemical watersplitting, but the nature of the"active"catalyst depends stronglyon the solution pH, the identity of the metals, and whether thereactions are anodic [oxygen evolution reaction (OER)] orcathodic [hydrogen evolution reaction (HER)]. In order tounderstand the origin of this activity, the synthesis of well-defined,compositionally controlled precatalysts is needed, as are detailedcatalytic studies and physicochemical characterization/activityassessment of catalysts at different stages. While base-metalphosphides of Ni and Co have the advantage of being earth-abundant, in alkaline media, they are less active and less stable thannoble-metal phosphides such as Rh2P. As a means to combine the abundant nature of base metals with the activity and stability ofnoble metals, thefirst synthesis of colloidal Ni2-xRhxP nanocrystals by arrested precipitation routes is reported along with theircomposition-dependent activity for electrocatalytic HER and OER. Phase-pure samples of Ni2-xRhxP were realized at the Ni-rich(hexagonal, Fe2P-type) end (x= 0.00, 0.25, 0.50) and Rh-rich (cubic, antifluorite-type) end (x= 1.75, 2.00). When assessed in termsof current density normalized to electrochemical surface area (ECSA) at afixed potential, the most active precatalyst for OER is Ni1.75Rh0.25P, and for HER, it is Rh1.75Ni0.25P. Evaluation of X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, transmission electron microscopy/energy-dispersive spectroscopy and ECSA data before and after 10 h stability runs were performed. The data reveal surfacecompositions to be considerably richer in Ni and poorer in Rh and P relative to the bulk composition, particularly for Ni0.25Rh1.75P,where the surface ratio of Ni/Rh is nearly 2:1 and increases to 4:1 after HER catalysis. In all cases, surface phosphorus is completelydepleted post catalysis, suggesting a sacrificial role for phosphide under alkaline conditions. Moreover, the activity of "Rh1.75Ni0.25P" for HER decreases over time, even as the ECSA continues to rise, attributed to a decrease in the more active and stable Rh sitesrelative to Ni on the surface. In contrast, the enhancement in OER activity of Ni2P with 12.5% Rh incorporation is attributed torestructuring upon phase segregation of Rh, suggesting that the noble metal may also play a sacrificial role and not directlyparticipate in OER catalysis. The roles of minority noble metals (Rh) in base-metal phosphides for OER and of minority base metalsin noble-metal (Rh) phosphides for HER are discussed in light of related data on Co2-xRhxP									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0897-4756	1520-5002		WOS:000805874800016

The physical properties of the synthesized oxide such as functionality, morphology and optic were characterized by the FT-IR, XRD and UV-Visible analysis. The diffuse reflectance gives a direct optical gap of 1.77 eV, a further indirect transition was also determined. The conduction mechanism is assigned to the low polaron lattice and curiously, CuBi2O4 acts as n-type semiconductor unlike other spinels. The potentials of the electronic bands are determined by photo-electrochemistry, which predicts the interfacial reactions on the spinel. A flat band potential of 0.38 V-SCE was determined from the capacitance measurement in Na2SO4 (0.1 M) medium. According to the capacitance measurement, the valence band (1.95 V-SCE) is more anodic than the O-2/H2O level (similar to 0.65 V-SCE) at pH similar to 7. Therefore, oxygen is spontaneously evolved on the junction spinel/Na2SO4 electrolyte under visible light, due to the low O-2 overvoltage. A quantum conversion efficiency of 5% is obtained within 14 min under visible light (6.28 x 10(16) photons s(-1)), with an average rate O-2 evolution of 75 mu mol g(-1) min(-1).									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1878-5190	1878-5204		WOS:000825001000001

The methodology is based on the application of a series (910 replicates) of double-potential steps to a catalytically active substrate electrode, which is switched between potentials where it displays OER activity and inactivity. With an SECM tip coaligned to a given electrocatalyst spot, the dual potential step is applied for a relatively short time in order to restrict the growth of the resulting O-2 diffusion layer. The SECM is then able to measure the O-2 produced while the potential sequence prevents the overlap of the diffusion layer from neighboring spots. With this approach, each spot of material in an array of Ir:Sn oxide compositions (disk shaped, about 150 mu m radius) was examined independently at a constant distance. The method was tested for a series of oxygen evolution catalysts made of SnO2-IrO2 mixtures, with compositions varying between Ir:Sn 100:0 to Ir:Sn 0:100. Optimal conditions for avoiding overlapping of the diffusion profiles generated at each spot of the substrate were evaluated by digital simulation. The results obtained for the activity of SnO2-IrO2 mixtures using this new technique were validated by comparison to reported results using SECM and other techniques.									13	0	0	0	1	0	13			1932-7447	1932-7455		WOS:000349578400003

Surface termination stabilities are significant for understanding the photochemical oxidation and reactions on the ZnWO4 surface. Based lon density functional theory, we calculated the thermodynamic stability of possible surface terminations for ZnW04(100). The surface stability phase diagrams show that the Zn204-Zn8W602,, W204-ZnaliVio036, and Zn-2,Zn(8)W(6)024 terminations of ZnW04(100) can be stabilized under certain thermodynamic equilibrium conditions. The electronic structures for these three possible stability surface terminations are calculated based on the Heyd Scuseria Ernzerhof (HSE06) hybrid functional to give dependable theoretical band gap values. It is found that the surface states of W204-Zn8W10036 termination are in the band gap, which shows a delocalized performance. The calculated absorption coefficients of W204-Zn8W1o036 termination show stronger absorption than bulk ZnWO4 in the visible -light region. The band edge calculation shows that the valence band maximum and conduction band minimum of the W204 ZnsWm0 36 termination can fulfill the hydrogen evolution reaction and oxygen evolution reaction requirements at the same time. Furthermore, work functions are extraordinarily distinct for various surface terminations. This result suggests that the ZnW04-based direct Z -scheme heterostructure can be controlled by obtaining the thermodynamically preferred surface termination under suitable lconditions. Our results can predict ZnWO4(100) surface structures and properties under the entire range of accessible environmental conditions.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			2470-1343			WOS:000663935000032	34151086

Enhancing the thermodynamics and/or kinetics of electrocatalytic reactions and redox property through organic?inorganic nanohybrids represents one of the most powerful strategies to boost the electrocatalytic performance of hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Herein, a rational design of carbon-supported transition metal oxide grown on a nickel foam surface is reported, which synergistically integrates the thermodynamics and/or kinetics through modification of electronic structures with accelerated kinetics by adjusting electron-giving and electron-absorbing groups. SCN? modification experiment and pre - and post-catalytic analysis manifest that the Co/Fe-N formed between the Co/Fe metal and amino functional group serve as the center of HER. Operando Raman spectroscopy was utilized to explore the OER active intermediates present under catalytic conditions. Specifically, the catalyst requires only an overpotential of 1.466 V to reach 10 mA cm-2 with good stability over 100 h at various current densities between 20, 40, 60, 80 and 100 mA cm-2, superior to controlled transition metal oxides and noble metals. This is a viable and systematic strategy to prepare metal organic framework catalysts with appropriate functional groups that can be used for energy storage and conversion in multiple applications.									12	0	0	0	2	0	12			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000646130600002

Antibodies produce up to 500 mote equivalents of H2O2 from O-1(2)*, without a reduction in rate, and we have excluded metals or Cl- as the electron source. On the basis of isotope incorporation experiments and kinetic data, we propose that antibodies use H2O as an electron source, facilitating its addition to O-1(2)* to form H2O3 as the first intermediate in a reaction cascade that eventually leads to H2O2. X-ray crystallographic studies with xenon point to putative conserved oxygen binding sites within the antibody fold where this chemistry could be initiated. Our findings suggest a protective function of immunoglobulins against O-1(2)* and raise the question of whether the need to detoxify O-1(2)* has played a decisive role in the evolution of the immunoglobulin fold.									240	5	8	0	135	1	257			0036-8075	1095-9203		WOS:000170894400040	11546867

The structure and electrochemical characterization studies were performed by several techniques, including XRD, SEM, TEM, XPS, BET, cyclic voltammetry (CV), Linear sweep voltammetry (LSV), galvanostatic charge-discharge (GCD), and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). The characterization tools of the investigated samples showed an amorphous structure for rGO and a monoclinic structure for MVO. The single electrodes of the investigated samples showed a specific capacitance of 120, 235, and 330 F/g for rGO, MVO, and rGO@MVO, respectively, in an electrolyte of 1M of LiClO4 in propylene car-bonate solution. The electrochemical behavior of an asymmetric supercapacitor (ASC) of rGO@MVO//AC was studied under a potential window of 0-2 V, providing a high energy density of 66.6 Wh kg(-1) at a power density of 19478 W kg(-1). The ASC cell showed a specific capacitance of 112 F/g at a current density of 10 A/g and cycling stability with 86.6% capacitance retention over 8000 cycles. For oxygen evolution reaction, the rGO@Mn2V2O7 electrode showed a lower overpotential of 225 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2), with a Tafel slope of 54 mV dec(- 1), displaying a fast and effective reaction rate. These outcomes indicate that rGO@Mn2V2O7 can be used as hopeful electrode material for supercapacitor and water splitting applications.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0013-4686	1873-3859		WOS:000863075000001

The adsorption and reaction behaviors of hydroxyl groups on pristine and S vacancy modified Mo edge of 2H-MoS2 (100) surface are investigated using the first principle calculations. It is found that the hydroxyl groups tend to be absorbed at the stable sites rather than react with each other within a certain range from the Mo edge of MoS2. Increasing coverage of hydroxyl groups at Mo atoms weakens the interaction between pre-absorbed hydroxyl groups and Mo atoms, but hydroxyl groups don't react with each other. When the coverage of hydroxyl groups at Mo atoms reaches one hundred percent, a following hydroxyl group reacts with pre-adsorbed hydroxyl group and forms H2O molecule. Magnetic moment of MoS2 can be controlled from 4.3 mu(B) to 1.79 mu(B) by the hydroxyl group adsorptions, but the metallic property of the substrate cannot be changed. Single hydroxyl group adsorbed at S vacancy is more stable than that on pristine surface. These results provide an important reference for the adsorption properties of hydroxyl groups on the Mo edge of MoS2 (100) surface, thus it can be better used in the design and development of MoS2- based bifunctional or trifunctional catalysts.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0254-0584	1879-3312		WOS:000793275400003

Herein, we rationally synthesized a novel Ni3+-doped ultrathin NiZn layered double hydroxide nanomesh supported on nickel foam (Ni(II,III)Zn-LDH/NF-nm) by a facile one- step methanol-assisted hydrothermal method. Results show that methanol can not only trigger the generation of ultrathin nanomesh structure, but adjust portion of Ni2+ to Ni3+ and thus to result in the Ni3+-doped NiZn-LDH nanomesh material. The nanoporous feature endows Ni(II,III)Zn-LDH/NF-nm with abundant exposed catalytic active sites and fast mass transfer for alkaline water electrolysis. More importantly, the Ni3+ doping can facilitate the available formation of highly active NiOOH phase on the surface for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), accompanied by increased oxygen vacancies that can greatly enhance the electronic conductivity, leading to the improved intrinsic activity and the accelerated electrocatalytic OER reaction kinetics. As expected, the as-prepared Ni(II,III)Zn-LDH/NF-nm has relatively low overpotentials of 320 and 370 mV to drive large current densities of 100 and 500 mA cm(-2), respectively, and a small Tafel slope of 63.9 mV dec(-1), extremely superior to RuO2/NF and NiZn-LDH/NF-ns counterpart. Meanwhile, the electrolyzer assembled for overall water splitting by Ni(II,III)Zn-LDH/NF-nm yields the outstanding catalytic activity and stability. This work highlights a feasible strategy to design and develop high-efficiency water splitting electrocatalysts via engineering on composition and nanostructure.									19	0	0	0	0	0	19			1477-9226	1477-9234		WOS:000527529300038	31913396

However, the poor conductivity and low activity limit its catalytic performance; furthermore, MoS2 is unable to satisfy the requirements of most industrial applications. In this study, to obtain a P-doped MoS2 catalyst with S vacancy defects, P is inserted into the MoS2 matrix via a solid phase ion exchange at room temperature. The optimal P-doping amount is 11.4 wt%, and the resultant catalyst delivers excellent electrocatalytic properties for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) with the corresponding overpotentials of 93 and 316 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) in an alkaline solution; these values surpass the overpotentials of most previously reported MoS2-based materials. Theoretical calculations and results demonstrate that the synergistic effect of the doped P, which forms active centers in the basal plane of MoS2, and S vacancy defects caused by P doping intensifies the intrinsic electronic conductivity and electrocatalytic activity of the catalyst. Density functional theory calculations demonstrate that P optimizes the free energy of the MoS2 matrix for hydrogen adsorption, thereby considerably increasing the intrinsic activity of the doped catalyst for the HER compared with that observed from pristine MoS2. The enhanced catalytic activity of P-doped MoS2 for the OER is attributed to the ability of the doped P which facilitates the adsorption of hydroxyl and hydroperoxy intermediates and reduces the reaction energy barrier. This study provides a new environmentally friendly and convenient solid-phase ion exchange method to improve the electrocatalytic capability of two-dimensional transition-metal dichalcogenides in large-scale applications.									10	0	0	0	0	0	10			2095-8226	2199-4501		WOS:000704184000004

The catalytic tests revealed that the binary catalyst has different behavior for the NO decomposition, being the principal differences a longer steady state activity and an increase of oxygen evolution at elevated temperatures. Characterization by TPR, hydrogen chemisorption and FT-IR of CO indicated that palladium physicochemical properties are altered by an effective interaction with molybdenum. The results would suggest a decoration effect of Mo over Pd particle. This interaction appears to be responsible for the observed modification in NO activity and selectivity.

All catalysts were synthesized by the carbonyl complex chemical route. Among PtM, Cr, Co, Ni, and Cu formed nanoalloys. M2O3 was generated with Y, Sm, and Gd, and Mo was found at a dopant concentration of Pt. The electrochemical results showed that the HER/HOR activities on PtNi/C and PtCo/C outperformed that of the Pt/C benchmark. The presence of OHad (s)species, acting as a bifunctional mechanism, favored the HER/HOR activity on PtNi/C and PtCo/C. This process is concomitant with early DFT studies that concluded that the presence of OHads weakens the H-ads and H2Oads energetics.									8	0	0	0	0	0	8			1432-8488	1433-0768		WOS:000539953200001

The aim was to compare performance of these electrodes with traditional ones consisting of Ni film. Different methods of deposition of the IrO2 electrocatalyst were investigated and the effect on electrodes stability and activity is discussed. Despite a low coverage of Ni NWs by the electrocatalyst, results indicate a faster kinetics of O-2 evolution in 1 M KOH solution and an improvement of performances for electrolysers having a nanostructured anode.

However, they are susceptible to erosion which leads to aggregation of particles and drastic degradation of the catalytic activity. Herein, Ni0.58Al0.42 alloy is successfully grown on various three-dimensional (3D) substrates via a simple electrodeposition/post-annealing method and directly used as high-performance self-supportive electrocatalysts for OER. Using Ni0.58Al0.42 alloy grown on 304 stainless steel mesh (SSM) as a typical example, the SSM did not only serve as a binder and additive-free substrate for the growth of Ni0.58Al0.42 alloy but also as a synergistic performance contributor through the facilitation of electronic interactions between SSM and Ni0.58Al0.42 alloy. The as-prepared SSM/Ni0.58Al0.42 catalyst displayed overpotential of 251 mV at 10 mA cm(-2), which is superior to its SSM/Ni counterpart and most of the recently reported Ni-based alloy electrocatalysts. More importantly, Ni(0.58)Al(0.42 )alloy was also grown on other 3D conductive substrates such as nickel foam, NF (denoted NF/Ni0.58Al0.42) and carbon cloth, CC (denoted CC/Ni0.58Al0.42), which also displayed excellent OER performance. The integration of NiAl-based alloys on various conductive substrates as binder- and additive-free electrocatalysts create opportunities for the design of self-supportive metallic alloys for efficient water splitting.

Properties of the prepared materials are compared. The best route is selected and used to prepare a Ni1+xCo2-xO4 (-1 <= x <= 1) series of materials in order to investigate their catalytic activity towards the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The results show that hydroxide preparation yields NiCo2O4 oxide with the highest activity. 325 degrees C is identified as the optimum calcination temperature. Subsequently, the catalysts are tested in an electrolysis cell. To prepare an anode catalyst layer based on NiCo2O4 catalyst on top of a nickel foam substrate for membrane electrode assembly (MEA) construction, following polymer binders are used: anion-selective quaternized polyphenylene oxide (qPPO), inert polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE (R)), and cation-selective Nafion (R). qPPO ionomer containing MEA exhibited highest OER activity. The current density obtained using a MEA containing qPPO binder attains a value of 135 mA cm(-2) at a cell voltage of 1.85 V. After 7 h chronopotentiometric experiment at a constant current density of 225 mA cm 2, the MEA employing PTFE (R) binder shows higher stability than the other binders in alkaline water electrolysis at 50 degrees C. Under similar conditions, stability of the PTFE (R)-binding MEA is examined for 135 h. Crown Copyright (C) 2017 Published by Elsevier B.V.

Herein, chlorine doped graphitic carbon nitride (Cl-doped g-C3N4) nanorings have been designed as a superior photocatalyst for pollutant degradation and oxygen evolution reaction ( OER). Remarkably, Cl-doped g-C3N4 nanorings display enhanced OER performance with a small overpotential of approximately 290 mV at current density of 10 mA cm(-2) and Tafel slope of 83 mV dec(-1), possessing comparable OER activity to precious metal oxides RuO2 and IrO2/C. The excellent catalytic performance of Cl-doped g-C 3 N 4 nanorings originates from the strong oxidation capability, abundant active sites exposed and efficient charge transfer. More importantly, visible light irradiation gives rise to a prominent improvement of the OER performance, reducing the OER overpotential and Tafel slope by 140 mV and 28 mV dec(-1), respectively, demonstrating the striking photo-responsive OER activity of Cl-doped g-C3N4 nanorings. The great photo-induced improvement in OER activity would be related to the efficient charge transfer and the ' OH radicals arising spontaneously on CN-Cl-100 catalyst upon light irradiation. This work establishes Cl-doped g-C3N4 nanorings as a highly competitive metal-free candidate for photoelectrochemical energy conversion and environmental cleaning application.

Recent studies show that hydroxyl modification on the surface of catalysts can ameliorate hydrophilicity and catalytic activity, thus helping to bring such catalysts closer to scale-up and commercialization stages. To deeply understand the effect of hydroxyl, atomic-level dispersed FeOx in porous carbon nitride (CN-FeOx) was proposed through a spatially confined approach, which involved an in situ coordination effect between resorcinol and Fe ions. After hydroxyl modification, the generated CN-FeOx-OH hybrid material displayed significantly enhanced mass activity compared to CN-FeOx and commercial RuO2 (0.16 A/mgmetal) under an overpotential of 350 mV versus RHE. Additionally, the improved stability of CNFeOx-OH suppresses migration and aggregation. The DFT calculations revealed a distinct catalytic mechanism in which the active center composed of multisites modified by hydroxyl exhibited a strong synergistic effect to modulate the adsorption behaviors of OH and O intermediates, which possessed the optimal adsorption energy for enhanced activity as compared with a single site in the CN-FeOx-OH and CN-FeOx, respectively. The adopted strategies in this paper can effectively promote the application of Fe-based catalysts in OER.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			2155-5435			WOS:000813581000001

Here, we perform first-principles calculations to gain a comprehensive understanding on the structure-property relationship of the metal macrocyclic complex systems. Various modifications of the complexes are considered, including centered metal, axial ligand, coordination atom, substituent, and macrocycles. Based on simulation, introduction of appropriate apical ligand can improve the performance of all the three metals, whereas replacement of nitrogen with oxygen or carbon as the coordination atoms may enhance the Ni-centered systems. The antiaromatic ring stabilizes the *OOH intermediate, whereas the macrocycle with reduced electron density inhibits the binding with oxygen. By regulating the coordination environment, the overpotential can be significantly reduced. This work may assist the rational design of ORR catalysts and is of great significance for the future development of oxygen reduction catalysts.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1				2589-0042		WOS:000836817000001	35769883

However, few metal-free NPC catalysts exhibit an oxygen reduction reaction performance better than Pt catalysts, together with high oxygen evolution reaction catalytic activity. Herein, an efficient oxygen electrocatalyst based on highly integrated carbon nanofiber (CNF) and NPC aerogels, with CNF as the core and NPC as the shell, is demonstrated. The NPC@CNF aerogels are prepared through a large-scale, direct pyrolysis of metal-organic frameworks and bacterial cellulose hybrids. This mono-doped carbon material with nitrogen heteroatoms displays outstanding bifunctional performance compared to the individual counterparts, which demonstrates the effectiveness of morphological and structural engineering. Density functional theory calculations reveal that the active sites with the participation of multi-electrons weaken the O-O bond and facilitate the four-electron oxygen reduction in the dissociation pathway. The ZAB based on the NPC@CNF air electrode exhibits a peak density of 96 mW cm(-2) and a stable charge-discharge durability of over 420 cycles with an overpotential increase of only 0.10 V, indicating that the mono-doped NPC@CNF performs as one of the best bifunctional catalysts among those recently reported metal-based and metal-free catalysts.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			2196-0216			WOS:000608280300001

The present work demonstrates the facile synthesis of Zn substituted MnCo2O4 supported on 3D graphene prepared by simple hydrothermal technique and its application as an electrocatalyst for water oxidation and methanol oxidation. The physico-chemical properties of the nanocatalyst were studied using various microscopic, spectroscopic and diffraction analyses confirming the formation of the composite. The electrocatalytic performance of the prepared electrocatalyst was evaluated using potentiodynamic, potentiostatic and impedance techniques. The synthesized Zn1-xMnxCo2O4/rGO electrocatalyst with x = 0.2 and 0.4 offered the same onset potential and overpotential at 10 mA/cm(2). However, catalyst x = 0.4 delivered a higher current density indicating the superiority of the same over other compositions which is attributed to better kinetics that it possessed for OER as revealed by the smallest Tafel slope (80.6 mV dec(-1)). The prepared electrocatalysts were tested for methanol oxidation in which electrocatalyst Zn1-xMnxCo2O4/rGO with x = 0.4 shows a better electrochemical performance in oxidizing methanol with the higher current density of 142.3 mA/cm(2). The above catalyst also revealed excellent stability and durability during both MOR and OER, suggesting that it can be utilized in practical applications. (C) 2020 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC.

In this study, the favored binding energetics of OER and HER reaction intermediates on iron-doped nickel phosphides are first predicted by density functional theory (DFT) simulations, and then experimentally verified through the fabrication of Fe-doped Ni2P nanoparticles embedded in carbon nanotubes using metal-organic framework (MOF) arrays on nickel foam as the structural template. Systematic investigations on the effect of phosphorization and Fe doping reveal that while the former endows a larger benefit on OER than on HER, the latter enables not only modulating the electronic structure, but also tuning the micromorphology of the catalyst, synergistically leading to both enhanced HER and OER. As a result, extraordinary performances of constant water electrolysis are demonstrated requiring only a cell voltage of 1.66 V to afford a current density of 500 mA cm(-2), far outperforming the benchmark electrode couple composed of Pt/C and RuO2. Postelectrolysis characterizations combined with DFT inspection further reveal that while the Fe-doped Ni2P species are mostly retained after prolonged HER, they are in situ converted to Fe/P-doped gamma-NiOOH during OER, serving as the actual OER active sites with high activity.									151	16	0	0	12	0	152			2155-5435			WOS:000489204000005

Despite extensive studies, the origin of the high oxygen evolution reaction activity upon Fe doping is not fully solved, even for one of its simplest phases, beta-Ni(OH)(2). We present here density functional theory calculations using for the first time a cluster approach to revisit the electronic structure of pure and Fe-doped beta-Ni(OH)(2). First, our findings agree with a recent hypothesis that the band gap of the pure case reduces upon Fe doping. Second, in agreement with earlier calculations, we find that the highest occupied state consists of O and Ni states in pure and Fe-doped beta-Ni(OH)(2). However, the lowest unoccupied orbitals are Ni and O for pure beta-Ni(OH)(2) and mainly Fe for Fe-doped beta-Ni(OH)(2). We argue that the two different states for the highest occupied state and for the lowest unoccupied state of Fe-doped beta-Ni(OH)(2) may lead to low electron-hole recombination. Third, the delocalired nature of the band edge states that may be associated with high mobility is not damaged after Fe doping. These electronic effects could be some of the reasons experiments show that doping beta-Ni(OH)(2) with Fe enhances overall efficiency.									16	1	0	0	0	0	17			1932-7447	1932-7455		WOS:000378196200003

Recently, the origin of magnetotaxis has been proposed to already exist in the Archean Eon. However, the Archean environment was fully anoxic. Therefore, what was the reason for the evolution of magnetotaxis in the anoxic Archean ocean and what mechanism could lead to the formation of single domain-sized magnetite nanoparticles that are a necessary condition of magnetotaxis functionality? Since the genetically controlled magnetosomes formation is extremely energetically demanding, in this review, we analyze Archean anoxic iron-based metabolism and we delineate the alternative possibilities of non-genetically controlled magnetosomes precursor origin as a necessary condition of magnetotaxis emergence. We show that coupling of anoxygenic photosynthesis with ferrous iron as an electron donor, with anaerobic respiration with ferric iron as an electron acceptor, provided sufficient material for non-genetically controlled magnetite formation. The co-evolution of cyanobacteria is suggested as the possible environmental pressure responsible for the emergence of Archean magnetotaxis. In accordance with the hypothesis of the reactive oxygen species-protective function of the first magnetosomes, we show that the formation of single domain-sized magnetite nanoparticles did not have to be initially connected with magnetotaxis origin, neither had to be genetically controlled nor intracellular. Instead, it could result from the long-lasting ambient pressure of metabolically produced extracellular iron oxide minerals in photoferrotrophs together with the emergence of local oxygen oases. The presence of oxygen could favor cells with the ability to navigate into oxic-anoxic transition zones since the oxygen was entirely toxic to Archean life. This evolutionary advantageous trait could finally result in a niche construction origin of genes responsible for intracellular magnetosome formation, which have remained preserved until today.									2	1	0	0	1	0	2			0149-0451	1521-0529		WOS:000461644000010

Prussian blue analogues (PBAs) are considered as promising precursors to derive advanced heteroatom-doped carbonaceous materials. However, the pyrolysis treatment usually results in an inevitable aggregation of active sites as well as the reduction of specific surface area, apart from the un-controllable composition and morphology. Herein, we develop a straightforward synthetic protocol for fabri-cating highly-active OER electrocatalysts of Co7Fe3, Co, N-codoped carbon (Co7Fe3/Co@NC) by annealing trimetallic CoZnFe-PBA precursors. The surface modification of cobalt species over ZnFe-PBA effectively tailors the active composition for as-derived products, whereas Zn volatilization at a high temperature not only pro-motes the dispersion of active sites but also fabricates the formation of an intriguing hierarchical structure with multimodal porosity and high specific surface area. The integrated advantages of multinary composition and fabulous pore structure endow the elegantly-designed Co7Fe3/Co@NC with a remarkable catalytic performance towards OER in alkaline electrolyte, as evidenced by an overpotential of 290 mV without iR-correction at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) and impressive long-term durability. The present synthetic strategy offers valuable insights for developing highly-efficient PBAs-derived electrocatalysts with compositional multiplicity and interesting pore texture.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			0013-4686	1873-3859		WOS:000805290800001

In this work, a simple strategy is developed to tailor the nickel metal with the collaboration of nitrogen-doped graphene and single-walled carbon nanotubes. The resulted nickel catalyst exhibits superior trifunctional activities for oxygen evolution, hydrogen evolution and oxygen reduction reactions in the same electrolyte, even comparable to commercial Pt/C and RuO2 respectively, which can be attributed to the synergistic advantages between nickel, nitrogen and carbon, mainly including abundant integrated active sites achieved by the irregular charge distribution among C-N and Ni-N coupling centers. Such remarkable effects on trifunctional catalysis elicit the efficient overall water splitting, and endow the assembled zinc-air battery with a good performance. These highlight the metallic nickel as an advanced multifunctional electrocatalysts with integrated sites developed from the collaboration of two different carbon nanomaterials.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			1040-0397	1521-4109		WOS:000476550300023

Thus, a practical synthetic strategy for 1,2-amino oxygenation is highly desirable. Here, we reported an electro-oxidative intermolecular 1,2-amino oxygenation of alkenes with hydrogen evolution, removing the requirement of extra-oxidant. Using commercial oxygen and nitrogen sources as starting materials, this method provides a cheap, scalable, and efficient route to a set of valuable beta-amino alcohol derivatives. Moreover, the merit of this protocol has been exhibited by its broad substrate scope and good application in continuous-flow reactors. Furthermore, this method can be extended to other amino-functionalization of alkenes, thereby showing the potential to inspire advances in applications of electro-induced N-centered radicals (NCRs).1,2-Aminoxygenation of alkenes without extra oxidant is a practical yet challenging way to prepare beta-amino alcohols. Here, the authors report an electro-oxidative route achieving such a goal with H2 evolution, exhibiting broad scope and application potential.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1				2041-1723		WOS:000834693800010	35908027

Borosilicate glass composition is selected for its use as a glass matrix for nuclear waste conditioning. Cerium is selected as a polyvalent element as it may be found in nuclear waste. The chosen material is characterized in terms of physical properties which influence bubble formation and growth. A postmortem optical microscope approach is used to observe bubbles in the investigated material after thermal treatment for varying temperatures (900 degrees C-1100 degrees C) and durations. To support the understanding of oxygen bubble formation, cerium speciation by X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) and bubble gas composition are experimentally evaluated. In this article, we indicate how bubbles are formed in the investigated glass melt system. It is also demonstrated that the mechanisms that govern bubble evolution are fundamentally the same and that the plot's optimum points are strongly influenced by the temperature. These last statements are confirmed by considering some bubble features, such as bubble mean density and bubble mean diameter evolutions, and normalizing the experimental time using a characteristic residence time (t(eta)) obtaining thereafter a dimensionless time, which is a function of the glass melt properties obtained by the physical characterizations. The impact of temperature and time on bubble formation is described.									8	0	0	0	0	0	8			0002-7820	1551-2916		WOS:000503462800001

Synergy effects in multi-element transition metal-based water splitting catalysts have evoked special interests. Studies on catalysts in interfacial structures are especially meaningful due to their pertinence in applications. In this study, we report the synergy effects in promoting catalytic power in the ternary transition metal Zn, Co, Ni alloy nanoparticles that embeds in the carbonized Ppy/CNT multilayered matrix. By comparison with a series of binary or single metal counterparts, the mechanism under the synergy effects are elucidated. Experimental and DFT calculation results indicate that the ternary transition metal catalysts in the N-doped carbon matrix present special electronic structure, which benefits the reversible transition-state adsorption in HER and OER and render the catalysts high conductivity in room temperature. We expect our findings inspire further development of efficient transition metal HER and OER catalysts. Published by Elsevier B.V.

Herein, the epitaxial growth of the XMoO4 (X = Ni, Co, Fe) nanosheets on the hexagonal MoO2 nanoplates are carried out. The preoxidation of MoO2 nanoplate is fatal to the epitaxial growth of a nanosheets array on MoO2 nanoplates. The hierarchical heterostructure of the vertically aligned NiMo nanosheets on MoO2 nanoplate (NiMo/MoO2) is well-maintained in the process of in situ topotactic reduction transformation from NiMoO4.xH2O/MoO2. Attributing it to the rich electroactive sites from nanosheets array, together with the intrinsic electrocatalytic performance of NiMo alloy, the as-engineered NiMo/MoO2 as electrocatalyst exhibits admirable hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) activity with a small onset potential of -12 mV vs RHE (1 mA cm-2) and a tafel value of 43.6 mV dec-1 at alkaline media. Furthermore, the obtained CoMoO4/MoO2 possesses excellent oxygen evolution performance, which is verified by an ultralow overpotential of 230 mV@10 mA cm-2, small Tafel slope (51 mV dec-1), and robust durability. The developed NiMo/MoO2 and CoMoO4/MoO2 electrocatalysts are assembled into an alkaline electrolyzer, which affords a cell potential of 1.51 V at 10 mA cm-2, as well as outstanding operational durability, which is superior to the typically constructed 20 wt % Pt/C-RuO2 system (1.59 V at 10 mA cm-2). Hence, the universal strategy using MoO2 nanoplates as Mo source and epitaxial substrate may be extended to explore and construct economical and superior Mo-based electrocatalysts for water electrolysis. copy 2020 American Chemical Society.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1944-8244			INSPEC:20099480

A pulsed direct current with high voltage produced by a layered triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG) provides a novel type of power sources to electrodeposit sub-2 nm Pt nanoclusters onto NiFe-LDH nanosheets in the absence of any capping reagents to improve hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) activity and to electronically reduce part of Fe3+ cations in the lattice of NiFe-LDH to Fe2+ species to enhance oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity. The particle size of Pt nanoclusters could be easily tuned from 0.8 nm to 1.2 nm by alternating the working frequency of the layered TENG. By loading sub-2 nm Pt nanoclusters onto NiFe-LDH (Pt-NiFe-LDH), the HER overpotential drops from 345 mV to 86 mV at a current density of 50 mA cm(-2) in alkaline electrolyte. The synergistic effect between Pt nanoclusters and NiFe-LDH nanosheets on enhancing the cleavage of HO-H bond and recombination of hydrogen intermediates to form molecular hydrogen dramatically improves the HER activity. Meanwhile, benefiting from tuning the local atomic structure and crystal defects by reducing Fe3+ to Fe2+, NiFe-LDH nanosheets demonstrates enhanced OER activity. The deposited sub-2 nm Pt nanoclusters also produces elevated oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activity with a half-wave potential of 0.84 V (vs RHE). Hence, the as-prepared Pt-NiFe-LDH catalysts exhibits tri-functional properties towards HER, ORR and OER and could be used as the electrode catalysts for overall electrocatalytic water splitting and rechargeable zinc-air batteries. With the optimal catalyst (Pt-NiFe-LDH-0.5-12) as the electrode for overall water splitting, the potential difference between OER and HER drops to 1.63 V at a current density of 50 mA cm(-2), much lower than that of the mixed noble-metal catalysts (Pt/C and RuO2, 1.98 V). As an air electrode of rechargeable zinc-air batteries, Pt-NiFe-LDH-0.5-12 exhibits much better performance than that of bare NiFe-LDH in terms of higher open-circuit voltage, higher round-trip efficiency and durability.									71	3	0	0	2	0	71			2211-2855	2211-3282		WOS:000532791200006		
J	Falkowski, Paul G.; Godfrey, Linda V.								Electrons, life and the evolution of Earth's oxygen cycle								PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES				363	1504			2705	2716		10.1098/rstb.2008.0054				AUG 27 2008	2008	The biogeochemical cycles of H, C, N, O and S are coupled via biologically catalysed electron transfer ( redox) reactions. The metabolic processes responsible for maintaining these cycles evolved over the first ca 2.3 Ga of Earth's history in prokaryotes and, through a sequence of events, led to the production of oxygen via the photobiologically catalysed oxidation of water. However, geochemical evidence suggests that there was a delay of several hundred million years before oxygen accumulated in Earth's atmosphere related to changes in the burial efficiency of organic matter and fundamental alterations in the nitrogen cycle. In the latter case, the presence of free molecular oxygen allowed ammonium to be oxidized to nitrate and subsequently denitrified. The interaction between the oxygen and nitrogen cycles in particular led to a negative feedback, in which increased production of oxygen led to decreased fixed inorganic nitrogen in the oceans. This feedback, which is supported by isotopic analyses of fixed nitrogen in sedimentary rocks from the Late Archaean, continues to the present. However, once sufficient oxygen accumulated in Earth's atmosphere to allow nitrification to out-compete denitrification, a new stable electron 'market' emerged in which oxygenic photosynthesis and aerobic respiration ultimately spread via endosymbiotic events and massive lateral gene transfer to eukaryotic host cells, allowing the evolution of complex (i.e. animal) life forms. The resulting network of electron transfers led a gas composition of Earth's atmosphere that is far from thermodynamic equilibrium (i.e. it is an emergent property), yet is relatively stable on geological time scales. The early coevolution of the C, N and O cycles, and the resulting non-equilibrium gaseous by-products can be used as a guide to search for the presence of life on terrestrial planets outside of our Solar System.									81	3	0	0	52	0	87			0962-8436	1471-2970		WOS:000257571100008	18487127

The reaction of dissociative recombination of the principal ionospheric ion O (2) (+) with thermal electrons in the ionosphere of Mars served as the source of hot oxygen atoms. The process of momentum and energy transfer in elastic collisions between hot oxygen atoms and atmospheric hydrogen atoms with thermal energies was regarded as the source of hot hydrogen atoms. The kinetic energy distribution functions are determined for suprathermal oxygen and hydrogen atoms. It is shown that the exosphere is populated with a significant number of suprathermal oxygen atoms with kinetic energies ranging up to the escape energy of 2 eV (i.e., the hot oxygen Martian corona is formed). The transfer of energy from hot oxygen atoms to thermal hydrogen atoms creates an additional nonthermal flux of atomic hydrogen escaping from the Martian atmosphere.									11	0	1	0	0	0	11			0038-0946	1608-3423		WOS:000326735600003

GC and flue gas analyzer were used to measure the sulfur-containing gases. It is found that the main forms of sulfur- containing gases are HES, COS and SO_2, which have similar evolution rule： the evolution rate increases quickly with increasing temperature and oxygen content. The ratio of HES and COS to the total sulfur amount in pyrolysis gas decreases much under 5.6% O_2-N_2 compared with that under 3.0% O_2-N_2, however, under 8.7% O_2-N_2, it increases greatly. But the effect of oxygen content on SO_2 evolution is contrary to that of HE S and COS. Under 5.6% O_2-N_2, above 93% of total sulfur in the pyrolysis gas is SO_2, but under 8.7% O_2-N_2 the ratio decreases remarkably to 56%. This suggests that under 8.7% O_2-N_2, more oxygen takes part in the reactions of C-C bonds cleavage, which results in the formation of more CO and higher ratio of CO/SO_2 than that under 5.6% O_2-N_2.			在氧气体积分数分别为3.0%、5.6%、8.7%的O_2-N_2混合气,热解温度500℃～800℃,停留时间30 min下,对吴家坪煤在流化床反应器热解过程中的含硫气体进行了分析.热解过程中主要的含硫气体是H_2S、COS和SO_2,且它们的逸出规律一致:随着温度和氧气体积分数的增高,逸出速率加快. 氧气体积分数对煤中的H_2S、COS的影响是相似的,随着氧气体积分数增加,相对于3.0%O_2-N_2 气氛,H_2S和COS的逸出量占气相中总硫的比例在5.6%O_2-N_2 气氛下降,在8.7%O_2-N_2气氛下又有所上升;而氧气体积分数对SO_2的影响与之相反,在5.6%O_2-N_2气氛下,气相中93%以上是以SO_2形式逸出的,在8.7%O_2-N_2气氛下,SO_2的比例又下降很多.这是由于8.7%O2-N_2气氛下,更多的氧气参与了C-C键断裂的反应,使脱去的硫转化到焦油中,从而也生成了大量的CO,使得在8.7%O_2-N_2气氛下CO/SO_2比明显大于5.6%O2-N_2气氛下的.						1	0	0		0	0	1			0253-2409			CSCD:2639961

Developing non-noble metal catalysts with high electrocatalytic activities is an effective way to reduce the cost of hydrogen production. Recently, black phosphorus (BP) based materials have been reported to have good potential as electrocatalysts for hydrogen evolution reaction ( HER). Herein, we systematically study the catalytic performance of monolayer BP (phosphorene) and several chemically modified phosphorenes (N/S/C/O doping and adsorbed NH2/OH functional groups) for HER on the basis of first-principles calculations. For pristine phosphorene, the armchair edge shows much better catalytic activity than the plane site and zigzag edge. The electronic states of phosphorene near the Fermi level are strongly influenced by chemical modifications. Both of doping heteroatoms into the lattice and introducing NH2/OH functional groups can effectively improve the catalytic performance of the plane site and zigzag edge site, but slightly degrade the armchair edge. These theoretical results shed light on the microscopic understanding of the active sites in BP based electrocatalysts for HER and pave the way for further improving their catalytic performance.									7	0	0	0	0	0	7			0953-8984	1361-648X		WOS:000502296300002	31557744

An understanding of changes in surface structure and composition caused by the oxidation process is important to the field of electrocatalysis of the OER. In this work, the surface interrogation mode of scanning electrochemical microscopy (SI-SECM) was used for the detection and quantification of -OH(ads) and -H((ads)) species generated at the surface of polycrystalline iridium ultramicroelectrodes (UMEs) in 2 M NaOH. This system was selected because the iridium oxides are among the most effective and stable electrocatalysts for the OER. We introduce the redox pair Fe(III/II)TEA as a mediator for stable surface interrogation at pH >= 12. This is the first time that SI-SECM experiments have been carried out at such an extreme pH. Monolayer coverage of -OH(ads) and -H(ads) was Q(0)=(1,OH) = 456 +/- 2.0 mu C c(-2) and Q(0=1,H) = 224.2 +/- 0.2 mu C cm(-2), respectively. At potentials more positive than 0.20 V, a clear change in the kinetics of the chemical reaction between Fe(II)-TEA and the hydrous oxides of Ir was observed. The kinetic results are interpreted with the aid of a simulation model based on finite element analysis (FEA). We present evidence that Ir(III), Ir(IV), and Ir(V) coexist on the surface of Ir during the OER under these conditions.									34	1	0	0	5	0	34			1932-7447			WOS:000353249500021

Efficient screening strategies for electrocatalysts can greatly increase the commercialization speed of these advanced technologies. Here, ternary phase diagrams with large-scale tuning and designated-scale tuning strategies are applied for the first time to provide a new method for screening perovskite oxide-based electrocatalysts for OERs. Specifically, the family of double perovskites (Sr2Fe1.5-x-yCoxNiyMo0.5O6-delta, 0 <= x, y <= 1.5) was utilized to understand the role of transition metals in perovskite oxides. Ternary phase diagrams can facilitate a rapid screening process, provide a straightforward relationship between phase structures and catalytic activities, and help to confirm the effects of various combinations of transition metals on the OER activity. The Fe-Co system (Sr2Fe1.5-xCoxMo0.5O6-delta) improves the catalytic activities, as demonstrated by the reduced Tafel slope and enhanced stability, while the Fe-Ni system (Sr2Fe1.5-yNiyMo0.5O6-delta) improves the surface kinetic properties of the OER, as demonstrated by its reduced overpotential. Significantly, the Co, Ni, and Fe ternary phase systems can serve as the synergistic coactive sites (Sr2Fe1.5-x-yCoxNiyMo0.5O6-delta) to catalyze the OER, resulting in an improved overall OER performance. This systematic study not only demonstrates a new strategy to allow the rapid screening of double perovskite OER catalysts based on large-scale tuning and designated-scale tuning strategies but, more importantly, also provides an insightful understanding of the use of multitransition metal-based double perovskites for catalysis of the OER.									16	0	0	0	1	0	16			0897-4756	1520-5002		WOS:000480826900062

These photoluminescent (PL) properties were found to be mainly determined by the quantitative competition between the graphene quantum dots (GQDs, average size in the range 0.7-1 nm) and the large-inhomogeneously-sized particles. Thermal induced reduction of oxygen containing functionalities leads to an enhancing effect to the PL of GQDs. The study reveals the structural evolution of the GQDs upon thermal treatment and attempts to establish their relationship to the PL property. The GQDs synthesized in this study are excellent sensing materials for trivalent iron cation with both notable selectivity and sensitivity. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Despite over 40 years of intensive research, PEC water splitting remains in its early stages with stable efficiencies far less than 10%, a benchmark for commercial applications. We reveal that the desired photocorrosion stability sets a limit of 2.48 V [relative to the normal hydrogen electrode (NHE)] for the highest possible potential of the valence band (VB) edge of a photocorrosion-resistant semiconducting photocatalyst. This limitation excludes semiconducting photocatalysts with band gap less than 2.48 eV for PEC water splitting. We further demonstrate that such a limitation has deep roots in the underlying physics after deducing the relation between the energy position of the VB edge and free energy for a semiconductor. The disparity between the stability-limited VB potential at 2.48 V and the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) potential at 1.23 V vs NHE reduces the maximum solar-to-hydrogen (STH) conversion efficiency from common thought 30.7% to approximately 8% for long-term stable single-band-gap PEC water-splitting cells. Based on this understanding, we suggest that the most promising strategy to overcome this 8% efficiency limit is to decouple the requirements of efficient light harvesting and chemical stability by protecting the active semiconductor photocatalyst surface with a photocorrosion-resistant oxide coating layer.									33	0	1	0	5	0	35			2331-7019			WOS:000454434500001

Iron carbide (Fe3C) is an ideal electrocatalyst candidate; however, its poor oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity and stability make it serve only as a unifunctional oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) electrocatalyst. Here, we report a robust bifunctional electrocatalyst consisting of manganese-iron binary carbide (MnxFe3-xC) nanoparticles armored by nitrogen-doped graphitic carbon (MnxFe3-xC/NC). Synthesis involved facile pyrolysis of a trimetallic (Fe, Mn, Zn) zeolitic imidazolate framework. Incorporation of Mn modulated the electronic properties of Fe3C and the surrounding carbon, enhancing ORR and OER activities. MnxFe3-xC, well-armored by carbon layers, displayed high resistance to oxidation and corrosion. The assembled Zn-air battery (ZAB) exhibited a large peak power density (160 mW cm(-2) at 250 mA cm(-2)) with an energy density of up to 762 mWh g(Zn)(-1), high open-circuit voltage of 1.5 V, and impressive long-term stability over 1000 cycles, indicating that MnxFe3-xC is one of the most stable earth abundant (cobalt-free) bifunctional electrocatalysts for rechargeable ZABs currently available.									36	2	0	0	0	0	37			2574-0962			WOS:000462944700022

Local structure analysis around Fe by extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) showed Fe3+ ions in a six-coordinated octahedral environment, demonstrating incorporation of Fe as a substitute at the Mn site in the LiMn1.5Ni0.5O4 host. EXAFS also confirmed that the perfectly ordered LiMn1.5Ni0.5O4 spinel structure becomes disturbed by the fractional cationic substitution and also stabilizes the LiMn1.5Ni0.5O4 structure with structural disorder of the Ni2+ and Mn4+ ions in the 16d octahedral sites by Fe2+ and Fe3+ ions. However, we have found that Mn3+ ion production from the redox reaction between Mn4+ and Fe2+ influences the electronic conductivity significantly, resulting in improved electrochemical oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity for the LiMn1.38Fe0.12Ni0.5O4 structure. Surface-enhanced Fe in LiMn1.38Fe0.12Ni0.5O4 serves as the electrocatalytic active site for OER, which was verified by the density functional theory study.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0887-0624	1520-5029		WOS:000856670600001

The structures show that the P atom can substitute one or two C atoms to form P-doped graphene structures with three or four P C bonds (PC3G or PC4G), respectively, and these structures are easily oxidized into the OPC3G and OPC4G models with P O bond. The further calculations reveal that the stability, band structure, surface charge distribution, potential active sites, and free energy of the rate-determining step of P-doped graphene can be modulated effectively by the chemical bonding states of P atom and the formation of C P O bond. The OPC3G model is the most effective and stable P-doped graphene for ORR due to its stability, activity, and the amount of the potential active sites. Another significant finding is that the C atoms possessed high negative charge, which also can be the optimal active sites for ORR Our work provides useful guidance for the rational design and fabrication of P-doped graphene framework and helpful further activity enhancement.									55	1	0	0	4	0	55			1932-7447			WOS:000410597600040

Here, the interface regulation strategy aims to synthesize a sheet-like Co2P-CuP2 heterostructure supported on nickel foam (NF) through hydrothermal reaction, electrodeposition and phosphating treatment. The Co2P-CuP2/NF exhibits extraordinary electrocatalytic performance with overpotentials of 220 mV and 93 mV for OER and HER at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2), respectively. Remarkably, an electrolyzer cell originated from Co2P-CuP2/NF electrodes required an ultralow cell voltage of 1.77 V@500 mA cm(-2) and 2.38 V@1000 mA cm(-2) for overall water splitting with prominent stability of at least 160 h. In addition, the Zn-H2O cell is assembled with Co2P-CuP2/NF as the cathode, achieving a high power density of 19.8 mW cm(-2) and long-term stability of 120 h. The electron transfer between Co and Cu species in the Co2P-CuP2/NF heterojunction can effectively improve the interaction between the active sites and the intermediates, thereby enhancing the electrocatalytic activity. This work opens up new insights into the preparation of highly active and durable bimetallic phosphide catalysts for water splitting and Zn-H2O cells.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1867-3880	1867-3899		WOS:000757548800001

However, thus far one of the limitations confronted by PEC cell to preferable performance is the insufficient behavior of photoanode for water oxidation half-reaction. One of the strategies to elevate the photoanode performance is integrating with an oxygen evolution catalyst (OEC) to remove the bottleneck of the water oxidation kinetics. Herein, an ultrafine cobalt iron oxide (CIO) nanocrystalline is reported as a novel OEC for photoelectrochemical water splitting. The CIO evenly distributing on the surface of hematite nanorod arrays not only greatly facilitates the surface hole injection, but also promotes the charge separation along with passivating the surface states. Such combined effects of CIO finally lead to an impressive 1.71 fold enhancement on the photocurrent density at 1.23 V-RHE and approximate to 170 mV negative shift of onset potential, even overwhelms the commonly utilized Co-Pi. Along with its excellent long-term stability, the CIO possesses a great potential application in PEC water splitting devices.									83	6	0	0	7	0	84			1616-301X	1616-3028		WOS:000379734000018

Herein, a facile self-assembly methodology for MOF nanofibers derived Co3O4 NPs doped carbon-nitrogen nanosheet arrays anchored on Ni foam (Co3O4@C-N NSA/NiF) is reported. Co(II)-MOF nanofiber arrays are electrodeposited directly on Ni foam at room-temperature. Then after pyrolysis at 300 degrees C for 2 h in air, the periodic arrangement of metal Co(II) ion nodes and nitrogen-rich organic moieties in the Co(II)-MOF scaffolds are successfully converted into carbon-nitrogen nanosheet arrays imbeded small Co3O4 NPs. Co3O4@C-N NSA/NiF directly as binder-free electrode for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalyst, only needs low overpotentials of 245mV to drive catalytic current densities of 25 mA cm(-2) in 1.0 M KOH, which is superior to other MOF-derived catalysts. Co3O4@C-N NSA/NiF also demonstrates low resistance, outstanding durability with a high turn-over frequency of 0.958 s(-1) at an overpotential of 370 mV. The enhanced OER performance arises from that Co3O4 NPs uniformly anchored on sp(2)-hybridized carbon-nitrogen nanosheet array brings about more active sites, boosting mass transport and electron transfer.

Here, the rational design and in situ formation of an antiperovskite-based hybrid with a porous conductive Cu1-xNNi3-y (x and y represent defect) core and amorphous FeNiCu (oxy) hydroxide shell is reported as a promising water oxidation electrocatalyst, showing outstanding performance. Benefiting from the unique advantage of core-shell structure, as well as the synergistic effect of Fe, Ni, and Cu and the highly porous hierarchical structure, the hybrid catalyst exhibits highly efficient and robust OER performance in alkaline environments, outperforming the benchmark IrO2 catalyst in several aspects. Our findings demonstrate the application potential of antiperovskite-based materials in the field of electrocatalysis, which may inspire insights into the development of novel materials for energy generation and storage applications.									63	5	0	0	1	0	63			2041-1723			WOS:000435082400003	29899558

In this work, a facile and effective strategy has been developed to obtain a self-supported OEE (marked as HNA-CA-ECA) with defect-rich (Ni(OH)(2)/NiOOH hybrid) nanosheets that serve as the active sites, in situ generating over an equally important electrically conductive NiAl with hierarchical architecture to drive proficient catalysis. Notably, the HNA-CA-ECA catalyst shows superior activity toward OER with the overpotentials of 193 mV to reach a geometrical catalytic current density of 10 mA/cm(2) with a very low Tafel slope of 39 mV/dec, surpassing the performance of the-state-of-the art IrO2, which requires an overpotential of 216 mV yielding catalytic current density of 10 mA/cm(2) with a Tafel slope of 65 mV/dec. Interestingly, there was no significant performance loss of the HNA-CA-ECA catalyst after continuous 168 h electrolysis operation at a high current density of 800 mA/cm(2) with an ultra-low overpotential of 229 mV in 6 M KOH at 353 K. Such a remarkable feature lies in the synergistic effect of the engineered high intrinsic activity, extremely huge catalytic surface area, and accelerated electron/ion transport. Moreover, the novel methodology of integrating the defect-rich nickel (oxy) hydroxide nanosheets (crystal defects) and formation of hierarchically porous architecture (morphology defects) presented in this work can broaden horizons and provide new dimensions in the design of highly active and stable electrocatalysts for alkaline water electrolysis.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2352-9407			WOS:000870984300003

The rational formation of such core-oxidized amorphous cobalt phosphide nanostructures was accomplished by homogenization, drying, and annealing of a cobalt(II) acetate and sodium hypophosphite mixture taken in the weight ratio of 1:10 in an open atmosphere. Electrocatalytic studies were carried out on the same mixture and in comparison with commercial catalysts, viz., Co3O4-Sigma, NiO-Sigma, and RuO(0)2-Sigma, have shown that our catalyst is superior to all three commercial catalysts in terms of having very low overpotential (287 mV at 10 in mA cm(-2)), lower Tafel slope (0.070 V dec(-1)), good stability upon constant potential electrolysis, and accelerated degradation tests along significantly higher mass activity of 300 A g(-1) at an overpotential of 360 mV. The synergism between the amorphous CoxPy shell with the Co3O4 core is attributed to the observed enhancement in the OER performance of our catalyst. Moreover, detailed literature has revealed that our catalyst is superior to most of the earlier reports.									83	1	0	0	2	0	83			0020-1669	1520-510X		WOS:000393630300077	28117987

In this work, a class of Janus homologous heterostructures, compositing transition metal alloys with their corresponding sulfides (TM/TMS), are controllably synthesized through an ultrafast high-temperature shock (HTS) strategy. The ultrafast sintering rate and carbothermal reduction reaction lead to the formation of sulfides and partial reduction of sulfides to alloys, while the ultrafast cooling rate keeps the homologous heterostructure of TM/TMS stable. The components of TMs in the composites can be well controlled from unary to quaternary. Moreover, benefiting from the synergistic effect of the metallic sites in the interfaces, the adsorption and desorption energy barrier of the active intermediates are significantly optimized and thus leading to the enhanced oxygen catalytic performance. Impressively, the aqueous zinc-air battery (ZAB) using the binary homologous nanocomposite FeCo/(FeCo)S as air cathodes achieves impressive durability (> 470 cycles) and power density (261.8 mW cm(-2)). The as-assembled flexible ZAB can well power the wearable devices and can work for at least 300 cycles without obvious degradation. This work opens a new chemical space for designing homologous heterostructures for their application in energy storage and conversion systems.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1614-6832	1614-6840		WOS:000854300400001

In this paper, we design hierarchical three-dimensional (3D) Co nanoparticles supported on N-doped carbon (Co/N-C) with abundant defects using a simple solvent-free strategy. With the help of templates, Co nanoparticles are embedded in the interconnected porous carbon network derived from phenolic resin, and Co/N-C is obtained after the introduction of N atoms. Benefitting from the coupling effect of Co and N in carbon matrix, Co/N-C exhibits better electrocatalytic performance than porous N-doped carbon (N-C) for ORR in alkaline medium. The Co/N-C shows a dominant four-electron transfer toward oxygen reduction with a rather high half-wave potential of 0.82 V versus relative hydrogen electrode (vs. RHE), as well as good stability and methanol tolerance. The crumpled porous 3D structure of Co/N-C with a high specific surface area facilitates the formation of N-contained defects as active sites, and boosts the transport of electrons and ions. Our work provides a feasible way to design non-noble metal electrocatalysts with satisfied properties for ORR.									7	0	0	0	0	0	7			1867-3880	1867-3899		WOS:000520287900001

Different materials have been screened at mild conditions in recent decades and 2-dimensional (2D) layered materials are considered good candidates for the photocatalytic water splitting reaction. 2D single layer MoS2 has shown its potential in various catalytic systems, and has also been used in photocatalytic water splitting reaction recently. However, current studies of MoS2 monolayers give low intrinsic activity, preventing it from practical applications. This is attributed to the rapid recombination of the photo-excited charge carriers at room temperature, resulting in poor quantum efficiency (QE). Herein, a state-of-the-art strategy to prolong the exciton lifetimes is reported, which is achieved by combining the 2D MoS2 nanosheets with solid state polar-faceted supports. The charge separation process can be facilitated by the strong local polarisation introduced by the polar-faceted supports, and tuned by changing the supports with different surface polarities. Polar oxide surface is the exposure of oxygen-terminated high energetic facet, which is known to give a net dipole moment perpendicular to its surface. Such variation in the surface properties of the support to the above metal would lead to a difference in metal-support interaction(s). The resulting composite structures show great enhancement toward the visible-light-driven photocatalytic water splitting reaction, giving hydrogen and oxygen evolution in a stoichiometric 2:1 ratio at elevated temperatures from pure water. Photocatalytic performances are improved by the prolonged exciton lifetimes and exceptional hydrogen evolution activity of 2977 mu mol g(-1) h(-1) with impressive QEs are obtained over Ru-doped MoS2 nanosheets on polar ceria support, which is among the best of the reported results of similar catalytic systems to date. More excitingly, the linear relationship between the exciton lifetimes and strength of the local polarisation is also observed, indicating that the rational design of photocatalysts can be simply achieved via engineering their local polarisation by incorporation of polar-faceted materials.									20	0	0	0	0	0	20			1369-7021	1873-4103		WOS:000600431300016

The complex nanospheres were synthesized by introducing ferric ions into, the reaction mixture used for polymerization of dopamine. It is verified that both the oxidative polymerization of dopamine and Fe(III) PDA complexation contribute to the "polymerization" process, in Which the ferric ions form coordination bonds with both oxygen and nitrogen, as indicated by X-ray absorption fine-structure spectroscopy. In the "polymerization" process, the morphology of the complex nanostructures is gradually transformed from sheetlike to spherical at the feed Fe(III)/dopamine molar ratio of 1/3. The final Size of the complex spheres is-much smaller than its neat PDA counterpart.. At higher feed Fe(III)/dopamine molar ratios, the final morphology of the "polymerization" products is sheetlike. The results suggest that-the formation of spherical morphology is likely to be driven by covalent polymerization-induced decrease of hydrophilic functional groups, which causes reself-assembly of the PDA oligomers to reduce surface area. We also, demonstrate that this one-pot synthesis route for-hybrid nanospheres enables the facile construction of carbonized PDA (C-PDA) nanospheres uniformly embedded with Fe3O4 nanoparticles of only 3-5 nm in size. The C-PDA/Fe3O4 nanospheres exhibit catalytic activity toward oxygen reduction reaction and deliver a stable discharge voltage for over 200 h when utilized as the cathode in a primary Zn-air battery and are also good recyclable catalyst supports.									56	1	0	0	11	0	56			0743-7463			WOS:000383318100018	27550631

Here, cobalt(iii) tetraphenylporphyrin (CoP) nanowires (NWs) are first synthesized at a large-scale via a simple chemical reaction, and transformed in situ into zero-dimensional CoP/NGQDs nanocomposites by adding nitrogen-doped graphene quantum dots (NGQDs) as the template and dopant. Under the visible light irradiation, no detectable POE activity of CoP NWs is observed in an acid heterogeneous system, while the currently highest POE rate on the molecule (350 mu mol g(-1) h(-1)) is achieved with CoP/NGQDs as the photocatalyst. Systematic experiments reveal that the NGQDs-limiting self-assembly of CoP molecules along the axial direction and subsequent formation of Z-scheme CoP/NGQDs heterojunctions are crucial for efficient POE. The nanostructures lead to enough exposure of the central Co atom as POE active sites and longer recombination lifetime of the photoinduced charge in CoP/NGQDs (87.8 ps) than that in CoP NWs (32.2 ps) due to the generation of (CoP+center dot NGQDs(-))* exciplex. This work provides a new strategy to use a nature-like semiconductor molecule as a direct catalyst for artificial photosynthesis.									8	1	0	0	1	0	8			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000614172600042

Dust nucleates in stellar outflows of dying stars and subsequently travels through the interstellar medium, continuously evolving via energetic processing, collisions and condensation. Finally, dust particles are incorporated in the next-generation star or its surrounding planetary system. In oxygen-rich stellar outflows, silicates are observed in the condensation zone (1200-1000 K), but, in spite of several decades of experimental and theoretical study, the stardust nucleation process remains poorly understood. We have previously shown that under these conditions ternary Mg-Si-O clusters may start forming at high enough rates from SiO, Mg and H2O through heteromolecular association processes. In this reaction scheme, none of the possible initial association reactions was thermodynamically favourable owing to the large entropy loss at these temperatures. Here, we follow a previous idea that the incorporation of TiO2 could help to initiate stardust nucleation. In contrast to these studies, we find that there is no need for TiO2 cluster seeds-instead, one molecule of TiO2 is sufficient to kick-start the subsequent nucleation of a silicate dust particle.									16	0	0	0	0	0	16			1364-503X	1471-2962		WOS:000319808100002	23734047

Here, a free-standing cathode is fabricated by directly growing mesoporous CoNi2S4 nanorod arrays on carbon textiles (CNS-RAs/CT) by two-step hydrothermal procedures. This well-designed cathode structure based on mesoporous CNS-RAs owing large open space and high surface area provides sufficient void volume for depositing and accommodating copious Li2O2 products and considerable amount of exposed catalytic sites for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). The direct contact of CNS-RAs with high-conductive CT can also effectively boost electron transfer within the cathode. Benefiting from above unique features, the free-standing CNS-RAs/CT cathode achieves high capacity of 5438 mA h g(-1), and excellent cycling stability of 588 cycles. Furthermore, the CNS-RAs/CT electrode-based bendable pouch-type Li-O-2 battery in a large scale is fabricated and shows potential feasibility as a flexible and wearable power source for next-generation electronic devices.

The preparation process involves the oxidization of divalent metal ions under alkaline conditions and the decomposition of nitrates in aqueous solution containing dispersed non-oxidized CNTs. The synthesized CMO nanoparticles strongly couple with the non-oxidized CNTs, which facilitates electron transfer and improves the catalytic activity. Other composites such as CMO@reduced graphene oxide, CMO@Vulcan X-72R, CMO@oxidized CNTs, and a physical mixture of CMO and CNTs were also prepared for comparison. Remarkably, CMO@CNTs exhibit a half wave potential of 0.91 V in 1 M KOH and higher kinetic current and better catalytic durability than Pt/C. Moreover, CMO@CNTs afford an electrocatalytic OER current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at a low potential of 1.5 V and a small Tafel slope of 81.1 mV dec(-1). Furthermore, CMO@CNTs display lower discharge/charge over-potential and more stable voltage plateau on cycling than that of Pt/C when employed as a cathode material in rechargeable Zn-air cells. This work indicates that CMO@CNTs are a promising, cheap and efficient bifunctional ORR/OER electrocatalyst for rechargeable metal-air batteries.									27	3	0	0	0	0	28			2052-1553			WOS:000412776000003

However, the sluggish kinetics of oxygen reduction/evolution reaction (ORR/OER) hamper the widespread application of LOBs. Herein, an elaborate designed catalysts which are constructed by FeNx moieties dispersed on the network-like hollow dodecahedral carbon and then decorated with Ru nanoparticles (FeNx-HDC@Ru). Since the homogeneously dispersed FeNx moieties could promote ORR performance, and the Ru nanoparticles could facilitate OER capability, the FeNx-HDC@Ru nanocomposites used as cathode catalysts can significantly improve LOBs performance. A lower discharge and charge overpotentials of 0.15 V and 0.78 V can be detected in the first cycle, respectively, and an excellent cycle performance of 90 cycles at 200 mA g(-1) and 89 cycles at 500 mA g(-1) can be demonstrated. Herein, the charge transfer kinetics has been enhanced with the internal network like hollow structure and a low impedance Li2O2/catalysts contact interface could be earned by the constructed Ru nanoparticles, these factors would lead to an efficient acceleration to the formation and decomposition of Li2O2 during discharge and charge process.

J	Maarisetty, Dileep; Hang, Da-Ren; Chou, Mitch M. C.; Parida, Smrutiranjan								Tuning the Ni/Co Ratios and Surface Concentration of Reduced Molybdenum States for Enhanced Electrocatalytic Performance in Trimetallic Molybdates: OER, HER, and MOR Activity								ACS APPLIED ENERGY MATERIALS											10.1021/acsaem.2c02622		OCT 2022			2022	The heterogeneous nature of trimetallic catalyst systems comes with beneficial synergy for catalytic applications. Nonetheless, the challenges associated to validate and control the critical characteristics for enhanced electrocatalytic efficiencies are yet to be known. Herein, a genre of trimetallic catalysts were synthesized with Ni, Co, and Mo metals, whose morphological, structural, electronic, and interface properties depend on Ni/Co and Mo+4/Mo+5 ratios and the dominant element on the surface of the catalyst. The results suggest that introduction of a third metal, that is, Mo, is only beneficial when the Ni/Co ratio is optimally maintained. By combining the surface electronic and structural analyses such as electron energy loss spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, line scan, Raman spectra, and electrochemical data, it was realized that Mo and metallic Ni on the surface favor oxygen evolution reaction (OER), and methanol oxidation reaction (MOR) activity, respectively. Interestingly, the adsorbed water molecules were found to be vital for higher performance in both OER and MOR processes. The chronopotentiometry tests performed with the optimized catalyst Ni56Co7Mo37 for OER showed an overpotential around ca. 309 mV at ca. 720 mA center dot cm-2 even after 17 h (and also a Tafel slope of 60 mV center dot dec-1 at 10 mA center dot cm-2). The peak current density (from the cyclic voltammetry tests) in the optimized catalyst, that is, Ni66Co31Mo3 (for MOR), showed almost 300-fold higher activity in 1 M KOH + 1 M CH3OH solution when compared with only 1 M KOH. Further, comparative studies were also conducted with bimetallic catalysts of Ni, Co, and Mo to understand the better combinations for promoting OER, hydrogen evolution reaction, and MOR efficiencies. This work highlights the importance of maintaining the elemental composition ratios at the bulk and surface that lead to an active environment for OER and MOR processes and thereby opening gateways for a rational design of trimetallic electrocatalysts.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2574-0962			WOS:000875696300001

The formation of functional groups on the surface of the felt was confirmed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy measurements. The BET studies of the plasma treated electrodes showed no significant increase in surface area for both the rayon as well as the PAN based felts. Both plasma treated electrodes showed significantly enhanced V3+/V2+ redox activity compared to the pristine electrodes. Since an increase of the surface area has been ruled out for plasma treated electrode the enhanced activity could be attributed to surface functional groups. Interestingly, plasma treated GFD felts showed less electrochemical activity towards V5+/V4+ compared to the pristine electrode. Nevertheless, an overall increase of the single cell performance was still observed as the negative electrode is known to be the performance limiting electrode. Thus, to a great extent the present work helps to preferentially understand the importance of functional groups on the electrochemical activity of negative and positive redox reaction. The study emphasizes the need of highly active electrodes especially at the negative electrode side as inactive electrodes can still facilitate hydrogen evolution and degrade the electrolyte in VRFBs.

P	LIAO M; TANG D; WANG H; WANG Q								Electrochemical descaling, corrosion inhibition, sterilization and algae removal of circulated water and device, by conducting electrochemical reaction at interface of cathode and anode plates or nets, and forming stone mineral crystal					CN102491456-A	WANG H																			NOVELTY - An electrochemical descaling, corrosion inhibition, sterilization and algae removal method of circulated cooling water and a device, comprises conducting electrochemical reaction at interface of cathode plates (11) and anode plates (12) or nets in electrochemical reaction chamber (8) of processing device that are loaded with direct current; and depositing substances including calcium ion (Ca2+), magnesium ion (Mg2+), iron ion (Fe2+) and other metal ions, silicate and phosphate in water on cathode plate to form loose needle-shaped drilled stone mineral crystal. USE - An electrochemical descaling, corrosion inhibition, sterilization and algae removal method of circulated cooling water and device. ADVANTAGE - The method saves energy and reduces emission. When being mounted at the circulating water bypass, the device would form a layer of dense Fe3O4 film on the pipe wall of the circulating system and the wall of the device so as to block the corrosion process. DETAILED DESCRIPTION - An electrochemical descaling, corrosion inhibition, sterilization and algae removal method of circulated cooling water and a device, comprises, in the condition of that the cathode plates (11) and anode plates (12) or the nets in electrochemical reaction chamber (8) of processing device are loaded with direct current, conducting electrochemical reaction at the interface of plates or nets. The substances including Ca2+, Mg2+, Fe2+ and other metal ions, silicate and phosphate in water are deposited on cathode plate to form loose needle-shaped drilled stone mineral crystal. Active oxygen, free hydroxyl and ozone (O3) are generated on the anode plate to inactivate the fungus and algae in water. The processed water is mixed with circulating water to still keep the stated fungus and algae inactivation and inhibitory actions. Simultaneously, the pipe wall and the device wall are in scale formation and are restrained so as to greatly reduce the probability of happening of underdeposit corrosion. The Fe2+ dissolved in water generates a series of reactions in the reactor to generate hydrated iron oxide (Fe2O3asterisknH2O), just iron rust. Part of Fe2O3asterisknH2O is separated out in the form of incrustation scale on cathode plate; and part becomes the dense Fe3O4 film finally on the pipe wall and the device wall of the circulating water system so as to prevent further generation of corrosion. The cathode plate uses a titanium-base metal plate or a titanium-base metal net plate. The anode plate uses titanium-base metal coated with noble metal or noble metal oxide so as to reduce oxygen evolution potential. In the condition of changing the appearance of the device, a plate-like electrode, a net plate-like electrode, a cylindrical electrode, an annular electrode or a round columnar electrode can be used.

However, it is still not fully known how TIs affect the activity of catalysts. In this work, we study the effects of topological surface states (TSSs) on the activity of transition metal clusters (Au, Ag, Cu, Pt, and Pd), which are supported on a TI Bi2Se3 substrate. It was found the adsorption energy of oxygen on the supported catalysts can be always enhanced due to the TSSs. However, it does not necessarily mean an increase of the activity in catalytic oxidation reaction. Rather, the enhanced adsorption behavior in the presence of TSSs exhibits dual effects, determined by the intrinsic reactivity of these catalysts with oxygen. For the Au case, the activity of catalytic oxidation can be improved because the TSSs can enhance the dissociation rate of dioxygen. In contrast, a negative effect is found for the Pt and Pd clusters since the TSSs will suppress the desorption process of reaction products. We also found that the effect of TSSs on the activity of hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) is quite similar (i.e., the metals with original weak reactivity can gain a positive effect from TSSs). The present work can pave a way for more rational design and selection of catalysts when using TIs as substrates.									47	1	0	0	1	0	47			2155-5435			WOS:000366153300003

Herein, an innovative approach is demonstrated to synthesize flower-like 3D homogenous trimetallic Mn, Ni, Co phosphide catalysts directly on nickel foam via electrodeposition followed by plasma phosphidation. The electrochemical activity of the catalysts with varying Mn:Ni:Co ratios is assessed to identify the optimal composition, demonstrating that the equimolar trimetallic phosphide yields an outstanding HER catalytic performance with a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at an ultra-low overpotential of similar to 14 mV, outperforming the best reported electrocatalysts. This is asserted by the DFT calculations, revealing strong interaction of the metals and the P atom, resulting in enhanced water activation and optimized G(H)* values for the HER process. Moreover, this optimal composition appreciably catalyzes the OER by exposing more intrinsic active species in-situ formed on the catalyst surface during the OER. Therefore, the Mn-1-Ni-1-Co-1-P-(O)/NF catalyst exhibits a decreased overpotential of similar to 289 mV at 10 mA cm(-2). More importantly, the electrocatalyst sustains perfect durability up to 48 h at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) and continued 5000 cycling stability for both HER and OER. Meanwhile, the assembled MNC-P/NF parallel to MNC-P/NF full water electrolyzer system attains an extremely low cell voltage of 1.48 V at 10 mA cm(-2). Significantly, the robust stability of the overall system results in a remarkable current retention of similar to 96% after a continuous 50-h run. Therefore, this study provides a facile design and a scalable construction of superb bifunctional ternary MNC-phosphide electrocatalysts for efficient electrochemical energy production systems.									11	0	0	0	2	0	11				2575-0356		WOS:000760409200001

Over 5 days, half the organic matter and half the nitrogen content was lost as carbon dioxide and ammonia, respectively. At the same time, half the water content of the decomposing material and the chemically-liberated water evaporated. The air stream, which is needed to comply with the transport of that water, contained three times the necessary oxygen for the decomposition.Ammonia is absorbed in the precipitating water in a heat exchanger. Carbon dioxide dissolves in water at temperatures lower than 30-degrees-C, and decreases of pH of the solution whereby the loss of ammonia is minimized.									7	0	0	0	4	0	7			0921-3449			WOS:A1992HX93000007

However, there is still no clear understanding of the influence of dopants on the complex dynamic character of their chemically and potentially driven transformations. We have developed a synthesis procedure enabling the controlled formation of nanosized nickel hydroxide and nickel oxide polymorphs substituted with vanadium(III) [V(III)] ions and further investigated their structure-activity correlation for electrochemical water oxidation. This work therefore primarily focuses on an in-depth structural characterization of the homogeneously doped nanosized alpha- and beta-Ni(OH)(2) polymorphs. It could be shown that concentrations of 10 at. % V(III) and higher can effectively inhibit a spontaneous phase transformation known as chemical aging of the turbostratic alpha-phase to the more crystalline beta-Ni(OH)(2) phase in neutral aqueous media. The Fe-impurity-biased electrocatalytic activity determined for alpha-/beta-Ni1-xVx(OH)(2) showed only a minor increase of 10% oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity for an 1 at. % doped nonaged sample resembling the alpha-phase, while a 5 at. % V(III)-doped sample chemically aged over 24 h led to a doubled OER activity versus the undoped reference which transformed into beta-Ni(OH)(2) over that period of time.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			0897-4756	1520-5002		WOS:000603288800009

The decomposition of the Hbta in Fe-CC under high-temperature annealing can produce carbon sheets and reduced graphene oxide (rGO), and the presence of CNTs can alleviate the stacking of the in situ-generated carbon materials. Meanwhile, iron nitride nanoparticles (NPs) can be anchored on the carbon sheets, and the anchoring effect efficiently prevents the agglomeration of NPs and increases the amount of active catalytic sites for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Fe4N/Fe3N/Fe/CNT shows an excellent OER activity with a Tafel slope of 63 mV dec(-1) as well as overpotentials of 121 (eta (10)) and 275 mV (eta (100)) at 10 and 100 mA cm(-2), respectively - far exceeding commercial RuO2 and other catalysts. Density functional theory calculations show that the excellent OER performance of Fe4N/Fe3N/Fe/CNT is associated with the Fe4N/Fe3N heterojunction, which can improve the electron conductivity and boost the electron transfer from N to Fe. The Fe4N/Fe3N/Fe/CNT catalyst exhibits long-term OER activity during 100 h of electrolysis at 20 mA cm(-2). This is related to the dual coatings of the in situ-generated thin carbon shell and few-layered rGO on the surface of the iron nitride NPs, which can protect the fast leaching of iron nitride during the OER process. Furthermore, the effects of the annealing temperature, the PCNT template and the heating rate on the calcined products were investigated.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0957-4484	1361-6528		WOS:000847573000001	35834994

In this work, a series of NiCo-layered double hydroxide (NiCo-LDH) and NiCo oxides using co-precipitation and thermal treatment method have been successfully synthesized. Structural characterizations have been investigated by X-ray powder diffraction (XRD), Field emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM) equipped with energy-dispersive Xray mapping technology (EDS), Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy respectively (XPS). By intercalating and eliminating CO33- an- ions in the layers of bulk NiCo-layered double hydroxide (NiCo-LDH), the as-present catalyst (NiCo-CH) exhibit remarkable advantages for OER performance, including porous nanostructures, high surface area, high content of Ni3+ and Co2+ on the surface and abundant active sites. With these favorable features, NiCo-CH shows a much better OER performance than that of other catalysts and commercial Pt/C, which has a low onset potential (1.51 V), a low overpotential (343 mV at 10mA/cm(-2)) and a small Tafel slope (66mWdec(-1)).

Especially, searching for optimal materials with utmost atomic utilization, ideal activities and desirable stability for catalytic applications requires smart design of materials' structures. Herein, we report iridium metallene oxide: 1 T phase-iridium dioxide (IrO2) by a synthetic strategy combining mechanochemistry and thermal treatment in a strong alkaline medium. This material demonstrates high activity for oxygen evolution reaction with a low overpotential of 197 millivolt in acidic electrolyte at 10 milliamperes per geometric square centimeter (mA cm(geo)(-2)). Together, it achieves high turnover frequencies of 4.2 s(UPD)(-1) (3.0 s(BET)(-1)) at 1.50 V vs. reversible hydrogen electrode. Furthermore, 1T-IrO2 also shows little degradation after 126 hours chronopotentiometry measurement under the high current density of 250 mA cm(geo)(-2) in proton exchange membrane device. Theoretical calculations reveal that the active site of Ir in 1T-IrO2 provides an optimal free energy uphill in *OH formation, leading to the enhanced performance. The discovery of this 1T-metallene oxide material will provide new opportunities for catalysis and other applications.Identifying new, active material phases provides a promising avenue in the development of efficient catalysts. Here, authors demonstrate a metastable 1T-phase IrO2 metallene oxide as an oxygen evolution electrocatalyst in acidic electrolytes.									26	1	0	0	1	0	26				2041-1723		WOS:000707430400015	34650084

The MARB is connected to a reservoir tank with full recirculation containing the synthetic wastewater, and oxygen permeates through the wall membrane to the biofilm attached to it. For the two experiments reported in this work air is also sparged into the residual water in the tank providing an extra source of oxygen that diffuses simultaneously from the membrane and from the liquid into the biofilm. A pseudo-heterogeneous model using Monod kinetics with dual substrate limitation was employed to predict the observed evolution of substrate and dissolved oxygen concentrations in the MABR. The model accounts for the counter-diffusion of substrate and oxygen as well as for the reaction within the biofilm. It also predicts biomass growth and the production of extra cellular polymers, which in turn causes the biofilm to grow. Transport and kinetic parameters previously estimated, are used in the model to predict the growth rates in the biofilm and allow the analysis of the relative contribution of the rates of mass transport by diffusion, convection and growth reaction.									1	0	0	0	0	1	1			2194-5748	1542-6580		WOS:000254564900026

However, in practical application which requires extremely large current densities (>500 mA cm(-2)), the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) becomes unstable and kinetically sluggish, which is a major hurdle to large-scale hydrogen production. Herein, we report an exceptionally active and binder-free NiFe nanowire array based OER electrode that allows durable water splitting at current densities up to 1000 mA cm(-2) up to 120 hours. Specifically, NiFe oxyhydroxide (shell)-anchored NiFe alloy nanowire (core) arrays are prepared via a magnetic-field-assisted chemical deposition method. The ultrathin (1-5 nm) and amorphous NiFe oxyhydroxide is in situ formed on the NiFe alloy nanowire surface, which is identified as an intrinsically highly active phase for the OER. Additionally, the fine geometry of the hierarchical electrode can substantially improve charge and mass (reactants and oxygen bubbles) transfer. In an alkaline electrolyte, this OER electrode can yield current densities of 500 and 1000 mA cm(-2) stably over 120 hours at overpotentials of only 248 mV and 258 mV respectively, which are dramatically lower than any recently reported overpotentials. Notably, the integrated alkaline electrolyzer (with pure Ni nanowires as HER electrode) is demonstrated to reach the current density of 1000 mA cm(-2) with super low voltage of 1.76 V, outperforming the state-of-the-art industrial catalysts. Our result may represent a critical step towards an industrial electrolyzer for large-scale hydrogen production by water splitting.									385	20	0	0	13	0	392			1754-5692	1754-5706		WOS:000508857600027

For highly efficient solar-to-chemical energy conversion, revealing and modulating active centers in the skeletons of COFs are of great importance but encounter severe challenges. Herein, it is demonstrated that cyano conjugation on a typical beta-ketoenamine-linked COF via aldehyde-imine Schiff-base condensation contributes to an enhanced stable photocatalytic H-2-evolution rate of 1.8 mmol h(-1) g(-1) (lambda > 420 nm) with a superior apparent quantum yield of 2.12% at 420 nm, compared to pristine COFs. Both experimental results and density functional theory calculations disclose that the cyano conjugation can efficiently improve photoinduced charge separation and effectively decrease the energy barrier for H-intermediate generation on the carbonyl oxygen sites of the functionalized COFs. These findings present a precise organic functionalization strategy to optimize active centers on COF-based photocatalysts for the practical applications.									17	0	0	0	3	0	17			1613-6810	1613-6829		WOS:000649400900001	33979001

As novel powerful electrocatalysts, atomic Fe-N-C materials have attracted immense research interest. However, creating Fe-N-C and Fe3O4 dual-sites catalysts is still challenging. Here, we employ a facile and raw-material-sparse strategy to construct a zeolitic imidazolate frameworks (ZIF)-8-derived N-doped carbon catalyst configured by embedded Fe-N-x-C/Fe3O4 dual sites on highly flexible carbon clothe. By soaking the precursor in the iron solution followed by pyrolysis at an optimized temperature, Fe species can translate into dual sites. Our results reveal that the optimal Fe-NC-950 catalyst displays an impressive quasi-four-electron-transfer oxygen reduction reaction pathway exhibiting half-wave potential (E-1/2) of 0.89 V and onset potential (E-onset) of 1.04 V. Moreover, Fe-NC-950 based zinc-air cell reached a high open-circuit voltage of 1.54 V and a power density of 165.0 mW cm(-2). Our results also showed that the trace amount of Zn species inherited from ZIF-8 does not affect the catalyst performance.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0363-907X	1099-114X		WOS:000787094800001

This is a major bottleneck for their large-scale operation. Thus, development of efficient metal-free electrocatalysts is of paramount importance for sustainable and economical production of the renewable fuel hydrogen by water splitting. Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) show much promise for this application by virtue of their architectural stability, nanoporosity, abundant active sites located periodically throughout the framework, and high electronic conductivity due to extended pi-delocalization. This study concerns a new COF material, C-6-TRZ-TFP, which is synthesized by solvothermal polycondensation of 2-hydroxybenzene-1,3,5-tricarbaldehyde (TFP) and 4,4 ',4 ''-(1,3,5-triazine-2,4,6-triyl)tris[(1,1 '-biphenyl)-4-amine]. C-6-TRZ-TFP displayed excellent HER activity in electrochemical water splitting, with a very low overpotential of 200 mV and specific activity of 0.2831 mA cm(-2) together with high retention of catalytic activity after a long duration of electrocatalysis in 0.5 m aqueous H2SO4. Density functional theory calculations suggest that the electron-deficient carbon sites near the pi electron-donating nitrogen atoms are more active towards HER than those near the electron-withdrawing nitrogen and oxygen atoms.									7	1	0	0	0	0	7			1864-5631	1864-564X		WOS:000708103000001	34532998

The newly discovered 2D semiconductors MA(2)Z(4) (M = transition metal, e.g., Mo, W; A = C, Si, and Ge; Z = N, P, and As) have shown characteristics of promising photocatalytic OER catalysts. Herein, an automated high-throughput workflow is proposed to efficiently screen MA(2)Z(4) photocatalytic OER catalysts, and further reveal the theoretical mechanism. The four criteria of semi-conductivity, bandgap width/band edge position, structural stability, and free energy change, are proposed to screen MA(2)Z(4) catalysts thermodynamically. The exciton properties and carrier mobility of these MA(2)Z(4) are further studied to explore the high-efficiency photocatalytic OER MA(2)Z(4) with low exciton binding energy and high effective mass ratio. It is found that the bandgap width of MA(2)Z(4) mainly depends on the strength of M-Z bonding and the redistribution of electrons, while the catalytic effect is closely related to the adsorption capacity of O atom. In particular, beta-ZrSi2N4 and beta-HfSi2N4 are screened as efficient photocatalytic OER catalysts. This work develops a fully automated method and contributes to a complete framework for screening high-efficiency photocatalytic OER catalysts.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			1616-301X	1616-3028		WOS:000846647200001

J	Yang, Hong-Kai; Chin, Chih-Chun; Chen, Jenn-Shing								The Use of Spray-Dried Mn₃O₄/C Composites as Electrocatalysts for Li-O₂ Batteries.								Nanomaterials (Basel, Switzerland)				6	11						10.3390/nano6110203				2016 Nov 07	2016	The electrocatalytic activities of Mn₃O₄/C composites are studied in lithium-oxygen (Li-O₂) batteries as cathode catalysts. The Mn₃O₄/C composites are fabricated using ultrasonic spray pyrolysis (USP) with organic surfactants as the carbon sources. The physical and electrochemical performance of the composites is characterized by X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, particle size analysis, Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) measurements, elemental analysis, galvanostatic charge-discharge methods and rotating ring-disk electrode (RRDE) measurements. The electrochemical tests demonstrate that the Mn₃O₄/C composite that is prepared using Trition X-114 (TX114) surfactant has higher activity as a bi-functional catalyst and delivers better oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalytic performance in Li-O₂ batteries because there is a larger surface area and particles are homogeneous with a meso/macro porous structure. The rate constant (kf) for the production of superoxide radical (O₂-) and the propylene carbonate (PC)-electrolyte decomposition rate constant (k) for M₃O₄/C and Super P electrodes are measured using RRDE experiments and analysis in the 0.1 M tetrabutylammonium hexafluorophosphate (TBAPF₆)/PC electrolyte. The results show that TX114 has higher electrocatalytic activity for the first step of ORR to generate O₂- and produces a faster PC-electrolyte decomposition rate.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			2079-4991			MEDLINE:28335331	28335331

However, it has been a challenge to study its oxygen reduction and evolution reactions in conventional aqueous systems as the instability of Cu2O in aqueous solution, especially in acid or alkaline solution. In the present study, self-supported Cu2O films are prepared by an electrochemical method, and used as cathode catalysts in Li-O-2 batteries. The nonaqueous environment of Li-O-2 batteries prevents decomposition of Cu2O and guarantees the cathode processes. Instead of traditional strategy of mixing active materials with carbons and binders, the carbon- and binder-free Cu2O films are used to prevent the interference of carbon electrocatalysis and side reactions from carbon or binders. Based on electrochemical measurements, the discharge and charge voltage of the battery on the Cu2O surface are 2.7 and 3.6 V, respectively, behaving a lower charging overpotential than traditional carbon materials. Furthermore, the X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS) of cathodes after cycle tests indicate Cu2O catalysts is stable in Li-O-2 batteries, and the battery performs 100 cycles with no evident decay. Finally, cyclic voltammetry and electrochemical impedance spectra are measured in order to study the cathode processes and the mechanism of rechargeability. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Electrocatalytic efficiency was evaluated on the basis of electrochemical and impedance measurements carried out in deaerated 1 M NaOH solution.The results were compared with polycrystalline Co and Zr metals. The Tafel slope, b(c) and the value of exchange current density, j(0) confirmed rather good electrocatalytic properties of Co; on the contrary, pure Zr exhibited very poor activity for the h.e.r. which was influenced by the presence of a ZrO2 surface layer due to high affinity of Zr for oxygen.Improved electrocatalytic performances were obtained after the as quenched Co33Zr67 samples were chemically pretreated in HF solution. The true kinetic parameters of these electrodes for the hydrogen evolution reaction resembled that of Co, but the stability and activity in the highest state exceeded those of pure polycrystalline Co electrode.Experimental results of hydrogen evolution kinetics on the Co33Zr67 alloy were discussed using known electronic structure of Co-Zr amorphous alloys, ionicity difference between Co and Zr, as well as the free energy of adsorption and the bond strength of hydrogen adsorbed on Co.

J	Du, Xiaoqiang; Su, Hui; Zhang, Xiaoshuang								Metal-Organic Framework-Derived Cu-Doped Co9S8 Nanorod Array with Less Low-Valence Co Sites as Highly Efficient Bifunctional Electrodes for Overall Water Splitting								ACS SUSTAINABLE CHEMISTRY & ENGINEERING				7	19			16917	16926		10.1021/acssuschemeng.9b04739				OCT 7 2019	2019	One of the main goals of current renewable energy research is continuously developing low-cost, robust, and environmentally friendly electrocatalysts to replace scarce and unstable precious metal catalysts. Hence, a novel high-performance electrocatalytic water-splitting material based on a metal-organic framework (MOF)-derived Cu-doped Co9S8 nanorod array was successfully prepared. Using 1,3,5-benzenetricarboxylic acid (H3BTC) as a ligand, a CuCo MOF (CuCo-MOF) nanobelt array precursor was prepared and then transformed into a Cu-Co9S8 nanorod by a simple sulfurization process using thioacetamide as a sulfur source. It is worth noting that the intermediate CuCo-MOF nanobelts play a key role in the generation of nanostructures of the Cu-doped Co9S8 nanorod array. As one of the most promising bifunctional electrocatalysts reported, the Cu-doped Co9S8-6h only needs 260 mV to drive 50 mA cm(-2) for oxygen evolution reaction and 62 mV to drive 10 mA cm(-2) for hydrogen evolution reaction. When the Cu-doped Co9S8-6h was used as an electrode in a self-made two-electrode system, it requires only 1.49 V of cell voltage to drive 10 mA cm(-2), which is one of the smallest open-circuit voltages reported. Density functional theory results show that the superior performance of the Cu-doped Co9S8-6h is attributed to increased conductivity and increased water adsorption energy because of Cu doping. By comparing the water adsorption energy of Co2+, Cu2+, and Co3+, it is proved that the active Cu2+ replaces the inert Co2+, and less low-valence Co2+ sites make the Cu-doped Co9S8-6h show superior catalytic activity. These results demonstrate that the Cu-doped Co9S8-6h nanorod array can be used as an excellent bifunctional electrocatalyst for overall water splitting, and this work will provide an excellent synergistic strategy to energy storage and conversion.									103	1	0	0	2	0	103			2168-0485			WOS:000489986400118

Considering the unique electronic structure of group-VA pnictogens (p block elements) that is complementary to d-block elements in HER suppression, we report a conceptually new Janus electrocatalyst to tackle the selectivity challenge. Specifically, an amorphous NiSb2O6-x nanofiber is synthesized, in which Ni and Sb contribute to a synergistic catalysis pathway for inhibiting the two-electron transfer process of HER as well as activating the adsorbed N-2 molecules. Moreover, amorphization is able to produce more oxygen vacancies, thus mimicking the "pi back-donation " process to promote the NRR performance. Benefiting from this coupled element design and amorphization strategy, the amorphous NiSb2O6-x nanofiber significantly outperforms either component (NiO or Sb2O4) as well as its crystalline counterparts in terms of NH3 yield and FE.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000787898900003

In this study, we used density functional theory calculations combined with a constant electrode potential model to study the previously reported ethylene partial electro-oxidation to epoxide on RuO2 (110) in an aqueous solution containing [Cl-] = 0.3 M. We found that the high selectivity toward epoxide is due to the in situ generated *OCClO* intermediate that blocks parts of the surface and leads to isolation of *O (surface adsorbed oxygen) active sites. This step turns off the pathways to over-oxidation and drives the reaction toward epoxide formation. The reaction mechanisms for ethylene over-oxidation and partial oxidation are proposed. Our theoretical study unveiled a dynamic and unique means to achieve active site isolation that can be used to improve selectivity of hydrocarbon partial electro-oxidation.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			2155-5435			WOS:000716773800074

The ORR kinetics is slow. Developing cost-effective and highly efficient non-noble-metal catalysts to replace precious platinum-based electrocatalysts is a great challenge. The challenging issues associated with non-noble-metal catalysts are large-scale preparation, limited active sites, and low mass transfer efficiency. Here, a one-step, low-cost, and mass-producible method is presented for synthesizing porous carbon material doped with cobalt nanoparticles (NPs) and boron. This hybrid Co/B-C material is directly converted from boron phenolic resin (BPR) doped with Co3O4 NPs via a CO2 infrared laser. The resulting hybrid Co/B-C catalyst exhibits excellent ORR electrocatalytic performance with an onset potential of 0.893 V (vs. RHE) and a high current density of 4.71 mA cm(-2) in 0.1 M KOH solution.

The hydrogen production rates of the chemically oxidized Pt/g-C3N4 photo-catalysts (2471.7 and 3640.8 mu mol g(-1) h(-1)) were found to be at least 5 times higher than those of bulk Pt/g-C3N4 (429.3 and 728.8 mu mol g(-1) h(-1)). Compared with bulk g-C3N4, the chemically oxidized g-C3N4 was composed of more positively charged locales induced nearby the oxygen-containing edges, which was proven by DFT calculations. As a result, the chemically oxidized Pt/g-C3N4 catalysts maintained the high ratio of Pt2+/Pt-0 among the Pt nanoparticles during the Pt photodeposition. The higher proportion of Pt2+ sites on the chemically oxidized g-C3N4 enhanced the hydrogen evolution rate by their favorable water adsorption and hydrogen intermediates (Hads) desorption, thus suppressing the reversible reaction route of H-2 to 2H(+). Additionally, the chemically oxidized g-C3N4 with oxygen-containing functional groups improved the separation efficiency of photoexcited charges over Pt/g-C3N4.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			2168-0485			WOS:000715216700022

However, the photocatalytic activities of PCN-based materials remain moderate because of their poor dispersion in water and their fast electron-hole recombination. Here, a facile two-step continuous thermal treatment strategy is presented to endow the bulk PCN nanosheets with an atomically-thin structure, strong hydrophilicity and Lewis basicity to dramatically enhance the photocatalytic hydrogen (H-2) generation performance. The formation of the oxygen-containing and amino groups in the atomically-thin PCN sheets improves the charge separation and provides rich active sites for the surface reaction. Such synergistic effects lead to a superior visible-light-driven photocatalytic activity and its H-2 evolution rate (1233.5 mu mol h(-1)g(-1)) is more than 11 times higher than the bulk PCN using Ni as a cocatalyst. Additionally, the H-2 evolution rate can reach 20948.6 mu mol h(-1)g(-1) using Pt as a cocatalyst under AM1.5G solar irradiation.									231	13	0	0	25	0	232			1754-5692	1754-5706		WOS:000428187100001

The as-fabricated CP@Ni-P electrode exhibits excellent electrocatalytic performance toward hydrogen evolution in both acidic and alkaline solutions, with only small overpotentials of 162 and 250 mV, respectively, attaining a cathodic current density of 100 mA cm(-2). Furthermore, the CP@Ni-P electrode also exhibits superior catalytic performance toward oxygen evolution reaction (OER). An exceptionally high OER current of 50.4 mA cm(-2) is achieved at an overpotential of 0.3 V in 1.0 M KOH. The electrode can sustain 10 mA cm(-2) for 180 h with only negligible degradation, showing outstanding durability. Detailed microstructural and compositional studies reveal that upon OER in alkaline solution the surface Ni-P is transformed to NiO covered with a thin Ni(OH)(x) layer, forming a Ni-P/NiO/Ni(OH)(x) heterojunction, which presumably enhances the electrocatalytic performance for OER. Given the well-defi ned bifunctionality, a full alkaline electrolyzer is constructed using two identical CP@Ni-P electrodes as cathode and anode, respectively, which can realize overall water splitting with effi ciency as high as 91.0% at 10 mA cm(-2) for 100 h.									511	29	0	0	15	0	512			1616-301X	1616-3028		WOS:000379731500002

However, the surface chemistry of cobalt oxides and in particular the nature of the synergistic effect of gold contact are only understood on a rudimentary level, which at present prevents further exploration. We have synthesized a model system of flat, layered cobalt oxide nanoislands supported on a single crystal gold (111) substrate. By using a combination of atom-resolved scanning tunneling microscopy, X-ray photoelectron and absorption spectroscopies and density functional theory calculations, we provide a detailed analysis of the relationship between the atomic-scale structure of the nanoislands, Co oxidation states and substrate induced charge transfer effects in response to the synthesis oxygen pressure. We reveal that conversion from CO2+ to Co3+ can occur by a facile incorporation of oxygen at the interface between the nanoisland and gold, changing the islands from a Co-O bilayer to an O-Co-O trilayer. The O-Co-O trilayer islands have the structure of a single layer of beta-CoOOH, proposed to be the active phase for the OER, making this system a valuable model in understanding of the active sites for OER. The Co oxides adopt related island morphologies without significant structural reorganization, and our results directly demonstrate that nanosized Co oxide islands have a much higher structural flexibility than could be predicted from bulk properties. Furthermore, it is clear that the gold/nanoparticle interface has a profound effect on the structure of the nanoislands, suggesting a possible promotion mechanism.									68	2	0	0	4	0	69			1936-0851	1936-086X		WOS:000351791800021	25693621

The diffusion coefficient and the solubility of oxygen were ca. 10(-5) cm(2) s(-1) and ca. 10(-3) M (=mol dm(-3)), respectively. Those of hydrogen were a factor of 10 and one-tenth compared to oxygen, respectively. The permeability, which is a product of the diffusion coefficient and solubility, of oxygen and hydrogen were almost the same for the perfluoroethylenesulfuric acid membrane and the sulfuric acid solution; therefore, these values are suitable for fuel cell applications. On the other hand, a diffusion limiting current was observed for the hydrogen evolution reaction. The current corresponded to ca. 10(-10) mol cm(-1) s(-1) of the permeability, and the diffusion limiting species was the hydrogen carrier species. The TfOH addition enhanced the diffusion limiting current of [dema][TfO], and the H3PO4 addition eliminated the diffusion limit. The hydrogen bonds of H3PO4 or water-added H3PO4 might significantly enhance the transport of the hydrogen carrier species. Therefore, [dema][TfO] based materials are candidates for non-humidified mesothermal fuel cell electrolytes. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

Morphology analysis by TEM revealed the formation of metal nanoparticles of 2-3 nm size uniformly distributed over GNPs, while XPS was used to determine their oxidation states. Four materials were tested as electrocatalysts for ORR and OER in unitized regenerative fuel cells and rechargeable metal-air batteries. PtFe/GNPs exhibited favorable ORR kinetics in terms of the highest diffusion-limited current density, the lowest Tafel slope, and a high number of ex-changed electrons (n = 3.66), which might be attributed to its high double-layer capacitance and, thus, high electrochemically active surface area. Furthermore, this material performance was comparable to that of commercial Pt/C electrocatalyst containing double the amount of Pt. The same material showed the best performance toward OER as evidenced by the highest current density, the lowest value of exchange current density, and overpotential to reach a current density of 10 mA cm(-2), as well as the lowest Tafel slope.

The Goodenough-Kanamori rules explain the magnetic coupling between metals connected via ligands, known as super-(or double-) exchange interactions, which regulate their charge transport properties. To describe the electrocatalytic activity of magnetic metal oxides, we must extend their spin dependent mechanisms of electron tunnelling to catalytic interfaces, because the exchange coupling between orbitals, in the catalysts and with the chemisorbed reactants, influences the kinetics of electron transfer reactions. The principles for developing magnetic coupling rules in electrocatalysis must guarantee spin passages, which are optimum for intrinsically degenerate configurations of the frontier orbitals oriented in the direction of the bonds at both sides of the Fermi level. A continuous energy landscape between the reactants and the catalyst minimizes the overpotentials during coherent redox electron tunnelling. Consequently, in this paper we derive the guidelines of the ferromagnetic (FM) exchange interactions, an extension of the Goodenough-Kanamori rules, to electrocatalytic interfaces, which anticipates minimum Gibbs energy of activation. We focus on the electronic coordinates, targeting reaction conditions where the electrons are the main energy carriers to trigger the steps; nonetheless they are interrelated with the atomic movements. We will use the oxygen evolution and reduction reactions as examples where quantum exchange interactions, a landmark of solid-state magnetism, and the chemistry of the triplet state O-2 molecule, are crucial for optimum kinetics.One sentence summary: Delocalizing spin potentials facilitate the coherent propagation of electrons at covalent magnetic interfaces; this is a physical principle that links ferromagnetic exchange interactions, antibonding orbitals and optimum viable electrocatalysis: spintro-catalysis.

Understanding how this four-electron reaction works in detail is important for the development of improved robust catalysts made of Earth-abundant materials, like first-row transition-metal oxides. Here, using time-resolved Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy and under reaction conditions, we identify intermediates of water oxidation catalysed by an abundant metal-oxide catalyst, cobalt oxide (Co3O4). One intermediate is a surface superoxide (three-electron oxidation intermediate absorbing at 1,013 cm(-1)), whereas a second observed intermediate is attributed to an oxo Co(IV) site (one-electron oxidation intermediate absorbing at 840 cm(-1)). The temporal behaviour of the intermediates reveals that they belong to different catalytic sites. Knowledge of the structure and kinetics of surface intermediates will enable the design of improved metal-oxide materials for more efficient water oxidation catalysis.									561	11	0	0	85	0	563			1755-4330	1755-4349		WOS:000333396200028	24651205

As designed Ni(OH)(2)/NOSCF possesses strong electrostatic interactions with OH- ions due to many C=O groups existing in NOSCF, which can facilitate the formation of crucial NiOOH intermediates during the OER process. CeO2 nanoparticles (NPs) of similar to 3.3 nm in size are decorated on Ni(OH)2 nanosheets to design a highly efficient CeO2/Ni(OH)(2)/NOSCF electrocatalyst for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The CeO2 NP decorated Ni(OH) 2/NOSCF not only exhibits a remarkably improved OER performance with an onset potential of 240 mV, outperforming most reported non-noble metal based OER electrocatalysts, but also possesses a small Tafel slope of 57 mV dec(-1) and excellent stability under different overpotentials. The synergistic effect of producing more active species of Ni-III/IV and accelerating the charge transfer for Ni(OH)(2)/NOSCF by the introduction of CeO2 NPs is also investigated.

In present study, interconnected honeycomb-like NiCo2O4 nanoflakes are synthesized by facile electrochemical deposition on carbon cloth (CC) and subsequent heat treatment. Compared with NiO and Co3O4, suitably sized NiCo2O4 nanoflakes benefit from a vital synergistic effect of components Co and Ni and are expected to show superior OER/ORR performance. The presence of redox couples Co3+/Co2+ and Ni2+/Ni3+ and abundant oxygen vacancies in NiCo2O4 allow Li-O2 batteries deliver satisfactory cycle durability and high discharge/recharge capacities. Li-O2 batteries that use the NiCo2O4/CC cathodes exhibit high specific discharge capacities of 8388 mA h g-1 and 5238 mA h g-1 at 200 mA g-1 and 400 mA g-1, respectively, and deliver a long lifetime of 102 cycles with a capacity limit of 500 mA h g-1 at 340 mA g-1, thereby suggesting that honeycomb-like NiCo2O4 nanoflakes are a promising cathode catalyst.

We review herein, following the seminal contributions as reported by Jaganathan et al. (Functional genomics and evolution of photosynthetic systems, vol 33, advances in photosynthesis and respiration, Springer, Dordrecht, 2012), how these changes affected carriers and enzymes at the acceptor side of photosystem I (PSI): the electron shuttle ferredoxin (Fd), its isofunctional counterpart flavodoxin (Fld), their redox partner ferredoxin-NADP(+) reductase (FNR), and the primary PSI acceptors F (x) and F (A)/F (B). Protection of the [4Fe-4S] centers of these proteins from oxidative damage was achieved by strengthening binding between the F (A)/F (B) polypeptide and the reaction center core containing F (x), therefore impairing O-2 access to the clusters. Immobilization of F (A)/F (B) in the PSI complex led in turn to the recruitment of new soluble electron shuttles. This function was fulfilled by oxygen-insensitive [2Fe-2S] Fd, in which the reactive sulfide atoms of the cluster are shielded from solvent by the polypeptide backbone, and in some algae and cyanobacteria by Fld, which employs a flavin as prosthetic group and is tolerant to oxidants and iron limitation. Tight membrane binding of FNR allowed solid-state electron transfer from PSI bridged by Fd/Fld. Fine tuning of FNR catalytic mechanism led to formidable increases in turnover rates compared with FNRs acting in heterotrophic pathways, favoring Fd/Fld reduction instead of oxygen reduction.									25	1	0	0	19	0	27			0166-8595	1573-5079		WOS:000414992200002	28150152

Herein, we have adopted an in situ etching sulfurization method to construct a Zn2GeO4-x/ZnS intimate heterojunction, which exhibited excellent photocatalytic H-2 production in the absence of a Pt co-catalyst. Distinctively, TEM and HRTEM measurements showed that the interface of the Zn2GeO4-x/ZnS heterojunction became rough (topologically) due to in situ etching sulfurization, and etching was found to be strongly dependent on the crystal orientation. Moreover, the surface of the Zn2GeO4 nanorods from flat (100) planes evolved into an irregular coastline-like structure topologized with (110) and (113) high-index planes. ICP and elemental distribution measurements indicated that during the precipitation of ZnS via in situ etching sulfurization, the migration and dissolution of Zn and Ge ions on the Zn2GeO4(100) plane led to the roughening of the interface and the evolution of crystal planes. XPS and EPR analyses showed that Zn2GeO4-x/ZnS contained more oxygen vacancies with structural evolution. The theoretical calculations demonstrated that oxygen defects were prone to be generated on the Zn2GeO4(113) plane and formed the Ge-3c(3+)-V-O complexes. Compared to the inactive (100) plane, etching caused the Zn2GeO4(110) planes to have a higher number of threefold coordinated germanium (Ge-3c(4+)) and (113) high-index planes that possessed abundant active sites (Ge-3c(3+)-V-O complexes), which dramatically decreased the barrier and reaction energy of H2O dissociation. This work not only provides fundamental insights into the topological interface evolution and facet-dependent defect distribution but also offers a strategy for the design of efficient photocatalysts for H-2 production without the use of Pt as a co-catalyst based on a multifunctional interface.									7	2	0	0	0	0	7			1463-9076	1463-9084		WOS:000535921700033	32356549

The obtained PbCrO4 nanorods exhibit excellent stability and photocatalytic performance for O-2 evolution from water. The production rate is approximately 314.0 mu mol h(-1) g(-1) under visible light, and the quantum efficiency is approximately 2.16% at 420 +/- 10 nm and 0.05% at 600 +/- 10 nm. In addition, the PbCrO4 shows good degradation performance for methylene blue, methyl blue, methyl orange and phenol under visible-light irradiation. These results indicate that it is potential to fabricate an effective, robust PbCrO4 photocatalyst by transforming heavy-metal pollutants Pb(II) and Cr(VI) into a highly efficient O-2 evolution and photodegradation material. This strategy which uses pollutant to produce clean energy and degrade contaminants is completely green and environmentally benign, and thus could be a promising way for practical environmental applications.									7	1	0	0	2	0	7			2095-8226	2199-4501		WOS:000439332800003

The energy demand probably is the one contributing the most to such a situation, thus urging the development of clean and renewable alternative energy sources in order to avoid an imminent energy crisis in the near future. A possible solution is a society in which most energy needs are fulfilled by photoinduced or electrochemical water-splitting, storing solar energy as hydrogen and dioxygen gas, and releasing the chemical energy in fuel cells while regenerating water. However, the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and the oxygen reduction reaction taking place respectively in water-splitting and fuel cells are quite sluggish because of their multielectronic and multiprotonic nature. Catalysts such as IrO2 and RuO2 are being successfully used as state-of-the-art OER electrocatalysts but such noble metal-based materials are severely limited by their scarcity and high cost. Thus, noble metal free electro/photocatalysts are being eagerly pursued to provide more sustainable alternatives. In this context, vanadium-based and vanadium-containing electro and photocatalysts based on hydroxides/oxyhydroxides/oxides, vanadates, chalcogenides and nitrides stand out among the most promising alternatives, and recent advances have demonstrated their key role in enhancing the catalytic activity by strong synergic electronic and structural effects. In fact, such high-performance materials have potential in the fabrication of fuel cells and photosynthetic devices competitive enough in converting chemical energy into electricity and solar									65	1	0	0	3	1	65			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000521200000060

The X-ray pattern and elemental mapping proved that cobalt was successfully doped into zinc sites in the (Zn,Ni)(O,S) host lattice. We found the incorporation with a small amount of cobalt into (ZnNi)(O,S) enhanced its photo activity for hydrogen production. The best hydrogen production was achieved for 2.5% Co-(ZnNi)(O,S) with a rate of 8,527 mu mol/g.h during a span of 5 h in a 20% (v/v) ethanol/water solution. Based on the results of optical characterizations, the enhancement of hydrogen production was caused by the slow electron-hole recombination and the low charge transfer resistance. A different photocatalytic kinetic mechanism for hydrogen generation from the conventional one with the simultaneous formation of hydrogen and oxygen gases is proposed, based upon the activated surface oxygen anion to initiate or trigger the key reaction of oxidation for water splitting to proceed. Our strategy in preparing catalyst at low process temperature and in doping to activate catalyst is for weakening the lattice oxygen bonding on the catalyst surface in order to firstly initiate the oxidation reaction and the formation of oxygen vacancies. These freshly formed oxygen vacancies play a critical role to trap the water and weaken its O-H bonding to form hydrogen gas through the reduction reaction. (C) 2018 Energy Institute.

The O, S and N doped graphitic carbon was simultaneously deposited with ZnO on Ni foam substrate under hydrothermal deposition. One dimensional ZnO nanorods with flower-like graphitic carbon on their surface were obtained on the Ni foam substrate, which was directly used as photoelectrode to derive photoelectrochemical water splitting under solar light irradiation. The pristine ZnO@NF exhibit unattractive PEC performance evidenced by the high overpotential required for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) couple of water splitting reaction (398 mV vs. RHE). The carbon modified ZnO-C@NF photoelectrode lowers the overpotential required to 317 mV. This enhancement was attributed to the carbon modification which serves as both active site and photoelectron reservoir; facilitating the sluggish kinetics of OER couple reaction and promoting separation of photogenerated charge carriers.

Notably, bimetallic Fe/Ni-MOFs/NG nanocomposites as oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) catalysts have been for the first time investigated for cathodic materials in fuel cells. Interestingly, Fe/Ni-MOFs are not only as the ORB. catalyst itself, but also as the cocatalyst carriers with NG in our work. The Fe/Ni-MOFs/NG-20 exhibits excellent ORR performances with an onset potential of 1.09 V and a limiting current density of 8.56 mA cm(-2) at a rotation rate of 1600 rpm. The remaining relative current density after 12 000 s is kept at 93.69%. The Tafel slope value is 58.17 mV dec(-1). Thus, Fe/Ni-MOFs/NG-20 can be as a novel promising ORR catalyst for cathodes in fuel cells and metal-air batteries to solve the problems of sluggish reaction kinetics, low durability, and high costs.									18	1	0	0	0	0	18			0888-5885			WOS:000472683200010

Herein, we report a nitrogen-doped mesoporous carbon supported clustered CoOx composite catalyst (CoOx/NMC) synthesized from the anchored atomically dispersed CoOOH species by an efficient two-step nucleation method. Due to the synergistic and size effects, CoOx/NMC exhibits an enhanced bifunctional electrocatalytic performance in alkaline media than the state of the art commercial Pt/C catalyst for ORR and the OER catalyst (Ir/C). More importantly, the advanced CoOx/NMC catalyst enables recharge Zn-air batteries (ZABs) to achieve long-term cycling performance over 400 h by galvanostatic charge-discharge at current density of 10 mA cm(-2) with high efficiency, suggesting a very promising alternative to the conventional Pt/C and Ir/C catalysts for an air cathode.									38	1	0	0	0	0	38			2405-8297			WOS:000571725100016

To develop high-performance advanced electrocatalysts, porous perovskite La0.9Mn0.6Ni0.4O3-delta (LMN) nanofibers with in situ exsolved Ni nanoparticles have been synthesized by the electrospinning method, followed by reduction under a 5% H-2/Ar atmosphere. The results confirm that due to the numerous in situ exsolved Ni nanoparticles and oxygen vacancies formed on the surface of LMN nanofibers, the electronic conductivity, active site distribution, and O-2 adsorption of the cathode are dramatically improved. Furthermore, the Ni nanoparticles and oxygen vacancies generated on the surface of the LMN perovskite have enhanced the ORR/OER activities effectively. LOBs with the Ni-LMN cathode can deliver an impressive discharge capacity of 16 656 mAh g(-1) and long-term stability of about 95 cycles at a current density of 400 mA g(-1). These results reveal an exciting opportunity to develop a multifunctional perovskite for the high-performance LOBs.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			2574-0962			WOS:000586710300061

Herein, we report vertically aligned cobalt doped Ni-Fe based oxide (Co-NiO/Fe2O3) arrays as a robust OER electrocatalyst via a simple method combining hydrothermal reaction with heat treatment. Density functional theory calculation and XRD Rietveld refinement reveal that Co preferentially occupies the Ni sites compared to Fe in the Ni-Fe based oxides. The electronic structures of the Co-NiO/Fe2O3 could be further optimized, leading to the improvement of the intrinsic electronic conductivity and d-band center energy level and the decrease in the reaction energy barrier of the rate-determining step for the OER, thus accelerating its OER electrocatalytic activity. The Co-NiO/Fe2O3 nanosheet arrays display state-of-the-art OER activities at a large current density for industrial demands among Fe-Co-Ni based oxide electrocatalysts, which only require an ultra-low overpotential of 230 mV at a high current density of 500 mA cm(-2), and exhibit superb durability at 500 mA cm(-2) for at least 300 h without obvious degradation. The Co-NiO/Fe2O3 nanosheet arrays also have a small Tafel slope of 33.9 mV dec(-1), demonstrating fast reaction kinetics. This work affords a simple and effective method to design and construct transition metal oxide based electrocatalysts for efficient water oxidation.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2041-6520	2041-6539		WOS:000808114900001	35799815

The origin of the decreasing evolution rate for the photocatalytic splitting of water was investigated for the first time by directly monitoring the surface species on TiO2 during water photocatalysis with in situ attenuated total reflectance (ATR)-Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy. The in situ ATR-FTIR spectroscopic analysis during UV illumination of TiO2 immersed in water reveals that surface dioxygen and hydroxyl species are formed on TiO2: charged Ti-OOH-, peroxo Ti(O-2)(2-), and bridging Ti-(OH+)-Ti groups. The accumulation of these surface oxygenated species on the TiO2 photocatalyst blocks the activation of H2O on the surface titania sites and is responsible for the decreasing H-2 evolution rate and absence of O-2 evolution.

There has been a surge of diverse electrochemical systems which are to be scaled up from the lab-scale to industry sectors. To achieve the targets, the electrocatalysts are continuously upgraded to meet the required device efficiency at a low cost, increased lifetime and performance. An atomic scale understanding is however important for meeting the objectives. Transitioning from the bulk to the nanoscale regime of the electrocatalysts, the existence of defects and interfaces is almost inevitable, significantly impacting (augmenting) the material properties and the catalytic performance. The intrinsic defects alter the electronic structure of the nanostructured catalysts, thereby boosting the performance of metal-ion batteries, metal-air batteries, supercapacitors, fuel cells, water electrolyzers etc. This account presents our findings on the methods to introduce measured imperfections in the nanomaterials and the impact of these atomic-scale irregularities on the activity for three major reactions, oxygen evolution reaction (OER), oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Grain boundary (GB) modulation of the (ABO(3))(n) type perovskite oxide by noble metal doping is a propitious route to enhance the OER/ORR bifunctionality for zinc-air battery (ZAB). The perovskite oxides can be tuned by calcination at different temperatures to alter the oxygen vacancy, GB fraction and overall reactivity. The oxygen defects, unsaturated coordination environment and GBs can turn a relatively less active nanostructure into an efficient redox active catalyst by imbibing plenty of electrochemically active sites. Obviously, the crystalline GB interface is a prerequisite for effective electron flow, which is also applicable for the crystalline surface oxide shell on metal alloy core of the nanoparticles (NPs). The oxygen vacancy of two-dimensional (2D) perovskite oxide can be made reversible by the A-site termination of the nanosheets, facilitating the reversible entry and exit of a secondary phase during the redox processes. In several instances, the secondary phases have been observed to introduce the right proportion of structural defects and orbital occupancies for adsorption and desorption of reaction intermediates. Also, heterogeneous interfaces can be created by wrapping the perovskite oxide with negatively charged surface by layered double hydroxide (LDH) can promote the OER process. In another approach, ion intercalation at the 2D heterointerfaces steers the interlayer spacing that can influence the mass diffusion. Similar to anion vacancy, controlled formation of the cation vacancies can be achieved by exsolving the B-site cations of perovskite oxides to surface anchored catalytically active metal/alloy NPs. In case of the alloy electrocatalysts, incomplete solid solution by two or more mutually immiscible metals results in heterogeneous alloys having differently exposed facets with complementary functionalities. From the future perspective, new categories of defect structures including the 2D empty spaces or voids leading to undercoordinated sites, the multiple interfaces in heterogeneous alloys, antisite defects between anions and cations, and the defect induced inverse charge transfer should bring new dimensionalities to this riveting area of research.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			1527-8999	1528-0691		WOS:000807727300001	35675947

Herein, a high-efficiency one-pot method is developed to synthesize porous carbon with N, S doping and embedded hollow cobalt oxide nanoparticles. The coordination of polyethyleneimine molecules with cobalt ions enables the formation of organic-inorganic precursors via the co-precipitation with lignosulfonate because of the electrostatic interaction. Under thermal treatment, the hollow cobalt oxide nanoparticles can be well dispersed among the carbon matrix codoped with N, S. The as-prepared composite catalysts exhibit efficient bifunctional activity for electrochemical reduction and evolution reactions of oxygen, thanks to the N, S codoping nature and the hollow cobalt oxide with abundant oxygen vacancies. The bifunctional catalytic activity renders the assembly of high-performance Zn-air battery in an aqueous electrolyte with a specific capacity of 745 mA h g(zn)(-1) and good cycling stability for over 100 h.

Their performance can be significantly enhanced by incorporating metal oxides and tuning the electrochemical and surface characteristics by varying the coating composition. The present work focused on the preparation of Ni-P-TiO2-MnO2 coatings by an electroless method, for catalytic alkaline HER. At first TiO2 -MnO2 mixture oxide was prepared and its crystalline phase, elemental, bonding and morphological characteristics were analyzed by XRD, XPS, FT-IR and TEM. The TiO2-MnO2 mixture oxide incorporated Ni-P coatings were developed and their electrocatalytic activity was tuned by varying composition. The electrode with 11.32 at.% phosphorus and 14.42 at.% oxygen on the surface exhibited very high catalytic activity. The optimized Ni-P-TiO2-MnO2 electrode had significantly high activity and accomplished hydrogen evolution at high current densities (250 mA/cm(2)) with low overpotential (-142 mV) and low Tafel slope. The electrode had high double layer capacitance (1.29 x 10(-3) F). The proposed mechanism of HER on the Ni-P-TiO2-MnO2 electrode composed of Volmer hydrogen adsorption facilitated by Ni metal in the coating and H-2 evolution via Heyrovsky reaction.									14	2	0	0	0	0	16			1572-6657	1873-2569		WOS:000446283100015

Unfortunately, existing experimental techniques often require over-simplified models and theories that assume only one reaction path. In this work, however, it is proposed that water oxidation on hematite can proceed via mixed reaction paths according to spectroelectrochemical results without a priori assumptions. The true absorption signals of surface states responsible for water oxidation are isolated from subsidiary signals for undoped and Ti-doped hematite and contrasted with those of inactive species. The evolution of absorption signals as a function of applied potential and illumination intensity highlights the non-negligible contribution of direct hole transfer, especially for highly doped hematite.									4	0	0	0	1	0	4			2366-9608			WOS:000714808000001	34928039

However, the systematic investigation of the morphology-dependent superaerophobicity and the resulted electrocatalytic performance has been less developed. We herein reported a facile in situ chalcogel method to modulate CoMoSx supported on the nickel foam (NF) with three distinct geometries through varying the synthesis time. The morphologies of supported CoMoSx on NF featuring with different roughness were related to the underwater superaerophobicity. Accordingly, the electrocatalytic performance and the size of the gas bubbles released from the surface varied with the morphology evolution. Furthermore, as bifunctional electrocatalysts, the optimal CoMoSx/NF-1h with hierarchical nanostructure could sustain an extremely high current density of 500 mA/cm2 for overall water splitting at 1.89 V. The current results offered an insight for further engineering superaerophobic electrocatalysts in a practical manner.									7	0	0	0	0	0	7			0927-7757	1873-4359		WOS:000663628400005

The proposed model is based on a nonequilibrium thermodynamics approach previously developed by us, describing the transient response to current perturbations of an electrochemical double layer at the catalyst/Nafion-electrolyte interface. It describes the internal dynamics of the electrochemical double layer, taking into account the coupling between the transport of protons and Pt2+ in the diffuse layer, as well as the carbon-supported Pt coarsening, the Pt oxidation, the oxygen reduction reaction, and the water dipoles adsorption in the inner layer. This continuous nanoscale interfacial model is coupled with a microscale model of the oxygen transport through the impregnated Nafion layer and is designed to be coupled with a continuous microscale model of electron, proton, and Pt2+ transports through the membrane-cathode assembly thickness. The model allows analysis of cathodic potential sensitivity to the operating conditions, the initial Pt loading, and to the temporal evolution of the electrochemical activity from aging mechanisms. In particular, the influence of simulated time on the impedance spectra pattern is studied. (C) 2007 The Electrochemical Society.									74	0	0	0	0	0	74			0013-4651	1945-7111		WOS:000246892000033

While the results of electrochemical testings show that composition can improve the properties, the ratio of hybrids can effect the catalytic performances. And when the x is 25% (MoS2/CoSe2-25), the hybrid shows the best catalytic performances towards hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), with a low overpotential of 113 mV at 10 mA/cm(2), the smaller Tafel slope (45 mV/dec), and kinetic resistance (23 Omega), and the current density can be maintained for at least 24 h. Thus, MoS2/CoSe2-25 shows potential application in water splitting.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0947-7047	1862-0760		WOS:000725408300002

After preoxidizing the powder and deoxidation, the apparent density of a Fe-WC-Mo2C-Cr3C2-VC-C alloy and the evolution of internal pores in its structure were determined during the exhaust process. The results show that the gas produced by deoxidation significantly affected the densification process, the pre-sintered sample exhibit expansion and then shrinkage. After holding at 1040 degrees C, the volume of sample is 1.75% larger than that of the green compact with the lowest density. After sintering at 1220 degrees C, the volume decreased by 15.27%. The reaction gas gradually moves from the inside to the outside of the sample, and the direction of densification extend from the center of the sample to its edges. After carbothermal reaction, the oxygen content is reduced from 0.35 wt.%-1.05 wt.% to below 10 ppm. The amount of oxygen removed is positively and linearly correlate with the amount of carbon consumed. (c) 2022 The Author(s).

The CoZn/NC-Ti3C2 catalyst presents considerable kinetics with a half-wave potential (E-1/2) of 0.847 V, and the fuel cell peak power density reaches 245 mW cm(-2). Furthermore, this catalyst exhibits an excellent stability with only 4.83% drop of relative current after 30000 s of testing.

It is often difficult to measure and compare the activities of oxide catalysts on either per mass or per surface area basis, because of the poorly defined oxygen transport to and within porous oxide electrodes of several tens of micrometers thickness. In this study, a methodology was developed to compare the ORR activities of submicrometer-sized transition-metal oxides. Thin films of LaNiO3, LaCu0.5Mn0.5O3, and La0.75Ca0.25FeO3 oxide particles were bonded to glassy carbon via an ion-exchanged Nafion binder, and their mass and specific ORR activities were extracted from rotating disk electrode measurements. We found that the specific activity of LaNiO3 was much higher than that of La0.75Ca0.25FeO3 and LaCu0.5Mn0.5O3. The projection of LaNiO3 in the actual fuel cell cathode was presented, which was shown to be competitive with current platinum-based cathodes. (C) 2010 The Electrochemical Society.

However the relative importance of these two channels is generally poorly constrained for oxidized organics. Here we determine fragmentation-functionalization branching ratios for organics spanning a range of oxidation levels, using the heterogeneous oxidation of squalane (C30H62) as a model system. Squalane particles are exposed to high concentrations of OH in a flow reactor, and measurements of particle mass and elemental ratios enable the determination of absolute elemental composition (number of oxygen, carbon, and hydrogen atoms) of the oxidized particles. At low OH exposure, the oxygen content of the organics increases, indicating that functionalization dominates, whereas for more oxidized organics the amount of carbon in the particles decreases, indicating the increasing importance of fragmentation processes. Once the organics are moderately oxidized (O/C approximate to 0.4), fragmentation completely dominates, and the increase in O/C ratio upon further oxidation is due to the loss of carbon rather than the addition of oxygen. These results suggest that fragmentation reactions may be key steps in the formation and evolution of oxygenated organic aerosol (OOA).									216	4	0	0	51	0	218			1463-9076	1463-9084		WOS:000269548300026	19727507

The complex and changeful geographical conditions in high altitude area make the new migrations of human or animals affected by Mountain Sickness. The oxidative stress reaction induced by low of atmospheric and oxygen pressure and strong sun radiation is one of main causes of Mountain Sickness. In this paper, the relationships between different environmental factors in high altitude area and free radical reactions has been discussed in 6 areas. First, the results show that free radical reaction have significant negative relationship with atmospheric air pressure and oxygen pressure. Second, the native people in plateau can also be affected by free radical reaction as well as the new comer. Third, the native people in plateau can get an inherit adaptability. Forth, the inner nutrition materials can resist free radical reaction. Fifth, people exposure to high UV radiation would be easily affected by free radical reaction. Sixth, Low selenium and iodine in environment is also risk factors for people affected by free radical reaction. This study is not only of an im- portant significance in understanding the free radical reactions induced by environment stress as well as the origin and evolution of native people, but also is practically valuable for studying the Mountain Sickness of crowds immigrating to high altitude areas as well as the sickness prevention and treatment. In addition, this study is valuable for the economic development and national defense construction in high altitude area. This study may provide valuable references for studying the regulatory effects of environmental factors on Mountain Sickness and their physiology in the Western Development of China.			高原环境足一个特殊的生态环境系统．其复杂多变的自然地理条件使移居和新进高原环境的人群或生物出现高原反应或发生高原（山）病。大气压低、氧分压低、太阳辐射强所导致的氧化应激反应是高原反府或高原病的主要原凶之一。本义从高原气候因素与方由基反应．不同海拔高度对不同民族人群自由基反应的影响．相同海拔高度不同人群的自由基反应，海拔高度与机体抗氧化营养物质变化的关系．不同海拔高度紫外线强度与自由基反应及高原环境地球化学异常与自由基反应等6个方面．沧述了高原环境因素与不同人群自由摹反应的关系．不仅对探讨环境应激反应所产生的自由基反应与世居高原地区人群起源和进化有重要意义。而且对研究移居人群高原反应和高原病的预防、治疗及经济、国防建设具有现实应用价值。						2	6	0	0	1	0	7			1007-6301			CSCD:2307808

Herein, microwave/ultrasound assisted hydrothermal procedures were developed to synthesize Ce-doped LaCoO3 perovskite oxide as bifunctional electrocatalysts for OER and HER application, achieving highly efficient bifunctional catalytic performance. The obtained LCC4 exhibited excellent electrocatalytic activity with an overpotential of 380 mV and 305 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) toward OER and HER, respectively. The lower Tafel slopes of 80 mV per decade and 144 mV per decade for OER and HER, respectively, indicated the faster reaction kinetics for the improved inherent electrocatalytic activity. The outstanding long-term durability of LCC4 in alkaline conditions was also vital to the practical applications of water electrolysis. The improved bifunctional electrocatalytic activity was attributed to the synergistic effects of excellent conductivity and enriched active sites arising from A-site substitution. This work not only provides an efficient strategy for the development of perovskite oxide-based electrocatalysts but also puts forward a new insight on bifunctional electrocatalysts for overall water splitting.									14	0	0	0	1	0	12			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000656563100001	34076006

While ion electrosorption via capacitive deionization is only suitable for brackish water with low molar strength, the use of Faradaic materials capable of reversible ion intercalation or conversion reactions allows energy-efficient removal of ions from seawater. However, the limited charge transfer/storage capacity of Faradaic materials indicates an upper limit for their desalination applications. Therefore, a new electrochemical concept must be explored to exceed the current state-of-the-art results and to push the desalination capacity beyond 100-200 mg(NaCl)/g(electrode). In this proof-of-concept work, we introduce the new concept of using metal-air battery technology for desalination. We do so by presenting performance data for zinc-air desalination (ZAD) in 600 mM NaCl. The ZAD cell provides a desalination capacity of 0.9-1.0 mg(NaCl)/cm(2) (normalized to the membrane area; corresponding to 1300 mg(NaCl)/g(Zn)) with a charge efficiency of 70% when charging/discharging the cell at 1 mA/cm(2). The energy consumption of ZAD is 68-92 kJ/mol.									23	0	0	0	3	0	23			1388-2481	1873-1902		WOS:000536516500010

The Fe3N/N-GA obtained at the pyrolysis temperature of 900 degrees C, denoted as Fe3N/N-GA-900, exhibits outstanding catalytic activity towards the ORR compared to other Fe3N/N-GA hybrids, which may be due to the highest absolute content of Fe-N and graphitic-N species in the Fe3N/N-GA-900. Remarkably, the fabricated Fe3N/N-GA-900 hybrid is comparable to the benchmark Pt/C catalyst in terms of the onset potential and half-wave potential, but it possesses a larger kinetic energy, which limits the current density, and better methanol tolerance and operational stability than those of the commercial Pt/C catalyst for the ORR in an alkaline medium. Therefore, it holds great promise as a replacement for the Pt/C catalyst in alkaline direct methanol fuel cells (DMFCs).									22	0	0	0	0	0	22			1144-0546	1369-9261		WOS:000395092600041

In this study, we replaced the traditional aqueous electrolyte with AlCl3-urea ionic liquid electrolyte, and prepared Co-MnO2/C catalysts as cathode catalyst. Structures and electrocatalytic activity of the x % Co-MnO2/C (x is the mole percent of Co to Mn, x = 0, 10, 20, 30, 40 and 50) catalysts have been investigated systematically. After Co ions intercalation, the specific surface area of the catalyst increased and average pore diameter decreased. The unique interaction between Co ions and MnO2 led to an increase in the catalytic activity of the catalyst in the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) compared with MnO2/C. In particular, 40% Co-MnO2/C showed the largest specific surface area (154.25 m(2) g(-1)) and the smallest average pore diameter (6.47 nm). It showed the most positive half-wave potential (0.727 V vs. RHE) and the biggest limiting current density (4.744 mA cm(-2)) in ORR process, and also exhibited the lowest onset potential (1.593 V) and the biggest limit current density (15.177 mA cm(-2)) in OER process. Furthermore, aluminum-air battery assembled with 40% Co-MnO2/C demonstrated excellent reversible charge and discharge performance, which had an average discharge voltage of 1.5 V and an average charge voltage of 2 V during 30 cycles at a limited battery capacity of 375 mAh g(-1). Our results reveal the possibility of designing a rechargeable aluminum-air battery working at ambient conditions based on the Co-MnO2/C air cathode catalyst for the first time. Our work opens up a new way to achieve the rechargeability of aluminum-air batteries, and our highly active electrocatalytic materials can be used in a wider range of electrochemical energy applications.

Thus, a cost-effective, scalable and metal-free electrocatalyst was developed for use in oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) at fuel cell cathodes. The physicochemical properties of the activated carbons have been analyzed by elemental analysis, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, and nitrogen adsorption. The ORR electrocatalytic performances of the activated carbons have been investigated by cyclic voltammetry and linear sweep voltammetry in an alkaline electrolyte. The results showed that phosphorus-containing groups are key to endowing phosphoric-acid-activated carbons with comparable electrocatalytic activity to that of commercial Pt/C. This was because these phosphorus-containing groups facilitated the formation of both nitrogen-containing groups and defects in the microstructure. Besides, heat treatment of phosphoric-acid-activated carbons in ammonia produced a highly developed mesopore structure and thus kinetically facilitated the ORR.

As a result, the electron transfer and Hydrogen Evolution Reaction (HER) performance are enhanced.

Both the reactions are important in the respective fields, viz., H2O2 production as well as fuel cell technology, and rational design of catalysts is mandatory to acquire high energy efficiency in both cases. Here, we report the structure-electrochemical property correlation of a series of perovskite related brownmillerite compounds, Ba2In0.75M0.25O5 (M=Mn/Fe/Co/Ni/Cu), synthesized by solid-state method. On transition metal doping, octahedral distortions were observed, and the highly disordered material tends to follow the 4e transfer mechanism. More symmetrical structures followed the 2e pathway to form H2O2 as the product with high peroxide selectivity. The distortion in the octahedral arrangement can be a descriptor to finetune the selectivity of the catalysts towards the 2e and 4e pathways of ORR.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2196-0216			WOS:000747395000016

It has been shown that the formation of HxMnO2 center dot nH(2)O nanocrystals with a morphology of nanosheets and a birnessite-like crystal structure with a thickness of 5-8 nm is observed on the surface of drops. These nanocrystals are oriented spontaneously to the solution-gas interface and constitute peculiar ribbons with a width of 1-2 mu m, some of which form ordered honeycomb structures (OHS) with a 5-20 mu m cell size. To explain the observed effect, the scheme of chemical reactions that take place at the interface between the surface of a drop and ozone has been modeled, and it can be described using a diffusion pattern model taking into account the action of "force fields" on the surface of a drop, which arise due to its curvature. After the drop is dried, these structures practically retain their morphology and form a fractal structure with a geometric area equal to the area of the drop base on the surface of the substrate. The study of the electrocatalytic properties of these structures revealed that they are active electrocatalysts in the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) during water electrolysis in alkaline medium. The most efficient of the obtained electrocatalysts are characterized by an overpotential value of 284 mV at a current of 10 mA/cm(2) and the Tafel coefficient of 37.7 mV/dec and are currently one of the best among pure manganese oxides. Finally, it has also been assumed that this effect is explained by the morphological features of the structures obtained, which contribute to the removal of oxygen bubbles from the electrode surface during electrolysis.									3	0	0	0	1	0	3			2470-1343			WOS:000504635000063	31891103

Hereby, Trimetallic organic frameworks (TriMOF) consisting of Fe, Co, and Zn synergized on the surface of activated carbon (AC) from pineapple leaves tend to show exponential catalytic activity due to the more excellent ionic conductivity, catalytic stability and multiple active sites provided by different metal precursors. Furthermore, the developed nanocomposite was coated on the stainless-steel electrode substrate at room temperature, delivering greater electrocatalytic surface area and numerous active sites. The oxidation reaction kinetics drives the catalytic reduction of 4-nitrophenol to 4-aminophenol with a minimal time of 12 min @ >97 % efficiency. Furthermore, on electrocatalytic oxidation of water splitting process due to the presence of multiple metallic, active sites, the overpotential is at 370 mV having Tafel slope of 40 mV/dec and electrochemically active surface area of is 9.9 mF/cm(2). This superior catalytic reduction of 4-nitrophenol and electrocatalytic water oxidation process is attributed to the developed composite's active centre and conductivity.									2	0	0	0	1	0	2			0045-6535	1879-1298		WOS:000705603400004	34403903

Pt has been widely used as the optimal cocatalyst in photocatalytic water splitting. However, it still has an obvious drawback that the H-2 evolution rate shows an obvious decrease for overall water splitting after a certain reaction time due to the back reaction between H-2 and O-2 to produce water. To date, the mechanism of the back reaction under solar-light irradiation is still unclear, and the method of preventing the back reaction has been rarely researched in recent years. Herein, a hybrid Pt/Cu1-x/TiO2 catalyst was prepared via an in situ photodeposition method. Compared to Pt/TiO2, the as-prepared Pt/CuO1-x/TiO2 showed enhanced photocatalytic activity and stability in the water-splitting reaction. Characterization results revealed that CuO1-x clusters are highly dispersed on the exposed TiO2 surface, and Pt particles are mainly deposited upon the CuO1-x clusters. The electrochemical hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) tests and transient photocurrent responses manifested the fast and efficient transfer of e(-) from CuO1-x, to Pt. It was found that O-2(-) plays an important role for the reverse reaction of photocatalytic water splitting. The CuO1-x clusters in the Pt/CuO1-x/TiO2 catalyst restrain the back reaction of water splitting due to the decreased formation of O-2- on the surface of TiO2 (like the Ying character in Taoism). In addition, the fast transfer of e(-) from TiO2 to CuO1-x and Pt particles accordingly improves the photocatalytic activity (like the Yang character in Taoism). These two characters of CuO1-x synergistically improve the photocatalytic activity and stability during the overall water-splitting process. This study reveals the mechanism on the back reaction of water splitting over Pt/TiO2 under solar-light irradiation and provides an innovative and practical way to efficiently enhance the photocatalytic activity and prevent the back reaction of water splitting.									12	0	0	0	0	0	12			2168-0485			WOS:000452344900150

A strong entrance channel dependence favoring breakup into the entrance channel with large excitation energy has been seen for O-16+Y-89 system, but not for C-12+Nb-93 system. In the case of O-16+Nb-93 reaction also, unexpectedly, large back-angle oxygen yield has been seen.

J	Chen, Hungru; Islam, M. Saiful								Lithium Extraction Mechanism in Li-Rich Li2MnO3 Involving Oxygen Hole Formation and Dimerization								CHEMISTRY OF MATERIALS				28	18			6656	6663		10.1021/acs.chemmater.6b02870				SEP 27 2016	2016	Lithium-rich oxide electrodes with layered structures have attracted considerable interest because they can deliver high energy densities for lithium-ion batteries. However, there is significant debate regarding their redox chemistry. It is apparent that the mechanism of lithium extraction from lithium-rich Li2MnO3 is not fully understood, especially in relation to the observed O-2 evolution and structural transformation. Here, delithiation and kinetic processes in Li2MnO3 are investigated using ab initio simulation techniques employing high level hybrid functionals as they reproduce accurately the electronic structure of oxygen hole states. We show that Li extraction is charge-compensated by oxidation of the oxide anion, so that the overall delithiation reaction involves lattice oxygen loss. Localized holes on oxygen (O-) are formed as the first step but are not stable leading to oxygen dimerization (with O-O similar to 1.3 angstrom) and eventually to the formation of molecular O-2. Oxygen dimerization facilitates Mn migration onto octahedral sites in the vacated lithium layers. The results suggest that reversible oxygen redox without major structural changes is only possible if the localized oxygen holes are stabilized and oxygen dimerization suppressed. Such an understanding is important for the future optimization of new lithium-rich cathode materials for high energy density batteries.									169	7	0	0	11	0	173			0897-4756	1520-5002		WOS:000384399000031

It also presents an overview of the field over the last decade, including some historical perspective of the Heck-Matsuda (HM) reaction with general considerations regarding reaction conditions, type of catalysts used, and the application of arenediazonium salts as reagents for the HM arylation of several types of alkenes. Throughout this review, the principal aspects related to reactivity and selectivity are discussed, and when applicable a comparison is made between the HM and the conventional Heck reactions. One-pot procedures that involve generation of the arenediazonium salt in situ from the corresponding aniline have been presented as well as some useful heterogeneous catalytic protocols. Allylic alcohols, conjugated alkenes, unsaturated heterocycles, and unactivated alkenes are capable of being arylated with arenediazonium salts by using simple catalysts such as Pd(OAc)(2) or Pd-2(dba)(3) at room temperature in air and in benign and conventional solvents. In addition to the intramolecular variant of the HM reaction, intermolecular tandem coupling-cyclization processes have also been developed for the construction of a range of oxygen and nitrogen heterocycles. Finally, several applications towards the total synthesis of biologically active natural and nonnatural compounds are highlighted as well as the use of the HM reaction in the synthesis of new chiral, nonracemic ligands.									257	3	0	0	68	4	257			1434-193X	1099-0690		WOS:000288129100001

X-ray diffraction for ternary catalysts reveal co-deposited phases consisting of a tetragonal crystalline structure (P4(2)/mnm) for RuO2, and two phases corresponding to monoclinic (P2/m) and tetragonal (P4(2)/mnm) crystalline structures for ZrO2. SEM micrographs show that ZrO2 alters grain growth and film morphology as its content is increased. Electrochemical tests performed in 1 mol L-1 H2SO4 and 0.1 mol L-1 NaCl demonstrate that the kinetic rate to perform the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) decreases with the simultaneous augment of ZrO2 and Sb2O5 compositions in the ternary anode, while in the ZrO2 absence, Sb2O5 catalyzes the OER (Ti/SbRu) compared to the Ti/Ru and ternary electrodes. Although the chlorine evolution reaction (CER) preferentially occurs by the suppression of OER in chloride media, the CER rate mainly increases due to the rise of the ZrO2 content. This finding is corroborated with an iodometric method using UV-Vis spectroscopy, which shows that the electro-generation capacity to form active chlorine species is significantly enhanced when ZrO2 is added, compared to Ti/RuO2 and Sb2O5 doped Ti/RuO2 materials. Accelerated life tests conducted with all catalysts indicate that all ternary anodes present failure times considerably longer than Ti/Ru, Ti/SbRu and Ti/RuZr electrodes, suggesting a stability enhancement due to the combined presence of Sb and Zr species.

However, the development of high performance catalysts for efficient and stable liquid-phase hydrogen generation remains a major challenge for the widespread use of hydrogen energy. Here, Ag supported on ferromagnetic MgFe2O4 nanoparticles (Ag/MgFe2O4) was employed as an efficient, stable, and magnetoswitchable catalyst for the conversion of formaldehyde solution into H-2 using O-2 as a cocatalyst at room temperature. It was found that the adsorption and activation of O-2 on the Ag surface can be enhanced by the abundant surface oxygen vacancies on MgFe2O4 support and the electron transfer between MgFe2O4 and Ag, leading to the generation of the main active species OOH radicals and the subsequent cleavage of C-H bonds in HCHO to realize hydrogen evolution. Meanwhile, magnetic control experiments are designed to switch the catalytic reactions between "on" and "off" states, resulting in the effective recovery and reuse of the catalysts. The present research introduces a new means to create a magnetoswitchable catalytic system for scalable hydrogen energy applications.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			2044-4753	2044-4761		WOS:000698147800001

For practical application, the HER catalysts can work in low alkaline or neutral reaction systems. However, in these reaction systems, water dissociation into proton is a rate-determining step, which can be overcome by loading metal oxide or hydroxides onto the HER catalysts. Ni(OH)(2) is a well-reported cocatalyst to assist water dissociation. Herein, NiB@Ni(OH)(2) [Ni-B with loaded Ni(OH)(2)] as a HER catalyst at weak alkalinity has been investigated. Very interestingly, we find that when borate is added into the above reaction systems, the resultant catalyst Ni-B@Ni (OH)(2)-BI shows much better HER activity and stability than Ni-B@Ni(OH)(2). The reason is that borate ions can intercalate into Ni(OH)(2) interlayers, which increases proton transport ability and stability of Ni(OH)(2) loaded on Ni-B. These findings provide new insights for design new composite catalysts of HER in low alkaline reaction systems.									51	2	0	0	0	0	51			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000551901000037

A HPCM with an ultrahigh specific surface area of 1141.41 m(2) g(-1) and a highly interconnected macroporous network was produced, in which the active sites are exactly located on the mass-transport channels. By adjusting the precursor's solidification rates, the porosity of HPCMs can be exactly tuned from the micrometer to the nanometer level. Such an excellent structure, by benefiting the fast mass transport and maximizing the utilization of active sites, leads to an excellent ORR performance with a half-wave potential of 0.901 V which exceeds that of the state-of-the-art Pt/C catalyst by 40 mV.									33	3	0	0	0	0	34			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000422949700018

An electrocatalyst with decent HER and OER activities in the same electrolyte is crucial for sustainable energy storage and conversion device. In this work, a nitrogen-doped porous carbon confined yolk/shell OWS catalyst of WC/Co3W3N/Co@NC has been prepared via calcination polyhedron encapsulation structure PW12 @ZIF-8 @ZIF-67 generated by the epitaxial method. Because of the optimized chemical composition, the derived WC/Co3W3N/Co@NC multisite catalyst has outstanding OWS performance in 1 M KOH solution. For example, to reach a current density of 10 mA cm(-2), it only needs low overpotentials of 141 and 280 mV for the HER and OER, respectively. By using the easy operation and classical bubble extraction method, we find that the Faraday efficiencies of the catalyst for HER and OER are 94.3% and 97.4%, respectively. Moreover, taking advantage of the micropores and mesopores in the yolk/shell structure, it exhibits enhanced stability and promoted diffusion kinetics. This work initiates an effortless approach to the synthesis of the highly efficient yolk/shell carbon-based OWS electrocatalyst.

Herein, a metal-organic framework (Ni-MOF) as cocatalyst has been introduced onto Fe2O3 nanoarrays for PEC water oxidation. The new Ni-MOFs/Fe2O3 photoanode obviously improves the PEC water oxidation performance with respect to the Fe2O3. Specifically, a high photocurrent density is achieved on the Ni-MOF/Fe2O3 film, which corresponds to two-fold over the pristine Fe2O3 film at 1.23 V vs. RHE. Moreover, the photoanode also exhibits a significant cathodic shift of the onset potential (similar to 240 mV) relative to the bare Fe2O3.

MOF 1 and MOF 2 with open Cu-II sites, resulting the framework 1 and 2 show electrocatalytic activity for water oxidation in alkaline solution. The electrochemical properties of complex for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) were evaluated by linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) and the Tafel slopes. Complex 1 has a higher LSV activity with a lower over potential of 1.54 V and a much higher increase in current density. Meanwhile, the Tafel slope of complex 1 (122.0 mV dec(-1)) is much lower than complex 2 (243.5 mV dec(-1)). This phenomenon makes complex 1 a promising porous material for electrocatalytic activity.

It represents a key for a better understanding of the complex structural evolutions pointed out in the materials like Li(Li,Ni,Mn,CO)O-2 when they are used as positive electrode materials in lithium-ion batteries. Li2MnO3 samples were prepared either via coprecipitation or via a two step solid state reaction followed by different annealing treatments. Using X-ray and electron diffraction in combination with diffraction data simulations, we show that in function of the synthesis conditions, Li2MnO3 is obtained with various degrees of disorder, along the c monoclinic direction, in the stacking of the ordered Li1/3Mn2/3 sheets within the cfc oxygen packing. We show that this disorder decreases when the synthesis temperature increases but the synthesis of a material free of stacking faults is not possible with these synthesis routes. Finally, the similarities between the evolutions pointed out in Li2MnO3 due to the synthesis conditions and those previously observed in the materials like Li(Li,Ni,Mn,Co)O-2 related to the evolution of the cations distribution in the slabs are underlined.

The catalytic performance of SACs largely depends on the structure of their active sites, but explorations of highly active structures for SAC active sites are still limited. Herein, we demonstrate a combined experimental and theoretical study of oxygen reduction catalysis on SACs, which incorporate M-N(3)C(1)site structure, composed of atomically dispersed transition metals (e.g., Fe, Co, and Cu) in nitrogenated carbon nanosheets. The resulting SACs with M-N(3)C(1)sites exhibited prominent oxygen reduction catalytic activities in both acidic and alkaline media, following the trend Fe-N3C1> Co-N3C1> Cu-N3C1. Theoretical calculations suggest the C atoms in these structures behave as collaborative adsorption sites to M atoms, thanks to interactions between thed/porbitals of the M/C atoms in the M-N(3)C(1)sites, enabling dual site oxygen reduction.									34	0	0	0	0	0	34			1433-7851	1521-3773		WOS:000581047000001	32959493

Enhanced OER performance of NiFeB amorphous alloys by surface self-reconstruction								International Journal of Hydrogen Energy				47	48			20718	20728		10.1016/j.ijhydene.2022.04.200				2022	2022	The design and development of cost-effective and highly efficient oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrocatalysts are urgently desirable during the water-splitting process. Here, NixFe80-xB20 (x = 70, 60, 50, 40, 30, hereafter referred to as NFB) amorphous alloys, with high mechanical strength, excellent corrosion resistance, and unique atomic structure, are fabricated as efficient water oxidation electrocatalysts in alkaline solutions. Ni40Fe40B20 amorphous ribbons achieve only 319 mV of overpotential at 10 mA.cm-2 with a Tafel slope of 56 mV dec-1 and exhibit excellent long-term stability for 24 h at 10 mA.cm-2 and 100 mA.cm-2 in 1 M KOH solution, which outperform the commercial RuO2 electrocatalyst. It is worth noting that the OER performance of NixFe80-xB20 amorphous electrocatalysts after long-term chronopotentiometry test displays more effectively, which can be ascribed to the surface construction. Meanwhile, the analysis of the morphology and structure of the electrocatalysts reveal that continuous oxidation during the OER process induces the structural reorganization on the surface of the electrocatalysts, which can enhance the electron transfer process and adsorption of the reaction intermediates to optimize the OER performance. This study provides a shred of evidence for surface self-reconstruction of NiFeB amorphous alloys electrocatalysts during the OER process and promotes the application of amorphous alloys as functional materials in the water-splitting field.

However, strong deactivation can be observed after preconditioning of the material in the reaction solvent 2-butanol. Surface changes caused by the pretreatment have been studied by XPS. The comparison of the pristine sample and the pretreated carbon sample showed similar distribution of oxygen functional groups by ex-situ XPS, as well as similar behavior during heating in vacuum. However, the addition of water (0.1 mbar vapor pressure) and subsequent heating to 130 degrees C exhibited prominent differences in the evolution of the O1s, as well as for the C1s spectra of the two samples. Changes in the surface termination and hydrophobicity of the materials are discussed under the aspect of possible reactions of surface functional groups with the alcoholic solvent and water.

Hence, designing a robust multifunctional electrocatalyst is desirable for widespread implementation of this waste to fuel technology. In this context, here, we report a simple tuning of the electrocatalytically favorable characteristics of NiCo-layered double hydroxide by introducing [MoS4]2- in its interlayer space. The [MoS4]' insertion as well as its effect on the electronic structure tuning is thoroughly studied via X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy in combination with electrochemical analysis. This insertion induces overall electronic structure tuning of the hydroxide layer in such a way that the designed catalyst exhibited favorable kinetics toward all the required reactions of hydrogen generation. This is why our homemade catalyst, when utilized both as a cathode and anode to fabricate a urea electrolyzer, required a mere X1.37 V cell potential to generate sufficient H2 by reaching the benchmark 10 mA cm-2 in 1 M KOH/0.33 M urea along with long-lasting catalytic efficiency. Other indispensable reason of selecting [MoS4]2- is its high-valent nature making the catalyst highly selective and insensitive to common catalyst-poisoning toxins of urine. This is experimentally supported by performing the real urine electrolysis, where the nanospike-covered Ni foam-based catalyst showed a performance similar to that of synthetic urea, offering its industrial value. Other intuition of selecting [MoS4]2- was to provide a ligand-based mechanism for hydrogen evolution half-cell [hydrogen evolution reaction (HER)] to preclude the HER-competing oxygen reduction. Another crucial point of our work is its potential to avoid the mixing of two explosive product gases, that is, H2 and O-2.									9	0	0	0	0	0	9			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000477787200030	31243949

As a result of the synergistic effect from the 3D porous structure, enhanced conductivity, and the two active components Ni2+ and P delta- with rich valences, the resulting vertically aligned NiPx nanoflakes grown on the CF (CF@NiPx) electrode exhibit superior bifunctional electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) performance in an alkaline electrolyte as well as an ultrahigh specific volumetric capacitance of 817 F cm(-3) at a current density of 2 mA cm(-2). For practical applications, an efficient CF@NiPx-based alkaline water electrolyzer, with strong durability, can achieve 10 mA cm(-2) water-splitting current at a cell voltage of only 1.61 V (iR uncorrected). Besides, a fiber-based flexible solid-state asymmetric supercapacitor device with CF@NiPx as the cathode and reduced graphene oxide attached on CF@Ni (CF@Ni@RGO) as the anode was observed to achieve a remarkable volumetric energy density of 8.97 mW h cm(-3), excellent flexibility and superior long term cycling stability. All these results render our fiber-based CF@NiPx electrodes as an ideal platform for electrocatalysis and flexible electrochemical energy storage applications.									128	10	0	0	5	0	129			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000378946700042

Therefore, to find clean, renewable, and carbon-free alternative energy sources such as hydrogen energy is greatly needed. In this work, hydrogen was photo-catalytically evolved with Zn(O,S) nanoparticles (NPs) in 10% ethanol as a hole scavenger reagent without Pt as a co-catalyst under low UV light illumination. To find out the optimum processing temperature, Zn(O,S) NPs were prepared in three different temperatures (50, 70, and 90 degC) with 4-h reactions in aqueous solution. The as-prepared catalysts were tested for their capabilities to evolve hydrogen and the experimental data revealed the produced hydrogen amounts were enhanced as the processing temperature increased. It was also found that the as-prepared catalysts were reusable and stable, although the colour of catalyst was changed from white to grey during the photocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and was changed back to white colour after HER was accomplished. The change in catalyst colour indicated the formation of oxygen vacancy on catalyst which further enhanced the HER. The highest amount of evolved hydrogen achieved 2.7 mmol/gh.					2nd International Conference on Mechanical, Electronics, Computer, and Industrial Technology2nd International Conference on Mechanical, Electronics, Computer, and Industrial Technology	12-14 Dec. 201812-14 Dec. 2018		Medan, IndonesiaMedan, Indonesia	0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1742-6596			INSPEC:19024971

Especially, developing excellent earth-abundant catalysts for OER is an ongoing challenge. We report a series of cobalt nitride (Co2N0.67)-carbon composites with different textural properties as high-activity OER materials herein. Experimental results demonstrate that the specific morphologies of different carbon matrices (such as carbon nanotubes (CNTs), graphene (GN), macroporous carbons (MPCs), and hollow carbon microfibers (CMFs)) play crucial roles in determining the overall OER catalytic efficacies of corresponding composites. Both SEM and TEM characterization results revealed that monodisperse and tiny Co2N0.67 nanoparticles (NPs) indeed grew uniformly over both the inner and outer walls of CMFs because of the widespread edges and defect sites. This is beneficial to fully expose and utilize active sites on each Co2N0.67 NP. In addition, carbon matrices can also enhance the N content in CoN NPs (from Co5.47N to Co2N0.67) and then promote the catalytic ability of active centers. Benefiting from the unique open hollow architecture, abundant out-of-plane pores, and vast exposed three-phase boundaries dispersed along both inner and outer curve surfaces of Co2N0.67-CMFs; the most notable feature of optimal Co2N0.67-CMFs can provide much better transport pathways that can promote O-2(g) bubbles fast release from active site surfaces. Combined with the advantages described above, Co2N0.67-CMFs indeed possess high efficiency for OER catalysis. They exhibit only a small overpotential of 0.26 V to achieve the current density of 10 mA cm(-2) for OER, which surpasses the state-of-the-art RuO2 OER catalyst (0.273 V). This result is also one of the best values reported up to now. Furthermore, this hybrid catalyst also displays outstanding long-term stability for OER. All results highlight the overwhelming superiority of CMFs as the carbon matrix compared to other reference carbon matrices. Thus, the relatively mild synthesis processes, low-cost precursors, and highly efficient OER catalytic activity of the Co2N0.67-CMFs hybrid catalyst make it promising for industrial water-splitting or rechargeable metal-air batteries.									17	2	0	0	0	0	18			2574-0970			WOS:000461401000010

However, capacity degradation induced by side reactions and structural degradation on the surface has been the main obstacle for their applications. In this work, a stable layer of La4NiLiO8 is coated on Ni-rich material of Li[Ni0.88Co0.09Al0.03]O-2 (NCA) by a facile method. The formation process of the La4NiLiO8 layer is analyzed from both thermodynamic and dynamics aspects. The results indicate that oxygen migration evolution near the NCA surface is effectively reduced, thus improving the structural stability of the lattice and alleviating the side reactions on the surface. The electrochemical and thermal stabilities of NCA material are remarkably improved by coating the La4NiLiO8 layer. This work provides a strategy for effective coating functional materials on Ni-rich cathode materials for LIBs.									10	0	0	0	0	0	10			2196-0216			WOS:000525937400001

In order to rationally design the new generation of efficient (photo)elec-trocatalysts it is critical to establish which performance bottle-necks must be overcome during the complex catalytic transformations. Obtaining such detailed mechanistic and ki-netic knowledge requires the use of operando spectroscopic techniques that are capable of probing the system under operating conditions. Of all the methods available UV-Vis spectroelectrochemistry stands out for its versatility and experimental simplicity which enables the systematic study of samples under a wide range of reaction conditions. From a mechanistic viewpoint, this technique allows us to quantify the accumulation of reactive species at the catalyst-electrolyte interface and, through a kinetic population model, opens the door to characterising the kinetics of the rate determining step of catalysis. Here, we review the different information that can be extracted from UV-Vis spectroelectrochemistry and how it can be used to understand catalytic mechanisms in solid (photo)electrodes.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			2451-9103			WOS:000863234700006

Studies on the origin and evolution of life provide a reasonable explanation for the prominent presence of this unruly class of chemical reactions. These reactions have been implicated in aging. Aging is the accumulation of changes responsible for the sequential alterations that accompany advancing age, and the associated progressive increases in the chance of disease and death. Aging changes are attributed to the environment and disease, and to an inborn process, the aging process. The latter produces aging changes at an exponentially, increasing rate with advancing age. Improvements in general living conditions decrease the chance of death toward limiting values. Chances for death are now near these limits in the developed countries. Future significant increases in the average life span in the developed countries can only be achieved by slowing the rate of damage produced by the aging process. Support for the possibility that free radical reactions are responsible for the aging process now includes: i) studies on the origin of life and evolution; ii) studies on the effect of ionising radiation on living things; iii) dietary manipulations of endogenous free radical reactions; iv) the plausible explanations it provides for aging phenomena; and v) the growing numbers of studies that implicate free radical reactions in the pathogenesis of specific diseases. It is reasonable to expect on the basis of present data, that the average life expectancy at birth can be increased by 5 or more years by nutritious low caloric diets supplemented with one or more free radical reaction inhibitors.									185	0	0	0	133	1	189			1170-229X	1179-1969		WOS:A1993KN25600006	8453186

Moreover, the electrochemical supercapacitor based on this hierarchical NixP/NF electrode also shows a superior specific capacitance of 1684 mF cm(-2) (382.7 F/g) at a current density of 2 mA cm(-2) and an outstanding retention ratio of 110.9% of its original capacitance value after 4000 cycles in 6M KOH.

In the present work, a core-shell reduced graphene oxide (rGO) on tungsten sulfide (WS2),i.e., rGO@WS(2)nanostructure was successfully preparedviamicrowave irradiation, which was found to catalyze the four-electron ORR in a 0.1 M KOH aqueous solution. The rGO@WS(2)nanostructure showed an onset potential of 0.94 V and a 1.68-fold increase in the kinetic current density (-5.9 mA cm(-2)) for the ORR as, compared to the bare WS(2)nanosheets. The superior performance of the rGO@WS(2)nanostructure posits it as one of the efficient noble-metal-free ORR and MOR electrocatalysts. Predominantly, this work demonstrates the importance of an appropriate core-shell rGO@WS(2)nanostructure in achieving high intrinsic activity for the four-electron ORR and MOR with significantly enhanced efficiency.									13	0	0	0	3	0	14			1144-0546	1369-9261		WOS:000544759800052

Solid polymer electrolyte water electrolysis (SPEWE) is divided into anion exchange membrane electrolysis (AEMWE) carried out in an alkaline environment and proton exchange membrane electrolysis (PEMWE) carried out in an acidic environment. Research on the electrocatalysts used in these electrolysis procedures has focused on the development of transition metal-based catalysts with catalytic activity, high stability, and low cost that can replace the currently used noble-metal based electrocatalysts. Among the various electrocatalyst fabrication methods, electrodeposition can be used to fabricate catalysts in a simple manner at low cost and high purity. In addition, catalysts can be directly electrodeposited onto a substrate such as a gas diffusion layer, simplifying the electrode fabrication process and readily enabling the advantageous control of the physical, chemical, structural, and compositional properties of the catalyst. In this paper, we summarize the characteristics and structures of the water electrolysis catalysts prepared by the electrodeposition method based on recent research studies that suggest their applicability to practical water electrolysis systems in the future.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			0256-1115	1975-7220		WOS:000557498200001

The mesoporous Ni-Co catalyst of 58:42 atomic ratio (Ni58Co42) manifests the highest electrocatalytic activity toward the HER, exhibiting a low onset overpotential (1) of 52 mV and a small Tafel slope of 60 mV dec(-1). In addition, this ordered mesostructured Ni58Co42 catalyst shows a long-term durability under harsh hydrogen evolution cycling test and 25 h chronoamperometry measurement. The outstanding HER electrocatalytic performance of the Ni58Co42 is mainly related to the synergetic combination of Ni and Co, as well as the enlarged exposure of catalytically active sites and improved transport of electrons and reacting agents arising from the unique ordered bicontinuous mesopores.

A precious metal solid solution of RuO2 or IrO2 with TiO2 is the predominant electrocatalyst for the CER. Herein we report that materials comprised only of non-precious metal elements, specifically crystalline transition-metal antimonates (TMAs) such as NiSb2Ox, CoSb2Ox, and MnSb2Ox, are moderately active, stable catalysts for the electrochemical oxidation of chloride to chlorine under conditions relevant to the commercial chlor-alkali process. Specifically, CoSb2Ox exhibited a galvanostatic potential of 1.804 V vs. NHE at 100 mA cm(-2) of Cl-2(g) production from aqueous pH = 2.0, 4.0 M NaCl after 250 h of operation. Studies of the bulk and surface of the electrocatalyst and the composition of the electrolyte before and after electrolysis indicated minimal changes in the surface structure and intrinsic activity of CoSb2Ox as a result of Cl-2(g) evolution under these conditions.									39	1	0	0	4	0	40			1754-5692	1754-5706		WOS:000465275800006

Developing cost-effective OER materials with a high value of practical application is a prerequisite to achieve extreme performance in both activity and stability. Herein, we report a "dual ligand synergistic modulation" strategy to accurately tune the structure of transition-metal materials at atomic level, which finally achieves satisfactory results for the unity between robust stability and high activity. Remarkably, the elaborately designed S and OH dual-ligand NiCo2(SOH)(x) catalyst exhibits an excellent OER activity with a very small overpotential of 0.29 Vat a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) and a strong durability even after 30 h accelerated aging at a large current density of 100 mA cm(-2), both of which are superior to most of the state-of-the-art OER catalysts so far. The density functional theory (DFT) calculations disclose that the synergy of OH and S ligands on the surface of NiCo2(SOH)(x) can delicately tune the electronic structure of metal active centers and their chemical environment, which results in optimal binding energies of the OER intermediates (*OH, *O, and *OOH) and a strengthened binding energy between metal and anion ligands, thus leading to an excellent intrinsically enhanced OER activity and stability, respectively. Meanwhile, the special nonmagnetism of NiCo2(SOH)(x) can significantly weaken the resistance of O-2 desorption on the catalyst surface, thus facilitating the O-2 evolution proceedings.									80	12	0	0	2	0	81			2155-5435			WOS:000417230500019		
J	Zhang, Wenbiao; Yang, Yang; Tang, Yi; Gao, Qingsheng								In-situ reconstruction of catalysts in cathodic electrocatalysis: New insights into active-site structures and working mechanisms								JOURNAL OF ENERGY CHEMISTRY				70				414	436		10.1016/j.jechem.2022.02.036				JUL 2022	2022	Cathodic electrocatalytic reactions, such as hydrogen evolution and CO2/N-2 reduction, are the key processes that store intermittent electricity into stable chemical energy. Although a great progress has been made to boost activity and selectivity via elaborative catalyst design, the structure-property relationships have not been sufficiently understood in the context of surface reconfiguration under working conditions. Recent efforts devoted to tracking dynamic evolution of electrocatalysts using in-situ and/or operando techniques gave new insights into the real structure and working mechanism of active sites, and provided principles to design better catalysts. The achievement of cathodic electrocatalysts in this subject is herein summarized, focusing on the correlations between reconstructed surface and electrocatalytic performance. Briefly, the thermodynamics of reconstruction at cathodes is discussed at first, and then the representative progresses in H-2 evolution and CO2/N-2 & nbsp;reduction are introduced in sequence to acquire insights into electrochemical processes on in-situ reconfigured surfaces or interfaces. Finally, a perspective is offered to guide future investigations. This review is anticipated to shed some new light on in-depth understanding cathodic electrocatalysis and exploiting prominent electrocatalysts.

Ni foam and SS mesh are demonstrated as high-performance and stable electrocatalysts for HER and OER, respectively. For HER, Ni foam exhibited an overpotential of 0.217 V at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) with a Tafel slope of 130 mV dec(-1), which were larger than that of the commercial Pt/C catalyst, but smaller than that of the other conductive substrates. Meanwhile, the SS mesh showed the best electrocatalytic performance for OER with an overpotential of 0.277 V at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) and a Tafel slope of 51 mV dec(-1). Its electrocatalytic performance not only exceeded those of the other conductive substrates but also the commercial RuO2 catalyst. Moreover, both Ni foam and SS mesh exhibited high stability during HER and OER, respectively. Furthermore, in the two-electrode system with Ni foam used as the cathode and SS mesh used as the anode, they enable a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at a small cell voltage of 1.74 V. This value is comparable to or exceeding the values of previously reported electrocatalysts for overall water splitting. In addition, NiO on the surface of Ni foam may be the real active species for HER, NiO and FeOx on the surface of SS mesh may be the active species for OER. The abundant and commercial availability, long-term stability and low-cost property of nickel foam and stainless steel mesh enable their large-scale practical application in water splitting.									67	2	0	0	4	0	68				2046-2069		WOS:000490283500041	35527931

In this work, we reported the catalytic hydrogen generation over a photocatalyst consisting of semiconductor CdS and an up-conversion component NaYF4-Yb3+-Er3+ (NYF) under infrared light irradiation. Under 980 nm laser irradiation, the input infrared light was up-converted into visible light, which was used to excite CdS to produce hydrogen and oxygen. The isotope experiments confirmed both of hydrogen and oxygen were produced from water. The highest hydrogen evolution rate of 3.38 mu mol g(-1) h(-1) has been achieved. 0.008% of AQE under NIR light irradiation has been approached.									20	3	0	0	2	0	20			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000480669500017

In SWB, it is necessary to use an advanced oxygen evolution/reduction reaction (OER/ORR) catalyst for high energy efficiency (EE) in the cathode and a good sodium storage material for a highly reversible capacity in the anode part. In this study, nanostructured and N and P dual-doped hard carbon is fabricated by simply carbonizing abundant biomass, pine pollen. The oxygen electrocatalytic performance of pine pollen carbon (PPC) for a cathode is confirmed by a seawater half-cell test, which exhibits the lowest overpotential reported among Pt/C (20 wt%) and commercial hard carbon (HC) electrodes. The sodium-storage performance of PPC as an anode active material is tested using a coin-type Na half-cell, which exhibits a higher reversible capacity than that of the HC electrode. To reduce the manufacturing cost, this SWB, comprising both PPC electrodes at the anode and cathode, are fabricated and shown an EE of 74% and a coulombic efficiency (CE) of 98%. This study proposes a low-cost and safe ESS system by utilizing seawater as catholyte, bifunctional (OER/ORR, sodiation/desodiation) electrode configuration, and abundantly available biomass carbon.									16	2	0	0	0	0	17			1616-301X	1616-3028		WOS:000633496100001

Herein, a ternary nanocomposite (NiPR) of reduced graphene oxide (rGO), poly (3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT): poly (styrene sulfonic acid) (PSS) and nickel oxide (NiO) nanoplate-nanorod structures has been developed to use as electrooxidation catalyst for methanol and water. Two-dimensional nanostructures have large number of electroactive sites at the surface and conjugation with one-dimensional nanostructure provides additional active sites at the interface. The synergetic effect of conducting polymer of PEDOT:PSS, large surface area of rGO and metal oxide enhances electrical conductivity and also facilitates contact between electrolyte ions and the nanocomposite for methanol and water oxidations. The linear rise in current has been observed with increase in methanol within the concentration range from 0.1 to 2 M. The electrocatalytic activity of the ternary electrocatalyst has been analysed by cyclic voltammetry in 0.5 M methanol containing 0.5 M NaOH at various sweep rates (10-150 mV s(-1)). An anodic current density of 62.6 mA cm(-2) has been obtained with an onset voltage of 0.34 V at a 50 mV s(-1). sweep rate for 0.5 M of methanol oxidation. Moreover, NiPR nanocomposite shows a lower overvoltage of 439 mV vs RHE at 20 mA cm(-2) with a small Tafel slope of 65 mV dec and long-term stability (similar to 7 hours) in 0.5 M NaOH for OER.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0363-907X	1099-114X		WOS:000854956100015

The NiCo2O4/CoO/graphitic carbon composite that displayed optimal OER catalysis was synthesized by nitrate decomposition in the presence of citric acid (synthesized glycine and sucrose variants displayed inferior electro kinetics towards the OER). Screen-printed electrodes modified with ca. 530 mu g cm(-2) of the citric acid NiCo2O4/CoO/graphite variant displayed remarkable OER catalysis with an overpotential (eta) of +323 mV (vs. RHE) (recorded at 10 mA cm(-2)), which is superior to that of IrO2 (340 mV) and RuO2 (350 mV). The composite also exhibited a large achievable current density of 77 mA cm(-2) (at +1.5 V (vs. RHE)), a high O-2 turnover frequency of 1.53 x 10(-2) s(-1) and good stability over the course of 500 repeat cycles. Clearly, the NiCo2O4/CoO composite has the potential to replace precious metal based catalysts as the anodic material within electrolysers, thereby providing a reduction in the associated costs of hydrogen production via water splitting.									13	0	0	0	1	0	13				2046-2069		WOS:000481573800037	35528657

Here, we report the synthesis of cobalt-polyoxometalate nanocomposite with carbon (CoP@C) by greener strategy, which shows an interesting enhancement in the kinetics of oxygen electroreduction process. The CoP@C nanocomposite exhibited improved catalytic activity toward ORR with E-onset 1.00 V vs RHE and current density of 4.2 mA/cm(2) at 1600 rpm in alkaline condition. Further, CoP@C electrocatalyst showed a single step similar to 4 electron transfer pathway, high tolerance to methanol, and exhibited superior stability compared with 20 wt% Pt/C. Thus, CoP@C could be a cheaper and potential candidate for ORR electrocatalysis in fuel cells. The superiority of the catalyst in terms of activity and durability arises due to the uniform distribution of cobalt-polyoxometalate nanoclusters on carbon surface and the synergetic effect of POM, cobalt, and carbon.									6	0	0	0	1	0	6			0363-907X	1099-114X		WOS:000600358200001

However, it is still challenging to design NiFe LDH with both high activity and good stability. Herein, NiFe LDH-Ni(iii)Li is synthesized by a facile approach through valence control of Ni ions and selective doping of Li. Ni(iii) ion percentage is significantly increased from less than 60% to 72.5% in the LDH thanks to the combined benefits of electrochemical oxidation, Mo-leaching and Li-doping. The catalytic activity of NiFe LDH-Ni(iii)Li is greatly promoted because the e(g) electron occupancy of Ni3+ approaches one, producing optimal bond strength with O. Moreover, density functional theory calculations reveal that Li-doping reduces the adsorption energy difference between *OOH and *OH from 3.16 eV to 2.79 eV by the stabilization of *OOH, decreasing the energy barrier of the rate-determining step by 0.29 eV. At the same time, higher covalency of Ni-O bonds results from the enlarged overlap between Ni 3d and O 2p orbitals, further enhancing the OER kinetics. Consequently, NiFe LDH-Ni(iii)Li exhibits excellent OER performance (overpotential of 248 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) on a flat current collector). This work provides a promising technique for engineering the electronic structure of LDH toward outstanding OER properties.									33	1	0	0	2	0	33			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000601282900053

We herein come up with a metal carbonate hydroxide and metal sulfide (MS/MCH) heterostructure via in situ generating MS on MCH to tackle the conflict between activity and durability. The heterostructure in a unique "nanoparticle-in-nanosheet" configuration features abundant hetero-interfaces between MS and MCH, allowing for effective electron transfer from the antibonding orbital of M-S in MS to M-O in MCH and thus improving the stability of sulfides during water oxidation. Simultaneously, such coupling is able to modulate the electronic structure of the metal centre, thus enhancing the intrinsic activity. The coupled heterostructure therefore exhibits steady OER performance with an ultrasmall overpotential of 226 to deliver a current of 10 mA cm(-2) and can output an industrial-level current of 1000 mA cm(-2) at an overpotential of only 367 mV. Furthermore, the overall water electrolyzer with such a heterostructure as an anode presents stable hydrogen production at 100 mA cm(-2) with a small cell voltage of 1.62 V and a high solar to hydrogen efficiency of 16.99%. Such superior catalytic performance demonstrates the feasibility of introducing a heterostructure to tailor the local electrocatalytic properties and opens up an avenue toward designing efficient OER catalysts for clean hydrogen production and diverse energy conversion devices.									17	0	0	0	1	0	17			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000490235800035

Here, a straightforward synthesis of highly efficient bifunctional OER/ORR catalysts MnNiFe/LIG (M111/LIG and M311/LIG where the numbers reflect the relative molar ratio of Mn, Ni, and Fe species) is presented through a facile re-lasing method. The MnNiFe/LIG shows promising performance in Li-O-2 and Li-air batteries without the presence of a redox mediator. The Li-O-2 battery with M311/LIG catalysts is reliably discharged and charged for 150 cycles while the discharge potential slightly increases by 0.24 V. The Li-breathing air battery with M311/LIG catalyst is stable during 350 cycles while the Li-breathing air battery with M111/LIG catalyst is stable for approximate to 300 cycles. The function of the M111/LIG and M311/LIG catalysts in the Li-O-2 batteries and the influence of the catalysts on the discharge and decomposition products are also investigated.

A fundamental understanding of the oxide electronic structures, along with the ability to rationally tune them, is a key step toward designing of highly active catalysts. Here, we report the tuning of the electronic structure of NiO via Li doping (LixNi1-xO) to enhance the OER activities. We identified that Li0.5Ni0.5O (LiNiO2) has the highest OER activity, comparable to or exceeding that of the benchmark perovskite Ba0.5Sr0.5Co0.8Fe0.2O3-delta and LaNiO3. More importantly, a synergistic combination of synchrotron-based photoemission spectroscopy, X-ray absorption spectroscopy, and density functional theory was used to unravel the electronic structure of LixNi1-xO with unprecedented accuracy, thus providing deep insight into the origin of the enhanced catalytic activity. The results unambiguously reveal the creation of a new hole state at 1.1 eV above the Fermi level and an enhanced degree of O 2p-Ni 3d hybridization induced by Li doping optimize the adsorption energetics of OH intermediates and thereby facilitate the fast kinetics for the OER. The LixNi1-xO would serve as a new platform to study the relationship of composition-electronic structure-activity for OER electrocatalysts, beyond the extensively studied Co-based perovskites.									56	1	0	0	1	0	55			0897-4756	1520-5002		WOS:000456749800014

Delafossites with a general formula of ABO(2) as a type of earth-abundant materials are expected to serve as ideal alternatives for water electrolysis. In this work, by fine-tuning the synthesis procedure of delafossite CuGaO2 via surfactant assisted hydrothermal route, we investigated the dependence of their (photo)electrochemical properties on geometry factors. More specifically, the synthesized CuGaO2 samples were characterized by powder XRD, SEM, EDX, XPS, FT-IR, UV-Vis, and BET surface area measurements. Moreover, their electrocatalytic and photoelectrocatalytic performance were tested and compared toward oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Based on cyclic voltammetry and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, their onset potential, current density, Tafel slope, charge transfer resistance, and stability were investigated. It was found that the synthesized delafossite CuGaO2 nanoflakes with the smallest dimensions exhibited the best (photo)electrocatalytic performance and could serve as a potential candidate for cost-effective and active electrode material.

Here, we develop a multistep "molecule/ion-exchange" strategy toward the synthesis of hierarchically macro/mesoporous Fe,Ni-doped CoSe/N-doped carbon nanoshells with tunable pore structures and compositions. Polystyrene (PS)@Co-based amorphous coordination polymer (Co-CP) core-shell particles with hierarchically macro/mesoporous nanoshells are first prepared by ligand-molecule-exchange etching of the outer layers in PS@Co-based metal-organic framework precursors. Afterward, a liquid-solid dual-ion-exchange reaction of PS@Co-CP particles with [Fe(CN)(6)](3-) and [Ni(CN)(4)](2-) ions leads to the formation of PS@Co-CP/Co-Fe Prussian blue analogue (PBA)/Co-Ni PBA particles, which are further transformed into hierarchically macro/mesoporous Fe,Ni-doped CoSe/N-doped carbon particles via a vapor-solid selenization reaction. Moreover, this approach could be extended to synthesize different hierarchically porous core-shell composites with various morphologies and tailored compositions. Because of their unique hierarchically porous nanoarchitecture, these Fe,Ni-doped CoSe/N-doped carbon particles with optimized composition show enhanced performance for electrocatalytic oxygen evolution.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			0020-1669	1520-510X		WOS:000648429200070	33844529

The Ti100-xCux glassy alloy with x = 34, 50, and 66 wt % was investigated using cyclic voltammetry, impedance spectroscopy, and photoelectrochemistry in a borate buffer, pH 9.2, and compared to its polycrystalline components (Ti and Cu). The surface films on Ti-Cu alloys, as well as the film on titanium, exhibit specific features characteristic for n-type semiconductor electrodes. Anodic kinetics suggest that the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is greatly facilitated at the oxidized alloys as compared to the pure components. Increasing the Cu content in the alloy causes increasing catalytic activity for oxygen evolution as well as increasing corrosion protection due to the TiO2 content of the anodic oxide. The mechanism of the OER was interpreted in terms of electron tunneling from the oxide ions in the active centers in the electrode (into the empty conduction band) as the rate-determining step followed by a faster electrochemical process.

Synchrotron XRD can provide much higher X-ray intensity and time resolution than traditional in-house diffractometers, and therefore can contribute to quantitative analysis for Li-O-2 batteries. Here, operando synchrotron XRD is further developed to quantitatively study Li-O-2 batteries with nano catalysts, Ru/MnO2. The time-resolved oxygen evolution reaction (OER) kinetics for Li-O-2 cells with Ru/MNT was systematically investigated using operando synchrotron radiation powder X-ray diffraction (SR-PXD). Li2O2 decomposition in the electrodes with Ru/MNT catalysts during galvanostatic and potentiostatic charge processes followed pseudo-zero-order kinetics and showed ideal Coulombic efficiency (close to 100%). Furthermore, it was found that the OER kinetics for a cell with 2 wt% Ru/MNT charged at a constant potential of 4.3 V was even faster than that for a cell with the same amount of pure Ru nanoparticles, which have been considered as a highly active catalyst for Li-O-2 batteries. These results indicated that Ru/MNT with a special nanostructure represented a very efficient electrocatalyst for promoting the OER in Li-O-2 batteries. We also demonstrate that synchrotron radiation XRD can "highlight" a way to quantitative analysis for Li-O-2 batteries. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Various techniques were then used to characterize thickness, length, and concentration of these nanosheets. WS2 nanosheets were also loaded on alpha-Fe(2)O(3)photoanodes to prepare core-shell structured alpha-Fe2O3/WS2/WOx photoanodes. These core-shell structured alpha-Fe2O3/WS2/WOx nanorods have advantages of effective separation, decreased recombination of photo-generated electron-hole pairs, and increased electron transport properties, resulting in improved PEC performance. The best photoanode (alpha-Fe2O3/#4-WS2/WOx) had photocurrent densities of 0.98 and 2.1 mA cm(-2) (with the lowest onset potential 0.54 VRHE and 0.47 VRHE) under front and backside illumination, respectively, at 1.23 VRHE under 100 mW cm(-2), which were about 13 and 30-fold higher than those of pure alpha-Fe2O3 photoelectrode. Furthermore, H-2 and O-2 production of alpha-Fe2O3/#4-WS2/WOx photoanode were 32 mu mol.cm- 2 and 15.3 mu mol.cm(-2), respectively at 1.23 VRHE under 100 mW cm(-2) after 2 h.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000798702800001

Here, we report the roles of Ni and Fe on the OER activity and stability of metallic NiFe and pure Ni thin films in alkaline media. Our results support that Ni(OH)(2)/NiOOH does not contribute to the OER directly, but it serves as an ideal host for Fe incorporation, which is essential for obtaining high OER activity. Furthermore, the availability of Fe in the electrolyte is found to be important and necessary for both NiFe and pure Ni thin films to maintain an enhanced OER performance, while the presence of Ni is detrimental to the OER kinetics. The impacts of Fe and Ni species present in KOH on the OER activity are consistent with the dissolution/re-deposition mechanism we proposed. Stability studies show that the OER activity will degrade under prolonged continuous operation. Satisfactory stability can, however, be achieved with intermittent OER operation, in which the electrocatalyst is cycled between degraded and recovered states. Accordingly, two important ranges, that is, the recovery range and the degradation range, are proposed. Compared to the intermittent OER operation, prolonged continuous OER operation (i.e., in the degradation range) generates a higher NiOOH content in the electrocatalyst, which is likely related to the OER deactivation. If the electrode works in the recovery range for a certain period, that is, at a sufficiently low reduction potential, where Ni3+ is reduced to Ni2+, the OER activity can be maintained and even improved if Fe is also present in the electrolyte.									21	0	0	0	0	0	21			2155-5435			WOS:000687845800046		
J	XU, Q; BRICKER, TM								STRUCTURAL ORGANIZATION OF PROTEINS ON THE OXIDIZING SIDE OF PHOTOSYSTEM-II - 2 MOLECULES OF THE 33-KDA MANGANESE-STABILIZING PROTEINS PER REACTION CENTER								JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL CHEMISTRY				267	36			25816	25821						DEC 25 1992	1992	The 33-kDa manganese-stabilizing protein stabilizes the manganese cluster in the oxygen-evolving complex. There has been, however, a considerable amount of controversy concerning the stoichiometry of this photosystem II (PS II) component. In this paper, we have verified the extinction coefficient of the manganese-stabilizing protein by amino acid analysis, determined the manganese content of oxygen-evolving photosystem II membranes and reaction center complex using inductively coupled plasma spectrometry, and determined immunologically the amount of the manganese-stabilizing protein associated with photosystem II. Oxygen-evolving photosystem II membranes and reaction center complex preparations contained 258 +/- 11 and 67 +/- 3 chlorophyll, respectively, per tetranuclear manganese cluster. Immunoquantification of the manganese-stabilizing protein using mouse polyclonal antibodies on "Western blots" demonstrated the presence of 2.1 +/- 0.2 and 2.0 +/- 0.3 molecules of the manganese-stabilizing protein/tetranuclear manganese cluster in oxygen-evolving PS II membranes and highly purified PS II reaction center complex, respectively. Since the manganese-stabilizing protein co-migrated with the D2 protein in our electrophoretic system, accurate immunoquantification required the inclusion of CaCl2-washed PS II membrane proteins or reaction center complex proteins in the manganese-stabilizing protein standards to compensate for the possible masking effect of the D2 protein on the binding of the manganese-stabilizing protein to Immobilon-P membranes. Failure to include these additional protein components in the manganese-stabilizing protein standards leads to a marked underestimation of the amount of the manganese-stabilizing protein associated with these photosystem II preparations.									77	3	0	0	70	0	80			0021-9258	1083-351X		WOS:A1992KD07300038	1464595

Pt-TiO2 catalysts are widely studied due to the optical effect of TiO2, which is beneficial for electron transfer during methanol oxidation. However, different configurations of these catalysts are insufficient in research. Here, we report rationally designed Pt nanoparticles with TiO2-skin as electrocatalysts for methanol oxidations and oxygen reduction reactions. Methanol oxidation current densities of the Pt-TiO2 nanoparticles are largely improved under irradiation. When the catalysts are tortured successive at ultrahigh current up to 1.0 mA cm(-2), the potential-increase is as small as 90 mV. It shows good stability with a peak current fades of 4% after 250 cycles under illumination, compared with 13% in the dark. It also exhibits a much better oxygen reduction durability compared with Pt/C. By mechanism analysis, we believe the excellence in photoelectrochemistry is attributed to the TiO2-skin. The electrons generated in TiO2 spontaneously migrate to Pt nanoparticles, which provide a partially reducing atmosphere to prevent Pt nanoparticles from ionization and dissolution.

For this purpose, the separate response of one electrode (anode or cathode) was magnified by dilution of the reacting gas, respectively hydrogen and oxygen, and comparison of the experimental data in the form of steady voltage-current variations and impedance spectra. Experiments were carried out at 60 degrees C and ambient pressure. Water management was thoroughly controlled so that the gases leaving the cell had the same relative humidity in all experiments of one series. Hydrogen oxidation, although rapid, corresponds to overpotentials up to 50 mV at high dilution rates and current densities. Assuming a Tafel-Volmer mechanism, the exchange current density of the anode reaction at the Pt surface is of the order of 1 mA cm(-2). The two techniques employed led to Tafel slopes of oxygen reduction ranging from 120 to 150 mV/decade, with an exchange current density near 1 mu A cm(-2), in good agreement with published data.					7th European Symposium on Electrochemical Engineering7th European Symposium on Electrochemical Engineering	OCT, 2005OCT, 2005		Toulouse, FRANCEToulouse, FRANCE	13	1	0	0	0	0	13			0021-891X	1572-8838		WOS:000243046600015

Although electrocatalysts for the oxygen-evolution reaction derived from metallic Ir and Ni have mutually similar overpotentials in alkaline media, Si/a-TiO2/Ir interfaces exhibit higher overpotentials than Si/a-TiO2/Ni interfaces. The data allow formulation of full band energy diagrams for n-Si/a-TiO2/metal interfaces for M = Ni, Ir, or Au. Although both Ni and Ir produce band bending in a-TiO2 favoring hole conduction, only Ni creates multiple states within the a-TiO2 band gap at the a-TiO2/Ni interface, which produces a quasi-metallic interface at the a-TiO2/Ni junction. Au, however, produces a flat-band interface that limits hole conduction without any new band gap states.									7	0	0	0	0	0	7			0897-4756	1520-5002		WOS:000623043600018

However, the transformation is so rapid that a high exposure of as-transformed (oxy)hydroxides cannot be achieved, thereby hindering the OER efficiency of the electrocatalyst. Herein, we report a simple self-sacrificing strategy to increase this exposure. A trimetallic selenide heterostructure (FeCoMo-Se) consisting of FeSe2, CoSe2 and MoSe2 is first one-step synthesized on a carbon cloth substrate. The heterostructure possesses a thin nanosheet morphology due to the support of MoSe2 nanosheets as a structural template. Under OER conditions, FeSe2 and CoSe2 are then in situ converted to FeCo-oxyhydroxide while retaining the nanosheet morphology of the heterostructure. Interestingly, MoSe2 is self-sacrificially dissolved and hence leaves considerable space to increase the exposure of FeCo-oxyhydroxide to the electrolyte. Such an advantageous nanostructure endows the FeCoMo-Se-transformed electrocatalyst with excellent OER performance in an alkaline medium, which is much higher than the non-MoSe2-containing selenide FeCo-Se. Density functional calculations demonstrate the favorable intermediate bindings in FeCo-oxyhydroxide. This novel self-sacrificing strategy opens up new avenues in the development of high-performance OER electrocatalysts with respect to their in situ oxidation transformation.									29	0	0	0	2	0	29			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000530495500039

To meet the thermodynamic potential of the OER and smoothly transfer charge, a high bias voltage is often required, which, however, increases energy consumption. Here, we demonstrate that using photoanode instead of dark anode can remarkably reduce the energy required. Electrons for NH3 synthesis originally provided via OER are replaced by photoelectrons, and the power input for driving charge transfer can be partially or even eliminated completely depending on the Fermi level of photoanode. In view of this, we substituted the OER with photoelectrocatalytic bisphenol A degradation (similar to 99.6%) and achieved abundant electrons supply for NH3 synthesis over Ru single atoms embedded Cu2O (yield: similar to 37.4 mu g h(-1) mg(cat.)(-1), FE: similar to 17.1%) at low voltage. Compared with the individual NH3 synthesis, the integrated system reduces energy consumption by similar to 51.8%. Life cycle assessment shows that this system is more sustainable and economically viable.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000724811800004

However, the high cost and slow-rate catalysts hinder commercial applications. Although an important process for manufacturing of hollow structures, it is difficult to construct complicated hollow structures with an excellent and regulable shape for multi-component materials. In this study, we demonstrate that sulfur-Co,Fe bimetallic nitrogen carbon hollow composite hybrids (x-S-CoFe@NC) can be synthesized by regulating the amount of sulfur and using the hydrothermal method. For OER, 32-S-CoFe@NC exhibits excellent electrocatalytic activity with a low overpotential of 232 mV, which is higher than those of 0-S-CoFe@NC (270 mV), 23-S-CoFe@NC (247 mV), and RuO2 (243 mV) catalysts at 10 mA cm(-2). In addition, with air as the cathode, a rechargeable Zn-air battery with outstanding long-life cycling stability for 80 hours based on 32-CoFe@NC + Pt/C is proposed. The advanced technique described here supplies a new route for preparing hollow transition bimetal carbon hybrids with an adjustable composite arrangement for electrocatalysis and water splitting.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1477-9226	1477-9234		WOS:000850244000001	36065899

Up to now, sulfides with spinel structure have been considered as the most promising electrocatalysts to replace noble metal catalysts, but generally their catalytic activities are still unsatisfactory. Based on above situation, we used onestep solvothermal method to synthesis two CuCo2S4 nanosheets by introducing two different surfactants. Two CuCo2S4 nanosheets both show outstanding catalytic properties for OER. Specifically, CuCo2S4 CNS exhibits the best OER performance with a low overpotential of 269 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) and a small Tafel slope of about 41 mV dec(-1) in 1.0 M KOH. The CV scanning and chronoamperometry tests also show its excellent stability. XPS analysis reveals the introduction of Cu ions into Co3S4 lattice improve the relative concentration of Co3+ on CuCo2S4 nanosheets surface, which makes the catalytic performance get extensively improvement.									18	1	0	0	1	0	18			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000580627000068

The generation rates of V-2 and vacancy-oxygen (VO) complexes were found to increase in Ge doped silicon as compared with the controlled Cz silicon, which could be ascribed to the increased availability of vacancies in Ge doped silicon arising from the temporary trapping of vacancies associated with the transient GeV pairs. Upon annealing, most of the V-2 complexes were eliminated via the reaction between divacancy and self-interstitials (Si-i) (V-2 + Si-i -> V), while only 6-24% of V-2 complexes were transformed into V2O complexes via the trapping of V-2 complexes by interstitial oxygen (Oi), as V-2 diffuses much faster than O-i. It was observed that Ge doping accelerated the V-2 annihilation and in turn suppressed the transformation of V-2 into V2O complexes. Those phenomena can be attributed to the increased availability of free self-interstitials in Ge doped silicon, which enhances the recombination of V-2 with Si-i. Additionally, an increased production of V3O complexes was observed in Ge doped silicon. The role of Ge atoms in the V3O formation was discussed in view of the two reactions V-2 + VO -> V3O and V2O + V -> V3O.					17th Conference on Defects-Recognition, Imaging and Physics in Semiconductors (DRIP)17th Conference on Defects-Recognition, Imaging and Physics in Semiconductors (DRIP)	OCT 08-12, 2017OCT 08-12, 2017	Univ Valladolid, Condensed Matter Phys Dept, GdS Optronlab Grp; Univ Valladolid; Gobierno Espana, Ministerio Economia Competitividad; Univ Valladolid, Parque CientificoUniv Valladolid, Condensed Matter Phys Dept, GdS Optronlab Grp; Univ Valladolid; Gobierno Espana, Ministerio Economia Competitividad; Univ Valladolid, Parque Cientifico	Valladolid, SPAINValladolid, SPAIN	2	0	0	0	0	0	2			0361-5235	1543-186X		WOS:000458770800017

A meniscus cell was used to screen-test candidate catalysts for their bifunctionality and assess their activity for ORR at 3 mm depth of immersion (DOI) in the electrolyte. Based on the meniscus data LaNiO3, La0.1Ca0.9MnO3 and La0.6Ca0.4CoO3 were selected for further assessment in microelectrode and half-cell studies. Activity tests for the ORR and OER, Tafel slopes at high current densities and apparent activation energies for the ORR were determined using a microelectrode technique on samples of the selected perovskites, La0.1Ca0.9MnO3, La0.6Ca0.4CoO3 and LaNiO3 with and without graphite support. Tafel slopes of ca. 120 mV per decade and apparent activation energies of approximately 18 kcal mol(-1) were measured at high cathodic current densities. Cycle-life and performance of La0.1Ca0.9MnO3, La0.6Ca0.4CoO3 and LaNiO3-based gas-diffusion electrodes in half-cell configurations were tested at a constant current density of 25 mA cm(-2) With subsequent and intermittent polarizations. Similar activities resulted in the ORR, while increased numbers of cycles were observed for the La0.1Ca0.9MnO3-based electrode. Furthermore, electrode material compositions, especially PTFE contents were optimized to conform to the establishment of the three phase interactions of the electrode structure, Transmission Electron microscopy (TEM) and BET-surface area analyses were carried out in order to find out the morphological and surface properties of the perovskite materials.

Platinum (Pt) is an ideal material for HER electrocatalysts in terms of low overpotential and fast kinetics. An effective method to improve the atom utilization efficiency of Pt is to fabricate Pt-based core-shell or nanocage structures with ultra-thin walls. This paper describes the construction of bilayer palladium (Pd)-Pt alloy nanocages catalyst with enhanced HER catalytic activity. The nanocages were fabricated by etching away the Pd templates of multishelled nanocubes composed of alternate shells of Pd and Pt with well-defined (100) facets. The bilayer Pd-Pt nanocages with sub-nanometer shells have a high dispersion of the active atoms on the outside and inside surfaces of outer layer and inner layer, respectively. Moreover, the Pd-Pt alloy lowers the overpotential for HER and speeds up the reaction rate of HER due to the synergies between Pd and Pt. The rational design of bilayer nanocages provided a novel route for boosting the atom utilization efficiency of Pt catalysts.									32	3	0	0	0	0	31			1998-0124	1998-0000		WOS:000485041800025

Herein, we developed an efficient OER electrocatalyst with nickel boride (Ni3B) nanoparticles as cores and nickel(II) borate (Ni-B-i) as shells (Ni-B-i@NB) via a very simple and facile aqueous reaction. This electrocatalyst exhibited a small overpotential of 302 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) and Tafel slope of 52 mV dec(-1). More interestingly, it was found that the OER activity of Ni-B-i@NB was closely dependent on the crystallinity of the Ni-B-i shells. The partially crystalline Ni-B-i catalyst exhibited much higher activity than the amorphous or crystalline analogues; this higher activity originated from the enhanced intrinsic activity of the catalytic sites. These findings open up opportunities to explore nickel(II) borates as a new class of efficient nonprecious metal OER electrocatalysts, and to improve the electrocatalyst performance by modulating their crystallinity.									208	17	0	0	3	0	213			1433-7851	1521-3773		WOS:000401791900038	28470991

After integrating metal phosphides with defective MOFs, the electrocatalyst shows a low overpotential of 295 mV at 10 mA cm(-2)and long-term OER stability, both of which are primarily attributed to the enlarged electrochemically active surface area and accelerated charge-transfer rate in the unique structure.									30	1	0	0	2	0	31			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000551538000021

Using first-principles calculations, we have investigated the potential of using a transition metal (TM) atom embedded on defective MXene nanosheets (Ti3-xC2Oy and Ti2-xC2Oy with a Ti vacancy) as a single-atom electrocatalyst (SAC) for the nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR). The Ti3-xC2Oy nanosheet with Mo and W embedded, and the Ti2-xC2Oy, nanosheet with Cr, Mo, and W embedded, can significantly promote the NRR while suppressing the competitive hydrogen evolution reaction, with the low limiting potential of -0.11 V for W/Ti2-xC2Oy. The outstanding performance is attributed to the synergistic effect of the exposed Ti atom and the TM atom around an extra oxygen vacancy. The polarization charges of the active center are reasonably tuned by the embedded TM atoms, which can optimize the binding strength of key intermediate *N2H. The good feasibility of preparing such TM SACs on defective MXenes and the high NRR selectivity with regard to the competitive HER suggest new opportunities for driving NH3 production by MXene-based SAC electrocatalysts under ambient conditions.									48	3	0	0	1	0	48			1948-7185			WOS:000547468400020	32536165

Its activities strongly depend on redox states and oxygen vacancy concentration. Understanding the functionality of chemical active species and behavior of oxygen vacancy during operation, especially in high-temperature solid-state electrochemical cells, is the key to advance future material design. Herein, the structure evolution of ceria is spatially resolved using bulk-sensitive operando X-ray diffraction and spectroscopy techniques. During water electrolysis, ceria undergoes reduction, and its oxygen non-stoichiometry shows a dependence on the electrochemical current. Cerium local bonding environments vary concurrently to accommodate oxygen vacancy formation, resulting in changes in Ce-O coordination number and Ce3+/Ce4+ redox couple. When reduced enough, a crystallographic phase transition occurs from alpha to an alpha' phase with more oxygen vacancies. Nevertheless, the transition behavior is intriguingly different from the one predicted in the standard phase diagram of ceria. This paper demonstrates a feasible means to control oxygen non-stoichiometry in ceria via electrochemical potential. It also sheds light on the mechanism of phase transitions induced by electrochemical potential. For electrochemical systems, effects from a large-scale electrical environment should be taken into consideration, besides effective oxygen partial pressure and temperature.									6	0	0	0	1	0	6			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000551488400044	32559058

The results showed that under conditions of potentiostatic polarization at constant potential, the reaction rate reaches a maximum value of 125 mA cm(-2) and a faradaic yield of 30%. From about 1.9V, the reaction kinetics are increasingly inhibited as the potential shifts positively. Rapid scanning potential voltammetry was used to characterize the oxidation state of the electrode surface, This method shows that the growth of alpha (PtO) and beta (PtO2 or PtO3) oxides depend on the applied potential. It also establishes a correlation between the inhibition of P2O84- ion electrosynthesis and the beta oxide coating surface. When 2 x 10(-3) M KSCN is added to the solution, some oxygen evolution sites are selectively blocked and beta oxide occurs at more positive potential values, Consequently, the rate of peroxodiphosphate ion formation and the faradaic efficiency are increased to 380 mA cm(-2) and 75%, respectively. Under pulsed potential conditions it was possible to reach 1200 mA cm(-2) for P2O84- ion electrosynthesis with a faradaic yield of 82%.									8	0	0	0	1	0	8			0021-891X			WOS:000076048000009

This is well known in heterogeneous gas-phase catalysis but much less discussed for electrocatalysis at electrified liquid-solid interfaces. Here, we demonstrate experimental evidence for electronic catalyst-support interactions in electrochemical environments and study their role and contribution to the corrosion stability of catalyst/support couples. Electrochemically oxidized Ir oxide nanoparticles, supported on high surface area carbons and oxides, were selected as model catalyst/support systems for the electrocatalytic oxygen evolution reaction (OER). First, the electronic, chemical, and structural state of the catalyst/support couple was compared using XANES, EXAFS, TEM, and depth-resolved XPS. While carbon-supported oxidized Ir particle showed exclusively the redox state (+4), the Ir/IrOx/ATO system exhibited evidence of metal/metaloxide support interactions (MMOSI) that stabilized the metal particles on antimony-doped tin oxide (ATO) in sustained lower Ir oxidation states (Ir3.2+). At the same time, the growth of higher valent Ir oxide layers that compromise catalyst stability was suppressed. Then the electrochemical stability and the charge-transfer kinetics of the electrocatalysts were evaluated under constant current and constant potential conditions, where the analysis of the metal dissolution confirmed that the ATO support mitigates Irz+ dissolution thanks to a stronger MMOSI effect. Our findings raise the possibility that MMOSI effects in electrochemistry-largely neglected in the past-may be more important for a detailed understanding of the durability of oxide-supported nanoparticle OER catalysts than previously thought.									294	9	0	0	18	0	295			0002-7863			WOS:000384518400038	27549910

At the photocatalytic anode under UV irradiation and with a potential to generate oxygen evolution being applied, the photocatalytic enhancement was about 90% because of suppression of the recombination of holes and electrons by taking out forcedly the generated electrons through an external bias into a cathode and by the oxygen generated by the electrolytic reaction acting as an acceptor to the electrons. The photocatalytic enhancement effect occurred only when the cell voltage applied to the photocatalytic-electrolysis reactor was over a certain value. The photocatalytic reaction observed on the catalytic oxide electrodes of RuO2 and IrO2 was because of the existence of TiO2 on the electrode surface, which resulted from the oxidation of Ti substrate itself during sintering for the fabrication of the electrodes.

Herein, a layer-type ternary chalcogenide compound, PdPS is proposed as an efficient oxygen reduction reaction electrocatalyst in alkaline medium. PdPS is semiconducting that crystallizes in orthorhombic symmetry. Improvement in conductivity of PdPS using reduced graphene oxide results in excellent electrocatalytic activity. The kinetics is followed by rotating (ring) disk electrode measurements and the composite electrocatalyst is found to be stable, efficient and methanol tolerant. The catalyst is further used as cathode in anion exchange membrane fuel cell and is shown to deliver power density comparable to Pt/C catalyst. In addition, this catalyst is also capable of water oxidation from alkaline solution with favorable electrochemical parameters.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			0378-7753	1873-2755		WOS:000503098300002

To investigate the spin states and the local atomic structure around the TM atoms in delafossite oxides, CuCrO2, CuMnO2, AgFeO2, CuFeO2, AgCoO2, and CuCoO2, were investigated using X-ray absorption spectroscopy. Based on Shannon radii, the extracted TM-O bond lengths showed that TM = Co delafossite oxides are in the low spin (IS) state, while the other delafossite oxides are in the high spin state. Furthermore, non-splitting of Co 3s core level spectra were observed in photoemission spectroscopy, also indicating LS states. In the LS states, Fully-filled t(2g) orbital and its metallic surface states distributing normal to (001) surface is likely associated with high OER activity in TM = O delafossite oxides.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0022-4596	1095-726X		WOS:000469901300012

The band gap illumination of strontium titanate electrodes results in anodic current; the photo-current appears at a bias of ca. 220 mV with respect to flat-band potential. The bias needed to record anodic photo-current increases with pH, reflecting the change in the protonation of surface oxygen atoms. The photo-electrochemical activity of SrTiO3 nanocubes is size-dependent and increases with increasing particle size. Semiquantitative analysis of the observed photo-currents combined with mass spectrometric detection of the reaction products shows that the contact of water with illuminated SrTiO3 nanocubes leads to the formation of oxygen, hydrogen peroxide, and ozone. Oxygen and ozone are the primary products of the water oxidation proceeding on {100}-oriented SrTiO3 faces and their fractions increase with increasing particle size. The hydrogen peroxide is simultaneously produced via oxygen reduction at the low-dimensionality sites (crystal edges, vertices), the abundance of which increases with decreasing particle size.									9	2	0	0	1	0	9			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000467781100026	30985106

The current research mainly focuses on the development of TMPs toward the HER in acidic solutions; however, less efforts have been directed to specifically design TMPs for alkaline HER Here, we design a new bi-functional metal phosphide-oxide catalyst to facilitate the overall multistep HER process in alkaline environments. In this new catalytic system, oxygen-vacancy-rich NiO provides abundant active sites for dissociation of water, and the negatively charged P species in NiP2 facilitate adsorption of hydrogen intermediates. The resulting hybrid NiP2/NiO NRs show excellent alkaline HER catalytic activity and stability. Our work demonstrates that it is highly promising to engineer multiple components in hybrid catalytic systems to enhance the overall reaction kinetics and thus achieve improvements in catalytic performance.									64	3	0	0	5	0	64			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000434101200039	29741363

The study makes it possible to assess the way alloys react to oxidation depending on their composition - which ranges from pure titanium to pure zirconium. The emergence of relaxation of the numerous strains during reaction accounts, in particular, for the catastrophic oxidation of alloys with 30 to 80 at.% zirconium, as well as for the morphological destruction that accompanies the catastrophic oxidation.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			0925-8388	1873-4669		WOS:A1994NB56900028

The explanation is based on the two following postulates: 1. Intermediate states of the water-oxidizing complex can undergo parasitic reduction to lower degrees of oxidation. 2. Photosynthetic apparatus can minimize the unfavorable effect of such reduction by changes in the number of active reaction centers of PS II. Some steady-state characteristics were calculated under these assumptions. The results obtained show that the frequency of P680 excitations at low light intensities becomes as high as that at saturating light provided that the rate of parasitic reduction is comparable with the rate of the slowest reaction in the cycle of the water- oxidizing complex conversions.									6	1	0	0	4	1	7			0137-5881			WOS:000179874800008

The traditional OER catalysts, such as IrO2, RuO2 and their binary or ternary oxides, have finite large-scale commercial applications due to their significant cost and rareness. Here, we hydrothermally synthesized cry-Ir by doping Ir into non-OER active cryptomelane-type manganese oxide to significantly reduce the Ir mass ratio by 60.3% from 85.7% in IrO2 to 34% in the developed catalyst, along with higher OER performance with a lower onset potential and 10 times higher specific mass activity. The special tunnel structure of cryptomelane plays an important role in promoting its OER activity through facilitating water molecular insertion into the tunnel. We combined Raman, XPS and TEM mapping to confirm that no IrO2 composite is present on the cry-Ir surface. The XPS and XAS spectra indicate substitution of Ir4+ on the Mn3+ site and the presence of more 5d states in the Ir site compared to IrO2. The differences in VBS spectra between cry-Ir, IrO2 and cry-Mn indicate that the electronic structure of Ir sites is modified when Ir substitutes Mn3+ sites. Thus, this special tunnel structure and modified Ir electronic structure in cry-Ir are responsible for the outstanding OER performance. Our studies provide an approach for designing effective Ir-based OER catalysts whilst significantly reducing the consumption of precious elements.									47	1	0	0	1	0	47			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000382110900025

At this background, transition metal nitrides (TMNs) have raised lots of attention, because their physical properties are similar to those of metallic elements and TMNs have unique electron orbital structures. The inner nitrogens can increase the electron density of d-bands of transition metals, so that the electronic structures of TMNs are similar with some precious metals, whose density of states can cross the Fermi level. Therefore, TMNs have similar conductivities with metals and possess superior electrocatalytic performance. Nanostructured TMNs tend to have relatively large dispersion and more exposed active sites, which have direct improvement for catalytic activity and stability as electrochemical catalysts. This review summarizes the representative progress of TMNs based catalysts on both synthetic strategies of structural engineering and electronic engineering for improving electrocatalytic performance, especially in hydrogen evolution, oxygen evolution and water splitting. Finally, we further propose the future challenges and research directions of nanostructured TMNs in the electrochemical energy fields of efficient preparations and performance enhancements.									9	0	0	0	0	0	9			2589-7780			WOS:000777772600001

Equivalent circuit analyses indicate that there are three parallel paths for electrode reactions to occur in a cell with porous MIEC electrodes: (i) the triple-phase boundary (TPB) between the electrolyte, the MIEC, and O-2 gas, (ii) the TPB between the current collector, the MIEC, and O-2 gas, and (iii) the interface between the MIEC and O-2 gas. The relative significance of each path is determined not only by the transport and catalytic properties of the MIEC but also by the interfaces between the MIEC and other cell components. The effectiveness of the MIEC/gas interface is influenced by the rates of several sequential processes: transfer of ionic defects across the MIEC/electrolyte interface, transport of ionic and electronic defects in the MIEC, reaction at the MIEC/gas interface, and transport of O-2 in the pores of the MIEC. Accordingly, oxygen diffusion in the MIEC and reaction at the MIEC/gas interface are only part, not the entirety, of the electrode kinetics. In general, the TPBs cannot be ignored without careful analysis or adequate justification. Further, as a first-order approximation, it is demonstrated that the thickness of the electrochemically active layer of a porous MIEC electrode, delta, varies dramatically with the properties of the MIEC. Typically, delta decreases with increased rate of surface reaction and with decreased transport of ionic or electronic defects in the MIEC. In the absence of ionic or electronic transport in the MIEC, for instance, delta approaches zero, i.e., oxygen reduction or evolution can occur only at one of the TPBs.									92	4	0	0	0	0	92			0013-4651			WOS:000071382900032

TiN bridged all-solid Z-scheme CNNS/TiN/TiO2-x heterojunction composites are prepared by a facile in situ reduction strategy for highly promoted photocatalytic hydrogen evolution driven by visible light. The reduction process not only creates oxygen vacancies in TiO2 but also reduces partial TiO2 to TiN. Oxygen defected TiO2-x permits TiO2 visible light absorption capacity. Fermi level equilibrium forms internal electric fields at the interfaces to drive the charge transfer. Meanwhile, TiN electrons mediator connects the conduction band of TiO2-x and the valance band of CNNS, which is advantageous for the transfer of photoelectrons from the conduction band of TiO2-x to the valance band of CNNS. Compared with pure carbon nitride (CN), TiO2, and even composites CN/TiO2 without TiN, CNNS/TiN/TiO2-x shows a remarkably enhanced visible light catalytic hydrogen evolution performance of 1230 mu mol g(-1) h(-1), about 95 times than that of pure CN. The dramatically boosted photocatalytic activity is attributed to the extra visible light absorption capacity of TiO2-x and convenient electron transfer between CNNS and TiO2-x through TiN electrons mediator.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			2196-7350			WOS:000678843800001

However, the underlying mechanisms are still not fully understood. In situ transmission electron microscopy experiments provide a powerful tool to elucidate these mechanisms. In this contribution, we demonstrate a TEM lamella geometry for in situ biasing with two fixed electrode contacts ensuring low and stable contact resistances. We use Pr1-xCaxMnO3-delta sandwiched by Pt electrodes as model system. The evolution of manganese valence state during electric stimulation in different environments is mapped by means of electron energy loss spectroscopy with high spatial resolution in STEM. Correlation of Mn valence with local oxygen content is found. In addition to electrically driven switching, beam-induced redox reactions in oxygen environment are observed. This effect might be restricted to thin lamellae. In general, our results support that bulk oxygen electromigration is the relevant mechanism for non-volatile resistive switching in PCMO.

The products were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The electrochemical properties were investigated by cyclic voltammetry and polarization measurements in O-2 and Cl-2 evolution in H2SO4 and NaCl solution. The XRD analysis showed that in both TRL and TR, the particles of the synthesized coatings were of low crystallinity, and that they were mainly formed of two phases, rutile TiO2 and RuO2. SEM confirmed that the surface of TRL and TR coatings had a cracked mud appearance consisting of blocks separated by cracks. The morphology of the TRL coating shows irregular crack blocks, which increased the specific area greatly and provides more active sites. Polarization measurements indicate that the onset potential of chlorine evolution reaction for TRL coating was 1.08 V-SCE, which is lower than the value of 1.12 V-SCE registered for the TR coating The onset potentials for oxygen evolution for the two coatings were similar. Cyclic voltammetry shows an improvement of the electrochemical capacity for the La-doped coatings.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0352-5139			WOS:000445403600004

Inspired by Nature's oxygen evolution cluster in photosystem II and the highly efficient artificial OER catalyst of NiFe layered double hydroxide (LDH), we designed an electrostatic 2D-2D assembly route and successfully synthesized a 2D LDH(+)-Birnessite(-) hybrid. The as-constructed LDH(+)-Birnessite(-) hybrid catalyst showed advanced catalytic activity and excellent stability towards OER under a close to industrial hydrogen production condition (85 degrees C and 6 M KOH) for more than 20 h at the current densities larger than 100 mA cm(-2). Experimentally, we found that besides the enlarged interlayer distance, the flexible interlayer NiFe LDH(+) also modulates the electronic structure of layered MnO2, and creates an electric field between NiFe LDH(+) and Birnessite(-), wherein OER occurs with a greatly decreased overpotential. DFT calculations confirmed the interlayer LDH modulations of the OER process, attributable to the distinct electronic distributions and environments. Upshifting the Fe-3d orbitals in LDH promotes electron transfer from the layered MnO2 to LDH, significantly boosting up the OER performance. This work opens a new way to fabricate highly efficient OER catalyst for industrial water oxidation.									24	1	0	0	2	0	25			1433-7851	1521-3773		WOS:000629611300001	33484038

Microaerobic conditions within the infected zone of nodules are maintained primarily by an oxygen diffusion barrier (ODB) located in the nodule cortex. Flexibility of the ODB is important for the acclimation processes of nodules in response to changes in external oxygen concentration. The hypothesis of the present study was that there are additional molecular mechanisms involved. Nodule activity of Medicago truncatula plants were continuously monitored during a change from 21 to 25 or 30% oxygen around root nodules by measuring nodule H-2 evolution. Within about 2 min of the increase in oxygen concentration, a steep decline in nitrogenase activity occurred. A quick recovery commenced about 8 min later. A qPCR-based analysis of the expression of genes for nitrogenase components showed a tendency toward upregulation during the recovery. The recovery resulted in a new constant activity after about 30 min, corresponding to approximately 90% of the pre-treatment level. An RNAseq-based comparative transcriptome profiling of nodules at that point in time revealed that genes for nodule-specific cysteine-rich (NCR) peptides, defensins, leghaemoglobin and chalcone and stilbene synthase were significantly upregulated when considered as a gene family. A gene for a nicotianamine synthase-like protein (Medtr1g084050) showed a strong increase in count number. The gene appears to be of importance for nodule functioning, as evidenced by its consistently high expression in nodules and a strong reaction to various environmental cues that influence nodule activity. A Tnt1-mutant that carries an insert in the coding sequence (cds) of that gene showed reduced nitrogen fixation and less efficient acclimation to an increased external oxygen concentration. It was concluded that sudden increases in oxygen concentration around nodules destroy nitrogenase, which is quickly counteracted by an increased neoformation of the enzyme. This reaction might be induced by increased formation of NCR peptides and necessitates an efficient iron supply to the bacteroid, which is probably mediated by nicotianamine.The paper is dedicated to the 85th birthday of Prof. Dr. Gunther Schilling, University of Halle/Wittenberg, Germany, https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gunther_Schilling									13	1	0	0	12	0	14			1664-462X			WOS:000367654300001	26779207

Experiments uncovered that under the deposition current density of 10 mA cm(-2), the initial concentration of NiCl2 electrolyte strongly affected the phase of the final product. Metallic nickel was deposited at the low concentration and alpha-Ni(OH)(2)center dot 0.75H(2)O was obtained at the high concentration. It was found that the amount of Cl- anions and the deposition current density were two important factors affecting the formation of alpha-Ni(OH)(2)center dot 0.75H(2)O. Interestingly, the as-obtained alpha-Ni(OH)(2)center dot 0.75H(2)O/ NF exhibited highly efficient electrocatalytic activity in both hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in 1.0 M KOH. In a two-electrode water-splitting device, the alpha-Ni(OH)(2)center dot 0.75H(2)O/ NF deposited at the current density of 10 mA cm(-2) for 60 min was selected as the anode and the cathode simultaneously. The electrochemical measurements showed that the as-obtained alpha-Ni(OH)(2)center dot 0.75H(2)O/ NF electrode presented excellent electrocatalytic activity and stability matched with Pt/C/NF - RuO2/NF electrodes. Obviously, the present work provides a new path for fast preparation of highly efficient alpha-Ni(OH)(2)center dot 0.75H(2)O electrocatalyst for overall water splitting. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Major roadblocks for the realization of this technology however are the limited light absorption, as this material usually absorbs only in the UV, and the sluggish water oxidation kinetics at the electrode/electrolyte interface. Various efforts have nonetheless demonstrated absorption and photocurrent generation with visible light while a typical solution for the slow water oxidation is electrode modification via oxygen evolution catalysts; Ni-Fe (oxy) hydroxides in particular are among the highest turn-over efficiency and low-cost catalysts. Studies about loading Ni-Fe (oxy) hydroxides onto anodic TiO2 nanotubes by electrodeposition methods are rarely reported and the influence of the loaded catalysts on the photoanode performance is not fully understood. In this work, Ni-Fe (oxy) hydroxides are first electrodeposited on Au substrates; the as-deposited catalysts indicate enhanced oxygen evolution catalytic activity. The same deposition method is then applied at various TiO2 nanotube systems. Specifically, mouths, walls and whole bodies of anodic TiO2 nanotubes are electrodeposited with Ni-Fe (oxy) hydroxides and the corresponding photo response to water oxidation are investigated. We show that at relatively low applied potential (<= 1.5 V vs. RHE) the Ni-Fe (oxy) hydroxides layer significantly reduces photon absorption and facilitates interfacial recombination, leading to a decreased photocurrent density. In contrast, at relatively high bias (>1.5 V vs. RHE), the oxygen evolution is enhanced due to the intrinsic electro-catalytic properties of the loaded catalysts. Synergistic effect are not found in the three Ni-Fe (oxy) hydroxide films deposited at TiO2 nanotube systems. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

However, most of the present electrocatalysts show high overpotentials at a large current density, inducing a low efficiency for industrial water electrolysis. Herein, using the classic NiCoP nanorod arrays as the basic catalyst model, we presented a trace W and Mo co-doped strategy to boost the overall water splitting electrocatalysis at an industrial current density. After a trace amount of W and Mo atoms was doped, the constructed W and Mo co-doped NiCoP nanorod arrays (W,Mo-NiCoP/NF) show a low overpotential of 249 mV towards the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) at a very large current density of 1000 mA cm(-2). We deduce that the regulation of the electronic structure caused by the trace W and Mo atoms, as well as the intrinsic features of nanoarrays leads to enhanced catalytic activity. In addition, a significant enhancement towards the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) was also achieved by this co-doped strategy. Finally, an overall water splitting device using W,Mo-NiCoP/NF as both the anode and cathode was assembled to exhibit a low cell voltage of 1.85 V at a large current density of 500 mA cm(-2) and an excellent long-term stability within 50 h, better than most of the state-of-the-art bifunctional electrocatalysts yet reported. Our results highlight the significance of trace-doping engineering in industrial water electrolysis.									13	0	0	0	0	0	13			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000683764500001	34477699

Samples were studied using a range of standard coal analyses, Rock-Eval analysis, infrared spectroscopy (IR), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and pyrolysis gas chromatography (Py-GC). The structural evolution of coal during diagenesis and moderate catagenesis is dominated by defunctionalisation reactions leading to the release of significant amounts of oxygen and thereby to an enrichment of aromatic as well as aliphatic structures within the residual organic matter. Based on the evolution of pyrolysis yields and elemental compositions with maturity it can be demonstrated that oxygen loss is the major cause for increasing Hydrogen Index values or hydrocarbon generating potentials of coals at such maturity levels. For the first time, the loss of oxygen in form of CO2 has been quantified. During maturation from peat to high volatile bituminous coal ranks similar to 10-105 mg CO2/g TOC has been released. This is equivalent to 2.50E-4 to 1.25E-3 mg CO2 generated from every litre of sediment per year falling into the range of deep biosphere utilisation rates. Immature coals, here New Zealand coals, therefore manifest the potential to feed deep terrestrial microbial life, in contrast to more mature coals (VRr > similar to 0.81%) for which defunctionalisation processes become less important.

Its microstructure and electrocatalytic HER performance were characterized. The results show that addition of Nd improved the electrocatalytic HER. The preparation conditions were optimized with neodymium nitrate of 3 g.L-1, reaction temperature of 35 degrees C and reaction time of 1 h. The Nd-Ni-B/NF electrode requires an overpotential of only 180 mV to achieve the current density of 20 mA.cm(-2) in 1.0 mol.L-1 KOH solution, and the corresponding Tafel slope is 117 mV.dec(-1). HER of Nd-Ni-B/NF catalyst is controlled by Volmer-Heyrovsky step. Moreover, the Nd-Ni-B/Nf shows superior electrochemical stability, 12 h chronoamperometry and 2000 sweeps of cyclic voltammetry with no obvious activity decay.									1	1	0	0	0	0	2			1000-324X			WOS:000654073400010

Otherwise, they can be termed as "precatalysts" rather than real catalysts. Herein, through a strongly atomic metal-support interaction, single-atom dispersed catalysts decorating atomically dispersed Ru onto a nickel-vanadium layered double hydroxide (LDH) scaffold can exhibit excellent HER and OER activities. Both in situ X-ray absorption spectroscopy and operando Raman spectroscopic investigation clarify that the presence of atomic Ru on the surface of nickel-vanadium LDH is playing an imperative role in stabilizing the dangling bond-rich surface and further leads to a reconstruction-free surface. Through strong metal-support interaction provided by nickel-vanadium LDH, the significant interplay can stabilize the reactive atomic Ru site to reach a small fluctuation in oxidation state toward cathodic HER without reconstruction, while the atomic Ru site can stabilize the Ni site to have a greater structural tolerance toward both the bond constriction and structural distortion caused by oxidizing the Ni site during anodic OER and boost the oxidation state increase in the Ni site that contributes to its superior OER performance. Unlike numerous bifunctional catalysts that have suffered from the structural reconstruction/transformation for adapting the HER/OER cycles, the proposed Ru/Ni3V-LDH is characteristic of steady dual reactive sites with the presence of a strong metal-support interaction (i.e., Ru and Ni sites) for individual catalysis in water splitting and is revealed to be termed as a real bifunctional electrocatalyst.									41	3	0	0	2	0	42			0002-7863	1520-5126		WOS:000736493300001	34935380

Herein, we reported an ultrafast and feasible strategy for constructing an S-doped bimetallic iron/nickel oxy(hydroxide) (S-(Fe/Ni)OOH) as a superior electrocatalyst for oxygen evolution reaction (OER). It is prepared by consequent electroplating of nickel nanocone arrays (NiNCAs) on carbon cloth (CC) and stainless-steel mesh (SSM) and then formation of S-(Fe/Ni)OOH layers on them by ultrafast one-step oxidation solution-phase method in the solution of Fe3+ and sodium thiosulfate at room temperature. The derived composite material [S-(Fe/Ni)OOH@NiNCAs on SSM and CC] exhibited high electrocatalytic activity toward OER as well as good durability. The electrochemical measurements demonstrate that S-(Fe/Ni)OOH@NiNCAs-CC and S-(Fe/Ni)OOH@NiNCAs-SSM can drive the benchmark current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at low overpotentials of 248 and 245 mV and current density of 100 mA cm(-2) at overpotentials of 327 and 312 mV with a Tafel slope of 77 and 65 mV dec(-1), respectively. Their outstanding electrocatalytic performances are benefited from porous, highly exposed active sites, accelerated mass and electron transport, and synergistic effects. The prepared composite electrodes act better than most advanced priceless catalysts and noble commercial RuO2 catalysts. This work provides an effective and efficient approach to design porous architecture catalysts on a three-dimensional substrate (SSM and CC) with high performance for energy-relevant and electrocatalysis reactions.									7	0	0	0	0	0	7			2574-0962			WOS:000711236300023

However, the best catalytic performance is found with noble metal-based electrocatalysts, which presents a formidable obstacle for the commercial success of electrolytic water splitting-based H-2 production due to their relatively high cost and scarcity. Therefore, the development of alternative inexpensive earth-abundant electrode materials with excellent electrocatalytic properties is of great urgency. In general, efficient electrocatalysts must possess several key characteristics such as low overpotential, good electrocatalytic activity, high stability, and low production costs. Direct synthesis of nanostructured catalysts on a conducting substrate may potentially improve the performance of the resultant electrocatalysts because of their high catalytic surface areas and the synergistic effect between the electrocatalyst and the conductive substrate. In this regard, three dimensional (3D) nickel foams have been advantageously utilized as electrode substrates as they offer a large active surface area and a highly conductive continuous porous 3D network. In this review, we discuss the most recent developments in nanostructured materials directly synthesized on 3D nickel foam as potential electrode candidates for electrochemical water electrolysis, namely, the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). We also provide perspectives and outlooks for catalysts grown directly on 3D conducting substrates for future sustainable energy technologies.									298	13	1	0	14	1	303			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000409215300002	28819660

Here, we demonstrate the versatility of a self-templated epitaxial growth strategy for construction of single-crystalline hollow nanostructured Prussian blue analogs (PBAs). Specifically, this strategy enables a controllable synthesis of Co-Fe PBA cages, frames, and boxes with diverse geometries by tuning their growth kinetics and thus expands the richness of their topological complexity. As an attempt, the topologies of these structures are identified and discussed. After thermal treatment, the corresponding oxide derivatives with preserved structures exhibit enhanced electrocatalytic activity for the oxygen evolution reaction in alkaline medium, where the frame structures demonstrate the best catalytic performance. Our work may further advance the topology in chemistry and materials science for realizing not only the geometries of the nanostructures but also their topology-dependent catalytic properties.									101	4	0	0	5	0	102			2451-9294			WOS:000441194300019

In this report, oxygen-deficient anatase TiO2 sheets with dominant {001} facets were synthesized via a facile one-pot hydrothermal route with solid metallic titanium diboride as precursor. In contrast to anatase TiO2 sheets with dominant {001} facets free of oxygen deficiency and surface fluorine, anatase TiO2 sheets with oxygen deficiency and surface fluorine are Subject to obvious surface reconstruction as evidenced by two new Raman-active modes at 155 and 171 cm(-1) and the weakened B-1g mode at 397 cm(-1). Further analysis based on X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) spectra of Pt 4f and F Is provided a clear evidence for the greatly strengthened interaction between Pt-loaded and TiO2 matrix as a result of a special electron-transfer process on the reconstructed Surface structure of TiO2 with both oxygen deficiency and fluorine. Importantly, the reconstructed surface structure as well as the strengthened interaction between Pt-loaded and TiO2 matrix can substantially enhance the hydrogen evolution rate from photocatalytic water splitting reactions.									357	24	0	0	27	0	365			1932-7447	1932-7455		WOS:000272936400045

The present study aims to investigate the OER kinetic process and obtain kinetic parameters of the iridium catalyst. The OER rate determining step was investigated by EIS measurements. Meanwhile, OER kinetic parameters were obtained by both steady-state polarization curve measurement and microkinetic modelling. Results show that the rate determining step of OER is the adsorption of Ir-OHads species on active sites. Values of both Tafel slope and exchange current density are important kinetic parameters which are about 48.6 mV/dec and 1.88 x 10(-11) A/cm(2) according to the microkinetic modelling. The obtained parameters could be referred in the novel OER catalysts investigation. The approaches for OER kinetic process study and kinetic parameters evaluation are useful in the investigation of other catalysts.									11	0	0	0	1	0	11			1572-6657	1873-2569		WOS:000554922000019

Based on the time-dependent growth process of cobalt precursors, 1D Co3O4 nanorods and 2D Co3O4 nanosheets were successfully synthesized through a facile hydrothermal process at 180 degrees C under different reaction times, followed by calcination at 300 degrees C for 2 h. Subsequently, 1D and 2D CoSe2 nanostructures were derived by selenization of Co3O4, which achieved the controllable synthesis of CoSe2 without templating agents. By comparing the electrocatalytic behavior of these cobalt-based catalysts in 1 M KOH electrolyte toward the OER, both 2D Co3O4 and 2D CoSe2 nanocrystals have lower overpotentials and better electrocatalytic stability than that of 1D nanostructures. The 2D CoSe2 nanosheets require overpotentials of 372 mV to reach a current density of 50 mA cm(-2) with a small Tafel slope of 74 mV dec(-1). A systematic contrast of the electrocatalytic performances for the OER increase in the order: 1D Co3O4 < 2D Co3O4 < 1D CoSe2 < 2D CoSe2. This work provides fundamental insights into the morphology-performance relationships of both Co3O4 and CoSe2, which were synthesized through the same approach, providing a solid guide for designing OER catalysts.									15	1	0	0	0	0	15			1861-4728	1861-471X		WOS:000444798500016	29964369

Driving forces and activation energies for the dissociative adsorption of methane and for the successive dehydrogenation of adsorbed hydrocarbons are calculated. Energy barriers of some of the dehydrogenation reactions are comparable to the barrier for the dissociative adsorption of methane, contrary to what is often assumed. Moreover, we find that reaction barriers for the early formation of C-O bonds are much lower than those for the complete dehydrogenation of CH4. In particular, reaction of oxygen molecules from the gas phase with suitable configurations of adsorbed H and CH3 can efficiently produce water and CH2O as oxidation products. Along this reaction path, the highest barrier is indeed given by the first dehydrogenation reaction. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Internal peptide fragments were sequenced and cDNAs encoding a polypeptide of 154 amino acids isolated by polymerase chain reaction. The polypeptide lacks a signal sequence, identifying it as a cytosolic myoglobin-like species. The native protein is a dimer. The predicted amino acid sequence shares several unusual substitutions with other nematode globins. Like the abundant pseudocoelomic A. suum hemoglobin it has a Tyr at B10 and a Gln at E7, substitutions thought to be determinants of high affinity. However, the 10-fold lower oxygen affinity of body wall globin suggests that in this molecule Tyr(B10) does not form an additional hydrogen bond with the heme bound oxygen. Evolutionary analysis of the nematode globins suggests that the monodomain myoglobin-like molecules and the two-domain hemoglobin-like molecules diverged about 500 million years ago, well before the divergence of the ascarid genera Ascaris and Pseudoterranova. The absence of introns in the A. suum myoglobin, in contrast to other nematode globin genes, is consistent with the hypothesis that during evolution intron elimination was the predominant event.									29	0	0	0	26	0	30			0021-9258			WOS:A1994PU52500024	7982924

Cyclic voltammetry studies showed two oxidation and one film reduction peaks for Au, while one oxygen evolution reaction for Pt. Increasing H2SO4 concentration (from 0.5 to 1 mol/L) caused 2-fold increases in peak current density of Au. Increase in agitation promoted passive zone of Au, while it was negligible for Pt by potentiodynamic studies. Potentiostatic studies (2 h) at three anodic passive potentials in 1 mol/L H2SO4 showed that the admittance of Au was found to be the lowest at 1.4 V. Electrochemical noise measurements during the decay periods (16 h) after polarization showed that the thin passive film formed during potentiostatic polarization has been dissolved.									12	2	0	0	1	0	12			1003-6326	2210-3384		WOS:000357934300037

The oxygen content in the bio-oil was reduced by aldol condensation and hydrogenation of aldehydes and ketones. The optimal pyrolysis temperature of cellulose and xylan were determined to be 400 C and 350 ? and the carbon yields of aldehydes and ketones reached 54.49% and 52.05% respectively. In order to explore the formation mechanism of aldehydes and ketones, the evolution of typical products by controlling the reaction time was studied. The catalytic pyrolysis was complete and the product content was maximum at 20 min H2O played a role in providing oxygen atoms and increasing ZrO2 reaction activity in the carbonylation process. The binding energy of the catalyst was calculated as-15.69 kcal/mol by density functional theory (DFT). It was found that the presence of water can remove the coke on the catalyst surface and increase the activity of ZrO2. The yield of aldehydes and ketones reached 58.17% and 55.85% of cellulose and xylan with the presence of 15 wt% H2O in the carbonylation process. According to the evolution of the above experimental products, the generation pathways of four main carbonylation products (acetone, methyl ethyl ketone, butyraldehyde and furfural) were proposed. Through this research, the effective utilization of biomass could be realized.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0961-9534	1873-2909		WOS:000814690300002

Various perovskite oxides have been employed as active OER catalysts, however, the underlying mechanism that occurs at the catalyst-electrolyte interface is still not well understood, prohibiting the design and preparation of advanced OER catalysts. Here, we report a systematic investigation into the effect of proton dynamics on the catalyst-electrolyte interfaces of four perovskite catalysts: La0.5Sr0.5CoO3-delta (LSCO), LaCoO3, LaFeO3, and LaNiO3. The pH-dependent OER activities, H/D kinetic isotope effect, and surface functionalization with phosphate anion groups were investigated to elucidate the role of proton dynamics in the rate-limiting steps of the OER. For oxides with small charge-transfer energies, such as LSCO and LaNiO3, non-concerted proton-coupled electron transfer steps are involved in the OER, and the activity is strongly controlled by the proton dynamics on the catalyst surface. The results demonstrate the important role of interfacial proton transfer in the OER mechanism, and suggest that proton dynamics at the interface should carefully be considered in the design of future high-performance catalysts.

The non-uniform distribution of the potential across their surface affects both activity and stability. Studying such heterogeneities at the relevant length scale is crucial for understanding the relationships between structure and catalytic behaviour. Here, we demonstrate an experimental approach combining scanning photoemission electron microscopy and atom probe tomography performed at identical locations to characterise the surface's structure and oxidation states, and the chemical composition of the surface and sub-surface regions. Showcased on an Ir-Ru thermally grown oxide, an efficient catalyst for the anodic oxygen evolution reaction, the complementary techniques yield consistent results in terms of the determined surface oxidation states and local oxide stoichiometry. Significant chemical heterogeneities in the sputter-deposited Ir-Ru alloy thin films govern the oxide's chemistry, observed after thermal oxidation both laterally and vertically. While the oxide grains have a composition of Ir0.94Ru0.06O2, the composition in the grain boundary region varies from Ir0.70Ru0.30O2 to Ir0.40Ru0.60O2 and eventually to Ir0.75Ru0.25O2 from the top surface into the depth. The influence of such compositional non-uniformities on the catalytic performance of the material is discussed, along with possible engineering levers for the synthesis of more stable and reactive mixed oxides. The proposed method provides a framework for investigating materials of interest in the field of electrocatalysis and beyond.									12	0	0	0	0	0	12			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000503772400036

Two electrode materials: Ti/TiO2(70%)-RuO2(30%) and carbon felt, were applied in the investigations as anodes. Voltammetric measurements show that Reactive Blue 81 electrooxidation proceeds easier and with higher rate than electrooxidation of Reactive Red 2. Both dyes are oxidised irreversibly in at least one electrode step before oxygen evolution starts at the electrode. Effectiveness of electrochemical oxidation under potentiostatic conditions achieved for Reactive Blue 81 was higher than for Reactive Red 2, with application of a carbon felt anode. Pulse radiolysis measurements prove addition of (OH)-O-aEuro cent radical to the dye molecule and formation of cyclohexadienyl and naphthoxyl radicals. Results of voltammetric analysis, pulse radiolysis measurements and GC-MS identification of intermediate products suggest two possible pathways of the dyes electrochemical oxidation.									20	3	0	0	5	0	23			0021-891X	1572-8838		WOS:000287248500006

However, electrochemical performance of aspect-ratio-tunable quasi-two-dimensional (2D) nanomaterials with anisotropic properties has not been fully investigated. We prepared monodispersed hexagonal covellite (CuS) nanoplatelets (NPIs) of fixed thickness (similar to 2 nm) but broadly tunable diameter (from 8 to >100 nm). These span a range of aspect ratios, from similar to 4 to >50, connecting quasi-isotropic and quasi 2D regimes. Tests of electrochemical activity of the NPIs for the oxygen reduction reaction in alkaline solution showed improved activity with increasing diameter. Combining experimental results with density functional theory calculations, we attribute size-dependent enhancement to anisotropy of conductivity and electrochemical activity. The lowest computed oxygen adsorption energy was on Cu sites exposed by cleaving covellite along (001) planes through tetrahedrally coordinated Cu atoms. The specific surface area of these planes, which are the top and bottom surfaces of the NPIs, remains constant with changing diameter, for fixed NPI thickness. However, charge transport through the electrocatalyst film improves with increasing NPI diameter. These CuS NPI-carbon nanocatalysts provide inspiration for creating well-controlled layered nanomaterials for electrochemical applications and open up opportunities to design new electrocatalysts using transition-metal sulfides.									9	0	0	0	0	0	9			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000453488900063	30451490

Utilizing density functional theory calculations, we have systematically investigated the neighboring effects between two adjacent Fe-N-C sites of monodispersed Fe-N-C single-atom catalysts on oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). While the thermodynamic limiting potential (U-L) is strongly dependent on the intersite distance and the nature of adjacent active sites in FeN3, it is almost invariable in FeN4 until two FeN4 sites are similar to 4 angstrom apart. Further, under certain conditions, an otherwise unfavorable physisorbed-O(2-)initiated 2e(-) pathway becomes feasible due to charge transfer between reactive species and graphene support. Our results cast new insight into the rational design of high-density single-atom catalysts and may create an alternative route to manipulate their catalytic activities.									26	4	0	0	1	0	27			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000526566900063	32153177

However, the preparation of PBA and their derivatives on specific substrates are still far from practical use. Herein, we propose an innovative general and scalable strategy to grow PBA coatings on any conductive substrates including Ni, Co, stainless steel, Mo, W, Ti, Ta, Ni/carbon cloth (CC), and FTO with large sizes and high curvatures through spontaneous growth or electrodeposited seeds assisted epitaxial growth in solution. The potential difference between Fe3+/Fe2+ redox pair in the solution and metal ions/metal redox pair of the metal substrate may promote the release of metal ions from the substrate and induce the spontaneous growth. As a demonstration, PBA/Ni/CC samples prepared on Ni/CC substrates with this approach were transformed into nickel iron phosphides (NiFeP/CC) via a simple phosphidation process, which show excellent bifunctional electrocatalytic activities towards oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) due to the unique structures and desirable chemical compositions. It only requires very low overpotentials of 260 mV to achieve 200 mA cm-2 for OER and 129 mV to achieve 10 mA cm-2 for HER, respectively. Furthermore, the NiFeP/CC|| NiFeP/CC couple requires a low cell voltage of 1.57 V to reach 10 mA cm-2 and shows an ultralong lifetime with no obvious degradation after electrolyzing for 300 h, which is much superior to many other reported electrocatalysts. This work provides a facile strategy for designing efficient bifunctional electrocatalysts derived from spontaneously grown PBAs.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000664247300001

In each preparation, nitrate salts of lanthanum, copper, cobalt and malic acid were taken as starting material. The pH of the solution was adjusted by using ammonia solution. Techniques used to know the physical properties of the materials were scanning electron microscope (SEM) powder X-ray diffraction (XRD). All the electrochemical viza cyclic voltammetry, roughness factor and anodic polarization studies have been performed in three electrode single compartment glass cell. For the purpose, materials were transferred in the form of oxide film electrode on Ni conducting support. XRD data showed the formation of almost pure phase of the material with hexagonal crystal geometry. The cyclic voltammetric study showed that each oxide electrode exhibited a pair of redox peaks prior to the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The values of Tafel slope (78-90 mV decade(-1)) and reaction order (similar to 1) indicate that each catalyst follows similar mechanistic path. The data of anodic polarization study shows that the substitution of Cu in place of La in the base oxide increases the electrocatalytic activity considerably. The value was found to be highest with 0.4 mol Cu substitution. Electrochemically active area of the material was determined in terms of roughness factor by recording the cyclic voltammograms at different scan rates in the potential region 0.0-0.1V. The roughness factor was observed to be highest with 0.2 mol Cusubstituted oxide.									10	0	0	0	0	0	10			1452-3981			WOS:000408476400018

The results showed that the Ni-Co-S nanomaterials underwent a complex chemical reaction during the sulfidation process. With the increasing of sulfidation time, the nanoflakes of the Ni-Co-S materials experienced the evolution process from the collapse to vertical growth to collapse again. The electro-chemical hydrogen evolution performance of the catalytic material achieves the best for the sample with the sulfidation time of 10 h, which possesses the onset potential of 42 mV and it can maintain its hydrogen evolution performance after 35,000 cycles of CV cycles with negligible losses. The ultrathin and porous structure can provide a huge number of exposed active sites. The highly-conductive Ni foam can promote the electron transfer process, and the three dimensional (3D) networked structure can facilitate the diffusion and penetration of electrolyte.

In general, bare screen-printed carbon electrodes (SPCEs) have negligible ability to catalyze the HER due to the lack of effective sites. Here we find that: 1) a facile anodization treatment can improve the electrocatalytic activity of home-made SPCEs with apparently reduced overpotential and increased current density for the HER; 2) the activity enhancement of SPCEs is highly dependent on anodization conditions including electrolyte, treatment time, and anodization potential; 3) the introduction of negatively charged oxygen-containing functional groups during anodization, together with the increased defect sites and hydrophilicity on electrode surface, leads to the promoted activity of anodized SPCEs synergistically. Similar phenomena are also found in other carbon-based electrodes including glassy carbon electrode and carbon nanotube-modified electrode. These findings reported in this work are expected to guide the future design of advanced electrode systems for efficient hydrogen evolution. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Here, we designed 17 two-dimensional (2D) covalent heptazine frameworks (CHFs) by topologically assembling heptazine and benzene-containing molecular units that provide active sites for hydrogen and oxygen evolution reactions, respectively. Among them, 12 CHFs have band gap values of <3.0 eV with band margins straddling the chemical reaction potential of H-2/H+ and O-2/H2O. In particular, a 2D H@DBTD CHF based on heptazine and 4,7-diphenyl-2,1,3-benzothiadiazole is a potential photocatalyst with a band gap of 2.47 eV for overall water splitting, which was confirmed with the calculated Gibbs free energy, non-adiabatic molecular dynamics, and preliminary experiment.

To understand how life interacts with its environment requires monitoring interactions with H2O and O-2 not only at timescales relevant to organismal growth but also over billions of years of geobiological evolution. Chemical transformations intrinsic to evolution and development were characterized by analyzing data from recent phylostratigraphic and proteomic studies. This two-stage analysis involves obtaining chemical metrics (carbon oxidation state and stoichiometric hydration state) from the elemental compositions of proteins followed by modeling the relative stabilities of target proteins against a proteomic background to infer thermodynamic parameters [oxygen fugacity, water activity, and virtual redox potential (Eh)]. The main results of this study are a rise in carbon oxidation state of proteins spanning the time of the Great Oxidation Event, a rise in virtual redox potential that coincides with the likely emergence of aerobic metabolism, and a rise in carbon oxidation state of proteins inferred from the transcriptome in late stages of Bacillus subtilis biofilm growth. Furthermore, stoichiometric hydration state of expressed proteins decreases through stages of biofilm development, drops at the same time as a drop in organismal water content during fruit fly development, and is lower for proteins with more recent gene ages, all of which support the inference of higher hydration potentials at earlier time points. These results show how the evolutionary and developmental dynamics of major chemical variables can be deciphered through thermodynamic analysis of proteins as chemical entities.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0022-2844	1432-1432		WOS:000768426800001	35279735

Electrochemical production of hydrogen based on water splitting has been deliberated as an auspicious approach, however, the lethargic anodic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) restricts the effectiveness of water splitting. Also, active catalysts for catalytic reduction of organic pollutants are also highly required for the catalytic removal of organic pollutants. Therefore, in this manuscript, we report iron doped metal oxide nanocomposites (Fe2O3-ZnO and Fe-SnO2) as multifunctional catalysts for OER, hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) as well as catalytic reduction of organic pollutants. Therefore, efficient nano-catalyst based on iron oxide doped tin oxides and iron doped zinc oxide with long-term stability and efficient hydrogen generation and removal of organic pollutants has been developed. The catalytic efficiency of the developed materials was evaluated toward producing hydrogen and removing organic pollutants. In HER, it was found that Fe2O3-ZnO and Fe-SnO2 needs a low over potential to produce 10 mA cm(-2) in 0.5 M KOH and 0.5 M H2SO4. Similarly, in OER, 600 mV is needed to drive the current density of 20 mA cm(-2) in 1.0 M KOH using Fe2O3-ZnO. Fe2O3-ZnO illustrates lower Tafel slopes of 64.3 mV dec(-1) and 96.0 mV dec(-1) in HER using 0.5 M KOH and 0.5 M H2SO4, respectively, while in OER, the Tafel slope is 76.5 mV dec(-1) using 1.0 M KOH. The catalytic efficiency of Fe2O3-ZnO and Fe-SnO2 was also evaluated for the removal of 4-nitrophenol and among them, Fe-SnO2 displayed good catalytic efficiency toward 4-nitrophenol reduction. 4-Nitrophenol was totally reduced in less than 5 min using Fe-SnO2 as a catalyst.									8	0	0	0	3	0	8			0927-7757	1873-4359		WOS:000596329800001

The interplay between the phase formation sequence in the powders and the microstructural evolution in the consolidated samples is described. It is shown that. the glassy SiO2 phase characteristic of conventional powder processed MoSi2 can be effectively eliminated by combining mechanical alloying, carbon additions, and an in situ carbothermal reduction reaction. Using this approach, composites consisting of uniformly distributed micron-size SiC in an MoSi2 matrix can be formed. The effect of important processing variables such as the extent of carbon additions, extraneous iron pickup during MA, partial pressures of oxygen, consolidation temperatures, and consolidation atmospheres is discussed based on the evidence obtained from DTA, TGA, TEM, and XRD.									47	2	0	0	0	0	49			0884-2914			WOS:A1993LE82800033

Herein, a simple one-pot solvothermal method has been developed to synthesize a hybrid material of nickel@nickel carbide (Ni@Ni3C) nanochain embedded in a network of single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs). The electrochemical experiments indicate that the composite of Ni@Ni3C-SWCNTs has the HER electrocatalytic performance comparable to that of Pt/C in an acidic medium (0.5 M H2SO4). The overpotential to reach a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) in 0.5 M H2SO4 is only -74 mV with a Tafel slope of 46.9 mV dec(-1). Compared to Ni@Ni3C in the absence of SWCNTs, the enhanced HER performance of Ni@Ni3C-SWCNTs can be attributed to the increased intrinsic activity, improved electronic conductivity, and the electron coupling effect between Ni@Ni3C and SWCNTs. The Ni@Ni3C-SWCNTs composites also show high stability at the overpotential of -0.2 V for 24 h. This work provides guidance for the synthesis of high-performance non-precious metal electrocatalysts for HER.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0013-4651	1945-7111		WOS:000588360600001

Studies by steady-state fluorescence and UV-visible spectroscopies show that a supramolecular dyad is formed by fullerene-based pyridine (C-60-py) and the zinc porphyrin via a coordination bond, with a binding constant K of 1.18 x 10(5) M-1. The photoexcitation of ZnP-Pr-tpy causes the ground state electrons of the tpy moiety to shift to the ZnP unit via an electron-exchange process following the Dexter energy transfer mechanism. Thus, a donor-acceptor composite film, ZnP-Pr-tpy/C-60-py, was fabricated by combining the photosensitizer ZnP-Pr-tpy with C-60-py. A comparison of the over-potential at 10 mA/cm(2), the Tafel slopes and the photocurrent response under visible light irradiation showed the electrocatalytic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and the photocurrent response to be clearly improved by the covalent modification of the porphyrin with terpyridine, and further improved by the axial coordination of C-60-py to ZnP-Pr-tpy. These improvements are attributed to increased intra- and intermolecular electron transfer, the decrease in the electrochemical impedance resulting from the axial coordination of C-60-py to ZnP-Pr-tpy and the electron-exchange in ZnP-Pr-tpy through the Dexter energy transfer mechanism under light excitation.

In this paper, a novel and very specific method has been proposed to solve the above problem. The side reactions, which are always regarded as negative factors, are promoted at negative side to balance the side reactions at positive side. A novel electrode with high reaction area and well mass transport structure has been designed to facilitate parasitic reactions at negative side. The result shows that zinc accumulation has been successfully solved by balancing positive reactions and negative reactions with this novel electrode, and no zinc accumulates on the negative electrode over 400 cycles. This paper provides an effective way to improve the cycling stability of ZNBs, which is the most troublesome for the commercialization of ZNBs. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Evolution of the system was monitored potentiometrically. Simultaneous recordings of gaseous oxygen over the reaction solution were also performed. In separate experiments the iodine concentration was monitored spectrophotometrically. Replacement of H2O by D2O progressively intensifies the reactions of oxidation of the iodine species, compared to the reactions of their reduction. As a result there is a critical ratio of D2O/H2O, after which the dynamics of the system is considerably altered. The same effect is observed at all temperatures, but it is more pronounced at lower temperatures. Two possible explanations for the progressively intensified oxidation are discussed: the reverse isotope effect and the selective energy transfer. It is established that the oxidation and reduction of the iodine species in the BL reaction do not proceed through the same intermediates. The important role of bulk water in surmounting the high activation energy threshold of the oxidation branch is revealed in the experiments.									23	0	1	0	0	0	23			1089-5639	1520-5215		WOS:000075744300002

The past few years have been particularly exciting because the structural era of the plant photosystem II has begun. Although the atomic structure has yet to be determined, the map obtained at 6 A resolution by electron crystallography allows assignment of the key reaction center subunits with their associated pigment molecules. In the following, we first review the structural details that have recently emerged and then discuss the primary and secondary photochemical reaction pathways. Finally, in an attempt to establish the evolutionary link between the oxygenic and the anoxygenic photosynthesis, a framework structure common to all photosynthetic reaction centers has been defined, and the implications have been described.									30	2	0	0	22	0	32			1056-8700			WOS:000169531600014	11340062

Scientists worldwide are engaged in developing various technologies related to hydrogen energy exploitation and conversion, such as photocatalytic/electrocatalytic water splitting, fuel cells, and so on. Electrocatalytic water splitting using electric energy can produce clean and pure hydrogen from water on a large scale, which can be further directly converted into electric energy by fuel cells. This environmentally friendly system relies on a series of important reactions, especially the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), which both require high efficiency and durable electrocatalysts. Despite the tremendous efforts of the scientific community, electrocatalysts with satisfactory performance are still lacking. At the heart of electrocatalysts, active sites are key to catalytic performance. Active site engineering, by tuning the nature of the active sites in the electrocatalysts, offers an important opportunity to improve the performance of electrocatalysts. Typically, the strategies for active site engineering involve (1) tailoring the environment around the active sites and (2) engineering the structure of the active sites. These approaches can be used to optimize the electronic properties of the active sites, balance the binding energies between the active sites and the reactants/intermediates/products, and thus accelerate the overall reaction processes.In this Account, we summarize the recent progress made in our laboratory on active site engineering in transition metal based electrocatalysts for green energy applications. We start with metal nanoparticle electrocatalysts, engineering Ru nanoparticles on different supports, to achieve more efficient electrocatalytic HER performance. Next, after we theoretically predicted that the hydrogen adsorption/desorption on iridium (Ir) sites could be balanced by environmental carbon/nitrogen atoms, we anchored Ir nanoparticles on the nitrogenated carbon supports, accelerating the acidic hydrogen evolution catalysis. In subsequent sections, we present how engineering active sites with different structures in metal single atom electrocatalysts achieved enhanced oxygen reduction catalysis. We also demonstrate that active site engineering in metal carbide/phosphide electrocatalysts with defects, surface atomic arrangements and heteroatoms can also improve the catalytic activities of the active sites. This Account highlights the engineering of efficient active sites in transition metal based electrocatalysts using robust strategies, which may offer new opportunities for the rational design and synthesis of efficient electrocatalysts for various energy applications.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5				2643-6728		WOS:000651110500004

EBI was employed as a tool to generate radicals, which induced a "cold" stabilization reaction at room temperature and excluded ionic and thermally induced radical-mediated stabilization reactions. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy was employed to quantitatively track the structural evolution of the PAI during stabilization. The stabilization reactions of the PAIs successfully progressed with higher EBI dosages at room temperature. More efficient cyclization reactions were observed for the PAIs with increased amounts of IA, because of the increased amorphous regions of the PAIs with a higher level of IA. The extents of the cyclization values of the PAIs normalized to their crystallinity values were similar to each other regardless of the IA contents, indicating the absence of an ionic initiation mechanism of IA at room temperature. In addition, the incorporation of IA units in PAIs increased the polarity and oxophilicity of the PAIs, thereby inducing facilitated oxygen uptake reactions, as evidenced by the high concentrations of conjugated carbonyl groups in the stabilized structures.

Two configurations are realized allowing the investigation of both the electrochemical and electrocatalytical behavior of a thin Pt layer on yttria stabilized zirconia (YSZ). We can readily select the atmosphere down to 10(-6) Pa partial pressure and determine the response of the system in less than 1 s. Under HV conditions, YSZ appears electrochemically active and we have identified, in the cathodic potential domain, the reduction/oxidation process of zirconia and in the anodic domain, the platinum oxidation/reduction and the oxygen evolution reactions. In a catalytic active gas mixture, despite the Faradaic enhancement of the CO oxidation observed over Pt/YSZ during an anodic polarization, an intriguing sustainable enhanced Pt/YSZ catalyst activity is achieved after current interruption.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			0021-891X			WOS:000281970900023

The application of multiple reaction mechanisms on coal oxidation was analysed. The two-step reactions were determined for multi-step reaction mechanism by analysing mass loss rate characteristics, gaseous products concentration, and kinetic parameters. The key temperatures with standard deviations (maximum mass temperature, ignition temperature, and burnout temperature) under 10 degrees C/min were 315.7 +/- 0.3, 471.2 +/- 0.2, and 631.2 +/- 1.1 degrees C. The equivalent chemical expression of coal was C64.2H43O7.1 based upon proximate and elemental analyses. According to TG-FTIR and TG-GC/TCD results, the CO2 (2337 cm(-1)) and CO (2097 cm(-1)) can be generated by carboxyl and aldehyde group respectively. Specially, the generation amount of CO2 and CO increased rapidly after 417 degrees C and the maximum values appeared at 526 degrees C at 10 degrees C/min. The activation energy calculated by two isoconversional methods lied in 63.4 +/- 0.1 to 133.37 +/- 0.1 kJ/mol. The deviation equation was proposed in view of same effect (gamma = 0.5) on simulation results for mass and mass loss rate. Kinetic triplets of coal reaction were computed using differential evolution algorithm. The average deviation was decreased by 2.06% by utilising two-step reaction mechanisms.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0016-2361	1873-7153		WOS:000839031200004

Herein, the porous hierarchical hetero-(Ni3-xFex)FeN/Ni catalysts are in situ constructed for the efficient electrocatalytic OER. X-ray absorption fine structure characterizations reveal the strong Ni-Fe bimetallic interaction in (Ni3-xFex)FeN/Ni. Theoretical study indicates the heterojunction and bimetallic interaction decrease the free-energy change for the rate-limiting step of the OER and the overpotential thereof. In addition, the high conductivity and porous hierarchical morphology favor the electron transfer, electrolyte access and O-2 release. Consequently, the optimized catalyst achieves a low overpotential of 223 mV at 10 mA center dot cm(-2), a small Tafel slope of 68 mV center dot dec(-1), and a high stability. The excellent performance of the optimized catalyst is also demonstrated by the overall water electrolysis with a low working voltage and high Faradaic efficiency. Moreover, the correlation between the structure and performance is well established by the experimental characterizations and theoretical calculations, which confirms the origin of the OER activity from the surface metal oxyhydroxide in situ generated upon applying the current.

Herein, hybridization of three bimetallic phosphides, nickel-molybdenum (Ni-Mo), cobalt-molybdenum (Co-Mo), and cobalt-nickel (Co-Ni), in single ultrathin-3D-nanosheets on nickel foam (NMCP@NF) was carried out to fabricate an active and robust trimetallic metal-phosphide electrocatalyst for overall electrochemical water splitting. Simple hydrothermal synthesis followed by chemical vapor deposition-based phosphorization was used to fabricate the present catalyst. By using the optimum stoichiometric ratios of metals precursors, NMCP@NF nanosheets were achieved with the best electrical conductivity and high electrochemically active sites, resulting in high electrocatalytic activities with excellent kinetics for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The NMCP@NF exhibited a low overpotential of 88 mV at 10 mA cm-2 for HER and a low overpotential of 250 mV at 10 mA cm-2 for OER. The NMCP@NF (+, -) device required a cell voltage of 1.52 V to reach a current density of 10 mA cm-2 in an alkaline electrolytic solution. The present study demonstrated that NMCP@NF as the best transition metal phosphide for overall water splitting. All rights reserved Elsevier.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			1879-1069			INSPEC:21889162		
J	Torri, L.; Piergiovanni, L.; Limbo, S.								DEGRADATION OF beta-CAROTENE IN AN AQUEOUS MEDIUM EXPOSED TO FLUORESCENT AND HALOGEN LIGHTS UNDER DIFFERENT OXYGEN PARTIAL PRESSURES								ITALIAN JOURNAL OF FOOD SCIENCE				19		SI		62	67						2007	2007	During distribution and at retail level, transparent packages are exposed to natural and artificial light which may impair food quality and marketability, due to the photosensitivity of the product. The aim of this work was to study the influence of different light sources and various oxygen partial pressures on the degradation rate of beta-carotene in aqueous medium. Firstly, a survey of the light sources used in commercial display areas was performed in order to investigate the most common conditions of illumination. As a function of the obtained results, three types of light (a cool white, a warm white and a halogen lamp) were chosen for the experimental phase. An aqueous solution of beta-carotene was closed in clear glass vials and stored under various conditions of lighting and oxygen partial pressure. The pigment photodegradation was monitored in terms of beta-carotene concentration and colour evolution. The pigment degradation was correlated to illuminance and UVA irradiance values of the selected lamps. In particular, the fluorescent lamps caused a degradation higher than the halogen lamp because of the emission on the blue region of the spectrum, where beta-carotene absorbs. Lighting was a critical variable also in the presence of a low oxygen partial pressure (5 kPa) and even if more slowly than at 20 kPa of O-2, the beta-carotene degradated completely during storage.									0	0	0	0	1	0	1			1120-1770	2239-5687		WOS:000208675300011

TGA/DSC and BET analyses showed that the synthesis of NiO and NiMoO4 involved an intense exothermic combustion reaction that resulted in high surface area nanomaterials, with large pore volume and small pore size. XRD confirmed the phase composition and crystallite size of the synthesized materials. The particle size range was 20-40 nm for NiMoO4 and NiO, and 200-350 nm for MoO3. Band gap values of 3.44, 3.13, and 3.18 eV were determined for NiO, MoO3, and NiMoO4, respectively. Raman spectroscopy provided structural information about the synthesized materials, while FTIR results revealed that agar acts as both a metalion chelating agent and fuel. XPS confirmed the valence states of the produced materials and purported their purity, while the zeta potential measurements underpinned the stability of the samples in aqueous media. The synthesized materials were tested as potential electrocatalysts in water electrolysis for the oxygen (OER) and the hydrogen evolution reactions (HER) in an alkaline medium. The results demonstrated that NiMoO4 exhibits an excellent electrocatalytic activity in both OER and HER.									31	0	0	0	1	0	31			0254-0584	1879-3312		WOS:000574885000002

Two fundamental reactions, hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER), are involved, and cost-effective catalysts are required to fulfill the energy transfer process. Nonprecious-metal catalysts have been proposed as the mainstay for future commercial applications. Among them, iron-nickel (FeNi)based catalysts are very promising benefiting from the FeNi synergistic interaction in promoting the basic reactions. With the help of rational structure design, composition optimization, and electronic state tuning, advanced catalysts based on FeNi have been extensively reported. Herein, we focus on the varied FeNi-based catalysts for water splitting reactions. Before reviewing the literature, some descriptors and perspective comments are first given in the parameter evaluation part that might be helpful for understating the catalytic capability. In light of the extensive reports, some typical examples of FeNi-based catalysts classified into FeNi-alloy, phosphides, oxides, layered double hydroxides, sulfides, tellurides, selenides, and fluorides are introduced in detail. Combined with these advanced catalysts and the performance evaluation, this review will be helpful for readers in understanding the advanced progress on FeNi-based catalysts for water splitting reaction. Problems and challenges are also discussed demonstrating that efficient catalysts that can maintain high activity and stability are still highly desired. A brief perspective on FeNi-based catalysts is proposed that we hope can be a good complement to the existing literature for a better understanding of FeNi-based catalysts for water splitting reaction.									77	1	0	0	7	0	77			0887-0624	1520-5029		WOS:000592961700017		
J	Fang, Chunyao; Wang, Xian; Zhang, Qiang; Zhou, Jianyang								First-Principles Calculations on Semiconducting epsilon-GeS and epsilon-SnS Monolayer Nanosheets with Photocatalytic Activity for Sunlight-Driven Water Splitting								ACS APPLIED NANO MATERIALS				5	3			3900	3912		10.1021/acsanm.1c04495				MAR 25 2022	2022	The design of two-dimensional (2D) ultrathin nanosheets with favorable electronic and optic properties that can satisfy the essential requirements of photocatalytic water splitting remains a challenge. Anisotropic Janus 2D materials exhibit fascinating potential due to their excellent photocatalytic performance, yet the scarcity of such materials limits their wide application. Herein, an allotrope of GeS and SnS monolayers with a epsilon-phosphorene-like atomic arrangement (epsilon-GeS and epsilon-SnS monolayers) is predicted to be a promising electrocatalyst for photocatalytic water splitting by first-principles calculations, and the results attest to its good stabilities. Both Janus monolayers prove to be semiconducting with direct band gaps of 2.63 eV for epsilon-GeS and 2.41 eV for epsilon-SnS, straddling the redox potentials of water. HSE calculations reveal that both GeS and SnS allotropes display notable anisotropy along with high hole mobility (similar to 10(3) cm(2) V-1 s(-1)). Moreover, both monolayers present strong optical absorption in the visible-light excitation range (10(5) cm(-1)), thus ensuring efficient harvesting for solar energy. Particularly, spontaneous hydrogen (HER) and oxygen evolution (OER) half reactions can occur simultaneously, driven only by sunlight-induced carriers, which still work even under strain. More interestingly, after transition-metal atom (from Sc to Zn) decoration, Co/epsilon-GeS and Sc/epsilon-SnS are confirmed as the most efficient single-atom HER catalysts, capable of driving HER with low overpotentials of 0.02 and -0.05 V, respectively, even outperforming the commercial Pt catalyst (-0.09 V). Meanwhile, for OER, low-overpotential Ni/epsilon-SnS (0.42 V) proves to be better than the generally used IrO2 catalyst (0.55 V).									2	0	0	0	0	0	2				2574-0970		WOS:000800286500077

It was found that the presence of air (oxygen and nitrogen) accelerates the nanocrystallization reaction, but has no influence on the amorphous phase formation during ball milling. The mechanochemical work necessary to obtain a certain degree of amorphization or nanocrystallization in the Mg2Ni-based alloys was determined and it was found to control the end product of milling.

In this review, various spinels with controlled preparations and their applications in oxygen reduction/evolution reaction (ORR/OER) and beyond are summarized. First, the composition and structure of spinels are introduced. Then, recent advances in the preparation of spinels with solid-, solution-, and vapor-phase methods are summarized, and new methods are particularly highlighted. The physicochemical characteristics of spinels such as their compositions, structures, morphologies, defects, and substrates have been rationally regulated through various approaches. This regulation can yield spinels with improved ORR/OER catalytic activities, which can further accelerate the speed, prolong the life, and narrow the polarization of fuel cells, metal air batteries, and water splitting devices. Finally, the magnetic, optical, electrical, and catalytic applications beyond the OER/ORR are also discussed. The future applications of spinels are considered to be closely related to environmental and energy issues, which will be aided by the development of new species with precise preparations and advanced characterizations.,									789	35	1	0	42	0	797			0009-2665	1520-6890		WOS:000407540500006	28745484

Here, the design and fabrication of a stand-alone ion exchange material-embedded, Si membrane-based, photoelectrochemical cell architecture with micron-sized pores is shown, to overcome the i) pH gradient formation due to long-distance ion transport, ii) product crossover, and iii) parasitic light absorption by application of a patterned catalyst. The membrane-embedded PEC cell with micropores utilizes a triple Si junction cell as the light absorber, and Pt and IrOx as electrocatalysts for the hydrogen evolution reactions and oxygen evolution reactions, respectively. The solar-to-hydrogen efficiency of 7% at steady-state operation, as compared to an unpatterned (PV) of 10.8%, is mainly attributed to absorption losses by the incorporation of the micropores and catalyst microdots. The introduction of the Nafion ion exchange material ensures an intrinsically safe PEC cell, by reducing the total gas crossover to <0.1%, while without a cation exchange membrane, a crossover of >6% is observed. Only in a pure electrolyte of 1 m H2SO4, a pH gradient-free system is observed thus completely avoiding the build-up of a counteracting potential.									10	0	0	0	0	0	10			1614-6832	1614-6840		WOS:000471339300002

Involvement of Lysine 48 in Protonation								JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN CHEMICAL SOCIETY				134	11			5120	5130		10.1021/ja209297n				MAR 21 2012	2012	Superoxide reductase is a nonheme iron metalloenzyme that detoxifies superoxide anion radicals O-2(center dot-) in some microorganisms. Its catalytic mechanism was previously proposed to involve a single ferric iron (hydro)peroxo intermediate, which is protonated to form the reaction product H2O2. Here, we show by pulse radiolysis that the mutation of the well-conserved lysine 48 into isoleucine in the SOR from Desulfoarculus baarsii dramatically affects its reaction with O-2(center dot-). Although the first reaction intermediate and its decay are not affected by the mutation, H2O2 is no longer the reaction product. In addition, in contrast to the wild-type SOR, the lysine mutant catalyzes a two-electron oxidation of an olefin into epoxide in the presence of H2O2, suggesting the formation of iron-oxo intermediate species in this mutant. In agreement with the recent X-ray structures of the peroxide intermediates trapped in a SOR crystal, these data support the involvement of lysine 48 in the specific protonation of the proximal oxygen of the peroxide intermediate to generate H2O2, thus avoiding formation of iron-oxo species, as is observed in cytochrome P450. In addition, we proposed that the first reaction intermediate observed by pulse radiolysis is a ferrous-iron superoxo species, in agreement with TD-DFT calculations of the absorption spectrum of this intermediate. A new reaction scheme for the catalytical mechanism of SOR with O-2(center dot-) is presented in which ferrous iron-superoxo and ferric hydroperoxide species are reaction intermediates, and the lysine 48 plays a key role in the control of the evolution of iron peroxide intermediate to form H2O2.									23	0	0	0	12	0	23			0002-7863			WOS:000302191900025	22360372

However, for application in catalysis for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), protection against oxidative corrosion, a high surface area with facile electrolyte access, and control over the exposed active surface sites are highly desirable. This study concerns a new method for the synthesis of porous tungsten carbide films with template-controlled porosity that are surface-modified with thin layers of nickel oxide (NiO) to obtain active and stable OER catalysts. The method relies on the synthesis of soft-templated mesoporous tungsten oxide (mp. WOx) films, a pseudomorphic transformation into mesoporous tungsten carbide (mp. WCx), and a subsequent shape-conformal deposition of finely dispersed NiO species by atomic layer deposition (ALD). As theoretically predicted by density functional theory (DFT) calculations, the highly conductive carbide support promotes the conversion of Ni2+ into Ni3+, leading to remarkably improved utilization of OER-active sites in alkaline medium. The obtained Ni mass-specific activity is about 280 times that of mesoporous NiOx (mp. NiOx) films. The NiO-coated WCx catalyst achieves an outstanding mass-specific activity of 1989 A g(Ni)(-1) in a rotating-disc electrode (RDE) setup at 25 degrees C using 0.1 m KOH as the electrolyte.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			1864-5631	1864-564X		WOS:000695452100001	34498408

Herein, we systematically designed Fe-Co-Ni trimetallic nanoalloys encapsulated in nitrogen-doped carbon nanotube@nanosheet frameworks (FeCoNi-NC) for application as effective bifunctional ORR/OER electrocatalysts. The rational structural design of FeCoNi-NC provides hierarchical porosity coupled with greatly increased effective electrochemical specific area for exposing abundant active sites and enhanced mass-transfer capability toward the ORR/OER. Experimental observations and theoretical calculations confirmed that Fe-Co-Ni nanoalloys interacting with pyridinic nitrogen-rich carbon synergistically optimized the adsorption/desorption free energies of oxygen intermediates, thus significantly enhancing the intrinsic ORR/OER activity. Consequently, FeCoNi-NC exhibits remarkable bifunctionality for the ORR (half-wave potential of 0.89 V) and OER (1.54 V at 10 mA cm(-2)) with Delta E = 0.65 V, and even outperforms Pt/C-RuO2 benchmarks. Moreover, the corresponding zinc-air battery shows large power density (315.2 mW cm(-2)), high capacity (803.78 mA h g(-1) at 100 mA cm(-2)) and excellent cycling durability (over 100 hours at 50 mA cm(-2)), further testifying its practical applications. This work demonstrates an effective pathway to highly active non-precious-metal bifunctional catalysts toward sustainable energy technologies.									38	0	0	0	1	0	38			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000601282900032

Herein, we report the growth of NiFe LDH in the form of fine nanosheets in a single step using benzyl alcohol-mediated chemistry. The electrochemical studies clearly suggest that benzyl alcohol is capable of inducing effective chemical interaction between Ni and Fe in the NiFe LDH. The overpotential to produce benchmark 10 mA cm-2 (h10) for the NiFe LDH electrode is only ~270 mVRHE, which is much smaller than those of benchmark IrO2 (h10 = 318 mVRHE), nickel hydroxide (h10 = 370 mVRHE) and iron hydroxide (h10 = 410 mVRHE) for the OER. The difference of the overpotential requirement increases further with increasing current density, indicating faster kinetics of the OER at the catalytic interface of the NiFe LDH. Estimation of Tafel values verifies this notion - the Tafel slopes of NiFe LDH, Ni(OH)2, and FeOOH are calculated to be 48.6, 55.8, and 59.3 mV dec-1, respectively. At h = 270 mV, the turnover frequency (TOF) of the NiFe LDH is 0.48 s-1, which is ~8 and ~11 folds higher than those of Ni(OH)2 (0.059 s-1) and FeOOH (0.042 s-1). In addition to Tafel and TOF, the NiFe LDH electrode has favorable electrochemically active surface area and electrochemical impedance. The electrochemical stability of the NiFe LDH electrode is assessed by conducting potentiostatic measurements at h = 270 mVRHE (-10 mA cm-2) and at h = 355 mVRHE (-30 mA cm-2) for 24 h of continuous oxygen production.(c) 2022 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC.

We present here a category of alloyed PtNix electrocatalysts by a facile green chemical reduction method, which are used to catalyze HER during seawater splitting. The catalytic performances are optimized by tuning stoichiometric Pt/Ni ratio, yielding a maximized catalytic behavior for PtNi5 electrode. The minimized onset potential is as low as -0.38 V and the corresponding Tafel slope is 119 mV dec(-1). Moreover, the launched alloy electrodes have remarkable stability at -1.2 V over 12 h. The high efficiency as well as good durability demonstrates the PtNix electrocatalysts to be promising in practical applications. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

This is particularly important to address the slow oxygen evolution reaction (OER) kinetics and hence can contribute to the conversion and storage of sustainable energy. In this study, the deposition of crystalline flowerlike 2D nanosheets of nickel molybdate (NiMoO4) directly on nickel foam (NF) through an aerosol-assisted chemical vapor deposition process is reported. The NiMoO4 nanosheets were developed on NF by altering the deposition time for 60 and 120 min at a fixed temperature of 480 degrees C. The structural determination by XRD and XPS analyses revealed a highly crystalline single phase NiMoO4. The micrographs of NiMoO4 show that the surface consisted of vertically aligned 2D nanosheets assembled into flowerlike structures. The nanosheets produced after 60 min deposition time on a network of NF is found to perform better for OER as compared to the one developed for 120 min. A reference current density of 10 mA cm(-2) was achieved at an overpotential (eta) of 320 mV, which was better as compared to that reported for the benchmark OER catalyst in 1.0 M KOH. Moreover, a small Tafel value (75 mV dec(-1)) and good OER stability for >15 h were also observed.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			2470-1343			WOS:000754397700050	34841177

Subsequently, nanoporous NiO was obtained via heating treatment, the macropore and skeleton sizes of the NiO originated from Ni10Al90 alloy are 100-300 nm and 80-200 nm, respectively. Benefiting from the multi-stage nanoporous structure and high specific surface area, the nanoporous NiO demonstrates an outstanding OER, reaching 20 mA cm(-2) at an overpotential of 356 mV in 1 M KOH. The corresponding Tafel slope and apparent activation energy are measured to be 76.73 mV dec(-1) and 29.0 kJ mol(-1), respectively. Moreover, kinetic analysis indicates that the NiO catalyst shows pseudocapacitive characteristics, and the improved current is attributed to the high-rate pseudocapacitive behavior that efficiently maintains increased nickel redox cycling to accelerate the reaction rates. After 10 0 0 cycles of voltammetry, the overpotential of the NiO decreases by 22 mV (j = 10 mA cm(-2)), exhibiting excellent stability and durability.

The present study establishes a new, highly efficient mathematical model for a solid-state lithium-oxygen battery, which utilizes a porous Li1.3Al0.3Ti1.7(PO4)(3) (LATP) solid electrolyte sheet as the cathode. The study includes and considers the transport of lithium ions and oxygen molecules, the kinetic equation of electrochemical reaction, and the charge conservation equation. The active surface area of the cathode is calculated by the binary particle mixed percolation theory, and a product growth model is proposed to describe the active surface's evolution. Validated by experimental data, the model can predict both the voltage specific capacity curves under different currents and the electrode behavior of discharge. The results show that the initial cathode active surface area and battery capacity are sensitive to such factors as LATP particle radius, LATP volume fraction, and carbon particle radius. It is concluded that the discharge product in solid-state lithium-oxygen battery has more uniformly distributed, which aids in oxygen diffusion and a longer discharge process.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3				2352-152X		WOS:000735304000003

The highest and lowest ORR (specific and mass) activities among the tested electrocatalysts were exhibited by LSC and LSF, respectively. Increasing Co content and at the same time decreasing Fe content in the LSCF composition, resulted in ORR specific activity enhancement as well as in an increase in the number of transferred electrons, from ca. 2 (for LSF) to ca. 4 (for LSC), implying a change in the ORR mechanism. The observed change in ORR activity of the perovskite/C electrocatalysts upon gradual substitution of iron by cobalt was associated with induced changes in the surface B-sites electronic structure and in surface oxygen vacancy formation.									42	1	0	0	4	1	43			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000457952600023

However, their potentials for biological catalysis have seldom been explored. Herein, we investigated the enzyme-like properties of four TMPs (FeP, CoP, Ni2P, and Cu3P) towards two sugar-related reactions. Among the four TMPs, Cu3P nanoparticles (NPs) efficiently catalyzed the hydrolysis of glycosidic bonds as glycoside hydrolase mimics, and FeP NPs possessed both glucose oxidase-like (GOx-like) and peroxidase-like activities, which combined into a cascade reaction for glucose's simple and one-step colorimetric biosensor without GOx. Cu3P and FeP NPs with distinctive enzyme-like activities have shown unique biological catalysis potentials for further applications with an attractive and challenging goal of developing nanomaterials to mimic natural enzymes, which encourages more efforts to reveal TMP's capabilities towards biocatalysis.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1998-0124	1998-0000		WOS:000827346200001

In the preparations depleted of the 24 x 10(3) and 16 x 10(3) polypeptides by washing with 1 M NaCl, approximately 55 % of the centres were still operative and no significant changes in either the misses and double hits parameters, S-state turnover time and stability of the centres were observed. DLE kinetics confirmed that the PS2 donor side was not affected. Urea plus NaCl washing released the 33 x 10(3) peripheral protein in parallel with significant changes in DLE kinetics, reflecting an inhibition on the PS2 donor side and a delayed recombination of separated P680+Q- charges. The depleted membranes showed a considerable depression of the O2 flash yields. The biphasic kinetics of the deactivation reactions of the S2 and S3 oxidized states were delayed (the absence of the 33 x X 10(3) protein increases the stability of the states). The 33 x 10(3) polypeptide is essential for preservation of the oxygen evolving capacity of the PS2 complexes.									1	0	0	0	2	0	2			0300-3604			WOS:A1991JM84300009

Nevertheless when subjected to both high temperature and aggressive oxidizing environment, due to phase transformation, a chemical strain appears that leads to additional stresses in industrial parts and may cause degradation. In this paper, macroscopic constitutive equations are proposed to model the complex relationship between stress, strain, temperature and oxidizing atmosphere in porous SiC-RC. To model the kinetics of the chemical swelling, oxygen content in the porosity of the heterogeneous material is estimated. It depends on both the oxidation reaction of SiC-based grains and the diffusion of oxygen through the connected porosity in the castable. The macroscopic chemical strain associated to the local SiO2 formation takes only place when the local small voids cannot absorb the reaction product anymore. Besides, the reduction of porosity is accompanied by a reduction in the gas permeability and consequently a reduction in the diffusion of oxygen.The multi-physical model is implemented in the finite element code Abaqus. It accounts for heat transfer,reactive oxygen transport and chemically induced strain. A validation test was carried out on a cylindrical sample subjected to high temperature with a thermal gradient in ambient air. Comparison between experimental results, microscopic observations and numerical results showed that the model provides a good description of the main physical phenomena. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Various nitrogen-containing compounds (aliphatic and aromatic amines, aminoalcohols, aminoacids) were used as the ligands. In both cases, products of ligand transformation have been observed, products of the transformations have been identified by GLC-MS. In case of the CCl4 addition, the reaction can be initiated by the either copper complex or the ligand. In case of the thiol coupling, the reaction proceeds as a conjugated oxidation of both the thiol and the ligand.

The samples were characterized by Raman spectroscopy, transmission electron microscopy and tested using a Kelvin probe to measure the work function changes upon oxygen adsorption at different temperatures. The same materials were evaluated as electrocatalysts for the oxygen reduction reactivity under acid conditions, in a three-electrode configuration, in a rotating disc electrode setup. Since both Kelvin probe work function measurements and rotating disc electrode measurements provide the sample averaged surface properties, the correlation of results from these two techniques can be useful for the understanding of the catalysts' performance. A striking correlation between the electrocatalytic activity with the material's ability to activate molecular oxygen was observed. The obtained results were rationalized in terms of electronic interaction between the supporting carbon material, and a metallic component. (C) 2019 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC.

The oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is the rate-determine step of water electrolysis. The exploring of low-cost, highly efficient and durable electrocatalysts for OER is thus extremely important. In this work, we developed a facile two-phase protocol to fabricate an alpha-Co(OH)(2) using sodium oleate as the phase-transfer surfactant. The crystallinity and structure of the alpha-Co(OH)(2) was regulated by heat treatments toward enhanced electrocatalytic OER activity. With the calcination of the as-prepared alpha-Co(OH)(2) at 200 degrees C, a networked and well-dispersed CoO nanoparticles were formed. The CoO sample afforded an OER current density of 10 mA cm(-2) under a low overpotential of 312 mV in a 1 mol L-1 KOH aqueous solution. The high activity of the CoO material is believed to be associated with its ultra-small particle size and plentiful open spaces in the material, both of which can provide abundant surface catalytic sites.

In this context, synergistic coupling between Ni/Co-based materials with transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) often accelerates the alkaline hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Significant interaction between the two components and active-site density are the keys for achieving a promising catalytic activity. This report emphasizes a two-step selenization approach to prepare a Ni0.85Se/MoSe2 interfacial structure with abundant active sites. Initially, Ni0.75Se nanoparticles were prepared using the solvothermal method and subsequently employed them as a support for the growth of MoSe2 under hydrothermal conditions. This resulted in the formation of a Ni0.85Se/MoSe2 interfacial structure. The results of physical characterization techniques confirm the significant interaction between Ni0.85Se and MoSe2. The interfacial structures showed a superior HER activity in alkali media compared to the individual components; especially, Ni0.85Se/MoSe2 (20) delivers a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at an overpotential of 108 mV. The improved HER activity of the interfacial structure is attributed to the (i) efficient water dissociation process over the Ni0.85Se promoter and (ii) exposure of more catalytic active sites (edges) of MoSe2. In addition, as-prepared Ni0.75Se exhibits a better oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity by delivering a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at an overpotential of 340 mV. Furthermore, overall water splitting has been demonstrated by constructing an electrolyzer using Ni0.85Se/MoSe2 (20) and Ni1.75Se as a cathode and anode, respectively. The electrolyzer delivers a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at a cell potential of 1.7 V. The long-term stability experiment and the post catalytic characterization reveals the high robustness of the Ni0.85Se/MoSe2 interfacial structure.									17	0	0	0	1	0	17			2574-0962			WOS:000636714000087

AbstractAn in situ coupling strategy to prepare Co9S8/S and N dual-doped graphene composite (Co9S8/NSG) has been proposed. The key point of this strategy is the function-oriented design of organic compounds. Herein, cobalt porphyrin derivatives with sulfo groups are employed as not only the coupling agents to form and anchor Co9S8 on the graphene in situ, but also the heteroatom-doped agent to generate S and N dual-doped graphene. The tight coupling of multiple active sites endows the composite materials with fast electrochemical kinetics and excellent stability for both oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The obtained electrocatalyst exhibits better activity parameter (E=0.82V) and smaller Tafel slope (47.7mVdec(-1) for ORR and 69.2mVdec(-1) for OER) than commercially available Pt/C and RuO2. Most importantly, as electrocatalyst for rechargeable Zn-air battery, Co9S8/NSG displays low charge-discharge voltage gap and outstanding long-term cycle stability over 138h compared to Pt/C-RuO2. To further broaden its application scope, a homemade all-solid-state Zn-air battery is also prepared, which displays good charge-discharge performance and cycle performance. The function-oriented design of N-4-metallomacrocycle derivatives might open new avenues to strategic construction of high-performance and long-life multifunctional electrocatalysts for wider electrochemical energy applications.									55	9	0	0	0	0	55			2311-6706	2150-5551		WOS:000455352300005	34137953

Here, we proposed using metal Bi with low work function to modify n-type Ta3N5, thus building an ohmic junction photocatalyst of Ta3N5/Bi. It achieved an about 5 times increase in CH4 yield compared with Ta3N5. The enhanced photocatalytic activity was ascribed to the following two effects: (1) The junction electric field drove the injection of conduction-band electrons of Ta3N5 to Bi, greatly improving separation efficiency of carriers; (2) The oxidation and reduction reaction sites were respectively constructed over Ta3N5 and Bi, effectively separating the oxidation reaction of H2O and the reduction reaction of CO2, which distinctly suppressed the reverse reaction during CH4 generation.									48	2	0	0	3	0	48			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000424960700002

Their functionally crucial charge (oxidation state) changes and electrocatalytic properties are best investigated under electrochemical operation conditions. We established operando Raman spectroscopy for investigation of the atomic structure and oxidation state of a non-crystalline, hydrated, and phosphate-containing Co oxide material (CoCat), which is an electrocatalyst for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) at neutral pH and is structurally similar to LiCoO2 of batteries. Raman spectra were collected at various sub-catalytic and catalytic electric potentials. H-2 labeling suggests Co oxidation coupled to Co-OH deprotonation at catalytic potentials. O-18 labeling supports O-O bond formation starting from terminally coordinated oxygen species. Two broad bands around 877 cm(-1) and 1077 cm(-1) are assigned to CoCat-internal H2PO4-. Raman peaks corresponding to terminal oxide (Co=O) or reactive oxygen species were not detectable; 1000-1200 cm(-1) bands were instead assigned to two-phonon Raman scattering. At an increasingly positive potential, the intensity of the Raman bands decreased, which is unexpected and explained by self-absorption relating to CoCat electrochromism. A red-shift of the Co-O Raman bands with increasing potentials was described by four Gaussian bands of potential-dependent amplitudes. By linear combination of Raman band amplitudes, we can follow individually the Co(2+/3+) and Co(3+/4+) redox transitions, whereas previously published x-ray absorption spectroscopy analysis could determine only the averaged Co oxidation state. Our results show how electrochemical operando Raman spectroscopy can be employed as a potent analytical tool in mechanistic investigations on OER catalysis.									27	0	0	0	3	0	27			0021-9606	1089-7690		WOS:000536733000002	33687254

Here, inspired by a fundamental understanding of the mechanism for both oxygen and hydrogen evolution half reactions (OER/HER), a unique strategy is presented to engineer RuO2 for superior alkaline water electrolysis through coupling with NiO as an efficient bifunctional promoter. Benefitting from desired potential-induced interfacial synergies, NiO-derived NiOOH improves the oxygen binding energy of RuO2 for enhanced OER, and NiO also promotes water dissociation for enhanced HER on RuO2-derived Ru. The resulting hybrid material exhibits remarkable bifunctional activities, affording 2.6 times higher OER activity than that of RuO2 and an HER activity comparable to Pt/C. As a result, the simple system requires only 1.5 V to deliver 10 mA cm(-2) for overall alkaline water splitting, outperforming the benchmark PtC/NF parallel to IrO2/NF couple with high mass loading. Comprehensive electrochemical investigation reveals the unique and critical role of NiO on the optimized RuO2/NiO interface for synergistically enhanced activities, which may be extended to broader (electro)catalytic systems.									155	7	0	0	9	0	156			1613-6810	1613-6829		WOS:000430398600015	29542284

In this article, we report the synthesis of ordered mesoporous CuO/CeO2 composite frameworks with different contents of copper(II) oxide and demonstrate their activity for photocatalytic O-2 production via UV-Vis light-driven oxidation of water. Mesoporous CuO/CeO2 materials have been successfully prepared by a nanocasting route, using mesoporous silica as a rigid template. X-ray diffraction, electron transmission microscopy and N-2 porosimetry characterization of the as-prepared products reveal a mesoporous structure composed of parallel arranged nanorods, with a large surface area and a narrow pore size distribution. The molecular structure and optical properties of the composite materials were investigated with Raman and UV-Vis/NIR diffuse reflectance spectroscopy. Catalytic results indicated that incorporation of CuO clusters in the CeO2 lattice improved the photochemical properties. As a result, the CuO/CeO2 composite catalyst containing similar to 38 wt % CuO reaches a high O-2 evolution rate of similar to 19.6 mu mol.h(-1) (or 392 mu mol.h(-1).g(-1)) with an apparent quantum efficiency of 17.6% at lambda = 365 +/- 10 nm. This OER activity compares favorably with that obtained from the non-porous CuO/CeO2 counterpart (similar to 1.3 mu mol.h(-1)) and pure mesoporous CeO2 (similar to 1 mu mol.h(-1)).									25	0	0	0	2	0	25			2079-4991			WOS:000367615500026	28347106

Experimental results show that the synergistic effect of Ru doping and NiO/Co3O4 heterostructure can significantly improve the catalytic activity. The existence of NiO/Co3O4 heterostructure, the appropriate proportion of Ru (only 2%) and the proper electronic energy state tuning are determined by electronic detection and elemental analysis, which enhanced the activation energy, electrical conductivity and electrochemical active surface area of the catalyst. Thus, the Ru-doped NiO/Co3O4 heterostructure exhibits superior OER/ORR/HER performance, reaching 100 mA cm(-2) in alkaline electrolytes at only 138 mV (HER) and 269 mV (OER) overpotential, and a high half-wave potential of 0.88 V (ORR). The water-splitting device assembled by the catalyst can operate stably for a long time (> 40 h), better than Pt/C and RuO2 at high current densities.									12	0	0	0	2	0	12			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000783209600003

Several computational investigations have found widely varying effects of doping on the theoretical overpotential of the OER on NiOx. Comparisons of these results are made difficult by the numerous differences in the structural and computational parameters used in these studies. In this work, within a consistent framework, we calculate the theoretical overpotentials for reactions occurring on the most stable, basal plane of undoped and doped beta-NiOOH. We compare the activities of Fe(III), Co(III), and Mn(III) doping using density functional theory with Hubbard-like U corrections on the transition-metal d orbitals. We compare the effect of surface and subsurface doping in order to establish whether the dopants act as new active sites for the reaction or whether they induce more widespread changes in the material. The results of our study find only a small reduction in the overpotential (similar to 0.1 and <= 0.05 V when doped in the surface and subsurface layers, respectively) for the three dopants, if doped in the dominant basal plane. This is much less than the reductions of 0.3 V experimentally observed for the most active Fe-doped systems. Furthermore, the magnitudes of reductions in overpotentials for the three dopants are similar. This work therefore disqualifies the possibility of enhancing the activity of the dominant exposed basal plane of beta-NiOOH through substitutional doping.									24	1	0	0	1	0	24			1463-9076	1463-9084		WOS:000448132600027	29999072

Herein, aiming at enhancing the performance of chlorine evolution reaction (ClER), which holds the key for chlor-alkali industry as well as water treatment, a nanostructured RuO2@TiO2 electrode is demonstrated to overcome the bubble shielding effect, thereby maximizing the working area and offering a robust working condition. Benefitting from the direct growing architecture and the superaerophobic surface property, this nanostructured RuO2@TiO2 electrode exhibits an excellent ClER performance, reaching 50 mA cm(-2) at a low potential of 1.10 V (vs SCE) with a Faradaic efficiency over approximate to 90%. Moreover, a prominent stability (250 mA cm(-2) for 10 h) is observed for this nanostructured electrode, probably due to the small vibrations and scratching forces from gas product.									68	6	0	0	5	0	70			1613-6810	1613-6829		WOS:000393193500017	27753209

Typically, mixed conducting perovskite ABO(3)-type materials are used for this purpose. The dominating surface terminations are (001) AO and BO2, with the relative fractions depending on materials composition and ambient conditions.Here, results of recent large-scale first principles (ab initio) calculations for the two alternative polar (La,Sr)O and MnO2 (001) terminations of (La,Sr)MnO3 cathode materials are discussed. The surface oxygen vacancy concentration for the (La,Sr)O termination is more than 5 orders of magnitude smaller compared to MnO2, which leads to drastically decreased estimated ORR rates. Thus, it is predicted for prototypical SOFC cathode materials that the BO2 termination largely determines the ORR kinetics, although with Sr surface segregation (long-term degradation) its fraction of the total surface area decreases, which slows down cathode kinetics.									9	0	0	0	1	0	9			2451-9103			WOS:000519095200019

Transition metal based LDHs (TM LDHs) are one of the most effective non-noble metal OER catalysts and have attracted wide interest, especially the nickel-iron LDH (NiFe LDH). The high valence Ni(3+)species with a large coordination number play a vital role in OER catalysis. Herein, we report on a surprising discovery that reaction between NiFe LDH and NaBH(4)with multi-hydrides induces vacancy formation around Fe(3+)and enrichment in Ni3+, crucially activating the OER performance. The ratio of Ni3+/Ni(2+)is found to be closely tied to the OER performance, nicely accounting for the leading role of Ni(3+)ions in octahedral sites in electrocatalysis. Significantly, the NaBH(4)treated NiFe LDH directly on nickel foam (NF), denoted as NaBH4-NiFe LDH@NF exhibited an outstanding OER performance with an overpotential of only 310 mV at 100 mA cm(-2), and a Tafel slope of 47 mV dec(-1). For the series of TM LDHs we studied with different metal combinations, the high valence metal ion is found to be positively related to OER performance.									24	0	0	0	1	0	23				2046-2069		WOS:000568227200049	35515047

One is a passive protection by which the body and materials are guarded by simple chemicals such as light absorbents, and the other is an active protection that repairs with metabolic reactions the internal injury suffered by many kinds of deterioration factors from the outside. Polyphenylene-ether was selected as a man-made material in which the metabolic reaction can be achieved in the atmosphere (21% of oxygen) and at room temperature (20-40 degrees C). The polymer introduces oxygen as an energy source, transports it with copper-complex and repairs the scission point of the chain. Such active protections were attempted for several polymers and some advantages and problems were elucidated. In this paper, the mechanisms of active protections in some plastics are reviewed and are also compared with protection systems of a living body, which provide us with very useful information on the development of advanced materials.

We prove that time records of the associated state taken only upstream and downstream all involved source positions do not uniquely identify the unknown elements defining the sought time-dependent point sources if their number is bigger or equal to 2. Then, based on some impulse response techniques we establish an identifiability theorem that under some reasonable assumptions on the time state recording positions yields uniqueness of those unknown elements. This theorem together with a data assimilation result led to develop a source detection-identification method that goes throughout the monitored domain to detect the presence of each unknown active source occurring between two state recording points. Once a source is detected, the established identification procedure localizes its position, determines the total amount loaded by this source and identifies the historic of its time-dependent source intensity function. Some numerical experiments on a variant of the surface water biological oxygen demand pollution model are presented.									12	0	0	0	2	0	12			1741-5977	1741-5985		WOS:000394653000004

Here, a strategy is developed for annealing-treated FeCo2O4 nanofibers at a magnetic field of 2500 Oe, named FeCo2O4-M, showing a right-shifted half-wave potential of 20 mV for the ORR and a left-shifted overpotential of 60 mV at 10 mV cm(-2) for the OER as compared with its counterpart. Magnetic characterizations indicate that FeCo2O4-M shows the spin-state transition of cations from a low-spin state to an intermediate-spin state compared with FeCo2O4. Mossbauer spectra show that the Fe3+ ion in the octahedral site (0.76) of FeCo2O4-M is more than that of FeCo2O4 (0.71), indicating the effective stimulus of metal cations in geometric sites by magnetic-field annealing. Furthermore, theoretical calculations demonstrate that the d-band centers (epsilon(d)) of Co 3d and Fe 3d in the tetrahedral and octahedral sites of the FeCo2O4-M nanofibers shift close to the Fermi level, revealing the enhanced mechanism of the ORR/OER activity.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			1613-6810	1613-6829		WOS:000727793200001	34877765

However, the synthesis of high-performance OER catalysts with minimal use of the rare and expensive element Ir is very challenging and requires the identification of electrically conductive and stable high-surface-area support materials. We developed a synthesis procedure for the production of large quantities of a nanocomposite powder containing titanium oxynitride (TiONx) and Ir. The catalysts were synthesized with an anodic oxidation process followed by detachment, milling, thermal treatment, and the deposition of Ir nanoparticles. The anodization time was varied to grow three different types of nanotubular structures exhibiting different lengths and wall thicknesses and thus a variety of properties. A comparison of milled samples with different degrees of nanotubular clustering and morphology retention, but with identical chemical compositions and Ir nanoparticle size distributions and dispersions, revealed that the nanotubular support morphology is the determining factor governing the catalyst's OER activity and stability. Our study is supported by various state-of-the-art materials' characterization techniques, like X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, scanning and transmission electron microscopies, X-ray powder diffraction and absorption spectroscopy, and electrochemical cyclic voltammetry. Anodic oxidation proved to be a very suitable way to produce high-surface-area powder-type catalysts as the produced material greatly outperformed the IrO2 benchmarks as well as the Ir-supported samples on morphologically different TiONx from previous studies. The highest activity was achieved for the sample prepared with 3 h of anodization, which had the most appropriate morphology for the effective removal of oxygen bubbles.									25	0	0	0	0	0	25			2155-5435			WOS:000611450000018	33489433

The kinetic barrier of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) on the 2D material catalysts in the presence of explicit solvents is scarcely studied. Here, we investigate the dynamics of the OER on the undoped graphene and the activation energy barrier of each step using first principles molecular dynamics simulations. Here we provide a detailed analysis of the kinetics of all the 4e(-) transfer steps of OER on the graphene surface. We also compare the accuracy of one of the density functional theory (DFT) functionals and density functional based tight binding (DFTB) method in explaining the OER steps. The comparative study reveals that DFTB can be used for performing metadynamics simulations quipped with much less computational cost than DFT functionals. By both Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof and DFTB methods, the third step is revealed to be the rate-determining step with an energy barrier of 21.19 +/- 0.51 and 20.23 +/- 0.20 kcal mol(-1), respectively. DFTB gives an impression of being successful in predicting the energy barriers of OER in 4e- transfer pathway and comparable to the DFT method, and we would like to extend the use of DFTB for further studies with a sizable and complex system.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			0192-8651	1096-987X		WOS:000639596900001	33851446

Polymers of intrinsic microporosity (PIMs) are known to possess extremely high internal surface area and ability to bind gases under dry conditions. It is shown here that both, hydrogen- and oxygen gas binding into PIMs, also occurs under wet or "triphasic" conditions in aqueous electrolyte environments (when immersed in 0.01 M phosphate buffer at pH 7). For two known PIM materials (PIM-1 and PIM-PY), nanoparticles are formed by an anti-solvent precipitation protocol and then cast as a film onto platinum or glassy carbon electrodes. Voltammetry experiments reveal evidence for hydrogen and oxygen binding. Both, PIM-1 and PIM-PY, locally store hydrogen or oxygen gas at the electrode surface and thereby significantly affect electrocatalytic reactivity. The onset of oxygen reduction on glassy carbon is shifted by 0.15 V in the positive direction.									17	0	0	0	4	0	17			2196-0216			WOS:000454705900031

Herein, we report a simple strategy to produce carboxyl-enriched multiwalled carbon nanotubes (COOH-MWNTs) that exhibit stable and high electrocatalytic activities for OER in acidic solutions, showing an overpotential at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) and a Tafel slope as low as of 265 mV and 82 mV dec(-1), respectively. As far as we are aware, these results represent the best OER performance for metal-free electrocatalysts, even comparable to those of RuO2 and IrO2. We have further revealed the catalytic mechanism, which involves one electron lose from the COOH-MWNTs catalyst at the beginning of the OER process to trigger H2O molecule oxidation by forming peralcohol, followed by the recapture of one electron from water molecule to oxidize water and to recover the initial state for the COOH-MWNTs catalyst. The unravel of this new OER mechanism is important as it provides new insights into the crucial role of organic functional groups in electrocatalytic processes. Also, the mechanistic understanding can be used to guide the design and development of novel metal-free catalysts for acidic OER electrocatalysis and beyond.									9	2	0	0	0	0	9				2567-3165		WOS:000732476300001

In response to this crisis, carbon capture, utilization, and storage/ sequestration technologies have been studied. So far, however, the economic feasibility of the existing conversion technologies is still inadequate owing to sluggish CO2 conversion. Herein, we report an aqueous zinc-and aluminum-CO2 system that utilizes acidity from spontaneous dissolution of CO2 in aqueous solution to generate electrical energy and hydrogen (H-2). The system has a positively shifted onset potential of hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) by 0.4V compared to a typical HER under alkaline conditions and facile HER kinetics with low Tafel slope of 34 mVdec @ 1. The Al-CO2 system has a maximum power density of 125 mWcm @ 2 which is the highest value among CO2 utilization electrochemical system.									20	0	0	0	2	0	20			1433-7851	1521-3773		WOS:000476611500001	31116484

However, the oxygen loss and structural distortion induce low initial coulombic efficiency and severe decay of cycle performance, further hindering their industrial applications. Herein, the representative layered Li-rich cathode material, Li1.2Ni0.2Mn0.6O2, is endowed with novel single-crystal morphology. In comparison to its polycrystal counterpart, not only can serious oxygen release be effectively restrained during the first oxygen activation process, but also the layered/spinel phase transition can be well suppressed upon cycling. Moreover, the single-crystal cathode exhibits the limited volume change and persistent presence of superlattice peaks upon Li+ (de)intercalation processes, resulting in enhanced structural stability with absence of crack generation and successive utilization of oxygen redox reaction during long-term cycling. Benefiting from these unique features, the single-crystal Li-rich electrode not only yields a high reversible capacity of 257 mAh g(-1), but also achieves excellent cycling performance with 92% capacity retention after 200 cycles. These findings demonstrate that the morphology design of single crystals can be regarded as an effective strategy to realize high-energy density and long-life Li-ion batteries.									14	0	0	0	0	0	14			1616-301X	1616-3028		WOS:000722927600001

An important yet unsolved problem in this ongoing effort is the identification of its catalytically active sites for proton reduction. In this work, cyclic voltammetry (CV), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and Raman spectroscopy were used to investigate the catalytically active sites and structural evolution of MoSx films during HER in 1 M HClO4 electrolyte. Transformation of anodically deposited MoSx (x approximate to 3) to a structure with MoSx composition during the cathodic sweep of a CV was demonstrated using XPS and operando Raman spectroscopy. Interestingly, a Raman peak at 2530 cm(-1) was recorded at potentials relevant to H-2 evolution, which we ascribed to the S-H stretching vibration of MoSx-H moieties. This assignment was corroborated by HID isotope exchange experiments. Mo-H (or Mo-D) stretching vibrations were not observed, which thus allowed us to rule out Mo centers as catalytic sites for proton reduction to H-2. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations were performed on a variety of MoSx structures to capture the heterogeneous nature of amorphous materials and corroborated the assignments of the observed vibrational frequencies. On the basis of these experimental measurements and quantum chemical simulations, we have for the first time directly pinpointed the sulfur atoms in amorphous MoSx to be the catalytically active sites for evolving H-2.									150	5	0	0	11	0	150			2155-5435			WOS:000387306100059

The reported enhancement in intrinsic OER activity of oxygen-deficient perovskites surfaces has inspired their fabrication via a myriad of schemes. Oxygen vacancies in perovskites are amongst the most favorable anionic or Schottky defects to be induced due to their low formation energies. This review discusses recent efforts for inducing oxygen vacancies in a multitude of perovskites, including facile and environmentally benign synthesis strategies, characterization techniques, and detailed insight into the intrinsic mechanistic modulation of perovskite electrocatalysts. Experimental, analytical, and computational techniques dedicated to the understanding of the improvement of OER activities upon oxygen vacancy induction are summarized in this work. The identification and utilization of intrinsic activity descriptors for the modulation of configurational structure, improvement in bulk charge transport, and favorable inflection of the electronic structure are also discussed. It is our foresight that the approaches, challenges, and prospects discussed herein will aid researchers in rationally designing highly active and stable perovskites that can outperform noble metal-based OER electrocatalysts.									23	0	0	0	0	0	23			2522-5731	2522-574X		WOS:000574500100001

Weakening of the crystallinity by engineering has been used to prepare four SnNb2O6/NiCo-LDH composites with different crystallinities. Among them, the amorphous-amorphous SnNb2O6/NiCo-LDH (SNO-LDH) Z-scheme heterojunction exhibits abundant oxygen vacancies (O-v). The as-prepared SNO-LDH (10 : 1) catalyst shows an optimal visible-light catalytic H-2 production rate of 82.2 mu mol h(-1) g(-1) that is four times greater than that of pure SnNb2O6, and reveals a high renewability (retained rate of 75.1%) after five cyclic experiments, which is attributed to the high efficiency of the photogenerated carrier separation, and the self-recovery of active metal and oxygen vacancies by regulating the crystallinity of the recycled catalysts. This study offers a novel viewpoint into the design of highly active and durable amorphous photocatalysts for use in energy and environmental applications.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2044-4753	2044-4761		WOS:000686599500001

The electrochemical method was used to measure the electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) properties of MCNFs. Electrochemical studies show that the developed MCNFs possess excellent electroactivity towards HER with low hydrogen-evolution overpotential and a small Tafel slope. In addition, electrospinning can promote the materials into nano-sized architectures with large surface area, which can effectively enhance the electrocatalytic HER properties of MCNFs.									19	1	0	0	0	0	19			2053-1591			WOS:000385423000004

The canonical source and sink terms of the marine oxygen budget include photosynthesis, respiration, photo-respiration, the Mehler reaction, and other smaller terms. However, recent advances in understanding cryptic oxygen cycling, namely the ubiquitous one-electron reduction of O-2 to superoxide by microorganisms outside the cell, remains unexplored as a potential player in global oxygen dynamics. Here we show that dark extracellular superoxide production by marine microbes represents a previously unconsidered global oxygen flux and sink comparable in magnitude to other key terms. We estimate that extracellular superoxide production represents a gross oxygen sink comprising about a third of marine gross oxygen production, and a net oxygen sink amounting to 15 to 50% of that. We further demonstrate that this total marine dark extracellular superoxide flux is consistent with concentrations of superoxide in marine environments. These findings underscore prolific marine sources of reactive oxygen species and a complex and dynamic oxygen cycle in which oxygen consumption and corresponding carbon oxidation are not necessarily confined to cell membranes or exclusively related to respiration. This revised model of the marine oxygen cycle will ultimately allow for greater reconciliation among estimates of primary production and respiration and a greater mechanistic understanding of redox cycling in the ocean.									23	2	0	0	13	0	24			0027-8424			WOS:000514096400021	32015131

Results show that inside the crevice the X70 steel could suffer from localized corrosion in NaHCO3 solution by polarization potential -0.4 V. The acidification initiated firstly at the crevice mouth and then extended gradually to the bottom. The hydrogen evolution could be observed with the development of corrosion and acidification. The cathodic reaction changed from the reduction of the dissolved oxygen to the reduction of hydrogen ions. The presence of Cl- did not change the crevice corrosion mechanism. With the increase of Cl- concentration, however, the crevice corrosion rate increased. The corrosion region moved towards the crevice bottom gradually and then pitting corrosion occurred with the increasing polarization potential. The initiation of crevice corrosion was determined by the polarization potential.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			1002-6495			INSPEC:17051178

The as-deposited thin film transformed from an FCC (face center cubic) structure at x = 0 into an amorphous structure at x = 1, which can be explained by determining topological instability and a hard ball model. After annealing was performed at 1000 degrees C for 30 min, the films presented a layered structure comprising metal solid solutions and oxygen-deficient oxides, which can be major attributed to oxygen traces in the vacuum furnace. Different Ti contents provided various phase separation and layered structures. The underlying mechanism is mainly related to the competition among possible oxides in terms of free energy production at 1000 degrees C.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			1996-1944			WOS:000414639000036	28953244

PCC 6803 exposed to intermittent light was studied by measuring oxygen evolution, respiration and the fluorescence parameters for maximum efficiency of excitation energy capture by photosystem II (PSII) reaction centres (F-v/F-m), PSII quantum yield (Delta F/F-m(1)) and non-photochemical quenching (NPQ). Cultures were pre-acclimated to constant light conditions. Block and sinusoidal light regimes were tested using four photon-flux densities (PFDs) applied in light/dark intervals of 1:1, 5:5 and 10:10 min. Light use was higher under the sinusoidal light regime compared with the block regime. The accumulated gross photosynthesis of the cyanobacterium was lower under intermittent light conditions compared with predictions from the photosynthesis-irradiance curve (PI curve). The respiration rates were similar for all light/dark intervals tested. However, the respiration slightly increased with increasing oxygen production for both block and sinusoidal light regime. NPQ, Delta F/F-m' and F-v/F-m depended on the PFD rather than on the duration of the light/dark intervals tested, and there was no detected influence of the two applied light regimes.									6	0	0	0	5	0	6			0031-9317	1399-3054		WOS:000232659800011

It is challenging to develop efficient non-noble metal-based electrocatalysts for HER. Herein, a Ni-Cr was doped on Copper foam (CF) substrate by adopting a simple annealing process. The high electrocatalytic efficiency for HER was achieved with Ni-Cr@CF electrode in strong basic medium with a lower overpotential of 144 mV to gain a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) with a small Tafel slope of 88 mV dec(-1). After surface modification, the CF substrate exhibits that the entire surface was uniformly covered with Ni-Cr species ensuring the fast reaction kinetics due to the efficient electron transfer process between the substrate and active catalyst. Moreover, the Ni-Cr@CF electrode exhibits excellent stability up to 2000 cycles under the strong basic medium. (C) 2020 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

All eukaryotic nuclear RNase Ps are ribonucleoproteins in which multiple protein components and a single RNA species are required for activity in vitro as well as in vivo. It is not known, however, which subunits participate directly in phosphodiester-bond hydrolysis. The RNA subunit of nuclear RNase P is evolutionarily related to its catalytically active bacterial counterpart, prompting speculation that in eukaryotes the RNA may be the catalytic component. In the bacterial RNase P reaction, Mg(II) is required to coordinate the nonbridging phosphodiester oxygen(s) of the scissile bond. As a consequence, bacterial RNase P cannot cleave pre-tRNA in which the pro-R-P nonbridging oxygen of the scissile bond is replaced by sulfur, In contrast, the RNase P reaction in plant chloroplasts is catalyzed by a protein enzyme whose mechanism does not involve Mg(II) coordinated by the pro-R-P oxygen. To determine whether the mechanism of nuclear RNase P resembles more closely an RNA- or a protein-catalyzed reaction, we analyzed the ability of Saccharomyces cerevisiae nuclear RNase P to cleave pre-tRNA containing a sulfur substitution of the pro-R-P oxygen at the cleavage site. Sulfur substitution at this position prohibits correct cleavage of pre-tRNA. Cleavage by eukaryotic RNase P thus depends on the presence of a thio-sensitive ligand to the pro-R-P oxygen of the scissile bond, and is consistent with a common, RNA-based mechanism for the bacterial and eukaryal enzymes.									35	0	0	0	34	0	37			1355-8382	1469-9001		WOS:000086642400010	10786846

The cluster was reconstituted by incubating the treated membranes with 1.0 mM Mn2+, 20 mM Ca2+, 10-mu-M 2,6-dichlorophenolindophenol, and Cl- under illumination with continuous or flashing light to restore the oxygen-evolving capacity. This light-dependent activation (photoactivation) of oxygen evolution did not occur to a significant extent at 3 mM Cl-, but markedly accelerated at higher Cl- concentrations without showing a saturation phenomenon even at 1 M Cl-. At 10 mM Cl- only about 10% of the oxygen-evolving activity before NH2OH treatment was restored by 5-min illumination with continuous light, whereas at 600 mM Cl- about 60% of the original activity was recovered. This acceleration resulted from at least two different actions of Cl-: (1) stabilization of the intermediate state involved in the photoactivation process and (2) increase in the quantum yield of photoactivation. The stabilization of the intermediate was saturated at about 150 mM Cl-, whereas the increase in yield did not show saturation. The Cl--induced increase in quantum yield did not involve any changes in the affinity of either Mn2+ binding or Ca2+ binding for photoactivation, but was rather ascribed to a protective effect of Cl- against inhibition of photoactivation by high concentrations of Mn2+. We also found that removal of the extrinsic 33-kDa protein from the PSII complex increased the Cl- requirement for photoactivation.									31	0	0	0	29	0	31			0006-2960			WOS:A1991FP30600008	2036406	
J	Frenck, HJ; Georgiou, S								Thermal effusion mass spectroscopic characterization of bulk YBa2Cu3O(7-delta) in comparison to CuO, BaO, BaCO3 and Y2O3								SURFACE SCIENCE				385	1			155	166		10.1016/S0039-6028(97)00256-2				AUG 1 1997	1997	Thermal effusion from bulk samples of superconductor YBa2Cu3O7-delta is examined by monitoring of all desorbing species via quadrupole mass spectrometry; For comparison purposes, thermal decomposition of the simple BaO, BaCO3, CuO and Y2O3 is also investigated. In these salts, effusion activation energies for oxygen and CO2 are shown to relate to the thermodynamics of the decomposition reactions leading to the evolution of these species in the gas phase. On the other hand, the activation energies of effusion for the metallic species reflect their binding in the distorted crystal left behind after oxygen or CO2 ejection. In the case of the superconducting YBa2Cu3O7-delta the activation energy of effusion is found to be negligibly (barium species) or little affected (copper) when comparing YBa2Cu3O7-delta with the simple salts. In contrast, the activation energy of effusion of YO shows a large effect, being almost a third-of that determined for Y2O3. The difference suggests that the final residue left by the thermal decomposition of YBa2Cu3O7-delta must be a highly disrupted Y2O3(s) structure, with significantly different thermodynamic properties.

Herein, sulfur doped iron oxide nanosheet arrays supported on nickel foam (FeOx-Ni3S2@NF) are prepared by a one-pot solvothermal reaction. Owing to the high intrinsic activity of FeOx-Ni3S2, the large catalytic specific surface area of nanosheet arrays and the fast charge transportation capability achieved by the self-supporting configuration, the FeOx-Ni3S2@NF electrode delivers excellent catalytic performance in alkaline simulated seawater (1 M KOH + 0.5 M NaCl). Impressively, a low overpotential of 120 mV at 50 mA cm(-2) with a Tafel slope of 57 mV dec(-1) for the hydrogen evolution reaction and an overpotential of 470 mV at 200 mA cm(-2) with a Tafel slope of 62 mV dec(-1) for the oxygen evolution reaction are achieved. More importantly, the voltage is only 1.5 V at 50 mA cm(-2) for continuous overall water splitting for 100 h at 200 mA cm(-2) with negligible decay in alkaline simulated seawater with almost 100% Faraday efficiency. This work provides a simple and universal strategy to prepare highly efficient bifunctional catalytic materials, promoting the development of Earth-abundant materials to catalyse seawater splitting to produce high-purity hydrogen.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			1477-9226	1477-9234		WOS:000691874300001	34608917

Herein, we elucidate the effects of oxygen and water surface adsorption on band alignment, interfacial charge transfer, and charge-carrier transport by using complementary Kelvin probe measurements and photoconductive atomic force microscopy on bismuth vanadate. By observing variations in surface potential, we show that adsorbed oxygen acts as an electron-trap state at the surface of bismuth vanadate, whereas adsorbed water results in formation of a dipole layer without inducing interfacial charge transfer. The apparent change of trap state density under dry or humid nitrogen, as well as under oxygen-rich atmosphere, proves that surface adsorbates influence charge-carrier transport properties in the material. The finding that oxygen introduces electronically active states on the surface of bismuth vanadate may have important implications for understanding functional characteristics of water splitting photoanodes, devising strategies to passivate interfacial trap states, and elucidating important couplings between reaction environments.									7	0	0	0	1	0	7			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000447954600033	30230810

Laser structuring technology is applied, and a large-scale development of active Ni-based cathodes is demonstrated. The most active electrode shows an overpotential of 104 mV at a current density of 300 mA cm-2 for the hydrogen evolution reaction at the end of the accelerated durability test protocol. Large 400 x 600 mm2 electrodes have been fabricated for the first time, and the electrodes thus fabricated are compared with state-of-theart electrodes in an industrial alkaline electrolyzer. Within the test period, the laser-structured Ni electrodes significantly outperformed the comparison electrodes. This impressively high activity is attributed to the existence of Ni oxide adjacent to the metallic Ni reaction sites.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0378-7753	1873-2755		WOS:000798957800004

The heat treatment of layered MnO2 nanosheets at elevated temperatures leads not only to transitions to low-valent manganese oxides but also to the creation of surface hole in the 2D nanosheet crystallites. Despite distinct phase transitions, highly anisotropic 2D morphology of the precursor MnO2 material remains intact upon the heat treatment whereas the diameter of surface hole becomes larger with increasing heating temperature. The obtained holey 2D Mn2O3 nanosheets show promising electrocatalyst performances for oxygen evolution reaction, which are much superior to that of nonporous Mn2O3 crystal. Among the present materials, the holey Mn2O3 nanosheet calcined at 500 degrees C displays the best electrocatalyst functionality with markedly decreased overpotential, indicating the importance of heating condition in optimizing the electrocatalytic activity. Of prime importance is that this material shows much better catalytic activity for Li-O-2 batteries than does nonporous Mn2O3, underscoring the critical role of porous 2D morphology in this functionality. This study clearly demonstrates the unique advantage of holey 2D nanosheet morphology in exploring economically feasible transition metal oxide-based electrocatalysts and electrodes for Li-O-2 batteries.									49	1	0	0	0	0	49			1616-301X	1616-3028		WOS:000430658300018

To develop efficient oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalysts for seawater electrolysis, the ultrathin MnO(x )film-covered NiFelayered double-hydroxide nanosheet array is directly assembled on Ni foam (MnOx/NiFe-LDH/NF) by hydrothermal and electrodeposition in turn. This catalyst demonstrates excellent OER-selective activity in alkaline saline electrolytes. In 1 M KOH/ 0.5 M NaCl and 1 M KOH/seawater electrolytes, MnOx/NiFe-LDH/NF exhibits lower overpotentials at 100 mA cm(-2) (eta(100) values of 265 and 276 mV, respectively) and Tafel slopes (73 and 77 mV decade(-1), respectively) than does the NiFe-LDH/NF electrode (eta(100) values of 298 and 327 mV and Tafel slopes of 91 and 140 mV decade(-1), respectively). In alkaline saline solutions, the stability and durability of the former are also better than those of the latter. The good OER selectivity and catalytic performance are attributed to the MnOx overlayer that selectively blocks Cl- anions from approaching catalytic centers, and the good conductivity, fast kinetics, more oxygen vacancies, and abundant active sites of MnOx/NiFe-LDH/NF. The robust stability is due to the enhanced resistance for Cl- corrosion stemming from the MnOx protective film. Hence, MnOx/NiFe-LDH/NF can act as a promising OER electrocatalyst for alkalized natural seawater electrolysis.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0020-1669	1520-510X		WOS:000859267300001	36083871

Using first principles calculations, we study the structural characteristics of partially oxidized nickel-based nanoheterostructures (NiO/Ni NHSs), and the interfacial effects on hydrogen evolution. The origin of the enhanced hydrogen evolution performance is discussed at the microscopic level. This study identifies two types of active sites of the exposed Ni surface available for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). One is the hcp-hollow sites near the perimeter boundary that exhibit a more excellent HER performance than platinum (Pt), and the other the second nearest neighbor fcc-hollow sites away from the boundary that exhibit a similar performance to Pt. The interfacial effects result from the competitive charge transfer between NiO and Ni surfaces in NHSs, and enhance the reactivity of NiO/Ni NHSs by shifting the d-states of surface atoms down in energy. The illumination of the mechanism would be helpful for the design of more efficient and cheap transition metal-based catalysts.									11	0	0	0	0	0	11			1463-9076	1463-9084		WOS:000428778100007	29511747

The infiltrated BDC particles are 10-20 nm in size and cover on LSM and YSZ particles. The 10 wt% and 20 wt% BDC-LSM-YSZ samples show a large peak for the desorption of surface oxygen species and a large peak for the evolution of lattice oxygen, reflecting their good redox property. 0.1BDC-LSM-YSZ cell and 0.2BDC-LSM-YSZ cell give the power density at 0.6 V of 387.8 and 521.7 mWcm(-2) at 600 degrees C, which is 3.7 and 4.9 times higher than that of LSM-YSZ cell, respectively. 0.1BDC-LSM-YSZ cell and 0.2BDC-LSM-YSZ cell exhibit low ohmic resistance and low total polarization resistance. The DRT analysis reveals that charge transfer reaction and surface diffusion are greatly accelerated on the BDC-LSM-YSZ cathodes. (C) 2017 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Currently, the best catalyst for the hydrogen evolution reaction is based on metallic platinum whose high price severely restricts large-scale application. Here we report a silver catalyst with superior activity and durability in an acid medium that outperforms commercial platinum on carbon, especially under high applied voltages. We adopt a physical technique-laser ablation in liquid-to generate a high density of stacking faults in silver nanoparticles. We find that the stacking faults can cause a low coordination number and high tensile strain, which jointly improve the adsorption energy and transform the non-active silver into a highly active catalyst. In light of the high activity, conductivity, durability and low price, the silver catalyst can serve as a promising alternative to commercial platinum on carbon for industrial application.									148	11	0	0	13	0	151			2520-1158			WOS:000502586500012

However, the evolution of the point defect profiles in ionic conductors such as yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) can complicate the picture of homogeneous Joule heating and thermal runaway during DC flash sintering. Here, 8 mol% YSZ pellets were partially flash sintered under a DC bias using various current densities and hold times. The electrode geometry was varied to modulate the oxygen ion flux available to the cathode to compare the effects on the resulting oxygen vacancy inhomogeneity. The contribution from fundamental and experimental factors to the cathodic reduction reaction is also discussed, such as interface reaction kinetics and sample geometry. Local reduction of the ceramic was inevitably observed under all current densities and the resulting microstructural inhomogeneity was explained as the result of a transient conductivity asymmetry. This asymmetry was the result of the enhanced electronic conductivity in the cathode region to a value significantly greater than the ionic conductivity of near-stoichiometric YSZ. The link between the local conductivity, voltage and Joule heating is mathematically demonstrated to result in an asymmetric heating profile. (C) 2019 Acta Materialia Inc. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

However, the traditional materials design concept limits the exploration of high-performance catalysts. The born of a materials design concept based on multiple elements, high-entropy materials, provides a promising path to break the shackles of compositional design in materials science. A number of high-entropy materials were reported to show remarkable properties for electrocatalytic water splitting applications. High-entropy materials were widely confirmed to be one kind of the best electrocatalysts for water splitting applications. Due to the synergy of multiple metal components, they show excellent catalytic activity. Several nontraditional methods were developed and reported to prepare high-performance high-entropy materials.

Replacing the OER with the glycerol oxidation reaction (GOR) at the anode is recognized as a potential strategy to address this issue. In this work, the self-supported electrocatalytic electrode of Cu-Cu2O nanoclusters on carbon cloth (Cu-Cu2O/CC) is fabricated for the electrocatalysis of the GOR, which has high activity towards the GOR, reaching 10 mA cm(-2) at an applied voltage of 1.21 V, and shows high selectivity for formate production with a faradaic efficiency (FE) of over 80% in a wide potential range. Moreover, a hybrid acid/alkali electrolyzer is assembled by coupling the Cu-Cu2O/CC anode for the GOR in an alkaline electrolyte with commercial Pt/C as the cathode for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in an acid electrolyte. The dual-electrolyte electrolytic cell only requires an applied voltage of 0.59 V to reach 10 mA cm(-2) with a FE of similar to 100% for H-2 and 97% for formate production. This work provides a facile strategy for the application of glycerol upgradation in energy-saving water electrolysis systems.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000847465800001	36039893

Our results reveal the formation of additional TiO precipitates in both alloys at temperatures of 450-600 degrees C in both alloys. The implanted positrons become trapped at the nm-thick TiO/matrix interface, and act as effective probes of the concomitant annealing of vacancies taking place inside the TiO precipitates above 550 degrees C in V-4Ti alloy. The presence of Cr in the ternary alloy not only retards the recovery of dislocations, but also enhances the oxygen diffusivity and therefore decreases the vacancy content in the TiO precipitates. These results will impact the expected alloy stability and capacity to bind light elements in the operational temperature window of these alloys for fusion reaction applications.

The dense structure of the film promoted charge transmission, and the combination of the p-type CBS and n-type semiconductor In2S3 deposited by the chemical bath method improved the electron-hole separation efficiency, resulting in a significantly enhanced photocurrent. Deposition of Au nanoparticles reduced the required free energy for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), improving the selectivity from O-2 to H2O2. The photoelectrochemical (PEC) synthesis proceeds by an indirect 2e(-) ORR initial formation of superoxide, which is disproportionated to H2O2.

There are three crucial steps for the photocatalytic water splitting reaction: solar light harvesting, charge separation and transportation, and the catalytic H-2 and O-2 evolution reactions. While significant achievement has been made in optimizing the first two steps in the photocatalytic process, much less efforts have been put into improving the efficiency of the third step, which demands the utilization of cocatalysts. To date, cocatalysts based on rare and expensive noble metals are still required for achieving reasonable activity in most semiconductor-based photocatalytic systems, which seriously restricts their large-scale application. Therefore, seeking cheap, earth-abundant and high-performance cocatalysts is indispensable to achieve cost-effective and highly efficient photocatalytic water splitting. This review for the first time summarizes all the developed earth-abundant cocatalysts for photocatalytic H-2- and O-2-production half reactions as well as overall water splitting. The roles and functional mechanism of the cocatalysts are discussed in detail. Finally, this review is concluded with a summary, and remarks on some challenges and perspectives in this emerging area of research.									1735	110	0	0	114	0	1746			0306-0012	1460-4744		WOS:000343993100016	24429542	
J	Giancaterina, S; Rossi, A; Rivaton, A; Gardette, JL								Photochemical evolution of poly(ether ether ketone)								POLYMER DEGRADATION AND STABILITY				68	1			133	144		10.1016/S0141-3910(99)00181-0				2000	2000	The photochemical evolution of poly(ether ether ketone) (PEEK) has been investigated under polychromatic irradiation (lambda > 300 nm) in the absence and in the presence of oxygen. The modifications of the structure of the films resulting from irradiation was monitored by Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) and W-visible spectroscopy. The various photoproducts formed were identified by HPLC analysis of the low molecular weight fragments after methanolic extraction. Confirmation of the photoproducts nature was obtained by derivatisation reactions, chemical titration and physical treatments. Under Vacuum exposure, as a result of direct absorption of the incident radiation by the basic backbone structure of PEEK, the photolytical processes that occur involve pinacolisation reaction, photo-Claisen type rearrangement and direct chain scissions; subsequent H-abstraction leads to the formation of numerous molecular compounds. Photoproducts resulting from inter- and intra-molecular phenylation reactions and the formation of light absorbing transients account for the photodiscoloration of the irradiated films. Under exposure in aerated media, the oxidation of the photoproducts issue from direct phototransformations accounts for the photodegradation of PEEK; the oxidative attack of the phenyl moieties via ring opening reactions is also involved.

The results of XRD and XPS confirmed the incorporation of phosphorus into the lattice of Co9S8. Electrochemical tests demonstrated that Co9S8/P@CS performs a high electrocatalytic activity for oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Under the current density of 10 mA cm(-2), Co9S8/P@CS-1:2 as the best catalyst has the lowest overpotential of 233 mV and Tafel slope of 48 mV dec(-1), which is far superior to the current noble-metal catalyst IrO2 (414 mV, 96 mV dec(-1)). A rechargeable Zn-air battery was assembled with Co9S8/P@CS-1:2 as the air-electrode catalyst. Its maximum power density reached 142.50 mW cm(-2) at 0.56 V and the current density was 255.47 mA cm(-2), significantly higher than those of the battery made by Pt/C-IrO2 catalysts. Especially, after 350 h (1050 cycles) of charge and discharge, the performance of this assembled battery did not show a significant decrease, predicting a broad application prospect. In-situ Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and density functional theory (DFT) calculations were used to analyze the active sites of catalyst and catalytic mechanism, revealing the relationships between structure and the catalytic performance for OER.									38	1	0	0	2	0	38			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000499066900129

The codoping of phosphorus and aluminum into nickel oxide nanosheets leads to an optimum balance among surface chemical state, electrochemically active surface area, and density of active sites. As a result, it can afford a current density of 100 mA cm(-2) at the overpotential of 310 mV for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at the overpotential of 138 mV for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in 1 M KOH. When it was used as a bifunctional catalyst in a two-electrode water-splitting device, a potential 2 of 1.56 V was achieved at the current density of 10 mA cm(-2).									107	7	0	0	1	0	107			2380-8195			WOS:000430369600021

Herein, we synthesize a three-dimensional (3D) heterogeneous structure of NixCoySe2 nanospheres loaded onto NiFe hydroxide (NiFe-LDH) nanosheets via bare nickel foam (NF) two-step electrodeposition. The optimal NiFe-LDH@NixCoySe2/NF nanosheets heterojunction electrocatalyst is verified with an excellent OER performance in 1.0 M KOH solution, which only requires a low overpotential of 265.5 mV and 297.8 mV to drive high current density of 100 mA cm-2 and 500 mA cm-2, respectively, long-term durability of more than 60 h at 100 mA cm-2, and an extremely low Tafel slope of 57.5 mV dec- 1. Meanwhile, due to the dramatic improvement in OER performance, there is an enhancement in the overall water-splitting activity of the NiFe-LDH@NixCoySe2/NF nanosheets heterojunction, attaining a current density of 20 mA cm-2 at the low cell voltage of 1.65 V. As a result, it shows the importance of constructing highly efficient OER catalyst with the rational design of heterostructures. The enhanced catalytic performance can be attributed to the large exposed electrocatalytic active sites accessible and constructed an efficient elec-tronic transmission channel by eliminating contact resistance.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000868980000001

Though exhibiting benign OER performance, the catalytic activity of perovskite oxides is restricted by their inferior specific area and insufficient hydroxyl affinity. Here, a novel architecture composed of a karren structure and hybrid phase was proposed to uplift the kinetic limitation of hydroxyl adsorption and charge transfer. As a proof-of-concept, the karren-structure perovskite-based compound (Pr0.5Ba0.25Sr0.25Co0.8Fe0.2O3-delta-Co3O4) synthesized by facile molten-salt synthesis exhibits excellent OER activity with a low overpotential of 360 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) in 0.1 M KOH, and delivers 5-fold mass activity at 1.63 V relative to pristine perovskite Pr0.5Ba0.25Sr0.25Co0.8Fe0.2O3-delta, outperforming various transition metal oxides and noble metal RuO2. With insights from physicochemical characterization and in situ electrochemical analysis, the interlinked karren structure is effective in providing active area and ion transfer channels for promoting the contact of hydroxyl with active sites, while the strong electronic interaction of the hybrid phase further favors the hydroxyl adsorption and charge transfer, synergistically expediting the sluggish OER kinetics. This work provides insights into the design of perovskite-based electrocatalysts with high performance via a synergistic structural modulation.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000841872900001

Hetero-structure composite electrode based on copper sulfide (CuS), zinc oxide (ZnO), and porous carbonized cotton (PCc) is prepared via vacuum thermal evaporation technology and successive ionic layer adsorption methods. Porous substrate provides plenty of active sites, which facilitates the exchange of ions/charges in the electrode processes. The composite electrode exhibits outstanding electrochemical energy storage and electrocatalytic performances. The symmetrical super-capacitor as assembled reaches a high energy density of 0.27 Wh cm(-2) at the power density of 3.34 W cm(-2). By optimizing the composite structure, the energy barriers of the CuS/ZnO/PCc compound are reduced obviously in oxygen evolution reaction in comparison with pure PCc or CuS/PCc. The overpotential of the sample is decreased to 337 mV (10 mA cm(-2) of the loop current) compared to that of PCc (492 mV) and CuS/PCc (415 mV). This work may inspire the rational design of composite electrode materials to achieve high performance in cross-field applications. (C) 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

However, it is challenging to effectively utilize metal ions in the NFF to prepare new advanced electrocatalysts without introduction of metal species. Here, we demonstrate that activated metal ions in NiFe foam serve as the support and metal sources for in situ synthesis of NiFe bimetal-organic frameworks (NFF-MOF). Specifically, by further acidification to activate NiFe metal ions on the NFF backbone, and then to generate active NFF-MOF species through the participation of the organic ligand, the resulting NFF-MOF material exhibits significantly improved electrocatalytic performance toward the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) with ultralow overpotentials of 81 and 250 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2), respectively. Density functional theory calculations and experimental results suggest that the NFF-MOF from the in situ-activated NiFe foam promotes transport and separation of charge because of highly uniform dispersed metal sites, high porosity, and an ordered 3D skeleton structure, thus accelerating the electrochemical HER and OER. This work brings new insights for the development of next-generation high-efficiency electrocatalysts.									17	0	0	0	1	0	17			2168-0485			WOS:000617925200038

The resulted Ni5P4 exhibited high crystallization, affluent P content and considerable surface area. Further, Ni5P4 grow onto nickel foam (Ni5P4/NF) and the electrocatalytic performances were investigated. Ni5P4/NF showed excellent catalytic activity with low overpotential of 64 mV for HER and 182 mV for OER at current density 10 mA/cm(2). Its exceptional activity is shown in its small Tafel slope of 64 mV dec(-1) and 58 mV dec(-1) for HER and OER, respectively. And it can be maintained high catalytic activity after the 40,000 s test. These outstanding performances are mainly attributed to the high p content and unique structure of rice-shape that that boosts the intrinsic catalytic activity and active surface area.									16	2	0	0	0	0	16			1387-7003	1879-0259		WOS:000449240900019

Measurements of laser-induced fluorescence (LIF) as well as light scattering by particles were conducted in the reaction zone in order to observe the evolution of transient molecules in realtime. Si(P-3), SiCl, and SiCl2 were observed as direct photoproducts, and SiO was observed as a product of the initial oxidation process. Si and SiCl were confirmed to react with O-2 rapidly, whereas SiCl2 was totally inert at room temperatures and reduced pressures (15-60 Torr in Ar). SiO was found to have second-order decay rates to the concentration of SiO itself. This may be attributed to the recombination of SiO forming a dimer. By comparing the evolution of SiO with the particle growth rate deduced from the scattering signals, the reaction mechanism for particle formation is discussed.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			0022-3654			WOS:A1994PL69100023

It is found that all the iron ions can be incorporated into the ceria lattice to form a solid solution for the FeCe 5 (Fe 5%) sample, but amorphous or crystal Fe2O3 particles were found to be present on the Fe-Ce oxide samples with higher the iron content. The reducibility of single solid solution was much better than the pure CeO2, and the appearance of dispersed Fe-2 O-3 particles improved the surface reducibility of materials. The iron ions incorporated into the CeO2 lattice accelerated the oxygen release from bulk to surface, and surface Fe-2 O-3 particles in close contact to CeO2 acted as a catalyst for the reaction between solid solution and hydrogen. The microstructure of exposed Fe2O3 with Ce-Fe-O solid solution allows the Fe-Ce mixed oxides to own good reducibility and high OSC, which also counteracts the deactivation of the reducibility resulting from the sintering of materials in the redox cycling.

In a separate realm, nanostructured noble metals are found to exhibit photocatalytic activity under plasmonic excitation with no electrical bias. Here, we explore the convergence of the electrocatalytic and photocatalytic activity of nanostructured noble metals in electrochemical reactions performed under plasmonic excitation. We use as a model the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) on Au nanoparticle (NP) electrocatalysts. We observe that plasmonic excitation of the Au NP electrocatalyst enhances the HER activity. We trace the mechanistic origin of this plasmonic enhancement by using a combination of electrochemical techniques. Specifically, we resolve the contribution of hot carriers from that of heat generated by plasmonic excitation in the observed enhancement. Although photothermal heating plays a minimal role, hot electrons generated by plasmon excitation result in cathodic photocharging of the Au NP electrode, which enhances interfacial electrontransfer kinetics and manifests in a reduced overpotential. The higher the light intensity, the greater is the decrease in the overpotential, that is, the activation barrier. The photopotential resulting from plasmonic excitation exclusively enhances the Faradaic reaction without an increase in the double-layer charging. In summary, this article provides a unified model of the influence of plasmonic excitation on an electrochemical reaction.									33	0	0	0	3	0	32			1932-7447	1932-7455		WOS:000501623100033

To address shortcomings of the existing catalysts, here we develop a new bi-functional catalysts cobalt-based nano-architecture with ordered, Ni-doped two-dimensional (2D) defect-rich nanosheets. Innovative combination of doping, annealing, and sulfidation is developed to fabricate the hierarchical porous metal sulfide (denoted as Ni-Co-S) nanosheets arrays (HPNA) directly on conductive carbon cloth (CC). Owing to the unique architecture with the specific surface area and porous structure, short ion diffusion paths, the Ni-Co-S HPNA exhibits excellent electrocatalytic activitiy for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in alkaline solution, featuring low overpotentials of 110 and 270 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2), respectively. The excellent catalytic performance is attributed to the unique porous structure, abundant active sites and efficient mass transport. More importantly, when the Ni-Co-S HPNA serves as both the anode and cathode, it achieves a 1.62 Vat 10 mA cm(-2) and remains stable over 12 h of the overall water splitting process.

Herein, we first report the selenium (Se) vacancies-decorated ultrafine platinum-nickel (PtNi-Se-v) nanowires, as a bifunctional catalyst for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and methanol oxidation reaction (MOR). The optimized PtNi-Se-v exhibits obvious enhancement for HER and MOR compared to PtNi nanowires. It displays merely an overpotential of 18.8 mV for alkaline HER and the outstanding MOR performance (3.51 A/mg(Pt)). When applying in one symmetric overall water splitting electrolyzer coupling with HER and MOR, an ultralow working voltage of 0.637 V with 100% Faraday efficiency for hydrogen production was achieved at the current density of 10 mA/cm(2). Further investigations reveal that the weakened hydrogen binding energy, strong OH binding as well as relative weak CO binding are responsible for the improved HER and MOR activities.									5	0	0	0	1	0	5			2766-8525	2688-819X		WOS:000844493100010		
J	Hamdi, Adel								Inverse source problem in a 2D linear evolution transport equation: detection of pollution source								INVERSE PROBLEMS IN SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING				20	3			401	421		10.1080/17415977.2011.637207				2012	2012	This article deals with the identification of a time-dependent source spatially supported at an interior point of a 2D bounded domain. This source occurs in the right-hand side of an evolution linear advection-dispersion-reaction equation. We address the problem of localizing the source position and recovering the history of its time-dependent intensity function. We prove the identifiability of the sought source from recording the state on the outflow boundary of the controlled domain. Then, assuming the source intensity function vanishes before reaching the final control time, we establish a quasi-explicit identification method based on some exact boundary controllability results that enable to determine the elements defining the sought source using the records of the state on the outflow boundary and of its flux on the inflow boundary. Some numerical experiments on a variant of the surface water biological oxygen demand pollution model are presented.									9	2	0	0	1	0	11			1741-5977	1741-5985		WOS:000303213600007

However, a large overpotential is generally required to achieve the current density for industrial water electrolysis. As a result, it is highly desirable to develop high-performance and cost-effective hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) electrocatalysts for the widespread application of water splitting. Perovskite oxides have emerged as a new category of nonprecious metal catalysts for electrocatalytic HER due to their low cost , abundant compositions and flexible structures. In this review, the HER mechanism in alkaline environment is briefly elaborated. Then, the research progress of perovskite oxides in HER is reviewed. Moreover, the strategies (ion doping, heterostructure engineering, morphology and structure regulation, etc.) for promoting HER performance are discussed and analyzed. Finally, the remaining challenges faced by perovskite HER electrocatalysts and the future prospects are put forward.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0253-3820	1872-2040		WOS:000662230600014

For the formation of a two-dimensional electron liquid (2DEL) at the interface of LaAlO3/SrTiO3 (LAO/STO) systems, although it is well accepted that the conduction of amorphous-LAO/STO samples comes exclusively from the oxygen vacancies due to interfacial redox reactions, the relative contribution of ionic reconstruction and electronic reconstruction to the conduction at the polar crystalline LAO/STO interface has been a topic of debate. Herein, by resonant x-ray photoemission spectroscopy and x-ray absorption spectroscopy measurements, we investigated the evolution of the Ti 2p signal as well as the in-gap states at the diluted oxide interface of LaAl1-xMnxO3/STO (0 <= x <= 0.3), where the doping of Mn into LAO gradually decreases the carrier density of the interfacial 2DEL but does not change the interface polarity. The spectroscopic results present direct evidence that the conduction from redox reaction at polar LAO/STO interfaces is suppressed by increasing the Mn doping level without the need of oxygen postannealing. A pure polarity discontinuity induced electronic reconstruction can be achieved by deliberately controlling the Mn doping level in LAO, which results in low-carrier, high-mobility, and spin-polarized 2DELs at x = 0.3.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2475-9953			WOS:000779826900001

One unique caveat of this reaction is the inclusion of hydrogen gas (H-2) evolution as a requirement of the reaction mechanism. In the absence of nitrogen gas as a substrate, nitrogenase will reduce available protons to become a directional ATP-dependent hydrogenase. Aerobic nitrogen-fixing microbes are of particular interest, because these organisms have evolved to perform these reactions with oxygen-sensitive enzymes in an environment surrounded by oxygen. The ability to maintain a functioning nitrogenase in aerobic conditions facilitates the application of these organisms under conditions where most anaerobic nitrogen fixers are excluded. In recent years, questions related to the potential yields of the nitrogenase-derived products ammonium and H-2 have grown more approachable to experimentation based on efforts to construct increasingly more complicated strains of aerobic nitrogen fixers such as the obligate aerobe Azotobacter vinelandii. This mini-review provides perspectives of recent and historical efforts to understand and quantify the yields of ammonium and H-2 that can be obtained through the model aerobe A. vinelandii, and outstanding questions that remain to be answered to fully realize the potential of nitrogenase in these applications with model aerobic bacteria.									12	2	0	0	9	0	14			0175-7598	1432-0614		WOS:000504482400002	31879824

When designing a novel catalyst, it is necessary to optimize the exposure and accessibility of its active sites as well as the reaction kinetics. This can be realized by combining an appropriate chemical composition of the material, including doping with metal elements, and a properly nanostructured morphology offering a high surface contact. We report here on the design and performances of cobalt-based oxide and sulfide nanowires as catalysts that can be used for both hydrogen and oxygen evolution reactions (denoted HER and OER respectively) in the same compatible electrolyte. Following a sulfuration process, Co3O4 nanowires are entirely converted into Co3S4 nanowires showing greatly improved OER catalytic performances with an overpotential of 283 mV (instead of 371 mV for Co3O4) to deliver a current density of 10 mA cm(-2). Besides, when doping the surface of these Co3S4 nanowires with small amounts of nickel, the resulting Ni:Co3S4 nanowires exhibit an HER overpotential of 199 mV to reach 10 mA cm(-2). But most importantly, two-electrode electrolyzer cells combining Co3S4 and Ni:Co3S4 electrodes show operating voltages as low as 1.70 V at 10 mA cm(-2) over 40 hours, a value that competes advantageously with the best reported catalysts in 1.0 M KOH. Meanwhile, density functional theory (DFT) calculations show that the free energy of the intermediates has been reduced after the introduction of sulfur and nickel atoms, which have smaller overpotentials and corresponding enhanced electrocatalytic performance. Our results open a new avenue in the quest for overall water splitting using electrochemical systems.									57	1	0	0	0	0	57			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000459578800010	30601563	
J	Sial, Muhammad Aurang Zeb Gul; Lin, Haifeng; Wang, Xun								Microporous 2D NiCoFe phosphate nanosheets supported on Ni foam for efficient overall water splitting in alkaline media								NANOSCALE				10	27			12975	12980		10.1039/c8nr03350a				JUL 21 2018	2018	The development of high-performance non-precious electrocatalysts for both H-2 and O-2 evolution reactions (HER and OER activities) and overall water splitting is highly desirable but remains a grand challenge. Herein, we report a facile method to synthesize ultrathin, amorphous, porous, oxygen and defect enriched NiCoFe phosphate nanosheets (NSs). Owing to their microporous confinement in a 2D orientation, which can reduce the ion transport resistance during electrochemical processes, and defect enriched structure with higher electrochemically active surface area, these NiCoFe phosphate porous nanosheets supported on nickel foam (NiCoFe phosphate NSs/NF) facilitate the diffusion of gaseous products (H-2 and O-2) and exhibit remarkable catalytic performance and outstanding stability for both HER, OER and overall water splitting in an alkaline electrolyte (1.0 M KOH). For the OER electrocatalyst, 2D NiCoFe phosphate NSs/NF was oxidized to NiCoFe oxides/hydroxides on the catalyst surface and exhibited remarkable OER activity with a low overpotential of only 240 mV needed to reach a current density of 10 mA cm(-2). For HER, 2D NiCoFe phosphate NSs/NF afforded a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at a low overpotential of only -231 mV. Furthermore, employing 2D NiCoFe phosphate NSs/NF as the electrocatalyst for both the anode and the cathode, a water splitting electrolyzer was able to reach 10 mA cm(-2) at a cell voltage of 1.52 V with robust durability. Various characterization techniques indicated that the long term stability and the activity for overall water splitting are due to the porosity, the electrochemically active constituents, and synergistic effects. This work could be inspiring in the design of Earth abundant and highly efficient electrocatalysts for overall water splitting, especially for OER.									68	5	0	0	3	0	68			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000438665100006	29964289

Electrolyzed water is a hydrogen evolution process with high efficiency, no by-products, and high hydrogen purity. Here, we propose to use ZIF-67 as the precursor to prepare three-dimensional multilayer rGO supported CoS2 quantum dots (CoS2QDs@rGO) through a two-step hydrothermal method and one-step calcinations method. The as-prepared electrocatalyst with maximum exposure of edge active sites is highly efficient for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), delivering an extremely small Tafel slope of 78 mV dec-1, and prominent durability. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that decoration of CoS2QDs not only obviously changes Gibbs free energy of hydrogen adsorption (Delta GH*), but also offers more active sites for HER, conspicuous promoting the catalytic activity of as-obtained electrode materials. It can be expected that our CoS2 quantum dots mounted on three-dimensional multilayer rGO with ZIF-67 as the precursor, will provide a novel, high-yield and effective catalytic material for energy conversion applications.									11	0	0	0	1	0	11			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000722615700004

At an optimal ratio of 14.6 wt % MoS2, the resultant material exhibits prominent catalytic activity for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) with a high hydrogen production rate of 10 046 mu mol h(-1) g(-1) under visible light illumination with fluorescein as photosensitizer. Furthermore, the synthesized catalyst also possesses an attractive electrocatalytic activity with an onset overpotential of -300 mV (vs RHE) and a Tafel slope of similar to 81 mV dec(-1). The enhanced catalyst performances are mainly attributed to the in situ formed active sites, featuring a uniform dispersion and strong connection of MoS2 and TiO2, which can facilitate electron transfer. In addition, the MoS2@TiO2 nanohybrids are highly stable and completely recyclable over HER.									131	8	0	0	8	0	134			1944-8244			WOS:000385469000040	27654633

Adding molecular gases to the noble working gas which flows through the jet is a common method to tailor the resulting production of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species (RONS). In this paper, results are discussed from a computational investigation of the consequences of H2O and O-2 admixtures on the reactive chemistry of He APPJs flowing into humid air. This investigation, performed with a 2-dimensional plasma hydrodynamics model, addresses the RONS that are initially produced and the evolution of that chemistry on longer time scales. Without an admixture, the impurities in 99.999% pure helium are a major source of RONS. The addition of H2O decreases the production of reactive nitrogen species (RNS) and increases the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). The addition of O-2 significantly decreases the production of RNS, as well as hydrogen-containing ROS, but increases the production of ROS without hydrogen. This selectivity comes from the lower ionization energy of O-2 compared to N-2 and H2O, which then allows for charge exchange reactions. These charge exchange reactions change the RONS which are produced in the afterglow by dissociative recombination. The consequences of impurities were also examined. Humid air impurities as low as 10 ppm in the helium can account for 79%-98% of the production of most RONS in the absence of an intentional admixture. The degree to which the impurities affect the RONS production depends on the electrode configuration and can be reduced by molecular admixtures.

Oxygen, a highly efficient electron acceptor with high reduction potential, facilitates highly efficient energy production in eukaryotic cells. However, the increasing atmospheric oxygen concentration produces new threats to the organism, as oxygen reacts with iron and produces reactive oxygen species unless its levels are strictly regulated. As the size of multicellular organisms increases, these organisms must transport oxygen to the peripheral tissues and begin to employ red blood cells containing hemoglobin. This system is potentially a double-edged sword, as hemoglobin autoxidation occurs at a certain speed and releases free iron into the cytoplasm. Nrf2 belongs to the CNC transcription factor family, in which NF-E2p45 is the founding member. NF-E2p45 was first identified as a transcription factor that binds to the erythroid gene regulatory element NF-E2 located in the promoter region of the heme biosynthetic porphobilinogen deaminase gene. Human Nrf2 was also identified as a transcription factor that binds to the regulatory region of the beta-globin gene. Despite these original findings, NF-E2p45 and Nrf2 knockout mice exhibit few erythroid phenotypes. Nrf2 regulates the expression of a wide range of antioxidant and detoxification enzymes. In this review article, we describe and discuss the roles of Nrf2 in various iron-mediated bioreactions and its possible coevolution with iron and oxygen.									24	0	0	0	20	0	24			2297-1769			WOS:000452232100001	30364139

Correlating particle formation profiles with O-2 evolution traces allowed homogeneous catalysis to be clearly distinguished from heterogeneous catalysis. A series of seven pyridine-alkoxide Cp*Ir complexes are shown to be fully homogeneous by SAXS, validating previous studies and confirming their catalysis to be molecular in nature throughout the reaction.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1867-3880	1867-3899		WOS:000485231500001

Controlling the mass transfer of Pt precursor in the electrolyte by varying the deposition potential enables the formation of various Pt particle shapes such as flower-like and polyhedral particles. Further control of the deposition parameters for pulse electrodeposition resulted in changes to the particle size and density. In particular, the upper potential of pulse was found to be the critical parameter controlling the morphology of the particles and their catalytic activity. In addition to the typical electrochemical measurements, Pt samples deposited on carbon paper were used as cathodes for a proton exchange membrane water electrolyser. This single cell test revealed that our Pt particle samples have exceptional mass activity while being cost effective. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Herein, by means of density functional theory (DFT) computations, we proposed that P- or S-doping can effectively activate the basal plane of graphdiyne (GDY) for the HER. Our results revealed that these P- or S-doped GDY materials exhibit outstanding stability, enhanced electrical conductivity, and excellent magnetic properties. More interestingly, by carefully controlling the site and type of the P or S heteroatom, GDY can exhibit superior catalytic performance for the HER with the hydrogen adsorption free energy (Delta G(H*)) being near zero, which can be attributed to its moderate p-band centers near the Fermi level. Our work highlights a novel metal-free electrocatalyst for the HER, providing a promising strategy to rationally design highly efficient HER catalysts for sustainable H-2 production.									5	2	0	0	0	0	5			1144-0546	1369-9261		WOS:000641081000001

The morphologies of Ni were also examined using SEM observation, X-ray diffraction, Hg porosimetry and BET surface area analyses. The surface roughening of the membrane was effctive to decrease anodic overpotentials, cathodic overpotentials and IR drops during the cell operation under the water feed and KOH feed to anodes owing to the expanded surface area and finer Ni paritcles. Increase in Ni loading amount was also effective to decrease anodic and cathodic overpotentials under KOH feed to anodes owing to high total surface area, while it was not effective to decrease the cell voltage under the water feed to anodes. These results may be explained as the differences in reaction zones for oxygen evolution and hydrogen evolution reactions.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0366-9297			WOS:A1994MQ97300011

Based on first-principles calculations, we herein propose a novel electrocatalyst comprising of totally nonmetal earth abundant elements (dual-Si doped g-C6N6 sheet) which is capable of activating N-2 and making it susceptible toward direct insertion of CO into the N-N bond, producing *NCON* which is the precursor for urea production by direct coupling of N-2 and CO2 followed by multiple proton coupled electron transfer processes. Remarkably, the calculated onset potential for urea production is much less than that of NH3 synthesis and hydrogen evolution reactions, and also the faradaic efficiency is nearly 100% for production urea over ammonia, which promotes exclusive electrocatalytic urea synthesis by suppressing the NH3 synthesis as well as hydrogen evolution reactions.									7	0	0	0	1	0	7			1948-7185			WOS:000719783300018	34726413

It was observed that the steam gasification of biomass char can be separated into two periods. Compared with the first period, in the second period (in which the relative mass of remaining char is smaller than 0.4) the gasification rate is increased. These effects are probably due to inherent potassium catalyst. Higher hydrogen partial pressure greatly inhibits the gasification of biomass char in the first and second periods. By calculating the first-order rate constants of char gasification in the first and second periods, we found that the hydrogen inhibition on biomass char gasification is caused by the reverse oxygen exchange reaction in the first period. In the second period, dissociative hydrogen adsorption on the char is the major inhibition reaction. The influence of levoglucosan, a major tar component derived from cellulose, was also examined. We found that not only hydrogen but also vapor-phase levoglucosan and its pyrolysates inhibited the steam gasification of woody biomass char. By mixing levoglucosan with woody biomass sample, the pyrolysis of char proceeds slightly more rapidly than with woody biomass alone, and gas evolution rates of H(2) and CO(2) are larger in steam gasification.

However, due to some distraction from the tubular structures, it remains a great challenge to calculate their Delta phi directly. Here, we creatively work out the Delta phi of Janus MoSSe armchair single walled nanotubes (A-SWNTs) with their corresponding building block models by first-principles calculations. The Delta phi increases as the diameter reduces. After considering Delta phi, we find that all of these MoSSe A-SWNTs possess suitable band edge positions required for water redox reactions and high solar-to-hydrogen (STH) conversion efficiencies. The built-in field induced by the Delta phi promotes the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) to proceed separately on the inner and outer surfaces. Especially, the photoexcited carriers exhibit adequate driving forces for OER and HER. Besides, constructing a double walled nanotube can dramatically increase Delta phi, which also further improves the separation and redox capacity of photoexcited carriers as well as the STH conversion efficiency. Moreover, all of these MoSSe armchair nanotubes have outstanding optical absorption in the visible light range. Our studies provide an effective strategy to improve the photocatalytic water-splitting performance of Janus TMD nanotubes.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0020-1669	1520-510X		WOS:000875690400001	36257300

Initially, the effect of calcination on the morphology, phase composition, and electrocatalytic behavior towards oxygen evolution reaction (OER) of the synthesized oxides was investigated. As the as-synthesized powder prepared at stoichiometric conditions (fuel-to-oxidizer ratio, phi = 1) and pH = 3 was calcined at 300 and 500 degrees C, the products became more compact and dense. XRD results showed that a subsequent heat treatment is required to produce a single phase-oxide, as the as-synthesized sample was a mixture of spinel Co3O4 and monoclinic CoO. The mixed phase oxide exhibited excellent electrocatalytic performance in 1 M KOH with onset overpotential and Tafel slope values as low as 361 mV and 87.54 mV dec(-1), respectively. Its enhanced properties compared to the calcined samples could be ascribed to its high specific surface area, lower crystallinity, and excellent porosity. Following such findings, uncalcined samples were produced with different phi, and pH values. At phi = 1 and pH = 1, the sample registered an onset overpotential and Tafel slope of 353 mV and 74.93 mV dec -1 , respectively. The sample produced at phi = 0.5 and pH = 3, exhibited the best OER catalytic activity with an onset overpotential and Tafel slope as low as 334 mV and 61. 77 mV dec(-1). Catalytic activity enhancement is possibly due to better control of phase composition and morphology achieved by employing fuel-lean (phi < 1) and acidic conditions. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

The oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is also the most important reaction in life processes and energy converting/storage systems. Developing techniques toward high-efficiency ORR remains highly desired and a challenge. Here, we report a N-doped carbon (NC) encapsulated CeO2/Co interfacial hollow structure (CeO2-Co-NC) via a generalized strategy for largely increased oxygen species adsorption and improved ORR activities. First, the metallic Co nanoparticles not only provide high conductivity but also serve as electron donors to largely create oxygen vacancies in CeO2. Second, the outer carbon layer can effectively protect cobalt from oxidation and dissociation in alkaline media and as well imparts its higher ORR activity. In the meanwhile, the electronic interactions between CeO2 and Co in the CeO2/Co interface are unveiled theoretically by density functional theory calculations to justify the increased oxygen absorption for ORR activity improvement. The reported CeO2-Co-NC hollow nanospheres not only exhibit decent ORR performance with a high onset potential (922 mV vs RHE), half-wave potential (797 mV vs RHE), and small Tafel slope (60 mV dec(-1)) comparable to those of the state-of-the-art Pt/C catalysts but also possess long-term stability with a negative shift of only 7 mV of the half-wave potential after 2000 cycles and strong tolerance against methanol. This work represents a solid step toward high-efficient oxygen reduction.									97	7	0	0	2	0	98			1936-0851	1936-086X		WOS:000428972600097	29529364

Na+ ions are less electrophilic than Li+ ions (softer Lewis bases). Thereby, oxygen reduction in the presence of Na+ ions may undergo a highly reversible one electron process to form sodium superoxide as a main product. However, sodium superoxide may have adverse effects on the stability and cycle life of sodium-oxygen batteries because of its high reactivity towards all kinds of relevant solvents. Therefore, sodium-oxygen batteries, in which the major oxygen reduction products are sodium peroxide moieties, may have an advantage in terms of better stability. This paper reports for the first time on sodium-oxygen batteries in which the cathodes comprise carbon nanotubes (CNTs) decorated with nanoparticles of ruthenium serving as a stationary catalyst. With these cathodes both oxygen reduction and evolution reactions are effectively catalyzed. The main oxygen reduction product on these CNT/Ru containing cathodes was deficient sodium peroxide, analyzed by XRD, XPS and SEM. Sodium-oxygen cells with Ru decorated CNT cathodes exhibited stable cycling performance over 100 cycles, while similar cells having CNT based cathodes showed much lower stability. It was clear that the limiting factor in the sodium-oxygen batteries containing CNT/Ru cathodes was the sodium anodes. Thereby it is believed that the present study is a step forward in the efforts to develop sodium-oxygen batteries.									18	2	0	0	0	0	18			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000412800300018

Herein, the interface engineering concept and nanoscale hollowing design were proposed to fabricate N-doping carbon nanoboxes confined with Co/ MoC nanoparticles. Uniform zeolitic imidazolate framework nanocube was employed as the starting material to construct the trifunctional electrocatalyst through the conformal polydopamine- Mo layer coating and the subsequent pyrolysis treatment. The Co@IC/MoC@PC catalyst displayed superior electrochemical ORR performances with a positive half-wave potential of 0.875 V and a high limiting current density of 5.89 mA/cm(2). When practically employed as an electrocatalyst in regenerative Zn-air battery, a high specific capacity of 728 mAh/g, a large peak power density of 221 mW/cm(2), a high open-circuit voltage of 1.482 V, and a low charge/discharge voltage gap of 0.41 V were obtained. Moreover, its practicability was further exploited by overall water splitting, affording low overpotentials of 277 and 68 mV at 10 mA/cm(2) for the OER and HER in 1 M KOH solution, respectively, and a decent operating potential of 1.57 V for EOWS. Ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy and density functional theory calculation revealed that the Co/MoC interface synergistically facilitated the charge-transfer, thereby contributing to the enhancements of electrocatalytic ORR/OER/HER processes. More importantly, this catalyst design concept can offer some interesting prospects for the construction of outstanding trifunctional catalysts toward various energy conversion and storage devices.									49	0	0	0	1	0	48			1936-0851	1936-086X		WOS:000693105500074	34346677

When considering the charge transfer pathways, PEC performance is governed by the charge kinetics at the EC/electrolyte and the semiconductor/EC interfaces. Here, systematic investigations are reported, made on the overall kinetics of the PEC hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in an alkaline electrolyte. A non-stoichiometric (Ni-rich) NiOx (x < 1) EC is deposited on a Si photocathode passivated with a SiOx layer. A few distinctive features of the Ni-rich NiOx film are identified in contrast with the conventional O-rich NiOy (y >= 1) which could lower the series resistance along the charge transfer pathways. The Ni-rich NiOx is found to possess both NiO and Ni-Ni (by oxygen-vacancy) bonds, which act as suitable catalytic sites for dissociating water molecules and recombining two hydrogen atoms, respectively. In addition, the Ni-rich NiOx reveals both n-type and metallic conduction behavior, a feature that may contribute to lowering bulk resistance as well as tunneling resistance through SiOx layer. As a result, this noble metal-free EC-integrated Si photocathode achieves the highest potential of 0.41 V vs. reversible hydrogen electrode to produce a photocurrent density of 10 mA cm(2).									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			2366-7486			WOS:000424712800006

Mixed metal iridium oxide catalysts (AIr(x)O(y), A = nonprecious metal) have demonstrated superior oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity relative to IrO2 catalysts while utilizing less Ir. However, improved stability is required if these materials are to be implemented commercially. In this work, we use a combination of ex situ and in situ characterization techniques to study physical and electronic properties of Y2Ir2O7 as it evolves during OER in acidic electrolyte. We identify and quantify dissolution of Y and Ir, finding that this material exhibits similar stability to other reported mixed metal Ir oxides (10(4)-10(5) molO(2) evolved/molIr dissolved) and appears to become more stable over time. We find that the catalyst surface becomes enriched with Ir after electrochemical testing. We further monitored the Ir oxidation state in situ using high-energy resolution fluorescence detected X-ray absorption spectroscopy. Our results suggest that the Ir oxidation state is dynamic: an IrOx surface forms that is more oxidized than the bulk pyrochlore material but subsequently dissolves. Such detailed characterization of material properties can be used to develop design principles for improving catalyst stability.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			1932-7447	1932-7455		WOS:000746684300001

Herein, we report a simple method to produce nickel-carbon nanotube (CNT) nanocomposites by CVD method using nickel acetate alcogel. The molar concentration of nickel in acetate alcogel was observed to be controlling factor for the growth of extremely small nickel nanoparticles of the order 2-5 nm in diameter on the tips and walls of the CNTs. Moreover, it was found experimentally that the higher concentration of nickel in acetate alcogel nucleated predominantly big-faceted globular particles presumably composed of nickel nanocrystals of the order 50-1000 nm in diameter and scarce CNTs of the diameter 40-80 nm. In addition, oxygen evolution reaction activities of sample synthesized by CVD of carbon using 0.333 molar nickel in acetate alcogel was found to better than the sample with 0.495 molar concentration of nickel in acetate gel. The better OER performance of the sample was attributed to the presence well-separated distribution of catalytic nickel nanoparticles on the electrically conductive CNTs.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			0947-8396	1432-0630		WOS:000692732700009

Herein, we successfully prepared nanosheet-like Co-3(OH)(2)(HPO4)(2) (namely, Co-OH-HPi) material via a facile one-pot poly(vinylpyrrolidone) surfactant-assisted hydrothermal method. The obtained Co-OH-HPi catalyst displays a high electrocatalytic activity for the OER in 1.0 M potassium hydroxide media with an overpotential of 290 mV, m at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) (eta(@10) (-2)(mA cm)) and a small Tafel slope of 82 mV dec(-1), which is comparable to the commercial RuO2 and most recently reported nonprecious monometal phosphates OER catalysts in alkaline condition. The superior electrocatalytic activity might be ascribed to the synergistic effect of large BET surface area and fast motion of electron as well as proton transfer in nanosheet Co-OH-HPi phosphate with different proton acceptors (e.g., OH- and HPO42-). In addition, this electrode material shows high stability and keeps a current density of 92% at a continuous water splitting over more than 11 h in 1.0 M KOH solution.									25	2	0	0	3	0	25			2168-0485			WOS:000458086100026

Here, we found that Pt thin layers situated on nanostructured NiOx supported on graphene sheets show significantly higher activity for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in both acid and alkaline conditions. The NiOx could dramatically boost the HER activity of the on-top situated ultrathin Pt layer. The NiOx@Pt core-shell structure displays overpotentials of only 22 and 38.3 mV at 10 mA cm-2 for HER in alkaline and acid electrolytes, respectively, significantly lower than commercial Pt/C. The enhanced activity can be attributed to the monolayer nature of Pt and the bifunctional mechanism between the NiOx and Pt, which activate the Pt active sites by the NiOx sublayer.

To solve this issue, a reconstructed amorphous FeCoNiSx electrocatalyst with high density of efficient active sites, yielding low OER overpotentials of 202, 255, and 323mV at 10, 100, and 500mAcm-2 , respectively, is developed for fast-charging Zn-air batteries with low charging voltages at 100-400mAcm-2 . Furthermore, the fabricated 3241.8mAh (20mAcm-2 , 25°C) quasi-solid Zn-air battery shows long lifetime of 500h at -10 and 25°C as well as 150h at 40°C under charging 100mAcm-2 . The detailed characterizations combine with density functional theory calculations indicate that the defect-rich crystalline/amorphous ternary metal (oxy)hydroxide forms by the reconstruction of amorphous multi-metallic sulfide, where the electron coupling effect among multi-active sites and migration of intermediate O* from Ni site to the Fe site breaks the scaling relationship to lead to a low theoretical OER overpotential of 170mV, accounting for the outstanding fast-charging property. This work not only provides insights into designing advanced OER catalysts by the self-reconstruction of the pre-catalyst but also pioneers a pathway for practical fast-charging Zn-air batteries.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0				1521-4095		MEDLINE:36177691	36177691

However, the preparation processes of these materials are usually cumbersome and have a low yield, which eliminates their most critical advantage of being low cost. We propose a method for rapidly and efficiently preparing porous (Ni0.5Fe0.5)C2O4 nanorods with an excellent OER catalytic performance. The overpotential of (Ni0.5Fe0.5)C2O4 is 266 mV at 20 mA cm(-2) under alkaline conditions, and the Tafel slope is 54.39 mV dec(-1). Furthermore, analysis of the changes in the surface properties of the material before and after catalysis determined that the real active material is (Ni0.5Fe0.5)(OH)(x)(C2O4)(1-x). Using a simple scaled-up experiment, (Ni0.5Fe0.5)C2O4 is mass-produced (40 g) via direct synthesis in 5 min. The composition and performance of the mass-produced sample are analysed under the same conditions, and (Ni0.5Fe0.5)C2O4 still has a good catalytic performance and its composition has not changed. The efficient synthesis of (Ni0.5Fe0.5)C2O4 nanorods with a porous structure provides a new option for the development of commercial catalysts using non-precious metals.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			1144-0546	1369-9261		WOS:000727336500001

Herein, we report active and robust OER catalysts of Fe3+-doped beta-Ni(OH)(2) prepared via an atomic-scale topochemical transformation route. Based on the premise that all Fe3+ is incorporated into the beta-Ni(OH)(2) lattice, the OER activity increases directly with the content of Fe3+. The Fe(0.5)-doped beta-Ni(OH)(2) catalyst affords a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at an overpotential as low as 0.26 V and a small Tafel slope of 32 mv dec(-1). Comparing the state-of-the-art IrO2 catalyst, the Fe(0.5)-doped beta-Ni(OH)(2) catalyst exhibits higher activity and stability from galvanostatic tests at 10 mA cm(-2). Additionally, we experimentally demonstrate that Fe(0.5)-doped beta-Ni(OH)(2) exerts higher OER activity than Fe(0.5)-doped alpha-Ni(OH)(2). All evidence indicates that Fe and the beta-Ni(OH)(2) matrix play an important role in NiFe-based catalysts.									58	4	0	0	0	0	60			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000400553700009

Under anaerobic conditions, NO2- was reduced by strongly illuminating chloroplast to form NO. However when kept in dark or when illuminated without DPC, no NO signal could be detected in the reaction system.

It was found that the time of storage of this solvent affects the oxidation overpotentials of the reduction products. It is suggested that the reason for the PEGDME500 change originates from the synthesis process, in which the sodium alcoholate molecule can remain in the solvent. Insertion of metallic sodium prevents aging of PEGDME500. The results are compared with a tetraethylene glycol dimethyl ether (TEGDME)-based electrolyte. It was shown that the voltammogram of the TEGDME-based electrolyte is similar to that of the fresh PEGDME500, but with the opposite ratio of NaO2-to-Na2O2 oxidation currents. This indicates that Na2O2 is the main reduction product in TEGDME, and we suggest that in fresh PEGDME500, Na2O2 is formed by the chemical disproportionation of the dissolved NaO2 in the solution.									10	2	0	0	0	0	10			1432-8488	1433-0768		WOS:000427805100006

The synthesis of such sub-micron box starts with the preparation of the hollow oxide sub-micron box and is followed by a phosphorization process. It is proven that the selective etching induces by cation exchange (Zn2+ and Co2+) was the key to the formation of the hollow structure. The analysis of chemical states and electrochemical activity further reveals Zn enhanced the intrinsic activity of catalysts by increasing the electron density of Co in final products. The optimized ZnCo-OP hollow sub-micron box exhibits good HER activity with overpotentials of 112 mV at 10 mA/cm(2) and 197 mV at 250 mA/cm(2).									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			2365-6549			WOS:000618784100026

LaFeO3 with crystallite domains in the range of 60 nm are prepared by thermolysis of an ionic-liquid precursor and subsequently deposited onto FTO electrode by spin-coating. Deposition of a TiO2 layer by solution-based methods leads to the formation of a heterojunction, attenuating dark current associated with hole-transfer (water oxidation) at potential above 1.4 V. The LFO/TiO2 heterojunction features photocurrent onset potential for the hydrogen evolution reaction of 1.47 V vs. the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE), which is one of the most positive values reported for a single absorber. Deposition of Pt nanoparticles at the LFO/TiO2 heterostructure generates a significant increase in the HER photocurrent, although bulk recombination remains an important challenge in these constructs.

We show herein for the first time that manganese impurities in graphene can improve the catalytic activity of synthesized N-doped graphene (NG) for the hydrogen evolution reaction in acid media by influencing the ratio of different N-functionalities. A 122 mV improvement in the overpotential was found following the Mn impregnation of graphene. Transmission electron microscopy images confirmed the formation of manganese oxide nanoparticles on the NG sheets. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy revealed structural alteration in favor of higher quantities of quaternary and pyrrolic nitrogen functionalities, from approximately 37% in NG to 84% in the Mn-inserted-doped graphene catalyst. This enhanced catalytic performance, based on density functional theory calculations in the literature, was attributed to an increase in the number of active sites with higher activity.									5	1	0	0	0	1	5			1867-3880	1867-3899		WOS:000417441400006

The phase transition and morphology change of NixPy compounds were investigated via X-ray diffraction (XRD), inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometry (ICP), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The results showed that two different crystalline phases of NixPy compound could be obtained only by adjusting the amount of addition of urea. Moreover, the micro-morphology varied from irregular bulks to fold, beehive-like shape and then to particle-aggregated and finally to a 3D-network with an increase in the amount of urea, which exhibited much higher hydrodechlorination (HDC) activity on trichloroethylene (TCE) than Ni2P without addition of urea. In a word, adding urea is a facile way to prepare NixPy compounds with a controllable crystalline phase and micro-morphology.									8	1	0	0	0	0	8			1144-0546	1369-9261		WOS:000407304100081

Particulate photocatalyst sheets for Z-scheme water splitting can be printed at low cost using inks containing a hydrogen evolution photocatalyst (HEP), an oxygen evolution photocatalyst (OEP), and conductive metal nanoparticles, and can be applied to large areas. However, the metal nanoparticles lead to backward reactions and light absorption. Herein, we demonstrate printable photocatalyst sheets composed of SrTiO3: La, Rh as the HEP, BiVO4: Mo as the OEP, and nanoparticulate indium tin oxide as a transparent and electrochemically inert conductor, for efficient pure-water splitting. The photocatalyst sheets decompose water with a solar-to-hydrogen energy conversion efficiency of 0.4%, which is one of the highest values among Z-scheme overall water-splitting systems prepared without the requirement for a vacuum process. Printable and efficient photocatalyst sheets obtained using cost-effective and readily extensible procedures spread opportunities toward practical solar hydrogen production via the water-splitting reaction.									37	1	0	0	2	0	37			2542-4351			WOS:000453896100018

Here, we successfully prepared hollow CoNiS polyhedrons/MnCoNi layered double hydroxide (MCN LDH) nanorod arrays on Ni foam (labeled as CNS/MCN LDH/NF) through a two-step wet chemical route, employing NF-supported MCN LDH nanoneedle arrays as the substrate. ZIF-67 polyhedrons first loaded on MCN LDH to form ZIF-67/MCN LDH/NF, and then ZIF-67/MCN LDH/NF was sulfurized to obtain the final product. The investigations revealed that MCN LDH could not be sulfurized under the current sulfurization conditions and simultaneously nickel element entered the sulfurized product to form hollow CoNiS polyhedrons. Electrochemical tests showed that the as-obtained CNS/MCN LDH/NF electrode merely required 259 mV of overpotential in 1.0 M KOH solution to deliver the current density of 50 mA cm(-2), which was lower than 372 mV of the hollow Co(9)S(8)polyhedrons/NF electrode. Furthermore, the as-constructed CNS/MCN LDH/NF electrode could continuously and stably work at the current density of 100 mA cm(-2)for 110 h, indicating its superb long-term stability.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1932-2135	1932-2143		WOS:000784540800001

For this purpose, a two dimensional (2D) heterostructure of Co3O4 and Co3S4 is prepared following a simple multi-step method that incorporates a wet-chemical technique followed by a hydrothermal method. Initially, 2D sheets of Co3O4 are synthesized using the wet-chemical method followed by calcination. Finally, the heterostructure Co3O4@Co3S4 is fabricated from the Co3O4 sheets following a simple Kirkendall process through sulfurization for electrochemical application. Slow anion exchange leads to development of a hollow core@shell 2D Co3O4@Co3S4 heterostructure. After sulfidation, the heterostructure of 2D sheets shows excellent conductivity and improved electrocatalytic activity for the OER compared to bare Co3O4. The best-obtained Co3O4@Co3S4 can produce a 20 mA cm(-2) current density upon application of 1.647 V vs. RHE, which is similar to 100 mV lower compared to bare Co3O4. Sulfidation of Co3O4 leads to the formation of hollow heterostructures with a similar to 2.8 times higher electrochemically active surface area. Co3O4@Co3S4 is very stable, and it can produce an unaltered current density up to 1000 continuous cycles in the OER.									13	0	0	0	2	0	13			1144-0546	1369-9261		WOS:000489157400027

Mesoporous Ni0.8Fe0.2 film self-supported on stainless steel mesh (SW was prepared via a novel hydrothermal electrodeposition process. Hydrothermally driven electrodeposition method showed significant advantages toward OER: (1) high temperature makes H-2 generated on the cathode to overflow faster. Both the gas generated on the cathode and hydrothermal condition impacted coating surface, hence, the film possessed more active sites to improve OER properties and (2) hydrothermal condition improved the crystallization of the coating leading to excellent electrode stability under OER test. The mesoporous Ni0.8Fe0.2 film exhibited an overpotential of 206 my at 10 mA cm(-2) (i.e., 1.436 V vs. RHE), a Tafel slope of 64 mV dec(-1) and excellent stability after 2 x 10(5)s (more than 55 h) at 10 mA cm(-2). The superior OER properties could be attributed to the film's novel synthetic process, porous structure and high electrical conductivity. This work shows a new strategy to fabricate mesoporous alloy films as OER catalysts.									63	5	0	0	3	0	63			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000434888600024

Herein, we fabricate a MnO2-carbon nanoparticle hybrid composite (MO-CNP) by applying the plasma discharge in the single precursor of purple benzene. This synthesis route facilitates a simultaneous formation of MnO2 and carbon, which induced a homogeneously mixed and firmly anchored hybrid composite. As a result, as-obtained MO-CNP-1 shows more than 12 times higher electrical conductivity than that of prepared conventionally. Thus, formation of MO-CNP could be accompanied by a synergy between MnO2 and CNP as electrocatalyst, and consequently, electrochemical properties were significantly improved. In comparison with CNP, the ORR potential of MO-CNP-1 was positively shifted from -0.28 to -0.23V (vs. Ag/AgCl), and current density has increased more than 2 times. Although the ORR activity of MO-CNP-1 was still far a little short of the commercial Pt/C, the MO-CNP-1 indicated significant higher OER activity, which demonstrated excellent overall catalytic capability of MO-CNP-1 as bifunctional catalyst.									8	0	0	0	1	0	8			2365-6549			WOS:000435933100005

Electrocatalyst research so far has focused on crystal rather than amorphous due to poor conductivity. Here, we demonstrate that the amorphous electrocatalyst made of 3D honeycomb-like amorphous nickel hydroxide (Ni(OH)(2)) nanosheets synthesized by a simple, facile, green, and low-cost electrochemistry technique possesses ultrahigh activity and super-long-term cycle stability in the oxygen evolution ieaction (OER). The amorphous Ni(OH)(2) affords a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at an overpotential of a mere 0.344 V and a small Tafel slope of 46 mV/dec, while no deactivation is detected in the CV cycles even up to 5000 times. We also establish that the short-range order, i.e., nanophase, of amorphous creates a lot of active sites for OER, which can greatly promote the electrochemical performance of amorphous catalysts. These findings show that the conventional understanding of selecting electrocatalysts with conductivity as a typical reference standard seems out of date for developing new catalysts at the nanometer, which opens a door ever closed to applications of amorphous nanomaterials as advanced catalysts for water oxidation.									42	6	0	0	2	0	45			1528-7483	1528-7505		WOS:000360867300034

Herein, the defect-enriched multistage morphology Ni-Fe-P-Ni3S2 heterogeneous catalyst growth on the Ni Foam (Ni-Fe-P-Ni3S2 /NF) is synthesized for the first time through electroless composite plating. Attributed to the heterogeneous structure between Ni-Fe-P alloys and Ni3S2 , abundant lattice defects, exposed highly open multistage skeleton morphology, the optimal Ni-Fe-P-Ni3S2 /NF catalyst only requires 65 and 219 mV to reach the current density of 10 mA cm(-2) towards HER and OER in alkaline solution, respectively. With regard to the overall water splitting, the alkaline electrolyzer assembled by Ni-Fe-P-Ni3S2 /NF electrodes exhibits a low cell voltage of 1.5 V at 10 mA cm(-2).

Benefiting from sacrifice of zinc and the transformation of cobalt, the constructed ZnO-CoOx catalysts possess larger electrochemically active surface area (ECSA) and sufficient exposure of active cites for water oxidation. Accordingly, the electrochemical double-layer capacitance (Cdl) of ZnO-CoOx catalysts is proved to be 106.9 mF cm (2), which is much larger than that of the corresponding zinc sacrifice-free sample (Co-NZ/CPEC, C-dl = 13.0 mF cm (2)). Moreover, the substrate (denoted as CPEC) is fabricated on copper plate by electrochemical corrosion and chemical reduction to get better wettability, which makes the substrate load catalysts more easily and tightly. Besides, the insitu growth of active materials greatly facilitates the electron transfer efficiency between the substrate and catalysts. Thus, the prepared ZnO-CoOx/CPEC electrode shows enhanced OER activity (eta(j) = 10 m A cm (2) = 276 mV) and desirable durability (current retention >92% after electrolysis of 24 h) compared with the conventional Co-based catalysts.

NANO ENERGY				62				601	609		10.1016/j.nanoen.2019.05.045				AUG 2019	2019	Improving the slow kinetics of hydrogen evolution/oxidation reaction(HER/HOR) on Pt in the alkaline electrolyte is key to the development of water splitting and hydroxide exchange membrane fuel cells, which feature a potential cost advantage over their acid-operating counterparts. However, it is still unconfirmed whether adsorbed surface hydroxyl species (OHad) plays a significant role in determining HER/HOR activity. Moreover, the active sites should be different in the alkaline due to the sluggish reaction rate. In the present work, electrochemical tests have shown that for modified bulk Pt surface and Pt3Ni nanoalloy, HER rate is co-determined by the oxophilic effect and electronic effect, while the rate of HOR is associated with the electronic effect. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal the fundamentally different HER and HOR mechanism of Pt-based nanoparticles, and the surface charge may account for such difference. Finally, the adsorption and oxidation of carbon monoxide (CO) as a novel descriptor are provided to predicate the activity of HER and HOR.									43	2	0	0	2	0	43			2211-2855	2211-3282		WOS:000474636100063

Compared to commercial Li-ion battery (LIB), lithium-air battery (LAB) is a promising next generation energy storage system with high energy density and environmental friendliness. The theoretical energy density of lithium-air battery is about 3500 Wh kg(-1), which is much higher than Li-ion battery. The reaction principle of lithium-air batteries includes the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) on the air electrode, which correspondingly involves the formation and decomposition of lithium peroxide (Li2O2) during the discharge and charge processes, respectively. However, the slow dynamic process of cathode electrochemical reactions results in high discharge and charge overpotential, low energy efficiency and poor rate performance of lithium-air batteries. And the instability of catalysts also leads to short cycle life of batteries. The carbon-based catalysts could react with discharge products to form an insulating lithium carbonate layer, resulting in catalysts passivation and capacity fading. Therefore, the development of efficient and stable cathode catalysts with high electrical conductivity, rational structure, and highly efficient bifunctional activity for both ORR and OER is highly required to address the above issues.In this review, the research progress of catalysts for the cathode of lithium-air batteries in recent years have been reviewed. The remaining challenges of cathode catalysts for lithium-air batteries are discussed, and the design of ideal cathode catalysts with high electronic conductivity, porous structure and abundant active sites in the future is proposed. The reaction mechanism of catalyst, and the regulation of catalysts/discharge products interface are of great significance for the future development of efficient and practical lithium-air batteries.									2	1	0	0	0	0	2			0023-074X	2095-9419		WOS:000503249700008

Au nanoparticle cocatalyst remarkably enhances photocatalytic activity of C3N4 for H2O2 production. Due to the inert nature to catalyze the decomposition of H2O2, Au/C3N4 also exhibits stable H2O2 evolution rate. It is of great interest that the maximal H2O2 production activity is reached at the loading amount of Au as low as 0.01%, revealing the great catalytic efficacy of highly dispersed Au cocatalyst during the photocatalytic H2O2 synthesis and the possibility to produce concentrated H2O2 using C3N4 with extremely low Au loading amount. The in situ electron spin resonance studies reveal that the H2O2 is produced through direct 2e(-) oxygen reduction over Au/C3N4 photocatalyst.									31	1	0	0	5	0	31			1566-7367	1873-3905		WOS:000463124300014

Thus, we successfully designed a new strategy and synthesized transition-metal-based 3D metal-organic framework (MOF) materials having various architectures, namely, Cu-BTC, Co-BTC, and Ni-BTC, by pulsed laser ablation in dimethylformamide. The coordination between the metal and carboxylate moieties of the ligand, crystalline structure, phase purity, morphology, thermal stability, and oxidation states were illustrated using physical characterization techniques. Further, intrinsic properties of the MOF materials were studied using electrocatalytic reactions toward HER and OER in an alkaline medium. Among the synthesized MOF materials, the Co-BTC electrocatalyst showed a very low overpotential of 437 mV toward HER at a constant current density of 10 mA cm(-2) in 1.0 M potassium hydroxide. The derived Tafel slope and R-ct values are 115.1 mV dec(-1) and 2.77 omega cm(-2), respectively. Similarly, OER studies reveal that the Co-BTC MOF showed robust activity with low overpotential of 370 mV at 10 mA cm(-2). Finally, the optimal Co-BTC MOF electrode required 2.03 V of cell potential to deliver 10 mA cm(-2) in a dielectrode (Co-BTC || Co-BTC) electrolysis system with long-run stability. The present report reveals a new possibility for the innovation in robust HER and OER bifunctional electrocatalysts using nonprecious metallic MOF materials.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000806979400003

Herein, an simple and effective caffeic acid-assisted solvothermal method was developed to grow Fe-based metal-organic framework (NH2-MIL-88B(Fe)) overlayer onto the Mo-doped BiVO4 for efficient PEC water oxidation. The synergistic role of Fe-MOF cocatalyst and Mo dopant resulted in a 3.5-fold photocurrent density (1.46 mA cm-2) increase in comparison with bare BiVO4 (0.46 mA cm-2) at 1.23 V [vs. reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE)] and showed an obviously negative shift of the onset potential (200 mV). The enhanced PEC performance can be attributed to the improved charge separation and injection efficiency with Mo doping and Fe-MOF coating, the introduction of Fe-MOF also increased the utilization of visible-light and served as an efficient electrocatalyst to accelerate the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) kinetics. This work provides a universal strategy for constructing semiconductor/MOFs photoanodes for enhanced photoelectrochemical water splitting.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1010-6030	1873-2666		WOS:000831727700003

The CuO NF@G/CF electrode exhibits a small overpotential of 320 mV to drive a current density of 10 mA cm(-2)with a low Tafel slope of 63.1 mV dec(-1). This enhancement in OER performance stems from the synergistic effect between highly conductive graphene and hierarchically porous CuO nanoflowers with a number of high-density active sites and open spaces.									16	2	0	0	1	0	16			1359-7345	1364-548X		WOS:000555234200003	32749394

In our model the water is treated as explicitly adsorbed H2O molecules, which are found to form two-dimensional water chains (layers) on all investigated oxide surfaces. The first chain formed by the most strongly bound H2O molecules is adsorbed on the 5-fold coordinated surface metal atoms. The second chain is composed of less strongly bound H2O molecules binding to bridging oxygens. The third chain interacts weakly and predominantly with the H2O molecules of the second layer, resembling bulk water. We find that the stability of the water layer close to the oxide surface is almost the same as the one found on flat metal surfaces, such as the Pt(111) surface, despite the highly different adsorption pattern of the water molecules. We show that the presence of a water network has some effect on the interaction of individual intermediates of the OER with the oxide surface. However, the theoretical OER overpotential remains almost unchanged in the case of RuO2 and IrO2, while it is increased by similar to 0.4 eV for TiO2.									51	2	0	0	2	0	53			1932-7447			WOS:000348094000019

Herein, carbon cloth supported N-doped porous carbon wrapped Co nanoparticles (CC@Co-NPC) are constructed with high bifunctional catalytic activity toward oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in alkaline medium. Benefiting from the exposure of abundant Co active sites, and the synergistic effect between Co particles and N-doped carbon species, the CC@Co-NPC delivers small overpotentials of 286 and 340 mV at 100 mA cm(-2) with Tafel values of 59 and 97 mV dec(-1) towards OER and HER, respectively. Remarkably, when coupled as CC@Co-NPC||CC@Co-NPC cell, only a small voltage of 1.49 V is required to achieve 10 mA cm(-2), making CC@Co-NPC a potential bifunctional catalyst for overall water splitting.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			1867-3880	1867-3899		WOS:000621343200001

Developing earth-abundant, highly efficient and durable OER catalysts has faced huge challenges until now, because OER is a strict kinetic sluggish process. Herein, we report the construction of hierarchically porous graphitized carbon (HPGC) supported NiFe layered double hydroxides (LDHs) with a core-shell structure (denoted as HPGC@NiFe) by a facile strategy. The HPGC was first obtained by pyrolysing phenolic resin nanospheres with FeCl3 and ZnCl2 as the catalyst and the activator, respectively. Then the NiFe LDH arrays were directly grown on the HPGC by a one-step hydrothermal method. The as-synthesized HPGC@NiFe reveals excellent OER properties with a low onset potential, a lower overpotential of 265 mV (corresponding to the current density at 10 mA cm(-2)) and a small Tafel slope (56 mV per decade). And its catalytic activity is even superior to that of the start-of-the-art noble-metal catalyst IrO2/C. Notably, the HPGC@NiFe electrode shows admirable stability measured by performing 2000 cycle CVs and long-term electrolysis for 50 h. The prominent performance can be attributed to the synergistic effect between the NiFe-LDHs and the hierarchically porous graphitized carbon, in which the former can increase the exposure of the active sites, while the latter can increase the charge transfer efficiency. Our research implies the possibility for the development of low-cost layered double hydroxides as a promising candidate in electrochemical energy storage and conversion equipment.									74	2	0	0	4	0	74			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000407812000027	28770917

In this hybrid battery, the cathode material is composed of oxygen-vacancy-rich Co3O4-x and N, S-co-doped carbon derived from a metal-organic framework; a Zn plate acts as the anode. With a current of 1 A g(-1), the specific capacity of the cathode material achieves 144 mA h g(-1). A four-electron process dominates the oxygen reduction reaction of the cathode material with a half wave potential of 0.78 V. In the oxygen evolution reaction, the eta(10) potential of the cathode material is merely 365 mV. When discharged at 1 mA cm(-2), the hybrid Zn battery shows two discharge plateaus at 1.75 V and 1.11 V. Its specific capacity and energy density reach 711 mA h g(-1) and 810 W h kg(-1), respectively. This battery also inherits superior power density from the Zn-Co3O4 battery. Its peak power density occurs at 43.6 mW cm(-2), and this value is obviously higher than that of the Zn-air battery built from the same cathode material. The hybrid battery also exhibits excellent stability with a capacity and charge-discharge voltage that are well maintained after long time periods. This study integrates two distinct batteries into one power source to develop a hybrid Zn battery, which possesses high voltage, specific capacity and superior power and energy densities.									17	1	0	0	0	0	17			1477-9226	1477-9234		WOS:000527534400012	32067010

Herein, electrochemical and toxicity studies of six MAX and MAB phases (Ti2AlC, Ti2AlN, Ti3AlC2, Ti3SiC2, Cr2AlB2, and MoAIB) were explored. The materials were found to possess high heterogeneous electron transfer (HET) rates, enhanced electrochemical sensing of ascorbic acid and uric acid, and promising electrocatalytic performances toward hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). MAB phases possessed better electrochemical properties than did MAX phases. In addition, in vitro cytotoxicity studies toward various human cells found near negligible toxicity toward the cells tested deeming them safe for handling and biocompatible for future biological applications. Therefore, MAX and MAB phases can be regarded as safe layered materials for potential electrochemical applications.									26	0	0	0	0	0	26			2574-0970			WOS:000488423900074

The deposition and decomposition behaviors of discharge products, the voltage, and capacity evolutions during the cycling operation of the Li-air batteries are investigated. The deposition behavior analysis implies that the Li2CO3 generated by electrolyte decomposition is mainly distributed near the separator side, while it is dominantly generated by Li-O-2/CO2 reaction near the air side. The formation of Li2CO3 by side reactions makes the Li-air batteries exhibit a peak discharge deposition inside the cathode. Moreover, Li2CO3 is difficult to decompose and gradually accumulates with cycles, especially near the air side. The severe accumulation of Li2CO3 near the air side significantly reduces the O-2 diffusion into the electrode, which induces severe cycling performance decay of the Li-air batteries. According to the distribution and evolution of the deposition, three simple hierarchical cathode structures with high porosities near the air side are finally studied. The simulation results indicate that the increase of the local porosity near the air side substantially improves the cycling performance of the Li-air batteries.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			1432-8488	1433-0768		WOS:000692070200001

The effects of the annealing conditions on the produced phase were studied. From the changes of the lattice constant and the chemical composition, it was found that the spinel oxides prepared by high-temperature calcination were oxidized by the low-temperature annealing. The change in the oxidation degree during the low-temperature annealing decreased with an increase in the Li/Mn molar ratio. The effect of the preparation conditions on the reversible Li-intercalation/deintercalation reaction was also examined from the view points of the oxygen deficiency. These experimental results implied that the cycle performance in the oxygen-deficient Li-Mn spinel oxide was improved by the low-temperature annealing, and that the cycle performance of Li-Mn spinel oxide cathode depended on the oxygen stoichiometry rather than the Li/Mn molar ratio. However, it was found that the complete recovery of the oxygen defect structure was impossible when the oxygen deficiency was large enough. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

Coral-like Ni2P-Ni5P4 polymorphs with observable heterointerfaces were synthesized via hydrothermal method followed by low-temperature phosphidation. The phase structures and the electronic interaction of the heterointerfaces have been identified by X-ray diffraction and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. The resulting Ni2P-Ni5P4 catalyst exhibited a reasonable overpotential of 107 mV and a superior low overpotential of 238 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) for hydrogen evolution reaction and oxygen evolution reaction in 1 M KOH, respectively. In addition, excellent water-splitting performance of 10 mA cm(-2) at a low overpotential of 348 mV was obtained by combining the Ni2P-Ni5P4/NF as both cathode and anode, which is lower than that of the Pt/C and RuO2 catalyst couple. Such impressive performance might be ascribed to effective heterointerfaces of Ni2P-Ni5P4 polymorphs.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2162-8769	2162-8777		WOS:000687476900001

Herein, a one-step cyclic voltammetric electrodeposition method was adopted to synthesize a low-crystallinity NiFeCoPi/P catalyst by adding Fe and Co to NiPi/P. The synthesized NiFeCoPi/P catalyst exhibits good catalytic performance for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in 1 M NaOH and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in 0.5 M Na2CO3/NaHCO3, showing low overpotentials of 98 and 299 mV for HER and OER at 10 mA cm(-2), respectively. Also, the electrodeposition only requires a cell voltage of 1.63 V for overall water splitting. It could be found that the introduction of Fe and Co can enhance charge transport among the metals and can effectively change the morphology of the catalyst, thus increasing the electrocatalytic performance for HER and OER. Moreover, the NiFeCoPi/P catalyst reveals good stability in the electrolysis process of overall water splitting.									11	1	0	0	0	0	12			0888-5885			WOS:000619636600010

In this paper, a bifunctional (ORR/OER) electrocatalysts, metal sulfide nanoparticles anchored N, S co-doped porous carbon nanofibers were successfully synthesized by a simultaneous carbonization and sulfurization of ZIFs/PAN electrospun composite nanofibers. The as-prepared material Zn/Co-ZIFs/PAN-CS-800 catalyst exhibited an excellent electrocatalytic performance in both ORR and OER. Such excellent ORR and OER performance comes from the active metal sulfide species, N, S co-doping effect, porous structure, and good conductivity.

The amounts of CO + CO2 desorbed during TPD also increase with temperature and duration of oxidation for relatively mild oxidative treatments (temperature below similar to 723K). Upon further increase of the oxidation temperature the amount of CO + CO2 decrease and the ratio of CO/CO2 increases remarkably. Altogether, results suggest the existence of a strong link between a remarkable shift of surface oxides from epoxy to ether/carbonyl and the desorption of CO and CO2. Moreover, the CO/CO2 ratio during desorption can be well correlated with the relative abundance and stability of epoxy moieties with respect to the "edge" oxides. Results are analyzed in the frame of a semi-lumped kinetic model of carbon oxidation with a focus on the role and nature of surface oxides as intermediates in carbon gasification reactions.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			1364-0321	1879-0690		WOS:000625292500040

J	[Anonymous]								Fabrication of efficient electrocatalytic system with ruthenium cobalt sulfide over a carbon cloth								Journal of Industrial and Engineering Chemistry				113				316	324		10.1016/j.jiec.2022.06.005				2022	2022	Probing effective, highly active, and inexpensive electrocatalysts for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is ofimmense importance for water electrolysis. Transition metal chalcogenides have been developed as anew class of materials for energy storage and conversion owing to their distinctive properties, such ascapacitance, conductivity, and redox behavior. Three-dimensional carbon cloth (CC), is a unique carbonnetwork with extraordinary flexibility, mechanical stability, and high conductivity for application inenergy-conversion systems. In this study, we designed ruthenium cobalt sulfide over a carbon cloth(RuCoS2/CC) via electrodeposition followed by an immersion technique and applied it for the OER. Themolar ratio for Ru (amount of Ru – 10, 20, 30 mg & immersion time – 3, 6, and 9 h), Co (0.05 to0.3 M), and S (0.05 to 0.2 M) precursors were optimized. Owing to the existence of binary active sites,heteroatoms, and synergetic effect between the transition metal chalcogenides and the carbon substrate,Ru (20 mg immersed for 6 h) at CoS2 (Co – 0.2 M & S2 0.05 M) modified CC (shortly denoted as RuCoS2/CC) exhibits a lower overpotential (315 mV), better Tafel slope (74 mV dec 1), and excellent durability(retention rate 94.64%) compared with CoS2/CC and previous studies. Therefore, RuCoS2/CC is perceivedto show better OER performance in the electrocatalysis of water.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1226-086X			KJD:ART002878434

In this study, we present a facile means to integrate ZnCo2O4 submicro/nanospheres with CoxSey (x and y denote the molar ratio of Co and Se, respectively) nanosheets, and such a composite exhibited excellent OER activity with an overpotential of 324 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) in 1 M KOH. It also exhibited superior long-term stability to the benchmark IrO2 catalyst. In the home-made zinc-air battery test, the battery modified with the composite as the air cathode showed excellent performance with a small voltage gap of 0.98 V at 50 mA cm(-2), a high power density of 212.9 mW cm(-2), a high specific capacity of 570.1 mA h g(-1), and a stable cycling stability (50 h) at 10 mA cm(-2) with a round-trip efficiency of 56.3%, superior to the IrO2/C counterpart. This study can provide an avenue for developing cost effective, efficient and durable OER electrocatalysts as alternatives for various renewable energy storage and conversion devices.									6	1	0	0	0	0	6			2398-4902			WOS:000534220100005

In this paper, on the basis of density functional theory calculations, we reveal the link between the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activities and the electronic properties of pure and first-row transition-metal (TM)-doped AlN and GaN two-dimensional monolayers. We find that Ni-doped layers are singularly appealing because they lead to a low overpotential (0.4 V). Early TM dopants are not suited for the OER because they bind the intermediate species OH or 0 too strongly, which leads to very large overpotentials, or no OER activity at all. The late TM dopants Cu and Zn show less or no OER activity as they bind the intermediate species too weakly. Although in many cases the overpotential can be traced back to an OOH intermediate species being adsorbed too weakly compared to an OH species, the Ni dopant breaks this rule by stabilizing the OOH adsorbant. The stabilization can be correlated with a switch from a high-spin to a low-spin state of the dopant atom. This ability to change spin states offers an exciting ingredient for the design of OER catalysts.									7	0	0	0	1	0	7			1932-7447	1932-7455		WOS:000493865700028

The system that was investigated consists of highly doped Si substrates that were conformally coated with similar to 70 nm titania films produced by atomic-layer deposition. TiO2/electrolyte and Si/TiO2/Ni/electrolyte interfaces were then analyzed by synchrotron radiation photoelectron spectroscopy. The PES data allows for determination of the flat-band position and identification of potential regions in which Fermi level pinning, depletion, or accumulation occurred. Operando X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) techniques were additionally used to investigate the properties of heterogeneous electrocatalysts for the oxygen-evolution reaction. Operando XAS including the pre-edge, edge and EXAFS regions allowed the development of a detailed picture of the catalysts under operating conditions, and elucidated the changes in the physical and electronic structure of the catalyst that accompanied increases in the applied potential. Specifically, XAS data, combined with DFT studies, indicated that the activity of the electrocatalyst correlated with the formation of Fe dopant sites in gamma-NiOOH. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Throughout the experiments, a preferential incorporation of N into the FCNS-lattice is observed whereas the addition of phosphorus generally leads to metal-phosphate-FCNS composites. The obtained FCNSP, FCNSN, and FCNSNP facilitate the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) at 100 mAcm-2 in 1.0M KOH with overpotentials of 479, 440, and 427mV, respectively, outperforming the benchmark IrO2 (564mV) and commercial Ni metal powder (>600mV). Likewise, FCNSN and FCNSNP reveal an improved performance toward the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in 0.5M H2SO4, outperforming the pristine FCNS. All materials revealed high stability and morphological robustness during OER and HER. Notably, DFT calculation suggests that N and P doping boost the OER activity of the pristine FCNS, whereas N doping enhances the HER activity.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0				2589-0042		MEDLINE:36204269	36204269

The high-efficiency electrocatalyst with multiple functional sites is indispensable but challenging. Herein, an urchin-like Au@W18O49 electrocatalyst with dual-functional sites of Au and oxygen vacancies (OVs) is employed for the enhanced HER. The Au@W18O49 with Au/OV ratio at 0.70 exhibits an overpotential of 79 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) and a Tafel slope of 58 mV dec(-1). The optimal Au/OV ratio delicately balances the generation and transformation of H* intermediates, contributing to the superior hydrogen insertion/extraction efficiency of Au@W18O49-0.70. The increased delocalized electronic states and synergistic co-existence of Au and OVs improved the activity and durability of Au@W18O49-0.70 in the HER process.

The most preferred route to large-scale production of hydrogen is by water electrolysis from the intermittent sources (e.g., wind, solar, hydro, and tidal energy). However, the efficiency of water electrolysis is very much dependent on the activity of electrocatalysts. Thus, designing high-effective, stable, and cheap materials for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) could have a substantial impact on renewable energy technologies. Recently, single-atom catalysts (SACs) have emerged as a new frontier in catalysis science, because SACs have maximum atom-utilization efficiency and excellent catalytic reaction activity. Various synthesis methods and analytical techniques have been adopted to prepare and characterize these SACs. In this review, we discuss recent progress on SACs synthesis, characterization methods, and their catalytic applications. Particularly, we highlight their unique electrochemical characteristics toward HER. Finally, the current key challenges in SACs for HER are pointed out and some potential directions are proposed as well.									98	6	0	0	3	1	98			2311-6706	2150-5551		WOS:000510847700007	34138058

While the oxidation of water to molecular oxygen and the reduction of protons to molecular hydrogen are typically promoted by different catalysts, the Ru(II)-pincer complex recently synthesized by Kohl et al.

We adopt an explicit description of the solvent and employ metadynamics coupled with the Car-Parrinefto method to study the reaction mechanism and determine the activation free energies. Our simulations predict a novel Catalytic Cycle, which has considerably lower activation energies than earlier proposals and which does not involve the sequential aiorriaiization-dearomatization of the PNN ligand of the complex.

In this work, CoNi LDHs are used as matrix, iron sites were introduced onto the surface of the catalyst by cation replacement (Fe-CoNi LDHs). Compared with the ternary iron-cobalt-nickel LDHs prepared through the one-step method, the iron sites of Fe-CoNi LDHs mainly exist in surface layer and edges of nanosheets. Therefore, numerous reactive sites are fully exposed at surface of LDHs. The effects of surface iron sites on the coordination environment and electronic structure had been further investigated, indicating that surface doping decreases the binding energy between reactants and catalytic active sites during OER. Due to modification in the local structure and the electronic properties, the overpotential of Fe-CoNi LDHs is only 260 mV at 10 mA cm-2, showing enhanced OER performance. The electronic structure of Fe-CoNi LDHs surface is then elucidated, as well as the mechanism of enhanced electrocatalytic activity. Moreover, these results highlight the benefit of surface doping for OER performance and are expected to make a significant contribution to the development of electrocatalytic applications.									12	2	0	0	0	0	14			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000681179000001

However, the fragile nature of these oxyhydroxides or hydroxides severely reduces the long-term stability and hinders the industrial applications. Meanwhile, the poor electrical conductivity of these materials also has seriously led to the higher overpotential when applying to the OER. Herein, a novel method using polyurethane (PU) sponge as electroplating was carried out to design NiFe alloy foam with different Fe content for OER. The physical properties of NiFe alloy foams were characterized by Scanning Electronic Microscopy (SEM), Energy Dispersive System (EDS) and XRay Diffraction (XRD), respectively, suggesting that the porous NiFe alloy is formed with uniform distribution of Ni and Fe. The OER performance was tested by Cyclic Voltammetry (CV), Linear Sweep Voltammetry (LSV), Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS), I-t, etc. The results showed that the doped Fe could significantly improve the conductivity and OER performance of Ni foam. The NiFe alloy foam with 30% Fe exhibited 292 mV overpotential at 10 mA/cm~2 and the Tafel slope 126.12 mV/decade in alkaline solution with excellent long-term stability. Without any complex electrode preparation processes and binders, NiFe alloy foam is much convenient to use as anode of water splitting in alkaline media for industrial applications.

High-performance catalysts are always needed despite the sluggish kinetics of the four electron-transfer OER process. In this paper, for the first time, by employing a simple new strategy of "confined Fe overdoping", the OER activity of Ni3S2 in alkaline solution is significantly boosted, showing an overpotential of 350 mV at 10 mA cm(-2), which is even lower than that of the benchmark IrO2. The designed catalyst (Meso C-NiFeS) is composed of mesoporous highly graphited N-doped carbon and nanodomain/defect/strain-rich NiFeS nanoparticles. The mesoporous carbon support facilitates mass/electron transfer, while confined Fe overdoping leads to smaller and defect/strain-rich nanodomains. DFT calculations prove that Fe doping could induce compressing strains, which is beneficial for the OER process, modify electronic states of Ni3S2, and act as active sites at the same time. This overdoping strategy can trigger a synergic effect combining size decrease, electronic structure modification, and defect/strain engineering. Moreover, this simple strategy is easy to implant to other catalysts.									28	1	0	0	1	0	28			2574-0962			WOS:000483434700004

The catalyst of BCF(ZY)(0.1) exhibits a higher OER activity (including disk activity, intrinsic activity and mass activity) and better durability than the gold-standard OER electrocatalyst IrO2 and the well-known Ba0.5Sr0.5Co0.8Fe0.2O3-delta (BSCF) perovskite. The overpotential to deliver an electrode current density of 10 mA cm(-2) of BCF(ZY)(0.1) oxide is merely 0.32 V in 1 M KOH, and the intrinsic activity of BCF(ZY)(0.1) is similar to 52 times higher than IrO2. The outstanding electro-catalytic activity and stability of BCF(ZY)(0.1) are attributed to the increased redox ability compared with BSCF, including the faster charge transfer process and much more facile adsorption of OH- and desorption of O-2.									24	1	0	0	2	0	24			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000448147200002

Iron oxides have unique electronic properties and strongly interact with the environment, particularly through redox reactions. The iron-oxygen phase diagram therefore has been among the most thoroughly investigated, yet it still holds striking findings. Here, we report the discovery of an iron oxide with formula Fe4O5, synthesized at high pressure and temperature. The previously undescribed phase, stable from 5 to at least 30 GPa, is recoverable to ambient conditions. First-principles calculations confirm that the iron oxide here described is energetically more stable than FeO + Fe3O4 at pressure greater than 10 GPa. The calculated lattice constants, equation of states, and atomic coordinates are in excellent agreement with experimental data, confirming the synthesis of Fe4O5. Given the conditions of stability and its composition, Fe4O5 is a plausible accessory mineral of the Earth's upper mantle. The phase has strong ferrimagnetic character comparable to magnetite. The ability to synthesize the material at accessible conditions and recover it at ambient conditions, along with its physical properties, suggests a potential interest in Fe4O5 for technological applications.									99	7	0	0	14	0	101			0027-8424			WOS:000295975300018	21969537

Six polypeptides were identified by reaction with specific antisera as constituent subunit polypeptides of oxygen-evolving PS II reaction center complexes. The most abundant polypeptides were the a and beta subunits of allophycocyanin. Comparison with the polypeptide profile of isolated phycobilisomes, as well as immunoblotting with an antiserum against the large linker polypeptide, showed that the large linker polypeptide or some proteolytic fragments of it were present in the preparation. Thus, each PS II particle is, in essence, an oxygen-evolving PS II complex that is associated with the core substructure of the phycobilisome. Cross-linking experiments indicated that fragments of the large linker polypeptides are closely associated with one another and that the Chl-carrying 47-kDa polypeptide is located in close proximity to the D2 protein and the extrinsic 33-kDa protein.									7	0	0	0	5	0	7			0032-0781			WOS:A1992HR53800008

The introduction of another transition metal element, such as Co, Mn, or Ni, to replace the Fe atoms can optimize the magnetic properties, reduce magnetostriction, and enhance the thermal stability of iron nitride materials, as well as improve the electrocatalytic performance. (FexNi1-x)(4)N nanoparticles (NPs) encased within amorphous carbon were prepared via a simple route that combines a solvothermal method with non-ammonia gas nitriding. The doping of Ni not only has an important effect on the magnetism, but it also enhances the electrocatalytic performance of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The saturation magnetization (M-s) of (Fe0.95Ni0.05)(4)N NPs increased to 168.15 emu g(-1) compared with (Fe1Ni0)(4)N (142.89 emu g(-1)). Furthermore, (Fe0.90Ni0.10)(4)N exhibited the best OER activity, showing an overpotential of 292 mV to deliver a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) and a low Tafel slope (29 mV dec(-1)). These results indicate that the use of Ni-doped gamma '-Fe4N can lead to great improvements for magnetic material and electrochemical catalysis applications.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1144-0546	1369-9261		WOS:000782178900001

Improved Activity of PdO Supported over Co3O4 in the Electrocatalytic Oxygen Evolution Reaction in a Wide pH Range								ENERGY & FUELS											10.1021/acs.energyfuels.2c02522		OCT 2022			2022	Palladium(II) oxide supported over Co3O4 was studied as an electrocatalyst for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in acid, neutral, and alkaline solutions. Co3O4 has limited stability to an alkaline solution, while PdO stability goes from alkaline to slightly acidic pH. The combination of both materials was envisioned to improve the OER activity and stability in a wide range of electrolyte pH. Co3O4 and PdO@Co3O4 were synthesized by a solvothermal method using urea. PdO was deposited as small spheres on the surface of Co3O4 (8.9 wt % of Pd) and caused changes in the Co3O4 spinel structure as compared to the pure oxide, such as structural defects, change in morphology, decrease of the crystallite size, and increase of the surface area and Co3+/Co2+ ratio, and allowed the oxidation of Co4+ from Co3+. Furthermore, PdO@Co3O4 showed higher electrical conductivity, which contributed to the lower overpotential achieved at a current density of 10 mA cm-2 (eta 10) in all pH solutions. In pH 14, eta 10 for PdO@Co3O4 was 389, 46 mV lower than Co3O4. The superior OER activity after PdO@Co3O4 can be due to the lower charge-transfer resistance provided by the noble metal and by the higher electron-transfer kinetics shown by the lower Tafel slopes.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0887-0624	1520-5029		WOS:000869070400001

In this work, a universal strategy of preparing the encapsulation of Co-based multimetallic alloys/oxide nanoparticles in nitrogen-doped carbon nanotubes (named CoM@CNTs, M = Ni/Mn/Fe) was induced by annealing mixtures of the as-synthesized precursor, ethanol and different metallic acetates, including binary CoNi@CNTs, ternary CoNi/MnO@CNTs and quaternary CoNiFe/MnO@CNTs. By virtue of its unique structure with a high electrical conductive network based on CNT substrates, abundant catalytic active sites supplied by multimetallic nanoparticles and protection against nanoparticle corrosion by N-doped carbon layers, the as-synthesized CoNiFe/MnO@CNTs electrocatalyst has remarkable HER properties with a low overpotential of 122 mV and OER activity with a low overpotential of 275 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) and excellent stability and durability under long-term testing in alkaline solutions. Therefore, this strategy will provide a new route for fabricating multimetallic-based CNTs as HER/OER electrocatalysts with excellent stability and high catalytic activity.

In this work, a double perovskite oxide, i.e., NdBaMn2O5.5, is proposed as a bifunctional electrode material for water electrolysis. Layered NdBaMn2O5.5 demonstrates significant improvement in catalyzing oxygen and hydrogen evolution reactions (OER and HER, respectively), in contrast to other related materials, including disordered Nd0.5Ba0.5MnO3-delta as well as NdBaMn2O5.5-delta and NdBaMn2O5.5+delta (delta < 0.5). Importantly, NdBaMn2O5.5 has an OER intrinsic activity (similar to 24 times) and a mass activity (similar to 2.5 times) much higher than those of the benchmark RuO2 at 1.7 V versus the reversible hydrogen electrode. In addition, NdBaMn2O5.5, achieves a better overall water splitting activity at large potentials (>1.75 V) and catalytic durability in comparison to those of Pt/C-RuO2, making it a promising candidate electrode material for water electrolyzers. The substantially enhanced performance is attributed to the approximately half-filled e(g) orbit occupancy, optimized O p-band center location, and distorted structure. Interestingly, for the investigated perovskite oxides, OER and HER activity seem to be correlated; i.e., the material achieving a higher OER activity is also more active in catalyzing HER.									128	3	0	0	3	0	128			2155-5435			WOS:000419751100039

Two primary surface modifications were identified. First, water vapor, when present in the reactor either as an impurity or as an oxidation product, accelerates the volatilization of MoO3 and leads to the formation of surface voids. The presence of these voids increases the density of (100) and (h01)-type surface sites on the basal planes. Second, oxygen removal leads to the formation of crystallographic shear planes. The intersection of these defects with the (010) surface creates 2 Angstrom high steps along [001] and their presence indicates that the surface vacancy concentration has reached an upper limit. The mechanisms by which these structural changes might influence the reactivity of molybdenum oxide catalysts are discussed.

Abundant HER electrocatalysts exhibit high activity in acids, but deliver inferior performance in alkalis due to sluggish kinetics. Herein, motivated by the promoter CeO2 (rich in oxygen vacancies) that can modulate the electronic structure of materials, a high-efficiency catalyst of Co4N nanowires by coupling CeO2 vertically grown on Ni foam (Co4NCeO2/NF) is prepared by composition control and interface engineering. Anchoring CeO2 into Co4N will endow the catalyst with superhydrophilic and superaerophobic properties, and simultaneously promote water adsorption/dissociation, which dramatically boost the alkaline HER performance. The assynthesized self-supported Co4N-CeO2/NF electrode exhibits fairly low overpotentials of 52 and 149 mV at current densities of 10 and 100 mA cm(-2) for HER in 1.0 M KOH electrolyte, respectively. Furthermore, after a long-time operation of 24 h at a fixed high current density of 100 mA cm(-2), the required overpotential is increased only by 4 mV, showing the extraordinary long-time durability and promising potential in mass applications. This work will provide an effective strategy for rational design and activity enhancement of other non-precious metal-based HER electrocatalysts.									16	0	0	0	1	0	16			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000612470000030

The samples were characterized by potentiometric titration, transmission electron microscopy, nitrogen adsorption isotherms, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. A change in a carbonization temperature caused variations in surface areas, pore structures and sulfur/nitrogen contents. During pyrolysis some intrinsic sulfonic acid groups of PSC were decomposed as SO2, and some were embedded in the carbon matrix as thiophene sulfur and sulfones. N-2 atmosphere at high temperature with a reducing capability of the carbon surface resulted in an incorporation of nitrogen species to the carbon matrix. ACs had a hierarchical pore structure and the sample at 900 degrees C (AC-900) had a specific surface area of 960 m(2) g(-1) with V-micro/V-total at 0.4. The sample was tested for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in 1 M KOH, at the current density of 10 mA cm(-2). The overpotential of AC-900 was 450 mV with a Tafel slop of 163.32 mV dec(-1). The results suggested an efficient Volmer dynamics process of HER and pyridinc-N were found as contributing to the catalytic activity.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			1387-1811	1873-3093		WOS:000517854500011

Here the authors demonstrate an interfacial engineering approach where the catalyst is coated with a hydrophobic polymer to confine in situ produced O-2 and promote the 2e(-) pathway.Electrochemical two-electron water oxidation is a promising route for renewable and on-site H2O2 generation as an alternative to the anthraquinone process. However, it is currently restricted by low selectivity due to strong competition from the traditional four-electron oxygen evolution reaction, as well as large overpotential and low production rates. Here we report an interfacial engineering approach, where by coating the catalyst with hydrophobic polymers we confine in situ produced O-2 gas to tune the water oxidation reaction pathway. Using carbon catalysts as a model system, we show a significant increase of the intrinsic H2O-to-H2O2 selectivity and activity compared to that of the pristine catalyst. The maximal H2O2 Faradaic efficiency was enhanced by sixfold to 66% with an overpotential of 640 mV, under which a H2O2 production rate of 23.4 mu mol min(-1) cm(-2) (75.2 mA cm(-2) partial current) was achieved. This approach was successfully extended to nickel metal, demonstrating the wide applicability of our local gas confinement concept.									122	6	0	0	15	0	124			2520-1158			WOS:000507787600002

The thickness of the obtained U-MnO2 nanosheets was about 1-2 layers. As-prepared U-MnO2 exhibited higher turnover frequency (TOF) value of H-2 production from alkaline formaldehyde solution at room temperature as compared to that of pristine MnO2 (TOF per surface Mn atom: 2.7 vs. 1.1 h(-1)). With the ultra-thinning process, abundant surface oxygen vacancies (V-o) on U-MnO2 were demonstrated by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and extended X-ray absorption fine structure analysis, which could couple molecular O-2 and benefit for the breaking of C-H bonds from formaldehyde with the generation of (OOH)-O-center dot radical. Detailed reaction-pathway calculations showed that the O-2 assisted dehydrogenation of alkaline HCHO solution were thermodynamically favored on U-MnO2 with lower energy barrier of 0.32 eV as compared to that of 1.25 eV on pristine MnO2. This work not only provides an applicable method for synthesizing ultrathin MnO2 nanosheets but also gives an evidence towards more essential understanding of hydrogen evolution reaction from alkaline formaldehyde solution at atomic level.									36	2	0	0	7	0	37			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000463126200047

Nano-micro letters				11	1			2	2		10.1007/s40820-018-0232-2				2019 Jan 09	2019	The development of efficient earth-abundant electrocatalysts for oxygen reduction, oxygen evolution, and hydrogen evolution reactions (ORR, OER, and HER) is important for future energy conversion and energy storage devices, for which both rechargeable Zn-air batteries and water splitting have raised great expectations. Herein, we report a single-phase bimetallic nickel cobalt sulfide ((Ni,Co)S2) as an efficient electrocatalyst for both OER and ORR. Owing to the synergistic combination of Ni and Co, the (Ni,Co)S2 exhibits superior electrocatalytic performance for ORR, OER, and HER in an alkaline electrolyte, and the first principle calculation results indicate that the reaction of an adsorbed O atom with a H2O molecule to form a *OOH is the potential limiting step in the OER. Importantly, it could be utilized as an advanced air electrode material in Zn-air batteries, which shows an enhanced charge-discharge performance (charging voltage of 1.71V and discharge voltage of 1.26V at 2mAcm-2), large specific capacity (842mAhgZn-1 at 5mAcm-2), and excellent cycling stability (480h). Interestingly, the (Ni,Co)S2-based Zn-air battery can efficiently power an electrochemical water-splitting unit with (Ni,Co)S2 serving as both the electrodes. This reveals that the prepared (Ni,Co)S2 has promising applications in future energy conversion and energy storage devices.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0				2150-5551		MEDLINE:34137954	34137954

Developing highly active, low cost and lasting electrocatalysts has become a top priority. Herein, we have successfully synthesized iron and nickel co-doped cobalt hydroxide (Co-Ni-Fe-511) nanosheets for the OER. This catalyst exhibits outstanding performance with an overpotential of 288 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2), a high polarization current of about 67 mA cm(-2) at 330 mV overpotential, a low Tafel slope of 43 mV dec(-1), and small degradation after 8 hours of long-term OER operation. In addition, we simulate alkaline water electrolysis at a current density of 200 mA cm(-2) at 70 degrees C in 6 M KOH electrolyte, and the energy consumption of Co-Ni-Fe-511 is 45.7 kW h kg(H2)(-1). For comparison, commercial RuO2 consumed 46.8 kW h kg(H2)(-1). This suggests that Co-Ni-Fe-511 is more appropriate than commercial RuO2 for water electrolysis in commercial water electrolysis. The high activity, low Tafel slope, good stability and low energy consumption will pave the way for the use of Co-Ni-Fe-511 in practical applications.									27	2	0	0	0	0	28			2046-2069			WOS:000375445500064

Although the KrF laser had a number of excitation lines of O2 and NO, it was confirmed that the KrF laser could excite OH without interference of LIF signal from another molecule. The time evolution of OH density in the post-discharge region showed oxygen had the effect of increasing OH and shortened the O-H lifetime. That indicates O(1D) radical as well as electron reacted with H2O to yield OH radicals and that OH reacted with products made by oxygen such as O or O3. The oxidation reaction of NO with OH was experimentally demonstrated. It was found that NO accelerated OH decay rate. The OH density was calibrated by calculating absolute density of OH.

In this paper, we examine critically the use of chemical descriptors as a method for conducting catalytic screens. Applying density functional theory calculations to a two-center metal oxide model system, we show that the Sabatier analysis is quite successful for predicting activities and capturing the chemical periodic trends expected for the first-row transition metal series, independent of the proposed mechanism. We then extend this analysis to heterodimer metallic systems-metal oxide catalysts with two different catalytically active metal centers-and find signs that the Sabatier analysis may not hold for these more complex systems. By performing a principal component analysis on the computed redox potentials, we show. (1) that a single chemical descriptor inadequately describes heterodimer overpotentials and (2) mixed metal overpotentials cannot be predicted using only pure-metal redox potentials. We believe that the analysis presented in this article shows a need to move beyond the simple chemical descriptor picture when studying more complex mixed metal oxide OER catalysts.									10	0	0	0	1	0	10			1932-7447	1932-7455		WOS:000406726200020

Hydrogen from biomass depolarized water electrolysis								Proceedings of the 16th Intersociety Energy Conversion Engineering Conference. `Technologies for the Transition'								472	5 vol.1						1981	1981	Biomass-derived materials are shown to be viable candidates for lowering the cell voltage of water electrolysis by substituting the direct electromechanical oxidation of biomass-derived materials for the anode oxygen evolution reaction. The authors discuss cyclic voltammetry data on the electrochemical oxidation of glucose in aqueous sulfuric acid. Using a scan rate of 5 mV/s, cyclic voltammograms for 12 weight percent sulfuric acid with and without 0.51 molal glucose are performed over the potential range of -700 to +800 mV versus a mercury/mercury sulfate reference (+670 mV versus reversible hydrogen) at 26degC. Platinized platinum is used for the working electrode. In the presence of glucose significant oxidation peaks are observed at +50 and +510 mV versus the reference. The anodic peak at +50 mV appears particularly attractive for lowering water electrolyzer cell voltages. Peak current densities at +50 mV are 15 mA/cm2 at ambient and 140 mA/cm2 at 92degC. The successful development of this approach in water electrolyzers could provide hydrogen at costs significantly below those available with existing electrolyte technologies.					16th Intersociety Energy Conversion Engineering Conference. `Technologies for the Transition'16th Intersociety Energy Conversion Engineering Conference. `Technologies for the Transition'	9-14 Aug. 19819-14 Aug. 1981		Atlanta, GA, USAAtlanta, GA, USA	0	0	0		0	0	0						INSPEC:1813212

Herein, on the basis of the Kirkendall effect, we developed a simple synthesis of yolk-shell nanostructured nickel-cobalt diselenides (NiCoSe2) with nanosized wide annular aisles via one-step electrodeposition. Expressly, the electronic coupling between Ni and Co cations was well regulated via the optimization of Ni/Co atomic ratios to regulate eg filling of Ni for optimized OER. The elaborate yolk-shell nanostructured NiCoSe2 catalyst exhibits remarkable OER performance, delivering a low overpotential of 249 mV at a geometric current density of 10 mA cm(-2) in alkaline media, a small Tafel slope of 43 mV dec(-1) and a decent durability with a tiny decay of 23 mV over 20 h electrolysis. The Kirkendall effect induced formation route of the yolk-shell nanostructure will provide helpful guidance for the rational design of hollow structured catalyst in the field of energy catalysis and other extended applications.

In this work, a controllable electrochemical transformation of ZIF-67 into active porous metal oxides is employed for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). ZIF-67 is directly coated onto the surface of three-dimensional (3D) printed titanium (Ti) electrodes using a step-by-stepin situgrowth and then converted into cobalt oxide (Co3O4) by electrochemical cycling, designated as ZIF-67/Ti-E electrode. Raman spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and cyclic voltammetry (CV) have been used to verify the electrochemical transformation from octahedral ZIF-67 to thin sheet-shaped Co3O4. This large-surface-area Co3O4, as well as the existence of Co(IV)species right before water oxidation, plays a critical role in enhanced OER performance under alkaline electrolysis conditions. The optimized ZIF-67/Ti-E electrode has demonstrated a better OER performance with a low overpotential of 360 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2)and excellent durability, compared with its counterparts produced by the widely popular calcination method. Our method provides a simplein situ, fast, mild, and energy-efficient approach to employ MOF-derived materials as promising OER catalysts using scaled-up 3D-printed electrodes.									5	1	0	0	0	0	5			2398-4902			WOS:000544657200050

Here, the surface of porous BiVO4 Ni-doped CoOx via nitrogen flow assisted electrostatic spray photoanodes was modified by the deposition of undoped and pyrolysis. This newly developed atmospheric pressure deposition technique allows for surface coverage throughout the porous structure with thickness and composition control. PEC testing of modified BiVO4 photoanodes shows that after deposition of an undoped CoOx surface layer, the onset potential shifts negatively by ca. 420 mV and the photocurrent density reaches 2.01 mA cm(-2) at 1.23 vs V-RHE under AM 1.5G illumination. Modification with Ni-doped CoOx produces even more effective OER catalysis and yields a photocurrent density of 2.62 mA cm(-2) at 1.23 V-RHE under AM 1.5G illumination. The valence band X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and synchrotron-based X-ray absorption spectroscopy results show the Ni doping reduces the Fermi level of the CoOx layer; the increased surface band bending produced by this effect is partially responsible for the superior PEC performance.									43	2	0	0	1	0	43			1932-7447			WOS:000386107600016

In this work, the role played by the functional in predicting the activity of single atom catalysts (SAC) in the hydrogen and oxygen evolution reactions (HER and OER) is studied. 16 transition metal (TM) atoms embedded in N-doped graphene are simulated and the performance of the widely adopted Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof (PBE) functional against the hybrid PBE0 functional is assessed. The PBE+U approach, a computationally less complex way to correct for the self-interaction error in density functional theory, is also considered. The predictions obtained with PBE have a substantial deviation from PBE0 for first row TMs, i.e., 3d systems, while smaller deviations are found for the 4d and 5d series. The PBE+U results represent an improvement with respect to PBE, although some differences from PBE0 remain. This study underlines the importance of the choice of the DFT functional in screening new catalysts and in predicting catalytic activities. The use of PBE appears acceptable for 4d and 5d metals, while in the case of 3d systems PBE+U or PBE0 approaches are recommended, in particular for magnetic ground states.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0				2513-0390		WOS:000849514300001

The stability and the activity of the Ni-based catalysts are crucial parameters that gained a lot of interest recently. This paper addresses the effect of the preparation temperature (T-p) on the electrocatalytic activity of nickel oxide nanostructures modified glassy carbon (nano-NiOx/GC) electrode towards the OER. Increasing T-p, beyond room temperature (r.t.), results in enhancing the kinetics of the OER demonstrated in the values of the exchange current density (i(o)) and the onset potentials of the OER. The effect of Tp is reflected on the morphology and size of NiOx, that is increasing T-p results in decreasing their particle size. Elevated T-p enhances the OER as a result of increasing the population of the electroactive NiOx phases as indicated from their respective XRD patterns. Rapid degradation of the catalytic activity of nano-NiOx/GC electrode towards the OER is observed upon prolonged electrolysis at r.t. Cycling the potential several times between 0.85 and 1.65 V vs. RHE restores the activity to various extents depending on the measurement temperature (T-m). (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

Online time- and potential resolved electrochemical dissolution profiles revealed novel corrosion features (signals) in the potential window from 0 to similar to 1.4 V, where known severe dissolution due to the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) takes place. Most of the features follow the thermodynamic changes of the Ru oxidation/reduction state, which consequently trigger so-called transient dissolution. An as synthesized Ru sample was found to exhibit an order of magnitude higher dissolution rate than an electrochemically oxidized amorphous Ru sample. The latter, in turn, dissolved about 10 times faster than rutile RuO2. The observed OER activity was in an inverse relationship with the measured dissolution. Disagreement was found with the general assumption that the onset of the OER should coincide with the onset of go dissolution. Interestingly, in all samples, Ru dissolution was observed at about 0.17 V lower potentials than the OER. The present results are relevant for various energy-conversion and -storage devices such as proton exchange membrane electrolyzers, low temperature fuel cells, reverse fuel cells, supercapacitors, batteries, and photocatalysts that can contain Ru as an active component.									111	3	0	0	4	0	112			1932-7447			WOS:000354339000051

However, further enhancement of the catalytic activity for OER is quite challenging, particularly for the development of stable SACs with overpotentials <180 mV. Here, we report an iridium single atom on Ni2P catalyst (Ir-SA-Ni2P) with a record low overpotential of 149 mV at a current density of 10 mA.cm(-2) in 1.0 M KOH. The Ir-SA-Ni2P catalyst delivers a current density up to similar to 28-fold higher than that of the widely used IrO2 at 1.53 V vs RHE. Both the experimental results and computational simulations indicate that Ir single atoms preferentially occupy Ni sites on the top surface. The reconstructed Ir-O-P/Ni-O-P bonding environment plays a vital role for optimal adsorption and desorption of the OER intermediate species, which leads to marked enhancement of the OER activity. Additionally, the dynamic "top-down" evolution of the specific structure of the Ni@Ir particles is responsible for the robust single-atom structure and, thus, the stability property. This Ir-SA-Ni2P catalyst offers novel prospects for simplifying decoration strategies and further enhancing OER performance.									44	1	0	0	4	0	44			0002-7863	1520-5126		WOS:000704514200018	34465098

ANCo(3), a typical class of antiperovskite nitrides, in which both the A site and N content can be effectively modulated, is considered a promising class of catalysts for overall water splitting. Here, we report the overall water splitting results of Co-based antiperovskite nitrides for the first time. CuNCo3 nanosheets and CoN0.73Co3 nanowires on nickel foam (NF) are designed as OER and HER catalysts, respectively. The alkaline electrolyzer of CuNCo3/NF||CoN0.73Co3/NF for overall water splitting exhibits a low cell voltage of 1.53 V at 10 mA cm(-2) with high cycling stability. The results explore the applications of antiperovskite nitrides for overall water splitting and provide strategic guidance for the design of efficient catalyst materials.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000821596500001

However, the active sites in N-doped carbon remain under debate owing to the complication in N types and the challenge in controllable synthesis. Here, via an innovative approach of template-assisted pyrolysis of phthalocyanine, we achieve a controlled preparation of N types in N-doped carbon foams. Electrochemical experiments show that the catalyst dominated by graphitic N rather than other N types drives highly selective CO2R to CO against the hydrogen evolution reaction, which achieves a CO Faradaic efficiency of 95% at 0.5 V versus RHE and runs stably for 80 h. Theoretical calculations indicate that carbon atoms next to graphitic N are triggered for the CO production, while carbon atoms next to pyridinic N promote the hydrogen evolution and pyrrolic N disfavors both reactions.									37	2	0	0	1	0	38				2666-3864		WOS:000658750600012

Given the fundamental mechanism of the interfacial interaction between Pt and oxophilic components, engineering a moderate oxygen-friendly surface environment of Pt-based catalysts is beneficial for endowing Pt with high catalytic activity for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Herein, we fabricated ultralong jagged Pt85Mo15-S nanowires with rich interfacial active sites by using S as the "active auxiliary" to demonstrate an enhanced catalytic HER performance. Strikingly, the Pt85Mo15-S nanowires exhibited exceptional activity with 3.62 times the specific current density and 4.03 times the mass current density of commercial Pt/C as well as excellent stability towards alkaline HER. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy revealed that the S element could prevent the further oxidization of Mo and then lead to enough electron transfer from Mo to Pt. In addition, the theoretical calculations demonstrated that the water dissociation energy barrier could be significantly reduced under the interfacial synergy of the intimate contact between Pt and MoSx. This work illustrates a new strategy to advance the fundamental exploration on electrocatalytic materials, which makes a systematic approach to build an interfacial model catalyst for fundamental electrocatalytic studies of alkaline HER.									29	4	0	0	0	0	30			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000494830400021

Compared with OMCs with long channel length, due to more entrances for catalytic target accessibility and a short pathway for rapid diffusion, the utilization efficiency of cobalt nanoparticles inside the plate-like OMCs with short pore length is well improved, which can take full advantage of porous structure in electrocatalysis and increase the utilization of catalysts. The active sites in N/Co/OMCs for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) are highly exposed to oxygen molecule, which results in a high activity for ORR. By combination of the catalytic properties of nitrogen dopant, incorporation of Co nanoparticles, and structural properties of OMCs, the N/Co/plate-like OMCs are highly active noble-metal free catalysts for ORR in alkaline solution.

Arrhenius plots of the kinetic data were used to estimate the reaction of half-lifes at 50 degreesC. This survey showed that hydrocarbons and organic substances containing a single oxygenated group were kinetically the most stable; whereas organic substances containing two oxygenated groups in which one group was an alpha- or beta-positioned carbonyl group were the most reactive. Compounds with an alpha- or beta-positioned carbonyl group ( aldehyde or ketone) had rates of reaction that were up to 10(24)-times faster than rates of similar molecules lacking the carbonyl group. This survey of organic reactivity, together with estimates of the molecular containment properties of lipid vesicles and liquid spherules, indicates that an origins process in a small domain that used C, H, O-intermediates had to be catalytic and use the most reactive organic molecules to prevent escape of its reaction intermediates.									19	0	0	0	10	0	19			0169-6149			WOS:000224130300004	15573498

In this study, nickel and iron co-incorporated tungsten oxides (NixFe1-xWO4) were synthesized using a simple polyol method, and the materials achieved a highly efficient and stable oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in an alkaline electrolyte. The product as-synthesized using the polyol method consisted of an undeveloped wolframite structure, which was converted to its complete crystal by heat treatment at 600 degrees C, with an increase in crystallite size. The OER properties of NixFe1-xWO4 could be controlled by the ratio of Ni and Fe present and heat treatment temperature. A ternary tungsten oxide (Ni0.5Fe0.5WO4) with a Ni:Fe:W molar ratio of 0.5:0.5:1 deposited on a glassy carbon electrode required 297 mV to reach a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) in 1.0 M KOH solution. The 10 mA cm(-2) electrolysis with the electrode was continued for at least 100 h. This was quite different from a similarly-synthesized NiFe oxide without W, which required an additional 47-mV overpotential to reach 10 mA cm(-2) and had inferior durability.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0013-4651	1945-7111		WOS:000828340900001

Herein, a heterostructure photoanode by integrating BP nanoflakes and hematite was fabricated, in which the functional phosphate by the partially oxidation of BP could tightly bridge hematite and BP and improve the interfacial charge transfer. The well-matched band structures of BP and hematite, as well as the highly-efficient oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity of BP can significantly facilitate the charge separation and transfer for enhanced water oxidation performance. As a result, the as-prepared heterostructure exhibits a high photocurrent density of 3.02 mA cm(-2) at 1.23 V vs. RHE, much better than that of the sample without BP modification. Furthermore, a remarkable photocurrent density of 3.81 mA cm(-2) at 1.23 V vs. RHE with good photostability can be achieved after the loading of FeNiOOH cocatalyst. This study clearly shows the excellent application of BP for solar water splitting.									2	0	0	0	1	0	2			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000707126000208

The overpotential of the NiCo-LDHs@B2O3/carbon paper (NiCo-LDHs@B2O3/CP) electrode is only 213 mV at the current density of 10 mA cm(-2) in 1 M KOH, which is 123 mV less than that of NiCo-LDHs/CP and slightly better than noble metal catalyst RuO2/CP (230 mV). What's more, at 50 mA cm(-2) in 1.0 M KOH, the overpotential of NiCo-LDHsgB(2)O(3)/CP is still kept at a low value of 320 mV much better than that of NiCo-LDHs/CP (441 mV) and RuO2/CP (373 mV). Importantly, it showed long-term electrochemical stability. The introduction of amorphous boron oxide layers can be promoted to form a borate interface, and it can effectively enhance reactivity of active species. The boron oxide shell on the surface of LDHs can protect active species stability to enhance cycling stability. This work may inspire the development of low-cost and efficient OER electrocatalysts for energy conversion with NiCo-LDHs@B2O3/CP.									32	1	0	0	1	0	32			2168-0485			WOS:000449577200072

Here, we demonstrate excellent performance of NiCo nanoparticles anchored on porous fibrous carbon aerogels (NiCo/PFC aerogels) as bifunctional catalysts toward the Zn-air battery. This material is designed and synthesized by a novel K2Ni(CN)4/K3Co(CN)6-chitosan hydrogel-derived method. The outstanding performance of NiCo/PFC aerogels is confirmed as a superior air-cathode catalyst for a rechargeable Zn-air battery. At a discharge-charge current density of 10 mA cm-2, the NiCo/PFC aerogels enable a Zn-air battery to cycle steadily up to 300 cycles for 600 h with only a small increase in the round-trip overpotential, notably outperforming the more costly Pt/C+IrO2 mixture catalysts (60 cycles for 120 h). With the simplicity of the synthetic method and the outstanding electrocatalytic performance, the NiCo/PFC aerogels are promising electrocatalysts for Zn-air batteries.									189	8	0	0	6	0	191			1530-6984	1530-6992		WOS:000385469800077	27599048

Due to its lower Ir packing density and higher OER activity vs the Benchmark catalyst (440 vs 12 A g(Ir) (-1) at 1.43 ViR-free), the P2X catalyst shows an improved PEM (proton exchange membrane) water electrolyzer performance at approximate to 9 times reduced Ir loading, however, only if a platinum-coated porous transport layer (PTL) at the anode is used. While the performance of membrane electrode assemblies (MEAs) with the Benchmark catalyst is unaffected when using an untreated titanium PTL, MEAs with the P2X catalyst perform poorly, which can be attributed to a contact resistance at the anode/PTL interface due to the low electrical conductivity of the P2X catalyst (0.7 S cm(-1)) vs the Benchmark catalyst (416 S cm(-1)) and the passivation of the Ti-PTL. A heat treatment procedure is used to transform the amorphous IrO(OH)(x) of the P2X catalyst into crystalline IrOx and, hence, increases its electrical conductivity. The optimum temperature for heat treatment to maximize electrical conductivity, OER activity and MEA performance will be evaluated.									11	0	0	0	0	0	11			0013-4651	1945-7111		WOS:000690781600001

Herein, SrCo0.8Fe0.2O3-delta (SCF-0) material is simply heated in a H3BO3 solution to form a synthetic catalyst, exhibiting excellent OER activity. The optimized SCF (SCF-0.2) has an overpotential of 287 mV and a Tafel slope of 50 mV dec(-1) at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) (the two items of SCF-0 are 396 mV and 102 mV dec(-1)). Subsequent material characterization confirmed that, due to the efficient improvement of the surface morphology of the material, the smooth plane generates numerous needle-like nanoflower structures with a size of 30-50 nm, which significantly enhanced the specific surface area of the material, attributed to selective slowly dissolve out of a lot of Sr and a small amount of Fe. In addition to that, the perovskite SCF-0.2 + Pt/C is used as the air cathode in the self-assembled zinc-air battery, which shows excellent peak energy density similar to 106 mW cm(-2) and charge-discharge cycle life. In particular, this simple surface modification method provides an effective optimization strategy for improving the specific surface area and OER performance of the material.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000639714600002

Herein, we present the utilization of local lattice distortion of TiO2 support to regulate the local coordination environment and electronic structures of atomically dispersed Pt catalysts, resulting in the enhanced performance toward HER. Spectral analysis uncovers an elongated Pt-O bond length, lower Pt-O co-ordination numbers, as well as less electron holes residing in Pt 5d orbitals for Pt species on distorted TiO2. Density functional theory (DFT) calculation reveal that the variation might weaken the hydrogen adsorption on Pt sites and cause the optimized Delta G value of H*. As a result, the atomically dispersed Pt catalyst displays superior HER mass activity (62.34 A mg(-1) Pt) and the highest turnover frequency (TOF) (56.1 H-2.s(-1)) at the 50 mV overpotential in an acid media that are 18.7 and 5.56 times higher than commercial Pt/C. The work should create a new avenue in manipulating the local coordination environment of catalysts via the lattice distortion of the support, and in pursuing desired catalytic performance.

Substitution of Co3O4 spinel structure improves the intrinsic catalytic activity. Enhanced OER activity stems from the presence of nonstoichiometry and low coordination metal sites, which lower the OH-adsorption energy and improve the conductivity of the catalysts. OER activity is tuned by varying Ni to Co ratio and the best activity is observed for NiCo-1, having Ni/Co = 1. This is refl ected in a lower overpotential (eta) of 320 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) and a lowest Tafel slope of 53 mV dec(-1). The turnover frequency value ( 1.37 x 10(-2) s(-1)) and lower apparent activation energy ( 35.5 +/- 3 kJ mol(-1)) at eta = 350 mV further support the superior intrinsic activity of NiCo-1. The synergetic effect of porosity, nonstoichiometry, and rich redox centers results in enhancement of the OER activity of NixCo3-xO4-y 3D nanocage. Present work provides a simple strategy to design a low-cost and effi cient electrocatalyst which can be combined with photoelectrode to realize superior solar to hydrogen conversion devices.									89	2	0	0	7	0	89			2196-7350			WOS:000393771300019

The nanowires are used as an electrocatalyst for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in an alkaline aqueous solution. Through contrasting with several compositions of the alloy, we observe the best electrochemical performance from a specific metal oxide grown on CuAgZn with a mass ratio of 47% : 28% : 25%, which displays an overpotential of 0.448 +/- 0.02 V at 20 mA cm(-2) and 0.475 +/- 0.01 V at 30 mA cm(-2), as well as a Tafel slope of 118 +/- 4 mV dec(-1). Copper-silver oxide nanoparticles, copper oxide nanoparticles, and silver oxide nanoparticles (CuO-Ag2O NPs, CuO NPs and Ag2O NPs) are also prepared to compare with CuO-Ag2O NWs. The results indicate the as-prepared CuO-Ag2O NWs show an improved activity for the OER. Furthermore, the prepared CuO-Ag2O NWs show good stability, where the normalized current density can remain at over 80% after the electrolysis of 10 000 s. This strategy for the fabrication of CuO-Ag2O NWs is a promising and facile way to develop more multi-metal oxide catalysts for energy conversion.									9	2	0	0	1	0	11			2046-2069			WOS:000351494800063

Computation has made important contributions uncovering and elucidating these correlations. The calculations have predominantly been of the spin-restricted type. Using both the restricted and unrestricted formalism, we have performed a DFT-PBE study of the key OER intermediates on 10 nonmagnetic metal oxide surfaces. We show that, depending on the binding energy, unrestricted DFT calculations may yield considerably higher binding energies than restricted DFT calculations. At low binding energies, spin quenching of the adsorbates is inefficient, leading to a strong open shell character that is not well described by restricted DFT. At high binding energies, spin quenching is complete, so that the unrestricted DFT binding energy equals the restricted DFT binding energy. We conclude therefore that although strong binding systems can be properly described by restricted DFT, unrestricted DFT is a necessity for weak binding systems, to which photocatalysts typically belong. The use of unrestricted DFT has little effect on the shape of volcano plots when Delta G(O) - Delta G(OH) is chosen as a descriptor. The location of the data points on the plot does show a considerable shift for weak binding substrates.									83	2	0	0	1	0	83			1932-7447			WOS:000332188100027

This study reports the structure, magnetic properties and electrocatalytic activity to oxygen evolution reaction (OER) of NiFe NiFe2O4 composite nanofibers prepared by solution blow spinning (SBS) with an average diameter of 133.4 nm. X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis revealed that NiFe alloy crystallites have an average size of 26.3 nm. The magnetization versus temperature (MxT) and magnetization versus magnetic field (MxH) measurements show saturation magnetization of 123 emu g(-1) and thermal blocking temperature of 117 K. The MxT measurements show a quick response of the composite sample to magnetic field variations of +/- 0.3 Oe, indicating that the solution blow spun material has great potential for magnetic sensor applications. From an electrocatalytic point of view, nanofibers show a low overpotential of 316 mV vs RHE at J = 10 mA cm(-2), and a significant turnover frequency (TOF) of 4.03 s-1 at only 400 mV. NiFeNiFe2O4 nanofibers have an excellent chemical stability as revealed by chronopotentiometry analysis along 15 h. These results stand solution blow spun NiFe-NiFe2O4 composite nanofibers in line with the best NiFe-based catalysts reported in the literature.									18	1	0	0	0	0	19			0022-3697	1879-2553		WOS:000518725400016

With lower cost, it is a potential alternative to precious metal oxides like IrO2 and RuO2 in water electrolysis. However, room still remains for improving its activity according to recent understandings of OER on perovskite oxides. In this work, Fe substitution has been introduced in LaCoO3 to boost its OER performance. Density function theory (DFT) calculation verified that the enhanced performance originates from the enhanced Co 3d-O 2p covalency with 10 at% Fe substitution in LaCoO3. Both DFT calculations and Superconducting Quantum Design (SQUID) magnetometer (MPMS-XL) showed a Co3+ spin state transition from generally low spin state (LS: t(2g)(6) e(g)(0), S = 0) to a higher spin state with the effect of 10 at% Fe substitution. X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) supports DFT calculations on an insulator to half-metal transition with 10 at% Fe substitution, induced by spin state transition. The half-metallic LaCo0.9Fe0.1O3 possesses increased overlap between Co 3d and O 2p states, which results in enhanced covalency and promoted OER performance. This finding enlightens a new way of tuning the metaloxygen covalency in oxide catalysts for OER.									168	11	0	0	6	0	170			0897-4756	1520-5002		WOS:000418990700029

We demonstrate that inducing a lattice strain in IrO2 crystal structure due to interface lattice mismatch enables an enhancement of the OER catalytic activity. The lattice strain is obtained by the direct growth of IrO2 nanoparticles on a specially exposed surface of alpha-MnO2 nanorods via a simple two-step hydrothermal synthesis. Interestingly, the prepared hydride OER activity increases with a lower IrO2 grown mass, which offers an opportunity to reduce the usage of precious iridium and ultimately obtains a specific mass activity of 3.7 times than that of IrO2 prepared under the same conditions and exhibits equivalent stability. The lattice mismatch in the underlying interface induces the formation of lattice strain in IrO2 rather than the charge transfer between the materials. The lattice strain changes are in good agreement with the order of the OER activity. Our experimental results indicate that using the special exposed surface substrates or tuning the supporting morphology structure can manipulate the catalyst materials lattice strain for the design of more efficient OER catalysts.									51	1	0	0	2	0	51			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000417669300023	29148711

Herein, we report a facile and template-free synthetic route to realize unusual asymmetrical yolk-shell (AYs) structures composed of mixed-valence NiCo2O4 material. Explicitly, this work highlights the unusual off-central core, an AYs structure that encompasses a hemispherical hollow interior, and a mesoporous solid counterpart. As such, it retains desirable hollow structural characteristics while favorably precludes the excessive unexploited hollow interior space for increased active material packing. Unlike the conventional symmetrical yolk-shell (SYs) which is composed of a porous shell framework radially throughout the structure, the mesoporous solid constitution of the AYs structure offers an inbuilt reinforced framework to support the partial porous shell and concurrently leaves sufficient void for volumetric buffering. Another unique structural feature of the AYs structure is the formation of a submicron aperture or opening on the shell that enhances accessibility of electrolyte diffusion. All of these synergistic structural features of NiCo2O4 AYs structures enhance the pseudocapacitive and electrocatalytic properties.									17	1	0	0	0	0	17			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000389624600031	27934149

Herein, Co3O4, Co9S8 catalysts and their heterostructure Co3O4/Co9S8 were synthesized and evaluated as water oxidation electrocatalysts. The characterization of Co3O4, Co9S8, and Co3O4/Co9S8 electrocatalysts was performed using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, scanning electron micro-scopy and X-ray diffraction techniques. The heterostructure Co3O4/Co9S8 (1.46 V) exhibited water oxidation electrocatalysis at extremely low onset potential compared to Co3O4 (1.58 V), and Co9S8 (1.48 V) catalysts.

In our study, nanostructured NiCo2S4/Ni3S2/NF nanoarrays are rational developed in experiments via a simple hydrothermal reaction. Ascribed to the 3D nanostructured NiCo2S4/Ni3S2 with numerous exposure active sites and large contact areas for the electrolyte, the binder-free feature of NiCo2S4/Ni3S2/NF facilitates a low charge transfer resistance, as well as the synergetic effect of NiCo2S4 and Ni3S2. The obtained electrocatalyst showed ultrahigh electrocatalytic activity with an overpotential of 111 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) and a Tafel slope of 57 mV dec(-1). In addition, the electrode showed an area specific capacity of 6.13 F cm(-2) at 10 mA cm(-2) and superior rate capability (2.72 F cm(-2) at 80 mA cm(-2)), accompanied by excellent cycling stability. This results presented in our work can provide an effective strategy for rational design of other hybrid materials with excellent electrochemical performance in the application of electrocatalysis and supercapacitors.

Herein, the cobalt phosphide decorated nitrogen and sulfur co-doped three dimensional graphene (CoP@N,S-3D-GN) electrocatalyst was synthesized via a simple two step production pathway including hydrothermal self-assembly and low-temperature phosphidation. Compared both with CoP-anchored 3D-GN (CoP@3D-GN) and N,S-co-doped 3D-GN (N,S-3D-GN) samples, profiting from the synergistic merits of co-doping and metal phosphide, CoP@N,S-3D-GN delivers boosted electrocatalytic activity towards HER with an overpotential of only 118 mV at 10 mA.cm(-2), a Tafel slope of 50 mV.dec(-1) and an exchange current density of 2.2 x 10(-2) mA.cm(-2). Furthermore, it preserves its electrocatalytic activity for both after 1000 cyclic voltammetry cycles at 100 mV.s(-1) potential scan rate and at least 50 h under 120 mV overpotential. This work provides rational route for engineering of metal phosphides anchored 3D-graphene hybrid electrocatalysts to boost the HER catalytic performance. (C) 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

The evolution characteristics of different chemical bonds in the process of coal oxidation were studied. The surface active group changes of two different coal samples under different gas conditions were obtained, and the oxidative spontaneous combustion characteristics of silicified coal were microscopically proved. The results show that the oxygen absorption of silicified coal is higher than that of nonsilicified coal. During the reaction of silicified coal with oxygen, with the increase of coal temperature, the amount of oxidation gas and pyrolysis gas, oxygen consumption rate and exothermic intensity are higher than those of nonsilicified coal; the changes of related functional groups were mainly manifested in the hydroxyl groups at the peak positions of 3697-3625 cm(-1) and 3624-3610 cm(-1), the methyl and methylene groups at the peaks of 2975-2915 cm(-1) and 2870-2845 cm(-1), the aromatic ring C = C double bond at the position of 1604-1599 cm(-1), the aromatics and the oxygen-containing functional groups at the spectral segment of 3060-3032 cm(-1). Thus, the transformation rules of the related microstructure of silicified and nonsilicified coal under two gas atmospheres were obtained. This study has key significance for revealing the characteristics of silicified coal oxidation at lower temperature.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0010-2202	1563-521X		WOS:000740073800001

In this work, we demonstrate that OER activity of an electrodeposited Ni catalyst can be influenced by a support material, and electron transfer between the Ni-based catalyst and the support is proposed to increase the oxidation states of Ni and thus contribute to enhancing its intrinsic OER activity. When a Ni catalyst layer is deposited using a carbon-based powder support instead of an expensive Au foil, the overpotential decreased by more than 50 mV at 10 mA/cm(2) due to the synergic effect of the increased surface area and the modified Ni electronic states. In addition, compared with carbon powder supports, Fe and N doped carbon (Fe-N-C) is found to provide particularly more efficient support for the Ni OER catalyst; however, according to electrochemical measurement results, there is no indication of additional Fe intercalation. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis shows the highest binding energy of Ni particularly on the Fe-N-C, suggesting facile electron transfer from Ni to the Fe-N-C interface.

Nevertheless, it remains challenging to develop the efficient while cost-effective catalyst for the catalytic pyrolysis of tire. In this study, the pyrolysis of tire scrap at 500 degrees C with the biochar produced from the gasification of poplar wood at 850 degrees C were conducted. The biochar catalyst significantly affected the evolution of the volatiles and the char properties, while had a slight impact on the yields of the gas, tar and char products. The biochar catalyst catalyzes the cracking of limonene, a major liquid product in tar, to form significantly more propane in gases and alkanes or alkenes in the tar. In addition, the interaction between the biochar with the oxygen-containing organics promoted the re-condensation reaction, which increased the oxygen content in the char, but the biochar catalyst did not influence the evolution of the aromatics. Additionally, the catalytic pyrolysis also makes the biochar catalyst more oxygen-deficient and more resistant towards oxidation. Concluding all the results showed that biochar, which were produced from the gasification of poplar wood can be a potential catalyst for the pyrolysis of tire. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

First, we show that a new peroxide-like adsorption geometry is the most stable configuration for LiO2, which is distinct from the previously known O-Li-O triangular geometry. The proposed most stable adsorption configuration is because the Zr atoms in the substrate play a critical role in stabilizing the LiO2 cluster. Second, our ab initio calculations indicate that both the ORR and OER catalytic activities are most likely to adopt the four-electron mechanism with a considerably low overpotential of only 0.44 and 0.76 V, respectively. Finally, we show that the adsorption energy of Li2O2 is a good descriptor for both ORR and OER catalytic activities, and weak Li2O2 adsorption behavior is positively related to low overpotentials and satisfactory catalytic performance.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000787373300042	35271770

Therefore, rational design of highly efficient multifunction electrocatalysts with optimized nanostructures is of great importance for sustainable energy conversion processes. Herein, hollow petal-like Co3O4 nanoflakes could be readily available through calcining the corresponding MOFs(Metal-organic frameworks) nanoflower precursor, which could be controllable synthesized by a novel template-free protocol. Through modulating reaction conditions, the morphology and porosity of the catalysts could be controlled, which could directly influence on the catalytic activities of OER and HER. The super-hydrophilic hollow petal-like Co3O4 nanoflakes effectively facilitate mass transfer and ease gas bubbling, which contribute to a promoted bifunctional electrocatalytic activity for both HER and OER, as well as overall water splitting (A stable 10 mA cm(-1) water-splitting current can be reached by just applying 1.67 V, which is comparable to other recently reported catalysts in alkaline media). The hollow Co3O4 microflowers that reported here confirm the significance of structural features effect on electrocatalyst performance, which will open up a new approach to design high-performance electrode materials for gas evolution reactions.

Therefore the kinetic parameters, estimated from traditional methods, cannot be applied due to the significance of oxygen diffusivity. Moreover, this process involves multiple chemical reaction systems, which are interconnected and often too complex to explain via analytical frameworks. One common solution to comprehend such a process and optimise its parameters is mathematical deterministic models. In the present study, a comprehensive deterministic model was developed to predict the kinetic parameters with a finite number of experiments by an optimisation algorithm. Then the model was used to study the progress of the process, particularly in the first steps of the process to explain the decrement of C?O bonds in the oxidised fibre by adding a reduction step to the stabilisation mechanism and considering the role of oxygen as a catalyst in cyclisation. The developed model is based on the structure of the PAN precursor, fibre tow and governing differential equations for the underlying phenomena, including chemical kinetics and mass transfer, associated with empirical relations for oxygen diffusivity and physical properties under isothermal conditions. The results presented up to 95% improvement in outcomes of the model for a pilot carbon fibre production line.									9	0	0	0	0	0	9			2058-9883			WOS:000451658400013

Using ab initio molecular dynamics, we investigated this interface focusing on Pt single atoms supported on anatase TiO2(101) in a water environment. Based on recent experiments showing a broad distribution of Pt coordination sites in TiO2, we examined six distinct single-Pt supported species with different nominal Pt oxidation states, namely: Pt, PtOH, and PtO2 species adsorbed on the stoichiometric surface; Pt adsorbed at a surface oxygen vacancy (O-v); and Pt substituting a surface Ti cation (Pt-Ti), both without and with an accompanying O-v (Pt-Ti + O-v). As found for the pristine anatase surface, interfacial water remained intact in the presence of a nearly neutral Pt adatom within the time duration of our simulations (similar to 15 ps). Similarly, no (or only temporary) water dissociation was observed at the Pt-Ti + O-v and PtO2 interfaces, due to the formation of very stable planar Pt coordination structures that interact only weakly with water. In contrast, water dissociated with OH- (H+) on the Pt atom when this substituted a surface Ti (oxygen) ion as well as on PtOH. The significant proton affinity of Pt atoms at surface oxygen vacancies suggests that negatively charged Pt species are particularly efficient at catalyzing hydrogen evolution in aqueous TiO2.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			1463-9076	1463-9084		WOS:000537251100004	31674604

We have prepared porous carbon spheres-doped Ni, Co - alloys by using a hydrothermal method with melamine and pectin as precursors and with the addition of nickel nitrate and cobalt nitrate. The corresponding materials exhibit good electrochemical performance and excellent electrocatalytic activity for HER. The overpotential (OP) of the as-prepared materials can achieve 240 mV keeping a Tafel slope (TS) of 55 mV dec(-1) at 10 mA cm(-2) in an acid (0.5 M H2SO4) solution. The corresponding samples maintain stability after 24 h and 5000 cycles in the chronovoltage and cyclic voltammetry methods, respectively. When the as-prepared materials are oxidized by 30% H2O2 for 12 h, the corresponding as-prepared oxidation samples exhibit excellent electrochemical performance in a supercapacitor application. The specific capacitance (SC) of the as-obtained materials reaches 312 F g(-1) at 1 A g(-1) with decent rate capability and cyclic stability.

In this work, we report the fabrication of RuP and Ru2P nanoparticles supported on ordered macroporous N-doped carbon hollow spheres (RuP/H-NC and Ru2P/H-NC) through a facile and scalable space-confined pyrolysis process. The RuP/H-NC catalyst exhibits Pt-like activity in alkaline electrolyte, by means of the macroporous structure with a larger specific area and more exposed active sites, as well as the synergistic effect between the RuP nanoparticles and N-doped carbon. Specifically, the RuP/H-NC catalyst yields superior hydrogen evolution reaction activity in terms of low overpotential of 19 mV in 1 M KOH to achieve a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) and excellent durability, outperforming Ru2P/H-NC and most of the reported non-Pt catalysts. Further density function theory calculation reveals that RuP is more intrinsically active with favorable hydrogen adsorption Gibbs free energy than that of Ru2P.									7	0	0	0	1	0	7			0957-4484	1361-6528		WOS:000532367100001	32203950

Herein, we report the fabrication of higher-dimensional thin film CuO nanostructures with controlled morphologies i.e., nanosheets, nanocubes, nanoflowers, and nanoleaves and their relative performance for water oxidation catalysis. Among these nanostructures, CuO nanoflowers exhibit high catalytic activity with an onset potential of 1.48 V and a Tafel slope of 84 mVdec(-1) in 1 M KOH solution. Moreover, an overpotential of 270 mV and 400 mV is needed to attain a current density of 10 mAcm(-2) and 100 mAcm(-2) respectively with high Faradaic efficiency. More promisingly, the catalytic performance was found highly dependent upon the nanoscale features and subsequently the improved electrochemically active surface area (ECSA). Such morphology dependent OER performance and binder-free nature of catalyst may provide the high-speed track for electrons transport owing to the inherent catalyst-substrate electronic interconnection and thus making it more promising and high-performance electrocatalyst for OER.

It has direct impact on the evolution and final state of massive stars and also influences the elemental abundances resulting from nucleosynthesis in such stars. Providing a reliable estimate for the energy dependence of this reaction at stellar helium burning temperatures has been a longstanding and important goal. In this work, we study the role of potential new measurements of the O-16(e, e' alpha)C-12 reaction in reducing the overall uncertainty. A multilevel R-matrix analysis is used to make extrapolations of the astrophysical S factor for the C-12(alpha, gamma)O-16 reaction to the stellar energy of 300 keV. The statistical precision of the S-factor extrapolation is determined by performing multiple fits to existing E1 and E2 ground state capture data, including the impact of possible future measurements of the O-16(e, e' alpha)C-12 reaction. In particular, we consider a proposed MIT experiment that would make use of a high-intensity low-energy electron beam that impinges on a windowless oxygen gas target as a means to determine the total E1 and E2 cross sections for this reaction.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			2469-9985	2469-9993		WOS:000500720900003

To achieve artificial photosynthesis, efficient water oxidation catalysts (WOCs) are essential. In nature, the manganese-oxo-calcium cluster (Mn4CaO5) in the oxygen-evolving center (OEC) of photosystem II catalyzes water oxidation. Inspired by this process, abundant and inexpensive manganese oxides have been recognized for their high potential as effective and reliable materials for water oxidation reaction. However, in contrast to RuO2 and IrO2, manganese oxide catalysts still exhibit less water oxidation efficiency. Herein, we report a simple method for synthesizing high surface area, porous MnO2 with different crystal structures from the CaMnO3 precursor by treating with dilute HNO3 solution followed by heating at different temperatures. These porous MnO2 nanomaterials have a surface area in the range of 106-272 m(2) g(-1). These nanomaterials exhibit remarkable photochemical water oxidation activity with a maximum turnover frequency (TOF) of 3.29 x 10(-3) s(-1). Our findings suggest a simple way to design and synthesize low-cost, high surface area, porous MnO2 nanostructures for efficient water oxidation.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			2398-4902			WOS:000738825000001

The texture, morphology, specific surface area, crystallinity, and electrocatalytic activity of the WCoO-NP were strongly associated with the W and Co content. The WCoO-NP materials contains 15 mol% of tungsten showed enhanced electrocatalytic behaviour, substantial shift in the OER onset potential of 190 mV, Tafel slope (92 mV/dec), ultra-low charge-transfer resistance, and current density of 30 mA cm(-2 )at 1.55 V-RHE, which is more efficient catalyst than bare cobalt oxide nanoparticles (Co-3 O-4-NP) counterpart and comparable to benchmark transition metal oxide electrocatalysts. The WCoO-NP materials exhibits long-term durability and good bifunctional electrocatalytic behaviour for both the OER and ORR, having Delta E (=E-OER - E-ORR) of only 0.92 V which could be credited to the synergistic effect, enriched specific surface area, and improved electrical conductivity upon tungsten-doping. The WCoO-NP electrocatalysts prepared from earth-abundant materials are a promising candidate for high-efficiency OER and ORR applications.									11	1	0	0	1	0	11			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000523184600041		
J	Wu, Weijian; Gao, Zhen; Li, Qun; Wang, Zhiya; Liu, Shiyin; Wu, Hongbo; Zhao, Yuanchun; Jiao, Yalong; Zhao, Xiaojia								Structural transformation of metal-organic framework with constructed tetravalent nickel sites for efficient water oxidation								JOURNAL OF ENERGY CHEMISTRY				74				404	411		10.1016/j.jechem.2022.07.040				NOV 2022	2022	A mixture of Ni and Fe oxides is among the most commonly active catalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) during the water oxidation process. In particular, Ni oxide incorporated with even a small amount of Fe leads to substantively enhanced OER activity. However, the critical role of Fe species during the electrocatalytic process is still under evaluation. Herein, we report nickel (oxy)hydroxide incorpo-rated with Fe through the surface reconstruction of a bimetallic metal-organic framework (NiFe-MOF) during the water oxidation process. The spectroscopic investigations with theoretical calculations reveal the critical role of Fe in promoting the formation of highly oxidized Ni4+, which directly correlates with an enhanced OER activity. Both the geometric and electronic structures of the as-reconstructed Ni1_xFexOOH electrocatalysts can be delicately tuned by the Ni-Fe ratio of the bimetallic NiFe-MOF, further affecting the catalytic activity. As a result, the Ni1_xFexOOH derived from Ni0.9Fe0.1-MOF delivers low overpoten-tials of 260 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) and 400 mV at 300 mA cm(-2).

Herein, the Co/Ni metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) derived metal phosphides/carbon matrix composites are successfully produced by the precipitation-carbonization-phosphorization processes. The obtained samples are characterized and analyzed for structural and morphological investigation. Electrochemical tests for OER are performed in the alkaline medium. The positive effects of P, Ni doping in MOFs on the structure and properties of composites have been analyzed. Benefitting from the unique structure of three-dimensional flower-like polyhedron with rich structure and higher porosity, the NiCo-P/NC catalyst exhibits the lowest overpotential of 0.32 V compared with the commercial IrO2 (0.34 V) at 10 mA/cm(2), as well as outstanding stability and kinetic mechanism. Besides, the cost of the proposed novel material is calculated to be 4.337 US$/g, which is only 1.57% of that of commercial IrO2 (276 US$/g). The results obtained from the MOF-derived low-cost and high-efficiency OER catalyst would provide a new perspective on application of electrochemical storage and batteries.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2381-6872	2381-6910		WOS:000731587800015

Nano-micro letters				11	1			2	2		10.1007/s40820-018-0232-2				2019	2019	The development of efficient earth-abundant electrocatalysts for oxygen reduction, oxygen evolution, and hydrogen evolution reactions (ORR, OER, and HER) is important for future energy conversion and energy storage devices, for which both rechargeable Zn-air batteries and water splitting have raised great expectations. Herein, we report a single-phase bimetallic nickel cobalt sulfide ((Ni,Co)S2) as an efficient electrocatalyst for both OER and ORR. Owing to the synergistic combination of Ni and Co, the (Ni,Co)S2 exhibits superior electrocatalytic performance for ORR, OER, and HER in an alkaline electrolyte, and the first principle calculation results indicate that the reaction of an adsorbed O atom with a H2O molecule to form a *OOH is the potential limiting step in the OER. Importantly, it could be utilized as an advanced air electrode material in Zn-air batteries, which shows an enhanced charge-discharge performance (charging voltage of 1.71V and discharge voltage of 1.26V at 2mAcm-2), large specific capacity (842mAhgZn -1 at 5mAcm-2), and excellent cycling stability (480h). Interestingly, the (Ni,Co)S2-based Zn-air battery can efficiently power an electrochemical water-splitting unit with (Ni,Co)S2 serving as both the electrodes. This reveals that the prepared (Ni,Co)S2 has promising applications in future energy conversion and energy storage devices.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0				2150-5551		MEDLINE:30687731	30687731

Using a straightforward and scalable sol-gel synthesis, we explore the effects of metal composition in CoxTi1-xOy on electrochemical activity, atomic structure, and electronic state. Physical and electronic characterization reveal that increased amounts of Ti stabilize the 2+ oxidation state of the Co precursor and lead to formation of less active CoO-like catalysts. Conversely, films with Co:Ti ratios of 1:1 or greater result in catalysts with high activity, correlating with greater Co 3+ character, as measured by ex situ XAS for samples as-prepared and after exposure to OER conditions. Additionally, decreasing the Ti content systematically shifts the Co redox potential from approximately 1.5 V vs. RHE with a 1:3 Co:Ti ratio to 1.0 V vs. RHE with no Ti, further evidence that Ti stabilizes Co in a lower oxidation state. Controlling the oxidation state of metals in metal-oxide OER catalysts can have a profound effect on catalytic activity.

Plants have a complex redox system, involving enzymatic and non-enzymatic compounds. The evolutionary origin of enzymatic antioxidant defense in plants is yet unclear. Here, we describe the redox gene network for A. thaliana and investigate the evolutionary origin of this network. We gathered from public repositories 246 A. thaliana genes directly involved with ROS metabolism and proposed an A. thaliana redox gene network. Using orthology information of 238 Eukaryotes from STRINGdb, we inferred the evolutionary root of each gene to reconstruct the evolutionary history of A. thaliana antioxidant gene network. We found two interconnected clusters: one formed by SOD-related, Thiol-redox, peroxidases, and other oxido-reductase; and the other formed entirely by class III peroxidases. Each cluster emerged in different periods of evolution: the cluster formed by SOD-related, Thiol-redox, peroxidases, and other oxido-reductase emerged before opisthokonta-plant divergence; the cluster composed by class III peroxidases emerged after opisthokonta-plant divergence and therefore contained the most recent network components. According to our results, class III peroxidases are in expansion throughout plant evolution, with new orthologs emerging in each evaluated plant clade divergence.									13	1	0	0	11	0	14			2045-2322			WOS:000493439600039	31673065

Herein, Co-NC@CNTs with a 3D interconnected conductive carbon network were synthesized. Co-NC nanoparticles derived from ZIF-67 as carbon network nodes have micro/mesoporous structures, as well as rich Co species catalytic sites for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER). And CNTs as carbon skeletons transfer electrons to enhance the conductivity. Additionally, the interconnected carbon network provides abundant space for accommodating the discharge products and prevents the reduction of catalytically active sites. Therefore, Co-NC@CNTs as a cathode catalyst for Li-O-2 batteries show a high initial discharge capacity of 12572.2 mA h g(-1) at 200 mA g(-1), good rate capability (5865 mA h g(-1)@1000 mA g(-1)), and excellent cycling stability (145 cycles at 250 mA g(-1)) superior to that of Co-NC and pure CNT cathodes. This study provides effective approaches to design and fabricate promising cathodes to improve the performance of Li-O-2 batteries.									7	0	0	0	1	0	7			2398-4902			WOS:000593581500017

Boosting hydrogen evolution activity of transition meta-nitrogen embedded graphene through introducing secondary transition metal								SURFACES AND INTERFACES				29						101714	10.1016/j.surfin.2021.101714				APR 2022	2022	Exploring highly efficient catalysts for the electrochemical hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) is highly demanded in the sustainable production of hydrogen. Herein, we report a feasible strategy to create the atomic-scale dual sites in functional graphene via introducing the secondary TM dopant into the TMN4 pre-embedded graphene, termed as TMaN(4)/TMb for simplification. According to the free energy analysis, we identify two homogenous combinations of MnaN4/Mn-b and FeaN4/Fe-b wherein the free energies of hydrogen adsorption are 0.08 and 0.04 eV for MnaN4/Mn-b meanwhile 0.00 and -0.01 eV for FeaN4/Fe-b, respectively, indicating the significant improvement in comparison with the separated components. Furthermore, the reaction barriers of H2O splitting are 1.62 and 1.08 for MnaN4/Mn-b and FeaN4/Fe-b, revealing the relative better proton supply of the latter under alkaline electrolyte. Furthermore, the binding energies are -6.00 and -5.71 eV for MnaN4/Mn-b meanwhile -6.63 and -5.70 eV for FeaN4/Fe-b, respectively, which substantially exceed the corresponding cohesive energies and thereby avoid the atom clustering. Therefore, the interatomic bonding of dual active sites as a chemical facilitator paves a novel route for the design of efficient catalysts at the atomic scale.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2468-0230			WOS:000764892000002

As a nonprecious-metal catalyst for the HER, molybdenum nitride (MoN) has excellent corrosion resistance and high electrical conductivity, but its catalytic activity is still inadequate. Here we report our findings in dramatically enhancing the HER activity of MoN by creating porous MoN@nitrogen-doped carbon (MoN-NC) nano-octahedrons derived from metal-organic frameworks (MOFs). The composite catalyst displays remarkably high catalytic activity, demonstrating a low overpotential of 62 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) (eta(10)), a small Tafel slope of 54 mV dec(-1), and a large exchange current density of 0.778 mA cm(-2) while maintaining good stability. The enhancement in catalytic properties is attributed to the unique nanostructure of the MoN, the high porosity of the electrode, and the synergistic effect between the MoN and the nitrogen doped carbon substrate. The performances are among the best ever reported for nonprecious-metal-based electrocatalysts (comparable to those of a 20% Pt/C commercial catalyst), making the porous MoN-NC nano-octahedrons some of the most active and acid-stable electrocatalysts for the HER									240	12	0	0	7	0	243			2155-5435			WOS:000401054300054

To provide fundamental insight, we present here a density functional theory study of the structural change of Pt-3d transition metal (TM, including Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni and Cu) alloys with (1 1 1) orientation under the reductive and oxidizing conditions as well as its effect on the CO oxidation. We find that under the reductive conditions (vacuum and CO), 3d TM prefers to occupy in the subsurface layer due to its higher surface energy and smaller atomic size. While under the oxidizing conditions, the strong O-3d TMs interaction would induce 3d TM segregation to the surface, migrating further in the surface layer to form oxidized 3d TM islands. We find that Pt (1 1 1) with the atomic dispersed 3d TM in surface layers is highly active for CO oxidation via bi-functional mechanism. The interplay between structure and reaction environment as well as effect on the catalytic activity is highlighted. (c) 2010 Elsevier B. V.

The former produces hydrogen as a clean fuel and the latter decreases the amount of CO2 emissions and thus reduces greenhouse effects. Here, we prepare two types of copper molybdate, CuMoO4 and Cu3Mo2O9, and electrochemically investigate them for water splitting and CO2 reduction. Our findings show that Cu3Mo2O9 is a better electrocatalyst for full water splitting compared to CuMoO4. It provides overpotentials, which are smaller than the overpotentials of CuMoO4 by around 0.14 V at a current density of 1 mA cm(-2) and 0.10 V at -0.4 mA cm(-2), for water oxidation and hydrogen evolution reactions, respectively. However, CuMoO4 adsorbs CO2 and the reduced intermediates/products more strongly than Cu3Mo2O9. Such different behaviors of these electrocatalysts can be attributed to their different unit cells.									11	0	1	0	0	0	12				2046-2069		WOS:000582937000032	35518391

Therefore, the design and synthesis of highly efficient bifunctional electrocatalysts for anodic hydrazine oxidation reaction (HzOR) and cathodic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) are crucial and highly desired. In this work, we report a facile synthesis strategy to prepare hollow CoSe2/MoSe2 nanospheres with abundant active interfaces for hydrazine-assisted hydrogen production. The homogeneous mixing of Co and Mo ions in the metal organic framework precursors ensures the formation of intimately contacted interfaces after selenization, leading to the "reinforced concrete" CoSe2/ MoSe2 composites. Benefiting from the CoSe2/MoSe2 interfaces, the hollow CoSe2/MoSe2 nanosphere performs a low HER overpotential of 168 mV with an excellent stability over 12 h. Additionally, it also exhibits a low overpotential of 386 mV (vs. RHE) for HzOR and an ultralow cell voltage (1 mA cm(-2)) of 160 mV, which are among the best reported performance of powdered electrocatalysts. The present work develops a promising bifunctional electrocatalyst with active interfaces for energy-saving electrolytic hydrogen production.									21	0	0	0	2	0	21			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000600981900004

The first (highest frequency) semicircle is due to the charge-transfer resistance for chloride discharge and the simultaneous chlorine adsorption coupled to the double-layer capacitance. The second semicircle (around 5 Hz) is due to the adsorption and desorption of a chlorine intermediate. The third (lowest frequency, around 0.5 Hz) semicircle is due to the relaxation of surface oxygen species. The impedance data allow the steps of the overall reaction to be examined individually. On a Pt surface the rate of chloride discharge and simultaneous chlorine adsorption (the admittance of the first semicircle) is first order with respect to chloride concentration and has a potential-dependence close to 58 mV/decade. The rate of the adsorption and desorption process (the admittance of the second semicircle) is second order with respect to chloride concentration, and has a potential dependence close to 3O mV/decade. The time constant for the adsorption/desorption processes is ca 20 ms, independent of electrode potential in the range studied. These features are consistent with a mechanism in which a faster discharge reaction (Cl- half arrow right over half arrow left Cl(ad) + e) is followed by a slower surface combination reaction (2Cl(ad) --> Cl2), but inconsistent with mechanisms in which ion + atom desorption is predominant, the initial chloride discharge is slow, or a unipositively charged chlorine species is involved.									18	0	0	0	1	0	18			0013-4686			WOS:A1992JU27100006

Here we report a novel class of Ir porous nanohollows (p-NHs) with tunable wall thickness, which electrocatalyze acidic OER with much enhanced performance relative to conventional Ir nanoparticles. The p-NH structure is deliberately-tailored via a facile hydrothermal approach, in which the initially-formed solid Ir spheres were in situ etched via the Kirkendall effect. At an overpotential of 300 mV, the Ir p-NH catalyst delivers a mass activity of 1.75 A mg(Ir)(-1), which is 6.25 and 3.20 times higher than those of commercial Ir/C and control Ir solid nanosphere catalysts, respectively. Ir p-NHs as an anode enable voltages of 1.50 V and 1.59 V at 10 and 100 mA cm(-2), respectively, for acidic water splitting. We explore how porosity energetically promotes OER activity of Ir-based catalysts using density functional theory (DFT) calculations, which reveal that the adsorption of *OOH and thus OER activity can be described by the generalized coordination number of surface Ir sites. Our findings offer new insights into the rational design of highly-open Ir-based nanostructures for efficient OER electrocatalysis.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000827634500001

Theory, Substantiation, and Properties of Novel Reversible Electrocatalysts for Oxygen Electrode Reactions								JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY C				119	21			11267	11285		10.1021/jp510234f				MAY 28 2015	2015	Hypo-d(f)-oxides of transition elements (d = 5) usually feature decisive and highly pronounced effects of spontaneous adsorptive dissociation of water molecules, as the main and initial thermodynamic precondition state for the reversible latent storage and spillover properties of primary oxides (Pt-OH, Au-OH), otherwise indispensable ingredients in electrocatalysis for the oxygen electrode reactions. The higher the altervalent number (or capacity) of the former, and when mostly further advanced for the proper mixed valence hypo-d(f)-oxide supports, the higher the overall (electro)catalytic yields primarily for cathodic oxygen reduction (ORR) and its anodic evolution (OER). In fact, cyclic voltammetry revealed the interrelated redox properties of the primary (Pt-OH) and surface (Pt=O) oxides between the cathodic hydrogen and anodic oxygen evolving limits, though the former has already been for longer known as the intermediate state from hydrogen oxidation in heterogeneous Doeberriner reaction upon Pt catalyst, and as being water molecules self-catalyzed (Ertel). Such interfering interrelated and autocatalytic species substantially define electrocatalytic properties of plain (Pt) or noninteractive supported noble metals (Pt/C), along the potential axis, and within some range even make them highly polarizable. Meanwhile, the latter can be continuously and successfully electrocatalytically depolarized and maintained reactivated. Such spontaneously renewable activation and maintenance of the reversible electrocatalytic state for the oxygen electrode reactions all along such cyclic voltammograms is the main Sir William Grove target challenge of the present study. In such a respect, continuously and spontaneously renewable adsorptive water molecule dissociation effectively means and enables the latent storage and electrocatalytic spillover properties of the primary oxide(s) for the reversible oxygen electrode (ROE) behavior, and these have been identified and substantiated, back and forth, all along the potential axis between hydrogen and oxygen evolving limits. Such advanced electrocatalytic properties imply selective grafting of interactive (SMSI, strong metalsupport interaction) nanostructured hyper-d-Pt (Au, RuPt) clusters upon individual and/or preferably composite mixed valence hypo-d-(f)-oxide supports. The latter then feature the extra high stability, pronounced electronic conductivity, and many other d-electronic-based metal properties mostly arising and being established upon the hypo-hyper-d-d-(f)-interelectronic bonding effect, along with and based upon spontaneous dissociative water molecule adsorption upon exposed oxide support surfaces, thereby yielding renewable primary oxide latent storage by simple continuous water vapor supply and imposed characteristic membrane type hydroxide ion surface migration. Migrating hydroxide, as individual species, under imposed polarization transfers its prevailing part of electron to the metallic electrocatalyst, hence resulting as the Pt-OH (Au-OH) dipole, and by the surface repulsion obeys reversible spillover distribution and imposes the electrocatalytic ROE properties all over the catalyst surface and DL pseudocapacitance charging and discharging, as well.The strong adsorptive surface oxide (Pt-O -> 1) deposition out of the primary oxide (Pt-OH -> 0) irreversible disproportionation thereby imposes unusually high reaction polarization of Pt, Au, Pd, and all other noble and transition d-metals within a very broad (600 mV, and even broader) potential range and, thereby, in general, mostly pronounced polarizable noncatalytic properties for oxygen electrode (ORR, OER) reactions. Thus, the strong interactive and selective hypohyper-dd-interelectronic grafting bonding of nanostructured individual (Pt) or prevailing hyper-d-intermetallic phase (MoPt3; HfPd3) cluster catalysts on altervalent and mixed-valence hypo-d(f)-oxide supports, as substantially and typically based upon the metallic d-d- or d-f-interelectronic bonding strengths and SMSI features, provide and keep just inferred basically all (inter)metallic properties of composite electrocatalysts, the primary oxide latent storage, and enhanced spillover and thereby enable approaching their reversible (electro)catalytic properties and optimization for the ROE. The reversibly revertible alterpolar bronze behaves (Pt/HxNbO5 <-> Pt/Nb(OH)(5), x approximate to 0.3) as the thermodynamic equilibrium alterpolar state, and thereby substantially advanced electrocatalytic properties of these composite interactive electrocatalysts for both oxygen (ORR, OER) and hydrogen (HOR, HER) electrode reactions, consequently, have been inferred as spontaneously altering and strong spillover features, in particular unique and superior for the revertible (PEMFC versus WE (water electrolysis)) cells.									11	1	0	0	1	0	11			1932-7447			WOS:000355495600001

In general, noble-metal-based nanomaterials (including Pt, Rh, Ru, Ir, etc.) have drawn tremendous research attention in the context of the HER because of their nearly optimal bindings to hydrogen, robust stability and tunable physical/chemical properties. Particularly, carbon as a substrate not only offers a stabilizing and conductive matrix, but also impacts the electronic structure of the supported metal by interfacial interaction, necessitating a detailed understanding. To speed up the sluggish kinetics of the HER, the design and construction of efficient electrocatalysts is of crucial importance. Herein, a comprehensive review of the recent advances in carbon-supported noble-metal electrocatalysts is presented, focusing on their synthetic strategies, structural analyses, and applications in HER electrocatalysis. Specifically, the correlation between the electronic structure and activity is discussed. Furthermore, a perspective is offered highlighting the challenges and opportunities for development of highly efficient HER electrocatalysts, with the aim for widespread utilization of practical water electrolyzers toward green hydrogen production.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			1614-6832	1614-6840		WOS:000804993200001

Their particular characteristics make them especially useful when dealing with catalytic water oxidation at anodes. The in situ characterization of the fate of electrocatalysts (whether molecular or oxide materials) employed under reaction conditions is crucial to determine the chemical identity and the physical state of the actual catalytic species. Such studies also help in both, attaining mechanistic insights underlying the catalytic reaction and confirming/discarding the possibility of molecular to colloidal or heterogeneous phase conversions taking place prior or under turnover conditions. This perspective article highlights the use of in situ Raman and SERS as principal spectroscopic tools in the electrocatalysis field by means of recent contributions where they are employed to in operando characterize both molecular and oxide-based water oxidation electrocatalysts. These in situ spectroscopic measurements support in assessing both the progressive oxidation and the structural evolution of the employed catalytic species under electrochemical conditions.

Here, a novel precious-metal-free cathode catalyst, Co3O4 nanoparticle-incorporated mesoporous Beta zeolite, was first synthesized by using a facile steam-assisted crystallization (SAC) and hydrothermal approach. Owning to the synergetic catalytic effects between the Co3O4 nanoparticles and the mesoporous Beta matrix, the resulting Co3O4/m-Beta nanocomposites catalyst showed comparable ORR electrochemical catalytic activity to the benchmark 20 wt% Pt/C catalyst with a high onset potential of 0.88 V, and much higher methanol tolerance with a negligible negative shift of the peak potential and excellent electrochemical stability in alkaline media. The relatively higher surface Co2+ concentration and the abundant Bronsted acid sites facilitate the ORR process, mainly through a 4e(-) pathway, which makes the Co3O4/m-Beta nanocomposite a favorable candidate for improving energy storage and conversion efficiencies in fuel cells.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			2196-0216			WOS:000407694400004

Herein, the tuned fabrication of ultrathin and tortuous nickel/cobalt-layered double hydroxide (NiCo-LDH) nanosheets via a graphene oxide (GO) surface-confined strategy is reported, yielding nanosheets with a thickness of 1.7-1.8 nm that is duplicated from the graphene oxides in terms of both the lateral size and the shape. It has been found that the C/O functional groups on the GO surface have functioned to promote the oxidation of Co2+ to Co3+, and to transform the beta-phase NiCo-hydroxide (NiCo-OH) into the LDH-phase with tuned homogenous composition and geometry. The ultrathin NiCo-LDH nanosheets mimic the morphology and size of the graphene due to the surface-confined and/or surface-guided growth. The as-obtained NiCo-LDH-graphene (NiCo-LDH-G) nanosheets exhibit a superior electrocatalytic activity for oxygen evolution reaction, evidenced by a small overpotential of 0.337 V (@10 mA cm(-2) in 0.1 m KOH electrolyte), and a high charge storage capability of 1489 F g(-1) as electrodes for supercapacitors. This 2D surface-confined growth strategy may pave a way for the fabrication of ultrathin 2D materials including but not limited to transition metal hydroxides for high-performance electrochemical applications.									163	9	0	0	7	0	162			1616-301X	1616-3028		WOS:000450367700005

A unique wedge-like morphology was observed in Fe-1-Co-1-MOF. The optimized Fe-1-Co-1-MOF (1:1 of molar ratio of iron to cobalt) exhibits superior catalytic activity to oxygen evolution reaction (OER) performance with a lowest overpotential of only 233 mV at a current density of 10 mA.cm(-2) and the higher current density of 400 mA.cm(-2) can be provided at overpotential of 264 mV. The Tafel slope in alkaline aqueous solutions was 24.4 mV.dec(-1). After 10 h of continuous operation, the catalyst showed only a slight loss of current density at 50 mA.cm(-2). This success may be attributed to synergy between the bi-metallic organic framework catalyst and the large pores of conductive nickel foam, as well as the synergistic effect between the two phases molecules of the bi-metallic organic framework metal.

Currently, nickel sulfides are considered as promising candidates for EWS due to their low cost and high catalytic activity. However, the facile design of nickel sulfides with high catalytic performance is still highly demanded. In this study, we have developed a onestep solvothermal strategy to construct nickel sulfides as efficient water splitting catalysts. By taking advantage of the small size, abundant active sites, large electrochemical surface area, and good conductivity, the nanoworm-like nickel sulfides (NiS-NW/Ni foam [NF]) exhibit better oxygen evolution reaction performance (a low overpotential of 279 mV to achieve 100 mA cm(-2), Tafel slope of 38.44 mV dce(-1)) than the nanoplate-like analogs, as well as most of reported nickel sulfide-based electrocatalysts. In addition, the NiS-NW/NF directly used as bifunctional electrodes for overall water splitting requires a low voltage of 1.563 V to attain a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) with good long-term durability.

A novel heterogeneous Co3O4/Co(OH)(2) hybrid is synthesized through a simple facile one-pot hydrothermal reaction. The as-obtained hierarchical Co3O4/Co(OH)(2) hybrids can serve as highly efficient electrocatalytic water oxidation catalysts for alkaline electrolytes. The prepared hierarchical Co3O4/Co(OH)(2) hybrids show strong interaction effects, facilitating the increase of the number of active sites and facile charge transfer ability. Remarkably, hierarchical Co3O4/Co(OH)(2) hybrids afforded electrocatalytic water oxidation activity, it requires a low potential of 1.60 V to obtain a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) and a small Tafel slope of approximately 103 mV dec(-1). A preliminary electrocatalytic water oxidation reaction mechanism catalyzed by a cobalt-based catalyst is proposed according to the reported publications and experimental data. The final step for oxygen evolution is the rate-determining step, which is supported by electrochemical experiments. This study indicates that the hierarchical Co3O4/Co(OH)(2) hybrids are promising as efficient electrocatalysts for water oxidation that can be used in water splitting for hydrogen production and generation of hydrocarbon fuels and fuel cells.									14	1	0	0	0	0	15			1144-0546	1369-9261		WOS:000428033700028

By using ultrathin Ni nanosheets with thicknesses of around 4 nm and different temperatures of thermal treatment, tunable oxidation of the metallic nanosheets was achieved. This was proven to have a great impact on the catalysts' electrical conductivity and activity. The NiO/Ni two-dimensional (2D) nano-metal catalyst prepared at 250 degrees C possesses a potential of 1.59 V (vs. RHE) at the current density of 100 mA cm(-2) in 1 M KOH solution, and still exhibits a high performance after 15 000 cycles. Furthermore, the enhanced electrical conductivity and exposure of active sites contribute to a kinetically low-cost process, resulting in a Tafel slope of 51 mV dec(-1). The repeated folding and calendering method is a mature industrial manufacturing procedure, and therefore this creative repeated size reduction and thermal oxidation production process for oxide/metal nanosheets has the potential to be extended to various kinds of metal materials that could be used to produce electrocatalysts in high yields.									9	0	0	0	1	0	9				2046-2069		WOS:000399005500044

Recently, piezocatalysis that can conquer the above shortcomings emerges as a promising catalytic technique and arouses considerable interests. With rare application of piezocatalysis on H2O2 generation, exploiting efficient tactics for improving piezocatalytic H2O2 productivity is highly anticipated. Herein, atomic-level thickness Bi4Ti3O12 nanosheets with rich surface oxygen vacancies (OVs) are prepared for two-step single-electron O-2 reduction into H2O2 . Piezoelectric force microscopy, piezo-electrochemical tests, and Finite Element Simulation disclose that both the atomic-level thickness and OVs enlarge the piezoelectric coefficient, rendering stronger piezoelectric polarization for accelerating the charge separation and reaction kinetics. Density functional theory calculations uncover that the surface OVs also decrease the adsorption energy of O-2 molecules for facilitating their activation. The ultra-thin Bi4Ti3O12 with optimal OVs content shows a piezocatalytic H2O2 evolution rate of 1611.2 mu mol.h(-1).g(-1) with benign durability.

Herein, we report a bifunctional electrode fabricated by in situ growth of Mn-doped CoSe2 nanonetworks on carbon fiber cloth (Mn-CoSe2/CFC), which shows attractive electrocatalytic properties toward glycerol oxidation reaction (GOR) in alkali and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in acid. A flow alkali/acid hybrid electrolytic cell (fA/A-hEC) was then developed by coupling anodic GOR with cathodic HER with the Mn-CoSe2/CFC bifunctional electrode. Such fA/A-hEC enables a rather low voltage of 0.54 V to achieve 10 mA cm(-2), and maintain long-term electrolysis stability over 300-h operation at 100 mA cm(-2) with Faraday efficiencies of over 99% for H-2 and 90% for formate production.

In this study, vanadium-doped Ni3S2 nanorod arrays grown on three-dimensional nickel foam (V-Ni3S2/NF)were designed and synthesized by a facile hydrothermal route. Electrochemical measurements showed that the sample with an appropriate amount of V doping (S: V mass ratio of 25:3) exhibited superior OER performance, with an overpotential of 189 mV at a current density of 100 mA cm(-2) and a low Tafel slope of 148.87 mV dec(-1). The improved catalytic performance can be attributed to the optimization of the electronic structure resulting from enhanced electron transfer due to doping with impurity atoms. Detailed characterization showed that homogeneous V doping changed the morphology of Ni3S2 from nanosheets to nanorods; it also introduced additional catalytic active sites and significantly improved the electrocatalytic activity for the OER. In addition, V-Ni3S2/NF exhibited excellent electrocatalytic stability compared to noble-metal (IrO2) electrocatalysts. The introduction of vanadium suggests a new approach to the design of high-performance OER catalysts in alkaline medium. (C) 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

For alkaline OER, cat.-51.9 exhibits a low overpotential (282.3 mV at 20 mA cm(-2), 25.0 degrees C) and ultrastable catalysis at 51.9 degrees C (250 h, with a negligible activity decay of 19.6 mu V h(-1)). The experimental observations combined with theoretical analyses confirm the fast catalytic kinetics enabled by the co-effect of boundaries and vacancies. The coupled cat.-51.9 and MoO2-Ni hydrogen-evolving arrays provide stable electrolysis operation at 51.9 degrees C for 220 h. This work uncovers new reconstruction phenomenon of pre-catalysts under realistic conditions and exceptional durability of CR catalysts toward practical high-temperature AWE.									80	4	0	0	5	0	80			0935-9648	1521-4095		WOS:000565584700001	32876959	
J	Takahashi, Koh					Takahashi, Koh/0000-0002-6705-6303			The Low Detection Rate of Pair-instability Supernovae and the Effect of the Core Carbon Fraction								ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL				863	2					153	10.3847/1538-4357/aad2d2				AUG 20 2018	2018	The pair-instability supernova (PISN) is a common fate of very massive stars (VMSs). Current theory predicts initial and CO core mass ranges for PISNe of similar to 140-260 and similar to 65-120 M-circle dot, respectively, for stars that are not much affected by the wind mass loss. The corresponding relative event rate between PISNe and core-collapse supernovae is estimated to be similar to 1% for the present-day initial mass function. However, no confident PISN candidate has been detected so far, despite more than 1000 supernovae being discovered every year. We investigate the evolution of VMSs with various core carbon-to-oxygen ratios for the first time by introducing a multiplication factor f(cag) is an element of [0.1, 1.2] to the C-12(alpha, gamma)O-16 reaction rate. We find that a less massive VMS with a high X(C)/X(O) develops shell convection during the core carbon-burning phase, with which the star avoids the pair-creation instability. The second result is the high explodability for a massive VMS; i.e., a star with high X (C)/X(O) explodes with a smaller explosion energy. Consequently, the initial and CO core mass ranges for PISNe are significantly increased. Finally, a PISN with high X(C)/X(O) yields a smaller amount of Ni-56. Therefore, PISNe with high X(C)/X(O) are much rarer and fainter. This result advances the first theory to decrease the PISN event rate by directly shifting the CO core mass range.									17	0	0	0	0	0	17			0004-637X	1538-4357		WOS:000442222700015

The HOMO-LUMO gaps indicate that char donates electrons to CO2, which is tempted by small electron confinement capability of the surface active C atom. In single-site adsorption, the carbonyl-type oxygen groups can be formed, whereas the heterocyclic oxygen and the lactone groups can be formed via dual-site adsorption. It was found that the former process is endothermic and the latter process is exothermic. In this study, CO2 chemisorption products can be influenced by the electronic environment in terms of the optimized bond length. The reaction channels accounted for CO desorption from char-CO2 complex and the evolution from lactone group to a cyclic ether structure were determined. The rate coefficients were evaluated by transition state theory theory in the temperature range of 300-2500 K. The results showed that the CO desorption reaction is competitive, and the evolution from lactone group to a cyclic ether structure is kinetically supported. In addition, the carbonyl-type oxygen groups are more likely converted from heterocyclic oxygen groups instead of direct single-site adsorption.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			0010-2202	1563-521X		WOS:000378527400006

A similar to 15-nm-thick Pt center dot MoO3-x film was prepared by one-pot electrodeposition at -0.8 V for 1 ms. Due to considerably different solute concentrations, the content of Pt atoms in the electrode-posited composite electrocatalyst is low. No Pt crystals or islands were observed on the flat Pt center dot MoO3-x films, indicating that Pt atoms were homogeneously dispersed within the MoO3-x thin film. The catalytic performance and physicochemical features of Pt center dot MoO3-x as a HER electrocatalyst were characterized. The results showed that our Pt center dot MoO3-x film exhibits 23- and 11-times higher current density than Pt and MoO3-x electrodeposited individually under the same conditions, respectively. It was found that the dramatic enhancement in the HER performance was principally due to the abundant oxygen defects. The use of the developed one-pot electrodeposition and doping method can potentially be extended to various catalytically active metal oxides or hydroxides for enhanced performance in various energy storage and conversion applications.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2095-025X	2095-0268		WOS:000853039900002

The electrocatalytic activities of pure and M-modified cobalt oxyhydroxides (M = Ni or Mn) nanowires have been investigated in detail for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in an alkaline environment. The pure, Ni-, and Mn-modified nanowires, with preferentially exposed low-index surfaces, were fabricated directly on stainless steel mesh current collectors using an inexpensive and scalable chemical synthesis procedure. The unique electrode structure ensures excellent substrate-catalyst electrical contact and increases the surface area accessible to the electrolyte. The OER activity of CoOOH nanowires is shown to be significantly improved through incorporation of Ni. Specifically, optimal OER activity is obtained for CoOOH nanowires with 9.7% surface Ni content, which corresponds to four-times greater current density compared to pure CoOOH. In contrast, Mn modification of the CoOOH nanowires did not improve the OER activity. Tafel analysis suggests Ni incorporation leads to change in the OER rate-determining step based on an observed decrease in the Tafel slope. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy reveals that Ni incorporation improves the ability of the catalysts to stabilize surface intermediates, whereas Mn incorporation impedes intermediate stabilization. This study provides new insights regarding the influence of transition metal impurities on the OER activity of CoOOH and provides a clear strategy for the optimization of CoOOH-based OER catalysts in alkaline electrolytes.									123	4	0	0	5	0	125			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000392413600043

To be competitively applicable at large scales, the electrocatalytic water-splitting system needs electrocatalysts that are cost effective, highly efficient, and highly durable. A novel metal-organic-framework (MOF)-derived and SiO2-protected phosphorization approach was developed to prepare hollow nanocubes composed of well-dispersed Ni5P4/Fe3P in N-doped carbon as cost-effective OER electrocatalysts, which are highly efficient and durable at high current density operations. Because of their unique structural and compositional features, the N-doped C/Ni5P4/Fe3P hollow nanocubes not only achieved excellent electrocatalytic efficiencies (eta(10) - 252 mV and eta(250) - 385 mV), but also outstanding electrocatalytic activities with an ultralow Tafel slope of 24.0 mV dec(-1), the lowest ever reported to the best of our knowledge. More importantly, the N-doped C/Ni5P4/Fe3P hollow nanocubes exhibited eminent long-term stability, both electrocatalytically and mechanically, even at a high current density of 250 mA cm(-2). These outstanding performances make the developed N-doped C/Ni5P4/Fe3P hollow nanocubes a promising candidate to replace commercial noble metal oxide-based OER electrocatalysts for large-scale applications.									77	5	0	0	3	0	79			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000411739700012

Herein, the effects of atomic and electronic structures on the electrocatalytic performance of Mo/oxides core-shell structures are investigated on the basis of the combination of ex situ and in situ experiments. First, a two-step reaction pathway is revealed during the oxidation of nanoscale Mo: the formation of amorphous MoO3 (A-MoO3) shells followed by the nucleation of crystalline alpha-MoO3. It is shown that the electrocatalytic performance of A-MoO3 is superior to that of alpha-MoO3, mainly due to more catalytically active sites in the former material. Furthermore, in situ transmission electron microscopy observations show that the A-MoO3 shell can be rapidly reduced into metallic MoO2 under reductive environment, which is likely to occur during the hydrogen evolution reaction measurement. Our in-depth characterization may contribute to the thorough and comprehensive understanding of the structural transition in Mo and its oxides during oxidative and reductive environments and thus serves as a reference for understanding the structure-property interplay for real energy applications.									4	1	0	0	0	0	5			2574-0962			WOS:000502688800084

Herein, metal-free N-doped porous carbon fibers (NPCF) is reported by carbonization, activation and nitrogen-doping of natural cattails. The carbon fibers possess high specific surface area (765 m(2) g(-1)) and lots of micropores. Excellent catalytic performances of NPCF are illustrated for HER from electrolysis of water in acidic media. An onset overpotential of 70 mV with a low Tafel slope of 135 mV.dec(-1) was observed for NPCF electrode. The electrocatalytic properties of NPCF are much better than those of commercial graphite powder, carbon nanotubes and super-P. NPCF also shows promising electrochemical durability with only 3% recession of current density after 20 h continuous operations. The high catalytic activities of NPCF are attributed to the relatively high specific surface area, abundant micropores, strong electrical conductivity, the high stability of biomass-derived carbon matrix and suitable N content. The preparation and high activities for HER of NPCF offer a novel idea for the promising preparation of metal-free carbon materials derived from earth-abundant biomass for more efficient and cleaner bulk chemical production.									15	2	0	0	1	0	16			0022-4596	1095-726X		WOS:000467663700029

During the pyrolysis process, volatile CNx species from dicyandiamide were trapped by ZIF-67@Ni-ZIF nanosheets, simultaneously introducing nitrogen atom into carbon matrix to achieve the rich-defect porous nanotubes and abundant cavity structure. The as-prepared nanomaterials can simultaneously boost the ORR, OER and HER catalytic activity with strong durability. Significantly, the CoNi@NCNTs-700 exhibits excellent electrocatalytic activity including half-wave potential (E-ORR,E- 1/2) of 0.80 V, lower operating voltage (E-OER,E- 10) of 1.60 V at 10 mA cm(-2) and potential difference (Delta E) of 0.80 V between E-OER,E- 10 to E-ORR,E- 1/2 in 0.1 M KOH, and low overpotential (EHER, 10) of -0.130 V reaching 10 mA cm(-2) in acidic medium. The remarkable activity is ascribed to defect-rich porous carbon nanotubes structure and the synergistic effect between CoNi alloy nanoparticles, N-dope carbon and CoNi-Nx. And hollow structure facilitates to improve conductivity and stability. This work offers a useful archetypical template to design and construct efficient and stable trifunctional electrocatalysts, illustrating its viability for practical applications of energy conversion and storage devices.									30	4	0	0	1	0	31			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000580627000052

Hence, we obtain the stretchable films (denoted as PMC) by casting the solution of hydrothermal MWCNTs (ho-MWCNTs) and poly (vinyl alcohol) (PVA), following the Ni(OH)(2) deposited on PMC (denoted as PMC/Ni). XPS and XRD confirmed the charge transfer between ho-MWCNTs and PVA, which means generation of electronic delocalization center. Furthermore, the alignment of ho-MWCNTs could be observed by SEM. Meanwhile, PMC/Ni exhibited excellent catalytic performance for OER and HER in 1 M KOH. It only require 320 mV to achieve 20 mA cm(-2) for OER and a low overpotential of -219 mV to achieve 10 mA cm(-2) for HER in 1 M KOH. The results verify that orientated ho-MWCNTs have a positive effect in promoting catalytic performance by promoting to faster electron transfer and more active sites. Hence, we believe that the catalytic performance of other hollow-tubes materials would show a strong relationship with the orientation, which needs more efforts to research.

We report a simple and scalable modified Adams fusion method for preparing highly OER active, chlorine-free iridium oxide nanoparticles of various size and shape. The applied approach allows for the effects of particle size, morphology, and the nature of the surface species on the OER activity of IrO2 to be investigated. Iridium oxide synthesized at 350 degrees C from Ir(acac)(3), consisting of 1.7 +/- 0.4 nm particles with a specific surface area of 150 m(2) g(-1), shows the highest OER activity (E = 1.499 +/- 0.003 V at 10 A g(ox)(-1)). Operando X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) studies indicate the presence of iridium hydroxo (Ir-OH) surface species, which are strongly linked to the OER activity. Preparation of larger IrO2 particles using higher temperatures results in a change of the particle morphology from spherical to rod-shaped particles. A decrease of the intrinsic OER activity was associated with the predominant termination of the rod-shape particles by highly ordered (110) facets in addition to limited diffusion within mesoporous features.									251	5	0	0	16	0	255			0897-4756	1520-5002		WOS:000384399000024

Herein, Co3O4 nanoparticles interconnecting with nitrogen-doped carbon architectures (denoted as Co3O4/NC) was developed on nickel foam surface by a two-step solvothermal process and followed by calcination. A metal organic framework (MOF) of laminar CoMOE-NH2 was synthesized firstly by in-situ transformation of Co-2(OH)(3)Cl array. Then, porous Co3O4/NC nanosheets were obtained by controlled heat treatment of CoMOE-NH2. The Co3O4/NC supported by nickel foam can be directly used as self-supported electrodes for electrocatalysis without any binders. As-synthesized Co3O4/NC acts as effective catalysis for oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Interestingly, the optimized electrochemical efficiency for OER was achieved by Co3O4/NC nanosheet with overpotentials of 235 mV and 264 mV offering current densities of 10 mA/cm(2) and 100 mA/cm(2), respectively. It also has a relatively low Tafel slope, which indicates the fast electron transfer kinetics of the catalyst. So Co3O4/NC nanosheet has great potential in replacing precious metal electrocatalysts in OER application.									27	2	0	0	1	0	27			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000608516100002

In this work, a mixed anion electrocatalyst, namely, amorphous molybdenum phosphosulfide films containing oxygen were produced via a simple electrochemical process allowing the composition and morphology of the film to be controlled. The catalyst shows a homogeneous distribution of Mo, S, P, and O with a high number of active sites due to its amorphous state. (NH4)(2)MoS4 was used as a molybdenum and sulfur source, while NaPO2H2 was used as the phosphorus source. Thiourea was also investigated as an additional sulfur source during the electrodeposition process. The electrocatalyst was active for the HER in acidic media as expected, but showed excellent performance in alkaline media where Tafel slope values of 36 and 122 mV dec(-1) were recorded, respectively. In addition, the electrocatalyst demonstrated long-term stability in both media for several hours. The materials were characterized using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and their physicochemical properties correlated to their electrocatalytic activity for the HER.									20	0	0	0	1	0	19			2574-0962			WOS:000458705800058

This composite is synthesized by two steps procedure involving preparation of Cu/NPCC according to templating method through direct carbonization of metal organic framework-199 (MOP-199) as a template in N-2 atmosphere at 900 degrees C. This procedure is followed by partial galvanic replacement of Cu metals by Pt-IV ions, upon immersion in a hexachloroplatinic acid solution. The physical and electrochemical characterization of the materials are achieved by X-ray diffraction (XRD), energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), nitrogen adsorption/desorption and cyclic voltammetry (CV) methods. The EDS analysis has proven that the partial galvanic replacement is occurred. This composite is tested for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in 0.5 M H2SO4 solution. The linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) results have shown that the Cu-Pt/NPCC modified glassy carbon electrode (GCE) exhibit higher current density and less negative value of potential towards HER rather than the bare GCE. This is attributed to synergetic effect of the Cu-Pt bimetallic catalyst and uniform distribution of the Pt nanoparticles at the electrode surface. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Herein, we provide a collaborative self-templating method to prepare a hybrid catalyst of nanoporous CoP nanowire (NWs) arrays decorated with carbon-coated CoP nanoparticles (NPs). It's found that the unique structure and morphology of the resultant catalyst can provide abundant available active sites and faciliatate the rapid H-2/O-2 transmission. Additionally, the N-doped carbon improves the conductivity of the catalyst and prevents the aggregation and deactivation of CoP nanoparticles. Forthermore, the strong coupling and synergistic effects by interface engineering are also conducive to the electrochemical performance. Benefiting from these advantages, the CoP NWs/CoP NPs@NC/CC only needs a low overpotential of 103 mV to achieve 10 mA cm(-2) with a small Tafel slope of 87 mV dec(-1) for HER. When employed in an electrolytic cell as an electrocatalyst for overall water splitting, a low voltage of 1.60 V is required to drive 10 mA cm(-2). This study may provide a novel way to fabricate transitionmetal-based catalysts for water splitting.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0363-907X	1099-114X		WOS:000780925300001

We report LnBaCo(2)O(5+delta) (Ln = lanthanide) perovskites as highly active electrocatalysts for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). The tolerance factor (t(f)) and O p/Co d-band centers are proposed to be efficient descriptors for addressing their electrochemical performance. The t(f) endows the HER activity/stability with a volcano shape for our synthesized double/simple perovskites. The O p/Co d-band centers locating far from the Fermi level (E-F) results in the best activity of LnBaCo(2)O(5+delta) among the LnBaCo(2)O(5+delta) perovskites. The outstanding stability can be explained by having the O p/Co d-band centers neither close to nor far from the E-F. The maximum HER activity benefits from optimal free energy combination for the adsorption/dissociation of H2O and desorption of -OH/H*. The proper t(f) values and O p/Co d-band centers may realize synergistic interplay, which is crucial to reasonably design the oxide materials.									10	0	0	0	0	0	10			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000697428600003

However, recent experimental observations that the exfoliation of GaSe into atomically thin layers enhances performances in electrochemistry and photocatalysis have opened new avenues for its applications in the fields of energy and catalysis. Here, it is demonstrated by surface-science experiments and density functional theory (DFT) that the oxidation of GaSe into Ga2O3, driven by Se vacancies and edge sites created in the exfoliation process, plays a pivotal role in catalytic processes. Specifically, both hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) are energetically unfavorable in pristine GaSe, due to energy barriers of 1.9 and 5.7-7.4 eV, respectively. On the contrary, energy barriers are reduced concurrently with surface oxidation. Especially, the Heyrovsky step (H-ads + H+ + e(-) -> H-2) of HER becomes energetically favorable only in sub-stoichiometric Ga2O2.97(-0.3 eV/H+). It is also discovered that the same mechanisms occur for the case of the parental compound indium selenide (InSe), thus ensuring the validity of the model for the broad class of III-VI layered semiconductors.									19	1	0	0	0	0	19			1616-301X	1616-3028		WOS:000567837700001

Their catalytic performance benefits from the vacancy defects of these electrolytes. However, the facile and effective generation of vacancy defects is still a challenge, and the role of vacancy defects is also unclear. In this work, an efficient radio-frequency (RF) plasma treatment strategy has been employed to achieve sulfur vacancies and oxygen vacancies in electrocatalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction. H-2, Ar/H-2, and Ar were used for the generation of plasma, respectively. Plasma treatment was found to reduce Co3+ to Co2+, and create sulfur and oxygen vacancy defects on the surface of cobalt compounds and graphene. The reactive radicals generated by plasma reduce graphene oxide to graphene nanosheets, which provide space for the movement of carriers and nanoparticles. Among the three different plasma systems, the H-2 plasma has the most prominent ability to create vacancy defects in the electrocatalysts. The XRD pattern and Raman spectrum of the catalyst prepared by H-2 plasma show large displacement, indicating that the plasma is responsible for changing the lattice parameters and cell volume, and vacancy defect structure of the sample. The overpotential of H-2-V-S/rGO was 340 mV at 50 mA cm(-2) and the Tafel slope was 84.4 mV dec(-1). After 12 hours of amperometric i-t curve test, its OER performance was found to surpass that of IrO2. DFT calculation results show that the vacancy defects effectively regulate the electronic structure, enhance the electron migration efficiency and promote the adsorption process of OER. The method of plasma treatment for creating vacancy structures is facile and effective, which provides a new route for the preparation of OER catalysts.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			2052-1553			WOS:000814723900001

The doping process was conducted in combination with the photocatalytic water oxidation reaction which was catalyzed by ZMO in neutral phosphate-buffered aqueous solution containing [Ru(bpy)(3)](2+)-Na2S2O8 and calcium(II) triflate salt, exhibiting greatly enhanced water oxidation performance with optimized turnover frequency of 0.18 mmol(o2) mol(Mn)(-1) s(-1). Different analytical techniques indicated that photodeposited calcium-phosphate (CaP) acted as a co-catalyst to promote the O-2 evolution activity of ZMO. This system involved the use of manganese oxide and calcium ion, and the operation was conducted under ambient temperature and neutral conditions, thus, it efficiently mimicked the oxygen-evolving complex in photosystem II.

We also investigate the effect of the additional input parameter-the WD composition-on nova characteristics by calculating evolutionary sequences with pure-carbon and pure-oxygen WD progenitors. The stellar evolution code used includes an extended nuclear reactions network, OPAL opacities, and diffusion of all elements.Our main conclusions are that CO progenitors reproduce most of the observed abundances and abundance ratios, and that correlations between them, if any, are in very good agreement with observations. The WD composition is generally not reflected in the abundances of the ejecta: whereas a large fraction of the carbon is always turned into nitrogen, oxygen is in some cases unaffected and in others almost completely destroyed. Hence ejecta abundances cannot be used to deduce the WD composition. Ejected masses of pure O WD progenitors exceed those of CO progenitors, sometimes by a factor of 4.The isotopes C-13 and O-17 are in all cases significantly overabundant, compared to the solar composition: C-12/C-13 varies between 0.97 and 3.8 (by number) and O-16/O-17 varies between 1.8 and 55; N-15, however, is sometimes greatly enhanced and sometimes underabundant, N-14/N-15 varying over a very wide range, from 2.4 to 33,000.									79	0	0	0	0	0	79			0004-637X			WOS:A1997WK03700031

Hydrogen (H-2) is considered as an ideal energy resource due to its nontoxic, pollution-free, high utilization rate, and high calorific combustion value. Electrolysis of water driven by the electricity generated from renewable and clean energy sources (e.g., solar energy, wind energy) to produce hydrogen attracts great efforts for hydrogen production with high purity. Recently, the breakthrough of the catalyst activity limit for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) catalysts has received extensive attention. Comparatively, fewer reviews have focused on the long-term stability of HER catalysts, which is indeed decisive for large-scale electrolytic industrialization. Therefore, a systematic summary concentrated on the durability of HER electrocatalysts would provide a fundamental understanding of the electrocatalytic performance for practical applications and offer new opportunities for the rational design of the highly performed HER electrocatalysts. This review summarizes the research progress toward the HER stability of precious metals, transition metals, and metal-free electrocatalysts in the past few years. It discusses the challenges in the stability of HER electrocatalysts and the future perspectives. We anticipate that it would provide a valuable basis for designing robust HER electrocatalysts.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0				2567-3165		WOS:000842945100001

In this work, an ex-situ experimental system of UCG was built, and a series of experiments were carried out with different gasification agents and flow rates to study the concentration and composition of tar samples from different positions and time. Shenmu bituminous coal is cut into specific blocks with drilled holes as initial gasification channel and sampling channels. Tar concentration is calculated according to the weight of tar samples and the corresponding gas flow volume during sampling, while tar composition is analyzed by GC-MS. For the involved conditions, the maximum relative gap of tar concentrations between L = 36 cm and 102 cm is around 296% under 10 L/min oxygen case. The maximum relative gap of PAH percentage in tar between L = 36 cm and 102 cm is around 84% under 10 L/ min air case. For oxygen gasification, increasing flow rate from 10 L/min to 15 L/min causes a lower tar concentration at reaction zone and a higher tar concentration at outlet, as well as a lower PAH percentage for all positions. For air gasification, increasing flow rate from 10 L/min to 50 L/min leads to a more uniform distribution of tar concentration and composition. Tar concentration for air gasification is far smaller than that for oxygen gasification. Changing from 10 L/min to 15 L/min for oxygen gasification decreases the carbon emission in gases and increases the percentage of product tar. Changing from 10 L/min to 50 L/min for air gasification decreases the carbon emission in gases but increases the percentage of pollutant tar.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0016-2361	1873-7153		WOS:000783242100005

Developing eco-friendly, low-cost, stable, and highly active nonprecious hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) catalysts is one of key factors for hydrogen energy economy. Two-dimensional metal carbide and nitride (MXenes) materials have shown characteristics of promising HER catalysts. Herein, we explored the conductive and thermal stability and electrocatalyst performance of four 2D ordered double MXenes M-2'M '' C-2, Cr2TiC2, Cr2VC2, Mo2TiC2, and Mo2VC2, and their corresponding oxygen (O*)- or hydroxyl (OH*)-terminated MXenes by using density functional calculations. Results indicated that all the above MXenes are conductive, which are favored to charge transfer during HER. Four MXenes are fully terminated by O* under standard conditions [pH = 0, p(H-2) = 1 bar, U = 0 V]. The Gibbs free energy for the adsorption of atomic hydrogen (Delta G(H*)) on the O*-terminated M-2'M '' C-2 (e.g., Cr2TiC2O2) is close to 0 eV (the ideal value) at suitable H coverage. The formability of oxygen vacancy in the fully O*-terminated M-2'M '' C-2, that is, M-2'M '' C2O2 was studied, and a linear relationship between the formation energy of oxygen vacancy (E-f) and Delta G(H*) was obtained. The electronic structure analysis indicates that the more electrons gained by the terminated O* from M-2'N '' C-2, the higher is the occupation of the p orbitals of the terminated O* and thus the weaker is the binding strength between the terminated O* and the adsorbed H. Our results indicated that O*-terminated M-2'M '' C-2 are promising HER electrocatalysts for generating hydrogen by water splitting.									60	5	0	0	0	0	62			1932-7447	1932-7455		WOS:000453488300034

Most transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) show excellent catalytic activity, which stems from their active sites located along the edges. However, small density of the active sites in the basal plane, largely limits TMDs performance. To enhance the HER catalysis activity of MoS2, we developed an efficient and scalable approach to significantly increase the overall electrochemically active sites using mild sodium hypochlorite (NaClO) solution anisotropic etching. The effect is further enhanced by oxygen-plasma pretreatment of the material, which - upon chemical etching - leads to highly porous and highly reactive structure. The resulting chemically activated MoS2 (ca-MoS2) was systematically characterized and optimized. The optimized ca-MoS2 powder exhibits enhanced HER performance with an overpotential of 0.34 V at a current density of 0.5 mA cm(-2) in this experiment due to the increasing active sites, and the Tafel slope also smaller than other samples. This chemical etching method provides new ways to design atomic structure modification, including controlling layered TMD electrochemical property and new type of transistor fabrication.									61	4	0	0	6	0	62			2211-2855	2211-3282		WOS:000458419000055

Developing a more efficient, chemically stable, green and cost-effective catalytic devices for commercial use still remains a challenging task. In this research work, we have designed a new kind of hetero nanostructured hierarchical electrode BaTiO3/NiFe2O4 composite by facile hydrothermal process. The sluggish oxygen-evolving reaction is one of the major challenge in water technology (OER). The prepared photocatalyst exhibited excellent photocatalytic activity towards OER. The prepared electrodes' physicochemical behaviors have been studied using a variety of spectroscopic techniques include powder X-ray diffraction, UV-Vis diffuse reflectance spec-troscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and Transmission electron microscopy. The HR-TEM results of pristine BaTiO3 show partially agglomerated nanoparticles which are in spherical shape with size ranging from 50 to 78 nm, whereas pure NiFe2O4 displays needle-like nanorods with average width and length of the needles are around 31 nm and 1.5 mu m respectively and the BaTiO3/NiFe2O4 composite shows combination of nano -particles with nanorods. XPS analysis has revealed the oxygen vacancies and composition of the materials. The optical band gap investigation showed that the composites Eg value is in the visible region. UV-Vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy revealed that the hierarchical BaTiO3/NiFe2O4 composite has enhanced absorption in the visible region. The photocatalytic activity results show that, the prepared BaTiO3/NiFe2O4 composite pho-toelectrode yields a photocurrent density of 0.34 mA/cm(2) at 1.6 V vs SCE reference electrode confirms their PEC water splitting ability. These observed findings of the hetero-composite clearly make a way to employ them as the plausible electrode for effectual oxygen evolution reaction.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0272-8842	1873-3956		WOS:000848660700004

As a novel 2D transition-metal carbide, Ti3C2 nanosheets (MXenes) have been recently considered as a promising N-2 reduction reaction (NRR) active center. However, little of the expected progress in the use of Ti3C2 for photocatalytic N-2 fixation has been achieved. Herein, we report a novel 2D/2D Ti3C2/N-defect g-C3N4 heterostructure photocatalyst exhibiting highly enhanced photocatalytic nitrogen fixation activity, with an NH3 yield of 5.792 mg h(-1) g(-1). This study demonstrates that the heterostructure was constructed by filling the oxygen-terminals of Ti3C2 in the N-defects of g-C3N4 to form C-O-Ti interactions. Together, the construction of the hetero-interface and the introduction of N-defects contribute to rapid interfacial charge transfer to the active sites. Importantly, the exposed edge Ti of Ti3C2 was confirmed to be the active site for N-2 adsorption and activation, and these active Ti sites exhibit desirable NRR selectivity via suppressing the competing HER. Finally, a mechanism for photocatalytic N-2 fixation was proposed to reveal the evolution of the redox circle that originated from the multi-valence Ti species during the N-2 adsorption, activation, and dissociation process.									16	1	0	0	2	0	16			2044-4753	2044-4761		WOS:000618190800025

The modulation of Co/Zn ratio in bimetallic MOF precursors can not only regulate spatial dispersion and local structural disorder of Co cores, but also lead to the alterable proportion of the component nitrogen types in catalysts, which impacts the charge distribution of the carbon sheath and further ameliorates the charge transfer. Moreover, urea, an assisted nitrogen/carbon source, plays an active role in the formation and growth of N-doped carbon nanotubes. Such Co-N-C system results in more provided active sites (e.g., Co and Co-N-x moieties), noncorrosive metal cores protected by carbon materials as well as short diffusion pathway of ions due to the synergetic effect of core-sheath structure. Benefiting from these controllable strategies, C1Z1 (pyrolysis product of Co0.5Zn0.5-ZIF and urea precursor) embraces the current density of 10mAcm(-2) at the overpotential of 251 and 279mV for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in acid and alkaline media, respectively, which enables it to be an efficient electrocatalyst for HER under both extreme pH conditions.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			2699-9412			WOS:000783855700010

Synthesis of layered polysilane								MATERIALS RESEARCH BULLETIN				31	3			307	316		10.1016/0025-5408(95)00195-6				MAR 1996	1996	Deintercalation of calcium from the interlayer of CaSi2 was performed by using concentrated HCl solutions at low temperatures, 0 and -30 degrees C. In the reaction at 0 degrees C, the deintercalation took place in two steps with evolution of 1/2 mole of hydrogen per mole of CaSi2 in each step. In the reaction at -30 degrees C, little evolution of hydrogen was observed. The quantitative chemical analysis, infrared and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopies, and X-ray powder diffraction measurements revealed that the solid obtained by the reaction at -30 degrees C was a non-oxidized layered polysilane (Si6H6)(n) with incorporation of chlorine in a molar ratio of Cl/Si=1/6. The optical band gap of the layered polysilane was measured to be 2.4 eV. The deintercalation was topotactic, and the layered polysilane reverted to Si platelet crystals on heating at 900 degrees C in vacuum.									102	0	0	0	5	0	106			0025-5408			WOS:A1996TY90300009

Here we describe the effect of lithium (Li+)-substitution into nickel oxide on the electrocatalytic activity towards OER in alkaline electrolyte. The X-ray diffraction patterns of lithiated nickel oxides (LixNi1-xO, x = 0.00-0.50) synthesized by the solution-combustion method suggest that pure phase of lithiated nickel oxide was formed until x = 0.30; thereafter, a secondary phase of LiNiO2 was observed. Rietveld analysis showed that Li+-substitution caused a contraction in the lattice structure as shown by the decrease in lattice parameters upon Li+-substitution. Further, the weight fraction of LiNiO2 was found to be dominant for x = 0.50. Deconvolution of the high resolution X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy for O 1s and Ni 2p spectra suggested that concentration of oxygen vacancies increased linearly, whereas that of Ni3+ increased till x = 0.30 and it decreased when Li+-substitution was further increased to x = 0.40 and 0.50. Although electrical conductivity increased upon Li+-substitution, no significant effect was observed for lithiated samples with varying Li+-content (x = 0.10-0.50). The activities for OER were measured using the rotating disk electrode in 0.5 M NaOH electrolyte, and the data suggest that lithiated nickel oxide synthesized with x = 0.30 shows the highest current density at 1.70 vs. RHE (V). The decrease in OER activity for x = 0.40 and 0.50 was attributed to the decline in OER active Ni3+ sites (probably due to the presence of chemically unstable LiNiO2). (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Valine and aspartic acid readily form peptides with glycine; self-condensation is observed for all acids except valine. Several findings give further indications towards the possible prebiotic relevance of the reaction: the observed preferential formation of peptide linkages, the shift from 'nature-irrelevant' to 'nature-relevant' peptide bonds in the presence of Cu(II) and the long conservation of optical purity in the reaction system. Additional data confirming the proposed reaction mechanism were obtained.									16	0	0	0	4	0	16			0020-1693	1873-3255		WOS:A1993LB77600002

In addition to functioning as a halogenating enzyme and a classical peroxidase, CPO catalyzes the dismutation of peroxides in a catalase-type reaction and carries out cytochrome P450 oxygen insertion reactions. From the viewpoint of biocatalysis the most important CPO reactions are chiral epoxidations, hydroxylations, and sulfoxidations. CPO catalyzes a variety of chiral epoxidation reactions with high yields and high enantioselectivities. However, the industrial use of native CPO for the synthesis of chiral epoxides is limited because of its relatively low epoxidation rates in comparison to its high catalase activity, which robs the epoxidation reaction of oxidant. The use of CPO is also restricted by its poor reactivities in organic solvents. Directed evolution technology has been used to address these problems. After three rounds of PCR-based random mutagenesis, we have isolated mutants of chloroperoxidase having greatly enhanced epoxidation activity compared to the wild-type enzyme. In addition, hi the screening of a first generation library of random mutation transformants, we have isolated three CPO mutant clones having improved chlorination activity and enhanced stability in a ternary solvent microemulsion comprised Or toluene, isopropanol and water. Surprisingly, all three recombinant variants carry a single mutation ill the cysteine residue that functions as the proximal heme ligand in the native enzyme. Two of these mutant clones are identical, having the proximal cysteine heme-ligand replaced with a tyrosine residue. The third mutant has the cysteine-29 replaced with a histidine residue. The cysteine mutation iii the three mutants is the only amino acid replacement. All other mutations in the three clones were silent mutations. These data suggest that "directed evolution" can be successfully applied to the engineering or chloroperoxidase in the quest for a better industrial biocatalyst.									46	2	0	0	27	0	47			1615-4150			WOS:000170859000018

However, they suffer from electrochemical corrosion at high anodic potentials in aqueous electrolytes. This study demonstrates that highly graphitized platelet-type carbon nanofibers (pCNFs) are tolerant to electrochemical corrosion under oxygen evolution reaction (OER) conditions in a concentrated KOH electrolyte. An identical-location scanning electron microscopy study showed that the corrosion rate of the carbon edge plane of the pCNFs is very low compared with that of the carbon basal plane. Further scanning transmission electron microscopy/electron-energy loss spectroscopy studies indicate that the carbon edge plane of the pCNFs is covered with hydroxyl groups, whereas the oxygen-containing species are limited to the carbon basal plane. Thus, most surfaces of highly graphitized pCNFs, consisting of the carbon edge plane, are passivated with hydroxyl groups, resulting in the high resistance of pCNFs to electrochemical corrosion. These findings provide a novel material design for carbon with a high corrosion resistance in the OER.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000772918100001

However, the catalytic activity sites are located at the limited edges and massive inert sites in the basal plane. Triggering the basal plane catalytic activity for the HER is desired to improve the catalytic behavior of monolayer MoS2. In this work, we studied the catalytic behavior of the grain boundaries (GBs) in monolayer MoS2 using first-principle calculations based on density functional theory (DFT). The results show that the Gibbs free energy for hydrogen adsorption on MoS2 can be greatly reduced from 1.93 eV on pristine MoS2 to 0.01 eV on MoS2 with GBs, which indicate that the presence of GBs in the MoS2 monolayer can trigger the basal plane catalytic activity for the HER. The S vacancy, the bridge site of the Mo-Mo dimer, and the top site of the S atom of the S-S dimer are the catalytically active sites. GBs could be a general way to generate new active sites in two-dimensional transition metal dichalcogenides, thus providing a new routine to improve the catalytic efficiency for the HER.									17	0	0	0	1	0	17			1868-2529	1868-5994		WOS:000446982300011

Nickel sulfide thin films (NiSx) are formed on conductive nickel foam substrates via chemical vapor deposition (CVD) at 300 ?C under low pressure condition. A single phase of Ni3S2 was produced by controlling the ratio of precursors. X-ray diffraction (XRD), field emission scanning electron spectroscopy (FESEM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and electrochemical measurements were conducted to characterize and compare properties of the samples. According to XRD and XPS data analysis, the growth of single phase and surface chemical composition of the Ni3S2 was confirmed on the substrate. The results showed that by changing the molar ratio of S/Ni, nickel sulfides are crystalized in different phases including Ni3S4, NiS and Ni3S2. Electrochemical measurements conducted for HER activity showed that the Ni3S2 phase has the lowest overpotential, 116 mV vs. RHE, in comparison with two other phases (NiS and Ni3S4). Ni3S2 possesses many accessible active sites with a relative electrochemical surface area of about 83. Finally, the Tafel slopes for Ni3S2, NiS and Ni3S4 were obtained to be 96, 154 and 197 mV/dec, respectively.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			0042-207X	1879-2715		WOS:000649683500001

In this study, all the pyrolysis products obtained under different pyrolysis temperatures were comprehensively analyzed by multiple techniques. The results showed that the aromatic nucleus were inclined to react with methyl radicals, forming char with abundant methyl substitution aromatic structure at low pyrolysis temperature. At medium pyrolysis temperature, dramatically condensation reaction occurred, resulting in the formation of aromatic protonated carbon and abundant polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) containing benzenoid rings joined by a carbon-carbon single bond remaining in char. The concentration of aliphatic hydrocarbons in light tar decreased dramatically and converted into light hydrocarbon gas compounds (especially H-2 and CH4). At high pyrolysis temperature, severe carbonation of char led to the formation of abundant PAHs with reduced aliphatic side chain in light tar. Tar precursors preferred to form larger PAHs due to occurrence of drastic secondary reaction. The contents and diversity of oxygen-/nitrogen-containing heteroatom compounds in heavy tar were significantly reduced with the increase of temperature. Finally, the devolatilization mechanism responsible for the evolution of chemical structure of Shenfu coal pyrolyzed at elevated temperatures was proposed.									9	1	0	0	0	0	10			0378-3820	1873-7188		WOS:000612201200004

Our experiments show the vital role of the carbon shell thickness for efficient utilization of Pt. Furthermore, density functional theory calculations suggest that the metal-core has a crucial role in achieving promising electrocatalytic properties. The thin carbon shell allows the desired access of Pt atoms to the vicinity of the NiFe core while protecting the metallic core from oxidation in the harsh acidic media. In acidic media, the performance of this Pt/NiFe@UTG catalyst with 0.02 at% Pt is the same as that of commercial Pt/C (10 and 200 mV overpotential to reach 10 and 200 mA cm(-2), respectively) with promising durability (5000 HER cycles). Our electrochemical characterization (cyclic voltammetry) shows no Pt specific peaks, indicating the existence of a very low Pt loading on the surface of the catalyst.

Ni(OH)(2)-NiS2/TM only needs an over-potential of 90 mV to deliver 10 mA cm(-2) in 1.0 M KOH.

The 5 V capacity increases with increasing amount of excess lithium y. In contrast to a recent literature report, the data demonstrate that excess oxygen is not needed to impart the 5 V capacity. With the samples having a significant amount of excess lithium y>0.1, the 4 V capacity increases with cycling while the 5 V capacity decreases. The 5 V capacities of the LiMn2-yLiyO4+/-delta spinels are explained on the basis of an electrochemical oxidation of Mn4+ or O2-, which subsequently results in a self-discharge reaction involving the evolution of oxygen from the lattice and a reduction of Mn4+ to Mn3+.

Although some electrodes prepared by hydrothermal synthesis have excellent performance, the cumbersome preparation process cannot meet the future application. Here, we fabricated the electrode with schistose stacked hemispherical structure by DC electroplating at high current density for a long time, subsequently, the composition of the electrode was changed by continuous redox reaction. The electrode combine the excellent hydrogen and oxygen evolution characteristics of Ni and Fe elements, and has a large specific surface area, which means that it can provide more active site in HER and OER, thus, the overpotential can be greatly reduced. The electrode has excellent performance of HER, with overpotential of 41 mV and 132 mV at current density of 10 and 100 mA cm(-2), respectively, in 1 M potassium hydroxide solution. In OER, the overpotential is 270 mV at current density of 100 mA cm(-2). In overall water splitting test, the electrode only needs 1.54 V to reach 10 mA cm(-2). At the same time, the prepared electrodes have good stability, and the cell voltage increases by only 1.4% even at 300 mA cm(-2) current density for 40 h.									18	0	0	0	0	0	18			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000498641500048

The catalysts are investigated with respect to HER activity and stability in alkaline electrolyte. On the basis of the structural analysis by X-ray diffraction, X-ray-induced photoelectron spectroscopy, and transmission electron microscopy, it is concluded that MeN4 sites seem to dominate the HER activity of these catalysts. There is a strong relation between the amount of MeN4 sites that are formed and the energy of formation related to these sites integrated at the edge of a graphene layer, as obtained from density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Our results show, for the first time, that the combination of two metals (Co and Mo) in a bimetallic (Co,Mo)-N-C catalyst allows hydrogen production with a significantly improved overpotential in comparison to its monometallic counterparts and other Me-N-C catalysts. By the combination of experimental results with DFT calculations, we show that the origin of the enhanced performance of our (Co,Mo)-N-C catalyst seems to be provided by an improved hydrogen binding energy on one MeN4 site because of the presence of a second MeN4 site in its close vicinity, as investigated in detail for our most active (Co,Mo)-N-C catalyst.

Pyrolysis is combined with an oxidation by O-2, H2O and/or CO2 of the resultant char. Here we propose an original approach to model the oxidation of a single char particle. The intrinsic chemical reactivity of the char surface is assessed by the reactive surface area (RSA). The evolution of the RSA upon the conversion of the particle (burn-off) is modelled by a specific kinetic law similar to the law used to model the evolution of active sites in catalysis. This approach is applied on experimental results taken from the literature for coal and wood chars for O-2, H2O or CO2 gasification. The evolution of the total surface area (TSA) is modelled by the random pore model. Diffusional limitations are also accounted for. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Zhao, Xiangyuan; He, Baoluo; Zhang, Jin; Du, Chengfeng; Ye, Qian; Liu, Shujuan								Electrodeposition of mesoporous Ni-Mo-O composite films for hydrogen evolution reaction								VACUUM				198						110888	10.1016/j.vacuum.2022.110888				APR 2022	2022	We have prepared mesoporous composite Ni-Mo-O films (Ni-Mo-O MCFs) on conductive Au substrates via electrodeposition with the help of a soft template, and determined the optimal electrodeposition conditions of the films such as ethanol concentration, rotate speed, and current density. The composition of the films can be adjusted with the deposition current density and ethanol content to a Ni content within 50-75 wt.%. Mesoporosity is constantly present and homogeneously distributed on the films with a pore diameter about 5 nm-10 nm, and the film thickness is uniform at 200 nm. We propose a mechanism for the Ni-Mo-O MCFs formation, and evaluate the electrocatalytic activity for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Results show that the Ni-Mo-O MCFs display an improved active surface area and higher catalytic activity for HER, and excellent stability for over 70 h in 1 M KOH solution. The overpotential can reach a value of 222.8 mV at 10 mA cm-2 current density, with a Tafel slope of 141.66 mV dec-1, compared to bare substrate (558.57 mV at 10 mA cm-2). The improved electrocatalytic performance of Ni-Mo-O MCFs is attributed to the synergetic effect of the larger actual surface and the enhanced electrochemical activity of the films.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			0042-207X	1879-2715		WOS:000747194100002

Its detailed location and function have not been identified, however. We substituted Cl- with a bromide ion (Br-) or an iodide ion (I-) in PSII and analyzed the crystal structures of PSII with Br- and I- substitutions. Substitution of Cl- with Br- did not inhibit oxygen evolution, whereas substitution of Cl- with I- completely inhibited oxygen evolution, indicating the efficient replacement of Cl- by I-. PSII with Br- and I- substitutions were crystallized, and their structures were analyzed. The results showed that there are 2 anion-binding sites in each PSII monomer; they are located on 2 sides of the Mn4Ca cluster at equal distances from the metal cluster. Anion-binding site 1 is close to the main chain of D1-Glu-333, and site 2 is close to the main chain of CP43-Glu-354; these 2 residues are coordinated directly with the Mn4Ca cluster. In addition, site 1 is located in the entrance of a proton exit channel. These results indicate that these 2 Cl- anions are required to maintain the coordination structure of the Mn4Ca cluster as well as the proposed proton channel, thereby keeping the oxygen-evolving complex fully active.									172	2	1	0	89	2	195			0027-8424			WOS:000266432700030	19433803

This study used a single-stage hydrothermal method to synthesize highly porous FeO-Co3O4 nanoparticles on oxidized graphite (GOX) sheets. The fabrication of FeO-Co3O4@GOX nanoparticles depends on the oxidation time. The optimal catalyst (FeO-Co3O4@GOX-10) showed higher activity toward the OER than Co3O4, FeO-Co3O4, FeO-Co3O4@GOX-5, and FeO-Co3O4@GOX-24. The FeO-Co3O4@GOX-10 catalyst exhibited a low overpotential and small Tafel slope of 0.23 V and 64 mV dec(-1), respectively, at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2), demonstrating enhanced specific activity and turnover frequency. The optimal catalyst played a synergistic role in accelerating the electron transfer process and accelerating the OER with faradaic efficiency of 95.3%. Moreover, the improved activity of the FeO-Co3O4@GOX-10 catalyst was attributed to enhanced active site exposure, fast charge transfer, and synergistic effect of FeO-Co3O4 and GOX. This study provides a new approach for the development of efficient, stable, and environmentally friendly hybrid catalysts for energy conversion applications.

Herein, ten kinds of transition metal (TM = Mn, Fe, Co, Cu, Mo, Ru, Rh, Pd, Ir and Pt) were doped in Ni3S2 matrix to design TM-Ni3S2 candidates, and their catalytic activities for overall water splitting were systematically explored based on density functional theory. Our results demonstrated that doping TM atoms is an effective tactic to boost the catalytic activity of Ni3S2 matrix. Among these candidates, Mn-Ni3S2, Fe-Ni3S2, and Ru-Ni3S2 exhibit the outstanding catalytic activity for water splitting, with the much lower overpotentials being just 0.02/0.29 V, 0.11/0.29 V and 0.01/0.33 V for HER/OER, respectively, which are equivalent to or even superior to the prevailing bifunctional catalysts. Particularly, d-band center was employed to reveal the origin of OER activity. Our findings may open up new routes for the design of advanced Ni3S2-based catalysts for water splitting and realize the wide-range applications of Ni3S2-based catalysts in fields of clean and renewable energy.									0	1	0	0	0	0	1			2468-8231			WOS:000714775200001

Interface engineeringenabled electronic regulation represents a powerful leverage to improve the intrinsic activity of earth-abundant electrocatalysts. Herein, we report a scalable hydroxycarbonate-assisted pyrolysis strategy to immobilize Janusstructured fine Ni/Ni2P nanoparticles onto hierarchical N-doped carbon nanosheet-grafted nanofibers (denoted as Ni/Ni2P@N-CNIF hereafter) for high-efficiency electrocatalytic OER. The strong coupling of fine Ni/Ni2P hetem-nanoparticles with the superstructured carbon substrate renders Ni/Ni2P@N-CNIF with regulated electronic state, sufficient anchored active sites, shortened distance for mass transport and enhanced structural stability. Consequently, the optimized Ni/Ni2P@N-CNIF exhibits extraordinary electrocatalytic OER activity and durability in KOH medium. As a proof-of-concept demonstration, when pairing Ni/Ni2P@N-CNIF with commercial Pt/C catalyst for overall water splitting, the assembled two-electrode electrolyzer outperforms the stateof-the-art RuO2 parallel to Pt/C-equipped counterpart. The concept of interface engineering and carbon hybridization herein may provide new inspirations for the future design of affordable and efficient electrocatalysts for various sustainable energy conversions.									19	0	0	0	0	0	18			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000696923100007

Bismuth vanadate (BiVO4) is a very promising photoanode material for this but suffers experimentally from poor catalytic performance for OER. Here, we theoretically explored, by means of density functional theory calculations, supporting single metal atoms (i.e., Ag, Au, Pd, and Pt) as an effective strategy to enhance the catalytic activity of BiVO4. The OER performance of different surfaces was evaluated with the intermediate adsorption energies from a thermodynamic viewpoint. The electronic structure study was employed in details to comprehend the adsorption-changing mechanism. Based on the results, several linear relationships were derived among the adsorption energies of reaction intermediates in this work, and a volcano plot was presented to unravel the theoretical activities over different BiVO4 surfaces. It was found that the metal center dominated the interaction with the intermediates and the substrate played an instrumental role in achieving a qualified energy-level matching requirement for bonding. A new method for calculating the d-band center of singe-metal atoms was proposed to describe the correlation of intermediate adsorption strengths and electronic structure quantificationally. Moreover, this work could provide some in-depth understanding of the excellent performance of single-atom catalysts and open some new perspectives for catalysts design.									8	0	0	0	0	0	8			1932-7447	1932-7455		WOS:000449888600006

Employing solid FeOOH NSs coated with a thin layer of SiO2 as the template and Ni(NO3)(2)center dot 6H(2)O as the reagent, 2D nickel silicate (Ni3Si4O10(OH)(2)center dot 5H(2)O) nanosheets were grown on the surface of the FeOOH spindles through a facile solvothermal method to produce hierarchical FeOOH@Ni3Si4O10(OH)(2)center dot 5H(2)O hybrid NSs. Following a subsequent phosphorization treatment, the as-prepared solid composite NSs were successfully converted into FeP/Ni2P HNSs. The SiO2 nanocoating was found to play a crucial role in this synthesis, and served not only as a reagent for the solvothermal reaction, but also as a nanoreactor for preserving the template morphology after the phosphorization treatment. Benefiting from the unique hollow and hierarchical nanoscaled hybrid structure, the FeP/Ni2P HNS electrocatalyst displays superior electrocatalytic activity for the OER to FexP, Ni2P and the physical mixture of FexP and Ni2P samples, achieving an overpotential of 234 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) in 1 M KOH and a relatively low Tafel slope of 56 mV dec(-1).									83	6	0	0	4	0	86			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000443116700010

From the structural and morphological characterization it has been stated that the presence of Er3+ induces the promotion of luminescence. Moreover the incorporation of erbium clearly affects to the morphology YVO4 leading to 200 nm size well-defined spindle-like particles. The improved photocatalytic performance might be associated to a better electron-hole separation mechanism, probably due to the slight increase of band-gap value. The obtained photoactivities for H-2 and O-2 evolution reactions make this material a promising candidate for water splitting reactions. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Identifying reaction centers discloses the reaction mechanism and will undoubtedly facilitate the design and optimization of efficient water splitting electrocatalysts. This review summarizes several advances involving the identification of the actual active sites and intermediates capture on the catalytic surface. The morphology and valence states change on 2D materials are chose to illustrate how structural evolution affect catalytic activity. Specifically, in situ/ex situ electron microscopy techniques that used for the characterization of catalytic sites, and spectroscopy techniques that used to detect active intermediates at the molecular level are highlighted.

Conventional non-carbon electrodes are typically formed with a substrate/current collector, which will decrease the practical capacity. Here, we propose an integrated porous electrode made of LaNiO3 that does not require a substrate/current collector. The porous structure allows the formation of nanosized pores on the walls of microsized pores, which facilitates the transport of both oxygen and lithium ions. Importantly, all the surfaces of the porous structure are catalytically active for electrochemical reactions. Experimental results show that the adoption of the electrode in the battery enables a capacity of 1.064 mAhcm(-2) at a current density of 0.05 mAcm(-2). Furthermore, it is demonstrated that the battery can be cycled for at least 25 cycles at a fixed capacity of 0.3 mAhcm(-2), and the electrode shows no degradation after the cycles.									14	1	0	0	0	0	14			2194-4288	2194-4296		WOS:000364325800003

Herein, Se-doped NiCoP with hierarchical nanoarray structures directly grown on carbon cloth (Se-NiCoP/CC) was prepared by hydrothermal reaction and phosphorization/selenization process. The experimental results reveal that Se doping could increase the electrochemical active sites and alter the electronic structure of NiCoP. The optimized Se-NiCoP/CC electrode exhibits outstanding HER activity in alkaline electrolyte, which only needs a low overpotential of 79 mV at the current density of 10 mA/cm(2). When serving as anode and cathode electrode simultaneously, the Se-NiCoP/CC electrodes achieve current density of 50 mA/cm(2) at a low voltage of only 1.62 V.

However, a poor metal-semiconductor interaction is often formed, which not only hinders the interfacial charge transfer, but also results in the easy aggregation and shedding of cocatalysts during photocatalytic reactions. Herein, it is demonstrated that the photodeposited ultrafine metals, such as nanosized Au, can be well stabilized on TiO2 nanocrystallines without sintering by employing a sacrificial carbon coating annealing strategy to strengthen the metal-support interaction. Benefiting from the improved interfacial contact between Au and TiO2 for fast charge transfer and the well-preserved size-dependent catalytic behavior of Au nanoparticles toward hydrogen evolution reaction, the annealed Au/TiO2 exhibits a significant enhanced activity toward photocatalytic H-2 production with good durability.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0947-6539	1521-3765		WOS:000840886400001	35894115

JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY LETTERS				4	17			2843	2846		10.1021/jz401425f				SEP 5 2013	2013	Water is an important reservoir species for oxygen in interstellar space and plays a key role in the physics of star formation through cooling by far-infrared emission. While water vapor is present at high abundances in the outflows of protostars, its contribution to the chemical evolution of these regions is a minor one due to its limited low temperature reactivity in the gas-phase. Here, we performed kinetic experiments on the barrierless CH + H2O reaction in a supersonic flow reactor down to 50 K. The measured rate increases rapidly below room temperature, confirming and extending the predictions of previous statistical calculations. The open product channels for this reaction suggest that this process could be an important gas-phase route for formaldehyde formation in protostellar envelopes.									22	0	0	0	1	0	22			1948-7185			WOS:000326127300010

The highly porous property of the same material made itself appropriate for effective oxygen evaluation reaction and hydrogen evolution reaction together with reduced overpotential and Tafel slope.

The process starts by feeding preheated air to oil shale to initiate a topochemical reaction and the onset of self-pyrolysis. As the temperature in the virgin oil shale increases (to 250-300 degrees C), the hot air can be replaced by ambient-temperature air, allowing heat to be released by internal topochemical reactions to complete the pyrolysis. The propagation of fronts formed in this process, the temperature evolution, and the reaction mechanism of oil shale pyrolysis in porous media are discussed and compared with those in a traditional oxygen-free process. The results show that the self-pyrolysis of oil shale can be achieved with the proposed method without any need for external heat. The results also verify that fractured oil shale may be more suitable for underground retorting. Moreover, the gas and liquid products from this method were characterised, and a highly instrumented experimental device designed specifically for this process is described. This study can serve as a reference for new ideas on oil shale in situ pyrolysis processes.									34	2	0	0	4	0	36			2045-2322			WOS:000348903900005	25656294

The COR is thermodynamically possible above the C/CO2 standard potential, but its rate becomes significantly important only at high overpotential (e. g. PEMFC cathode potential). Herein, using on-line differential electrochemical mass spectrometry, we show that oxygen-containing carbon surface groups present on high-surface aera carbon, Vulcan XC72 or reinforced graphite are oxidized at PEMFC anode-relevant potential (E=0.1 V vs. the reversible hydrogen electrode, RHE), but not at E=0.4 V vs. RHE. We rationalized our findings by considering a Pt-catalysed decarboxylation mechanism in which Pt nanoparticles provide adsorbed hydrogen species to the oxygen-containing carbon surface groups, eventually leading to evolution of carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide. These results shed fundamental light on an unexpected degradation mechanism and facilitate the understanding of the long-term stability of PEMFC anode nanocatalysts.									24	0	0	0	0	0	24			1439-4235	1439-7641		WOS:000474993900001	31237394

Abundances and element production								ASTRONOMY & ASTROPHYSICS				456	2			451	466		10.1051/0004-6361:20053063				SEP 2006	2006	Context. We present the second part of an optical spectroscopic study of planetary nebulae in the LMC and SMC. The first paper, Leisy & Dennefeld (1996, A&AS, 116, 96), discussed the CNO cycle for those objects where C abundances were available.Aims. In this paper we concentrate more on other elemental abundances (such as O, Ne, S, Ar) and their implications for the evolution of the progenitor stars.Methods. We use a much larger sample of 183 objects, of which 65 are our own observations, where the abundances have been re-derived in a homogeneous way. For 156 of them, the quality of data is considered to be satisfactory for further analysis.Results. We confirm the difficulty of separating type I and non-type-I objects in the classical He-N/ O diagram, as found in Paper I, a problem reinforced by the variety of initial compositions for the progenitor stars. We observed oxygen variations, either depletion via the ON cycle in the more massive progenitor stars, or oxygen production in other objects. Neon production also appears to be present. These enrichments seem to be explained best by recent models, some including overshooting, where fresh material from the core or from burning shells is brought to the surface by the 3rd dredge-up. All the effects appear stronger in the SMC, suggesting a higher efficiency in a low metallicity environment, either because the reaction itself is more efficient or because the increment is more visible when superposed on a low initial quantity.Conclusions. Neither oxygen nor neon can therefore be used to derive the initial composition of the progenitor star: other elements not affected by processing such as sulfur, argon or, if observed, chlorine, have to be preferred for this purpose. Some objects with very low initial abundances are detected, but on average, the spatial distribution of PNe abundances is consistent with the history of star formation (SF) as derived from field stars in both Clouds.									89	0	0	0	0	4	90			0004-6361	1432-0746		WOS:000240242400006

Herein we report the synthesis of orthorhombic stacked WO3 center dot H2O square nanoplates by mixing WCl6 (0.025 M) in ethanol at room temperature via a precipitation method. On the other hand, hierarchical urchin-like W18O49 nanostructures composed of nanowires were synthesized from the preceding solution within 10 min through a microwave-assisted route. The morphology evolution from nanoplates to nanowires proceeds through a dissolution and recrystallization mechanism, as demonstrated in detail by varying the reaction duration and temperature. The as synthesized WO3 center dot H2O nanoplates and W18O49 nanowires were employed for the photocatalytic degradation of rhodamine B and photoelectrocatalytic hydrogen generation through water splitting in a neutral medium. Furthermore, the as-synthesized W18O49 nanostructures are employed as electrocatalysts for hydrogen evolution reaction in both acidic and neutral electrolytes. The enhanced electrocatalytic and photocatalytic activity of W18O49 nanostructures are attributed to their larger surface area, oxygen vacancies, and faster charge transport properties. This work demonstrates a greener and simpler way to synthesize a promising defect-rich material (W18O49) in a short duration and its potential in electrocatalytic and photoelectrocatalytic hydrogen generation, and for degradation of pollutant.									40	1	0	0	2	0	40			1932-7447	1932-7455		WOS:000425571100001

Herein, an electrochemical activation method is proposed to reconstruct the surface of a Cu-Fe3O4 catalyst. Following a "dissolution-redeposition" path, the defective FeOOH is formed under potential stimulation on the surface of the Cu-Fe3O4 precursor during the electrochemical activation process. This Cu-FeOOH/Fe3O4 catalyst exhibits excellent stability as well as extremely low overpotential toward the alkaline HER (e.g., 129 and 285 mV at the large current densities of -100 and 500 mA cm(-2), respectively), much superior to the Pt/C catalyst. The experimental and density functional theory calculation results demonstrate that the Cu-FeOOH/Fe3O4 catalyst has abundant oxygen vacancies, featuring optimized surface chemical composition and electronic structure for improving the active sites and intrinsic activity. Introducing defective FeOOH on the surface of a Cu-Fe3O4 catalyst by means of an electrochemical activation method decreases the energy barrier of both H2O dissociation and H-2 generation. Such a surface self-reconstruction strategy provides a new avenue toward the production of efficient non-noble metal catalysts for the HER.									10	0	0	0	0	0	10			1614-6832	1614-6840		WOS:000768033400001

The dynamic brownmillerite structure formation and evolution processes yield distinctively different optical and electronic properties, owing to the difference in both the oxygen stoichiometry and the OVC configuration in the resultant films. With the established recipe, we generated insulating SrFeO2.5 with vertically aligned OVCs and metallic SrFeO3 standards so that the other intermediate states can be directly compared and understood. Our results offer further insight into the phase stability and oxygen-diffusion mechanisms, which is important for the predictive synthesis of novel functional materials.									15	0	0	0	0	0	15			0003-6951	1077-3118		WOS:000471696100028

In this approach, a carboxyl-containing ligand is employed as a coordination agent to retard the hydrolysis and condensation rates of the precursors. The ligands interact with the PEO chains of P123 via hydrogen bonds, which cooperatively ensures the controllable co-assembly of template micelles and the metal source during solvent evaporation. The X-ray diffraction, transmission electron microscopy, and nitrogen sorption results show that the obtained mesoporous metal oxides are constructed from numerous highly crystalline nanoparticles and possess close-packed mesostructures with uniform pore size distributions. A series of mesoporous transition metal oxides (Co3O4, Mn2O3, Fe3O4, NiO, CuO, ZnO, and Cr2O3) and multi-metal oxide composite materials (Co3O4/Fe3O4, Co3O4/NiO, and Fe3O4/NiO) were successfully synthesized. By employing the crystalline Co3O4/Fe3O4 composites as electrocatalysts, high catalytic activity can be achieved during the oxygen evolution reaction. A low overpotential of 322 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) is exhibited, which shows that this approach has great significance not only in synthesis but also in electrocatalysis.									23	2	0	0	4	0	24			1884-4049	1884-4057		WOS:000447955800002

This method was also used to manipulate the formation of nanocomposite, NiPd on Ni(OH)(2) support by controlling the extent of galvanic replacement of Ni by Pd. The bimetallic NiPd nanoparticles supported on Ni(OH)(2) prepared by galvanic reaction showed better electrocatalytic activity for methanol oxidation than commercial Pd/C. This approach can be extended to synthesize various nickel containing bimetallic nanoparticles essential for different catalysis.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			0254-0584	1879-3312		WOS:000449904400041

The dominant product of the reaction above 600 K is CO CO, is only produced at much lower temperatures where the lifetime of adsorbed CO is significant. The segregation from the bulk Only Occurs at a measurable rate at >750 K, while loss of carbon into the bulk call occur at much lower temperatures. The reaction of carbon at high temperatures shows two regimes: (i) a non steady-state evolution of CO due to the clean-off of surface carbon already present on the surface, followed by (ii) a near steady-state reaction due to the continuous diffusion of carbon to the surface.									16	0	0	0	0	0	16			1932-7447			WOS:000275708600041

Linear relationship was found between OER and Phi(PS2) in control cell suspension within irradiance range of 0 - 500 mu mol m(-2) s(-1). Under osmotic stress, OER and Phi(PS2) were significantly reduced. Relation between OER and Phi(PS2) was curvilinear due to strong osmotically-induced inhibition of OER at high irradiance. The highest used irradiance (500 mu mol m(-2) s(-1)) was photoinhibitory for osmotically-stressed T. erici because non-photochemical quenching (NPQ) increased substantially. Energy-dependent quenching represented major part of NPQ increase. Osmotic stress led also to the reduction of capacity of photochemical processes in PS 2 (F-V/F-M) and increase in F-0/F-M. These changes indicated negative effects of osmoticum on structure and function of photosynthetic apparatus.									10	0	0	0	9	1	11			0006-3134			WOS:000234598000016

However, functionalized covalent organic frameworks still need to be further explored. Herein, a quinone-based COF(2, 6-diaminoanthraquinone-COF , DAAQ-COF) was synthesized by using anthraquinone as building blocks, and characterized by powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD ) , nitrogen adsorption-desorption analysis, Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectrometry and thermogravimetry analysis (TGA ) etc. It is showed that the synthesized DAAQ-COF has high crystallinity and specific surface area (577 m(2) /g). Furthermore , quinone-functionalized metal-free DAAQ-COF exhibits effective oxygen evolution reduction(OER) , with a overpotential of 389 mV at 10 mA/cm(2) and a Tafel slope of 135 mV/dec. The introduced quinone group effectively changes the electronic structure and chemical properties of the COF framework, as well as the high crystallinity and specific surface area of the COF material itself, which allows the reactant more efficiently accessible to the active sites for better OER performance. These results show that the rational design of functionalized COFs can promote the development of their broader application prospects in OER.									5	4	0	0	0	0	5			0251-0790			WOS:000563827400024

This work presents a systematic exploratory analysis of first-row transition-metal phthalocyanines as solution-state redox mediators for lithium-oxygen batteries. Our findings, based on experiment and theory, convincingly demonstrate that d(5) (Mn), d(7) (Co), and d(8) (Ni) configurations function better compared to d(6) (Fe) and d(9) (Cu) in redox mediation of the discharge step. The d(10) configuration (Zn) and non-d analogues (Mg) do not show any redox mediation because of the inability of binding with oxygen. The solution-state discharge product, transition-metal bound Li2O2, undergoes dissociation and oxidation in the charging step of the battery, thus confirming a bifunctional redox mediation. Apart from the reaction pathways predicted based on thermodynamic considerations, density functional theory calculations also reveal interesting effects of electrochemical perturbation on the redox mediation mechanisms and the role of the transition-metal center.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000812525200001	35658407

The analysis is based on understanding variations in the free energy of intermediates and mapping out the potential at which different elementary steps are exergonic as a measure of the catalytic activity. We study different surface structures and introduce a simple model for including the effect of adsorbate-adsorbate interactions. We find that high coverages of CO under typical reaction conditions for the more reactive transition metals affect the catalytic activity towards the CO2 reduction reaction, but the ordering of metal activities is not changed. For the hydrogen evolution reaction, a high CO coverage shifts the maximum activity towards more reactive metals than Pt.									289	4	0	0	20	0	286			1463-9076	1463-9084		WOS:000332393200032	24468980

The wetting behavior of carbon (graphite) under different conditions is observed and analyzed. Direct observation and the time evolution of open circuit potentials (OCP) measured in this work suggest that the wetting phenomena are driven not only by capillary forces but also by the electrochemistry of the reverse Boudouard reaction. A semi-quantitative model is proposed to explain the wetting dynamics of carbon. It shows that the progress of wetting is determined primarily by the production of CO at the carbon surface due to the reverse Boudouard reaction, and the OCP is therefore determined by the rate of the reverse Boudouard reaction as well as the mass transfer limitation of CO removal from the electrode. Consequently, the OCP is a function of operating temperature, ambient gas composition, and the immersed length of carbon electrode. (C) 2012 The Electrochemical Society.

As a result, nanostructured electrodes with binder-free designs have abundant advantages that provide superior electrocatalytic performance; these include more exposed active sites, large surface area, strong adhesion to substrates, facile charge transfer, high conductivity, high intrinsic catalytic activity, and fine-tuning of its electronic nature through nanostructure modification. Notably, the interface chemistry of an electrocatalyst plays a significant role in their optimized electrocatalytic activity and stability. This review provides an overview of recent progress in nano- and microstructured catalysts, such as one, two, and 3D catalysts as binder-free electrodes for electrocatalytic water splitting via the hydrogen evolution reaction and oxygen evolution reaction, and beyond. Furthermore, this review focuses on the current challenges and synthesis strategies of binder-free electrodes, with a focus on the impact of nanostructure on their functional property relationships and enhanced bifunctional electrocatalytic performance. Finally, an outlook for their future advances in energy conversion and storage is provided.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			1614-6832	1614-6840		WOS:000789172500001

Herein, we presented a bifunctional Ni@NCNTs/NF-L as both photothermal conversion layer integrated with thermoelectric generator (TE) and efficient hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) electrocatalyst to reducing the potential, realizing the integration system for overall water splitting. The Ni nanoparticles embedded into N-doped carbon nanotubes (Ni@NCNTs/NF-L) with various patterns are prepared by controllable laser processing and gas-solid calcination reaction. Furthermore, iron nickel oxides nanoparticles on NiFe alloys foil (NiFe-L) are obtained by laser ablation, which are applied for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrode to establish two electrode electrolyzer of (-) Ni@NCNTs/NF-L/TE // NiFe-L (+) for overall water splitting. Integrating with one TE, the voltage of water splitting at the current-density of 50 mA cm(-2) reduced from 1.947 V to 1.213 V under the standard AM 1.5 G illumination. The integrated thermoelectric device plays a doubtless role to realize solar energy driving overall water splitting with integration and patterning fabrication in large-scale.									20	2	0	0	3	0	22			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000600017200005

Herein, we report the synthesis of ruthenium (Ru) nanocrystal-decorated vertically aligned graphene nanosheets (VGNS) grown on nickel (Ni) foam. As an effective binder-free cathode catalyst for Li-O-2 batteries, the Ru-decorated VGNS@Ni foam can significantly reduce the charge overpotential via the effects on the OER and achieve high specific capacity, leading to an enhanced electrochemical performance. The Ru-decorated VGNS@Ni foam electrode has demonstrated low charge overpotential of similar to 0.45 V and high reversible capacity of 23 864 mAh g(-1) at the current density of 200 mA g(-1), which can be maintained for 50 cycles under full charge and discharge testing condition in the voltage range of 2.0-4.2 V. Furthermore, Ru nanocrystal decorated VGNS@Ni foam can be cycled for more than 200 cycles with a low overpotential of 0.23 V under the capacity curtained to be 1000 mAh g(-1) at a current density of 200 mA g-1. Ru-decorated VGNS@Ni foam electrodes have also achieved excellent high rate and long cyclability performance. This superior electrochemical performance should be ascribed to the unique three-dimensional porous nanoarchitecture of the VGNS@Ni foam electrodes, which provide sufficient pores for the diffusion of oxygen and storage of the discharge product (Li2O2), and the effective catalytic effect of Ru nanocrystals on the OER, respectively. Ex situ field emission scanning electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, Raman and Fourier transform infrared measurements revealed that Ru-decorated VGNS@Ni foam can effectively decompose the discharge product Li2O2, facilitate the OER and lead to a high round-trip efficiency. Therefore, Ru-decorated VGNS@Ni foam is a promising cathode catalyst for rechargeable Li-O-2 batteries with low charge overpotential, long cycle life and high specific capacity.									40	1	0	0	2	0	39			1884-4049	1884-4057		WOS:000383414800004

However, the OER activities of thermodynamically stable rutile iridium oxide (r-IrO2) and rutile iridium oxide (r-RuO2), normalized to catalyst mass or true surface area are not well-defined. Here we report a synthesis of r-IrO2 and r-RuO2 nanoparticles (NPs) of similar to 6 nm, and examine their OER activities in acid and alkaline solutions. Both r-IrO2 and r-RuO2 NPs were highly active for OER, with r-RuO2 exhibiting up to 10 A/g(oxide) at 1.48 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode. When comparing the two, r-RuO2 NPs were found to have slightly higher intrinsic and mass OER activities than r-IrO2 in both acid and basic solutions. Interestingly, these oxide NPs showed higher stability under OER conditions than commercial Ru/C and Ir/C catalysts. Our study shows that these r-RuO2 and r-IrO2 NPs can serve as a benchmark in the development of active OER catalysts for electrolyzers, metal-air batteries, and photoelectrochemical water splitting applications.									2442	97	0	0	106	1	2465			1948-7185			WOS:000299860200023	26285858

The surface oxygen vacancy defects disrupt the periodicity of the crystal surface and weaken the crystallinity of TaON particles, resulting in a crystalline core and an amorphous shell structure. Introduction of oxygen vacancy plays a pivotal role in regulating the band structure and charge kinetic behaviors of TaON. It renders not only the appearance of defect band level in the forbidden band, which allows drastically broadened and enhanced light absorption of TaON particles, but also the formation of the disorder-order TaON homojunction, which increases the concentration of photogenerated carriers, inhibits the recombination of photogenerated charge and promotes effective surface photocatalytic reaction, thus resulting in significantly improved photocatalytic hydrogen production activity of TaON photocatalyst. The aluminothermic reduction temperature for optimum photocatalytic activity of TaON was 400 degrees C, giving a hydrogen production activity of 25 mu mol g(-1) h(-1), about twice as pure TaON under visible light. This work could shed light on exploring oxygen vacancy-activated photocatalytic materials with great potential for solar-energy conversion.									7	0	0	0	1	0	7			0022-2461	1573-4803		WOS:000621294400011

However, current regulation strategies inevitably involve ambiguous entanglement of crystals, electrons, and spin degrees of freedom. Here, we developed a spin-state regulation method to optimize oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity by lattice orientation control of LaCoO3 epitaxial films. The different lattice-oriented LaCoO3 films bring different degrees of distortion of the CoO6 octahedron, successfully inducing a spin-state transition of cobalt from a low spin state (LS t(2g)(6) e(g)(0)) to an intermediate spin state (IS t(2g)(5) e(g)(1)). X-ray absorption spectroscopy of Co L-edge and O K-edge provides experimental support of spin-state transition in different lattice-oriented LaCoO3 films. As expected, LaCoO3 (100) film possesses optimal e(g) electron filling, lower adsorption free energy, and higher conductivity, exhibiting better OER performance than the other two films. Our findings demonstrate that electronic state regulation will be a new avenue for the rational design of high-activity perovskite electrocatalysts.									148	5	0	0	14	0	151			2451-9294			WOS:000416368000009

The LMO reacts with organic molecules in the vacuum to form a high surface concentration of Li 2CO3 (approximate to 50% C) during initial charging to 4.05 V. Charging to higher potentials reduces the overall Li 2CO3 concentration (approximate to 15% C). Discharging to 3.0 V increases the Li2COs concentration (approximate to 30% C) and over discharging to 0.1 V again reduces its concentration (approximate to 15% C). This behavior is reproducible over 5 cycles. The model geometry utilized suggests that oxygen from LMO can participate in redox of carbon, where LMO contributes oxygen to form the carbonate in the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI). Similar results were obtained from samples cycled ex situ, suggesting that the model in situ geometry provides reasonably representative information about surface chemistry evolution. Carbon redox at LMO and the inherent voltage instability of the Li 2CO3 likely contributes significantly to its capacity fade.									26	1	0	0	1	0	27			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000412717600069	28901735

To overcome this problem, self-supported fluorine-modified 2D ultrathin nickel hydroxide (F-Ni(OH)(2)) nanosheets (NSs) for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and urea oxidation reaction (UOR) are prepared with a scalable and ascendant one-step synthesis route. The enhanced redox activity, electrical conductivity and a great number of exposed active sites of the heterogeneous catalysts improve charge migration for the electrocatalytic reactions. The density of states of the d orbitals of the Ni atoms significantly increases near the Fermi level, thereby indicating that the Ni atoms near the F-dopants promote electrical conduction in the Ni(OH)(2) monolayer. The F-Ni(OH)(2) electrocatalyst exhibits notable OER and UOR activity with onset potentials of 1.43 and 1.16 V versus RHE, respectively required to reach 10 mA cm(-2), which are comparable to those of commercial noble-metal-based electrocatalysts. With RuCo-OH nanospheres, the settled F-Ni(OH)(2)||RuCo-OH cell requires merely 1.55 and 1.37 V to reach 10 mA cm(-2) with superb durability for 24 h in overall water and urea electrolysis, respectively. Overall, high-quality, and efficient noble-metal-free electrocatalysts for overall water and urea electrolysis can be prepared with a simple, scalable, and reproducible preparation method.									8	0	0	0	0	0	8			1613-6810	1613-6829		WOS:000728574800001	34889512

These films were crystallized upon heating in vacuum at an effective heating rate of 0.00847 degrees C/s, while the evolution of the structure was observed by in situ X-ray diffraction measurements. Fast crystallization of the films is observed in the temperature ranges 165-210 degrees C and 185-230 degrees C for the In2O3 and ITO films, respectively. The crystallization kinetics is described by a reaction equation, with activation energies of 2.31 +/- 0.06 eV and 2.41 eV and order of reactions of 0.75 +/- 0.07 and 0.75 for the In2O3 and ITO films, respectively. The structures of the films observed here during heating are compared with those obtained upon film growth at different temperatures. The resistivity of the films depends on the evolution of the structure, the oxygen content and the activation of tin dopants in the films. A low resistivity of 5.5 x 10(-4) Omega cm was obtained for the In2O3 and ITO films at room temperature, after annealing to 250 degrees C the resistivity of the ITO film reduces to 1.2 x 10(-4) Omega cm.

They are formed in different types of cells and have been found in fish, amphibians, reptiles and mammals. Two types of IFN have been found in ray-finned fish (Superclass: Osteichthyes, Class: Actinopterygii) so far, i.e. IFN type I (IFN I) and IFN type II (IFN II), while the presence of IFN type III (IFN III), which is found in phylogenetically older cartilaginous fishes, was not confirmed in this taxonomic group of vertebrates. Currently, type I IFN in Actinopterygii is divided into three groups, I, II and III, within which there are subgroups. These cytokines in these animals show primarily antiviral activity through the use of a signalling pathway JAK-STAT (Janus kinases - Signal transducer and activator of transcription) and the ability to induce ISG (IFN-stimulated genes) expression, which contain ISRE complexes (IFN-stimulated response elements). On the other hand, in Perciformes and Cyprinidae, it was found that type I/I interferons also participate in the antimicrobial response, inter alia, by inducing the expression of the inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and influencing the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in cells carrying out the phagocytosis process.									4	1	0	0	2	0	5			1050-4648	1095-9947		WOS:000615911500004	33387659

Germane to our effort in this field, we report easily synthesizable and very cost-effective isoperthiocyanic acid (IPA) molecular complexes as electrocatalysts for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) under acidic and alkaline conditions. The Pd(II)IPA, Co(II)IPA, and Ni(II)IPA complexes were synthesized and were evaluated for HER and OER applications. These complexes when embedded onto graphitized carbon cloth (GrCC) exhibited a significant enhancement in the HER activity in contrast to their pristine counterparts. The hybrid electrocatalyst Pd(II)IPA among the three showed an extremely low overpotential of 94.1 mV to achieve a current density of 10 mA cm(-2), while Co(II)IPA and Ni(II)IPA complexes showed overpotentials of 367 and 394 mV, respectively, to achieve a current density of 10 mA cm(-2). These complexes on carbon cloth showed decreased charge transfer resistance compared to that of pristine metal complexes. The enhanced catalytic activity of the complexes on carbon cloth can be attributed to the porous and conducting nature of the graphitized carbon cloth. For OER activity, the Pd(II)IPA complex showed an excellent performance with an overpotential value of 210 mV, while Co(II)IPA and Ni(II)IPA exhibited overpotentials of 400 and 270 mV, respectively, to drive a current density of 10 mA cm(-2 )in 0.1 M KOH. This work further widens the scope and application of molecular complexes in combination with an excellent carbon support for renewable energy storage applications.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2470-1343			WOS:000852328100001	36120071

Iron ions could be incorporated into the CeO2 lattice to form a solid solution after calcination at low temperatures, but such solid solution was unstable under high-temperature thermal treatments. High-temperature (a parts per thousand yen800 A degrees C) calcination resulted in the appearance of exposed Fe2O3 phases on the surface of the solid solution, and this structural evolution finally affected the reduction behavior. The Fe3+ reduction from the Ce-Fe oxide solid solution was easier than the bulk Fe2O3 particles, while the small Fe2O3 particles in close contact with CeO2 could enhance the reducibility of cerium oxides. The strong interaction between the exposed small Fe2O3 particles and the solid solution made the Ce-Fe mixed oxides possess good reduction stability and high oxygen storage capacity (OSC) even after repeated redox treatments. Such interactions were absent toward the physically mixed sample. An unusual enhancement on the reducibility of Ce-Fe mixed oxides was observed after a successive redox treatment. Large oxygen evolution appeared at around 600 A degrees C for the recycled samples, and the OSC rose to 1.31 mmol-O-2/g after six redox cycles. The XRD, Raman, and TEM analyses revealed that the material structure of the mixed oxides was stabilized to have an inter-region between the Fe2O3 particles and the solid solution after the redox treatment. It was concluded that such microstructural evolutions of composite particle from solid solution under redox conditions brought beneficial property to the OSC of the Ce-Fe mixed oxides.									10	2	0	0	0	0	12			0022-2461			WOS:000321271100004

Herein, an environmentally friendly dry chemical route based on ion beam technology is designed to construct the heterostructural CuO/Cu/WO3-x/WO3/W electrocatalysts. Through H+ beam bombardment, the oxygen vacancies in the tungsten oxide are created, and the Cu species are deposited simultaneously on the surface oxidized W mesh. This fabrication leads to a significant elevation of HER performance for WO(3 )based electrocatalysts. The self-supported CuO/Cu/WO3-x/WO3/W electrode exhibits an overpotential of 127 mV at -10 mA cm(-2) in 0.5 M H2SO4 aqueous solution, which is much better than those of the other samples without the WO3-x layer or the deposited Cu species. The H+ bombardment induced oxygen vacancies enhance the conductivity of the tungsten oxide via narrowing its bandgap, as well as provide large amounts of unsaturated W atoms that could serve as active sites. The Cu species play a role of electron mobility promoter for further enhancing the HER activity. This strategy offers a facile route for the construction of transition metal based heterostructural electrocatalysts.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000776698300003

Most commonly, the framework of the thermodynamic overpotential, eta(TD), is applied to study activity trends of electrodes in a class of materials. The concept of eta(TD), however, relies on the evaluation of a single free-energy change at the equilibrium potential of the reaction, which may explain that the notion of eta(TD) does not always capture activity trends correctly. To compensate this shortcoming, the electrochemical-step symmetry index (ESSI) was introduced, which accounts for all free-energy changes at the equilibrium potential among the mechanistic description. Yet, both eta(TD) and the ESSI do not consider overpotential and kinetic effects in the analysis, motivating the introduction of an overpotential-dependent activity descriptor for multiple-electron processes, G(max(eta)). In this manuscript, these three descriptors to approximate electrocatalytic activity in a heuristic fashion are compared, elaborating that the assessment of activity by a single free-energy change is too simplistic.

Here, we report a quaternary B/P-codoped transition metal Co-Mo hybrid as an efficient alternative catalyst for overall water splitting. The Co-Mo-B-P/CF dual nanowafers were deposited on a copper foam by double-pulse electrodeposition, which is favorable for achieving a nanocrystalline structure. The Co-Mo-B-P/CF catalyst shows a high catalytic activity along with good long-term stability in 1.0 M KOH solutions for both the hydrogen and oxygen evolution reactions, requiring 48 and 275 mV to reach 10 mA cm(-2), respectively. The synergetic effect between Co-Mo and doped B and P elements is mainly attributed to the excellent bifunctional catalysis performance, while the dual-nanowafer structure endows Co-Mo-B-P with numerous catalytical active sites enhancing the utilization efficiency of atoms. Moreover, the catalytic capability of Co-Mo-B-P/CF as a bifunctional electrocatalyst for the overall water splitting is proved, with the current density of 10 mA cm(-2) accomplished at 1.59 V. After the stability test for overall water splitting at 1.59 V for 24 h, the activity almost remains unchanged. The features of excellent electrocatalytic activity, simple preparation, and inexpensive raw materials for Co-Mo-B-P/CF as a bifunctional catalyst hold great potentials for overall water splitting.									16	0	0	0	0	0	16			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000648552500044	33900745

Herein, a cobalt phos-phate (Co-Pi) and reduced graphene oxide (GR) modified CdS photocatalyst is synthesized and utilized for photocatalytic selective conversion of 4-methoxythiophenol (4-MTP) to bis(4-methoxyphenyl) disulfide (4-MPD) coupled with H2 evolution. In this dual-cocatalyst system, Co-Pi effectively captures and releases the holes from CdS through the chemical state change of Co to accelerate the surface thiols oxidation reaction, while GR is used as an electron collector and an active site for the proton reduction to H2. Consequently, the bifunctional GR-CdS-(Co-Pi) photocatalyst demonstrates significantly higher photoactivity than blank CdS. This work affords a new paradigm of incorporating dual-cocatalysts with semiconductor photocatalysts to efficiently take advantage of the photoinduced electrons and holes for photoredox-catalyzed cooperative coupling of organic transformation and H2 evolution.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000872117200003		
J	Deng, Yuqiong; Fu, Xionghui; Zhang, Yuanming; Zhu, Yi; Wei, Yongge								Efficient Oxygen Evolution Reaction on Polyethylene Glycol-Modified BiVO4 Photoanode by Speeding up Proton Transfer								SMALL				18	30					2201410	10.1002/smll.202201410		JUN 2022		JUL 2022	2022	The rate-determining step of the oxygen evolution reaction based on a semiconductor photoanode is the formation of the O-O bond. Herein, polyethylene glycol (PEG)-modified BiVO4 photoanodes are reported, in which protons can be transferred quickly due to the high proton conductivity of PEG, resulting in the acceleration of the O-O bond formation rate. These are fully demonstrated by different kinetic isotope effect values. Moreover, the open-circuit voltage (U-oc) further illustrates that PEG passivates the surface states and surface charge recombination is reduced. The composite photoanode can achieve a maximum photocurrent density of 3.64 mA cm(-2) at 1.23 V compared to 1.04 mA cm(-2) for pure BiVO4, and an onset potential of 170 mV, which is a 230 mV negative shift compared to pure BiVO4. This work provides a new strategy to accelerate water oxidation kinetics for photoanodes by speeding up the transfer of the proton and the O-O bond formation rate.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1613-6810	1613-6829		WOS:000811531100001	35708149

Herein, the in situ scaffolding formation of 3D Prussian blue analogues (PBAs) on a variety of 2D or 1D metal hydroxides/oxides to fabricate hierarchical nanostructures is first demonstrated. Typically, cobalt hydroxide or oxide nanoarrays are used as the precursor and structural oriented template for the subsequent growth of 3D PBA nanocubes. The mechanism study reveals that the interfacial scaffolding process can be reversibly controlled via the in situ ion exchange process with adjusting coordination ions. Thus, the facile, versatile strategy can extend to successfully fabricate a variety of hierarchical PBA-based nanostructures including on cobalt fluoride hydroxide, copper hydroxide, monometal or bimetal nickel-cobalt hydroxides, cobalt oxide, and manganese oxide nanosheets with structural tailor-ability and chemical diversity. More interestingly, the metal nitride derivatives obtained via controlled calcination process exhibit good electrocatalytic activity for water splitting with low overpotentials, and remarkable durability for 1200 h, thanks to the superior intrinsic activity of bimetal nature and the scrupulous hierarchical structure. This versatile strategy provides a paradigm for rational design of PBA-based functional nanomaterials, which is highly promising in energy conversion, storage, and electrocatalytic fields.									90	5	0	0	4	0	91			1614-6832	1614-6840		WOS:000459624100002

The amorphous nickel carbonate particles can be prepared at a temperature as low as 60 degrees C by an evaporation-induced precipitation (EIP) method. The products feature hierarchical pore structures. The mass-normalized activity of the catalysts, measured at an overpotential of 0.35V, was 55.1Ag(-1), with a Tafel slope of only 60mVdec(-1). This catalytic activity is superior to the performance of crystalline NiOx particles and -Ni(OH)(2) particles, and compares favorably to state-of-the-art RuO2 catalysts. The activity of the amorphous nickel carbonate is remarkably stable during a 10000s chronoamperometry test. Further optimization of synthesis parameters reveals that the amorphous structure can be tuned by adjusting the H2O/Ni ratio in the precursor mixture. These results suggest the potential application of easily prepared hierarchical basic nickel carbonate particles as cheap and robust OER catalysts with high activity.									8	1	0	0	0	0	8			1864-5631	1864-564X		WOS:000357619000005	26097200

The CoP microtubes show superior HER performance in a wide pH range with low overpotentials of 91,101 and 113 mV at 10 mA cm-2 in 0.5 M H2SO4, 1 M KOH and 1 M PBS, respectively. Additionally, it also depicts superior OER performance with an overpotential of 300 mV at 10 mA cm-2, which is lower than reported precious metal oxides. The improved electrocatalytic performance of tubular CoP is likely attributed to the porous tube-like structural features, which not only afford rich exposed active sites, but also accelerate the charge or mass transfer efficiency, and thus efficiently promote the HER performance. The synthesis of tubular CoP confirms the importance of morphology features and provides a new insight to rationally design and synthesize highly effective nonnoble metal phosphide-based pH-universal electrocatalysts for HER.

One of the most promising strategies to produce hydrogen is to split water using renewable energy such as solar radiation. The abundance of water and solar energy enables the potential of scaling-up of this new technology, if suitable electrocatalysts and solar cells are developed. In this work, a series of materials made of earth-abundant elements was investigated for hydrogen evolution or oxygen evolution reaction. Among the developed catalysts, MoS2 and NiFe showed the best activities for proton reduction and water oxidation, respectively. These catalysts were further integrated into an alkaline electrolyzer, which delivered a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at a cell voltage of 1.9 V for water splitting. Using two in-series-connected perovskite solar cells (PSCs) as a power source, a remarkable solar-to-hydrogen conversion efficiency of 12.67 % was achieved in an alkaline electrolyzer with a partial current density of 10.3 mA cm(-2) for hydrogen production. The usage of earth-abundant catalysts in this study, together with the employment of low-cost perovskite light absorber, shows the potential of scaling up this type of photovoltaic electrolyzer for sustainable hydrogen production.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			1864-5631	1864-564X		WOS:000746057300001	34962096

Hydrolysis is an important method for high purity, high volume hydrogen production. In order to accelerate the kinetics of hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in alkaline media, it is essential to explore efficient catalysts. In this paper, the nanoscale self-supported Mn-NiS/Mn-Ni3S4 composite catalysts was assembled on nickel foam. Benefiting from the lattice distortion and vacancy defects caused by the doping of Mn elements, the catalysts exposed an increasing number of electrochemical surfaces and effective active sites, showing impressive electrochemical performance with a HER overpotential of only 94.2 mV at 10 mA/cm2 and an OER overpotential of only 253 mV to drive 50 mA/cm(2). Applying as the bifunctional catalysts, the Mn-NiS/Mn-Ni3S4 couple only achieved a low voltage of only 1.52 V to drive 10 mA/cm2. This paper pro-vides new ideas and references for the rational design of high-performance sulfide catalysts with non-precious metal composites.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0016-2361	1873-7153		WOS:000860688800003

Through computational screening, 13 materials were recently predicted as potential water-splitting photocatalysts: Cu3NbS4, CuYS2, SrCu2O2, CuGaO2, Na3BiO4, Sr2PbO4, LaCuOS, LaCuOSe, Na2TeO4, La4O4Se3, Cu2WS4, BaCu2O2, and CuAlO2. Herein, these materials are synthesized, their bandgaps and band alignments are experimentally determined, and their photoelectrocatalytic hydrogen evolution properties are assessed. Using cyclic voltammetry and chopped illumination experiments, 9 of the 13 materials are experimentally found to have bandgaps and band alignments that straddle the potentials required for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), as computationally predicted. During photocatalytic testing, 12 of the materials yield a measurable photocurrent. However, only three are found to be active for the HER, with Cu3NbS4, CuYS2, and Cu2WS4 producing H-2 in amounts comparable to bare TiO2; a benchmark photocatalyst. This study provides experimental validation of computational bandgap and band alignment predictions while also successfully identifying active photocatalysts.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1614-6832	1614-6840		WOS:000842333300001

Herein, integrating the active components of oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) into novel inter-doped ruthenium-nickel oxide [(Ru-Ni)Ox] heterostructure by self-templated strategy is proposed. The (Ru-Ni)Ox electrode exhibits superb HER and OER activities with minimum overpotentials of 14.5 mV and 237.2 mV to afford 10 mA cm-2, respectively. According, a voltage of 1.48 V is required to drive 10 mA cm-2 for overall water-alkali splitting. The combined spectroscopy analysis and theory calculations reveal electronic structure regulation and potential-induced synergy, the modulation of the D-band center optimizes the adsorption energy of H* for enhanced HER on Ru-NiO, and NiO-derived NiOOH favors H2O dissociation for enhanced OER on Ni-RuO2. The successful assembly of a solar-driven alkaline electrolyzer provides more flexibility applications of (Ru-Ni)Ox electrocatalyst.									14	0	0	0	2	0	14			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000696932600002

Herein, we demonstrate a hollow Ru nanostructure (h-RuNP) that is fabricated with an ultrasmall Ru nanoparticle of similar to 1.72 nm and is resistant to oxidation. The construction of h-RuNP was done using preformed Ni nanocrystals as reducing agents in dimethylformamide (DMF) without the need of any inert gas atmosphere (such as N-2) or stabilizing agents. Studies indicate that both the solvent DMF and the ultrasmall Ru nanoparticles help to prevent the surface oxidation of Ru. The as-synthesized h-RuNP possesses robust catalytic activity toward HER in acidic media, which is superior to that of recently reported pure Ru and Ru-based nanocatalysts and close to that of the commercial 20% Pt/C catalyst. The h-RuNP also exhibits exceptional long-term stability under natural ambient conditions (no nitrogen is added to remove oxygen). The enhanced performance of h-RuNP mainly arose from the strong surface oxidation resistance and antiaggregation effect of unsupported ultrasmall Ru nanoparticles.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5				2574-0970		WOS:000692034900098

The electrochemically active surface area was examined by cyclic voltammetry, while the analysis of the activity for the CER was performed by polarization measurements. The stability of the obtained anode coatings was also checked by an accelerated stability test. The anode properties depend on the number of C atoms in the alcohol molecule, as well as on the elapsed time between the preparation of the sols/alcohol mixture and its application onto the titanium support. The addition of alcohol increased the activity of the anodes for the CER, compared to those prepared without the addition, but their stability was smaller.									7	0	0	0	0	0	7			0352-5139			WOS:000172840000010

Herein, we report the design of Ni- and Ru-based electrocatalysts within a wide Ni/Ru ratio range, prepared through a one-step heat treatment of ultra-thin ruthenate nanosheets and NiCl2 6H(2)O and NaH2PO2H2O precursors. At 250 degrees C under an argon flow, a pristine Ru electrode was shown to undergo preferential ruthenate-to-metallic Ru phase transformation, revealing preferable hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) fingerprints. At low Ni/Ru ratios, the interaction between the Ni2+ ions and the negatively charged ruthenate favored the in situ growth of highly dispersed surface Ni-based moieties below 5 nm in diameter. XPS measurements confirmed, however, that these narrow moieties were swiftly oxidized to NiO, whereas larger Ni-based agglomerates at higher Ni/Ru ratios were less prone to oxidation. This size-dependent propensity of Ni2P moieties toward oxidation, reported here for the first time, agrees with the surface oxidation of Ni2P nanoparticles (50-100 nm) to a limited extent. At Ni/Ru = 0.36, the incorporated NiO favored a synergistically superior oxygen evolution reaction (OER) performance and an optimal 1.7-fold activity enhancement at limiting current densities. An antagonistic effect in the HER performance of these hybrid materials was, nonetheless, simultaneously observed and ascribed to the blockage of the active Ru surface. While the performance of these nano-architectures remains a modest addition to the current state-of-the-art of water splitting platforms in alkaline electrolyte media, our results primarily reveal representative bottlenecks in the integration of multiple phases during synthesis steps and the effects of arising between integrated components on the catalytic behavior of resulting hybrids.									20	1	0	0	2	0	20			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000455124900019

Our previous work by using organometallic precatalysts Cp*Ir(pyalk)-OH and Ir(pyalk)(CO)(2) (pyalk = (2-pyridyl)-2-propanolate) suggested a mu-oxo-bridged Ir dimer as the probable resting state, although the structure of the active species remained elusive. During the activation, the ligands Cp* and CO were found to oxidatively degrade into acetic acid or other products, which coordinate to Ir centers and affect the catalytic reaction. Two related dimers bearing two pyalk ligands on each iridium were crystallized for structural analysis. However, preliminary results indicated that these crystallographically characterized dimers are not active catalysts. In this work, we accessed a mixture of dinuclear iridium species from a coordination precursor, Na[Ir(pyalk)Cl-4], and assayed their catalytic activity for oxygen evolution by using NaIO4 as the oxidant. This catalyst showed comparable oxygen-evolution activity to the ones previously reported from organometallic precursors without demanding oxidative activation to remove sacrificial ligands. Future research along this direction is expected to provide insights and design principles toward a well-defined active species.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			0020-1669	1520-510X		WOS:000699833500059	34478282

Compared with pristine g-C3N4, the synergetic effect of nitrogen vacancies combined with a nanocage-like structure endowed it with a broad visible-light-responsive range, more exposed active lateral edges and catalytically active sites, as well as efficient separation of photogenerated carriers. As a consequence, the modified g-C3N4 exhibited prominent photocatalytic performance in water splitting for the hydrogen evolution reaction under visible light illumination. The optimized photocatalyst (DCN-550) showed a maximum photocatalytic H-2 evolution rate of 92.57 mol h(-1), almost 20.3 times higher than that of pristine g-C3N4. Moreover, a possible mechanism for the photocatalytic hydrogen evolution and nanostructure formation process based on the experimental results was proposed. The new growth strategy developed here could inspire similar attempts to modify novel visible-light-driven photocatalysts through nanostructure design.									93	7	0	0	8	0	95			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000463824300021

Herein, we report a novel method to synthesize Ag NPs rapidly in one step, achieving typical particle sizes in the range from 5 to 15 nm. The synthesis steps only involve three chemicals without any reducing agent: AgNO3 as precursor, polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) as stabilizer, and AgCl as photocatalyst. The Ag NPs were supported on carbon and showed excellent performance in thermal catalytic p-nitrophenol reduction and nitrobenzene hydrogenation, and as electrocatalyst for the oxygen reduction reaction.

Herein, tuning of the charge transfer ability and catalytic performance of zeolitic imidazolate framework-derived porous carbon/reduced graphene oxide-coupled CoP composites (CoP@C@rGO) was achieved by incorporating multiple heteroatoms. The combined experimental investigation and density functional theory calculations revealed that the electronic interaction within the composites caused by B, N, and S tri-doped heteroatoms effectively induced interfacial charge transfer, which improved the active site accessibility and reduced the energy barriers of the intermediates. From the synergetic effects of the components, the overall water splitting electrolyzer assembled using the newly prepared B,N,S-CoP@C@rGO catalyst required only 1.50 V to drive a current density of 10 mA cm(-2), which is superior to the commercial Pt/C and IrO2/C couple (1.56 V).									53	1	0	0	4	0	53			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000521513300048

Although tremendous efforts have been made, the fabrication of well-defined hollow nanostructures has been rarely reported due to the limitations of the synthetic methods. Herein, we have proposed a general synthetic strategy for the construction of V-doped CoMx (M = P, S, O) nanoboxes (NBs), where the doped V effectively modifies the electronic structure of CoMx to provide a favorable surface electrochemical environment for the adsorption of reaction intermediates (*O, *OH, and *OOH), leading to a significant enhancement in electrocatalytic performance. More importantly, the hollow nanostructures can expose abundant surface active areas and promote the chemical adsorption of reactants and intermediates, greatly contributing to the promotion of electrocatalytic performance. Impressively, the optimal V-doped CoS2 NBs show excellent electrocatalytic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) performance with an overpotential of only 290 mV at 10 mA cm(-2), along with outstanding overall water-splitting performance. This work supplies pivotal insights for constructing high-performance OER catalysts on the basis of electronic and geometric engineering.									29	2	0	0	1	0	29			0020-1669	1520-510X		WOS:000562989200064	32799494

Here, an efficient electrostatic repulsion and anchor strategy via constructing a CdS@Polydopamine@SnO2-x sandwich structure with numerous oxygen vacancies through a simple chemical bath deposition approach. During the formation process, the CdS nanorods are wrapped by the catechol fragments from polydopamine (PDA) and display an electronegative surface. This strong electrostatic repulsion can effectively repel S2-, thereby effectively preventing S2- from being separated from CdS and being oxidized by holes or oxygen. Furthermore, the PDA employed as an interlayer of the heterojunction sandwich structure can fix the multivalent metal ions, such as Cd2+ and Sn4+ ions on CdS and SnO2-x, which can be used as a bridge for electronic transmission. More importantly, the as-prepared SnO2-x nanocrystals are found to possess a large amount of oxygen vacancies, which can effectively control the electronic structure of the catalyst, enhance the electron enrichment effect, promote the absorption of visible light and change the charge transfer ability. More importantly, the accumulation of CdS@PDA@SnO2-x (411.37 mmol) photocatalytic hydrogen evolution is 34.3 times than pristine CdS (12.0 mmol) within 5 h, and the catalytic activity remains stable after 10 cycles. Photoelectrochemical characterization, Scanning Kelvin Probe (SKP), Finite Difference Time Domain (FDTD) simulations verified the mechanism of enhanced photocatalytic activity. Herein, this work displays a novel structure and mechanism to enhance the stability of sulfide semiconductors, which may further open a new path in the structural control strategy of photocatalysts.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000773065500005

There are many sustainable electrocatalytic processes that might provide the answers to the above-mentioned challenges, such as the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), water splitting, the carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CO2RR), and the nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR). These reactions can enhance the value added by producing hydrogen energy through water splitting or convert useless CO2 and N-2 into fuels and NH3. These electrocatalytic reactions can be driven by high-performance catalysts. Therefore, the exploration of novel electrocatalysts is one of the important electrocatalytic fields. In this paper, we aim to systematically discuss a variety of electrocatalysts used for sustainable processes and to give further insights into their status and associated challenges. We invited many famous research groups to write this roadmap with topics including platinum (Pt) and its alloys for ORR, oxides for ORR, chalcogenides for ORR, carbon-based hollow electrocatalysts for ORR, carbides for ORR, atomically dispersed Fe-N-C catalysts for ORR, metal-free catalysts for ORR, single-atom catalysts (SACs) for ORR, metal boride (MB) electrocatalysts for water splitting, transitional metal carbides (TMCs) for water splitting, transition metal (TM) phosphides for water splitting, oxides for water splitting, sulfides for water splitting, layered double hydroxides for water splitting, carbon-based electrocatalysts for water splitting, Ru-based electrocatalysts for water splitting, metal oxides for CO2RR, metal sulfides for CO2RR, metals for CO2RR, carbon for CO2RR, SACs for CO2RR, heterogeneous molecular catalysts for CO2RR, oxides for NRR, chalcogenides for NRR, C3N4 for NRR, SACs for NRR, etc. Their contributions enabled us to compile this 2020 roadmap on electrocatalysts for green catalytic processes and provide some suggestions for future researchers.									35	1	0	0	2	0	35				2515-7639		WOS:000637354400001

Successful attempting of achieving multi-phase CuBi2O4@CuO@alpha-Bi2O3 nanocomposite electrocatalyst has been confirmed by well-built diffraction peaks obtained through XRD. Phonon vibration modes, oxygen defects and metal-oxygen vibrations present in the nanocomposite has been confirmed by Raman, PL and FTIR studies. The estimation of optical band gap for CuBi2O4@CuO@alpha-Bi2O3 nanocomposite was 1.77 eV. The rice like nanoparticle morphology has been examined by SEM images. The multi-phase formation and growth mechanism achieved by PVP linkaging agent has been discussed. The maximum oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity of CuBi2O4@CuO@alpha-Bi2O3 nanocomposite achieved as 0.14 mA/g with lowest over potential of 135 mV/decade and the excellent stability over 3h with 0.2 mA/g current density. From this report, we have strongly recommended that PVP capping agent is the most suitable surfactant for highly active multiphase nanocomposite electrocatalyst rather than single phase binary metal oxides for electrochemical water splitting application.					63rd DAE Solid State Physics Symposium (DAE-SSPS)63rd DAE Solid State Physics Symposium (DAE-SSPS)	DEC 18-22, 2018DEC 18-22, 2018	Dept Atom Energy; Bhabha Atom Res Ctr; Govt India, Dept Atom Energy, Board Res Nucl SciDept Atom Energy; Bhabha Atom Res Ctr; Govt India, Dept Atom Energy, Board Res Nucl Sci	Guru Jambheshwar Univ Sci & Technol, Hisar, INDIAGuru Jambheshwar Univ Sci & Technol, Hisar, INDIA	1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0094-243X		978-0-7354-1851-6	WOS:000504650100574

The nanoparticle-decorated 2D nanoflake morphology and the intrinsic porosity inherited from the MOF precursor render NiCo(nf)-P a highly efficient bifunctional electrocatalyst toward hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), oxygen evolution reaction (OER), and overall water splitting. In 1.0 M KOH electrolyte solution, NiCo(nf)-P shows low overpotentials of 199/283/317 and 315/378/416 mV at 100/500/1000 mA cm-2 for HER and OER, respectively. For overall water splitting, it only needs low cell voltages of 1.74/1.86/1.94 V to reach 100/500/1000 mA cm-2, with outstanding long-term stability over 30 h. The excellent catalytic performance of NiCo(nf)-P outperforms most of the NiCoPbased electrocatalysts reported so far, indicating its great potential for the overall water splitting application.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2168-0485			WOS:000848556600001

Quantification of Phase Evolution in Pr2NiO4								JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN CERAMIC SOCIETY				99	8			2737	2741		10.1111/jace.14291				AUG 2016	2016	Praseodymium nickelate (Pr2NiO4) is an active oxygen electrode for solid oxide fuel cells, but undergoes phase transition at elevated temperatures (e.g., 750 degrees C). Quantification of this phase evolution in an operating single cell is challenging because of the overlap of X-ray diffraction (XRD) peaks between the cathode and oxide current collector. In this work, we replace the oxide current collector with a gold metal grid, circumventing these challenges by allowing the exposure of the cathode to the X-ray beam, while eliminating peak overlap. Quantification of the phase evolution was performed by a least-squares fitting of the linear combination of XRD standards against the experimental patterns. Energy-dispersive spectroscopy analysis on long-term operated cells showed the absence of reactions between the gold grids and the cathodes. Additionally, the grids exhibited excellent mechanical stability under operating conditions and enabled similar cell performance as an oxide current collector.									17	0	0	0	0	0	17			0002-7820	1551-2916		WOS:000386573200027

PtCo3 nanopartides with polyhedral shapes were synthesized by a hot-injection method. Scanning transmission electron microscopy combined with energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) showed that these nanoparticles demonstrated elemental segregation of platinum to the edges of the polyhedron, forming the basis for a framework nanostructure. The process of preferential oxidative leaching which removed cobalt from the interior of the framework was tracked by EDS and inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy. This evolution procedure left the platinum-rich edges intact to form a Pt3Co nanoframe. This is the first reported synthesis of a platinum-cobalt nanoframe and could have potential applications in catalytic reactions such as oxygen reduction. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Here, we report core-shell structured MXene@carbon (MX@C) nanodot hybrids with high bifunctional activity, where N-doped carbon shells are grown in a heteroepitaxial manner strongly interacting with the MXene core. The resulting MX@C nanodot hybrids show enhanced catalytic activity for electrochemical hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in various pH media from 0 to 14. At pH 14, MX@C achieves the low onset potential of 134 mV at 10 mA/cm(2) and reduced Tafel slope of 32 mV/dec due to the facilitated charge transfer along the recombination reaction. For the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), MX@C nanodots are incorporated onto the surface of molybdenum-doped bismuth vanadate (Mo:BiVO4) as a cocatalyst of the photoanode, thereby achieving 1.5 times higher photocurrent density than pristine Mo:BiVO4 at 1.23 V (vs reversible hydrogen electrode) due to the enhanced light absorption and charge transfer efficiency. The superiority of this hybrid catalyst is demonstrated implementing the solar-assisted overall water splitting cells based on the MX@C cathode and MX@C/Mo:BiVO4 photoanode. These cells show the enhancement of current density from 0.78 to 1.23 mA/cm(2) with long-term durability over 8 h. These results are attributed to the facile surface catalytic kinetics of the chemically and electronically coupled MX@C hybrid at the heterointerface for both OER and HER.									30	2	0	0	3	0	30			1936-0851	1936-086X		WOS:000603308800119	33301316

These results establish MgCoO2 as suitable electrode material in aqueous lithium-ion and sodium-ion supercapacitor devices.

If properly doped, these oxides are relatively good conductors, assuring that ohmic drop in real applications is minimal. Corrosion of dopants, however, will lead to severe performance deterioration. The present work aims to investigate the potential dependent dissolution rates of indium tin oxide (ITO), fluorine doped tin oxide (FTO) and antimony doped tin oxide (ATO) in the broad potential window ranging from -0.6 to 3.2 V-RHE in 0.1 M H2SO4 electrolyte. It is shown that in the cathodic part of the studied potential window all oxides dissolve during the electrochemical reduction of the oxide - cathodic dissolution. In case an oxidation potential is applied to the reduced electrode, metal oxidation is accompanied with additional dissolution - anodic dissolution. Additional dissolution is observed during the oxygen evolution reaction. FTO withstands anodic conditions best, while little and strong dissolution is observed for ATO and ITO, respectively. In discussion of possible corrosion mechanisms, obtained dissolution onset potentials are correlated with existing thermodynamic data.									84	1	0	0	4	0	84			2045-2322			WOS:000404655700001	28676657

The biodegradation rate was evaluated by weight loss of waste and CO2 evolution. The degradation reaction was restricted only by adjusting the environmental temperature while sufficient oxygen and substrates were supplied. Results suggested that the optimum temperature for degradation was 30 degrees -40 degreesC for exploiting biological activity effectively with the lowest use of energy. Bacteria from the environment propagated in the reactor with no inoculum added. The microbial flora changed during the operation time but had no effect on the biodegradation rate.									6	0	0	0	3	0	6			1435-0211			WOS:000168630600013

Ammonium tetrathiomolybdate (ATM), a common laboratory reagent, spontaneously assembles on Au electrodes. Atomic force microscopy, scanning electron microscopy, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy data indicate formation of multiple layers of ATM which are stable over a wide pH range for days. These assemblies can produce hydrogen with very low onset potentials. It shows a turnover rate of 1.4 s(-1) and turnover number >5 X 10(4) in pH 7 at 180 mV overpotential. The pH dependence of the peak potential suggests that the generation of H-2 from water proceeds likely via a ligand based proton coupled electron transfer process which precludes inhibition by O-2. The ATM functionalized Au electrodes are found to efficiently catalyze HER in saline rich, CO saturated, and sulfide rich water sources with minimal inhibition of catalytic activity.									25	1	0	0	2	0	25			0020-1669	1520-510X		WOS:000328668400046	24261567

Herein, a facile and convenient strategy using tris(2,2'-bipyridyl)ruthenium(H) chloride hexahydrate as precursor is developed for synthesizing ultrafine and highly dispersed ruthenium nanoclusters on carbon support. It is discovered that the preadsorption of Ru precursor on carbon substrate and followed by pyrolysis are very crucial for the synthesis of such Ru nanoclusters. Among as-prepared samples, Ru/CN-800 shows the best HER electrocatalytic performance in alkaline solution, which outperforms the benchmark Pt/C and recently reported catalysts. The excellent performance of Ru/CN-800 was presumably attributed to the dominant metallic Ru as well as the ultrasmall Ru nanoclusters with a satisfied dispersion, which provides the massive highly active sites for HER This facile and environmental-friendly pathway for synthesis of ultrasmall Ru nanoclusters with high HER activity shows a promise in practical applications.									44	1	0	0	2	0	44			2168-0485			WOS:000443924100043

Using modular insertion of suitable precursors in the starting solution, it is possible to synthesize different types of graphene-based materials ranging from heteroatom-doped graphene nanoballs to hierarchical nanohybrids made up by nitrogen-doped crumpled graphene nanosacks that wrap finely dispersed MoS2 nanoparticles. These materials are carefully investigated by microscopic (SEM, standard and HR TEM), diffraction (grazing incidence X-ray diffraction (GIXRD)) and spectroscopic (high resolution photoemission, Raman and UV-visible spectroscopy) techniques, evidencing that nitrogen dopants provide anchoring sites for MoS2 nanoparticles, whereas crumpling of graphene sheets drastically limits aggregation. The activity of these materials is tested toward the photoelectrochemical production of hydrogen, obtaining that N-doped graphene/MoS2 nanohybrids are seven times more efficient with respect to single MoS2 because of the formation of local p-n MoS2/N-doped graphene nanojunctions, which allow an efficient charge carrier separation.									54	5	0	0	3	0	55			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000366005600018	26517577

The surface morphology and phase structure of PbO2 electrodes with different pulse frequency were analyzed by scanning electronic microscopy (SEM) and X-ray diffraction (XRD). The results show that the increase of pulse frequency decreases the grain size of PbO2 electrodes and the electrodes become more compact. The linear sweep voltammogram curves show that PbO2 (10 Hz) electrodes possess highest oxygen evolution overpotential among these PbO2 electrodes prepared by pulse electrodeposition. The stability tests show that the service life of PbO2 (10 Hz) electrodes is 2 times longer than that of PbO2 electrode prepared by direct electrodeposition. The electrocatalytic activity of PbO2 electrodes with different pulse frequency was also examined for the electrochemical oxidation of methylene blue (MB) and good fitting was found using the relation for the pseudo-first order reaction. The bulk electrolysis shows that the PbO2 (10 Hz) electrodes exhibit the highest activity for the degradation of MB. (C) 2013 The Electrochemical Society.

Thus, potential environmental reconstructions from disequilibrium compositions in natural carbonates require (i) quantification of KIEs associated with reactions involved in mineral formation, and (ii) a theoretical framework linking physical properties of natural environments to the expression and preservation of these KIEs in carbonates.To constrain KIEs associated with carbonate mineral precipitation reactions, we performed a series of rapid witherite (BaCO3) precipitation experiments over a range of pH (8.7-13.0), temperature (15-40 degrees C) and fractional yield of the dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC; a few percent to quantitative precipitation). Our experiments extend the range of pH and temperature explored in previous studies, and include measurements of both carbon and oxygen isotopes. We developed a dynamic model of the DIC system, with which we simulated the experiments. The model results identify isotopic distillation due to formation of aqueous CO2 and mineral precipitation by either CO32- or HCO3- as the main determinants of the carbon and oxygen isotopic evolution of the solid and of the solution.We estimate that the carbon kinetic fractionation factor (KFF) associated with unidirectional precipitation of witherite via CO32-, 1000ln (13)alpha(k+1)(CO32-)(-> BaCO3) is 0.5 +/- 0.1 parts per thousand (15-40 degrees C), whereas the oxygen KFF, 1000ln (18)alpha(k+1)(CO32-)(-> BaCO3), is -1.0 +/- 0.3 parts per thousand (15 degrees C) and -0.5 +/- 0.2 parts per thousand (25-40 degrees C). The carbon KFF associated with unidirectional HCO3- precipitation pathways, 1000ln (13)alpha(k+2,+3)(H)(CO3-)(-> BaCO3), is -0.2 +/- 1.0 parts per thousand (15-40 degrees C), whereas the oxygen KFF, 1000ln (18)alpha(k+2,+3)(HCO3-)(-> BaCO3), is -6.7 +/- 1.1 parts per thousand (15 degrees C), -4.5 +/- 1.1 parts per thousand (25 degrees C) and -4.0 +/- 1.1 parts per thousand (40 degrees C). Our oxygen KFF of witherite precipitation from CO32- agrees well with the available literature estimates at 25 degrees C. In addition, our carbon and oxygen KFFs are comparable to literature KFFs associated with calcite precipitation, possibly suggesting a similarity of precipitation KFFs among carbonate minerals. Importantly, the relative magnitudes and uncertainties of the precipitation KFFs and the equilibrium fractionation between CO32- and HCO3-, leads to the expectation that in many natural settings, the isotopic composition of carbonate minerals be an insensitive probe of the precipitation pathway.

Herein, as-prepared La0.8Sr0.2Co0.8Fe0.2O3-delta (LSCF-0) is chosen as a sample to exhibit the superimposed effect of surface reconstruction accompanied by reduction of Co3+ to Co2+ on the further improvement of its activity and stability. As-synthesized LSCF-0 perovskite is chemically treated by simply immersing in an aqueous solution of NaBH4 for 1.0 h at room temperature. The optimized LSCF (LSCF-2) owns an amorphous layer consisting of nanosized particles of similar to 20 nm (vs smooth bulk crystalline surface for untreated LSCF), which exhibits superior OER performance to LSCF-0. LSCF-2 has an overpotential of 248 mV (10 mA cm(-2)) and a Tafel slope of 51 mV dec(-1) (vs 355 mV and 76 mV dec(-1) for LSCF-0 and 381 mV and 91 mV dec(-1) for LCO) and an excellent cycle stability for 20 h running.

Being highly abundant, the use of transition-metal-based OER catalysts has been attractive more recently. Among the various transition-metal-based electrocatalysts, the use of layered double hydroxides (LDHs) has gained special attention from researchers owing to their high stability under OER conditions. In this work, we have reported the synthesis of trimetallicNiCoV-LDHviaa simple wet-chemical method. The synthesizedNiCoV-LDH possesses aggregated sheet-like structures and isscreened for OER studies in alkaline medium. In the study of OERactivity, the as-prepared catalyst demanded 280 mV overpotential andthis was 42 mV less than the overpotential essential for pristineNiCo-LDH. Moreover, doping of a third metal into the NiCo-LDHsystem might lead to an increase in TOF values by almost three times. Apart from this, the electronic structural evaluation confirms that the doping of V3+into NiCo-LDH could synergistically favor the electron transfer among the metal ions, which in turn increases the activity of the prepared catalyst toward the OER.									9	0	0	0	0	0	9			0020-1669	1520-510X		WOS:000780256600032	35230844

Further, the Cr-substituted catalyst exhibits a low Tafel slope value of 44.7 mV dec(-1) than the RuO2 catalyst (63.7 mV dec(-1)).

The formation of PtO(x)was confirmed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analysis. Interestingly, the TNTs supported PtOx(Ti/TNTs/PtOx) electrocatalyst showed superior activity towards HER than the benchmark Pt/C and TiO(2)nanoparticles (TNPs) supported PtO(x)electrocatalysts.

Herein, we have developed an eco-friendly one-step process to effectively regulate the electronic structure of products by combining the concepts of alloy, heteroatoms doping, phase controlling and heterostructures. The obtained CoFe and Cog nanoparticles encapsulated in multi-doped nanoporous carbon (NPSC-Co2Fe1) exhibits a small potential gap between E-j=10 and E-1/2 of 0.75 V for bifunctional electrocatalytic O-2 redox reactions. It is revealed that defect-rich multi-doped carbon-based nanoarchitecture and electronic redistribution provide more donor-acceptor active sites with reduced energy barrier. Notably, ZABs using NPSC-Co2Fe1 as air electrodes exhibit outstanding charge-discharge performances and cycling stability superior to those of ZABs with Pt/C-IrO2. The flexible all-solid-state ZABs with NPSC-Co2Fe1 operate stably even under bending state. Moreover, these batteries are implemented to power mini-fans and LED panels.									41	2	0	0	1	0	41			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000514218900035

Herein, we present a unique worm-like structure of hierarchically porous nitrogen-doped graphene (N-rGO) embedded with cobalt nitride (Co5.47N) nanoparticles (named as Co5.47N@N-rGO) by tannic acid assisted nitridation method for Zn-air batteries and overall water splitting. Benefiting from the unique worm-like structure to expose more active sites and the synergy advantages of a close contact between Co5.47N nanoparticles and the N-rGO sheets, the Co5.47N@N-rGO exhibits efficient bifunctional catalytic activities toward oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Notably, Zn-air batteries assembled with Co5.47N@N-rGO-750 show a power density of 120.7 mWcm(-2) and excellent cycling stabilities for 330 h in an aqueous electrolyte. More interestingly, when assembled into a flexible solid-state rechargeable Zn-air battery, the Co5.47N@N-rGO-750 displays a specific capacity of 610 mAh g(zn)(-1) and good cycling stability over 40 h.

J	Formaro, L; Longhi, M				Longhi, Mariangela/F-6898-2015	Longhi, Mariangela/0000-0002-0014-3576			Influence of alkali metal cations on the rate of oxygen evolution from a mixed Mg-LiCoO2 oxide								JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY B				107	26			6425	6430		10.1021/jp027704a				JUL 3 2003	2003	O-2 evolution from a mixed Mg-LiCoO2 oxide is investigated in base solutions of alkali metal cations (0.1-2 M LiOH, KOH, or CsOH) without added supporting electrolytes. Tafel slopes range 30-50 mV/decade, scarcely related to the used alkali. However, Tafel lines are displaced to more positive potentials in passing from CsOH to KOH and LiOH at the same concentration, and moreover, reaction orders with respect to OH- decrease from similar to3 to similar to1 along the same alkali sequence with fractional rather than integer values. The reaction mechanism is examined on the assumption that Temkin-type adsorption conditions apply to the many reacting intermediates possibly involved. Analytical equations representing Tafel slope and reaction order in Temkin conditions are derived and reported for many frequently adopted O-2 evolution pathways, most of them for the first time. From these equations, the experimental behavior is reconciled with a constant mechanism (Kobussen's path) in which the rate-determining step varies depending on the alkali cation, shifting forward in the sequence of elementary steps from early positions in CsOH and KOH to the last one in which molecular O-2 is released in LiOH. Cation interactions with reacting surface sites apparently intervene to modify the reaction activation free energy profile, stronger for Li+ than K+ and Cs+. Structural relations with Li+ (and Mg2+) sites in the oxide lattice may be involved. However, the interaction sequence, Li+ > K+ > Cs+, is similar to that observed at the interface of many structurally and chemically unrelated oxides suspended in water and is attributed to entropic contributions from interactions of water molecules bonded in the hydration ion cosphere and at the oxide-solution interface.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			1520-6106			WOS:000183812000024

The Pt-decorated Ni electrocatalysts were prepared on the surface of carbon paper by Ni electrodeposition and subsequent displacement of Ni by Pt; the composition and morphology were controlled by varying HCl concentration. In half cell test, the increase of hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) activity by Pt decoration was confirmed for Pt-Ni/CP-2 that has Pt ratio of 39.4% (1.85 mu g(pt) cm(-2)). A membrane electrode assembly employing Pt-Ni/CP-2 as the HER electrode (total catalyst loading: 13.2 mu g cm(-2)) exhibited a current density of 250 mA cm(-2) at 1.9 V-cell (50 degrees C), which is comparable to the previous reports with much larger loading of 3.1 similar to 80 mg cm(-2).

In this study, we investigated the NaO2 oxidation mechanism using rotating ring disk electrode (RRDE) measurements of Na-O-2 reaction products and by tracking the morphological evolution of the NaO2 discharge product at different states of charge using scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The results show that negligible soluble species are formed during NaO2 oxidation, and that the oxidation occurs predominantly via charge transfer at the interface between NaO2 and carbon electrode fibers rather than uniformly from all NaO2 surfaces. X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements show that the band gap of NaO2 is smaller than that of Li2O2 formed in Li-O-2 batteries, in which charging overpotentials are much higher (similar to 1000 mV). These results emphasize the importance of discharge product electronic structure for rationalizing metal-air battery mechanisms and performance.									20	2	0	0	1	0	20			1944-8244			WOS:000393848900013	28173703	
J	Zhao, Kangning; Li, Xiao; Su, Dong								High-Entropy Alloy Nanocatalysts for Electrocatalysis								ACTA PHYSICO-CHIMICA SINICA				37	7					2009077	10.3866/PKU.WHXB202009077				JUL 15 2021	2021	The implementation of clean energy techniques, including clean hydrogen generation, use of solar-driven photovoltaic hybrid systems, photochemical heat generation as well as thermoelectric conversion, is crucial for the sustainable development of our society. Among these promising techniques, electrocatalysis has received significant attention for its ability to facilitate clean energy conversion because it promotes a higher rate of reaction and efficiency for the associated chemical transformations. Noble-metal-based electrocatalysts typically show high activity for electrochemical conversion processes. However, their scarcity and high cost limit their applications in electrocatalytic devices. To overcome this limitation, binary catalysts prepared by alloying with transition metals can be used. However, optimization of the activity of the binary catalysts is considerably limited because of the presence of the miscibility gap in the phase diagram of binary alloys. The activity of binary electrocatalysts can be attributed to the adsorption energy of molecules and intermediates on the surface. High-entropy alloys (HEAs), which consist of diverse elements in a single NP, typically exhibit better physical and/or chemical properties than their single-element counterparts, because of their tunable composition and inherent surface complexity. Further, HEAs can improve the performance of binary electrocatalysts because they exhibit a near-continuous distribution of adsorption energy. Recently, HEAs have gained considerable attention for their application in electrocatalytic reactions. This review summarizes recent research advances in HEA nanostructures and their application in the field of electrocatalysis. First, we introduce the concept, structure, and four core effects of HEAs. We believe that this part will provide the basic information about HEAs. Next, we discuss the reported top-down and bottom-up synthesis strategies, emphasizing on the carbothermal shock method, nanodroplet-mediated electrodeposition, fast moving bed pyrolysis, polyol process, and dealloying. Other methods such as combinatorial co-sputtering, ultrashort-pulsed laser ablation, ultrasonication-assisted wet chemistry, and scanning-probe block copolymer lithography are also highlighted. Among these methods, wet chemistry has been reported to be effective for the formation of nano-scale HEAs because it facilitates the concurrent reduction of all metal precursors to form solid-solution alloys. Next, we present the theoretical investigation of HEA nanocatalysts, including their thermodynamics, kinetic stability, and adsorption energy tuning for optimizing their catalytic activity and selectivity. To elucidate the structure-property relationship in HEAs, we summarize the research progress related to electrocatalytic reactions promoted by HEA nanocatalysts, including the oxygen reduction reaction, oxygen evolution reaction, hydrogen evolution reaction, methanol oxidation reaction, and CO2 reduction reaction. Finally, we discuss the challenges and various strategies toward the development of HEAs.									13	0	0	0	0	0	13			1000-6818			WOS:000616616500009

In this work, we report Ru2P nanoparticle decorated P/N dual-doped carbon nanofibers on carbon cloth (Ru2P@PNC/CC-900) as a highly efficient and durable hierarchical HER electrocatalyst in both acidic and alkaline media. Electrochemical tests show that this Ru2P@PNC/CC-900 possesses Pt-comparable HER activity to support 10 mA cm(-2) HER current density at low overpotential of 15 and SO mV in acidic and alkaline condition, respectively. Density functional theory calculations reveal that coupling Ru2P nanoparticles with heteroatom-doped carbon fibers leads to enhanced intrinsic HER activity. The integrative hierarchical architecture further endows high surface areas with good mechanical robustness to support abundant catalytically active sites and possesses excellent electrical conductivity and efficient access for mass transportation to facilitate the HER process.									38	1	0	0	1	0	39			2574-0962			WOS:000458706000019

Rationally integrating different active centers can promote bifunctional performance and synergistically enhance HER and OER performance. But it is still rarely reported to reasonably integrate different half-reaction centers and boost each other. Besides, the mechanism of different reaction centers that optimized each other is unclear. In this work, a 3D hierarchical heterostructure Ni/NiFe LDH, constructed by electrodeposition, provides abundant reaction centers that activate HER performance. Simultaneously, NiFe LDHs served as OER active centers, and metallic Ni improves its electric conductivity. Theoretical calculations also were used to confirm these further. Additionally, the unique hierarchical geometric structure increases the electrolyte contact area. The merits, as mentioned above, synergistically accelerate overall water splitting (OWS) and exhibit outstanding electrocatalysis performance. HER current density of the Ni/NiFe LDH heterostructure (312 mA cm(-2)) is 104 times as large as that of NiFe LDH (3.0 mA cm(-2)) with 150 mV overpotential. At 1.46 V, the OWS cell, constructed of both anode and cathode by as-synthesized Ni/NiFe LDH, can drive water splitting (10 mA cm(-2)), below noble metal Pt/C parallel to RuO2 (1.53 V). This finding provides guidance for rationally integrating different reaction centers in bi- or multi-functional electrocatalytic processes.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			2574-0962			WOS:000703338600121

The reaction mechanisms of these processes are very complicated because of the simultaneous involvement of gas, solid, and liquid phases. Although typical reaction mechanisms have been established for HCO, some of them are only appropriate for specific systems. The divergence and deficiency in mechanisms hinders the development of novel active catalysts. This critical review compares the various existing mechanisms and categorizes the catalytic oxidation of HCO into radical-based oxidation and nonradical oxidation processes with an in-depth discussion. The catalytic active sites and adsorption behaviors of O-3 molecules on the catalyst surface are regarded as the key clues for further elucidating the O-3 activation processes, evolution of reactive oxygen species (ROS) or organic oxidation pathways. Moreover, the detection methods of the ROS produced in both types of oxidations and their roles in the destruction of organics are reviewed with discussion of some specific problems among them, including the scavengers selection, experiment results analysis as well as some questionable conclusions. Finally, alternative strategies for the systematic investigation of the HCO mechanism and the prospects for future studies are envisaged.									120	4	0	0	62	0	123			0013-936X	1520-5851		WOS:000537151000004	32324393	
J	Seyrling, Sieghard; Reisch, Eugen; Ramoino, Luca								Characterization of the ozone zero phenomenon by infrared spectroscopy								OZONE-SCIENCE & ENGINEERING				40	5			356	360		10.1080/01919512.2018.1456901				2018	2018	The presence of a small amount of nitrogen in the feed gas is necessary to generate ozone efficiently out of oxygen. Operating an ozone generator with ultra-pure oxygen for extended periods results in highly deteriorated ozone generation efficiency. In extreme cases, when the nitrogen levels in the feed gas are in the lower ppm range, the efficiency of the ozone generation process even drops to zero. In this article, we present our results concerning the correlation between the N2O5 concentration in the off-gas and the ozone generation efficiency. After the ozone generator is run for a well-defined amount of time with an oxygen-nitrogen mixture, the N-2 supply is shut off, and the behavior of the system is monitored by near-infrared spectroscopy. Different surface materials lead to different temporal behavior of both the nitrogen oxide levels and the ozone concentration after shutting down the nitrogen supply. The measurements show a good correlation between the evolution of ozone generation efficiency and the changes of the N2O5 concentration in the off-gas.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			0191-9512	1547-6545		WOS:000439981800003

In spite of their different groups, they have the similarity of exhibiting a stable 3+ oxidation state. Here we have prepared Fe(III) and Al(III) based coordination polymers in the form of metal-organic gels with the 4,4', 4 ''-tricarboxyltriphenylamine (TCA) ligand, namely Fe-TCA and Al-TCA, and evaluated some important physicochemical properties. Specifically, the electrical conductivity, redox-activity, porosity, and electrocatalytic activity (oxygen evolution reaction) of the Fe-TCA system were noted to be remarkably higher than those of the Al-TCA system. As for the photophysical properties, almost complete quenching of the fluorescence originating from TCA was observed in case of the Fe-TCA system, whereas for the Al-TCA system a significant retention of fluorescence with red-shifted emission was observed. Quantum mechanical calculations based on density functional theory (DFT) were performed to unravel the origin of such discriminative behaviour of these coordination polymer systems.									13	0	0	0	1	0	13			1477-9226	1477-9234		WOS:000374549100016	26961352

To date, considerable efforts are made to improve the performance of these catalysts, but ignoring the improper synthesis strategy would incur additional cost to the catalyst. Herein, a convenient, one-step anodization method is developed for fast construction of cobalt sulfides (CoSx). Without any high-temperature or long-time treatment, mesoporous CoSx is self-grown on the metal substrate in minutes. As a result, as-anodic CoSx requires overpotentials of 102 mV for HER and 284 mV for OER to achieve a current density of 10 mA m(-2) in alkaline solution. Moreover, the tandem bifunctional as-anodic CoSx exhibits a required cell voltage of 1.64 V for overall water splitting in alkaline solution, exceeding most of the documented Co-based electrocatalysts.

Herein, a novel mixed metal 3D nanoflower POM-based composite (Co/Ni-POM) on Ni foam (denoted as Co/Ni-POM/NFs) was prepared as an electrocatalyst for the HER, with tunable synthesis parameters. The optimized Co/Ni-POM/NF sample exhibits excellent catalytic activity and high stability, manifesting in an overpotential of only 68 mV for the HER (10 mA cm(-2)) and a Tafel slope of 60.8 mV dec(-1) in 1 M KOH. The outstanding catalytic activity of Co/Ni-POM/NF stems from the synergistic effect between the metallic elements of the Co/Ni-POM and its large specific surface area. The Co/Ni-POM tightly riveted on nickel foam during the catalytic process also shows that the as-prepared catalyst is an excellent material for use in the HER.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			1144-0546	1369-9261		WOS:000661178900001

We tested the electrochemical and electrocatalytic properties of colloidally synthesized WSe2 with dodecylamine ligands before and after treatment with Meerwein's reagent, which was shown to reduce the coverage of amine and lead to an improvement in the overpotential for HER by as much as 180 mV on the same electrode (reversible upon re-ligation with amine). The underlying mechanism of the improvement in HER catalysis following treatment with Meerwein's reagent was investigated using a combination of Tafel slope analysis, electrochemically active surface area measurements, and impedance spectroscopy. These electrochemical measurements are rationalized with Fermi level and d-band center analysis from XPS. Together, these measurements suggest that, while the surface area of the WSe2 increases upon ligand stripping, the intrinsic catalytic capability of the WSe2 also changes. This is likely due to a decrease in AGH in the Meerwein's treated WSe2, improving the HER kinetics.									53	3	0	0	2	0	55			2155-5435			WOS:000398986700070

Stable reconstructed (10 x 2) and (8 x 2) segmented phases with a local coverage of more than two oxygen atoms per surface Rh atom were observed. Formation of surface oxide, which coexists with the (10 x 2) and (8 x 2) segmented adsorption phases, is evidenced at the highest O-2 doses. The development of strongly reconstructed adsorption phases with oxide-like stoichiometry and surface oxide under UHV conditions is explained in terms of the stabilization of the (1 x 2) reconstruction and promotion of O-2 dissociation by the K adatoms.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			1520-6106			WOS:000229867300022	16852477

The NiCoFe LTHs/CFC as an oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrocatalyst shows excellent catalytic activity and durability, such as low overpotential of similar to 239 mV at 10 mA cm(-2), small Tafel slope of similar to 32 mV dec(-1) and conservation rate of catalytic activity (similar to 99%) after 12 h of continuous electrolysis at 20 mA cm(-2). As a hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) electrocatalyst, NiCoFe LTHs/CFC also shows low onset potential, small Tafel slope, and superior durability. The NiCoFe LTHs/CFC-based overall water splitting exhibits a low onset potential (similar to 1.51 V), a low splitting potential (similar to 1.55 V) at 10 mA cm(-2), and excellent durability, and the performance is comparable to that of IrO2/Pt-based overall water splitting. This work will open a new avenue toward the development of high-performance and inexpensive layered triple hydroxides electrocatalysts.									269	10	0	0	9	0	273			2380-8195			WOS:000389620300021

In this work, we develop a strategy to grow multi-heterogeneous cobalt phosphide (CoP) nanorods with rich interfaces and defects along the one-dimensional (1D) nanostructure by dual incorporation of Fe and Ru (CoFeP@Ru). Such a catalyst exhibits high activity and stability towards the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER), with overpotentials of only 38 mV in 0.5 M H(2)SO(4)and 48 mV in 1.0 M KOH for HER, and an overpotential of 340 mV in 0.1 M KOH for OER at 10 mA cm(-2). Finally, as the bifunctional catalyst, an alkali electrolyzer is assembled and delivers at a low cell voltage, with almost 100 % Faradaic efficiency. Our experimental results demonstrate that Fe incorporation can disturb or even break the periodic structure of cobalt phosphides, causing a redistribution of the electronic structure and electron density of activity sites, while Ru can significantly enhance the catalytic kinetics, as well as electrochemical and mechanical stability.									4	1	0	0	0	0	5			1867-3880	1867-3899		WOS:000564331600001

The challenge is to explore a simple and cost-effective method to synthesize earth-abundant and noble-metal-free electrocatalysts with reliable hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) activity. Herein, we report a facile and scalable method to synthesize hybrid MoS2 and nickel sulfides (NiS/NiS2/Ni3S4) nanosheets (Mo-Ni-S NSs) with highly efficient HER activity in alkaline media. The hybrid phase and NSs allow large exposure of edge sites of MoS2 and construct highly active hetero-interfaces between MoS2 and NiSx and sufficient durability in alkaline solution. Mo-Ni-S NSs with optimal composition presents a low overpotential of 83 mV to reach a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) in 1.0 M KOH, which is comparable to the performance of recent reported highly active MoS2 based electrocatalysts. This work sheds light on the facile synthesis of multiple heterostructures as efficient electrocatalysts for scalable application in energy chemistry.					18th National Congress on Catalysis of China (NCC)18th National Congress on Catalysis of China (NCC)	OCT 16-20, 2017OCT 16-20, 2017	Catalysis Soc China; Hebei Univ Technol; China Natl Offshore Oil Corp Tianjin Res & Design Inst Chem IndCatalysis Soc China; Hebei Univ Technol; China Natl Offshore Oil Corp Tianjin Res & Design Inst Chem Ind	Tianjin Univ, Tianjin, PEOPLES R CHINATianjin Univ, Tianjin, PEOPLES R CHINA	18	1	0	0	0	0	18			0920-5861	1873-4308		WOS:000443966900023

However, conventional ceramic synthesis of crystalline spinels requires an elevated temperature, complicated procedures and prolonged heating time, and the resulting product exhibits limited electrocatalytic performance. It has been challenging to develop energy-saving, facile and rapid synthetic methodologies for highly active spinels. In this Article, we report the synthesis of nanocrystalline MxMn3-xO4 (M = divalent metals) spinels under ambient conditions and their electrocatalytic application. We show rapid and selective formation of tetragonal or cubic MxMn3-xO4 from the reduction of amorphous MnO2 in aqueous M2+ solution. The prepared CoxMn3-xO4 nanoparticles manifest considerable catalytic activity towards the ORR/OER as a result of their high surface areas and abundant defects. The newly discovered phase-dependent electrocatalytic ORR/OER characteristics of Co-Mn-O spinels are also interpreted by experiment and first-principle theoretical studies.									1037	53	2	0	72	0	1051			1755-4330	1755-4349		WOS:000285336900021	21160522

The cobalt ions changed the structure, morphology and chemical composition of the surface film from a loose porous film to a thin dense film. This change of surface film is the cause for the decreased rate of oxidation for the lead anode in the presence of cobalt ions. The steady state potential of the alloy during anodic oxidation decreased with (i) increasing cobalt ion concentration, (ii) increasing rotation speed, (iii) increasing temperature, (iv) decreasing acid concentration and (v) decreasing current density. The steady state potentials were lower in the presence of cobalt ions. This decrease in the steady state potential may indicate that oxygen evolution is more rapid on the more compact film formed in the presence of cobalt ions. Alternatively, an additional pathway of oxidation may be provided by the cobalt ions.									7	2	0	0	0	0	9			0021-891X	1572-8838		WOS:000251827200011

Here, we develop a bimetallic, synergistic, and highly efficient Co-Fe-P electrocatalyst for OER, by selecting a two-dimensional metal-organic framework (MOF) of Co-ZIF-L as the precursor. The Co-Fe-P electrocatalyst features pronounced synergistic effects induced by notable electron transfer from Co to Fe, and a large electrochemical active surface area achieved by organizing the synergistic Co-Fe-P into hierarchical nanosheet arrays with disordered grain boundaries. Such features facilitate the generation of abundant and efficiently exposed Co3+ sites for electrocatalytic OER and thus enable Co-Fe-P to deliver excellent activity (overpotential and Tafel slope as low as 240 mV and 36 mV dec(-1), respectively, at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) in 1.0 M KOH solution). The Co-Fe-P electrocatalyst also shows great durability by steadily working for up to 24 h. Our work thus provides new insight into the development of highly efficient electrocatalysts based on nanoscale and/or electronic structure engineering.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			0020-1669	1520-510X		WOS:000808098800020	35583467

In the framework of the so-called Chandrasekhar mass models, the progenitor's carbon-to-oxygen ratio has been suggested as a principal source of peak luminosity variations due to a variation in the production of radioactive Ni-56 during the explosion. We describe a mechanism resulting from an interplay between nucleosynthesis and turbulent flame evolution which counteracts such ail effect. Based on three-dimensional simulations we argue that it is nearly balanced and only minor differences in the amount of synthesized Ni-56 with varying carbon mass fraction in the progenitor can be expected. Therefore the progenitor's carbon-to-oxygen ratio is unlikely to account for the observed variations in type la supernova luminosity. We discuss possible effects on the calibration of cosmoloeical measurements.									41	3	0	0	0	0	41			1432-0746			WOS:000221934200001

Delays in the hydrogen and oxygen evolution reactions on Ni electrodes and slower kinetics of the reactions in heavy water compared to light water were observed. However, in both 0.01 mol/L NaOH light and heavy water solutions, Ni oxidation and passive film formation occurred at the same potential with similar passive current densities indicating a minor isotope effect of deuterium on passive film formation and growth. Polarized neutron reflectometry detected a passive film growth coefficient of 11.5 +/- 1.1 angstrom/V. The Ni consumption coefficient was determined to be 7.3 +/- 1.5 angstrom/V. Ni oxidation and passive film growth occurred mostly during the transient period after the applied potential increase but was negligible at the steady state. The electric field strength across the passive film was 8 x 106 V/cm. The Pilling-Bedworth ratio of the passive film during potentiostatic growth was close to the value of NiO grown on bulk Ni. This work demonstrated the capability of neutron reflectometry in the study of passive films on metals and alloys. (C) The Author(s) 2017. Published by ECS.

Here, we identify the origin of a 500-fold OER activity enhancement that can be achieved with mixed (Ni,Fe)oxyhydroxides (Ni1-xFexOOH) over their pure Ni and Fe parent compounds, resulting in one of the most active currently known OER catalysts in alkaline electrolyte. Operando X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) using high energy resolution fluorescence detection (HERFD) reveals that Fe3+ in Ni1-xFexOOH occupies octahedral sites with unusually short Fe-O bond distances, induced by edge-sharing with surrounding [NiO6] octahedra. Using computational methods, we establish that this structural motif results in near optimal adsorption energies of OER intermediates and low overpotentials at Fe sites. By contrast, Ni sites in Ni1-xFexOOH are not active sites for the oxidation of water.									1551	77	0	0	95	0	1564			0002-7863			WOS:000348690100042	25562406

An ideal OER catalyst should possess optimal bindings to oxygenated intermediates, neither too strong nor too weak; however, the-state-of-the-art earth-abundant 3d first-row transition-metal-based OER catalysts still operate at overpotentials significantly above the thermodynamic equilibrium. In this work, we report a facile room temperature synthesis to prepare homogeneously dispersed, amorphous 3d multi-transition-metal alloys with tunable bindings to oxygenated species. The NiFeMoB alloy with near-optimal oxygenated intermediates adsorption energy exhibits the lowest OER overpotential of only 220 mV (with 95% solution resistance correction) at 500 mA/cm(2) on nickel foam in an alkaline electrolyte, which shows no evidence of degradation at this current density following 40 h of continuous operation. By coupling an amorphous NiFeMoB oxygen-evolving anode with a crystalline NiB hydrogen-evolving cathode, we successfully demonstrate an alkaline water electrolysis cell that can be stably operated at a current density of 500 mA/cm(2) with input voltage (without solution resistance correction) only around 1.72 V in 1 M KOH at room temperature and 1.57 V in 6 M KOH at 80 degrees C.									25	0	0	0	0	0	25				2639-4979		WOS:000538342300009

Identifying their intrinsic electrocatalytic activity is challenging, as their averaged properties on ensembles can hardly be dissected from binders or additives. We here report the direct measurement of the oxygen evolution reaction at single superparticles self-assembled from similar to 8 nm NiFe2O4 and/or similar to 4 nm Au nanocrystals using scanning electrochemical cell microscopy. Combined with coordinated scanning electron microscopy, it is found that the turnover frequency (TOF) estimated from single NiFe2O4 superparticles at 1.92 V vs RHE ranges from 0.2 to 11 s(-1) and is sensitive to size only when it is smaller than similar to 800 nm in diameter. After the incorporation of Au nanocrystals, the TOF increases by similar to 6-fold and levels off with further increasing Au content. Our study demonstrates the first direct single entity electrochemical study on individual nanocrystal superlattices with tunable structures and unravels the intrinsic structure-activity relationship that is not accessible by other methods.									11	1	0	0	2	0	11			0002-7863	1520-5126		WOS:000710935500007	34612638

The major energy consuming reaction in water splitting is the thermodynamically un-favoured oxygen evolution reaction (OER) for which the noble metal oxides such as IrO2 and RuO2 have so far been extensively used as efficient electrocatalysts. However, the increased metal dissolution at high anodic overpotential and expenses associated with these materials render its implementation in large scale H-2 production. This report provides an alternative way of reducing the total RuO2 content with concomitantly increased corrosion resistance by alloying with NaPO3 at nano-scale.Methods: A detailed research and review on the existing literature has been carried out. The synthesis was carried out utilizing conventional wet-chemical and thermal annealing routes. The same was then characterized in and screened as an electrocatalyst for OER in acidic electrolyte of pH 1.Results: The successful synthesis of RuO2-NaPO3 nanocomposite was confirmed by various advanced characterizations such as XRD, HRTEM, XPS and EDS. Then the same was screened for acidic OER in comparison with the commercial catalyst RuO2 procured from Sigma. The results have shown that RuO2-NaPO3 nanocomposite required a very low overpotential of 250 mV at a current density of 10 mAcm(-2) for which the commercial catalyst required 85 mV higher potential than RuO2NaPO3 nanocomposite. Comparatively lower Tafel slope (110 mVdec(-1)) and minimum increase in overpotential at 10 mAcm-2 after cycling test for RuO2-NaPO3 nanocomposite had once again proven the advantages of alloying RuO2 with NaPO3 for harvesting synergistically enhanced OER activity with improved corrosion stability.Conclusion: A comparatively easier synthesis of RuO2-NaPO3 nanocomposite enabled the use of RuO2 with comparatively reduced loading to harvest maximum catalytic efficiency. The intentionally incorporated NaPO3 had increased the catalytic performance of RuO2 and also increased the corrosion stability as revealed by the electrochemical characterizations. The proposed approach is undoubtedly adaptable for the fabrication of highly active other electrocatalysts for OER with improved corrosion stability.									16	0	0	0	0	0	16			1573-4137	1875-6786		WOS:000405621200002

The complexation between copper ion (II) and PBBDP/C formed another catalyst, named Cu-PBBDP/C. Electrochemical tests including cyclic voltammetry (CV), linear sweep voltammetry (LSV), and rotating ring disk electrode (RRDE) were used for the characterization of the ORR activities of the catalysts. The measurements showed that both of the catalysts showed considerable stability and apparent ORR activities, and the ORR activity of Cu-PBBDP/C was much higher than that of PBBDP/C. For digging into the exact ORR mechanisms, the rate constants of possible ORR pathways were calculated as analyzed for both catalysts. For PBBDP/C catalyst, the result indicated that oxygen was reduced through two parallel routes, the four-electron pathway and the two-electron pathway taking H2O2 as the intermediate product. For Cu-PBBDP/C catalyst, the ORR was via a four-electron transfer-dominant process. In this case, the Cu-N (x) group is active sites for the direct reduction of oxygen to water.									9	1	0	0	0	0	9			1432-8488	1433-0768		WOS:000401736100014

Specifically, this technique allows a rapid and controlled synthesis of mixed metal oxide particles using plasma oxidation of liquid droplets containing mixed metal precursors. The conventional wet chemical methods for synthesis of multimetal oxide solid solutions often require time-consuming high pressure and temperature processes, and so the challenge is to develop rapid and scalable techniques with precise compositional control. The concept is demonstrated by synthesizing binary and ternary transition metal oxide solid solutions with control over entire composition range using metal precursor solution droplets oxidized using atmospheric oxygen plasma. The results show the selective formation of metastable spinel and the rocksalt solid solution phases with compositions over the entire range by tuning the metal precursor composition. The synthesized manganese doped nickel ferrite nanoparticles, NiMnzFe2-zO4 (0 <= z <= 1), exhibits considerable electrocatalytic activity toward oxygen evolution reaction, achieving an overpotential of 0.39 V at a benchmarking current density of 10 mA/cm(2) for a low manganese content of z = 0.20.									9	0	0	0	0	0	13			0884-2914	2044-5326		WOS:000379132200008

The mechanism of potential oscillations in the electrocatalytic oxidation of methanol on this film electrode in alkaline medium was studied in situ by means of Raman spectroscopy in combination with electrochemical measurements. The redox change of the nickel hydroxide film, the concentration distribution of methanol in the diffusion layer, and the oxidation products of methanol were characterized in situ by time-resolved, spatial-resolved, and potential-dependent Raman spectroscopy, respectively. Electrochemical reactions, i.e. methanol oxidation and periodic oxygen evolution, coupling with alternately predominant diffusion and convection mass transfer of methanol, account for the potential oscillations that occur during oxidation of methanol above its limiting diffusion current. This mechanism is totally different from that of methanol oxidation on platinum electrodes, for which surface steps, i.e. formation and removal of COad, are essential.									17	0	0	0	0	0	17			1432-8488	1433-0768		WOS:000229504200007

In this work, a hybrid GDY/NiFe-LDH electrocatalyst was prepared by a facile hydrothermal treatment, which shows an outstanding catalytic activity with a low overpotential of 260 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) catalytic current density and good durability towards oxygen evolution in 1.0 M KOH solution. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations prove that the sp- and sp(2)-hybridized GDY shows both superior electron capture and excellent electron transfer ability compared to that of the conventional sp(2)-hybridized carbon materials.									95	9	0	0	9	0	96			2055-6756	2055-6764		WOS:000431429400006	32254080

In the present work, we report a novel two-step method to fabricate three-dimensional (3D) porous catalyst for water splitting. The Ni3Se2 nanowires are in situ formed on Ni foam (NF) by simple hydrothermal method, subsequently NiFe layered double hydroxid (NiFe-LDH) nanosheets vertically grow on the nanowires to form core-shell structure. The as-formed Ni3Se2@NiFe-LDH/NF catalyst shows 3D porous structure, which can provide large specific surface area and effective substance transfers. The tight bonding between Ni3Se2 nanowires and NiFe-LDH nanosheets ensures good electron transfer. The Ni3Se2@NiFe-LDH/NF catalyst exhibits outstanding electrocatalytic property for both hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in an alkaline medium. The overpotentianls for HER and OER at the current density of 10 mA cm(-2) in 1 M KOH are 68 mV and 222 mV, respectively. For overall water splitting, a small cell voltage of 1.55 V can achieve a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) in 1 M KOH. This work provides a guidance for the rational design and development of heterostructure electrocatalysts for overall water splitting. (c) 2020 Elsevier Inc.

Here, we report a single-atom doped molybdenum disulfide sheet (short as X-MoS2) catalyst for the ORR using a dispersion-corrected density functional theory method. Of all the eleven X-MoS2 (X = B, C, N, O; Al, Si, P; Ga, Ge, As, and Se) systems, only the phosphorus atom doped molybdenum disulfide (P-MoS2) has an O-2 adsorption energy close to that of a Pt(111) surface. We have further explored the detailed ORR mechanism of P-MoS2. Along the four-electron reaction pathway, the reduction of OH to H2O is the rate-limiting step with the largest diffusion barrier of 0.79 eV.									15	1	0	0	1	0	15			1463-9076	1463-9084		WOS:000441089800004	29876576

Electrospinning is one of the pioneering techniques that is being utilized predominantly for the synthesis of fibers. Fibrous material has their own advantages like, high porosity over its surface, mechanical stability and fascinating physicochemical properties. With these many advantages, herein we have synthesized a distinctive nanofiber from a zeolite imidazolate framework (ZIF) based material. This powder has been mixed with PAN (polyacrylonitrile) which act as both a heteroatom source and a precursor material in the making of a fibrous material via electrospinning. The synthesized nitrogen-enriched ZIF-67 incorporated ZIF-7 microfibers were prepared under two different conditions (room temperature and N-2 atmosphere) and labeled as CoZn-ZIF-RT and CoZn-ZIF-500, respectively. The newly developed materials were assessed for the first time in electrocatalytic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) studies have been carried out in a 1 M KOH electrolyte.

It has been shown that simple manipulation of processing parameters, including scan rate and number of cycles, allows for formation of the NPs in various diameters and amounts. The polarization data with respect to transmission electron microscopy (TEM) allowed for determination of the diameter and propagation depth of the Ni NPs leading to the highest activity towards the OER with an overpotential of 540 mV at +10 mA cm(-2) and Tafel slope of 52 mV per decade. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) indicates the presence of structure defects within Ni NPs whereas Mott-Schottky analysis provides information on the anodically shifted flat band potential and highly increased donor density. The obtained results along with literature studies allowed a proposal of the origin of the enhancement towards the OER. We believe that combination of transition metal-based NPs and TNT provides valuable insight on efficient and low-cost electrocatalysts.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1				2046-2069		WOS:000614277900026	35423041

The preparation of heterostructures is considered an effective method to improve catalytic activity. Herein, we describe the design and assembly of a dual-MOF heterostructure (CoNi-ZIF-67@Fe-MIL-100, denoted ZIF@MIL). Specifically, we grew a layer of MIL-100 in situ on a bimetallic ZIF-67 surface using a solvothermal method. We demonstrate that the ZIF@MIL has remarkable OER electrocatalytic performance, requiring a low overpotential and showing a small Tafel slope, compared to pure ZIF-67 and MIL-100 in 1.0 m KOH. More importantly, it has excellent operational durability for 50 h at 100 mA cm(-2). The high catalytic activity of ZIF@MIL can be attributed to the heterostructure that can expose more active sites, the synergistic effect between ZIF-67 and MIL-100, and improvement of electron transfer ability. Our work provides a new way to design and prepare dual-MOF crystals with different structures as electrocatalysts.									11	1	0	0	0	0	11			1861-4728	1861-471X		WOS:000594789800001	33200561

Here, a facile and novel strategy for the generation of porous amorphous cobalt oxide through one-step treatment of the cobalt carbonate hydroxide precursor with concentrated sulfuric acid has been reported. Benefiting from the optimized amorphous structure, the prepared catalyst exhibits an excellent water-oxidation activity in an alkaline electrolyte with the demand of 50 mV less overpotential at 10 mA cm(-2) compared to that of highly-crystallized Co3O4. Compared with the 400 degrees C annealing process for Co3O4, the ultrafast acid treatment process within 10 seconds at room-temperature for achieving such amorphous cobalt oxide demonstrates tremendous convenience. More impressively, after continuous testing for 60 h at an overpotential of 370 mV, it still maintains a porous configuration as well as similar to 92% of the original current density. Our findings not only present a high-efficiency OER electrocatalyst, but also provide a methodology with broad applicability toward the systematic study of other non-crystal oxides for green energy applications.									15	0	0	0	0	0	15			1359-7345	1364-548X		WOS:000457875500022	30667425

We show that the synthesis of iridium nanoparticles in either low purity ethanol or water, or in the absence of a surfactant, is detrimental to the electrocatalytic properties of the materials. Adding NaBH4 in excess improves the purity of the catalyst enhancing the OER activity up to 100 A g(Ir)(-1) at 1.51 V vs. RHE, the highest value reported so far for high purity Ir nanoparticles. The measured OER activity correlates with the capacitive current rather than with the charge corresponding to the Ir-III/Ir-IV oxidation peak. Operando near-ambient pressure X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (NAP-XPS) on membrane electrode assemblies (MEAs) with the synthesized catalysts reveals a metallic core surrounded by a thin layer of Ir-III/IV oxides/hydroxides. Oxidation of IrIII leaves behind a porous ultrathin layer of Ir-IV oxides/hydroxides, which dominate the surface during the OER, while IrV was not detected.									60	2	0	0	1	0	60			2041-6520	2041-6539		WOS:000429203500019	29780489

Designing MoP nanoparticles as catalysts is a feasible strategy to enhance the electrocatalytic performance for HER. In response, we report the fabrication of ultrafine MoP nanoparticles (NPs) which are uniformly embedded on glucose derived phosphorus and nitrogen co-doped carbon nanosheets (MoP/NPG) as an effective electrocatalyst for HER via a novel and simple solid-state reaction. Transmission electron micro scopy reveals that the resulting product exhibits an average size of 3.15 nm. Due to the presence of exposed active sites in ultrafine MoP NPs and the laminar structure of carbon nano sheets, the MoP/NPS shows remarkable high catalytic activity having a low overpotential of 90 and 115 mV to achieve the current density of 10 mAcm(-2) in both, acidic and alkaline media, which demonstrates the promising potential for an application in sustainable energy production.									19	2	0	0	0	0	20			2196-0216			WOS:000445654900016

Herein, we report that electrodeposited nickel-phosphorous (Ni-P) films can act as efficient bifunctional electrocatalysts for overall water splitting. The as-prepared Ni-P films exhibit remarkable catalytic performance for both H-2 and O-2 evolution reactions (HER and OER) in alkaline media, achieving a current density of 10 mAcm(-2) at overpotentials of -93 mV for HER and 344 mV for OER with Tafel slopes of 43 and 49 mVdec(-1), respectively, rivaling the performance of Pt and IrO2. Various techniques were employed to probe the composition and morphology of the Ni-P films prior to and post catalysis, revealing the major composition of the as-prepared and post-HER films as metallic nickel and nickel phosphide, which partially transform to nickel oxides during OER. It was also found that the catalytic rate of OER catalyzed by Ni-P was first order in the activity of the hydroxide anion.									133	3	0	0	3	0	134			1867-3880	1867-3899		WOS:000370031400011

To date, the rational design and engineering of heterojunctions based on three or more components has been rather limited. Herein, by taking advantage of the high intrinsic activity of NiFe layered double hydroxide (LDH), strong synergistic effects between different components, and good electronic conductivity of reduced graphene oxide (rGO), we demonstrate the successful synthesis of NiMoO4/NiFe LDH/rGO nanosheets. As a proof-of-concept demonstration, the multicomponent nanosheet catalyst with a well-modified electronic structure is applied to boost the electrochemical OER and achieve decent electrocatalytic activity in 1 M KOH electrolyte, which can deliver a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) with an overpotential of merely 270 mV and a small Tafel slope of 76.2 mV dec(-1), which are markedly superior to those of the commercial RuO2 catalyst (303 mV, 131.9 mV dec(-1)).

Herein, the novel efficient Ni2P/Fe3O4 porous nanosheets arrays supported on Ni foam (Ni2P/Fe3O4/NF) as alkaline OER catalysts were synthesized using structural and interfacial engineering. The three-dimensional (3D) porous hierarchical structure of Ni2P/Fe3O4/NF provides abundant active sites for OER and facilitates the electrolyte diffusion of ions and O-2 liberation. Furthermore, the strong interfacial coupling and synergistic effect between Ni2P and Fe3O4 modify the electronic structure, resulting in the enhanced intrinsic activity. Consequently, the optimized Ni2P/Fe3O4/NF exhibits excellent OER performance with low overpotentials of 213 and 240 mV at 60 and 100 mA cm(-2) in 1.0 M KOH, respectively, better than the RuO2/NF and most Ni/Fe-based OER catalysts. Impressively, it can maintain its catalytic activity for at least 20 h at 60 mA cm(-2). In addition, the relationship between the structure and performance is fully elucidated by the experimental characterizations, indicating that the metal oxyhydroxides in situ generated on the surface of catalysts are responsible for the high OER activity.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			0020-1669	1520-510X		WOS:000712069300038	34543021

The coordination environment around the metal ion of the catalyst plays a pivotal role in this context. We have chosen dinuclear mixed-valence (CoCoII)-Co-III complexes of the general formula of [(CoCoII)-Co-III(LH2)(2)(X)(H2O)] (X = OAc or Cl) which bear a coordinated water molecule in the primary coordination sphere. We anticipated that the water molecule in the primary sphere can take part in the proton coupled electron transfer (PCET) mechanism which can accelerate the facile formation of the O-O bond under strong alkaline conditions (1 M NaOH). To understand the role of the coordinated water molecule we have generated an analogous complex, [(CoCoII)-Co-III(LH2)(2)(o-vanillin)] (o-vanillin = 2-hydroxy-3-methoxybenzaldehyde), without coordinated water. Interestingly, we have found that the water coordinated complexes show better oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity and stability.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			1477-9226	1477-9234		WOS:000698339100001	34553710

ELECTROCHIMICA ACTA				299				372	377		10.1016/j.electacta.2018.12.159				MAR 10 2019	2019	Aiming at a better understanding of the air electrode processes in Mg-air batteries, the influence of Mg2+ ions is studied on the oxygen reduction (ORR) and oxygen evolution (OER) reactions in the ionic liquid 1-butyl-1-methylpyrrolidinium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl) imide (BMP-TFSI) by differential electrochemical mass spectrometry (DEMS). The numbers of electrons transferred per reduced O-2 molecule are determined in cyclic voltammetry (CV) and potential step measurements, both in absence and presence of Mg2+. The numbers of transferred electrons indicate that in neat BMP-TFSI a transition from superoxide to peroxide formation takes place when applying more negative potentials. In the presence of Mg2+, the formation of superoxide can be found in potential step measurements to potentials >= -0.4 V (vs. Mg/MgO) and in CV measurements on largely passivated electrode surfaces. In contrast, mainly peroxide is formed when stepping to -1.2 V (vs. Mg/MgO) and at the beginning of the ORR in CV measurements. The formation of superoxide in the presence of Mg2+, on the passivated electrode, is found to be partly reversible, as indicated by the evolution of O-2 detected via DEMS. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

Novel hierarchical Co-based oxide/selenide/phosphide (Co-A, A = O, Se, P) hexagrams have been chosen as model materials. Electrochemical results and theoretical calculations reveal that the electron configuration, the electrical conductivity, and the oxidation potential of Co element in Co-A hexagrams could be moderated by the substitution of P atoms, which leads to the superior OER performance. Particularly, Co-P hexagram displays a low overpotential (eta= 269 mV) at j = 10 mA/cm(2) for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) compared to Co-O hexagram (eta= 399 mV) and Co-Se hexagram (eta= 347 mV). This work is of great importance in understanding coordination atoms (O, Se and P) induced electrocatalytic properties of hierarchical Co-based materials.

Pristine graphene (rather than reduced graphene oxide or graphene with a damaged electronic structure) supported NiFe alloy nanoparticles (NPs) have been synthesized for the first time via tannic acid (TA)-mediated in situ controlled assembly, in which TA not only noncovalently modifies the graphene to strongly coordinate with Ni2+ and Fe2+ but also in situ reduces these metal ions to alloy NPs. The chemical composition of these alloy NPs can be tailored via changing the ratio of Ni2+ and Fe2+ in the reaction. These nanohybrids show ultrahigh and tunable OER catalytic activities. The optimum one obtained using the ratio of 9:1 achieves 10 mA cm(-2) at an oveipotential of 246 mV and shows a Tafel slope of 46 mV dec(-1), both of which are lower than those of most reported OER catalysts, including state-of-the-art Ru- and Ir-based ones. In addition, this catalyst exhibits little change of the overpotential after 20 h of chronopotentiometric measurement (from 246 to 258 mV at 10 mA cm(-2)) and negligible current loss after 1000 CV cycles (from 123.3 to 133.4 mA cm(-2) at 1.54 V). The superior catalytic activity and durability are ascribed to the in situ assembled small, highly dispersed, and highly conductive NiFe alloy NPs on pristine graphene significantly facilitating the electron transfer and increasing the electrochemically accessible active sites, the doped FeOOH remarkably promoting the intrinsic activity of Ni(OH)(2) on the surface of these alloy NPs, and the robust in situ growth greatly enhancing the durability during the OER testing. This work provides a green, facile, and economical strategy to controllably fabricate low-cost and high-performance OER catalysts and also sheds light on the performance enhancement mechanism from tunable OER catalytic activity.									12	0	0	0	0	0	12			2574-0962			WOS:000529190300094

The challenge comes as how to rationally design the chemical composition and nanostructure to increase the OER efficiency. In this work, we demonstrated an operational ion strategy to improve OER performances of iron cobalt bimetallic phosphide (Fe0.5Co-P), which was fabricated by simultaneous annealing and phosphating metal organic framework (MOF) precursors. The iron regulates the charge density of the Co sites, changing the electronic structure of the phase interface for endowing dramatically enhanced OER activity. The Fe0.5Co-P catalyst possesses excellent durable and reliable characteristics and exhibits dramatically enhanced OER efficiency with an overpotential of only 260 mV to drive a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) and a Tafel slope of 65.53 mV dec(-1) in 1.0 M KOH. The work provides useful insights into the design and synthesis of multicomponent metal phosphides-based OER catalysts for practical application in water splitting. (C)& nbsp;2022 Elsevier Inc.

Anodic oxidation of iron monosilicide in sulfuric acid solution containing sodium fluoride								Condensed Matter and Interphases				17	1			91	101						2015	2015	The purpose of the work is to investigate the mechanism and the kinetics of the anodic processes on FeSi-electrode in 0.5 H2SO4 + (0.005 - 0.05) M NaF. The methods of polarization curves and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy have been used. It has been shown that the active anodic dissolution of FeSi is determined by the processes of metal ionization and silicon oxidation. The reaction of silicon oxidation passes through the electrochemical and chemical stages and at the same time hydrogen evolution also takes place. Hydrogen evolution on FeSi is caused by the chemical reaction between silicon (II) oxygen-containing compounds with H2O and HF. The passivation of FeSi occurs due to the silicon oxidation to SiO2. The kinetics of the total process of FeSi oxidation in the range of potentials of active dissolution and active-to-passive transition is determined by the reaction of silicon oxidation. The influence of NaF on FeSi dissolution in sulfuric acid solution is due to the reduction of passivating ability of SiO2.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			1606-867X			INSPEC:15626371

NiFe-based compounds, mainly oxides and hydroxides, are well-known OER catalysts and have been intensively studied; however, the utilization of the synergistic effect between two different NiFe-based materials to further boost the OER performance has not been achieved to date. Here, we report the rapid conversion of NiFe double hydroxide into metallic NiFeP using PH3 plasma treatment and further construction of amorphous NiFe hydroxide/NiFeP/Ni foam as efficient and stable oxygen-evolving anodes. The strong electronic interactions between NiFe hydroxide and NiFeP significantly lower the adsorption energy of H2O on the hybrid and thus lead to enhanced OER performance. As a result, the hybrid catalyst can deliver a geometrical current density of 300 mA cm(-2) at an extremely low overpotential (258 mV, after ohmic-drop correction), along with a small Tafel slope of 39 mV decade(-I) and outstanding long-term durability in alkaline media.									401	14	1	0	14	0	402			2380-8195			WOS:000401500200013

Organic moieties with two and three -NH2 or -OH functionalities inherit subsequent ordered 2D and 3D arrangements of the atoms and molecules to attain the morphologies such as nanotubes, nano/micro-spheres, fibers, nanosheets, and covalent organic frameworks (COFs). Auto-doping is a strategic feature of PPN materials to originate binary-, ternary-, and quaternary-doped carbon frameworks and graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) upon direct pyrolysis in an inert environment. Hollow carbon spheres provides a good range of surface areas (ca. 755-3673 m(2)/g) with enormous active sites and hierarchical channels for the effective flow of electrolyte ions, which make them a good choice for solid-state batteries and supercapacitors; structural irregularities and imperfections offer surface-adsorbed breakdown of water and open new horizons for water splitting through hydrogen evolution, oxygen evolution and oxygen reduction with the lowest half-wave (E-1/2) potential when compared to Pt/C- and Pt/C+RuO2-based electrocatalysts.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			2196-0216			WOS:000608847700001

The alpha-Fe2O3-H@CoO-H/Ti foil (TF) synthesized by two-step calcination process is used as a photoanode for solar to hydrogen energy. The scanning electron microscopy and transmission electron microscopy indicate the multi-level nanowheat-like structure with defects on the surface. It is favorable for light absorption and separation of the charge carrier. The crystal structure and composition were analyzed by the X-ray diffraction, Raman, X-ray fluorescence, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy studies. The photocurrent density of alpha-Fe2O3-H@CoO-H/TF is 1.60 mA/cm(2) at 1.23 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) and 14.63 mA/cm(2) at 1.6 V versus RHE. The resistance and combination of the charge carrier at the interface of the photoanode/electrolyte and photoanode/TF are greatly decreased from electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. The collaborative improvement of the nanowheat-like morphology, residual little Co element as the oxygen evolution reaction catalyst, and oxygen vacancy in the surface defect after the hydrogen calcination are significant for photoelectrochemical water splitting.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			0887-0624	1520-5029		WOS:000716453500070

Currently, the ORR mechanism for NPM catalysts is not well understood, prohibiting the design and preparation of improved NPM catalysts. We conducted a kinetic isotope effect (KIE) study to identify the rate-determining step (RDS) of this intricate electrocatalytic reaction involving multiple proton-coupled electron transfer (PCET) processes. We observed a KIE of about 2 for the ORR catalyzed by a NPM catalyst, which demonstrates that for these electrocatalysts protons are involved in the RDS during ORR These results contribute to a more complete understanding of the ORR mechanism and suggest that the design of future NPM catalysts must include careful consideration of the role of protons during ORR.									39	1	0	0	2	0	39			1948-7185			WOS:000383641800002	27550191

Here, we report a theoretical study of the structure of beta-NiOOH, one of the active components of NiOx. Using a genetic algorithm search of crystal structures combined with dispersion-corrected hybrid density functional theory calculations, we identify two groups of favorable structures: (i) layered structures with alternate Ni(OH)(2) and NiO2 layers, consistent with the doubling of the c axis observed in high resolution transmission electron microscopy (TEM) measurements, and (ii) tunnel structures isostructural with MnO2 polymorphs, which can provide a rationale for the mosaic textures observed in TEM. Analysis of the Ni ions oxidation state further indicates a disproportionation of half of the Ni3+ cations to Ni2+/Ni4+ pairs. Hybrid density functionals are found essential for a correct description of the electronic structure of beta-NiOOH.									46	2	0	0	1	0	47			1948-7185			WOS:000345542900007	26276481

Superaerophobic electrodes, usually constructed by their surface microstructures, have demonstrated excellent performance for electrochemical gas evolution reactions due to their bubble-repellent properties. Understanding and quantification of the gas bubble behavior including nucleation and dynamics on such micro-structured electrodes is an important but underexplored issue. In this study, we reported a scanning electrochemical cell microscopy (SECCM) investigation of individual gas bubble nucleation and dynamics on nanoscale electrodes. A classic Pt film and a nonconventional transition-metal dichalcogenide MoS2 film with different surface topologies were employed as model substrates for both H-2 and N-2 bubble electrochemical studies. Interestingly, the nanostructured catalyst surface exhibit significantly less supersaturation for gas bubble nucleation and a notable increase of bubble detachment compared to its flat counterpart. Electrochemical mapping results reveal that there is no clear correlation between bubble nucleation and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) activity, regardless of local electrode surface microstructures. Our results also indicate that while the hydrophobicity of the nanostructured MoS2 surface promotes bubble nucleation, it has little effect on bubble dynamics. This work introduces a new method for nanobubble electrochemistry on broadly interesting catalysts and suggests that the deliberate microstructure on a catalyst surface is a promising strategy for improving electrocatalytic gas evolution both in terms of bubble nucleation and elimination.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			0003-2700	1520-6882		WOS:000696518100026	34460230

Hence, interconnected trimetallic PtPbPd ultrathin nanowires (PtPbPd NWs) were synthesized by octylphenoxypolyethoxyethanol (NP-40)-mediated one-pot aqueous method, using in-situ generated hydrogen bubbles as the dynamic template. It is found that the types of the precursors and the amount of NP-40 are critical in this synthesis. The as-obtained architectures showed remarkable improvement in the electrocatalytic properties for ethanol oxidation reaction (EOR) and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), surpassing those of commercial Pt/C (20 wt%), homemade PtPd NWs, PtPb NWs and PdPb NWs. Specifically, the mass activity (MA)/specific activity (SA) of PtPbPd NWs (1.20 A mg(-1)/2.78 mA cm(-2)) is higher than those of Pt/C (0.86 A mg(-1)/1.79 mA cm(-2)) in 0.5 M KOH solution. Furthermore, the as-synthesized catalyst displayed a positive-shift of the onset potential (E-onset, 0.993 V) for ORR over Pt/C (0.895 V) in 0.1 M KOH electrolyte. These scenarios manifest that this approach provides some new valuable guidelines for preparing novel trimetallic nanocatalysts in energy storage and conversion applications.

Systematic screening of 3d, 4d, and 5d transition metal dopants indicates general trends with dopant band filling and allows us to identify the most efficient dopants with respect to the overpotential and relate those to the solution energy and electronic properties. Different conditions (electrochemical vs photoelectrochemical) are accounted for by considering hydroxylated, hydrated, and oxygenated terminations. Based on the DFT+U results, we identify Rh as the most promising dopant that can reduce the overpotential both under dark and illumination conditions: from 0.56 V to 0.48 V for the hydroxylated surface and quite substantially from 1.12 V to 0.31 V for the hydrated termination and from 0.81 V to 0.56 V for the oxygenated surface. The origin of this improvement is attributed to the modification of the binding energy of chemisorbed species to the Fe2O3(0001) surface. Investigation of the spin density of intermediate steps during the OER shows that surface iron ions adopt a wide range of oxidation states (+2, +3, and +4) in pure hematite, depending on the termination and chemisorbed species on the surface, but a Fe+3 state is stabilized predominantly upon doping. While Rh is in the +3 state in the bulk, it transforms to +4 at the surface and acquires a finite magnetic moment in several intermediate steps.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			0021-9606	1089-7690		WOS:000522212100001	32241156

Nickel derivate occupies the most important place when it comes to the transition metal-based electrocatalyst. In this study, we used a simple and extremely effective controllable pulsed laser irradiation (PLI) technique to fabricate dual-phase nickel sulfide, and we studied cation modulation using Co and Cu atoms. The multifunctional activity was witnessed by the performances of oxygen evolution reaction (OER), hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), and methanol oxidation reaction (MOR) measured in an alkaline medium. The cation adjustment resulted in the improvement of the catalytic performance of HER and OER during Cu and Co substitution, respectively. For the Co-Ni-S sample in OER, we achieved an overpotential of 368 mV at 10 mA/cm(2) in OER. The higher ECSA Cu-Ni-S sample improved HER activity at a lower overpotential of 271 mV at 10 mA/cm(2) and a lower Tafel slope of 98 mV/dec. The excellent bifunctional activity enhanced overall water splitting with a lower voltage of 1.88 V to achieve a geometrical current density of 10 mA/cm(2), with high durability. Meanwhile, the high selectivity of Cu resulted in a very high methanol electrooxidation activity with a current density as high as 55.4 mA/cm2. The detailed electrochemical studies were presented with their supporting physiochemical analysis. This report shows the efficiency and simplicity of fabricating transition metal derivatives and cation modulation using superficial laser methods.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0016-2361	1873-7153		WOS:000806815600005

Moreover, the designing of highly efficient oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrocatalysts across the universal pH conditions was more challengeable as in harsh anodic potentials, it questions the activity and stability of the concerned catalyst. Generally, geometrical engineering and electronic structural modulation of the catalyst can effectively boost the OER activity. Herein, a Co-doped RuO2 nanorod material is developed and used as an OER electrocatalyst at different pH conditions. Co-RuO2 exhibits a lower overpotential value of 238 mV in an alkaline environment (1 M KOH) with a Tafel slope value of 48 mV/dec. On the other hand, in acidic, neutral, and near-neutral environments, it required overpotentials of 328, 453, and 470 mV, respectively, to attain a 10 mA/cm(2) current density. It is observed that doping of Co into the RuO2 could synergistically increase the active sites with the enhanced electrophilic nature of Ru4+ to accelerate OER in all of the pH ranges. This study finds the applicability of earth-abundant-based metals like Co to be used in universal pH conditions with a simple doping technique. Further, it assured the stable nature in all pH electrolytes and needs to be further explored with other metals in the future.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000736848100001	34951298

A facile strategy has been developed to fabricate highly active electrodes with hierarchical porous structures by using a two-step electrodeposition method, in which NiFe layered double hydroxide is grown in situ on a three-dimensional hierarchical Ni mesh (NiFe/Ni/Ni). The as-prepared NiFe/Ni/Ni electrodes demonstrate remarkable structural stability with high surface areas, effective gas transportation, and fast electron transfer. Benefiting from the unique structure, the self-supported NiFe/Ni/Ni electrodes exhibit overpotentials of 190 mV and 300 mV for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) at current densities of 10 and 500 mA cm(-2), respectively. Furthermore, the self-supported NiFe/Ni/Ni electrodes also exhibit high performance in the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and excellent stability at a current density of 500 mA cm(-2) for both OER and HER. Remarkably, using NiFe/Ni/Ni as both the cathode and anode for alkaline water electrolysis, a current density of 500 mA cm(-2) is attained at a cell voltage of 1.96 V. Additionally, the water electrolyzer demonstrates superior stability even at a large current density (500 mA cm(-2)) when subjected to high temperatures.									37	3	0	0	0	0	40			1864-5631	1864-564X		WOS:000480187400001	31310446

The effects of sintering temperature and atmosphere on phase structure, microstructure evolution and dielectric properties were investigated. The results show that neither sintering temperature nor atmosphere affects the phase structure. However, the morphological studies revealed differences between the microstructure of ceramics sintered in different conditions of temperature and atmosphere. Ceramic sintered at 1373 K in oxygen showed optimum relative density and excellent dielectric properties with low dielectric losses.

The photosynthetic machinery has had to cope with continuously changing environmental conditions and particularly with the complex ionizing radiation emitted by solar flares. The photosynthetic D1 protein, being the site of electron tunneling-mediated charge separation and solar energy transduction, is a hot spot for the generation of radiation-induced radical injuries. We explored the possibility to produce D1 variants tolerant to ionizing radiation in Chlamydomonas reinhardtii and clarified the effect of radiation-induced oxidative damage on the photosynthetic proteins evolution. In vitro directed evolution strategies targeted at the D1 protein were adopted to create libraries of chlamydomonas random mutants, subsequently selected by exposures to radical-generating proton or neutron sources. The common trend observed in the D1 aminoacidic substitutions was the replacement of less polar by more polar amino acids. The applied selection pressure forced replacement of residues more sensitive to oxidative damage with less sensitive ones, suggesting that ionizing radiation may have been one of the driving forces in the evolution of the eukaryotic photosynthetic apparatus. A set of the identified aminoacidic substitutions, close to the secondary plastoquinone binding niche and oxygen evolving complex, were introduced by site-directed mutagenesis in untransformed strains, and their sensitivity to free radicals attack analyzed. Mutants displayed reduced electron transport efficiency in physiological conditions, and increased photosynthetic performance stability and oxygen evolution capacity in stressful high-light conditions. Finally, comparative in silico analyses of D1 aminoacidic sequences of organisms differently located in the evolution chain, revealed a higher ratio of residues more sensitive to oxidative damage in the eukaryotic/cyanobacterial proteins compared to their bacterial orthologs. These results led us to hypothesize an archaean atmosphere less challenging in terms of ionizing radiation than the present one.									17	0	0	0	13	0	17			1932-6203			WOS:000286515000034	21249156

However, most of the promising candidates thus far are exclusively metal-based catalysts, which are disadvantaged by relatively restricted electron mobility, corrosion susceptibility, and detrimental environmental influences. Herein, hierarchically porous nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) codoped carbon nanofibers directly grown on conductive carbon paper are prepared through an electrochemically induced polymerization process in the presence of aniline monomer and phosphonic acid. The resultant material exhibits robust stability (little activity attenuation after 12 h continuous operation) and high activity with low overpotential (310 mV at 10 mA cm(-2)) toward electrocatalytic oxygen production, with performance comparable to that of the precious iridium oxide (IrO2) benchmark. Experimental measurements reveal that dual doping of N and P can result in an increased active surface area and abundant active sites in comparison with the single doped and pristine carbon counterparts, and density functional theory calculations indicate that N and P dopants can coactivate the adjacent C atoms, inducing synergistically enhanced activity toward OER.									118	5	0	0	3	0	119			1614-6832	1614-6840		WOS:000405839400024

In this work, we demonstrate a novel graphene coated/Co9S8 nanoparticles-embedded nitrogen doped porous carbon dodecahedron hybrid (Co9S8/NPCP@rGO) prepared by the pyrolysis and sulphuration of precursors composing of graphene oxide and zeolitic imidazolate-frameworks (ZIP). The Co9S8/NPCP@rGO hybrid is used as a highly efficient nonprecious metal electrocatalyst for oxygen reduction and exhibits more positive onset potential and half-wave potential, higher limiting current density, lower Tafel slope, and better durability and methanol tolerance in alkaline media in comparison to the commercial 20 wt.% Pt/C catalyst. The greatly improved electrocatalytic performance of Co9S8/NPCP@rGO can be attributed to the unique structure with Co9S8 nanoparticles dispersed uniformly inside nitrogen doped porous carbon matrix, and the synergistic effect between Co9S8/NPCP polyhedral hybrid and rGO.

The beauty of this work is that a special carbon precursor is used for the synthesis of the electrocatalyst, a waste material, i.e., cow dung. The performance of the cow dung derived nanodisc electrocatalyst (Pd@WO3-NDs) toward oxygen evolution reaction (OER), oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) is compared with three other electrocatalysts (derived from graphene oxide, chitosan, and graphite carbon sources) also, and it is found that Pd@WO3-NDs show superior performance over that of the other three. The electrocatalyst exhibits the lowest onset potential (1.32 V vs NHEs), highest current density (492 mA cm(2)), lowest overpotential (113 mV), and lowest Tafel slope (62.8 mV dec(1)) for OER; an onset potential of 1.02 V, overpotential of 195.0 mV, and Tafel slope of 53.1 mV dec(1)) for ORR; and lowest onset potential (-0.09 V), overpotential (185 mV at 10 mA cm(2)), and a small Tafel slope of (58.2 mV dec1) for HER in the same alkaline solution. In addition, the nanomaterial is successfully applied for the fabrication of rechargeable and all-solid-state zincair batteries, which are used to illuminate a 4.0 V light emitting diode (LED) bulb. More importantly, real air cathodes made from the trifunctional Pd@WO3-NDs demonstrated superior performance to state-of-the-art Pt/C catalysts in rechargeable zincair batteries. In addition, the same Znair battery is further used to power the laboratory-made total alkaline water electrolyzer by employing Pd@WO3-NDs as catalyst on both anode and cathode. The water electrolyzer showed comparable performance rivalling the state-of-art combination of Pt/C and RuO2, which is known to be the best of the bifunctional total-water splitting electrocatalysts reported until date. This remarkable performance of Pd@WO3-NDs indicates their future potential in energy storage and sustainable energy conversion technologies.									21	2	0	0	0	0	21			2168-0485			WOS:000414825900027

Herein, nonsaturated oxidation in plasma-enhanced atomic layer deposition is leveraged to tune the structural, mechanical, and optical properties of biphasic cobalt hydroxide films, thereby tailoring their catalytic activities and chemical stabilities. Short oxygen plasma exposure times and low plasma powers incompletely oxidize the cobaltocene precursor to Co(OH)(2) and result in carbon impurity incorporation. These Co(OH)(2) films are highly porous and catalytically active, but their electrochemical stability is impacted by poor substrate adhesion. In contrast, long exposure times and high powers completely oxidize the precursor to Co3O4, reduce the carbon incorporation, and improve the crystallinity. While the Co3O4 films have high electrochemical stability, they are characterized by low oxygen evolution reaction activity. To overcome these competing properties, the established relation between deposition parameters and functional film properties is applied to design bilayer films exhibiting simultaneously improved electrochemical performance and chemical stability. The bilayer films combine a highly active Co(OH)(2) surface with a stable Co3O4 interface layer. These coatings exhibit minimal light absorption, thus making them suitable as protective catalytic layers on semiconductor light absorbers for application in photoelectrochemical devices.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2196-7350			WOS:000815013500001

The morphology and compositional characteristics of the 3D hierarchitectures (HAs) of ZHS MCs were investigated by various techniques such as XRD, FESEM, TEM, UV-vis spectra, BET, XPS and EPR. In the reaction system the morphology evolution from cube to sphere was controlled by adding a different concentration of NH4OH. Meanwhile, the formation mechanisms of the two ZHS MCs were studied via a series of time-dependent experiments. Interesting, ZHS MCs were self-assembled from irregular-shaped nanoparticles (5-10 nm). The XPS and EPR tests demonstrated oxygen vacancy defects existed in the ZHS MCs. The gas sensors based on ZHS presented a good sensor performance towards HCHO. However, the gas sensors based on of ZHS spherical MCs exhibited a higher response, shorter recovery time and good reproducibility towards HCHO than those of ZHS cubic MCs. More importantly, the best gas sensing properties were found coming from the similar to 600 nm spherical ZHS MCs owing to more oxygen vacancy defects, lower band gap energy, and larger active surface area.									48	4	0	0	2	0	51			1466-8033			WOS:000303168700008

However, low UEOR activity and the poisoning issue of the catalyst limit its practical application. Herein, a simple coordination reaction is used to synthesize the dimethylglyoxime-NiII complex (DMGNiII), which efficiently serves as the initial precursor to synthesize nitrogen-doped carbon nanorodsupported nickel phosphide nanoparticle (Ni2P/N-Cnanorods) nanocomposites. The density functional theory calculations and electrochemical results reveal that nitrogen doping can weaken the adsorption of hydrogen and the generated CO2, resulting in an enhancement of hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and UEOR activity. In addition, N-doping can also promote the generation of Ni3+, which can further promote the UEOR and HER performance. Concretely, the overpotential for the HER on Ni2P/N-Cnanorods-2h nanocomposites is only 201 mV at 10 mA cm-2, and the onset potential of the UEOR on Ni2P/NCnanorods-2h nanocomposites is only 1.34 V. Additionally, the Ni2P/N-Cnanorods nanocomposites also show excellent long-term stability due to the introduction of nitrogen-doped carbon material. Consequently, the symmetric Ni2P/N-Cnanorods-2h||Ni2P/N-Cnanorods-2h urea electrolyzer requires 1.41 V of electrolysis voltage for urea electrolysis, which can be applied in energy-saving H2 production and environment purification.(c) 2022 Science Press and Dalian Institute of Chemical Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences.

Results from the Rh/graphene bilayer show that the Rh atoms that directly interact with graphene occupy most of the area of the supported metal sheet, and they exhibit better hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) activity than Rh and even than Pt. The interlayer charge transfer, rather than the intralayer charge transfer, leads to the downshift of the d-states of these Rh atoms in energy and weakens the H-Rh binding. This allows the HER process to be almost thermo-neutral. Support interactions determine whether the interlayer charge transfer or the intralayer charge transfer is dominant in the bilayer and surface corrugations on the two sheets. A different structure-activity relationship is present in two-dimensional systems. This study on the corrugation-sensitive HER activity and the activation mechanism of Rh/graphene heterobilayers is also helpful for the design of more ultrathin precious or non-precious metal/graphene heterostructures used as electrodes in water electrolysis.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			1463-9076	1463-9084		WOS:000461722500045	30742152

Herein, for the first time, heterostructured porous nanorod of CoP nanoparticles anchored on Mn3O4 porous nanorods (Mn3O4/CoP PNRs) was fabricated via a selective phosphidation and targeted reduction strategy from MnO2/Co3O4 precursor. Due to the in-situ conversion process, an interpenetrated interface Mn-O-Co-P are formed, which may induce a strong electronic coupling effect between CoP and Mn3O4, thus improving the charge transfer and electrocatalytic activity. Well, phosphorization can also modulate the surface structure of spinel Mnx2+Mn3-x3+O4, which may enhance its electrical conductivity and inspire its activity. The hetemstructured Mn3O4/CoP PNRs exhibits superior HER and OER activity, as evidenced by low overpotentials of 43 mV (vs. HER) and 306 mV (vs. OER), to achieve a current density of 10 mA cm(-2), small Tafel slopes of 28.9 mV dec(-1 )(vs. HER) and 51.8 mV dec(-1) (vs. OER) in an alkaline medium. Impressively, an alkaline overall water-splitting electrolyzer made of this catalyst only requires a low cell voltage of 1.599 V to reach 10 mA cm(-2), which is comparable to the most cobalt phosphide-based catalysts.									11	0	0	0	1	0	11			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000618288000006

It is consistently understood that the forming kinetics of the primary oxide tetrahedron and its derivative on the valence density-of-states (DOS) are intrinsically common for all these analyzed systems, though the patterns of observation in terms of morphology and crystallography vary from situation to situation. However, the lattice size and electronegativity of the host surfaces determine extrinsically the site selectivity of the oxygen, the order of bond formation and the orientation of the oxide tetrahedron.

In those tapes the change in oxygen content was montiored during the first heat treatment by means of a macro-thermogravimetrical method suitable for long sample lengths, The main result is that highly alloyed AgMg sheaths and especially barrier tapes hinder significantly the oxygen diffusion during BSCCO(2223) formation.

This work demonstrated that nitrogen doping improved the HER activity of ruthenium oxide by letting its Delta G(H*) approach zero or facilitating hydrogen desorption process. A highly nitrogen-doped ruthenium oxide catalyst guaranteeing the ruthenium-nitrogen intimacy was prepared by employing a polymer whose nitrogen-containing moiety (pyrrolidone) was strongly coordinated to ruthenium ion in the precursor solution prior to calcination. The less electronegative nature of nitrogen (when compared with oxygen) decreased the free energy uphill required for desorption of hydrogen intermediate species sitting on the nitrogen (H-*N to 1/2 H-2 + *N) to make the desorption process more favored. Also, the nitrogen dopant facilitated OH desorption from its neighboring ruthenium site (HO-*Ru + e(-) to HO- + *Ru) since the less electronegative nitrogen withdrew less electrons from the ruthenium site. The ruthenium-nitrogen intimacy of the catalyst more than doubled the electrocatalytic HER current from 33 mA cm(-2) for an undoped RuO2 to 79 mA cm(-2) for the nitrogen-doped RuO2 at -50 mV(RHE).									5	0	0	0	1	0	5			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000720473800004

In this study, ZnS modified N, S dual-doped interconnected porous carbon (ZnS/NSC) derived from the dye sludge waste is successfully fabricated via a facile ZnCl2-assisted pyrolysis process. The effect of ZnCl2 and carbonization temperature on the microstructure and electrocatalytic performance is systematically investigated.

Bimetallic sulfide possesses superior physicochemical properties due to the synergistic effect between bimetallic cations. By introducing a metal -semiconductor interface, the physicochemical properties of transition metal sulfide can be further improved. Using the solvothermal method, Au@NiCo2S4 core-shell heterostructure nanoparticles (NPs) and bare NiCo2S4 NPs were prepared. The measurement of the OER catalytic performance showed that the catalytic activity of Au@NiCo2S4 core-shell heterostructure was enhanced compared to bare NiCo2S4 NPs. At the current density of 10 mA cm(-2), the overpotential of Au@NiCo2S4 (299 mV) is lower than that of bare NiCo2S4 (312 mV). The Tafel slope of Au@NiCo2S4 (44.5 mV dec(-1)) was reduced compared to that of bare NiCo2S4 (49.1 mV dec(-1)), indicating its faster reaction kinetics. Detailed analysis of its electronic structure, chemical state, and electrochemical impedance indicates that the enhanced OER catalytic performances of bare Au@NiCo2S4 core-shell NPs were a result of its increased proportion of high-valance Ni/Co cations, and its increased electronic conductivity. This work provides a feasible method to improve OER catalytic performance by constructing a metal-semiconductor core-shell heterostructure.									8	0	0	0	0	0	8				2079-4991		WOS:000539577200014	32230724

One challenge is to find an electrolyte/cathode system that is efficient, stable, and cost-effective. We present such a system based on molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) nanoflakes combined with an ionic liquid (IL) that work together as an effective cocatalyst for discharge and charge in a Li-O-2 battery. Cyclic voltammetry results show superior catalytic performance for this cocatalyst for both oxygen reduction and evolution reactions compared to Au and Pt catalysts. It also performs remarkably well in the Li-O-2 battery system with 85% round-trip efficiency and reversibility up to 50 cycles. Density functional calculations provide a mechanistic understanding of the MoS2 nanoflakes/IL system. cocatalyst reported in this work could open the way for exploiting the unique properties of ionic liquids in Li-air batteries in combination with nanostructured MoS2 as a cathode material.									151	13	0	0	7	0	154			1936-0851	1936-086X		WOS:000370987400055	26789516

Here, we investigated the HER electrocatalytic activity of pentagonal PdS2 (penta-PdS2) and PdSe2 (penta-PdSe2) by first-principles calculations. Three types of vacancies (V-S/Se, V-Pd, DVS/Se) were constructed to activate the inert basal planes of PdS2 and PdSe2. The results show that S/Se and Pd vacancies significantly improve HER performance, and the Gibbs free energy (Delta G(H)) of systems can be further regulated by vacancy concentration. Particularly, PdS2 with 2.78% V-S, 50% V-Pd and PdSe2 with 12.5% V-Se display the optimal Delta G(H) value and the highest exchange current density. Further analysis of charge transfer and band structures were described that the introduce of vacancies efficiently regulates the electronic properties, resulting in the diminution of bandgap, and accelerates the charge transfer, thereby contributing to an enhanced electron environment for HER process. Our results provide a theoretical guidance for the applications of pentagonal transition-metal dichalcogenides as catalysts of hydrogen evolution reaction.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1				2046-2069		WOS:000723813000001	35493256

Machine learning (ML) methods have provided new avenues for intelligent screening and predicting efficient heterogeneous catalysts in recent years. We coalesce density functional theory (DFT) and supervised ML methods to discover earth-abundant active heterogeneous NiCoCu-based HER catalysts. An intuitive generalized microstructure model was designed to study the adsorbate's surface coverage and generate input features for the ML process. The study utilizes optimized eXtreme Gradient Boost Regression (XGBR) models to screen NiCoCu alloy-based catalysts for HER. We show that the most active HER catalysts can be screened from an extensive set of catalysts with this approach. Therefore, our approach can provide an efficient way to discover novel heterogeneous catalysts for various electrochemical reactions.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1948-7185			WOS:000843541600001	35950905

Traditionally, surface strain is imposed by external stress from a heterogeneous substrate, but the effect is often obscured by interfacial reconstructions and nanocatalyst geometries. Here, we report on a strategy to resolve these problems by exploiting intrinsic surface stresses in two-dimensional transition metal nanosheets. Density functional theory calculations indicate that attractive interactions between surface atoms lead to tensile surface stresses that exert a pressure on the order of 10(5) atmospheres on the surface atoms and impart up to 10% compressive strain, with the exact magnitude inversely proportional to the nanosheet thickness. Atomic-level control of thickness thus enables generation and fine-tuning of intrinsic strain to optimize catalytic reactivity, which was confirmed experimentally on Pd(110) nanosheets for the oxygen reduction and hydrogen evolution reactions, with activity enhancements that were more than an order of magnitude greater than those of their nanoparticle counterparts.									246	18	0	0	17	0	251			0036-8075	1095-9203		WOS:000459387100044	30792302

The long-term stability depends entirely on the electrochemical and corrosion properties of device components. Single-phase mesoporous Ni-rich Ni-Pt thin films have shown to be a promising electrocatalyst for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and therefore with potential application in fuel cells, water electrolysers or similar devices. The HER activity of the mesoporous Ni-Pt films is reliable and stable in 0.5 M H2SO4 up to 200 linear sweep voltammetry cycles, however leaching of Ni occurs in absence of cathodic polarisation. Long-term electrolysis measurements at a HER current of -10 mA/cm(2) reveal an increase in potential over time, which is minimised when the Pt content is increased. In 1 M NaOH, the material is stable up to an applied anodic limit of 1.5 V vs. Ag vertical bar AgCl although surface passivation takes place at 1.0 V. If the anodic limit does not exceed 0.6 V vs. Ag vertical bar AgCl, a fully reversible redox reaction is observed by cyclic voltammetry, with redox charges increasing with Pt content and scan speed. In addition, significantly higher current densities are recorded for mesoporous films compared to dense counterparts. This charge/discharge behaviour of the redox reaction indicates that the mesoporous Ni-Pt films may as well be used as an electrochemical supercapacitor. As a HER catalyst, the material is safely applicable in alkaline media. (C) 2020 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			0013-4686	1873-3859		WOS:000575853200014

Herein, Ni3Se2 nanowire arrays with a rich-grain-boundary are rationally grown on a nickel foam (NF) substrate by the solvothermal method. Under optimized conditions, the Ni3Se2 nanowire arrays prominently display high areal capacitance of 635 mu A h cm(-2) at a current density of 3 mA cm(-2) and excellent rate capability. As an asymmetric supercapacitor, the Ni3Se2 electrode (cathode) shows a high energy density of 42.6 W h kg(-1) at a power density of 284.8 W kg(-1). When used as a two-dimensional (2D) electrode for water splitting reaction, the Ni3Se2 electrode exhibits high catalytic activity to achieve 100 mA cm(-2) at an overpotential of 320 mV in the oxygen evolution reaction and a low overpotential of 95 mV at a current density of 50 mA cm(-2) in the hydrogen evolution reaction in a 1.0 M KOH solution. The Ni3Se2 nanowire array electrode is shown to be a high-performance alkaline water electrolyzer with current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at a cell voltage of 1.62 V. The results demonstrate Ni3Se2 as a promising 2D highly active electrode for electrochemical energy storage and conversion applications.									78	9	0	0	2	0	79			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000458682100040

In 1.0 M KOH, this Co-P@NC/CC shows outstanding catalytic activity with the demand of a low overpotential of 75 mV to drive 10 mA cm(-2), outperforming most reported Co-P catalysts.

It is widely accepted that the atmospheric O-2 level was low (<1% PAL or < 10% PAL) and the ocean remained predominantly anoxic with the development of sulfidic (H2S rich) continental margins. It is suggested that 2-10% of seafloor euxinia was sufficient to deplete some micronutrients in the ocean inventory, such as Mo and Cu, which are essential for nitrogen-fixation for eukaryotes. However, recent studies report multicellular fossils and episodic/sporadic inception of oceanic oxidation in Mesoproterozoic. These findings imply the possible occurrences of oxygen oasis that provided habitable niches for eukaryote evolution. Such oxygen oasis likely developed at shallow marine seafloor covered with microbial mat, where O-2 produced by benthic cyanobacteria resulted in the oxygenation of seafloor. Therefore, in order to constrain the habitability of Mesoproterozoic oxygen oasis, it is essential to reconstruct the O-2 fugacity in the seafloor. In this study, we analyzed pyrite sulfur isotopes and pyrite contents of the Mesoproterozoic Wumishan Formation (similar to 1.4 Ga). The Wumishan Formation is composed of cyclic deposition of, in a shoaling upward sequence, the subtidal calcareous shale, massive thrombolitic dolostone, and microbial laminated dolostone. Both microbial laminated dolostone and thrombolytic dolostone precipitation involved with microbial activities, and thus might record the redox condition of putative oxygen oasis in the Mesoproterozoic oceans. We apply the One-Dimensional Diffusion-Advection-Reaction (1D-DAR) model to simulate diagenetic pyrite formation in sediments. Sedimentation rate can be well constrained by the depositional cycles of the Wumishan Formation. The modelling results indicate that more than 60 similar to 80% of H2S that was generated in microbial sulfate reduction (MSR) was reoxidized, and that organic matter supply, both from surface water and seafloor, was limited. Thus, our study indicates that the seafloor could be substantially oxygenated in Mesoproterozoic, even when the atmospheric O-2 level was extremely low. Shallow marine seafloor covered with microbial mat may function as the oxygen oasis, providing habitable niches for the evolution of eukaryotes.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0301-9268	1872-7433		WOS:000832989300002

As confirmed by XRD, XPS, TEM and energy dispersive spectroscopy analyses, the products generated showed different degrees of selenization according to the nature of the chemical precursor. Such degree of selenization was more important with elemental selenium, in contrast to SeO2. Surface electrochemistry and CO stripping in alkaline medium, clearly revealed the different interactions and stability of Pd(x)Se(y)achieved with the Pd/C precursor depending on the selenium source. The electrocatalysis of the oxygen reduction reaction was also influenced by the Se source, first in the different degree of reactivity, and second in the selectivity of the reduction product between H2O and H2O2, as well as the tolerance to the methanol oxidation reaction.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			0953-8984	1361-648X		WOS:000662034700001	34011696

Here, we report the effect of quite inactive and active substrates on the catalytic activity and stability of non-crystal Fe-Cu-Co ternary thin film oxides deposited on stainless steel mesh (SSM) and copper mesh (CuM) by pulsed-spray evaporation chemical vapor deposition (PSE-CVD) technique, was investigated for CO oxidation. The Fe-Cu-Co ternary oxides thin film was thoroughly characterized in terms of structure, morphology, chemical composition, ionic state and optical properties. The obtained results showed that the catalytic performance and stability depended on the nature of the interphase between the metal substrate and the deposited thin film ternary oxides. The physicochemical properties disclosed the formation of needle-like shaped morphology, which leads to sufficient contact area for surface oxygenated species of ternary oxides, which provided abundant sites for oxygen evolution. Moreover, metallic species (Fe3+, Co3+, Co2+ and Cu2+) and electrophilic oxygenated species (O-2(2-) or O-) were confirmed to co-exist at the surface and offered effectual synergetic effects on oxidation reaction with better reducibility. The open porosity of nano-grains, abundance of surface metallic and reactive oxygen species, thermal and electrical conductivities, high reducibility at low temperature due to low optical bandgap energies played together a crucial role in the catalytic oxidation reaction. The ternary oxides exhibited attractive performance towards the total oxidation of CO with a high gas hourly space velocity of 81,818 mL.g(-1).h(-1). The light-off curves shifted towards lower temperature, when ternary oxides thin film deposited on CuM and used in the reaction. Therefore, the doping strategy of active substrate (in the absence of any other oxygen promoter and noble metals support) is used to adapt highly active transition-metal ternary oxides at low temperature, which could further be a very promising way to significantly increase the activity of ternary oxides for catalytic applications.									3	1	0	0	1	0	3			0927-7757	1873-4359		WOS:000504350600055

Herein, we present a new catalyst-free synthetic strategy of self-squeezing and rolling of B, N co-doped graphene nanosheets to nanotubes with tunable dimensions and atomic bonds as metal-free electrocatalysts for enhancing the ORR and HER using (polyethylene glycol (PEG)) as the directing agent. We found that the PEG with a higher molecular weight favors the formation of B, N co-doped graphene nanosheets with a high concentration of B-N bonds in a carbon framework whereas the one with a lower molecular weight leads to B, N co-doped graphene nanotubes (BCN nanotubes) with segregated B-C and N-C bonds. The as-prepared graphene nanostructures show interesting atomic bonds and dimension-dependent electrocatalytic activity towards the ORR and HER with BCN nanotubes being the best. The BCN nanotubes show Pt-like ORR activity and much better ORR stability than commercial Pt/C catalysts. They also exhibit excellent HER activity with a very low overpotential and a small Tafel slope of 92 mV dec(-1). The present work highlights the importance of tuning atomic bonds and dimensions of carbon nanomaterials for achieving highly efficient electrocatalysts for the ORR and HER.									110	2	0	0	7	0	111			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000387166900022

"Single-atom catalysis" has recently appeared on the catalytic spectrum, and has truly merged the benefits that homogeneous and heterogeneous analogues have to offer. Further still, the possibility to activate these catalysts by means of a suitable electric potential could pave the way for a true integration of diverse synthetic methodologies and renewable electricity. Despite their esteemed benefits, single-atom electrocatalysts are still limited to the energy sector (hydrogen evolution reaction, oxygen reduction, etc.) and numerous examples in the literature still invoke the use of precious metals (Pd, Pt, Ir, etc.). Additionally, batch electroreactors are employed, which limit the intensification of such processes. It is of paramount importance that the field continues to grow in a more sustainable direction, seeking new ventures into the space of organic electrosynthesis and flow electroreactor technologies. In this piece, we discuss some of the progress being made with earth abundant homogeneous and heterogeneous electrocatalysts and flow electrochemistry, within the context of organic electrosynthesis, and highlight the prospects of alternatively utilizing single-atom catalysts for such applications.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			0306-0012	1460-4744		WOS:000788173000001	35481480

In this study, nanoflower-like Co-MoS2/NiCoS structure supported on reduced Graphene Oxide (rGO) was rationally developed via a simple hydrothermal route, where the synergistic regulations of both interface structural and electronic conductivity were successfully presented by using controllable interface engineering and Co metal ions doped into MoS2 nanosheets. Ascribed to the 3D flower-like nano-structure with massive active sites, the interface coupling effect between MoS2 and Ni-Co-S phase, and Co-doped MoS2 can modulate its surface electronic density. The optimal Co-MoS2 /NiCoS/rGO hybrid exhibits excellent HER activity in 1.0 M KOH, with a small overpotential (eta(10), 84 mV) at 10 mA cm(-2) and a low Tafel slope (46 mV dec(-1)), accompanied by good stability. This work provides an effective route to produce other electrocatalysts based on interface structure and electronic conductivity engineering for HER in the future.

In this system, Cu(I) is bound to a tren unit that caps the calixarene core at the level of the small rim. As a result, although protected from the reaction medium by the macrocycle, the metal center presents a labile site accessible to small guest ligands. Indeed, in the presence of O-2, it reacts in a very fast and irreversible redox process, leading, ultimately, to Cu(II) species. In the coordinating solvent MeCN, a one electron exchange occurs, yielding the corresponding [CalixtrenCu-MeCN](2+) complex with concomitant release of superoxide in the reaction medium. In a noncoordinating solvent such as CH2Cl2, the dioxygen reaction leads to oxygen insertions into the ligand itself. Both reactions are proposed to proceed through the formation of a superoxide-Cu(II) intermediate that is unstable in the Calixtren environment due to second sphere effects. The transiently formed superoxide ligand either undergoes fast substitution for a guest ligand (in MeCN) or intramolecular redox evolutions toward oxygenation of Calixtren. Interestingly, the latter process was shown to occur twice on the same ligand, thus demonstrating a possible catalytic activation Of O-2 at a single cuprous center. Altogether, this study illustrates the oxidizing power of a [CuO2](+) adduct and substantiates a mechanism by which copper mono-oxygenases such as DOH and PHM activate O-2 at the Cum center to produce such an intermediate capable of C-H breaking before the electron input provided by the noncoupled Cu-H center.									57	0	0	0	7	0	57			0002-7863	1520-5126		WOS:000257796500066	18576623

Through a process of rapid solidification and two-step dealloying, we have successfully fabricated three-dimensional mesoporous PtM (M = Co, Cu, Ni) nanowire catalysts, which show much enhanced electrocatalytic properties towards MOR and ORR in comparison with the commercial Pt/C catalyst. Electrochemical tests indicate that alloying with Cu presents the best ORR activities, the half-wave potential of which is 42 mV positively shifted compared with the commercial Pt/C (0.892 V vs. RHE). Meanwhile, the PtM nanowire catalysts also possess good CO tolerance as well as stability for 10 000 cycles of cyclic voltammetry scanning. This convenient preparation method is promising for the development of high performance electrocatalysts for MOR and ORR in DMFCs.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3				2046-2069		WOS:000648718400010	35424024

(HER). The most active catalyst is a Co-, N-, and S-tridoped carbon (CoNS-C), which was prepared through heat treatment of nitrogen- and sulfur-enriched poly(m-aminobenzenesulfonic acid) and cobalt(II) nitrate, followed by acid leaching. The presence of cobalt-heteroatom complexes in CoNS-C is confirmed and identified as highly active molecule catalytic centers for HER. The overpotential of CoNS-C is 180 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) in 0.5 M aqueous H2SO4. Besides the high HER activity, the CoNS-C also shows excellent durability and can be produced readily in large quantities. This work may have provided a new and simple route in the design and batch-synthesis of highly active and durable carbonaceous electrocatalysts for HER.									36	1	0	0	1	0	36			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000377150400018	27172131

In this study, the perfected pi-conjugated g-C3N4 (P-Na-g-C3N4) photocatalysts were constructed by coordination between 3p orbits of Na and N 2p lone electron at vacancy structure of tri-s-triazine polymer for ROS evolution and elimination of HCHO and NO. The perfected pi-conjugated structure enhances the visible-light capturing capability, enriches active sites for O-2 activation, and promotes the directional charge transfer from N 2p of C-3-N to Na and C. Therefore, the superior activities including the evolution of O-2(-) (35 mu mol.L(-1)h(-1)), and H2O2 (517 mu mol.L(-1)h(-1)) have been achieved over P-Na-g-C3N4 photocatalyst. As a result, P-Na-g-C3N4 photocatalysts demonstrate high performances removal efficiency of NO (53% for 6 min), and HCHO (almost 100% for 55 min) in the elimination process. The results may provide the promising strategy to construct efficient photocatalytic system to yield ROS for environmental purification. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc.

To further tune the catalytic performance and multifunctionality, the designed fabrication of multicomponent high-entropy nanocomposites such as high-entropy alloy@high-entropy oxides (HEA@HEO) should be very promising. In this work, we design a two-step alloying-dealloying strategy to synthesize ultra-small HEA nanoclusters (similar to 2 nm) loaded on nanoporous HEO nanowires, and the compositions of both the HEA and HEO can be adjusted separately. To demonstrate this concept, a seven-component HEA (PtPdAuAgCuIrRu) clusters@seven-component HEO (AlNiCoFeCrMoTi)(3)O-4 was prepared, which is highly active for both oxygen evolution and reduction reactions. Our comprehensive experimental results and first-principles density functional theory (DFT) calculations clearly show that better oxygen evolution reaction (OER) performance is obtained by optimizing the composition of the HEO support, and the seven-component HEA nanocluster is much more active for the ORR when compared with pure Pt due to the modified surface electronic structure. Specifically, the high-entropy composite exhibits an OER activity comparable to the best reported value, and the ORR activity exceeded the performance of commercial Pt/C in alkaline solutions with a record-low bifunctional Delta E of 0.61 V in 0.1 M KOH solution. This work shows an important route to prepare complex HEA@HEO nanocomposites with tuned catalytic performance for multifunctional catalysis and energy conversion.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2041-6520	2041-6539		WOS:000848762000001

Herein, a novel PEGylated DES composed of PEG 200 and thiourea was formed for the first time and used for solvothermal synthesis of nickel cobalt sulfides. The structure and composition of the as-synthesized sulfides can be tuned by adjustment of the ratio of the reactants. The PEGylated DES plays multiple roles as a solvent, a shape-control agent, and a sulfur source in the synthesis of sulfides. Compared with traditional sulfuration routes, this proposed route is cost-effective and energy-efficient by combining solvothermal synthesis and the sulfuration process. The prepared sulfides were used as catalysts for electrochemical water oxidation and they exhibited excellent oxygen evolution reaction (OER) performance, especially for NiCo2S4 with hierarchical pores. The overpotential (eta) demand was 337 mV for the current density reaching 10 mA cm(-2) and the Tafel slope was 64 mV dec(-1) in an alkaline medium (1 M KOH) for NiCo2S4. In addition, NiCo2S4 demonstrated long-term stability with little deactivation after either thirty hours of continuous operation or two thousand cycles and a high faradaic efficiency of 95.8%. Synergistic effects including a relatively high Brunauer-Emmett-Teller area, abundant active sites, easy diffusion of electrolytes and oxygen gas, and strong structural integrity contribute to the high activity and long-term stability of the catalyst for OER. This study provides a new method for the synthesis of hierarchically structured metal sulfides for energy conversion and storage applications.									109	7	0	0	7	0	112			1463-9262	1463-9270		WOS:000404609200016

In this work, the nanocomposite of NiFe layered double hydroxides (NiFe-LDHs) and MWCNT was synthesized by the direct coating of MWCNT with NiFe-LDH nanoparticles (NPs) under ultrasonic assistance. It was found out that MWCNT can be easily dispersed in the NiFe-LDH suspension. The dispersed MWCNT was simultaneously coated with NiFe-LDH NPs via the electrostatic interaction between the negatively charged MWCNT and positively charged NiFe-LDH NPs. The obtained nanocomposite (NiFe-LDH/MWCNT) exhibits tubelike structure and good dispersity in polar solvents such as ethanol and water. Further investigation shows that NiFe-LDH/MWCNT possesses excellent ORR activity with 4e-route selectivity, suggesting the synergistic effect between NiFe-LDH and MWCNT. Moreover, NiFe-LDH/MWCNT exhibited improved catalytic capability and durability than commercial Pt/C catalysts.									18	0	0	0	1	0	18			1572-6657	1873-2569		WOS:000443664700060

As one of the attractive means, water splitting has attracted widespread attention because of its great potential in storing electricity in the form of chemical fuel which also makes it a promising solution to the utilization of non-grid electricity generated by solar or wind. The oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is generally deemed as the key rate-limiting step of water splitting, and thus studying efficient OER electrocatalysts with a low overpotential and good stability is of vital importance. Here, we successfully prepared an OER catalyst with excellent electrochemical performance through a simple anion doping. Firstly, a stable cubic perovskite SrCoO3- was prepared by anion F-doping instead of traditional A and/or B site doping. Secondly, SrCoO2.85-F0.15 demonstrates excellent OER activity superior to its parent hexagonal compound H-Sr2Co2O5 and those perovskites prepared via complicated A- and/or B-site doping. DFT calculations and XPS investigations reveal that the cubic structure and the highly oxidative oxygen species (O-2(2-)/O-) via F- doping jointly contribute to the better OER properties of SrCoO2.85-F0.15. Our work brings forth a promising strategy to stabilize cubic structures from hexagonal ones via a simple anion doping strategy, which may open a new avenue for the development of even more effective OER catalysts and may be applied in many other fields related to structure transformation, in addition to energy and catalysis fields.									62	5	0	0	3	0	62			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000472219400015

Several synthetic approaches such as encapsulation of nanoparticles in dendrimers, coating by polyethylene glycol and surface modification by anthraquinone were carried out to isolate the nanoparticles from aqueous corrosive media and to prevent their agglomeration at very low and very high pH. In all the attempts described, negative results towards ORR were consistently obtained. On the contrary, in the case of cobalt incorporated in a polypyrrole matrix (Co-Ppy-C) a catalytic activity for oxygen reduction both in acidic and alkaline medium was observed. The data indicate that neither Ni nor Co surface sites, when not coordinated to the matrix nitrogen, are electroactive towards oxygen reduction, pointing out the crucial role of the heteroatom associated with (coordinating) transition metals in the ORR catalytic process. We believe that our data are in agreement with literature although the reported data scarcity does not make the full conclusion possible. All results were obtained at room temperature, the catalytic activity of the synthesized materials at elevated temperatures are unknown. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

The studied photocatalyst shows good photoactivity under sun-like excitation for the degradation of methylene blue (MB) and for O-2 evolution. From structural and morphological characterization, it has been stated that the presence of lanthanides induces the stabilization of the tetragonal phase. This is probably due to the substitutional occupation that occurs in the BiVO4 lattice. The photocatalytic performance under visible-NIR radiation clearly evidences the occurrence of an up-conversion process involved in the overall photo-electronic mechanism. The tetragonal phase Er-0.0075, Y-0.03-Bi0.9625VO4 system gives the highest O-2 evolution rate (425 mu mol g(-1) h(-1)) under sun-like excitation, being 8 times higher than that attained for m-BiVO4 (53 mu mol g(-1) h(-1)).									35	0	0	0	5	0	35			2044-4753	2044-4761		WOS:000337132100022

Benefiting from a combination of mechanisms, the optimized N-Mo2C@CoNi-650 shows remarkable hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) activity with small overpotentials of 35, 123, and 220 mV to reach the current density of 10, 50, and 100 mA cm(-2) in alkaline media, respectively, outperforming most previously reported HER electrocatalysts. The efficient electrocatalytic performance is ascribed to the highly exposed active sites, fast reaction kinetics, and improved charge-transfer steaming from the synergistic effect between each component.

The successful achievements for this application are based mainly on transition metal oxides and some metal sulfides/nitrides. Recently, metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), a class of hybrid functional materials comprising organic backbone tethered infinitively in limitless way by metal-oxide clusters, both of which can be customized accurately at the molecular level for targeted applications, have been able to photocatalytically degrade water. Herein, it is first aimed to comprehensively review fundamentals of water splitting catalyzed by semiconductor photocatalysts, which casts light on understanding of challenges in this area, thus providing strategies for development, if not rational design, of visible-light-driven MOFs that are capable of degrading water to hydrogen and oxygen. The recent advancements of using MOF photocatalysts for water splitting are further described in a way that benchmark achievements and limitations are considered so that the readers can imagine the big picture in this field and pay considerable attention to future solutions.									13	0	0	0	0	0	13			2367-198X			WOS:000652275300001

Herein, the novel photocatalysts consisting of MoO3 and varying amounts of cadmium sulfide (CdS) nanospheres were successfully prepared via the one-pot hydrothermal method in the presence of polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP). It is indicated that the PVP not only served as the reducing agent for the formation of oxygen defects in MoO3-x but also the cross-linking agent for the coupling between MoO3-x and CdS. The CdS/MoO3-x composite allowed for higher visible-light photocatalytic performance for enhanced removal of methylene blue and tetracycline with an efficiency of 97.6% and 85.5%, respectively. The improved performance of the CdS/MoO3-x composite was found to be mainly attributable to the remarkable charge carrier separation and transfer between CdS and MoO3-x based on the favorable hole-transporting nature and oxygen deficiencies of MoO3-x. In addition, the hole-oxidized photocorrosion of CdS was efficiently suppressed due to the presence of hole-attractive MoO3-x. At the solid interface, an oxygen-defects-mediated Z-scheme charge carrier transfer pathway was proposed as the underlying mechanism for the superior photocatalytic reaction.									18	1	0	0	5	0	19			0268-2605	1099-0739		WOS:000464452800028

Herein, we develop an electrochemical sacrificial-template strategy to fabricate hollow Co3O4 microtube arrays with hierarchical porosity. The resultant unique structures and integrated electrode configurations impart enhanced mass transfer and electron mobility, ensuring high activity and stability in catalyzing oxygen and hydrogen evolution reactions. Impressively, the apparent performance can rival that of state-of-the-art noble-metal and transition-metal electrocatalysts. Furthermore, this bifunctional electrode can be used for highly efficient overall water splitting, even competing with the integrated performance of Pt/C and IrO2/C.									560	26	0	0	27	0	563			1433-7851	1521-3773		WOS:000394997700025	27900829

The palladium-implanted electrodes were studied with respect to their electrocatalytic properties for the hydrogen and oxygen evolution reactions in 30% KOH solution. Results showed that the implanted electrodes were much more active than the untreated ones and had an increase in electrocatalytic activity with increasing implantation dose. The relative kinetic parameters were obtained by polarization measurements. These values showed that the titanium electrode implanted with high dose of palladium ions was similar to palladium electrode in these electrochemical properties. The surface compositions of implanted electrodes were discussed based on AES and XPS data.									1	1	0		0	0	1			0567-7351			WOS:A1994PZ27600003

In this work, first, the prepared CoMoS nanomaterials through solvothermal treatment have a porous, defect-rich, and vertically aligned nanostructure, which is beneficial for the HER in an alkaline medium. Second, electron transfer from cobalt to MoS2 that reduces the unoccupied d orbitals of molybdenum can also enhance the HER kinetics in an alkaline medium. This has been demonstrated via a comparison of the catalytic performances of CoMoS, CoS, and MoS2. Third, the solvothermal treatment time evidently impacts the electrocatalytic activity. As a result, after 24 h of solvothermal treatment, the prepared CoMoS nanomaterials exhibit the lowest onset potential (42 mV) and overpotential (98 mV) for delivering a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) in a 1 M KOH solution. Thus, this study provides a simple method to prepare efficient electrocatalysts for the HER in an alkaline medium.									79	5	0	0	1	0	81			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000394481800028	28099799	
J	Delvaux, Adeline; Lumbeeck, Gunnar; Idrissi, Hosni; Proost, Joris								Effect of microstructure and internal stress on hydrogen absorption into Ni thin film electrodes during alkaline water electrolysis								ELECTROCHIMICA ACTA				340						135970	10.1016/j.electacta.2020.135970				APR 20 2020	2020	Efforts to improve the cell efficiency of hydrogen production by water electrolysis continue to address the electrochemical kinetics of the oxygen and hydrogen evolution reactions in detail. The objective of this work is to study a parasitic reaction occurring during the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), namely the absorption of hydrogen atoms into the bulk electrode. Effects of the electrode microstructure and internal stress on this reaction have been addressed as well in this paper. Ni thin film samples were deposited on a Si substrate by sputter deposition with different deposition pressures, resulting in different microstructures and varying levels of internal stress. These microstructures were first analyzed in detail by Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM). Cathodic chrono-amperometric measurements and cyclic voltammetries have then been performed in a homemade electrochemical cell. These tests were coupled to a multi-beam optical sensor (MOS) in order to obtain in-situ curvature measurements during hydrogen absorption. Indeed, since hydrogen absorption in the thin film geometry results in a constrained volume expansion, internal stress generation during HER can be monitored by means of curvature measurements. Our results show that different levels of internal stress, grain size and twin boundary density can be obtained by varying the deposition parameters. From an electrochemical point of view, this paper highlights the fact that the electrochemical surface mechanisms during HER are the same for all the electrodes, regardless of their microstructure. However it is shown that the absolute amount of hydrogen being absorbed into the Ni thin films increases when the grain size is reduced, due to a higher grain boundaries density which are favourite absorption sites for hydrogen. At the same time, it was concluded that H-2 evolution is favoured at electrodes having a more compressive (i.e. a less tensile) internal stress. Finally, the subtle effect of microstructure on the hydrogen absorption rate will be discussed as well. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

The TOH-CN was proved to have an internal donor-acceptor heterostructure that could promote interfacial charge separation and transport, while the oxygen substitution effect modulated the nanoribbon morphology with increased surface/edge active sites and tuned the electronic structure to extend visible-light absorption as well as to improve band structure alignment. Benefiting from these advantages, the TOH-CN served as an efficient bifunctional photocatalyst for both H(2)and O(2)evolution under visible-light irradiation, exhibiting a 16 times higher photocatalytic H(2)evolution rate than that of its melon-based carbon nitride (g-C3N4) counterpart, and a remarkable apparent quantum yield of 7.9% at 420 nm. The O(2)evolution rate was 6 times higher than that of g-C3N4, even much higher than those of most bifunctional carbon nitride-based photocatalysts. The developed synergistic strategy of oxygen substitution and heterostructure construction will provide an alternative route for the synthesis of efficient polymeric semiconductors toward efficient solar-to-chemical conversion.									19	3	0	0	0	0	19			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000545253700021	32555851

However, searching for cheap and efficient HER electrocatalysts to replace the currently used Pt-based catalysts remains an urgent task. Herein, we develop a one-step carbon nanotube (CNT) assisted synthesis strategy with CNTs strong adsorbability to mediate the growth of subnanometer-sized MoSx on CNTs. The subnanometer MoSx-CNT hybrids achieve a low overpotential of 106 mV at 10 mA cm(-2), a small Tafel slope of 37 mV per decade, and an unprecedentedly high turnover frequency value of 18.84 s(-1) at eta = 200 mV among all reported non-Pt catalysts in acidic conditions. The superior performance of the hybrid catalysts benefits from the presence of a higher number of active sites and the abundant exposure of unsaturated S atoms rooted in the subnanometer structure, demonstrating a new class of subnanometer-scale catalysts.									61	7	0	0	3	0	63			1944-8244			WOS:000370211400074	26765150

We include the effect of re-accretion of material ejected during the nova outbursts of the semi-detached phase of evolution. We use the recent results of Prialnik & Kovetz (1995), concerning the effect of accretion onto a carbon-oxygen white dwarf. These calculations have now been followed by further calculations (Kovetz & Prialnik, 1997) aimed at obtaining the detailed break-up of the isotopic abundances in the ejecta. Our models give us the detailed composition of the secondary star throughout its whole evolution, since we use an extended nuclear reaction network. Using the data concerning the isotopic and element abundances of the surface of the secondary star, we show how the ratios of C-12/C-13, N-14/N-15 and O-16/O-17 and the abundances of C and N are affected by re-accretion of ejecta material.

The development of efficient ORR electrocatalyst is highly desirable to achieve the fast oxygen reduction. In this work, the bimetallic Cu and Co embedded nitrogen-doped carbon (CuCo-N/C) is fabricated as efficient electrocatalyst for ORR. The incorporation of Cu-precursor into Co-based zeolitic imidazolate frameworks (ZIF) is innovated here to synergistically enhance the activity of Co. Surprisingly, the addition of Cu can also increase the nitrogen content in the CuCo-N/C catalysts, which could generate more active sites and result in the improvement of ORR activity. The optimized CuCo-N/C catalysts exhibit superior ORR performance with a half-wave potential of 0.85 V (vs. RHE), a limiting current density of 5.61 mA cm(-2) and enhanced long-term durability comparing with the state-of-the-art Pt/C catalysts. Benefiting from the unique structure, the as-made CuCo-N/C catalysts as electrode for Zn-air battery delivers excellent performance with a peak power density of 66.9 mW cm(-2), a high open circuit voltage of 1.468 V, and a voltage degradation of about 1.4% after 12 h discharging, which is much better than that of Pt/C catalysts.

The Fe3O4 (111) surface was exposed to CCl4 molecules at 224 K, slowly annealed to 500 K (0.2 K/s), and scanned at room temperature. Two different chlorine species were observed only on the iron-terminated Fe3O4 (111) 2 x 2 surface due to chemisorption of CCl4, one on top of surface-terminating iron atoms (Cl bound to surface irons) and the other at 3-fold oxygen vacancy sites (Cl bound to subsurface irons). The ratio of the number of chlorine species on top sites to the number at 3-fold oxygen vacancy sites is approximately 9:1, which is dramatically different from the 1:10 ratio observed when CCl4 is dosed at room temperature. The difference in the ratio of these two chlorine species can be explained with a competitive surface reaction picture in which phosgene evolution/surface oxygen atom abstraction, leading to chlorine species at 3-fold oxygen vacancy sites, can only favorably compete with recombination and association reactions, leading to chlorine atoms on top sites, near room temperature. Theoretical calculations were performed that predict an activation barrier of 0.16 eV for the production of phosgene from CCl4 reacting with the iron-terminated Fe3O4 (111) 2 x 2 surface.									18	0	0	0	1	0	18			1520-6106			WOS:000224685600026

This paper describes the discovery of distorting FeO6 octahedra in La1-xCexFeO3 (x = 0, 0.25 0.5, 0.75, 1) orthorhombic perovskites for the promotion of lattice oxygen activation. By combined electrical conductivity relaxation measurements and density functional theory calculations studies, this paper describes the enhancement of FeO6 octahedral distortion in La1-xCexFeO3 promoting their bulk oxygen mobility and surface oxygen exchange capability. Consequently, LaosCeasFeO(3) with the highest FeO6 distortion achieves exceptional syngas productivity of similar to 3 and 8 times higher than LaFeO(3)( )and CeFeO3, respectively, in CH4 partial oxidation step with simultaneous high CO2 conversion (92%) in the CO2-splitting step at 850 degrees C. The results exemplify the feasibility to tailor the active lattice oxygen of perovskite by modulating the distortion of BO6 in ABO(3), which ultimately influences their reaction performance in chemical looping processes.									80	6	0	0	6	0	82			0002-7863	1520-5126		WOS:000547329800026	32492329

Nanostructure engineering is demonstrated as an effective approach for improving the catalytic activity of the materials. The mechanism for the enhancement, nevertheless, is still not fully understood. In this study, it is demonstrated that compressive strain can be introduced into freestanding perovskite cobaltite La0.8Sr0.2CoO3-delta (LSC) nanofibers with sufficient small size. Crystal structure analysis suggests that the LSC fiber is characterized by compressive strain along the ab plane and less distorted CoO6 octahedron compared to the bulk powder sample. Accompanied by such structural changes, the nanofiber shows significantly higher oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activity and better stability at elevated temperature, which is attributed to the higher oxygen vacancy concentration and suppressed Sr segregation in the LSC nanofibers. First-principle calculations further suggest that the compressive strain in LSC nanofibers effectively shortens the distance between the Co 3d and O 2p band center and lowers the oxygen vacancy formation energy. The results clarify the critical role of surface stress in determining the intrinsic activity of perovskite oxide nanomaterials. The results of this work can help guide the design of highly active and durable perovskite catalysts via nanostructure engineering.									5	0	0	0	1	0	4			1613-6810	1613-6829		WOS:000703008200001	34605170

However, the role of local adsorbed carboxylate ligands around the in-situ-transformed metal (oxy)hydroxides during OER is often overlooked. We reveal the extraordinary role and mechanism of surface-adsorbed carboxylate ligands on bi/trimetallic layered double hydroxides (LDHs)/MOFs for OER electrocatalytic activity enhancement. The results of X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), synchrotron X-ray absorption spectroscopy, and density functional theory (DFT) calculations show that the carboxylic groups around metal (oxy)hydroxides can efficiently induce interfacial electron redistribution, facilitate an abundant high-valence state of nickel species with a partially distorted octahedral structure, and optimize the d-band center together with the beneficial Gibbs free energy of the intermediate. Furthermore, the results of in situ Raman and FTIR spectra reveal that the surface-adsorbed carboxylate ligands as Lewis base can promote sluggish OER kinetics by accelerating proton transfer and facilitating adsorption, activation, and dissociation of hydroxyl ions (OH-).									72	3	0	0	5	0	74			1433-7851	1521-3773		WOS:000669574200001	33982379

Herein, we fabricated the series of nitrogen doped carbon (NC) and CoFe-NC core-shell architectures to produce dual-functionality towards oxygen reduction/evolution reactions and ultimately for Zn-air battery. The addition of NC tends to prevent the reduction of Co/Fe nanoparticles during pyrolysis which not only provide improved catalytic sites but also boost the specific surface area, graphitization degree, electron and mass transfer capacity. With distinctive core-shell morphology, the as synthesized CoFe-NC/NC shows superior OER performance with low overpotential (270 mV) than IrO2 (340 mV) at 10 mA cm(-2) and nearly close ORR activity with respect to Pt/C. When fabricated as zinc air battery application, CoFe-NC/NC shows 58 mW cm(-2) higher peak power density than that of air cathodes made of Pt/C and IrO2. Further, our catalyst shows good durability due to the synergistic effect of Fe/Co and NC shell. (C) 2020 Elsevier Inc.

Effective candidates for HER are often based on noble metals or transition metal dichalcogenides, while carbon-based metal-free electrocatalysts generally demonstrate poorer activity. Here we report evaluation of a series of heteroatom-doped graphene materials as efficient HER electrocatalysts by combining spectroscopic characterization, electrochemical measurements, and density functional theory calculations. Results of theoretical computations are shown to be in good agreement with experimental observations regarding the intrinsic electrocatalytic activity and the HER reaction mechanism. As a result, we establish a HER activity trend for graphene-based materials, and explore their reactivity origin to guide the design of more efficient electrocatalysts. We predict that by rationally modifying particular experimentally achievable physicochemical characteristics, a practically realizable graphene-based material will have the potential to exceed the performance of the metal-based benchmark for HER.									753	32	0	0	57	0	752			2058-7546			WOS:000394786100001

Crystal engineering strategies involving the target morphology, specific crystal phase and orientation, as well as the local atomic structure have proven to be promising for future batteries, supercapacitors or electrocatalysts. In this perspective, we summarized the recent progress in crystal engineering of transition metal based electrocatalysts for efficient hydrogen generation via water splitting.									18	0	0	0	0	0	18				1466-8033		WOS:000526761000004

Herein, we report a facile solvothermal method to prepare ultrafine cobalt phosphide (CoPx)-doped Co-based zeolitic imidazole framework (CoPx/ZIF-67). The one-pot synthesis of CoPx/ZIF-67 involves an oxygen-free sealed room-temperature reaction, in which the high chemical activity of rich defect sits in 2D black phosphorus quantum dots (BPQDs) endows edge-selective coordination/reduction of Co ions. Carbonization of CoPx/ZIF-67 at 800 degrees C can produce CoPx-N-doped porous carbon composites (CoPx-NPC). The as-prepared CoPx-NPC retains the intrinsic morphology of rhombic dodecahedrons, similar to that of NPC derived from ZIF-67. The ultrafine CoPx doping causes chemical and electronic modulation and offers more active electrocatalytic sites etc., so that CoPx-NPC possesses enhanced ORR performance in terms of positive onset-potential (similar to -0.06 V vs. SCE), large diffusion limiting current density (- 4.703 mA cm(-2)), high stability, as well as the accelerated reaction kinetics.									14	0	0	0	2	0	14			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000458482100008

Through the water-splitting reaction of PSII, light energy is converted into biologically useful chemical energy, and molecular oxygen is formed which transformed the atmosphere into an aerobic one and sustained aerobic life on the Earth. The PSII core complex from cyanobacteria consists of 17 transmembrane subunits and 3 extrinsic subunits with a total molecular mass of approximately 350kDa per monomer, and PSII exists predominately in a dimeric form in vivo. This chapter describes the purification procedures leading to highly pure, homogenous, and highly active PSII core dimers from a thermophilic cyanobacterium, Thermosynechococcus vulcanus (T. vulcanus), that are used for successful crystallization and diffraction at atomic resolution. The purity and homogeneity of the PSII dimers thus obtained are characterized by absorption spectra, low-temperature fluorescence spectra, SDS-PAGE, clear native PAGE, blue native PAGE, gel filtration chromatography, and oxygen-evolving activity measurements. Finally, high-quality crystals obtained from the purified PSII dimers are shown.									9	0	0	0	7	0	9			0076-6879		978-0-12-816361-0	WOS:000452369600002	30509462

Group VIII transition metal phosphides (TMPs) gradually stand out due to their intriguing properties including low resistance and superior catalytic activity and stability. Herein, we adopt a unique MOF-derived strategy to synthesize transition metal phosphide nanoboxes which can be employed as electrocatalysts for the hydrogen evolution reaction. During this process, we converted a Co-MOF to a CoNi-MOF by ion exchange and low-temperature phosphating to achieve CoNiP nanoboxes.

The growth of the ORR products on the electrode surface, which was mainly assigned to lithium peroxide (Li2O2), was directly confirmed by the ECAFM. It was found that the water concentration in the solution significantly affects the morphology of the ORR products. The growth of anisotropic Li2O2 particles on the gold electrode surface has been confirmed to be an electrochemical process. No evidence was found to support the disproportionation growth mechanism. These ORR. products were fully decomposed at a potential as high as 4.4 V (vs Li+/Li) in the subsequent OER process, more positive than that determined by a surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) measurement. Combined with infrared absorption spectroscopy and SERS measurements, we propose that the oxidation decomposition of the Li2O2 deposits first occurs at its interface with the gold electrode surface, while that of the remaining particles takes place at a higher overpotential. On the contrary, the ORR deposits could be fully decomposed at a potential as low as 3.6 V when tetrathiafulvalene (TTF) was included in the solution. We confirmed by EC-AFM that the electrochemically generated TTF+ can mediate the decomposition of the Li2O2 at a lower potential through a homogeneous oxidation mechanism.									43	1	0	0	2	0	43			1932-7447			WOS:000387737900010

K.; Patil, Satish; Shukla, Ashok					Patil, Satish/0000-0003-3884-114X			Effect of binary additives on performance of the undivided soluble-lead-redox-flow battery								ELECTROCHIMICA ACTA				365						137361	10.1016/j.electacta.2020.137361				JAN 1 2021	2021	Cycle-life of Soluble-Lead-Redox-Flow-Batteries (SLRFBs) is impacted due to formation of lead dendrites at anode and oxygen evolution at cathode. In this regard, addition of certain surfactants to the electrolyte helps preventing dendrite formation while adding fluoride salts reduces the rate of oxygen evolution reaction. Since SLRFB has a common electrolyte, understanding the combined effect of such additives on individual electrodes as well as on the overall SLRFB performance is desirable, which is lacking in the literature. Accordingly, in the present study, the combined effect of sodium lignosulfonate (SLS) and sodium fluoride (NaF) additives on the overall cell performance, individual electrodes, electrode kinetics, crystallographic phase formation, and surface morphology of electrodeposits is reported. The electrochemical data on SLRFB are analyzed in the light of electrode-kinetic parameters, namely limiting current-density, exchange current-density and Tafel-slope. The study reveals that adding NaF additive enhances the kinetics of Pb/Pb2+ and Pb2+/Pb4+ redox couples as compared to the pristine electrolyte or with SLS additive. The exchange current-density is higher with NaF additive as compared to NaF and SLS binary combined additive. It is also observed from cyclic voltammograms that the peak current decreases in the presence of binary additive indicating sluggish electrode kinetics. SEM images and galvanostatic charge-discharge studies suggest that binary additive results in uniform electrodeposit which improves the cycle-life of SLRFB. (c) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

In this report, a Fe-Co-hollow porous nanocarbon material derived from Fe-modified bimetallic zeolitic-imidazole frameworks (ZIFs) has been demonstrated. Owing to the unique 3-dimensional interconnected hollow porous carbon structure of the developed material and the synergetic effect of the corresponding bimetallic system, it shows good bifunctional oxygen electrocatalytic properties. Compare to the commercial 20% Pt/C and IrO2 or RuO2, the half-wave potential of oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) of the developed catalyst reaches 0.81 V (vs. RHE) (Pt/C is 0.84 V vs. RHE), and the overpotential of oxygen evolution reaction (OER) at 10 mA/cm(2) is 0.43 V vs. RHE (the overpotential of RuO2 of 0.4 V vs. RHE). When the rechargeable liquid Zn-air batteries are assembled with the catalysts as the cathode, it shows a power density of 100.2 mW/cm(2) and cycling stability of 2500 min, which are better compare to the commercial Pt/C-RuO2 (the power density and cycling stability of Pt/C-RuO2 is 99.2 mW/cm(2) and cycling stability of 2200 min, respectively). In addition, the open-circuit potential (OCP) of the produced rechargeable liquid and flexible solid-state ZABs reach up to 1.47 V and 1.45 V, respectively; also, the material exhibits good bending flexibility and stability. Overall, this development provides a new method for solid-state ZABs systems of MOF-derived carbon materials. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V.

Data of neutron diffraction and thermogravimetric analysis reveals that Pr deficiency causes generation of lattice oxygen vacancies on equatorial and apical sites but does not influence the concentration of interstitial oxygen. High-temperature X-ray diffraction shows for all materials a reversible orthorhombic-to-tetragonal phase transition with negligible hysteresis in the range similar to 400-450 degrees C, reducing tilting and twisting of the NiO6 octahedra. The phase transition temperature is found to decrease slightly with increasing A-site deficiency.

Herein, we show a surprisingly strong activation effect of black phosphorus (BP) on platinum (Pt) catalysts to give greatly enhanced catalytic activity in the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). The unique and negative binding energy between BP and Pt leads to spontaneous formation of Pt-P bonds producing strong synergistic ligand effects on the Pt nanoparticles. No Pt-P bonds are formed with red phosphorus which is another allotrope of P. By controlling the number of Pt-P bonds, 3.5-fold enhancement in the HER activity can be achieved from the BP-activated Pt catalyst and the activity is 6.1 times higher than that of the state-of-the-art commercial Pt/C catalyst. The BP-activated Pt catalyst exhibits a current density of 82.89 mA cm(-2) with only 1 mu g of Pt in 1 m KOH at an overpotential of 70 mV.									59	8	0	0	7	0	61			1433-7851	1521-3773		WOS:000494626800001	31589358

CoPi layers with sufficient thickness were found to reduce the potential required for TEMPO oxidation by 0.5 V, as well as increase charge injection efficiency sevenfold compared to BiVO4 without CoPi. Furthermore, the undesired OER was completely suppressed when using the heterostructured photoanodes. Transient photocurrent measurements suggested that CoPi alleviates recombination losses resulting from the back reduction of oxidized TEMPO. The PECs with BiVO4/CoPi bilayer achieved 88 % yield to 2,5-furandicarboxylic acid (FDCA) from HMF oxidation under mild conditions, whereas <1 % FDCA was generated with BiVO4. These findings suggest that suppression of the back reduction process substantially improves the efficiency of the oxidation, giving a potential route to more efficient solar fuel/chemical production.									24	2	0	0	2	0	24			2196-0216			WOS:000475512500021

Thus, the development of high-performance and economical catalysts has been extensively investigated. In this study, a nanoporous Mo carbide electrode is prepared using a top-down electrochemical process and it is applied as an electrocatalyst for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Anodic oxidation of Mo foil followed by heat treatment in a carbon monoxide (CO) atmosphere forms a nanostructured Mo carbide with excellent interconnections, and these structural characteristics lead to high activity and durability when applied to the HER. Additionally, characteristic behavior of Mo is observed; metallic Mo nanosheets form during electrochemical anodization by exfoliation along the (110) planes. These nanosheets are viable for chemical modification, indicating their feasibility in various applications. Moreover, the role of carbon shells is investigated on the surface of the electrocatalysts, whereby it is suggested that carbon shells serve as a mechanical barrier against the oxidative degradation of catalysts that accompanies unavoidable volume expansion.									43	1	0	0	1	0	43			2198-3844			WOS:000422658700021	29375978

Here reported is a promising method to synthesize SACs on highly conductive multiwall carbon nanotube (MWCNT) supports using pulsed laser confinement (PLC) process in liquid. Atomic cobalt (Co) and phosphorus (P) with a high loading density are homogeneously incorporated on the outer wall of the MWCNT (Co-P SAC MWCNT). Density functional theory (DFT) calculations in combination with systematic control experiments found that the incorporated Co and P adatoms act as an adsorption energy optimizer and a charge transfer promoter, respectively. Hence, favorable kinetics and thermodynamics in Co-P SAC MWCNT can be simultaneously achieved for water oxidation resulting in a superior catalytic performance than the benchmark RuO2 catalyst. Crucially, total processing time for assembling Co-P SAC MWCNT via PLC process is less than 60 min, shedding light on the promising practical applications of our SAC design strategy.									14	0	0	0	1	0	14			1936-0851	1936-086X		WOS:000634569100060	33577733

However, the paste of [Hbet][TFSA]-PbSO4 coated on screen-printed carbon electrode (SPCE) could be electrochemically converted to Pb or PbO2 in aqueous 0.1 M KCl via constant-potential electrolysis for the former and continuous cyclic voltammetry in 0.1 M NaOH for the latter. The formation of PbO2, which could be converted to CoOx (containing Co3O4) through galvanic displacement in a Co(NO3)(2) aqueous solution, was verified with Raman scattering spectroscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS); the latter also verified the formation of Co3O4. The CoOx-modified electrode showed activity and high stability towards the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in alkaline solutions. The approach shown in this study can be further developed as a procedure for extracting Pb metal or preparing CoOx catalysts from wastes, such as the discarded lead-storage batteries.									14	1	0	0	1	0	14			1572-6657	1873-2569		WOS:000457507900009

Two-dimensional (2D) materials with a unique band structure and surface conformation have emerged as promising electrocatalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). However, the intrinsic activities of primitive 2D materials in the catalytic process are still inferior to those of noble metal-based electrocatalysts. Surface defect engineering can modulate the electronic structure of 2D materials and induce new physicochemical properties, promoting their electrocatalytic performance. Herein, this minireview focuses on some recent developments in surface defect engineering, including the contribution of active sites, the derivation of the heterogeneous interface, and the anchoring of active substances, which provides an effective way to further optimize 2D electrocatalysts for water splitting. Furthermore, the typical morphological characteristics, catalytic activity, stability and catalytic mechanism of these 2D electrocatalysts are introduced. We believe that this minireview will help design more efficient and economical electrocatalysts for overall water splitting.									14	1	0	0	0	0	14			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000612999200010	33444426

Precious metal electrocatalysts had excellent electrocatalytic activity. However, its limited resources and high price limited its large-scale application. Therefore, the design of efficient, stable and low-cost non-precious metal electrocatalysts has become the key to improving HER efficiency. Herein, we synthesized two cobalt and nickel-based Metal-Organic Frameworks (MOFs), [Ni(bib)(2)(SO4)](n) (Ni-MOF) and [Co(bib)(2)(SO4)](n) (Co-MOF) using bib as a ligand (bib = 1,4-bis(1-imidazolyl)benzene). Ni-MOF-T or Co-MOF-T was obtained by high-temperature calcination under the nitrogen atmosphere. Ni-MOF-800 or Co-MOF-800 exhibited high electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution activity. Besides, the electrocatalytic performance of Co-MOF@Zn-800 obtained by doping zinc ions in Co-MOF was improved.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0277-5387	1873-3719		WOS:000844304400008		
J	Zhang, Xiuhong; Shen, Weilin; Li, Zheng; Wang, Dong; Qi, Ji; Liang, Changhai								Carbon-based active support for water oxidation electrocatalyst: Making full use of the available surface area								CARBON				167				548	558		10.1016/j.carbon.2020.06.022				OCT 15 2020	2020	Since the support of conventional electrocatalysts is mostly inert, certain parts of these supported electrocatalysts that have direct contact with the reactants do not have electrocatalytic function. Therefore, the surface area of these electrocatalysts is larger than their electrochemically active surface area. So as to make full use of the available surface area and release the activity potential of the electrocatalysts, this work synthesized a carbon-based active support with certain electrocatalytic activity for water oxidation reaction, providing a general route to prepare electrocatalysts with electrochemically active surface area close to their surface area. In detail, a cubic core-shell support was synthesized via an aqueous phase synthesis method for oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The carbon-based active support with a larger specific surface area (306 m(2) g(-1)) is beneficial to the dispersion of the active sites. The support has appropriate OER catalytic activity which can synergistically catalyze OER together with NiFe (oxy)hydroxide on it during the reaction. Under the current density of 10 mA cm(2), the overpotential is as low as 214 mV for OER, which is better than those of most non-precious metal catalysts, suggesting that carbon-based active support could effectively reduce energy consumption via promoting surface area utilization ratio.

Though having the merits of high earth abundance, easy availability, and tunable composition, transition-metal oxides are usually deemed as poor electrocatalysts for HER. Herein, we demonstrate that doping beta-CoMoO4 nanoplates with phosphorus can turn them into active electrocatalysts for HER Theoretical calculation and experimental studies unravel that enhanced electrical conductivity and optimized hydrogen adsorption free energy are major causes for the improvement of intrinsic activity. As a result, only an overpotential of 138 mV is required to drive hydrogen evolving at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) in 1 M KOH for P-doped beta-CoMoO4, which outstrips many recently reported transition-metal oxides and is just slightly inferior to commercial Pt/C. This work opens a new route to tune the HER performance of transition-metal oxides.									59	7	0	0	1	0	59			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000449239600050	30285410

The highly active and durable oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalysts play a decisive factor in achieving efficient water splitting. The identification of authentic active origin under the service conditions can prompt a more reasonable design of catalysts together with well-confined micro-/nano-structures to boost the efficiency of water splitting. Herein, Fe, Co, and Ni ternary transition metal dichalcogenide (FCND) nanorod arrays on Ni foam are purposely designed as an active and stable low-cost OER pre-catalyst for the electrolysis of water in alkaline media. The optimized FCND catalyst demonstrated a lower overpotential than the binary and unary counterparts, and a 27-fold rise in kinetic current density at the overpotential of 300 mV compared to the nickel dichalcogenide counterpart. Raman spectra and other structural characterizations at different potentials reveal that the in situ surface self-reconstruction from FCND to ternary transition metal oxyhydroxides (FCNOH) on catalyst surfaces initiated at about 1.5 V, which is identified as the origin of OER activity. The surface self-reconstruction towards FCNOH also enables excellent stability, without fading upon the test for 50 h.

Homogeneous anchoring of MoO2 nanoparticles on nitrogen-doped graphene was achieved for the composite synthesized at 500 A degrees C (MoO2/NG-500). For the first time, the MoO2/NG composite manifests considerable electrocatalytic activity for ORR in alkaline solution, with the onset potential of 0.91 V and the peak potential of 0.73 V. Furthermore, the MoO2/NG catalyst outperforms commercial Pt/C catalyst in terms of the electrochemical durability for ORR. The facile fabrication, reasonable ORR activity and excellent stability endow our MoO2/NG catalyst with great promise in application of cost-effective fuel cells.									7	0	0	0	0	0	7			0022-2461	1573-4803		WOS:000423711900041

Thus, developing catalysts that are more active than Pt for these two reactions is important for advancing the performance of anion exchange membrane fuel cells and water electrolyzers. Herein, we detail a 4-fold enhancement of Pt mass activity that we achieved using single-crystalline Ru@Pt core-shell nanoparticles with two-monolayer-thick Pt shells, which doubles the activity on Pt-Ru alloy nanocatalysts. For Pt specific activity, the two- and one-monolayer-thick Pt shells exhibited enhancement factors of 3.1 and 2.3, respectively, compared to the Pt nanocatalysts in base, differing considerably from the values of 1 and 0.4, respectively, in acid. To explain such behavior and the orders of magnitude difference in activity on going from acid to base, we performed kinetic analyses of polarization curves over a wide range of potential from -250 to 250 mV using the dual-pathway kinetic equation. From acid to base, the activation free energies increase the most for the Volmer reaction, resulting in a switch of the rate-determining step from the Tafel to the Volmer reaction, and a shift to a weaker optimal hydrogen binding energy. The much higher activation barrier for the Volmer reaction in base than in acid is ascribed to one or both of the two catalyst-insensitive factors: slower transport of OH- than H+ in water and a stronger O-H bond in water molecules (HO-H) than in hydrated protons (H2O-H+).									151	8	0	0	6	0	154			2155-5435			WOS:000364441300065

However, BiVO4 faces limitations, such as the inefficient separation and transportation of photogenerated charges in the bulk and poor catalytic water oxidation reactions at the surface that affect the water-splitting efficiency. In this work, the Cs intercalation strategy at the surface of BiVO4 is proposed for the enhanced water splitting to H-2 and O-2 productions via the effective separation and transportation photogenerated charges and improved surface catalytic water oxidation reactions. The Cs ions are found to intercalate at the surface of BiVO4 and regulate the oxygen vacancies to provide active O-2 production sites and stability. The surface intercalation of Cs boosts the photocurrent to 1.89 mA cm(-2) at 1.23 V vs. reference hydrogen electrode (RHE). A stoichiometric evolution of H-2 and O-2 is recorded with a faradaic efficiency of 92%. The open-circuit voltage measurements confirmed the increase in the carrier lifetime with the work function tuning upon Cs intercalation. The proposed Cs intercalation strategy suggests an effective route to suppress the charge recombination with an increase in carrier lifetime and charge separation in BiVO(4 )for the enhanced PEC application.

Here, we developed a simple method to prepare a thin NiOOH layer on the surface of BiVO4 nanorod arrays. The heterostructured photoanode shows great enhancement for the photocurrent density of 2.7 mA cm(-2) at 1.23 V vs. RHE, which is similar to 2.3 times higher than that of pristine BiVO4 electrode, due to NiOOH as an efficient oxygen-releasing catalyst with abundant oxygen vacancies. The NiOOH/BiVO4 photoanodes are systematically studied with X-ray diffraction, Raman, X-ray photoelectron spectra, scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, and UV-vis diffuse-reflectance spectrum. The heterostructured photoanode shows excellent PEC activity, which can provide a promising and easy strategy to prepare such photoanode with high-efficient oxygen evolution co-catalysts.

Here we report a facile and general strategy for synthesizing a noble-metal-free electrocatalyst consisting of graphdiyne (GDY)-encapsulated cerium/nickel layered double-hydroxide nanosheets (CeNiLDH@GDY) with a remarkable OER performance. Experimental results demonstrate that the remarkable synergistic effects among different components in the catalyst confer to the catalyst great advantages for combining activity and stability towards an excellent OER performance. The optimal electrocatalyst (Ce0.6Ni0.4LDH@GDY) shows excellent OER performances with a small overpotential of 283 mV to reach 10 mA cm(-2) and a high long-term stability over 60 h at around 15 mA cm(-2) with almost no decrease in current density. Our results show that the in situ growth of graphdiyne on the LDH surface can form an ideal interface structure leading to an increase in the active surface area and the number of active sites, promoting the charge transfer behavior, protecting the catalyst from corrosion, and consequently enhancing the catalytic performances. This work provides a general method for the design and fabrication of highly active and stable electrocatalysts with desired active site structures for water splitting.									13	4	0	0	0	0	14				2052-1537		WOS:000639429500001

A descriptor-based approach to estimate the ORR activity of binary surface alloys, wherein alloying occurs only in the surface layer, is described, and rigorous, potential-dependent computational tests of the stability of these alloys in aqueous, acidic environments are presented. These activity and stability criteria are applied to a database of DFT calculations on nearly 750 binary transition metal surface alloys; of these, many are predicted to be active for the ORR but, with few exceptions, they are found to be thermodynamically unstable in the acidic environments typical of low-temperature fuel cells. The results suggest that, absent other thermodynamic or kinetic mechanisms to stabilize the alloys, surface alloys are unlikely to serve as useful ORR catalysts over extended periods of operation.									210	3	0	0	13	0	212			1932-7447			WOS:000264349100032

However, their inferior charge transfer ability constrains further performance improvement. In this work, a facile strategy is reported to fabricate Co2P/Ni2P/carbon nanotube (CNT) composite from a precursor Co-Ni Prussian blue analogue. The combination of Co2P/Ni2P and CNT endows Co2P/Ni2P/CNT with improved electrical conductivity and a richer electrochemically active surface area. As a result, the Co2P/Ni2P/CNT composite exhibits desirable HER activities across a wide pH range, delivering a benchmark current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at overpotentials as low as 151 and 202 mV in 0.5 M H2SO4 and 1 M KOH electrolytes, respectively, as well as remarkable electrocatalytic stabilities over 48 h in both electrolytes. This strategy enables the design of high-performance electrocatalysts for efficient and stable hydrogen generation. (C) 2022 Elsevier Inc.

The turnover frequencies (TOFs) of 0.55 and 4.1 s(-1) at an overpotential of 100 and 200 mV also confirm their remarkable performance. DFT calculations reveal that the surface dopants abnormally sensitize surface Ni-3d bands in the long-range order towards higher electron-transfer activity, acting as the electron-depletion center. Meanwhile, the high lying surface S-sites possess substantially high selectivity for splitting the adsorbing H2O that guarantee the high HER performance within alkaline conditions.

This allows to mitigate a high overvoltage of oxygen evolution reaction with respect to thermodynamic E-O2/H2O(0) = 1.23 V potential as well as spectrally narrow absorbtivity of solar light by TiO2 which determine the low efficiency (similar to 1.0%) of direct light-to-chemical energy conversion.

Morphological investigation of p-Cof reveals the presence of assemblies of highly porous flat carbon blocks. p-Cof exhibits a high surface area (1213 m(2) g(-1)) and a wide range of micro-and mesopores with good electrical conductivity. Along with this, the surface of p-Cof displays the presence of graphitic and pyridone-type nitrogen coordinations, which help p-Cof to perform as a multifunctional catalyst as revealed from its catalytic activities towards photocatalytic hydrogen production (PHP) and electrocatalytic oxygen reduction reactions. p-Cof produces 334 mu mol h(-1) g(-1) of hydrogen from water under visible light and 575 mmol h(-1) g(-1) of hydrogen under solar light irradiation with excellent stability. Along with this, p-Cof also displays improved oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activity in alkaline medium. A better onset potential (0.91 V vs. RHE) and half-wave potential (0.75 V vs. RHE) are displayed by p-Cof compared to the catalyst derived from the simple annealing of CBW without employing the silica template. Along with the better electrochemical activity, p-Cof shows excellent ORR kinetics and electrochemical stability compared to the current state-of-the-art Pt/C.									17	1	0	0	0	0	18				2046-2069		WOS:000382776000083

The electrochemical performance of AF/Pb-0.6 wt%Ag anode and traditional Pb-0.6 wt%Ag anode after 72 h galvanostatic polarization in 160 g/L H2SO4 solution was investigated comparatively by chronopotentiometry (CP), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and Tafel measurements.

Moreover, the AF/Pb-0.6 wt%Ag anode shows a lower stable anodic potential, which is consistent with higher PbO2, lower PbO, PbO center dot PbSO4 content and R-ct, value obtained by CP and EIS Measurements. It is also revealed that the AF/Pb-0.6 wt%Ag anode possesses a better oxygen evolution reaction (OER).									3	1	0	0	0	0	3			1002-185X			WOS:000449442900014

In this work, from the perspective of defect engineering and morphology regulation, we found that abundant defects could be created in the NiCo-LDH by applying a novel template method to construct a hollow nanocage morphology. The rich defects in the hollow cage NiCo-LDH (HC-NiCo-LDH) were demonstrated by X-ray absorption fine structure (XAFS) experiments to be oxygen and metal vacancies. Remarkably, the HC-NiCo-LDH showed excellent CO2 photoreduction performance; the CH4 selectivity was increased from 8.92% to 62.66%, while the side reaction of H-2 evolution was suppressed from 44.92% to barely 1.77%, as compared with the defect-free bulk counterparts. The DFT + U calculations and experimental results simultaneously revealed that these defects caused a decreased bandgap to improve the photoinduced electron-hole pair separation efficiency and to facilitate charge transfer processes. This work provides defect-level insights into the NiCo-LDH hollow morphology, providing fundamental guidance to improve the activity and selectivity of photocatalytic CO2 reduction.									14	0	0	0	2	0	14			2052-1553			WOS:000621124100012

At high current densities, issues in the catalyst layer (CL, composed of catalyst and ionomer), like oxygen transfer, water balance, and microstructural evolution, play important roles in the performance. In addition, CLs for AEMFCs have different requirements than for PEMFCs, such as chemical/physical stability, reaction mechanism, and mass transfer, because of different conductive media and pH environment. The anion exchange ionomer (AEI), which is the soluble or dispersed analogue of the anion exchange membrane (AEM), is required for hydroxide transport in the CL and is normally handled separately with the electrocatalyst during the electrode fabrication process. The importance of the AEI-catalyst interface in maximizing the utilization of electrocatalyst and fuel/oxygen transfer process must be carefully investigated. This review briefly covers new concepts in the complex AEMFC catalyst layer, before a detailed discussion on advances in CLs based on the design of AEIs and electrocatalysts. The importance of the structure-function relationship is highlighted with the aim of directing the further development of CLs for high-performance AEMFC.									19	1	0	0	1	0	19				2198-3844		WOS:000653502300001	34032021

The introduction of Ag into a common grid alloy of Pb-Ca-Sn-Al confers some important features on the alloy. Potentiodynamic anodic polarisation measurements provided a qualitative overview of the activating, passivating and transpassivating processes which correspond to Pb --> PbSO4, PbSO4 --> PbO2 reactions respectively. Cyclic voltammetric measurements provided information on the effect of Ag on the oxidation of PbSO4 to PbO2. The addition of Ag refined the grains and enhanced the passivation of the electrode and its corrosion resistance. A decrease in the oxygen evolution overpotential and an increase in the hydrogen evolution overpotential with the additions of AE were also observed during the experiments.									13	4	0	0	1	0	17			0021-891X			WOS:000078971700001

Herein, via an electrospinning method, one-dimensional (1D) carbon fibers containing MIL-53 (Fe) and Co3+ are obtained as precursor for preparation of Fe3C/CoFe2O4- embedded carbon nanofibers (Fe3C/CoFe2O4@CNFs). Scanning electron microscopy image of Fe3C/ CoFe2O4@CNFs-1.5 (mass ratio of MIL-53(Fe) to CoCl3 center dot 6H(2)O is 1.5) shows that it has a well-formed 1D structure with diameters of 200-300 nm. Hydrophilic surface with a contact angle of 16.5 degrees is detected for Fe3C/ CoFe2O4@CNFs-1.5 (250.1 m(2) g(-1)), which shows a promising bifunctional activity with Delta E = 0.73 V (E-1/2 = 0.84 V (ORR) and E-j10 = 1.57 V (OER)). For ORR, E1/2 of Fe3C/CoFe2O4@CNFs-1.5 is close to that of commercial Pt/C (0.85 V), while its activity maintenance (92.5%) is much better than Pt/C (78.4%) after 30000 s, indicating that low-valence interfaces of CoFe2O4 (Co2+) and Fe3C (Fe2+) can provide multiple active sites to stabilize ORR rate. For OER, Fe3C/CoFe2O4@CNFs-1.5 has a low overpotential of 340 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) and a high Faraday efficiency of 92.13%. Co2+ acts as an initiator to boost the formation of active CoOOH for OER. Oxygen vacancies on the reverse spinel structure of CoFe2O4 make the surface Co2+ easier to be oxidized to Co3+ (CoOOH). Fe3C/CoFe2O4 wrapped in carbon fiber lowers their aggregation and corrosion during ORR/OER. Networks constructed by the interconnected 1D nanofibers can provide 3D pathways for mass transfer. It indicates that bimetallic species (Fe/Co) can change the electronic and interface structures to promote bifunctional activity.									15	1	0	0	3	0	15			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000704481600006

One important stellar reaction is C-12+C-12, but it is difficult to measure it in the Gamow window because of very low cross sections and several resonances occurring. Hints can be obtained from the study of C-13+C-12 reaction. We have measured this process by an activation method for energies down to E-cm=2.5 MeV using C-13 beams from the Bucharest 3 MV tandetron and gamma-ray deactivation measurements in our low and ultralow background laboratories, the latter located in a salt mine about 100 km north of Bucharest. Results obtained so far are shown and discussed in connection with the possibility to go even further down in energy and with the interpretation of the reaction mechanism at such deep sub-barrier energies.					8th European Summer School on Experimental Nuclear Astrophysics (Santa Tecla School)8th European Summer School on Experimental Nuclear Astrophysics (Santa Tecla School)	SEP 13-20, 2015SEP 13-20, 2015	INFNINFN	Sicily, ITALYSicily, ITALY	5	0	0	0	0	0	5			1742-6588	1742-6596	*****************	WOS:000389583400028

The Fe@Fe3O4/CNT hybrids were first synthesized by annealing the CNTs adsorbed with Fe(NO3)(3), followed by controlled phosphorization treatment. They exhibit an outstanding catalytic activity for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) with a low overpotential of 229 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2), a high turnover frequency value of 0.35 at an overpotential of 300 mV, and an ultralow Tafel slope of 27.6 mV dec(-1), which is much better than that of FeP/Fe3O4, FeP/CNTs, Fe3O4/CNTs, and the commercial RuO2 electrocatalyst. More importantly, the Tafel slope is much lower than most non-noble metal-based OER electrocatalysts reported in the previous literature studies as far as we know. The excellent OER performance benefits from the electron transfer from Fe3O4 to FeP confirmed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, together with good conductivity of CNTs. This hybrid structure supported on conductive CNTs may offer an efficient method to design earth-abundant and low-cost electrocatalysts for OER in practical applications.									20	2	0	0	2	0	20			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000526543400041	32108463

Herein, we report the synthesis of Fe-N-C oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) electrocatalyst for fuel cell (FC) applications using carbonaceous char derived from scrap tires through microwave-assisted pyrolysis (MAP). The char obtained from MAP was activated with potassium hydroxide and then pyrolyzed at a high temperature to fabricate Fe-N-C after mixing with iron and nitrogen precursors. Finally, the developed Fe-N-C was ball-milled and acid-etched for homogenization and leaching of iron oxide nanoparticles. In this study, structural evaluation during each synthesis step was eluci-dated and correlated with the ORR activity in all three pHs i.e. acidic, neutral, and alkaline. Moreover, the effect of electrocatalyst loading on ORR kinetics was also analyzed using two different loadings (0.2 and 0.6 mg cm-2) on the rotating ring disk electrode (RRDE). The developed Fe-N-C demonstrated encouraging onset potentials of 0.881, 0.822, and 0.936 V vs RHE in acidic, neutral, and alkaline conditions, respectively. Whereas the ORR activity was slightly reduced after the milling-etching step. Lower peroxide yield together with a tetra-electronic reduction of oxygen was witnessed in acidic and neutral conditions, however, peroxide production was increased in the alkaline medium.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0013-4686	1873-3859		WOS:000870474300002

Although manganese compounds, oxides in particular, have drawn the most interest, they rarely deliver the same performance as the noble metals in oxygen electrocatalysis, notwithstanding the enhancements introduced by nanosizing and adjuvant metal doping. Herein, we report a noble-metal-like performance for manganese oxide catalysts by combining phosphate modification with a hollow nanostructure. A simple and scalable self-templating method based on phosphate-mediated Mn redox reactions was developed for the preparation of hollow phosphated manganese oxide nanospheres at room temperature. A series of simple (h-MnOxPy) and complex phosphated manganese oxide (h-Me-MnOxPy, Me = Co, Ni, Cu) hollow nanospheres can be produced more efficiently than normal hollow nanostructure construction techniques based on hard and soft templates and hydrothermal Ostwald ripening. Among the hollow phosphated manganese oxides h-MnOxP0.21 delivered the best ORR performance (half-wave potential of 0.85 V vs RHE, similar to 20 wt % Pt/C) and h-Co-MnOxP0.21 the best OER performance (1.60 V vs RHE for 10 mA cm(-2), marginally higher than 20 wt % Ir/C). Small charge-discharge voltage gaps (Delta V) were shown in both alkaline (Delta V= 0.72 Vat 5 mA cm(-2)) and neutral (Delta V= 1.28 V at 1 mA cm(-2)) rechargeable Zn-air batteries with the combined use of these catalysts, similar to the 20 wt % Pt/C + 20 wt % Ir/C combined catalytic systems.									25	1	0	0	2	0	25			0897-4756	1520-5002		WOS:000451789500019

Modelling of the transient behaviour of a membrane-attached biofilm reactor under successive pulses of a synthetic wastewater substrate								International Journal of Chemical Reactor Engineering				6				30 pp.	30 pp.						2008	2008	This work deals with the theoretical and experimental study of the transient behaviour of a membrane-attached biofilm reactor (MARB) when it is exposed to a series of pulse injections of concentrated solutions of sodium acetate, used as a synthetic wastewater. The MARB is connected to a reservoir tank with full recirculation containing the synthetic wastewater, and oxygen permeates through the wall membrane to the biofilm attached to it. For the two experiments reported in this work air is also sparged into the residual water in the tank providing an extra source of oxygen that diffuses simultaneously from the membrane and from the liquid into the biofilm. A pseudo-heterogeneous model using Monod kinetics with dual substrate limitation was employed to predict the observed evolution of substrate and dissolved oxygen concentrations in the MABR. The model accounts for the counter-diffusion of substrate and oxygen as well as for the reaction within the biofilm. It also predicts biomass growth and the production of extra cellular polymers, which in turn causes the biofilm to grow. Transport and kinetic parameters previously estimated, are used in the model to predict the growth rates in the biofilm and allow the analysis of the relative contribution of the rates of mass transport by diffusion, convection and growth reaction.									0	0	0		0	0	0			1542-6580			INSPEC:10214113

An experimental methodology has been developed to this purpose which is based on the generation of tailor-made ionic adducts in gaseous inert media and the investigation of their evolution to products. A survey of the most recent applications of this approach to the gas-phase study of the mechanism and the stereochemistry of ionic substitution and addition reactions is reported.

Herein, alpha-Fe2O3 pseudo-nanocubes have been synthesized with a facile solvothermal method, and then alpha-Fe2O3@N-C composite catalysts were prepared through chemical polymerization of pyrrole on alpha-Fe2O3, following with pyrolyzed in nitrogen atmosphere. The synthesized composite catalysts display enhanced ORR catalytic performances, including the positive shifting of the onset potential, improving of the limited current density with long-term stability compared to those of the pristine alpha-Fe2O3. The enhanced electrocatalytic performances could be ascribed to the low intrinsic and charge transfer resistances, the high content of pyridinic-N and/or Fe-N, the emergence of graphitic-N and abundant oxygen vacancy on the composite surface. This study here implies that the catalytic activity and stability of metal oxides with poor conductivity could be controlled and improved by simply coating with a nanoscale conductive layer, which shows promising potential applications as precious-metal free catalysts for various metal-air batteries and fuel cells.

Here, in combination of experiments and calculations, we demonstrated that the electronic structures and the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity of the confined Ni SAC in a nitrogen-doped carbon nanotube are modulated by the encapsulated Ni nanoparticle (Ni@NiNCNT). The synergistic interaction between Ni SAC and Ni nanoparticle endows the Ni@ NiNCNT with a satisfactory OER performance of 358 mV to achieve 10 mA cm-2 current density and a Tafel slope of 89 mV dec-1, superior to the control samples and commercial RuO2. In addition, when employed as an air-cathode catalyst for rechargeable zinc-air batteries (ZABs), a Ni@NiNCNT modified battery outperformed a Pt/C+RuO2 modified battery, with a higher power density and superior constant current charge-discharge cycle stability for 40 h. Theoretical simulations further revealed that the Ni nanoparticle can remarkably optimize the adsorption strength of oxygen atom on Ni SAC, leading to a small overpotential of 0.22 V for the rate-limiting step of *O formation. Furthermore, the charge transfer from Ni nanoparticle to Ni SAC, which handles Ni-d orbital characters of Ni SAC and accordingly the adsorption strength toward oxygenates, is responsible for the origin of the OER activity. Our results provide a new way to tune electronic structures of the SAC and thus to tune its catalytic activity and should be insightful for designing new type electrocatalysts based on SAC.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0887-0624	1520-5029		WOS:000875690900001

The results indicated that under air atmosphere the two types of sludge are different in their thermal behavior. In BF sludge, the exothermic carbon gasification (CO/CO2) reaction dominated the process, while in BOF sludge, the significant reaction occurred at 755 degrees C and was associated with a slight mass gain owing to the partial oxidation of Fe3O4 to Fe2O3. Under inert atmosphere, the thermal behavior of both BF and BOF sludges were dominated by a reduction reaction. In BF sludge, the endothermic reactions ranged from 785 to 1115 degrees C due to the reduction of iron oxides as follows: Fe2O3 -> Fe3O4 -> FeO -> Fe. A total mass loss of about 27.78% was observed in the TG curve. While in BOF sludge, the endothermic peaks corresponded to magnetite reduction to iron (Fe). The overall mass loss of the BOF was approximately 16.92%. The mass spectrum of gases evolution for both BF and BOF sludges revealed that CO/CO2 gases were released from the sludges.									2	0	0	0	1	0	2				2075-4701		WOS:000530137000101

Enhancing the OER rate and efficiency relies on understanding the water oxidation mechanism, which entails the characterization of the reaction intermediates. Very active Ru-bda type (bda is 2,2'-bipyridine-6,6'-dicarboxylate) molecular OER catalysts are proposed to operate via a transient 7-coordinate Ru-v=O intermediate, which so far has never been detected due to its high reactivity. Here we prepare and characterize a well-defined supported Ru(bda) catalyst on porous indium tin oxide (ITO) electrode. Site isolation of the catalyst molecules on the electrode surface allows trapping of the key 7-coordinate Ru-v=O intermediate at potentials above 1.34 V vs NHE at pH 1, which is characterized by electron paramagnetic resonance and in situ X-ray absorption spectroscopies. The in situ extended X-ray absorption fine structure analysis shows a Ru=O bond distance of 1.75 +/- 0.02 angstrom, consistent with computational results. Electrochemical studies and density functional theory calculations suggest that the water nucleophilic attack on the surface-bound Ru-v=O intermediate (O-O bond formation) is the rate limiting step for OER catalysis at low pH.									63	0	0	0	9	0	63			0002-7863			WOS:000422813300077	29219306

To clarify protection mechanisms, oxidation behaviors and mechanisms of CVD Si-B-C ceramic in wet oxygen from 700 degC to 1400 degC were investigated in this work. Microstructure, bonds transformation and phase evolution of Si-B-C ceramic after oxidation were analyzed. The weight loss of Si-B-C ceramic increased linearly with time between 700 degC and 1000 degC, while it changed in a non-linear way above 1200 degC. The oxidation production of Si-B-C ceramic in wet oxygen is mainly composed of Si(OH)4, SiO2, H3BO3, B2O3 and B2O. The oxidation resistance of Si-B-C in wet oxygen is better than that of single-phase B4C ceramic because borosilicate glass is rapidly formed, which can effectively resist the wet oxygen. No fiber oxidation is found up to 1400 degC. [All rights reserved Elsevier].									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0955-2219			INSPEC:16608623		
J	Leite, RHD; Cognet, P; Wilhelm, AM; Delmas, H								Anodic oxidation of 2,4-dihydroxybenzoic acid for wastewater treatment								JOURNAL OF APPLIED ELECTROCHEMISTRY				33	8			693	701						AUG 2003	2003	Dihydroxybenzoic acid (2,4-DHBA) is used as an intermediate chemical reactant in industrial synthetic processes. Disinfection of water contaminated by 2,4-DHBA, using chlorinating techniques, generates trihalomethane compounds, so that alternative degradation techniques are of interest. The electrochemical oxidation of 2,4-dihydroxybenzoic acid (2,4-DHBA) at a platinized titanium electrode was investigated. An electroanalytical study by linear and cyclic voltammetry showed adsorption of the reagent at the electrode surface. Mathematical treatment of cyclic voltammetry curves indicates Langmuir type adsorption. For electrolysis, working in the oxygen evolution region causes an increase in electroactive electrode surface area and better mass transfer at the electrode. For example, for an initial 2,4-DHBA concentration of 0.3 kg m(-3) and a current density of 300 A m(-2), almost complete conversion of the pollutant is obtained after passing 4 A h, together with a TOC decrease of 30%. Byproducts of electrodegradation include 2,3,4- and 2,4,5-trihydroxybenzoic acids (THBA), maleic acid, glyoxalic acid and oxalic acid. The faradaic yield is less than 18%, due to oxygen evolution during electrolysis.									19	1	0	0	9	0	19			0021-891X			WOS:000184577500005		
J	Luo, Xiaohu; Zhang, Lei; Guo, Meng; Liu, Zhen; Wu, Dawang; Zhen, Deshuai; Liu, Yali								Engineering the Structural Defects of Spinel Oxide Nanoneedles by Doping of V for a Highly Efficient Oxygen Evolution Reaction.								ACS applied materials & interfaces											10.1021/acsami.2c15524				2022-Oct-25	2022	Rational design of multi-structural defects in the transition-metal oxides is a very alluring and challenging strategy to significantly improve its oxygen evolution reaction (OER) performance. Herein, a simple and promising element doping approach is demonstrated to fabricate a poor-crystalline V-doping CuCo2O4 (V-CuCo2O4) nanoneedle with rich oxygen vacancies (Vo), partially amorphous phase, and Co2+ defects on the carbon fiber (CF) (V-CuCo2O4/CF). The results indicate that the V doping could further weaken the crystallinity of V-CuCo2O4, providing the thoroughfares for the convenience of electrolyte penetration and the exposure of active sites. Meanwhile, [CoO6] octahedron in the V-CuCo2O4 lattice is gravely distorted due to a strong electronic interaction between the doped V and Co atoms, creating more Co2+ active species. With the merits of these multiple structural defects, V-CuCo2O4/CF exhibits rich active sites, and its intrinsically electrocatalytic activity is significantly enhanced. The optimized V-CuCo2O4/CF electrocatalyst has a significantly enhanced OER activity with a required low overpotential of 204 and 246 mV at a current density of 100 and 300 mA cm-2, respectively, a small Tafel slope of 40.7 mV dec-1, and excellent stability in an alkaline medium. Furthermore, the results from the projected partial density of states calculation not only demonstrate that the 3-fol-coordinated Co near Vo bonded with Cu and V sites (Cu-Co(surf-Vo)-V) exhibits an enhanced electronic transfer activity but also reveal that the doped V could protect the Co sites from the deactivation by intermediates overbinding on the V sites. This work provides new insights into structure engineering of spinel phase copper cobaltite, resulting in significantly boosting electrocatalytic OER activity.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0				1944-8252		MEDLINE:36283003	36283003

However, their further development and application is hampered due to the lack of high-efficiency bifunctional air electrocatalysts. Herein, porous Co-doped NiO nanoflowers (Co-NiO NFs) with outstanding electrocatalytic activity and stability toward oxygen evolution reaction (ORR) and oxygen reduction reaction (OER) is reported for the first time, including a positive half-wave potential (0.79 V) for ORR and a small overpotential (1.53V at 10 mA cm(-2)) for OER. Firstly, the synergistic effect between the sound two-dimensional (2D) hexagonal framework and numerous nanopores inside the nanosheets offers an available surface for O-2 adsorption/diffusion, and a large effective electrochemical active surface area for exploring and utilizing more active sites. Secondly, Co dopants can effectively increase the conductivity of pristine NiO nanoflowers (NFs) and simultaneously enhances the intrinsic ORR and OER activity. Notably, the liquid ZnABs with engineered Co-NiO NFs electrode exhibits a high discharge peak power density of 93 mW cm(-2), a satisfactory specific capacity of 830 mA h g(-1) at the current density of 5 mA cm(-2), together with excellent cycling stability of 110 h at 2 mA cm(-2). Additionally, the corresponding all-solid-state ZnABs assembled with Co-NiO NFs shows a long durability with the stable charge-discharge cycles of 6h and good flexible nature.									69	2	0	0	4	0	69			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000465051700008

Initially, B,N,S tri-doped carbon quantum dots were prepared by a hydrothermal method using boric acid and L-cysteine as precursors, and were further immobilized on graphite oxide in the presence of a cobalt precursor to synthesise a nanocomposite of cobalt oxide and B,N,S tri-doped graphite oxide. The crystal structure and morphology of the BNS/rGO-Co nanocomposite were studied by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) imaging, respectively. Electrochemical studies indicated a substantially higher electrocatalytic activity of the catalyst with an onset potential (E-onse(t)) of 0.87 V vs. RHE and a current density (J(L)) of 4.4 mA cm(-2) at 1600 rpm in alkaline conditions. Additionally, rotating ring disc electrode (RRDE) measurements confirmed a single step similar to 4 electron transfer pathway, similar to that of Pt/C catalyst. Interestingly, the BNS/rGO-Co nanocomposite shows enhanced stability (up to 5000 cycles under similar conditions) and a high tolerance to methanol crossover effects, when compared to the state-of-the-art Pt/C catalyst. Concomitantly, the catalyst also exhibits remarkable oxygen evolution reaction activity. Such a remarkable electrocatalytic activity of the BNS/rGO-Co nanocomposite over its N,S-bi-doped counterpart is due to the importance of boron synergy with the N and S sites in the rGO, and also to the presence of the cobalt oxide interface for better conversion.									17	1	0	0	0	0	17			1144-0546	1369-9261		WOS:000445825800072

However, pristine MXenes usually show unsatisfactory catalytic activity compared with traditional platinum group metal electrocatalysts. We introduce both phosphorus and oxygen into Mo2CTx MXenes through a simple phosphorization course. The phosphorized Mo2CTx MXenes exhibit significantly improved electrocatalytic performance toward hydrogen evolution reaction compared with pristine Mo2CTx MXenes, with a dramatic decrease in overpotential (more than 100 mV at 10 mA cm(-2)). Theoretical computation suggests that P and O doped Mo2CTx MXenes possess a metallic band structure and an optimal hydrogen adsorption, which lead to improved conductivity and electrocatalytic kinetics, respectively. This work not only advances the understanding of property-tuning of the latest two-dimensional MXene materials but also paves the way for the development of MXene-based materials that can be applied in the field of energy conversion and storage.									55	4	0	0	2	0	56			2574-0962			WOS:000458706800065

Low overvoltages for hydrogen evolution were found and, at technical current densities, an effect of catalyst coating thickness. Commercial DSA(R) electrodes with RuO2 as the active compound were tested as cathodes and were less active but more stable than the coatings produced by us. Hypochlorite and chlorate were reduced in the absence of chromate, chlorate reduction being fast on ruthenium dioxide compared to the other electrode materials and by far the dominating cathodic reaction in chlorate electrolyte without chromate and hypochlorite at 70-degrees-C, 3 kA/m2.									68	1	0	0	1	0	70			0013-4651			WOS:A1993MG87300017

Notably, the focus is not on the detailed yield of all reaction intermediates and products but on the propensity to form soot. Based on the assumption that that primary tar from pyrolysis of plastic wastes is mostly formed by aliphatics which can undergo progressive aromatization to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and soot, a reaction network with 198 species and 6307 reactions proposed by Ranzi and coworkers was lumped into a very simple five reaction mechanism. The lumped kinetic model has been used to predict PAHs and soot formation in different conditions and proved to be a good alternative to comprehensive kinetic models up for relatively low temperature and short residence times (of up to 1 min at 1200 K, up to 1 s at 1400 K). At higher temperature/longer residence times, the simplified model still provides reasonable qualitative trends but the amount of PAHs and soot is underestimated. The timescale of aromatization under inert conditions appears similar for all the alkanes and alkenes examined and also the yields in main reaction products seem to scale well with the number of carbon and hydrogen atoms of the parent alkane/alkene. Evolution of the young aliphatic tar into large aromatics is prevented as long as gaseous oxygen being available for oxidation. The lumped kinetic model has been used to highlight the effect of different modes of oxygen feeding and of incomplete mixing of fuel and oxygen on the formation of PAH and soot.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1				1996-1073		WOS:000586211700001

However, it remains a great challenge to effectively manipulate the interface chemistry of heterostructures at the atomic level. Herein, functionalized carbon-supported Ru heterostructured electrocatalysts are designed that contain abundant Ru-N(O)-C moieties with a view towards fast hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). The coordination chemistry of the Ru-N(O)-C moieties, and hence, the geometric and electronic structures of the Ru species can be precisely modulated via an appropriate annealing treatment. Specifically, the optimal heterostructured electrocatalyst delivers the highest specific activity by far among reported Ru-based electrocatalysts, and the turnover frequency value reaches 32 s(-1) at the overpotential (eta) of 100 mV, which also surpasses the state-of-the-art Pt/C catalyst in alkaline media. The interface engineering of the heterostructured electrocatalyst not only facilitates H2O adsorption and dissociation with help from the Ru-N(O)-C moieties, but also further optimizes the adsorption behavior of H on the metallic Ru species, thereby inducing accelerated hydrogen evolution kinetics in both alkaline and acidic media. The present results demonstrate the successful atomic-level interface engineering of carbon-supported Ru-based heterostructures and shed new light on the development of advanced electrocatalysts for fast hydrogen evolution, and beyond.									31	2	0	0	1	0	30			1616-301X	1616-3028		WOS:000660422800001

Multimetallic nanomaterials serve as state-of-the-art electrocatalysts as a consequence of their unique physico-chemical properties. One method of enhancing the electrocatalytic performance of multimetallic nanomaterials is to tune or control the surface strain of the nanomaterials, and tremendous progress has been made in this area in the past decade. In this Review, we summarize advances in the introduction, tuning and quantification of strain in multimetallic nanocrystals to achieve more efficient energy conversion by electrocatalysis. First, we introduce the concept of strain and its correlation with other key physico-chemical properties. Then, using the electrocatalytic reduction of oxygen as a model reaction, we discuss the underlying mechanisms behind the strain-adsorption-reactivity relationship based on combined classical theories and models. We describe how this knowledge can be harnessed to design multimetallic nanocrystals with optimized strain to increase the efficiency of oxygen reduction. In particular, we highlight the unexpectedly beneficial (and previously overlooked) role of tensile strain from multimetallic nanocrystals in improving electrocatalysis. We conclude by outlining the challenges and offering our perspectives on the research directions in this burgeoning field.									488	37	0	0	20	0	494			2058-8437			WOS:000415189300001

To lower operating temperatures, the state-of-the-art SOCs with highly active cobaltite-based oxygen electrodes essentially require doped-ceria interlayers to avoid undesirable reactions with commercially available zirconia electrolytes. However, the inherent cation interdiffusion between ceria and zirconia materials at high temperatures (>1300 degrees C) has retarded the construction of highly dense and stoichiometric ceria/zirconia bilayers. This study reports the fabrication of a highly conductive, ultra-thin (250 nm), and defect-free Sm0.075Nd0.075Ce0.85O2-delta (SNDC) interlayer via readily processable gelatin-assisted deposition. The SOC with the gelatin-derived SNDC interlayer achieved exceptionally high electrochemical performances both in the fuel cell (approximate to 3.34 W cm(-2)) and electrolysis mode (approximate to 2.1 A cm(-2) at 1.3 V) at 750 degrees C-one of the best records for SOCs with similar configuration to date-along with excellent long-term durability (1500 h). Mechanistic analysis reveals that the ultra-thin and dense structure of the SNDC interlayer provides a faster route for oxygen-ion conduction and more active sites for both oxygen reduction and oxygen evolution reactions at the oxygen electrode/electrolyte interface. The findings suggest that the thin and dense gelatin-derived SNDC interlayer has great potential for use in high-performance reversible SOCs.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1616-301X	1616-3028		WOS:000851236000001

However, the detailed atomic structure of this hybrid material is not well understood. To elucidate the Co/ graphene electronic structure, we have developed a flow cell closed by a graphene membrane that provides electronic and chemical information on the active surfaces under atmospheric pressure and in the presence of liquids by means of X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS).

However, the performance is typically rather limited due to the sluggish electron-transfer kinetics of oxygen reduction reaction at the cathode. Thus, development of high-performance cathode catalysts is of fundamental significance for the wide-spread application of microbial fuel cell. In this study, nanocomposites based on cobalt oxide nanoparticles supported on nitrogen-doped carbon nanotubes (Co/N-CNT) were synthesized by controlled pyrolysis of graphitic carbon nitride and cobalt acetate. Electrochemical tests indicated that the Co/N-CNT nanocomposites exhibited a high ORR electrocatalytic activity with a half-wave potential of +0.82 V and onset potential of +0.91 V vs. RHE, mostly via a four-electron reduction pathway. This was ascribed to the formation of high-efficiency Co-N active sites that facilitated the OIRR kinetics. A microbial fuel cell using the as-prepared Co/N-CNT as the cathode catalyst achieved a maximum power density of 1260 mW m(-2), which was 16.6% higher than that based on state-of-art Pt/C catalyst (1080 mW m(-2)). The results suggest that Co/N-CNT nanocomposites may serve as viable cathode catalysts in microbial fuel cell application.									15	0	0	0	2	0	15			1387-7003	1879-0259		WOS:000479022200013

Spherical ZnS particles are synthesized with a facile hydrothermal method, and they are further used as core materials to introduce ZnO shell layer surrounding the core part by partial oxidation under controlled oxygen contents. The resulting ZnS core-ZnO shell photocatalysts represent the heterostructural type II band alignment. The existence of oxide layer also influences on proton adsorption power with an aid of strong base cites derived from highly electronegative oxygen atoms in ZnO shell layer. Photocatalytic water splitting reaction is performed to evaluate catalyst efficiency under standard one sun condition, and the highest hydrogen evolution rate (1665 mu molg(-1)h(-1)) is achieved from the sample oxidized at 16.2 kPa oxygen pressure. This highest hydrogen production rate is achieved in cooperation with increased light absorption and promoted charge separations. Photoluminescence analysis reveals that the improved visible light response is obtained after thermal oxidation process due to the oxygen vacancy states in the ZnO shell layer. Therefore, overall photocatalytic efficiency in solar hydrogen production is enhanced by improved charge separations, crystallinity, and visible light responses from the ZnS core-ZnO shell structures induced by thermal oxidation.									25	3	0	0	1	0	27			0378-7753	1873-2755		WOS:000433267100010

However, most of these compounds only undergo surface reconstruction under operating conditions, which contains a large percentage of inactive atoms in the core, thus limiting the exposure of the active sites. Here, we synthesize a Ni-Mo-Se precatalyst with three-dimensional hierarchical structure and develop a facile on-site electrochemical activation strategy for achieving deep reconstruction of the precatalyst. Using the combination of multiple spectroscopic characterizations and high resolution electron microscopy techniques, we unravel that the Ni-Mo-Se precatalyst is deeply reconstructed into gamma-NiOOH with co-leaching of Mo and Se after the anodic oxidation. Such flower-like gamma-NiOOH is constituted by distorted ultrathin nanosheets with a thickness of similar to 4.5 nm and contains abundant intercalated species such as water and OH-/CO32-, thus offering a large quantity of accessible active sites. To reach the current density of 10 mA cm(-2), the derived electrode requires an overpotential of only 244 mV, outperforming almost all the reported analogues. This work highlights the reconstruction chemistry and provides a simple method for the preparation of efficient OER electrocatalyst.

The main factor defining the catalytic activity of RuS2 for water oxidation, both in the dark and under illumination, is a low overpotential (eta approximate to 0.3 V), which is comparable to that of the RuO2 catalyst for oxygen evolution at darkness. Evidence has been given that eta is determined by the E-o(Ru-s-OHo/Ru-s-H2O) redox potential, which strongly depends on the bonding energy of Ru surface species with OHo radicals generated by direct oxidation of adsorbed water molecules (interfacial Ru-peroxo-type complex formation). This bonding energy increases as the RuS2 surface becomes oxidized under anodic polarization and reaches its maximum value at the potential of the S2RuO2/RuS2 transition (VIII Ru oxidation state), Further oxidation of the Ru-peroxo-type complexes leads to oxygen evolution at a rate which increases with the degree of oxidation of the Ru surface active centers. Although O-2 evolution probably already takes place on Ru(VI) surface sites, high evolution rates (current densities) are only reached under oxidation state VIII. However, in this state (idealized S2Ru(VIII)O-2) Ru-S surface bonds are weakened and occasionally broken, contributing to RuS2 dissolution with generation of volatile RuO4 and SO42--soluble ions as the main corrosion products. This phenomenon may be attributed. to the reaction in acidic medium of H2O molecules with Ru(VIII) surface species, giving rise to the formation of unstable intermediate complexes.									10	0	0	0	1	0	10			0013-4651	1945-7111		WOS:000071382900042

Using density functional theory we investigated the site dependent ORR activity of nitrogen doped and divacancy (DV_555-777) graphene structures considering free energy calculations and correlate with the occupancy of pz(pi) electrons. The dioxygen adsorption strength differs for each carbon site in case of N doped and DV_555-777 graphene system. Range of overpotential and on-set potential has been estimated for same system. Among the sites and systems considered, the C2' site of 2N doped graphene system is most active towards oxygen reduction with lowest overpotential. We have found that the DV_555-777 is more active than the pure system. In this case also we have observed a range of overpotential considering various C sites. We have been estimated the occupancy of pz(pi) electrons of each C site of different systems. The occupancy of pz(pi) electrons of C atoms increase near the dopant site due to back-donation mechanism in N doped graphene system. A strong correlation has been identified in-between activity of each C site with the occupancy of pz(pi) electrons of corresponding site. Overall we concluded that each C site of N doped and defective graphene has different on-set potential and pz(pi) electrons play a major role to define the activity. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

This provides ideal models for investigating and understanding the relationships between structures and catalytic activities at the molecular level. However, the active sites on the edges of two-dimensional (2D) MOFs have rarely been studied, as they are less exposed to the surfaces. Here, for the first time, we synthesized and observed that the 2D layers could align perpendicular to the surface of a 2D zeolitic imidazolate framework L (ZIF-L) with a leaf-like morphology. Owing to this unique orientation, the active sites on the edges of the 2D crystal structure could mostly be exposed to the surfaces. Interestingly, when another layer of ZIF-L-Co was grown heteroepitaxially onto ZIF-L-Zn (ZIF-L-Zn@ZIF-L-Co), the two layers shared a common b axis but rotated by 90 degrees in the ac plane. This demonstrated that we could control exposed facets of the 2D MOFs. The ZIF-L-Co with more exposed edge active sites exhibited high electrocatalytic activity for oxygen reduction reaction. This work provides a new concept of designing unique oriented layers in 2D MOFs to expose more edge-active sites for efficient electrocatalysis.[GRAPHICS].									2	0	0	0	0	0	2				2096-5745		WOS:000794318300018		
J	Zong, Meng; Ding, Zhaoqing; He, Wei; Luo, Jing; Tang, Zhenghua								Peptide Based Noble Metal Nanomaterials for Oxygen Reduction Reaction: A Review								INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ELECTROCHEMICAL SCIENCE				15	3			2634	2647		10.20964/2020.03.50				MAR 2020	2020	Green energy devices including proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs) and rechargeable metal air batteries (RMABs), play a significant role in ameliorating global energy scarcity and severe environment pollution issues. Unfortunately, the sluggish oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) occurring at the cathode restrains the deployment and advancement of PEMFCs and RMABs. Commercial Pt/C catalyst embraces excellent ORR performance but suffers from high cost, limited platinum reserve, as well as undesirable stability and durability. Recently, peptide-based noble metal nanomaterials with distinguished activity and robust durability have been emerging as a new type of ORR catalyst, as the preparation of such catalyst is environmentally friendly, and peptide can manipulate the physical, chemical and electronic properties of the catalyst with desirable functionalities. In this review, the basic principle and mechanism regarding ORR are firstly introduced and discussed, along with the recent progresses of peptide-based nanomaterials. Afterwards, we systematically summarize the achievements regarding employing peptide as template to prepare single noble metal, alloyed bimetallic, and core-shell bimetallic nanomaterials for achieving improved ORR activity and stability. In the end, the ascendancies, challenges and perspectives in this flourishing realm will be expounded, with an emphasis on the great potentials and opportunities to engineer peptide-based noble metal nanomaterials as highefficiency and durable catalysts for ORR and other electrochemical energy applications.									1	1	0	0	0	0	2			1452-3981			WOS:000519545900060

J	Ahmed, Zubair; Bagchi, Vivek								Current trends and perspectives on emerging Fe-derived noble-metal-free oxygen electrocatalysts								NEW JOURNAL OF CHEMISTRY				45	47			22012	22033		10.1039/d1nj05062a		NOV 2021		DEC 6 2021	2021	Oxygen electrochemistry that comprises oxygen evolution and reduction reactions (OER/ORR) is vital for sustainable, clean, and efficient energy generation. However, the high activation barrier due to the multi-electron transfer process makes them sluggish and requires noble metals (e.g. Ir, Ru, or Pt) to overcome the kinetic barrier. This increases the cost of sustainable devices such as metal-air batteries and fuel cells and, in turn, obstructs their wide-scale applications. In this context, it is necessary to explore noble-metal-free efficient oxygen electrocatalysts to produce a surge in the practical applicability of these technologies. Since Fe facilitates these reactions and is widely available, it has emerged as an element of interest in different forms, such as oxides, phosphides, chalcogenides, layered double hydroxides, Fe-N-C, single atoms, and some other hetero-structured composites with carbon-based (graphene, carbon nanotubes, etc.) materials. This review assesses the strategies utilized in the development of Fe-derived materials without involving noble metals in the catalysis under alkaline conditions. It also focuses on the approaches used to transform well-known Fe-derived ORR materials to OER and vice versa or into bifunctional catalysts. Furthermore, we highlight the significant role of modifying various fundamentally important parameters, such as the fabrication methods and their consequent morphological and electronic deviations in establishing promising new Fe-based catalytic materials. This assessment will bring valuable fit to the existing literature and assist in gaining important information to extract practical applications from Fe-derived noble-metal-free electrocatalysts.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			1144-0546	1369-9261		WOS:000722305200001

A cluster of manganese, calcium, and chloride ions, whose binding environment is optimized by PSII extrinsic proteins, catalyzes this water-splitting reaction. The accepted view is that in plants and green algae, the three extrinsic proteins are PsbO, PsbP, and PsbQ, whereas in cyanobacteria, they are PsbO, PsbV, and PsbU. Our previous proteomic analysis established the presence of a PsbQ homolog in the cyanobacterium Synechocystis 6803. The current study additionally demonstrates the presence of a PsbP homolog in cyanobacterial PSII. Both psbP and psbQ inactivation mutants exhibited reduced photoautotrophic growth as well as decreased water oxidation activity under CaCl2-depleted conditions. Moreover, purified PSII complexes from each mutant had significantly reduced activity. In cyanobacteria, one PsbQ is present per PSII complex, whereas PsbP is significantly substoichiometric. These findings indicate that both PsbP and PsbQ proteins are regulators that are necessary for the biogenesis of optimally active PSII in Synechocystis 6803. The new picture emerging from these data is that five extrinsic PSII proteins, PsbO, PsbP, PsbQ, PsbU, and PsbV, are present in cyanobacteria, two of which, PsbU and PsbV, have been lost during the evolution of green plants.									149	4	1	0	150	0	153			1040-4651	1532-298X		WOS:000223195000017	15258264

In this work, large-size-exfoliated MXene sheets render a flat and flexible platform for the decoration of Co(OH)F, CoP and Co7Se8, allowing them to exhibit high electrocatalytic performances; thanks to the maximized surface area and conductivity. CoP/MXene shows enhanced oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity, with substantially lower overpotential (eta = 230 mV) at 10 mA cm(-2) compared to those of IrO2 (300 mV). Furthermore, a hybrid bifunctional electrode (CoP/MXene//CoP/MXene) exhibits highly stable and efficient overall water splitting performance (1.56 V@10 mA cm(-2)) as compared to the benchmark electrode couple IrO2/C//Pt/C (1.62 V@10 mA cm(-2)) in alkaline solution. Furthermore, we elucidate the oxidation process of the anion components (P and Se) of the hybrid catalysts under OER conditions and verify their significant influence on the activity and stability. Notably, the surface oxidation of CoP/MXene results in a POx-enriched Co-OOH/CoP/MXene hybrid, which enables retention of consistent activity and stability. On the other hand, SeOx deposition on the Co-OOH/Co7Se8/MXene surface significantly deteriorates the activity and stability of the catalyst. These results not only highlight the insight on the correlation between oxidized anion species and the intrinsic activity of hybridized electrocatalysts but also impart the systematic synthetic design of MXene-supported catalysts with high water-splitting efficiency.									46	3	0	0	4	0	48			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000502302300017

The samples were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy dispersive spectrum analysis (EDS), charge-discharge cycle tests, charge-discharge cycle tests of limited capacity, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) tests. The result showed that Ce (x) Mn1-x O-2 can effectively reduce the charge overpotential of the cathode. The charge and discharge electrical potential difference of Ce0.1Mn0.9O2 was only 700 mV while MnO2's was 2100 mV. And Ce0.1Mn0.9O2 that exhibited high discharge capacity of 400 mAh g(-1) in air had a stable discharge platform of 2.5 V and then the more obvious charge phenomenon appeared after 3.5 V. The excellent catalysis, the effect of cathode catalytic materials named Ce (x) Mn1-x O-2, may attribute to the decrease of reaction potential energy of oxygen reduction reaction and oxygen evolution reaction.

The air cathode of is one of the most expensive cell components and a key factor in determining the performance of Zn-air batteries. As a fuel, O-2 availability to the air cathode is determined by the level of both its dissolution and diffusion in an electrolyte, whereby electrocatalysis happens in the three-phase interface where the catalyst, electrolyte, and O-2 meet. Maximizing the performance of air cathodes by rational design of the catalyst structure is of significant importance. To date, various electrocatalysts, including heteroatom-doped carbon, transition metal nitrides/oxides/sulfides, and perovskite oxides, have been developed with outstanding oxygen reduction reaction and oxygen evolution activity. More and more researchers are trying to apply electrocatalysts into Zn-air battery prototypes. The aim of this review is to afford a better understanding of air cathodes and provide guidelines to the researchers for the design and construction of high-performance, easyto-use cathodes for metal-air batteries.									180	13	0	0	4	0	183			2051-6347	2051-6355		WOS:000413945100001

The role of CoO(OH) active sites has not been given sufficient importance to compare the activity in these systems. In order to explain the OER activity in relation to metal ion sites, we have synthesized three different cobalt phosphorous oxyanion systems such as NaCoPO4 (CP-1), Co-11(HPO3)(8)(OH)(6) (CP-2), and Co-3(OH)(2)(HPO4)(2) (CP-3) and compared their OER activity with detailed analysis of cyclic voltammograms. Though CP-2 and CP-3 possess a higher number of proton abstracting ligands per metal site than CP-1, it is observed that CP-1 shows an OER activity similar to CP-3 in terms of onset potential and Tafel slope values. A careful estimation of the effective number of reduction sites in terms of Co4+/Co3+ and Co3+/Co2+ reduction reveals that CP-1 and CP-3 show higher values in accordance with the observed OER activity trend, CP-1 similar to CP-3 > CP-2. The average number of CoOx(OH)y reduction sites in the Co4+ <-> Co3+ <-> Co2+ sequence explains the OER performance better than the ratio of reduction current density or Co3+ reducibility. The changes in morphology and chemical composition of the abovementioned systems after OER cycles support the formation of active species, cobalt oxyhydroxide during OER. The CP-1, CP2, and CP-3 catalysts show stable current density at similar to 10 mA/cm(2) up to 10 h.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			1932-7447	1932-7455		WOS:000726699600002

To this extent, this research is focused on the synthesis of novel amine-functionalized single (Zr) and bimetallic (Zr, Ni) MOF viz. NH2-UiO-66(Zr) and NH2- UiO-66(Zr/Ni), followed by their testing as cathode catalysts to improve oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in a microbial fuel cell (MFC) for bioenergy recovery from organic wastes. The physical and chemical character-ization techniques depicted the successful synthesis of octahedral-shaped MOF nanoparticles with similar structural integrity despite the incorporation of the secondary metal ion. However, electrochemical analyses demonstrated NH2-UiO-66(Zr/Ni) as a better catalyst, achieving a high ORR peak current, low charge transfer resistance, and high diffusion coefficient as compared to both NH2-UiO-66(Zr) and 10% Pt-C catalyzed cathodes. MFC performance evaluation further confirmed the high catalytic activity of NH2-UiO-66(Zr/Ni), allowing to recover a power density (PD) of 0.8 W/m(2) at a coulombic efficiency (CE) of 75.4%, outperforming the MFC using 10 % Pt-C catalysed cathode. This study suggests that the NH2-UiO-66(Zr/Ni) can be used as an efficient ORR catalyst for application in large-scale MFCs.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0378-7753	1873-2755		WOS:000859394100004

The sizes of the Cu clusters were characterized by scanning tunneling microscopy (STM). Methanol chemistry on the vacuum-annealed, reduced TiO2 surface itself produces ethylene as the main desorption product. Reoxidation of the TiO2 surface quenches the production of ethylene but also results in a new formaldehyde desorption peak at 870 K. The reactivity of methanol on small Cu nanoclusters (40.2 +/- 7.0 Angstrom diameter, 12.7 +/- 2.4 Angstrom height) is minimal, but trace amounts of formaldehyde, CO2, methane and H-2 are detected in TPD experiments, demonstrating that the Cu nanoclusters are more active than bulk single-crystal Cu surfaces. On oxygen-covered Cu nanoclusters, methanol reaction produces formaldehyde and CO2 as the major gaseous products as well as H-2, water, and methane. The yields of formaldehyde and CO2 increase as the Cu coverage is increased from 2 to 12 ML, indicating that these products are formed from reaction associated with the Cu surface. Lattice oxygen from the titania surface participates in methanol reaction because reoxidation of the titania surface with O-18(2) prior Cu deposition results in the evolution of (H2O)-O-18, (COO)-O-16-O-18, and (CO2)-O-18 in TPD experiments. No cluster size effects were observed for methanol chemistry on the pure Cu and oxygencovered Cu clusters.									33	0	0	0	0	0	33			1520-6106	1520-5207		WOS:000225227700025

Metal organic frameworks (MOFs) and covalent organic frameworks (COFs) have gained great attention for various applications due to their attractive features of structural tunability, high surface area and high porosity. Herein, a core-shell structured carbon-based hybrid electrocatalyst (H-NSC@Co/NSC), which contains high density active sites of MOF-derived shell (Co/NSC) and COF-derived hollow core (H-NSC), is successfully fabricated by direct pyrolysis of covalently-connected COF@ZIF-67 hybrid. The core-shell H-NSC@Co/NSC hybrid manifests excellent catalytic properties toward both OER and ORR with a small potential gap ( increment E = 0.75 V). The H-NSC@Co/NSC assembled Zn-air battery exhibits a high power-density of 204.3 mW cm(-2) and stable rechargeability, outperforming that of Pt/C+RuO2 assembled Zn-air battery. Density functional theory calculations reveal that the electronic structure of the carbon frameworks on the Co/NSC shell can be effectively modulated by the embedded Co nanoparticles (NPs), facilitating the adsorption of oxygen intermediates and leading to enhanced catalytic activity. This work will provide a strategy to design highly-efficient electrocatalysts for application in energy conversion and storage.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1613-6810	1613-6829		WOS:000822342600001	35808960	
J	Villalobos, Javier; Golnak, Ronny; Xi, Lifei; Schuck, Goetz; Risch, Marcel					Villalobos, Javier/0000-0002-8032-6574			Reversible and irreversible processes during cyclic voltammetry of an electrodeposited manganese oxide as catalyst for the oxygen evolution reaction								JOURNAL OF PHYSICS-ENERGY				2	3					034009	10.1088/2515-7655/ab9fe2				JUL 2020	2020	Manganese oxides have received much attention over the years among the wide range of electrocatalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) due to their low toxicity, high abundance and rich redox chemistry. While many previous studies focused on the activity of these materials, a better understanding of the material transformations relating to activation or degradation is highly desirable, both from a scientific perspective and for applications. We electrodeposited Na-containing MnO(x)without long-range order from an alkaline solution to investigate these aspects by cyclic voltammetry, scanning electron microscopy and x-ray absorption spectroscopy at the Mn-K and Mn-L edges. The pristine film was assigned to a layered edge-sharing Mn(3+/4+)oxide with Mn-O bond lengths of mainly 1.87 angstrom and some at 2.30 angstrom as well as Mn-Mn bond lengths of 2.87 angstrom based on fits to the extended x-ray fine structure. The decrease of the currents at voltages before the onset of the OER followed power laws with three different exponents depending on the number of cycles and the Tafel slope decreases from 186 +/- 48 to 114 +/- 18 mV dec(-1)after 100 cycles, which we interpret in the context of surface coverage with unreacted intermediates. Post-mortem microscopy and bulk spectroscopy at the Mn-K edge showed no change of the microstructure, bulk local structure or bulk Mn valence. Yet, the surface region of MnO(x)oxidized toward Mn4+, which explains the reduction of the currents in agreement with literature. Surprisingly, we find that MnO(x)reactivates after 30 min at open-circuit (OC), where the currents and also the Tafel slope increase. Reactivation processes during OC are crucial because OC is unavoidable when coupling the electrocatalysts to intermittent power sources such as solar energy for sustainable energy production.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			2515-7655			WOS:000569870400001		
J	Zhao, Songlin; Ran, Siyi; Shi, Ning; Liu, Maolin; Zeng, Yan; Sun, Wei; Zhu, Zhihong					Sun, Wei/0000-0002-9923-7328			Facile synthesis of carbon nanosheet arrays decorated with chromium-doped Co nanoparticles as advanced bifunctional catalysts for Zn-air batteries								INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY				47	71			30449	30459		10.1016/j.ijhydene.2022.07.016				AUG 19 2022	2022	The development of low-cost electrochemical catalytic nanomaterials for efficient oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) through structural and composition control is a great challenge. Herein, a 3D hybrid structure is designed by an in -situ approach for growing 2D leaf-like nanosheet arrays on 1D electrospun nanofibers. The resultant catalysts composed of Cr-doped Co nanoparticle decorated N-doped carbon nanosheet and carbon nanofiber are synthesized by subsequent Cr(3+ )impregnation and heat treatment. The excellent properties of the as-prepared cathode benefit from the novel establishment of the 3D structure and the regulating mechanism of the electron density of Co after Cr doping, which simultaneously increases the mass and charge transfer process during the catalytic reaction. Consequently, Cr-0.10-Co@NC exhibits excellent catalytic performance for the ORR (with a half-wave potential of 0.84 V) and OER (with an over -potential of 370 mV). When used in a homemade ZAB for evaluating their practical reversible performance, the device exhibits a higher open-circuit voltage (1.45 V) and a smaller potential gap (0.73 V) with excellent cycle durability of 110 h. This work offers a well-designed structure and development for synthesizing efficient and durable electro-catalysts in electrochemical energy conversion technologies.

Herein, we fabricated the hollow composite that CoFe alloy nanoparticles decorated on the tubular N-doped carbon (denoted as T-CoFe/NC) by soft-templating strategy. In order to effectively incorporate the CoFe alloy into nitrogen doped hollow carbon matrix, g-C3N4 nanotubes were selected as the template to attain high contents of nitrogen doping for tubular carbon matrix. Meanwhile, the coordination effect between tannic acid and metal ions is utilized to limit the metal agglomeration in the process of pyrolysis. Consequently, the resultant catalyst shows an outstanding ORR activity with the half-wave potential of 0.86 V and outstanding stability with only a 2 mV decay after 10,000 cycles. T-CoFe/NC also displays comparable overpotential to the RuO2 at 10 mA cm(-2). The high bifunctional electrocatalytic activity is attributed to the unique tubular structure and the combination of Co with Fe can optimize the interaction between the oxygenic species and metal surfaces, enhancing the catalytic activity. And T-CoFe/NC based zinc-air battery exhibits excellent power density, large capacity and good cycling stability. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V.

Herein, a Co@WC1-x/NCNTs composite that contains a heterostructure consisting of cobalt and tungsten carbide (WC1-x) and loaded on self-assembled N-doped carbon nanotubes (NCNTs), is synthesized from simple compounds using facile hydrothermal and calcination. Co@WC1-x/NCNTs composite demonstrates outstanding electrocatalytic performance for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) with higher halfwave potential (0.81 V) and the current density of 5.75 mA cm(-2), as well as for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) having a lower overpotential (330 mV). Furthermore, it possess an ultra-high power density of 290 mW cm(-2), a specific capacity of 754.9 mAh g(-1) and charge-discharge stability in zinc-air batteries. The superior electrocatalytic performance of the composite may be ascribed to the synergistic effect between Co@WC1-x hetemstmcture, and N-doped carbon nanotubes. The formation of a heterojunction interface between Co and WCi_x may make possible the enrichment of electrons from carbon to Co (NCNTs -> WC1-x -> Highly active sites Co) during the catalytic process. This in turn facilitates the electrocatalytic process. This research offers a meaningful strategy for exploring efficient bifunctional catalyst used in zinc-air batteries.									8	0	0	0	0	0	8			0378-7753	1873-2755		WOS:000607096900004		
J	Liu, Yang; Gao, Wei; Zhou, Hao; Yi, Xianliang; Bao, Yongming								Highly reactive bulk lattice oxygen exposed by simple water treatment of LiCoO2 for catalytic oxidation of airborne benzene								MOLECULAR CATALYSIS				492						111003	10.1016/j.mcat.2020.111003				AUG 2020	2020	Aiming at a simple and effective way to activate the recycled cathode materials from spent Li-ion batteries for air cleaning, LiCoO2 was synthesized and treated by water for airborne benzene removal. Compared with the pristine sample, whose benzene conversion was similar to 20 % at 400 degrees C, the water-treated one could fulfill 100 % of conversion for 431 ppm of benzene at 300 degrees C under 120 L g(-1) h(-1) of space velocity. Furthermore, the water treatment process also worked effectively with the commercialized LiCoO2. Characterization results showed that surface oxygen, i.e., chemically adsorbed oxygen and surficial lattice oxygen, only acted as benzene adsorption sites inert towards benzene oxidation whereas bulk lattice oxygen was reactive for oxidation reaction. Water treatment played two roles in updating the LiCoO2 surface properties. One was to remove the excessive Li2CO3 and the thus-generated sites could adsorb gaseous oxygen, which was catalyzed to directly oxidize the gas-phase benzene into surface by-products at low temperatures (150-200 degrees C) following the Elay-Rideal pathway. Another more important role was to expose the bulk lattice oxygen by eliminating the surface oxygen species. The thus-exposed bulk lattice oxygen worked at high temperatures (250-400 degrees C) and could effectively oxidize the adsorbed benzene following the Mars-van Krevelen mechanism.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			2468-8231			WOS:000549100200020

The abundant-reserving transition metals and their phosphides are becoming attractive Pt alternatives for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Herein, a. crystalline/amorphous Co/CoP film was facilely prepared on nickel foam (NF) by a one-step electrodeposition technique at room temperature, named Co/CoP-NF. The as-prepared Co/CoP-NF electrocatalyst exhibits excellent electrocatalytic activity for HER, on par with Pt/C, showing a low overpotential of 35 mV at a current density of 10 mA.cm(-2) and small Tafel slope of 71 mV.dec(-1) in 1.0 M NaOH solution. More importantly, the Co/CoP-NF catalyst presents good long-term durability at an overpotential of 60 mV. Moreover, the influence of the electrodeposition parameters on the catalytic performance of the catalyst was discussed. This study offers an effective strategy to develop a non-noble-metal HER catalyst for industrial production of hydrogen.									108	7	0	0	6	0	110			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000387095300024	27731623

However, the rational design of atomically dispersed iron over nitrogen-doped carbons with activity comparable to that of Pt-C is still challenging. Herein, we develop a new approach that enables the direct formation of intrinsically nitrogen-functionalized two-dimensional sheet-like carbons containing a high concentration of single Fe atoms. This strategy only involves one-step pyrolysis of both, guanine and iron nitrate, without using any guiding agent and sacrificial template. The electrochemistry tests demonstrate an excellent ORR performance of the prepared Fe-N-x-C catalyst with a half-wave potential of 0.85 V and a limited current density of 6.5 mA/cm(2) in alkaline medium, outperforming the commercial Pt-C and most of previously reported Fe-N-x-C catalysts. We believe that the emergence of superior ORR performance is mostly attributed to the uniform dispersion of single Fe atoms at the molecular level and the formation of abundant coordinated Fe-N-x sites. In addition, the high surface area, optimal porosity and defective structure (particularly the defects at the edge) of the two-dimensional carbons are also beneficial for the improved ORR activity.									75	4	0	0	0	0	76			0378-7753	1873-2755		WOS:000456762100015

The thylakoids and Triton-treated membranes isolated from stressed seedlings showed declines in O-2-evolving capacity (H2O --> 2,6-dichloro-p-benzoquinone, DCBQ) and electron transport activity (H2O --> 2,6-dichlorophenol indophenol, DCIP). A partial restoration of O-2-evolution by adding CaCl2 suggested an effect of water stress on the oxygen-enhancing extrinsic (OEE) polypeptides. Water stress had an additional impact on the reaction centre, shown by the inability of 1,5-diphenylcarbazide (DPC) to restore the electron transport (DPC --> DCIP) to the levels seen in control membranes. Quantification of specific photosynthetic membrane proteins by immunoblots strengthened the above suggestions: after drought stress, concentrations of OEE1 and OEE2 declined by 40 %, and amount of the reaction centre protein D1, ATP synthetase, and cytochrome f also declined. The specific effect of stress on these proteins was confirmed by the fact that the amount of chlorophyll-protein complex CP2 was unchanged in membranes isolated from drought-stressed seedlings.									14	0	0	0	12	0	16			0300-3604	1573-9058		WOS:000071319600005

Electrolysis of water is a promising hydrogen production technique with zero emissions, but suffer from relatively high production costs. In order to make electrolysis of water sustainable, abundant, and efficient materials has to replace expensive and scarce noble metals as electrocatalysts in the reaction cells. Herein, we study activated stainless steel as a bi-functional electrocatalyst for the full water splitting reaction by taking advantage of nickel and iron suppressed within the bulk. The final electrocatalyst consists of a stainless steel mesh with a modified surface of layered NiFe nanosheets. By using a top down approach, the nanosheets stay well anchored to the surface and maintain an excellent electrical connection to the bulk structure. At ambient temperature, the activated stainless steel electrodes produce 10 mA/cm(2) at a cell voltage of 1.78 V and display an onset for water splitting at 1.68 V in 1M KOH, which is close to benchmarking nanosized catalysts. Furthermore, we use a scalable activation method using no externally added electrocatalyst, which could be a practical and cheap alternative to traditionally catalyst-coated electrodes.									10	0	0	0	0	0	10				1996-1944		WOS:000477043900092	31269744

The photosynthetic response of bark chloroplasts to interior stem environments has been studied recently in woody plants. However, the molecular regulatory mechanisms underlying specific characteristics of bark photosynthesis remain unclear. To address this knowledge gap, differences in the structure, photosynthetic activity and protein expression profiles between bark and leaf chloroplasts were investigated in Salix matsudana in this study. Bark chloroplasts exhibited broader and lower grana stacks and higher levels of starch relative to leaf chloroplasts. Concomitantly, decreased oxygen evolution rates and decreased saturated radiation point were observed in bark chloroplasts. Furthermore, a total of 293 differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) were identified in bark and leaf chloroplast profile comparisons. These DEPs were significantly enriched in photosynthesis-related biological processes or Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathways associated with photosynthesis. All 116 DEPs within the KEGG pathways associated with photosynthesis light reactions were downregulated in bark chloroplasts, including key proteins responsible for chlorophyll synthesis, light energy harvesting, nonphotochemical quenching, linear electron transport and photophosphorylation. Interestingly, seven upregulated proteins involved in dark reactions were identified in bark chloroplasts that comprised two kinds of malic enzymes typical of C-4-type photosynthesis. These results provide comprehensive proteomic evidence to understand the low photochemical capability of bark chloroplasts and suggest that bark chloroplasts might fix CO2 derived from malate decarboxylation.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0829-318X	1758-4469		WOS:000742398600013	33987679

Such knowledge is vital for understanding dynamic changes in catalyst reactivity and mechanisms behind catalyst stability or degradation. Due to significant technological developments in recent years, investigations of working electrolyte/electrode interfaces have become increasingly feasible.

The catalysts were chosen due to their de-N2O operation in significantly different temperature regimes. Several micro-kinetic models were evaluated for describing the transient responses of N2O, N-2, and O-2 obtained in N2O pulse experiments at 823-973 K. Thorough discrimination between these models enabled us to conclude that the preferred models of N2O decomposition over BaFeAl11O19 and Fe-MFI zeolites differ in the reaction pathways leading to O-2 and N-2. Gas-phase N-2 and O-2 are simultaneously formed over BaFeAl11O19 upon interaction of gas-phase N2O with a bi-atomic surface oxygen (*-O-2) species. Contrarily, the formation of O-2 over Fe-MFI occurs via a sequence of three elementary heterogeneous steps and limits the overall rate of N2O decomposition. Despite the easy O-2 formation. BaFeAl11O19 is less active for N2O decomposition below 973 K than the Fe-MFI zeolites due to the low coverage by *-O-2. According to our quantitative micro-kinetic analysis, this species is formed when gas-phase N2O reacts with a mono-atomic oxygen (*-O) species. This reaction pathway is strongly influenced by the degree of isolation of iron species. The higher the degree of iron isolation in the catalyst, the lower the de-N2O activity. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Herein, we developed a high-efficiency and low-cost three-dimensional (3D) OER electrode via electrochemical integration of amorphous NiFeOOH on surface activated carbon fiber paper (CFP). The as-synthesized 3D-a-NiFeOOH/N-CFP electrode exhibits an ultra-low overpotential eta(O-2) of 170 mV to afford 10 mA cm(-2) current density, together with a Tafel slope of 39 mV per decade, and excellent stability under OER conditions. Apart from the synergistic effect, the excellent OER activity of a-NiFeOOH/N-CFP is attributed to the unique 3D structure with enriched active sites and the improved electrical conductivity that facilitates the fast OER kinetics and mass transport properties. As a result, the catalyst achieves a high turnover frequency (TOF) of 0.99 s(-1) and mass activity (j(m)) of 2527 A g(-1) at eta(O-2) 270 mV, which outperforms so far reported state-of-the-art OER catalysts and commercial IrO2. Besides, an alkaline anion exchange membrane water electrolyzer fabricated with the a-NiFeOOH/N-CFP anode delivers 1 A current at 1.88 V with a long-term durability of 240 h. These findings highlight the design of high-efficiency OER catalysts and significant advancements towards the utilization of NiFeOOH catalysts for commercial applications.									41	0	0	0	2	0	41			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000660080200001

However, the application of ORR is limited due to its inefficiency, which can not only be attributed to the linearity of ORR intermediates binding energies (Eb*OOH, Eb*O, Eb*OH) on the catalyst's active site (represented as *) but also to the serious influences of the watery environment on active sites. In an aqueous environment, catalyst interactions, including covalent, ionic, and van der Waals forces, at the interfacial level are critical in determining the catalytic activity and can considerably alter the kinetics and selectivity of ORR. Therefore, the interfacial confinement's unique properties can provide exciting new possibilities for designing molecular as well as material-based catalysts for ORR. Although several published reviews have focused on developments in interfacial engineering for electrocatalysis, not specifically for ORR, this domain still lacks an inclusive debate on the mechanism of interface structures during ORR. We highlighted the most recent employed strategies for interface structure construction and the role of interfacial interactions during ORR. Finally, the barriers and prospects for the construction of electrocatalysts based on such concepts as control of interfacial interactions, engineering, and technologies are also discussed.(c) 2022 Elsevier B.V.

However, the kinetics of ORR is very sluggish and thus high-performance ORR electrocatalysts are highly regarded. Despite recent progress on minimizing the ORR half -wave potential as the current evaluation indicator, in-depth quantitative kinetic analysis on overall ORR elec-trocatalytic performance remains insufficiently emphasized. In this paper, a quantitative kinetic analysis method is proposed to afford decoupled kinetic information from linear sweep voltammetry profiles on the basis of the Koutecky???Levich equation. Independent parameters regarding exchange current density, electron transfer num-ber, and electrochemical active surface area can be respectively determined following the proposed method.

However, their development is limited by sluggish oxygen redox kinetics, resulting in large overpotential and low cyclic life. Herein, N-NiCoO2/CoO arrays on conductive carbon cloth (noted as NNCO/CC) were designed by a hydrothermal and nitriding method as an ORR/OER bifunctional catalyst for LOB cathode to alleviate this problem. The introduction of N promotes electron redistribution on bimetal sites, which can enhance the affinity of intermediates (O*, LiO2*, Li2O2*) and induce the deposition/decomposition of flake-like amorphous Li2O2. Based on the NNCO/CC cathode, Li-O-2 cells exhibit a low overpotential of 0.35 V and improved cycling capability of over 500 cycles at 0.05 mA cm(-2). The cycle stability could be maintained over 225 cycles with a limited capacity of 0.2 mA h cm(-2). DFT calculations further disclose that NNCO/CC shows a synergistic role in the ORR and OER processes. N-NiCoO2 has a more vital adsorption ability toward key intermediates (LiO2*) in the ORR process and N-CoO has a slight reaction energy barrier in the OER process. The method of regulating the electronic structure of bimetallic oxides to promote synergy in the redox reactions opens up new paths for the functional cathode design of Li-O-2 cells.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000818994000001

ORR) pathway in an acidic electrolyte. However, there is still a lack of effective kinetic computation to reveal M???N???C SACs??? intrinsic catalytical performance toward 2e??? ORR. Here, we combine the experimental and computational efforts to study the 2e??? ORR activity trends of M???N???C SACs (M = Co, Fe, and Mn). The experimental results show that Co???N???C and Mn???N???C SACs favor the 2e??? ORR pathway but Fe???N???C SAC favors the 4e??? ORR pathway. Using systematic kinetic calculation, we demonstrated that desorption of HOOH* or H2O* was a real determining step of the ORR pathway on M???N???C SACs. The difference in the desorption energy between H2O* and HOOH* reaction oxygen intermediates (EH2O* ??? EHOOH*) on a metal active center is a credible descriptor to illustrate and predict the H2O2 selectivity of M???N???C SACs. The predicted high H2O2 selectivity of Ni???N???C SACs from the descriptor is consistent with the experimental results. This study clarifies the mechanism of ORR on M???N???C SACs and identifies the determining factors of the ORR pathway, providing new insights into the rational design of high-H2O2-selectivity M???N???C SACs.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1932-7447	1932-7455		WOS:000819929900001

In this work, we prepared 3D N,P-codoped porous carbon supported with ultrasmall Fe2P nanoparticles (Fe2P/NPC) as high-efficient ORR catalyst by a simple grinding-calcination strategy. As the pore-forming agent, ZnO nanospheres can be in-situ eliminated and generate abundant porous structures which are beneficial to mass transfer. Meanwhile, the large BET surface area (1288 m(2) g(-1)) and pore volume (1.23 cm(3) g(-1)) of Fe2P/NPC can provide more contact active centres for ORR. In alkaline solution, Fe2P/NPC performs excellent ORR activity with the positive onset potential (0.997 V) and half-wave potential (0.872 V), which are more positive than those of the commercial Pt/C (0.977 and 0.812 V). In addition, Fe2P/NPC can be used as air cathode catalyst in a Zn-air battery whose open circuit voltage (1.469 V) is larger than that of the commercial Pt/C (1.332 V) based one. This work provides new strategy to prepare transition metal phosphides/carbon hybrids for electrocatalysis and clean energy conversion systems. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Herein, based on the optimum Ni/Fe/Co ratio (8/1/1) in electrolyte for electrodeposition on nickel foam (NiFeCo/NF), ripple-like sNiFeCo/NF has been prepared as efficient electrode for water oxidation through solvothermal sulfurization. The unique ripple-like structures contain many pores and voids with many wrinkles and distortions, which may enlarge the surface area and expose more active sites, improving the contacting of catalyst/electrolyte interfaces and facilitate electron transfer. sNiFeCo/NF shows better OER activity than NiFeCo/NF, requiring overpotential of 180 mV to deliver 100 mA cm(-2) and a low Tafel slope of 50.4 mV dec(-1). In order to further overcome the poor stability of sNiFeCo/NF, Fe hydroxide film has been electrodeposited on the surface of sNiFeCo/NF (sNiFeCo-Fe/NF), which leads to enhanced stability at the sacrifice of partial activity loss of sNiFeCo/NF. The electrodeposited Fe is supposed to protect NiFeCo-based sulfides from severe corrosion in alkaline and ensure the OER activity in long-term water oxidation. It implies a balance between activity and durability of NiFeCo sulfides. This work may provide a facile routine to fabricate ternary Ni-Fe-Co sulfides as efficient electrocatalyst for water oxidation. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

This approach allows drawing a direct correlation between nanocatalyst size, composition, shape, and its function under realistic reaction conditions for the first time. The approach is illustrated in a chemical industry highly relevant selective partial oxidation of propene on a monodisperse silver nanocatalyst. The shape of the catalyst undergoes rapid change already at room temperature upon the exposure to the reactants, followed by a complex evolution of shape with increasing temperature. Acrolein formation is observed around 50 degrees C while the formation of the propylene oxide exhibits a sharp onset at 80 degrees C and is leveling off at 150 degrees C. At lower temperatures acrolein is produced preferentially to propylene oxide; at temperatures above 100 degrees C propylene oxide is favored. (C) 2009 American Institute of Physics.

Due to the low reaction temperature and N2-free reaction atmosphere, the property of low NOx emission was found in the early days of the technology's development. In CLP, oxygen carriers (OCs) can also remove tar through catalytic cracking, remove pollutants containing S/Cl by reacting with S/Cl to form metal compounds, and promote the conversion of Hg0 to Hg2+ through catalytic oxidation to promote subsequent removal of Hg. Recent advances in the removal of tar- and nitrogen-, sulfur-, chlorine- and mercury-containing pollutants in CLP are reviewed in this paper. On the basis of these findings, the effects of various oxygen carriers, additives and reaction conditions on the removal of various pollutants are discussed. Due to its environmental friendliness and low price, Fe-based OCs, especially Fe-rich natural ores and solid wastes, are the most promising for practical application. It is hoped that the synergistic removal of pollution can be achieved by loading a Cl/S absorbent and active metal oxides on OCs.									5	0	0	0	1	0	5			0378-3820	1873-7188		WOS:000681272800004

Here, we report the preparation and electrochemical performance of cost-effective cobalt-copper bimetallic nanoparticles supported on graphene (CoCu/graphene) as the cathode material for Li-O-2 batteries. The batteries delivered a high initial discharge capacity of 14 821 mA h g(-1) and a low average charge voltage of similar to 4.0 V at 200 mA g(-1). In addition, the batteries exhibited superior rate capability (7955 mA h g(-1) at 800 mA g(-1)), long cyclability (122 cycles at 200 mA g(-1) with a cutoff capacity of 1000 mA h g(-1)), and outstanding coulombic efficiency (92% at 200 mA g(-1)). These superior performances resulted from the synergistic effect of non-noble metal Co and Cu supported on graphene, which could simultaneously enhance the oxygen reduction and evolution reaction kinetics. The favorable composite ensures uniform coverage of nanowall-shaped Li2O2 on CoCu/graphene instead of typical toroidal Li2O2 aggregation, thus promoting the reversible formation and decomposition of discharge product Li2O2. The excellent catalytic performance is expected to provide new insights into designing low-cost and high-efficiency cathode materials for Li-O-2 batteries and promote their practical applications.									49	2	0	0	1	0	48			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000360049900046

Herein, through the electrochemical removal of lithium from LiMn2O4, highly crystalline lambda-MnO2 was prepared as an efficient electrocatalyst for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). The ORR activity of the material was further improved by introducing oxygen vacancies (OVs) that could be achieved by increasing the calcination temperature during LiMn2O4 synthesis; a concentration of oxygen vacancies in LiMn2O4 could be characterized by its voltage profile as the cathode in a lithiun-metal half-cell. lambda-MnO2-z prepared with the highest OV exhibited the highest diffusion-limited ORR current (5.5 mAcm(-2)) among a series of lambda-MnO2-z electrocatalysts. Furthermore, the number of transferred electrons (n) involved in the ORR was > 3.8, indicating a dominant quasi-4-electron pathway. Interestingly, the catalytic performances of the samples were not a function of their surface areas, and instead depended on the concentration of OVs, indicating enhancement in the intrinsic catalytic activity of lambda-MnO2 by the generation of OVs. This study demonstrates that differences in the electrochemical behavior of lambda-MnO2 depend on the preparation method and provides a mechanism for a unique catalytic behavior of cubic lambda-MnO2.									84	8	0	0	8	0	84			1433-7851	1521-3773		WOS:000383253500018	27254822

Although Pt usage can be minimized by the even dispersion of isolated Pt atoms, no atomically dispersed Pt catalysts that promote hydrogen oxidation at a rate required for practical fuel cells have been reported to date. Covalent triazine frameworks with atomically dispersed Pt atoms (0.29 wt%) are described and it is demonstrated that the material has a high electrocatalytic hydrogen oxidation activity without an overpotential. Importantly, when the loading amount was increased to 2.8 wt%, the electrocatalytic hydrogen oxidation activity of the resulting electrode was comparable to that of commercial carbon supported 20 wt% Pt catalysts, and the catalytic activity for oxygen reduction was markedly reduced. Thus, Pt-modified covalent triazine frameworks selectively catalyze hydrogen oxidation, even in the presence of dissolved oxygen, which is critical for limiting cathode degradation during the start-stop cycles of fuel cells.									99	5	0	0	9	0	99			1433-7851	1521-3773		WOS:000385799200045	27633933

This study employs operando electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) to simultaneously monitor the evolution of both transition metal and oxygen redox reactions, as well as their intertwined couplings in Li2MnO3, Li1.2Ni0.2Mn0.6O2, and Li1.2Ni0.13Mn0.54Co0.13O2 cathodes. Reversible O2-/O-2(n-) redox takes place above 3.0 V, which is clearly distinguished from transition metal redox in the operando EPR on Li2MnO3 cathodes. O2-/O-2(n-) redox is also observed in Li1.2Ni0.2Mn0.6O2, and Li1.2Ni0.13Mn0.54Co0.13O2 cathodes, albeit its overlapping potential ranges with Ni redox. This study further reveals the stabilization of the reversible O redox by Mn and e(-) hole delocalization within the Mn-O complex. The interactions within the cation-anion pairs are essential for preventing O-2(n-) from recombination into gaseous O-2 and prove to activate Mn for its increasing participation in redox reactions. Operando EPR helps to establish a fundamental understanding of reversible anionic redox chemistry. The gained insights will support the search for structural factors that promote desirable O redox reactions.									51	7	0	0	1	0	53			1948-7185			WOS:000410600600011	28796514

Herein, we report a facile method to synthesize atomically dispersed Co atoms anchored on nitrogen-doped carbon aerogels with a 3D hierarchically porous network structure via F127-assisted pyrolysis of a phenolic resin/Co2+ composite and subsequent HCl etching treatment. HRTEM, AC-STEM, XRD, XPS, and Raman spectroscopy measurements demonstrate that Co atoms are homogeneously atomically dispersed on nitrogen-doped carbon aerogels within the porous structure by coordination with pyridinic-N. Among a series of samples, the Co-NCA@F127-1: 0.56 catalyst exhibits an enhanced ORR activity with onset potential (E-onset) of 0.935 V vs. RHE, the high diffusion limiting current density of 5.96 mA cm(-2) at 0.45 V, as well as an excellent resistance to methanol poisoning and good long-term stability in alkaline medium, comparable to the state-of-the-art Pt/C catalyst. This work may provide a novel and ingenious thought in the design and engineering of efficient and robust electrocatalysts based on single transition-metal atoms supported by nitrogen-doped carbon materials.

Our labs recently reported on the discovery of oxygen evolution during the LiOH/H2O2-mediated cleavage of Evans oxazolidinone. Faced with this previously unexpected hazard, the authors, herein, report on the development and demonstration of a methodology for the safe scale-up of this O-2-releasing reaction. It was found that O-2 in the headspace could be controlled by a combination of N-2 sweeping and modulation of the LiOH addition rate. A design of experiment study was used to probe the multivariate parameter space in order to minimize formation of the unstable peracid intermediate, thus avoiding accumulation and subsequent risk of rapid and uncontrolled O-2 release. To support scale-up, the well-mixed vapor headspace assumption was tested using computational fluid dynamics, and it was found that N-2 sparging is effective at reducing heterogeneity in the headspace. Condenser conditions were evaluated to balance recovery of solvent-because of the high N-2 sweep-and avoid the risk of condenser freezing-because of the presence of water in the condensate. An additional fail safe was developed, using a pH buffer to rapidly halt the base-catalyzed reaction in the case of an unexpectedly high headspace O-2 concentration. The final process was validated and executed at up to 215 kg scale.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			1083-6160	1520-586X		WOS:000516666200006

Because the oxygen reduction reaction is an important process of fuel cells, it is inevitable to develop a high efficiency catalyst for the reaction. Recent studies have found that agglomerated and over-sized metal nanoparticles may severely affect the oxygen reduction reaction activity of catalysts. In this study, through controlling the acid pickling time of Co@NPC, which is obtained by one-step calcination of ZIF-67 in N-2, a catalyst of fine Co nanoparticles encapsulated in N-doped porous carbon was prepared. Many characterizations, such as high resolution transmission electron microscopy, selected area electron diffraction, elemental mapping, and energy dispersive spectrometry, were performed, and the results indicate that the Co@NPC-acid pickling with a 12 h catalyst produced fine and uniform Co nanoparticles and a complete original frame structure. Although the method to prepare the catalyst is simple, the electrochemical characterizations of the two catalysts indicate that the electrocatalytic ORR performance of the Co@NPC-acid pickling is better than that of Co@NPC, and the Co@NPC-acid pickling with a 12 h catalyst can be comparable with that of the commercial Pt-C in an alkaline environment.

Herein, a roller-comb-like 1D nanostructure is synthesized by a template-assisted method with pyrolysis to create such bifunctional catalysts. Initially, two zeolite imidazole frameworks (ZIF-8 and ZIF-67) are simultaneously grown on polypyrrole (PPy) nanotubes, which are then calcined into 1D N doped carbon nanotubes (NCNTs) modified with Zn, Co nanoparticles and micro-CNTs. The simultaneous formation of two ZIFs on the PPy tubes reduces their particle sizes, which subsequently increases the density of metal nanoparticles on the 1D CNTs. Importantly, the co-deposition of both Zn and Co nanoparticles is a necessary condition to generate a large amount of micro-CNTs, which are embedded with metal nanoparticles at their ends, promoting the connectivity between the metal active sites. The temperature effect on the morphology, composition and properties of pyrolysis products was investigated in detail, which identified that the catalyst synthesised at 800 degrees C exhibited the best bifunctional ORR/OER performance with a Delta E value as low as 0.73 V. A rechargeable Zn-air battery assembled with this catalyst achieves an excellent peak power density of 194.3 mW cm(-2).									7	0	0	0	0	0	7			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000728401100002

Herein, a unique high-surficial multi-heteroatomic catalytic process is realized by rationally design and tailor Ni3Sn2S2 dots-decorated thin Ni3S2 nanosheets to form sheets-on-sheets array self-supported electrode by simple hydrothermal process. The formed Ni3Sn2S2@Ni3S2-2 NF delivers a superior performance very close to the noble catalyst (Pt/C) at low current densities with an onset-potential of nearly 0 mV and overpotentials of 50.7 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) while surprisingly surpassing Pt/C at high current densities. The outstanding HER performance of the catalyst can be ascribed that the rationally tuned multi-heterogeneous interfaces and electronic structure control can realize both strong water absorption and strong H atom desorption to not only significantly promotes fast electron transfer, but also greatly enhances the gas release toward efficient HER. This work holds a great promise to fabricate a non-noble HER catalyst for high-performance close to the noble catalysts such as Pt/C while shedding a light on fundamentals to guide construction of high-surficial heteroatomic multi-heterogeneous catalysts with superior performance.									44	0	0	0	2	0	44			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000518865300007

We reported that the oxidation process involving the reaction rate and the amount of absorbed O atoms could be enhanced by the coupling effect of higher temperatures and larger external tension. By fitting the simulation results, the relationship between absorbed oxygen and the coupling of temperature and strain was obtained. In probing the mechanism, we observed that there was a ballistic transport of O atoms, displaying an enhancement of inward penetration by external tension. Since such an inward transport was favored by thermal actuation, more O atoms penetrated into deeper layers when the 9% strained Si oxidized at 1200K. Moreover, the evolution of stress in the surface region during the oxidation process was discussed, as well as the related oxide structure and the film quality. These present results may provide a way to understand the thermally-mechanically coupled chemical reactions and propose an effective approach to optimize microscale component processing in the electronic field.

Li-rich layered materials and Li-excess disordered rocksalt (DRX) materials deliver excess capacity than the calculated capacity from the redox activity of the transition metals alone.1 Today, it has been widely accepted that the excess capacity can be attributed to the redox activity of oxygen ions in addition to the transition metal ions.2 The cumulative cationic and anionic redox has enabled the achievement of enhanced capacity and energy density. Hence, the development of materials combining anionic andSUMMARYCationic redox-based oxide cathodes have formed the basis of alkali-ion batteries. The limited energy density provided by cationic redox can be overcome by triggering oxygen redox. Hence, oxygen redox has received extensive interest from the perspective of materials development and fundamental understanding. Although oxygen redox is widely studied, there is still much to understand. Consolidating various concepts of oxygen redox (static/dynamic) can inform a unified understanding. Moreover, materials with oxygen redox create significant challenges such as oxygen evolution, voltage hysteresis/fading, and chemical/structural transformations. A consensus is yet to be achieved on the interrelationship of these phenomena due to the chemical/structural complexities at different length and time scales. Given the great potential of these materials for next-generation batteries, a review of the recent understanding of oxygen redox is timely. In this review, the mechanistic understandings, and challenges and their mitigation with oxygen redox are summarized by integrating various schools of thought.									23	1	0	0	1	0	23			2590-2393	2590-2385		WOS:000632645300009

Beyond thermodynamic-based material-screening concepts: Kinetic scaling relations exemplified by the chlorine evolution reaction over transition-metal oxides								ELECTROCHIMICA ACTA				334						135555	10.1016/j.electacta.2019.135555				FEB 20 2020	2020	State-of-the-art material screening in the field of electrocatalysis mainly uses the concept of linear scaling relationships in order to express the (free) adsorption energies of different reaction intermediates, adsorbed on the surface of a solid-state electrocatalyst, as function of a descriptor. This thermodynamic analysis, based on the application of the computational hydrogen electrode approach (CHE), ultimately results in the construction of a Volcano plot, which facilitates identifying promising catalysts within a class of materials. The conventional ab initio Volcano concept, however, lacks of two critical aspects: on the one hand the applied overpotential, which constitutes the driving force of an electrocatalytic reaction, is not included in the underlying approach, since the thermodynamic analysis refers to the standard equilibrium potential of the electrocatalytic process; on the other hand, the kinetics is not accounted for. Herein, an alternate material-screening concept is presented, which promotes a discussion of the catalytic performance within a class of materials by explicitly including both the kinetic description and applied overpotential: kinetic scaling relations enable resolving the ratedetermining reaction step in a homologous series of single-crystalline electrocatalysts in the overpotential regime of interest for practical applications. The proposed methodology is exemplified by the chlorine evolution reaction over transition-metal oxides, which corresponds to the anode reaction in the industrially relevant chlor-alkali process for the production of gaseous chlorine as basic chemical.

An efficient strategy to enhance HER activity concerns with designing suitable substrates for constructing composite materials. Herein, a new hybrid electrocatalyst, consisting of FeP (iron phosphide) nanoparticles (NPs) anchored on 3D structured graphene (3DG) is investigated towards HER. 3DG substrates are pretreated by an intermittent microwave heating (IMH) method, following the procedure 5s-ON/5s-OFF, repeated for different times. It is found that the as resulted 3DG20 substrate (submitted to 20 repetitions), is favorable for the uniform dispersion of FeP nanoparticles, which presents large specific surface area, abundant oxygen functional groups and easy electron and mass transfer. The as-prepared FeP/3DG20 electrocatalyst displays good HER activity and stability, requiring relatively small overpotentials of -113.2 and -211.4 mV to deliver current densities of -10 and -200 mA cm(-2) in 0.5 M H2SO4 aqueous solution, the corresponding mechanism is discussed. Thus, this study might provide a prospective strategy to enhance HER catalytic efficiency by exploiting the synergy between electrocatalysts and support materials. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

For the commercialization of SOFC and SOEC technologies, operation at the intermediate-low temperature (IT) is the current major research direction all over the world, which are beneficial for the operation of SOFC and SOEC more durably and economically. The key point is how to improve the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) or oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity of oxygen electrodes. In this review, the important roles of atomic-scale molecular simulation and in-situ experimental characterization are mainly illustrated to provide insight and understanding on the oxygen transport mechanism analysis. These fundamental studies could put forward the progress from traditional materials and structures to novel designs and concepts. The recent R&D oxygen electrodes of mixed ionic electronic conducting (MIEC) materials, the corresponding ion migration paths, anisotropic structures and lattice dynamics are summarized in detail. The current advanced research methods and characterizations are introduced focusing on the in-situ X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and Auger electron spectroscopy (AES) for probing the surface chemical composition and structure of materials. With in-situ methods, a several nanometers to tens of nanometers structure of the dense film could be visualized that made the study of the formation and migration of charged defects of oxygen electrode material feasible. Oxygen transport mechanisms in the traditional materials and novel materials at atomic scale are analyzed by the results of density functional theory (DFT) calculations and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. Furthermore, the research progress of oxygen electrodes at INET in Tsinghua University is briefly introduced.									2	0	0	0	1	0	2			1005-281X			WOS:000342334700011

Here, we demonstrate that the porous, nanocrystalline NiOx electrocatalyst integrated with a thermally-grown SiO2 protection layer results in unexpectedly high PEC performances as well as long-term stability in Si photoanodes. The porous structure of NiO(x )and its large active area in contact to the electrolyte improves electrocatalytic activity and greatly reduces the kinetic overpotential required for charge transfer. In addition, the redox-active surface contributed by nanocrystalline nature of NiOx results in the accumulation of charges during the PEC reaction, predominantly affecting the interface energetics of NiOx/n-Si junctions. This feature enables a high open circuit potential of similar to 0.6 V even without p-n junctions. Stoichiometric SiO2 affords strong electrochemical corrosion resistance during the PEC water oxidation in 1 M KOH electrolyte, in contrast to the wet chemical-grown, nonstoichiometric SiOx. The porous and nanocrystalline NiOx and stoichiometric SiO2 incorporated in the n-Si photoanode ensures continuous operation for 100 h at high performance. These results can help inform a new way to design a high performance Si photoanodes with long-term stability.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000502007800108

Among them, metal porphyrin (particularly Fe-porphyrin) based carbon catalysts are considered the best substitutes of Pt. Therefore, understanding the ORR mechanism of the Fe-porphyrin system is important to further improve the activity and durability of ORR catalysts. Herein, we performed density functional theory (DFT) calculations to elucidate ORR pathways catalyzed by Fe-porphyrin centers at different pH values. The calculated thermodynamic parameters of four electron transfer (ET) steps revealed that axial coordination of hydroxyl anions at high pH helps increase the onset potential, inspiring us to explore the energetics of microstates of the first ET step in greater detail. The results suggest that the open-shell singlet bound state of O-2 and O-2(-) is particularly stable, with its protonation therefore being rather slow. We compare our results with previously reported experimental results, discussing the effect of the pH on the ORR activity and kinetics of Fe-porphyrin electrochemical catalytic systems, and anticipate that the presented detailed mechanistic study based on DFT-determined energetic parameters will provide insights into and help develop guidelines for the successful development of Fe-porphyrin-based ORR catalysts.					4th Ertl Symposium on Water at Interfaces4th Ertl Symposium on Water at Interfaces	OCT 11-13, 2016OCT 11-13, 2016	Fritz Haber Inst Max Planck Gesell; GIST Ertl CtrFritz Haber Inst Max Planck Gesell; GIST Ertl Ctr	Berlin, GERMANYBerlin, GERMANY	9	0	0	0	0	0	9			0920-5861	1873-4308		WOS:000407247800016

This was shown earlier when the major electrochemical reactions at the anode were chlorine and oxygen evolution and the impact of chlorine in EchT was investigated by mathematical modelling. In this work the electrochemical illustration of a mathematical model of electrochemical treatment of tumours is presented using a Pt electrode placed in agar-agar gel containing 1% phenolphthalein and NaCl. The appearance of the bright red color around the Pt wire due to the pH change caused by hydrogen evolution is used for the simulation of the shape and the boundaries of the tumour tissue. After the polarity was changed, oxygen evolution takes place on the Pt wire electrode and the red color disappears simulating the destructive influence of the electrochemical process on tumour tissue. A better understanding of the mathematical model presented earlier is achieved and it can be used for educational purposes in oncological praxis because agar-agar is the closest approximation to the ground substance of connective human tissue and successfully simulates the processes which occur in vivo. There is also some quantitative agreement between the results calculated earlier and those obtained in this work. The previous model was based on tissue, which was treated as an aqueous solution of sodium chloride containing bicarbonate and proteins and the results presented a detailed and useful quantitative analysis of the system. In this work, the quantitative analysis presented is based on an agar-agar system and the experimental conditions give the possibility of more detailed qualitative analysis. The combination of these two models offers a better simulation of the processes in vivo. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science B.V.

Electrochemical de-alloying of mixed-metal nanoparticles is a promising strategy to modify catalysts' surface chemistry and/or induce lattice strain to alter their electronic structure. Perfect design of the electrochemical de-alloying strategy to modify the catalyst's d-band center position can yield significant improvement on the catalytic performance of the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). Herein, carbon supported PtCu catalysts are prepared by a simple polyol method followed by an electrochemical de-alloying treatment to form PtCu/C catalysts with a Pt-enriched porous shell with improved catalytic activity. Although the pristine PtCu/C catalyst exhibits a mass activity of 0.64 A mg(Pt)(-1), the dissolution of Cu atoms from the catalyst surface after electrochemical de-alloying cycling leads to a significant enhancement in mass activity (1.19 A mg(Pt)(-1)), which is 400% better than that of state-of-the-art commercial Pt/C (0.24 A mg(Pt)(-1)). Furthermore, the de-alloyed PtCu/C-10 catalyst with a Pt-enriched shell delivers prolonged stability (loss of only 28.6% after 30 000 cycles), which is much better than that of Pt/C with a loss of 45.8%. By virtue of scanning transmission electron microscopy and elemental mapping experiments, the morphology and composition evolution of the catalysts could clearly be elucidated. This work helps in drawing a roadmap to design highly active and stable catalyst platforms for the ORR and relevant proton exchange membrane fuel cell applications.									9	0	0	0	0	0	9			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000683053100001	34477663

Herein, we report a one-step simple method for the large-scale synthesis of Co/Ni-MoO2 composite as efficient and stable hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) electrocatalyst to drive 10 mA cm(-2) current density with a low overpotential of 103 my in basic media. Co-MoO2 and Ni-MoO2 were also prepared using this method with overpotential of 137 and 130 mV, respectively, to gain the same current density. These results indicate that this facile synthesis approach is of great practical importance as it can be easily used for large-scale preparation of electrocatalysts in industry.

Dual Behavior of Dispersed Ni Nanoparticles for Hydrogen Evolution Reaction at the Interface of Ni/Alkaline Solution								JOURNAL OF THE ELECTROCHEMICAL SOCIETY				168	9					096512	10.1149/1945-7111/ac2926				SEP 1 2021	2021	The electrode kinetic parameters, that is, the interaction parameter (g), fractional coverage (theta), and equilibrium constant (K), for the Frumkin adsorption isotherm in the Volmer step cannot be readily determined using conventional methods. These parameters for the Frumkin isotherm of H for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in the Ni/0.1 M KOH (H2O and H2O + dispersed Ni nanoparticles) solutions were determined using the phase-shift method. The Frumkin isotherms of H are K = 9.8 x 10(-4) exp(-5.7 theta) mol(-1) for the 0.1 M KOH (H2O) solution and K (NPs) = 1.2 x 10(-4) exp(-3.5 theta) mol(-1) for the 0.1 M KOH (H2O + dispersed Ni NPs) solution. The dispersed Ni NPs behave as electrostatic shielding for the H adsorption in the Volmer step and as an electrocatalyst for the H-2 evolution in the Tafel and/or Heyrovsky steps. The dual behavior of the dispersed Ni NPs in the HER was similar regardless of the weight of the dispersed Ni NPs. The electrostatic shielding behavior of the dispersed Ni NPs in the HER has been previously overlooked or missed. We hope that the dual behavior of dispersed NPs at the interfaces of electrocatalysts/solutions will be studied in more detail for their potential applications.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0013-4651	1945-7111		WOS:000702053300001

Here, a controllable calcination route was developed for the partial decomposition of ultrathin 2D Ni-based MOF (2D Ni-MOF) precursors to fabricate ultrafine NiO nanoparticles (NPs) within the ultrathin 2D Ni-MOF. In particular, 2D Ni-MOF precursors (thickness: similar to 2 nm), for the first time, were rapidly synthesized via a microwave-assisted solvothermal method. The controllable calcination route effectively retained the ultrathin 2D porous nanostructure of the MOFs, and simultaneously enabled the formation of defect-rich ultrafine NiO NPs within the 2D Ni-MOF. Benefiting from the unique nanostructure (i.e., ultrathin 2D nanosheets) and highly active sites (i.e., defect-rich NiO NPs), the partially decomposed 2D Ni-MOF-250 exhibited excellent performance for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) with an overpotential of 250 mV at 50 mA cm(-2) in 1 M KOH, outperforming those obtained from other reported nonprecious-metal-based electrocatalysts. More importantly, 2D Ni-MOF-250 could achieve the industry-related current density of 1000 mA cm(-2) at a small overpotential of 410 mV, demonstrating its promising potential for use in practical applications. Therefore, the controllable calcination route may stand out as a facile yet robust route for smartly fabricating defect-rich metal oxides within MOFs toward efficient electrocatalysis.									40	4	0	0	2	0	41			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000511170800057

The uniform nanorods of CdS provide a larger specific surface and a shorter charge transfer distance, which is beneficial for the separation of electron-hole pairs, thus having a great promotion effect on the increase of its H2O2 yield. Under ambient conditions and organic electron donor free, CdS nanorods achieve photocatalytic water splitting through the oxygen reduction reaction and water oxidation reaction with a high H2O2 yield of 1127 mu mol h(-1) g(-1).									3	0	0	0	1	0	3			2052-1553			WOS:000764249100001

In the CaCl(2) at about 800 degrees C, UO(2) was reduced into metal over the potential range < 0.6 V vs the Ca(2+)/Ca. The reduced uranium metal cohered due to the high temperature and a dense metal skin covered the surface of the UO(2) disk sample. It prevented the transportation of oxygen from the inside to the bulk salt and the reduction often stopped with UO(2) remaining inside. A significant underpotential deposition of calcium metal was observed. In the LiCl at 650 degrees C, UO(2) was reduced into metal over the potential range < 0.15 V vs the Li(+)/Li. The UO(2) disk sample was satisfactorily reduced because the LiCl melt could permeate into the sample. The current efficiency of UO(2) reduction in the LiCl was much better than in the CaCl(2). The anodic currents for oxygen and carbon oxide gas evolutions were verified in cyclic voltammograms of the platinum and glassy carbon electrodes. At the platinum surface, Pt(3)O(4) and Li(2)PtO(3) yielded in the CaCl(2) and LiCl, respectively. (c) 2006 The Electrochemical Society.									144	6	2	0	1	0	149			0013-4651			WOS:000235136600052

The Journal of chemical physics				156	24			244706	244706		10.1063/5.0097762				2022-Jun-28	2022	Commercial titania photocatalysts were modified with silver nanoparticles (NPs) by the photodeposition method in the presence/absence of methanol. The obtained photocatalysts were characterized by XRD, XPS, diffuse reflectance spectroscopy, STEM, and time-resolved microwave conductivity (TRMC) methods. The photocatalytic activity was tested under UV/vis irradiation for (i) methanol dehydrogenation (during silver deposition), (ii) oxygen evolution with in situ silver deposition, and (iii) oxidative decomposition of acetic acid, as well as under vis irradiation for 2-propanol oxidation. The action spectra of 2-propanol oxidation were also performed. It has been confirmed that modification of titania with silver causes significant improvement of photocatalytic activity under both UV and vis irradiation as silver works as an electron scavenger (TRMC data) and vis activator (possibly by an energy transfer mechanism). The obtained activities differ between titania samples significantly, suggesting that the type of crystalline phase, particle/crystallite sizes, and electron traps' density are crucial for both the properties of formed silver deposits and resultant photocatalytic activity. It might be concluded that, under UV irradiation, (i) high crystallinity and large specific surface area are recommended for rutile- and anatase-rich samples, respectively, during hydrogen evolution, (ii) mixed crystalline phases cause a high rate of oxygen evolution from water, and (iii) anatase phase with fine silver NPs results in efficient decomposition of acetic acid, whereas under vis irradiation the aggregated silver NPs (broad localized surface plasmon resonance peak) on the rutile phase are promising for oxidation reactions.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2				1089-7690		MEDLINE:35778099	35778099

There was a significant loss in chlorophyll (a + b) content and photochemical activities during prolonged leaf stay in darkness. The polyacrylamide gel electrophoretic analysis of the proteins of thylakoids and PS2 complex showed a differential rate of degradation of some functionally known polypeptides during dark aging. The degradations of 33 x 10(3) and 24 x 10(3), the two extrinsic polypeptides involved in oxygen evolution of thylakoid membranes, were relatively faster than that of 18 x 10(3) during aging. The loss in pigment content was inhibited by benzyladenine (BA) and accelerated by ethylene when treated to the senescing leaves. BA treatment retarded and ethylene treatment accelerated the protein degradation of the thylakoid membrane and the PS2 complex. The loss of 33 x 10(3) and 24 x 10(3) polypeptides could be one of the reasons for the loss of photochemical functions of the thylakoid membrane and PS2 complex during senescence of detached leaves in the dark.									10	1	0	0	8	0	10			0300-3604	1573-9058		WOS:A1990FA30400008

Herein, a series of identical two-dimensional BiOI nanosheets with various concentration of oxygen vacancies are rationally fabricated through a facile ion-exchange and annealing process under Ar atmosphere. The presence of oxygen vacancies has been identified by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM). The X-ray diffraction (XRD) and field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) are used to probe the evolution of crystal structure and morphology of the product. Electrochemical data show that reduced two-dimensional BiOI nanosheets electrodes with appropriate oxygen vacancies exhibit a significant improvement on capacitance compared to the pristine electrodes. The specific capacitance of the as-prepared BiOI-600 electrode reaches 620 F g(-1) (at 0.5 A g(-1)), and 65 % capacitance retention after 1000 cycles at 2 A g(-1). The good electrochemical performances can be mainly ascribed to the convenient diffusion of electrolyte ions (e.g. two dimensional nanosheets) and more surface active sites (e.g. oxygen vacancies) for redox reactions. These findings provide new chance for the oxygen-vacancies-rich two-dimensional BiOI nanosheets as high-performance supercapacitor electrodes.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			1452-3981			WOS:000560655800068

However, a major challenge is to accelerate the sluggish oxygen evolution reaction (OER) kinetics with a multistep proton-coupled electron-transfer process. Transition metal Ni-and Co-based composites have been developed to replace expensive and scare noble metal based OER catalysts. So far, layered NiFe double hydroxide represents the best OER activity among all Ni-and Co-based oxides. Herein, monodispersed ternary (Ni1-xFex)(12)P-5 nanocrystalline materials with tunable Ni/Fe ratios are reported as highly efficient OER electrocatalysts, exhibiting activity and stability surpassing noble metal OER catalysts including RuO2, IrO2, and superior to nickel phosphides, layered nickel-iron double hydroxides, and other NiFe-based OER catalysts. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) studies reveals that enhanced charge transfer from the foreign metal (Fe) to the host (Ni) to P atoms and a strong synergistic effect exist in the composite (Ni1-xFex) P-12(5) electrocatalysts, thus rendering the as-prepared (Ni1-xFex)(12)P-5 nanocrystalline compounds (NCs) with a Ni/Fe ratio of 0.51/0.49, the highest OER activity with a small onset potential of 125 mV, a low Tafel slope of 39 mV dec(-1), and a low overpotential of 216 mV, to achieve 20 mA cm(-2) in an alkaline medium electrolyte (1.0 M KOH).									34	1	0	0	0	0	34			2196-0216			WOS:000410500100005

The method yielded N-doped graphene nanosheets that had high surface areas and that contained 9.22 at% nitrogen, which was present in four bonding configurations with a high ratio of pyridinic N and graphitic N. The synthesized N-doped graphene showed excellent capacitance properties, which led to the fabrication of a stacked electrode supercapacitor cell of 2-electrode configuration with a specific capacitance of 230 F g(-1) at a current density of 1 A g(-1) and with a remarkably high energy density of 62.6 W h kg(-1) in aqueous electrolyte. Additionally, this material showed superior properties as an electrocatalyst for both the oxygen-reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER), producing high current density primarily via the four-electron pathway for ORR at a current density of -4.3 mA cm(-2) and OER activity of a generating current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at 1.74 V vs. RHE in alkaline media. Hence, this dual-natured N-doped graphene could provide a platform for developing nanostructured graphene-based advanced energy storage and conversion devices.									84	4	0	0	6	0	85				2046-2069		WOS:000399005200048

Electroplating of nanocrystalline metals and their alloys thin film is auspicious for the conversion and storage of the energy in the form of hydrogen fuel during water electrolysis. In this work, we electroplated the nanocrystalline Ni-Co alloys of different Co% using natural compounds such as gluconate and cysteine via the galvanostatic-ultrasonication conditions. The electroplated Ni-Co alloys have been characterized using energy dispersive X-ray, X-ray diffraction and scanning electron microscopy, to determine their elemental composition, crystal lattice system and surface morphology, respectively. The morphological structure of the electroplated Ni-Co alloys varies from dense and lustrous to granular. The electroplated Ni-Co alloys arranged in the face centred cubic or hexagonal closed packaged depending on the Co%. The electroplated Ni-Co alloys arranged in the small unit cell which enhances electron transfer and boosts the rate of hydrogen reduction. The electrocatalytic activity of the electroplated Ni-Co cathodes towards hydrogen reduction reaction was investigated using cathodic polarization and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, EIS, dipped in 1.0 M KOH solution. The electroplated Ni-50Co cathode displays the superior electrocatalytic activity and the lowest overpotential for the hydrogen evolution reaction than bulk Ni.

The approach described opens up the possibility of assessing the electrocatalytic activity of films produced by high throughput deposition techniques, especially conducting films formed on insulators. This is particularly valuable for testing novel oxygen reduction or oxygen evolution catalysts. SCV is a transient technique, yet for processes affected by mass transport, it produces sigmoidal current-voltage curves, which can be analysed as conventional steady state voltammograms. Selecting different sampling times affords a range of mass transfer coefficients and this is particularly useful to determine kinetic parameters. The applicability of SCV is first assessed with the fast electron transfer between ferri and ferrocyanide ions and an excellent agreement between the SCV and RDE methods is found. Then, SCV is used to investigate the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) on a stationary polycrystalline Pt disc, on a polycrystalline Pt foil and on a thin Pt film orientated in the (110) direction. The results are systematically compared with those from a rotated polycrystalline Pt disc. Importantly, the sampled current voltammograms (SCVs) are found to be sufficiently sensitive to reveal differences in electrocatalytic activity between the Pt electrodes and between different sulfate concentrations. The technique is thus well adapted to probing variations in catalytic activity due to surface structure or interactions between solution species and surface sites. For polycrystalline Pt, the ORR kinetic parameters obtained from the Koutecky-Levich (K-L) analysis of the SCVs are in good agreement with those obtained with the RDE. Overall, the sampled current voltammetry approach reported here provides a valuable alternative to steady state voltammetry, and it is particularly suited to assess the electrocatalytic properties of surfaces where epitaxial thin film electrodes are grown on insulating substrates. The methodology could easily be extended to other substrates such as catalysts deposited on gas diffusion electrodes. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

The high cost and complex fabrication process of advanced energy nanomaterials, however, has impeded the practical application of emerging sustainable technologies. The direct use of earth-abundant natural minerals which contain active elements for effective catalysis and energy storage should be a promising approach to achieve affordable sustainable energy supply and green fuel generations. Herein, as typical examples of activating natural minerals for electrocatalysis, two common minerals, pyrite and chalcopyrite, are activated via a one-step phase transformation strategy. Through a facile thermal reduction process, the minerals are completely transformed into active pyrrhotite (FeS) and haycockite (Cu4Fe5S8) phases. The thermal reduction resulting phase transformation can lead to significant surface disordering and can contribute to the catalytic activity by offering favourable electronic structure for intermediates adsorption, abundant surficial active centres, and substantial surface redox pairs. The activated minerals are examined for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalysis. The obtained haycockite phase delivers the best performance towards acidic HER and alkaline OER. Further phase optimization is performed via loading a low percentage of iridium nanoclusters on the haycockite phase deposited onto a carbon cloth substrate, through which an overpotential as low as 310 mV for achieving 10 mA cm(-2) and a small Tafel slope of 55.6 mV dec(-1) are recorded for alkaline OER. This work demonstrates the feasibility of the direct use of cost-effective natural resources for addressing the current energy-related issues and paves a way to reach affordable practical emerging sustainable technologies.

However, how to increase the electron transfer efficiency of TiO2-based catalyst is still a challenge. In this work TiO2 homojunction (TiO2 NBs@TiO2 NSs) with Au nanoparticles (Au NPs) depositing on its surface (TiO2 NBs@TiO2 NSs@Au NPs) was successfully prepared through a simple hydrothermal method. This unique homojunction structure can effectively accelerate the electrons transfer, and Au NPs are effective HER co-catalyst because of its low overpotential, high activity. This catalyst has been proved as an outstanding HER electrocatalyst in acidic electrolyte, with a low onset potential of -230 mV, overpotential of 440 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) and high long-term durability, which opens a new avenue for designing and developing TiO2-based materials for electrochemical energy applications.									7	0	0	0	0	0	7			1044-5803	1873-4189		WOS:000467668600033

Major focus is on the dynamics of suboxic zone which is the interface separating oxygenated and anoxic waters. The scatter of oxygen data seen when plotted in density coordinates is larger than those for temperature, salinity and passive tracers. This scatter is indicative of vigorous biogeochemical reactions in the suboxic zone, which acts as a boundary layer or internal sink for oxygen. This internal sink affects the mixing patterns of oxygen compared to the ones of conservative tracers. Two different regimes of ventilation of pycnocline were clearly identified: a gyre-dominated (cyclonic) regime in winter and a coastal boundary layer (anticyclonic eddy)-dominated regime in summer. These contrasting states are characterized by very different pathways of oxygen intrusions along the isopycnals and vertical oxygen conveyor belt organized in multiple-layered cells formed in each gyre. The contribution of the three-dimensional modelling to the understanding of the Black Sea hydro-chemistry, and in particular the coast-to-open-sea mixing, is also demonstrated. Evidence is given that the formation of oxic waters and of cold intermediate waters, although triggered by the same physical process, each follow a different evolution. The difference in the depths of the temperature minimum and the oxygen maximum indicates that the variability of oxygen is not only just a response to physical forcing and changes in the surface conditions, but undergoes its own evolution.									40	0	1	0	14	0	42			1726-4170	1726-4189		WOS:000344649300004

Detailed information on the dynamic exchange of adsorbed ions, on the stability/decomposition of the ionic liquid, and on the activity/selectivity/reversibility of the ORR is derived from measurements performed under potentiodynamic and potentiostatic conditions. In neat BMP-TFSI, we find the dynamics of the potential induced exchange of adsorbed ions to depend significantly on the exchange direction. In the presence of O-2, the anions formed in the ORR distinctly affect the adsorption characteristics of the IL ions and the exchange dynamics. Furthermore, the ORR changes from reduction to superoxide anions at moderate potentials to reduction to peroxide anion at more negative potentials. In the additional presence of Mg2+ ions, dominant magnesium peroxide and oxide formation result in an irreversible ORR, in contrast to the requirements of an efficient re-chargeable Mg-air battery. In addition, these ions result in the increasing formation of a blocking adlayer, reducing the coverage of adsorbed IL species.

J	Qu, Yuning; Wen, Shuya; Chen, Jianhong; Shen, Honghui; Yu, Wenjie; Wei, Dan; Yu, Jianguo; Kwon, Young-Uk; Zhao, Yongnan								Nafion-assisted synthesis of palladium nanonetworks as efficient electrocatalysts for hydrogen evolution reaction								IONICS				26	3			1347	1356		10.1007/s11581-019-03276-y		NOV 2019		MAR 2020	2020	In this work, we synthesized a Pd nanonetwork (PdNN) catalyst by employing Nafion as structure-directing agent. The nanonetwork-like structure is interconnected by Pd particles. Moreover, the morphologies and the sizes of PdNN samples can be tunable by adjusting concentrations of Pd precursor. The as-prepared PdNN catalysts have superior hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) performance to that of commercial Pd/C. Among them, PdNN-4.5 catalysts exhibit the most excellent hydrogen evolution performance, which contains an overpotential of 59 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) and a Tafel slope of only 54 mV dec(-1). Besides, a super stability is also displayed for PdNN-4.5 catalysts. The significant improvement in the HER performance of the PdNN-4.5 catalyst may be attributed to the nanonetwork-like structure, the sizes, and the interaction between the Pd catalysts and Nafion. Thus, this work can provide a simple method for synthesizing the highly efficient Pd-based catalyst for HER.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			0947-7047	1862-0760		WOS:000495061300003
